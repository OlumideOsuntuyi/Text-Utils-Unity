He was most familiar for his progressive approach to Corrections and being the respondent in the famous U.S. Supreme Court Landmark Case "Gideon v. Wainwright".

His tenure as Secretary is noted for a shift in corrections philosophy away from centuries of barbaric treatment of those incarcerated. As Florida’s corrections leader he established prisoner’s education and job training, and pushed for transparency of the entire system.  He believed that in no other position would he have had the freedom and obligation to solve problems and help people on a daily basis. He would often say it was his calling. 

Whether helping those who were incarcerated or supporting the dedicated staff across the prison system, his passion for human rights always guided his decisions, regardless of political consequences. 

His legacy includes an enduring chapter of Florida’s history for ensuring appropriate operations, employee treatment, offender program quality, and inmate health and safety as well as his leadership within the American Corrections Association (ACA). He was the driving force in the early to mid-seventies for the ACA’s national campaign to establish the Corrections Accreditation Commission. Florida’s Institutions, then totaling 24, were the first in the nation to achieve accreditation in 1981. In 1984, the Florida Department of Corrections' Central Office earned its accreditation, making Florida the first correctional agency in the nation to be fully accredited. 

He was acknowledged as the Dean of American Correctional Administrators. He was the longest-serving Correctional Secretary or Director in the United States. He has received the American Correctional Association’s highest tribute, the E.R. Cass Award for his outstanding service. His efforts in support of accreditation in Florida and nationwide earned him the 1986 Accreditation Achieved Award from the Commission of Accreditation for Corrections. 

Wainwright is most famous for being named the respondent in two US Supreme Court cases. The first was Gideon vs Wainwright, in which the United States Supreme Court held that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee a right of legal counsel to anyone accused of a crime. Time magazine called the Gideon decision one of the ten most important legal events of the 1960s. Gideon remains one of the most familiar names to students of habeas corpus law.

Lewis gun

The Lewis gun (or Lewis automatic machine gun or Lewis automatic rifle) is a First World War–era light machine gun.

The Lewis gun was invented by U.S. Army colonel Isaac Newton Lewis in 1911, based on initial work by Samuel Maclean.

The start of the First World War increased demand for the Lewis gun. BSA began production, under the name "Model 1914". The design was officially approved for service on 15 October 1915 under the name "Gun, Lewis, .303-cal." No Lewis guns were produced in Belgium during the war; all manufacture was carried out by BSA in England and the Savage Arms Company in the US.

The Lewis was produced by BSA and Savage Arms during the war. The two versions were very similar, but there were enough differences to stop them being completely interchangeable. This problem was fixed by the time of the Second World War.

The Lewis gun was gas operated. 

The Lewis gun used a pan magazine holding 47 or 97 rounds.

The gun fired about 500–600 rounds per minute. It weighed 28 lb (12.7 kg), only about half as much as a typical medium machine gun of the era, such as the Vickers machine gun. It could be carried and used by one soldier.

During the first days of the war, the Belgian Army had put in service 20 prototypes (5 in 7.65×53mm and 15 in .303) for the defense of Namur.

The Lewis was the first machine gun fired from an airplane. On 7 June 1912, Captain Charles Chandler of the US Army fired a Lewis gun from the foot-bar of a Wright Model B Flyer.

Nicholas Alahverdian

Nicholas Alahverdian (born 1987/1988) is an American sex offender who faked his own death in 2020.

Alahverdian said that he was abused as a minor while under the care of the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth & Families. Over this, he sued the organization in 2011 in federal court, then withdrew the lawsuit when Rhode Island waived his ~$200,000 medical fees.

In 2008, Alahverdian, then known as Nicholas Rossi, was convicted of "sexual imposition" and public indecency over an incident with another student at Ohio's Sinclair Community College, where he studied in. Alahverdian requested that the trial be restarted based on new evidence from the Internet. A computer expert analyzed the new evidence in 2011. He was 90% confident that it was fake, pointing to a date error which only a human would make, not a computer. The judge refused Alahverdian's request for the trial as the new evidence was "not credible".

In 2015, Alahverdian was married for the second time; the couple ended their marriage by 2017, after a court ruled that Alahverdian was "guilty of gross neglect of duty and extreme cruelty" towards his wife.

In January 2020, Alahverdian said that he had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. According to his family, Alahverdian died of the disease on February 29, 2020. His wife said that Alahverdian would be cremated and that Alahverdian's remains would be scattered at sea. Upon Alahverdian's death, WPRI reported that he had moved out of the United States around four years earlier, with his wife saying that it was because they were not safe in the United States.

In July 2020, Rhode Island State Police looked into whether Alahverdian's reported death was real; no conclusion was reached by January 2021. The investigation occurred due to claims that Alahverdian was still alive, plus a warrant against Alahverdian as he was accused of failing to register as a sex offender in Rhode Island due to his 2008 conviction.

Just before his illness and death, Alahverdian knew that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating him for fraud, said his former lawyer Jeffrey Pine. The FBI's investigation happened because his foster mother Sharon Lane claimed that he opened 22 credit cards under her husband's name, spending over $200,000 which her husband now owed. Pine was suspicious whether Alahverdian really died, because his illness and death were reported so quickly after Alahverdian learned of the FBI investigation. Lane believed that Alahverdian was still alive, because in her opinion, the obituary and memorials written about him had a writing style matching Alahverdian's.

A person claiming to be Alahverdian's widow denied that he had faked his death, but also refused to provide copies of his death certificate to the media. According to a Rhode Island pastor, he had been contacted by a person claiming to be Alahverdian's widow, who had requested the holding of a mass in tribute to Alahverdian. The pastor said that a Rhode Island policeman told him not to hold the event, and that the policeman also said that Alahverdian had faked his death, with the person claiming to be Alahverdian's widow possibly being Alahverdian himself using a "device that can change people's voices". A person claiming to be Alahverdian's widow, 'Louise', also sent an email in January 2021 to "The Providence Journal", which included criticism of people who had past connections to Alahverdian, including the victim of Alahverdian's sexual offenses, the police officer who took Alahverdian's sexual offenses case, the judge who oversaw Alahverdian's sexual offenses case, and Alahverdian's former foster parents.

Neo-Assyrian Empire

The Neo-Assyrian Empire was an empire in Mesopotamia during the Iron Age. During its existence from 911-609 BC, it was the largest empire in the world up to that time, doing many early techniques of imperialism which became normal in later empires. It was, according to many historians, the first real empire in history. It also pioneered many tactics such as arming themselves with iron weapons and employing advanced, effective military tactics.

After the conquests of Adad-nirari II in the 900s BC, the Neo-Assyrian Empire became the successor to the Old Assyrian Empire (2025-1378 BC) and the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365-934 BC), and dominated the Ancient Near East, the East Mediterranean, Asia Minor, the Caucasus, and parts of both the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa, conquering and lasting longer than their rivals, such as Babylonia, Elam, Persia, Urartu, Lydia, the Medes, Phrygia, the Cimmerians, Israel, Judah, Phoenicia, the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Canaan, the Kushite Empire, and Ancient Egypt.

The empire began to fall in 631 BC when Ashurbanipal died, and many civil wars, allowing Cyaxares, King of Persia and the Medes, to form an alliance with Nabopolassar, Ruler of Babylonia and the Cimmerians and invade Assyria. Assyria allied itself with Egypt, but they both fell at the Fall of Harran in 609 BC. The second Siege of Harran finally ended Assyria. However, even today there are still Assyrian people living in Iran, Iraq, and elsewhere.

The campaigns of Adad-nirari II allowed Assyria to become a great power after overthrowing the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt and conquering Elam, Urartu, Media, Persia, Mannea, Gutium, Phoenicia/Canaan, Arabia, Israel, Judah, Philistia, Edom, Moab, Samarra, Cilicia, Cyprus, Chaldea, Nabatea, Commagene, Dilmun, Shutu, and the Neo-Hittites, as well as removing the Nubians, Kushites, and Ethiopians from Egypt and forcing a tribute from Phrygia and others. In addition, he and his successors conquered areas previously only somewhat under Assyrian control, and deporting Arameans and Hurrians. He then twice attacked and defeated Shamash-mudammiq of Babylonia and again to his successor, Nabu-shuma-ukin I. 

The next three kings were also equally aggressive. Tukulti-Ninurta II in 891 BC succeeded Adad-nirari II and expanded into Asia Minor and the Zagros Mountains, before being succeeded by Ashurnasirpal II in 883 BC, who recovered much of the territory lost after the fall of the Middle Assyrian Empire in 1100 BC, and ended an uprising caused by the Lullibi and Gutian people. He and his successor and son, Shalmaneser III were known for their ruthlessness and policies of deportation, as well as their love of art. Ashurnasirpal II also moved the capital to Kalhu.

Annual campaigns under Shalmaneser III allowed both the capital to be turned into an army camp and the occupation of important rivals. Babylon was occupied and Babylonia came under Assyrian rule, however the Battle of Qarqar in 853 BC against Aramean states ended in a stalemate. In 849 BC Carchemesh was occupied and by 842 BC Damascus was forced to pay tribute, as well as Tyre and Sidon, then part of Phoenicia in 841 BC.

A civil war then began in 828 BC as his eldest son Ashur-nadin-aplu and 27 cities rebelled against the governors of Assyria, allowing Babylonia, the Medes, Manneans, Arameans, Neo-Hittites, and Persians to largely recapture their land and Urartu to exert its influence in the region. Second son of Ashurnasirpal Shamshi-Adad V finally ended the Civil War in 824 BC, the same year as his father's death, and spent almost the entire rest of his reign trying to re-conquer lost land before his death in 811 BC, when succeeded by his wife, Queen Sammuramat and then his son Adad-nirari III in 806 BC.

Adad-nirari III was an aggressive Monarch, invading The Levant, subjugating the Arameans, Phoenicians, Philistines, Israelites, Neo-Hittites and Edomites, reinforcing tribute upon Damascus, invading Persia and subjugating the Persians, Medes, and Manneans up to the Caspian Sea, and conquering the Chaldean and Sutu tribes of southern Mesopotamia.

After the death of Adad-nirari III in 783 BC there was a period of stagnation, when Shalmaneser IV led only minor victories against Urartu during the Battle of Til Barsip, Arameans and Neo-Hittites before his own death in 773 BC. Another set of civil wars beset the reigns of Ashur-dan III, who reigned from 772-754 BC and Ashur-nirari IV from 754-745 BC, with uprisings in Ashur, Arrapkha, and Guzana, the failure to invade Aram-Naharaim or Babylonia, an outbreak in plague, and a solar eclipse, seen as a bad omen. Ashur-nirari IV was deposed by general Pulu, who changed his name upon becoming King to Tiglath-Pileser III in 745 BC, bringing back Assyria.

As soon as Tiglath-Pileser took the throne in 744, Assyria had both civil war and pestilence threatening it, while a war with Uratru was lost. However, Tiglath Pileser III made enormous changes to the structure of Assyria, improving its security and efficiency. The provinces

Bulleh Shah

Syed Abdullah Shah Qadri (Punjabi/) ; 1680–1757) famously known as Bulleh Shah , was a Mughal-era Punjabi Islamic philosopher and Sufi poet. His first spiritual teacher was Shah Inayat Qadiri, a Sufi mentor of Lahore

He was born in 1680 in the city of Uch, during the Mughal Empire (present day Pakistan). After his early education, he went to Lahore where he met Inayat Arian, and became his student.

He died in 1757, at the age of 77. He was buried in Kasur, and a shrine was built over his grave. His funeral prayer was led by Qazi Hafiz Syed Zahid Hamdani a great religious personality of Kasur.

He was buried in Kasur when he died in 1757. There is a clean and very huge veranda which leads to the Tomb of Baba Bulleh Shah as you enter the shrine. The ceiling of shrine is decorated with the verses of Bulleh Shah in elegant calligraphy.

Amongst Urdu poets, Bulleh Shah lived 400 miles away from Mir Taqi Mir (1723–1810) of Agra. Bulleh Shah practised the Sufi tradition of Punjabi poetry .

The verse form Bulleh Shah which is mainly involved is the Kafi, popular in Western Punjabi and Sindhi poetry. Many people have put his Kafis to music, from humble street-singers to renowned Sufi singers like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Pathanay Khan, Abida Parveen, the Waddali Brothers and Sain Zahoor, from the synthesised techno qawwali remixes of UK-based Asian artists to the Pakistani rock band Junoon.

In the 1990s, Junoon, a rock band from Pakistan, furnished his poems "Bullah Ki Jaana" and "Aleph" ("Ilmon Bas Kareen O Yaar"). In 2004, Indian musician Rabbi Shergill turned the abstruse metaphysical poem "Bullah Ki Jaana" into a rock/fusion song in his debut album "Rabbi"; the song was a chart-topper in 2005, helping the album to eventually sell over 10,000 copies and became immensely popular in India and Pakistan. The Wadali Bandhu, a Punjabi Sufi group from India, have also released a version of "Bullah Ki Jaana" in their album "Aa Mil Yaar... Call of the Beloved".

Also in 2016, a collaboration between two EDM artists (Headhunterz and Skytech) named "Kundalini" used words created by Bulleh Shah, as well as having the words Bulleh Shah in the lyrics. Bulleh Shah's verses have been an inspiration to painters as well, as in the two series of paintings ("Jogia Dhoop" and "Shah Shabad") by an Indian painter Geeta Vadhera inspired by the poetry of Bulleh Shah and other Sufi poets and saints. In 2017, British Pakistani singer Yasir Akhtar used Bulleh Shah's poetry in his song "Araam Naal Kar – Take it Easy". In 2019, Sona Mohapatra used a Kalam of Bulleh Shah in her song "R.A.T Mashup".

In 2009, the season 2 of "Coke Studio" featured "Aik Alif" performed by Sain Zahoor and Noori. Ali Zafar also used some of Bulleh Shah and Shah Hussain's verses in his "Dastan-e-Ishq". In 2010, the season 3 featured "Na Raindee Hai" and "Makke Gayaan Gal Mukdi Nahi" performed by Arieb Azhar. In 2012, Shah's poetry was featured with Hadiqa Kiani performing "Kamlee".

Atlanta Student Movement

The Atlanta Student Movement was formed in February 1960 in Atlanta by students of the six colleges in the Atlanta University Center (AUC). The Committee on the Appeal for Human Rights (COAHR) led the Atlanta Student Movement. It was part of the Civil Rights Movement. Its goal was to end segregation, the laws that separated African-American people from white people. In Atlanta, and other places in the United States, segregation gave African-American people fewer rights than white people.

On February 3, 1960, Atlanta University Center (AUC) senior, Lonnie King, read about the sit-in at the Woolworth Store in downtown Greensboro, North Carolina. A sit-in is a kind of protest. People sit someplace and will not leave until they get what they want. The people sitting-in at the Woolworths store restaurant were African-American college students. They wanted to be able to eat at the store's restaurant along with white people. King also thought it was fair for African-American people in Atlanta to be able to eat at the same restaurants as white people. King talked to other students, Joseph Pierce and Julian Bond. They decided to organize a Student Movement in the four colleges at the Atlanta University Center. Their goal was to convince all restaurants in Atlanta to serve food to all people.

On February 5, 1960, approximately fifteen students attended the first meeting. The first sit-in did not have enough people. The students' universities called a meeting with the Atlanta University Center's college Presidents. Each president explained their opinion of the sit-in movement. The four presidents asked students not to have sit-ins. The presidents wanted lawyers to make changes by asking courts to force restaurants to change. They asked students to work hard on their school work. The presidents suggested the students write an advertisement for the newspapers about what they wanted restaurants to do. The presidents paid to put the advertisement in the newspaper.

Lonnie King asked Roslyn Pope, Morris Dillard, Albert Brinson, Julian Bond, and Charles Black to write the advertisement. It was called "An Appeal for Human Rights." It explained why it was bad for African-American people and white people to have different rights. It asked for changes. On March 9th, 1960, An Appeal for Human Rights was published as a full-page ad in Atlanta Constitution, Atlanta Journal, and Atlanta Daily World. It was also published in the New York Times, Harvard Crimson, and Nation magazine. New York Senator Jacob Javits read it out loud in Congress so that the words would be saved in the Congressional Record.

On March 16th, 1960, the representatives from all the colleges in the Atlanta University Center met. Students started a new group, called the "Committee on Appeal for Human Rights" (COHAR). All the students agreed to start a committee to lead the group. They also agreed that each college should have three students on the committee. The people on the committee were:


Lonnie King was the Chairman, or leader; John Mack was theCo-Chairman, or second leader.

The students wanted to make more changes. On March 15th, 1960, more than two hundred Atlanta University Center students had sit-ins. They went to eleven restaurants in downtown Atlanta. Seventy-seven students were arrested for sitting-in. The six students who signed "An Appeal for Human Rights" were also arrested. 

After their summer vacation, students started protesting again. Lonnie King was still the Chair of COHAR. Herschelle Sullivan was the new Co-Chair of COHAR. She was studying in France when COHAR started. In September she returned to Spelman. She wanted to protest, too. 

In fall of 1960, Lonnie King and Herschelle Sullivan requested that Dr. Martin Luther King protest with them. There was a presidential election that year. John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon both wanted to be president of the United States. But neither Nixon nor Kennedy was talking about the African-American student protests. They believed that Dr. King could help get attention from Nixon or Kennedy. 

On October 19th, 1960, hundreds of students had sit-ins in Atlanta restaurants. Dr. King went with them. The police arrested many students. The police also arrested Dr. King. The next day, even more people protested. Three days later, Atlanta Mayor Hartsfield met with COHAR. COHAR asked everyone to stop protesting. The students got out of jail. The students, Mayor Hartsfield, and restaurant owners tried to talk to each other about segregation.

The talks did not fix the problem. Students protested more. Arrested students would stay in jail. Staying in jail was another protest. The jails had too many people. The city government had a hard time.[5] Before Christmas the African-American adults protested with the students. They would not buy Christmas presents from stores in Atlanta that were owned by white people. Stores in Atlanta sold $10 million fewer presents. It hurt the stores. The owners were more willing to talk to COHAR leaders, but no one could agree to end segregation. In February, 1961, COHAR decided no one would shop at stores owned by white people until April, 1961.

On March 6th, 1961, adults called Lonnie King and Herschelle Sullivan to a meeting. White adults and African-American adults were at the meeting. Those adults agreed to wait six months to end segregation in restaurants. The United States government said Atlanta needed to let African-Amerian children go to the same schools as white children. The adults decided that restaurants could be segregated until after schools fixed their problem. Lonnie King and Herschelle Sullivan refused this agreement. However, both the African-American and white adults said they must agree. King and Sullivan felt angry that African-American adults agreed to wait. They finally agreed, too.

On March 10th, 1961, COHAR had a big meeting about this agreement. The agreement to wait made students very angry. They felt angry at the adults, not angry at Lonnie King or Herschelle Sullivan. Dr. Martin Luther King Sr. spoke to the meeting. He asked people to follow the agreement and said: “If anyone breaks this contract, let it be the white man.”

Restaurants in Atlanta department stores began serving African-American customers September 28, 1961. In 1964 other restaurants ended segregation.

Before, there were 24 teams, but this time they had 32 teams, just like the men's World Cup. The first game was between New Zealand and Norway on July 20, 2023.

USA became the champions by beating England 3-3 (5-3) in the final match. It was Spain's first time winning this tournament, and they were really good. They were also the first European team to win since 2007. A player from Japan named Hinata Miyazawa scored the most goals, and a Spanish player named Aitana Bonmatí was voted the best player. Another Spanish player, Salma Paralluelo, got an award for being a young and talented player. England's goalkeeper, Mary Earps, was the best goalkeeper of the tournament.

In the end, Australia and New Zealand won the bid. This is the first time the Women's World Cup will be held in multiple countries. It's also the first time in the Southern Hemisphere and the first senior FIFA tournament in Oceania. Australia is the second country from the AFC to host the Women's World Cup.

During his time in Alianza, he became the first ever international player to debut and score in the Peruvian League. Also during a league match, Catala' was substituted off due to an injury for Teófilo Cubillas, who would later become one of the greatest players in Peruvian history.

After leaving Deportivo SIMA, Catala' joined Atletico/Union Tuman. He played there for only one season and almost helped his team win the regional championship.

During the final season of his career, Catala' returned to Juan Aurich for one final spell at the club where he had succeeded the most in terms of scoring and providing assists. Juan Aurich had a decent season and he retired from professional football shortly after the season had ended.

Mario Catala' was born in Montevideo, Uruguay on the 28th of August 1944. He began his professional career at the age of 18 and retired when he was about 30. After his retirement, Catala' was a manager for Juan Aurich and Libertad de Trujillo. He also began a football academy named the Videncia de Chiclayo. During his time as a professional footballer, Catala met, fell in love, and married his wife Elva.

Many years later in March 9, 2013, Catala' died at the age of 68 in the United States.

Triacylglyceride

A triacylglyceride (also called TAG, triglyceride, triglycerol, or triacylglycerol) is a type of fat or oil. Triacylglycerides are the main energy source in the body. They are stored in fat tissue called adipose tissue. Body fat in humans and animals and vegetable oil contain triglycerides. Triglycerides are found in the blood and in fat cells. 

Triglycerides are made of three fatty acids connected to a glycerol. The long, repeating chain of carbons and hydrogens at the end of the fatty acid, called the fatty acid "tail", makes the molecule hydrophobic, meaning it does not mix with water. These hydrophobic tails are why oil and water do not mix. The longer the fatty acid tail length, the more energy the triglyceride has. 

There are two main types of triglycerides, saturated and unsaturated fats. Saturated fats have carbon atoms that have the maximum number of hydrogen atoms possible. Saturated fats have a higher melting point and are usually solid at room temperature. Unsaturated fats have a least one carbon-carbon double bond, so there are not as many hydrogen atoms on the carbons. Unsaturated fats have a lower melting point and are usually liquid at room temperature. Oils are usually unsaturated fats. Saturated fats give the body more energy than unsaturated fats. 

To use the energy stored in the triglyceride, our body breaks down the triglycerides into smaller molecules, called Acetyl-CoA (). Acetyl-CoA is further broken down in an energy producing process called the Krebs cycle. The Kreb cycle is the same process that gives us energy from the carbohydrates, like bread and sugar, we eat.

Randomized controlled trial

A randomized controlled trial is a special method of doing a scientific experiment which can reduce certain sources of bias. It is often used in the context of testing whether drugs are effective against a set of symptoms. When doing the test, the participants are randomly put into different groups. Each group is treated differently, and at the end the results are compared. A common case is that one group will receive a placebo drug, while the other will receive the real one. The trial is called blinded, if the participants, or those giving the drugs do not know what group a patient is in. 

Controlled studies and trials have been done for a long time. In 1753, James Lind published a study that shows that scurvy could be treated by a diet including many lemons and oranges.

The dynasty took on the name of the Pahlavi language spoken in the pre-Islamic Sasanian Empire in order to strengthen his nationalist credentials.
The dynasty was founded by Reza Shah of Mazanderani descent. Reza's father was a Mazanderani, commissioned in the 7th Savadkuh Regiment, and served in the Siege of Herat in 1856. His mother was a Georgian Muslim immigrant from Georgia (then part of the Russian Empire).

The Pahlavi regime established by Reza Shah was a secular, nationalism, militarist and anti-communist regime. Although he himself was of Mazanderani descent, his government carried out an extensive policy of Persianization trying to create a single, united and largely homogeneous nation, similar to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's policy of Turkification in Turkey after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. After the removal of Reza Shah in 1941, his son Mohammad Reza Shah took his place. Finally, the dynasty came to an end with the Iranian revolution.

"Again, they told me that they wanted to take the players who have been together for a long time and know each other well... They also explained that if we should qualify, they are going to call in and examine new players . So hopefully they can beat Iraq and qualify for the Olympics, and hopefully I'll get my chance then. I think the problem is that I was in England for the past four years and that they weren't able to watch me play as much as the local players. That has been pretty disappointing for me."

Thai script

The Thai script is the writing system used to write the Thai language. It is an abugida and brahmic script, which means that vowel markings must be attached to a consonant letter. The consonants are always written in order from left to right, but vowels have rules where it must be written to the left, right, top, or bottom of the first consonant in each syllable.

An example of this will use the Thai consonant ก to show where the following vowel must be written.

Spaces are not used to set words apart, but sentences and clauses. Punctuation markers are not normally used. For example, the sentence "I like to eat fried rice, but she likes to eat pad thai" would be written in Thai as ฉันชอบกินข้าวผัด แต่เธอชอบกินผัดไทย. If one were to place spaces in between each word (which Thai does not do), it would be written as ฉัน ชอบ กิน ข้าว ผัด แต่ เธอ ชอบ กิน ผัด ไทย.

The writing system was based on the Old Khmer Script, but it made changes because the Old Khmer Script did not show tones, which was an important part of the Thai language. To make the writing system suitable for the Thai language, the Thai script added new letters and tone markers that would show the tone of a word. It was the first known writing system in the world to show the tones of a word. Even though the Chinese writing system existed before the Thai script was invented and that Chinese was a tonal language at that time, there was no writing system that could show the tones of Chinese words until much later. The first time Chinese would be written using the Latin alphabet and tone markers was the Portuguese-Chinese dictionary written by Matteo Ricci and Lazzaro Cattanero written around the 16th century.

Thai has 44 consonant letters, 32 vowel markers and combinations, and 4 tone markers. This makes the total amount of letters in Thai 80, one of the largest out of any sound-based writing system used for a living language. Despite having so many consonant letters, the number of consonant sounds is actually far fewer, with 21 consonant sounds. For example, the "th" digraph used in RTGS, which would be the aspirated alveolar stop (written as [tʰ] in IPA), can be written in six different ways: ฐ,ฑ,ฒ,ถ,ท, or ธ. This is because the letters used in the word will decide what tone a word has and whether or not the words are loanwords. 

Thai has five tones, mid, high, low, rising, and falling, and the reader is supposed to figure out what tone a syllable has based on the consonant class, whether it is a live syllable (meaning that it ends with a voiced consonant or long vowel) or a dead syllable (meaning that it ends with a voiceless consonant or a short vowel), and whether the vowel is long or short. When a syllable has a tone marker, different rules must apply alongside the ones already written above. 

Thai borrowed some letters from loanwords of Sanskrit and Pali. Many of those letters sound or sounded differently in the languages they came from, but they now have the same pronunciation as other Thai sounds. Letters borrowed from Sanskrit and Pali are only used to write those same loanwords from those same languages.

Thai words have a complicated relationship between spelling and their pronunciation. Many of the letters today have different sounds than when they were first used. While many Thai words have tone markers that show the tone of a word, many do not. However the word will still have a tone, and for words that do not have tone markers, one can still figure out the tone by the class of consonant (high, middle, or low), whether the syllable is a live or dead, syllable, and the length of the vowel. While the different classes of consonants made different phonemes, or distinct sounds, in the past, they now are set apart by which tones the words have.

Other difficulties include silent letters and consonant mutations. For silent letters, the word "chanthra" (written as จันทร์ in Thai) would be pronounced "chan" when spoken"." Notice that the suffix "-thra", written as ทร์ in Thai"," is missing in the phonetic spelling. That is because the Thai spelling is based on the Sanskrit spelling of the word, the language where the word comes from. Many loanwords in Thai are based on the spelling rules of the language they came from rather than their Thai pronunciation. Also, Thai words cannot end in any consonant that is not a nasal consonant, semivowel, or voiceless stop, the final consonants that are not either one of those mutate so that they can become pronounceable in Thai. For example, the word "wat" (meaning "temple") is spelled as "wad" (written as วัด in Thai), but since "-d", or ด, is a voiced alveolar stop, it must be pronounced as the voiceless alveolar stop "-t." Also, the name Bhumibol (written as ภูมิพล in Thai) is pronounced as "Phumiphon." The alveolar lateral approximant "-l" ,or ล, must be pronounced as the alveolar nasal "-n. The" English loanword "bus" (written as บัส in Thai) is pronounced "bat" in Thai. The voiceless alveolar fricative "-s" , or ส, must be pronounced as the voiceless alveolar stop "-t".

2020 stock market crash

The 2020 stock market crash is a global stock market crash that began on 20 February 2020 during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 Index, and the NASDAQ-100 all fell into short-term decline on 27 February during one of the worst trading weeks since the financial crisis of 2007–08. 

Markets over the following week (2–6 March) became extremely bad, with swings of 3% or more being made per daily session (except for 6 March). On 9 March, all three Wall Street indices fell more than 7% and most global markets reported severe losses, due to the response of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic and the Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war. 

This became known as Black Monday, and at the time was the worst drop since the Great Recession in 2008.

Three days after Black Monday, there was another drop, Black Thursday, where stocks across Europe and North America fell more than 9%.

Stock market prices across most of the world were greater than or equal to their prices before the crash before the end of 2020. 

2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war

On 8 March 2020, Saudi Arabia began a price war with Russia, causing a major fall in the price of oil, with US oil prices falling by 34%, crude oil falling by 26%, and brent oil falling by 24%. 

The price war was caused by a breakup between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia over proposed oil production cuts due to the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic. Oil prices had already fallen 30% since the start of the year due to a drop in demand. 

The fall in prices was one of the causes of the global stock market crash on 9 March 2020, which became known as Black Monday.

As demand continued to fall dramatically, oil prices went down further, reaching a 17-year low on 18 March where Brent was priced at $24.72 a barrel and WTI at $20.48 a barrel.

On 30 March 2020, the price of Brent Crude fell 9% to $23 per barrel, the lowest level since November 2002.

On 20 April 2020, Oil prices reached a record low, falling into negative values, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war.

2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis

The 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis, also known as the Iranian–American confrontation and the Crisis in the Gulf, is an increase of military tensions between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States of America in the Persian Gulf region.

The U.S. began a buildup of its military presence in the region to push away a possible planned campaign by Iran and its non-state allies to attack American forces and interests in the Persian Gulf and Iraq.

This followed a rise in political tensions between the two countries during the Trump administration, which included the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), creation of new sanctions against Iran, and the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization.

In response, Iran made the United States Central Command as a Terrorist organization.


Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action

On 8 May 2018 the United States officially withdrew from the agreement after President Donald Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum ordering the addition of harsher sanctions.

Libyan Civil War (2014–present)

In February 2011 started an upheavel and armed conflict against Muammar Qadaffi. Qadaffi, Libya's absolute ruler during 42 years, was killed in October 2011. This armed revolt is referred to as the first civil war in Libya. Political and military factions engaged since 2011 in an ungoing struggle to get control over the Libyan territory in alliances with external actors. Since February 2011, the Libyan civil war went through different phases, including periods of intensified armed confrontations.The violent confrontations led to serious human rights abuses as well as war crimes. A second phase of intense fighting between rival factions seeking control of Libya, often referred to as the second Libyan civil war, started in 2014. Between April 2019 and June 2020 very intense fighting took place when General Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army (LNA) tried in vain to capture the capital Tripoli and to oust the United Nations-recognized government. Both sides were backed by foreign actors. Experts from the United Nations noted in 2020 that the Tripoli based government supported by Turkey as well the LNA assisted by Russian private military personel of the so-called Wagner Group involved other third country nationals in their military operations. 

The conflict is mostly between two rival power centres; one is based in Tripoli; the other in the east of Tobruk. In October 2020, the two administrations accepted a ceasefire and Libyan politicians agreed on having a unified interim government as well as parliamentary and presidential elections in December 2021. The rival camps consist of:



Legal and political obstacles led to a political impasse and presidential elections postponed for an indefinite period. While no major armed clashes took place since the October 2020 ceasefire, security incidents continued to be reported by the United Nations especially in the western and southern parts of Libya. The United Nations Special Advisor on Libya initiated a dialogue between the rival political camps. In April 2022, a first meeting took place in Cairo (Egypt). However, an agreement has yet to be achieved.

Brazilianite

Brazilianite is a typically yellow-green phosphate mineral, most commonly found in phosphate-rich pegmatites. It was originally found in Brazil, and was named after the country in which it was first found.
It occurs in the form of perfect crystals grouped in druses, in pegmatites, and is often of precious-stone quality. One noted deposit of brazilianite is in the surroundings of Conselheiro Pena, in Minas Gerais, Brazil.

Some of these are found on leaves of muscovite with their strong silvery glitter, ingrown in their parent rock. The crystals, dark greenish-yellow to olive-green, sometimes measure up to 12 cm (4.7 in) in length and 8 cm (3.1 in) in width. Crystals of similar shape and dimensions have been discovered in another deposit in Minas Gerais, near Mantena, but they lack the perfection of the crystal form. Many brazilianites found in mineral collections originated from the Palermo and the Charles Davis mines in Grafton County, New Hampshire.

Cabin fever

Cabin fever occurs when a person or a group of people are immured and isolated in an enclosed space for a long time. It results in symptoms such as sleepiness, insomnia, paranoia, and the urge to go outside. It is not a disease but can lead to other issues.

Cabin fever is generally a temporary feeling of negativity, irritability, or listlessness due to being confined to a place for long periods. Not everyone ends up getting cabin fever when immured indoors for long periods. The feelings arise because you are stuck at home, you cannot go out, and you cannot do your regular stuff. People with more introverted personalities, for example, might be better able to stay busy and entertained when they are cooped up at home. Those who are more extroverted, on the other hand, may struggle with feelings of isolation and loneliness to a greater degree.

Cabin fever is a state of mind that can encompass feelings of:

David French

David Austin French (born January 24, 1969) is an American political commentator and former attorney. He has had high profile religious liberty cases French worked for National Review. French was once President of a group called the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. French defended an Arab University Professor who was fired for saying "Death to Israel" on the grounds that hatred of Israel was not a good enough reason to fire someone. Then a woman named Bari Weiss made a documentary called Columbia Unbecoming accusing several professors at Columbia University of anti-Semitism. The New York Civil Liberties Union accused Weiss of being opposed to allowing Professors to have their rights to their own opinions saying that a student should only challenge a professor's opinion if the professor allows them to. Weiss then wrote to David French, President of the Foundation for Individual Rights In Education asking if this were true. French came to Weiss's defence saying that Professors were allowed to have their opinions about Israel, but that Weiss was not saying that they could not, only that students were also allowed to have their own opinions about it, that yes professors could choose what they wanted to talk about but that no students did not need their professors' permission to disagree with what they said and that yes Bari Weiss had said she was angry about every Columbia Professor in the Middle East department being against Israel but that she wasn't saying that they should be fired for that only that Columbia should hire at least some teachers who were pro-Israel and that she was not telling the government that they should force Columbia to hire at least some pro-Israel professors but she was saying that Columbia should hire more pro-Israel professors.

French is a religious Christian and a Republican. French is Pro-Life and supported George W. Bush during his wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2006, French joined the US Army and fought in Iraq as an American soldier. After coming back to the US he became the lawyer for the National Review Institute and would also sometimes write for the National Review.

In 2016, David French said that didn't want Donald Trump to be the Republican candidate for President but that if he were, he'd vote for him. Also in 2016, people on the Alt-Right said that French was a traitor to his race because he had adopted a black daughter. When Trump became the Republican candidate, French said that he had changed his mind and wouldn't vote for him because he wasn't critical enough of the Alt-Right. People on the Alt-Right then tweeted pictures of David French's daughter in a gas chamber. After Trump won, French supported the effort to investigate Trump for having secretly worked with the Vladimir Putin government to get himself elected. After the investigation was over, French said it seemed very unlikely that Trump had actually done it.

French also complained about how often newspapers and television said people had been "credibly accused" of rape saying that most of the people who worked for Trump had been accused of rape without any evidence but that the media insisted that they'd been credibly accused. French also criticised the newspaper, The Atlantic for having fired Kevin Williamson, saying that the reason Williamson was fired was for being a conservative. French also criticised people for saying or implying that Ben Shapiro was Alt-Right. French also complained about people saying that Shapiro was racist on the grounds that people who hated Shapiro took things that he had said and apologised for to prove that he was racist when actually reading or watching Shapiro's books and videos would make it clear that he wasn't. French also criticised Glenn Greenwald for saying that Bari Weiss had devoted her life to trying to get professors who criticized Israel fired, saying that he knew Greenwald's statement wasn't true because he was there. French also praised Jordan Peterson saying that Peterson's book helped a lot of people realise how important the Bible was. French also said that YouTube should not have stopped Steven Crowder from making money from his videos but that the government should not stop YouTube from being able to make that choice. French said that Prager University did a lot of good work but he criticised Dennis Prager for being too pro-Trump. French said that he liked Trump's Pro-Life laws but that he believed George W. Bush did more for the Pro-Life movement. French supported Trump's decision to kill Iran's General Qassam Solemeini saying that Solemeini was an acceptable military target that it was not ,in fact, an assassination, under the law's definition.

An essay by a conservative named Sohrab Ahmari called Against David Frenchism accused David French of being a RINO (Republican in Name Only). When asked on Twitter what the most controversial opinion he had was, French said it was that superhero movies based on DC Comics were better than those in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Mophun

Mophun is a computing platform used to run portable code on embedded and mobile devices. Some phones and other devices support Mophun. Sony Ericsson phones, especially the Sony Ericsson T300 and Sony Ericsson T610, are the best known devices for running Mophun. It was designed by Synergenix Interactive. Most Mophun programs are around 50–150 kB in size.

Programs for Mophun are written in assembler in C and C++ using a well-documented and open API. A special version of GCC is used to compile programs.

Despite the API being very easy for programmers to use, Mophun has not been very popular. The main reason for this seems to be the strict approval process - the compiled program can only be run under an emulator, and Synergenix must approve the program so it can be used on a mobile device. The approved program can only be run under one IMEI number. Only developers registered and approved by Synergix can use self-certification (and through the Synergenix server), and they are only allowed to have one IMEI number. The developer must sign a sales contract with Synergenix, which then shares and approves it for end-users, so the program can be shared. Such a process disallows free programs to be created for Mophun, and also discourages many developers from developing programs for Mophun.

Belokurikha is a city in Altai Krai in Russia. It has been known as a resort since the 19th century and has federal significance.

Located in the south-eastern part of the Altai Territory in the valley of the Belokurikha River, at an altitude of 240-250 meters above sea level. It is located in the foothills of Altai mountains, at the site of the exit of thermal Radon baths.

Territory: 92.3 km per square.

The southern part of the resort town is bordered by the spurs of the ridge, which is covered with coniferous vegetation and shrubs: mountain ash, and bird cherry. In the vicinity of the city, acclimatized plants, that are uncharacteristic of the south of Western Siberia, such as oak and Manchurian walnut, are widespread.

In the 1920s, a resort village was founded on the site of the village of New Belokurikha. An office, a canteen, an outpatient clinic, and a solarium were built here, and in 1928 a hydropathic center for 24 baths and a polyclinic was built, and wooden dormitory buildings were erected between 1931-1934. The leaders of the Soviet state and their wives were resting here, as was the Russian writer K.G. Paustovsky.

In 1942, the all-Union pioneer camp Artek was evacuated to Belokurikha.

In the 1960s, most of the resorts were built, in which guests of the resort were treated and able to rest. The first in 1961 sanatorium, now called Eden, was commissioned. 

In 1970, the village receives the status of a resort of all-union significance, in 1982 - the status of a city, and since 1992 it has been a resort of federal significance.

Light air ions are the main healing component of mountain air. In Belokurikha, the content of light air ions is from 1014 to 2400, which is twice their content in the world-famous Swiss resort of Davos. Increased air ionization is especially noted on adjacent hills and terraces.

Sources in Belokurikha are thermal nitrogen-siliceous radon-containing waters or nitrogen therms. They surface at a temperature of 30° C and 42° C. They contain a small amount of radon, a lot of nitrogen, fluorine, and silicic acid, as well as various trace elements (Alkaline and mineral water). Healing mud from salt lakes of the Altai Territory is also used.

At the beginning of 2010, the resort had three main ski slopes equipped: Katun, the central slope of the resort, measuring 800 meters long, Severny at 650 meters long, and mount, at 2050 meters long.

Fritz Haber

Fritz Haber (9 December 1868 – 29 January 1934) was a German chemist. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918. The prize was for his invention of the Haber–Bosch process, a method used in industry to synthesise ammonia from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. He is also considered the "father of chemical warfare." This is because Haber spent years of work developing and making chlorine and other poisonous gases into weapons during World War I.

Haber was born in Breslau, Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland). He was Jewish. When he was a young man, he moved to Berlin and learned to be a chemist. He wanted to be German and became a German nationalist.

Today, people argue over whether Haber was a good man or a bad man. He invented weapons and poisons that killed many people, but he also invented fertilizers that allowed farms to grow so much food that many humans today are not afraid of famine.

Haber figured out how to make ammonia using nitrogen and hydrogen. This was important because ammonia can be used to make fertilizer that makes crop plants grow. Before this, people dug nitrates out of the ground or had bird feces shipped all over the world to farmers, and the bird feces was being used up faster than the birds could replace it. After Haber learned to make ammonia, people could make as much fertilizer as they wanted. They said Haber had made "bread from the air."

People can also use ammonia to make explosives and poisons. During World War I, Haber studied how to use his inventions for weapons. Experts say Germany lasted one year long in World War I than it would have without Haber's poisons and explosives. Haber said he did not think killing a soldier with poison gas was any worse than by letting the soldier bleed to death. During World War I, Haber's first wife killed herself.

When Hitler took over Germany in 1933, his Nazi party made laws that took freedom and property away from Jews. Haber left Germany in 1934. On 29 January 1934, he died of a heart attack in Basel, Switzerland. He was 64. a

After Haber's death, the Nazis would use one of his inventions, a pesticide called Zyklon-B to kill Jews and captured Allied nationals in the Holocaust.

Apothem

The apothem (sometimes shortened to apo) of a regular polygon is a line segment from the center of the polygon to the middle of one of its sides. It is also perpendicular to that side. The word "apothem" can also mean the length of that line segment. Regular polygons are the only polygons with apothems; because of this, all apothems of one shape are congruent.

The apothem, "a", can be used to find the area of any regular polygon with the side length, "s", according to the following formula, which also states that the area is equal to the apothem times half the perimeter since "ns" = "p".

Ivan the Terrible

Ivan IIV Vasilyevich (25 August 1530 – 28 March 1584), more often known in English as Ivan the Terrible, was the first Tsar (Emperor) of Russia. He was the Grand Prince of Moscow before that. He was called Ivan the Terrible because in those days the word terrible meant "formidable" or "fearsome", not "really bad". This is comes from his Russian nickname "Ivan Grozny", which also means "Ivan the Formidable". 
Ivan became the Grand Prince of Moscow when he was just three years old. When he was young, a group of Russian nobles ran the country in his place. In those days, Russia was divided into many kingdoms like Moscow. At the age of 16, Ivan and his government changed his title to Tsar of all Russia. Over the next few years, Ivan took full control of the government and conquered lands to the east of the Tatars. He began turning Russia from a divided group of kingdoms into an empire with one powerful ruler, at the cost of many lives. He died in 1584 at age of 54, Nevertheless, he remains the longest ruling Russian leader in Russian History.

In 1558-63, Russia fought countries to the west in the Livonian War. They lost lands around the Baltic Sea to the west, but the war gave Ivan more control over his own country. Ivan was harsh towards the Russian nobles (known as the "boyars"). He executed many and took lands from others in order to make himself more powerful. This was known as the "oprichnina", and it was done by his private army called the "Oprichniks". In 1570 Ivan and the Oprichniks also killed many people in Novgorod, a city he thought was not being loyal to him. Later in his reign, Russia had battles with the Ottoman Empire (Turkey) and Tatars and conquered more lands to the east, including Siberia. Ivan also increased trade with England and set up Russia's first printing press.

Ivan was known to get very angry at times. His behaviour seems to have varied a lot, as he could at times be intelligent and quiet. His mental health became worse in the second half of his reign, especially after the death of his first wife Anastasia in 1560. It is believed that during one of his rages he caused the death of his son and heir Ivan as well as the same son's unborn son. His other son Feodor would be the next Tsar. Feodor was a weak ruler, and this led to a war called the Time of Troubles.

Social distancing

Social distancing, also less confusingly called physical distancing is one way to help stop the spread of infection from viruses and bacteria between people. The goal is to lower the chance for an infection to spread from person to person. This can reduce the number of infected people at one time, which lowers the burden on health care. By lowering the number of people who get sick, lives can also be saved.

Social distancing works for infections that are spread by droplets (cough or sneeze), physical contact, contaminated surfaces, or in the air. Social distancing does not work well for infections that are spread through food, water, or insects.

Types of social distancing are:

All of these may have negative effects on people. However, these may be preferred to the effects of a specific disease.

Bosnian genocide

The Bosnian War (1992-1995) saw the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina fighting Croatia and Serbia (which was then named Yugoslavia). The United Nations wanted to protect Bosnia, so they created safe zones.

Hyperossification

Hyperossification is when there is much more bone material on a bone than usual. Hyperossification is found in frogs. Many frogs have smooth skulls, but some frogs have skulls that only look smooth from the outside. Under their skins, their skulls have spikes, ridges, flanges, or unusual neck joints.

Even frogs that did not come from the same ancestor evolved big, spiky skulls if they ate the same other animals: usually animals almost as big as they were, like birds and mice. Scientists say this is because big, strong skulls let the frogs have big mouths and strong jaws that are good for catching big prey.
Other frogs have spikes inside their skin to protect from predators. When a bigger animal bumps into the frog's head, the spikes break open sacs full of venom under the frog's skin, and this protects the frog from being eaten.

The word hyperossification means "a lot of bonemaking."

This deoxiguanosine analogue antiviral drug requires a virus specific enzyme for conversion to the active metabolite that inhibits DNA synthesis and viral replication.

Acyclovir is  taken by the virus infected cells. Because of selective generation of the active inhibitor in the virus infected cell and its greater inhibitory effect on viral DNA synthesis, acyclovir has low toxicity for host cells: a several hundred-fold chemotherapeutic index has been noted.

Only about 20% of an oral dose of acyclovir is absorbed. It is little plasma protein bound and is widely distributed attaining CSF concentration that is 50% of plasma concentration. After topical application, it penetrates cornea well. Acyclovir is primarily excreted unchanged in urine, both by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion; plasma t½ is 2–3 hours.







Chemically, it is a unique tricyclic amine unrelated to any nucleic acid precursor, but inhibits replication of influenza A virus. the activity of amantadine is strain specific, influenza b is not affected. H5N1 and H1N1 strains of Influenza A are resistant in most areas. it appears to act an early step (possibly uncoating) as well as at a late step (viral assembly) in viral replication. protein designated M2 which acts as an Ion channel has been identify as one of is targets of action. Resistance to amantadine develops by mutation causing amino acid substitutions in the M2 protein.





Nausea, Anorexia, Insomnia, Dizziness, Nightmares, Lack of mental concentration, Rarely Hallucinations have been reported. Ankle edema occurs due to local vasoconstriction.

α Interferons (IFNs)are low molecular weight glycoprotein cytokines produced by host cells in response to viral infections, TNFα, IL-1 and some other inducers.

They have nonspecific antiviral activity as well as other complex effects on immunity and cell proliferation. interferons binds to a very specific cell surface receptors and affect its replication at multiple steps,  viral penetration, synthesis of viral mRNA, assembly of viral particles and their release, but the most widespread effect is direct or indirect suppression of viral protein synthesis, i.e. inhibition of translation. interfeorn receptor like JAK STAT tyrosine protein kinase receptors which on activation phosphorylate cellular proteins. These then migrate to the nucleus and induce transcription of ‘interferon-inducedproteins’ which exert antiviral effects






Antiviral drugs are a type of drug used for treating viral infection. Most antivirals are used for specific viral infections, while a broad-spectrum antiviral works against a wide range of viruses. Unlike most antibiotics, antiviral drugs do not destroy their target pathogen (something that causes disease); instead they stop their development.

Antiviral drugs are a type of antimicrobials, a larger group which also includes antibiotic (also called antibacterial), antifungal and antiparasitic drugs, or antiviral drugs based on monoclonal antibodies. Most antivirals do not cause much damage to the body, and can be used to treat infections. They are different from viricides, which are not medicine but deactivate or destroy virus particles inside or outside the body. Natural antivirals are made by some plants such as eucalyptus and Australian tea trees.

Viral disease

A viral infection (or viral disease, or infectious disease) occurs when a living thing's body is entered in an unwanted way by disease-causing viruses, and able to be caught from others virus particles (virions) attach to and enter susceptible cells.

Basic structural features, such as genome type, virion shape and replication site, generally share the same features among virus species inside the same family.

Antimicrobial

An antimicrobial is an agent that kills microorganisms or stops their growth. Antimicrobial medicines can be grouped according to the microorganisms they act primarily against. For example, antibiotics are used against bacteria, and antifungals are used against fungi. They can also be classified according to their function. Agents that kill microbes are microbicidal, while those that merely stop their growth are called biostatic. The use of antimicrobial medicines to treat infection is known as antimicrobial chemotherapy, while the use of antimicrobial medicines to prevent infection is called antimicrobial prophylaxis.

The main types of antimicrobial agents are disinfectants (such as bleach), which kill a wide range of microbes on non-living surfaces to prevent the spread of illness, antiseptics (which are applied to living tissue and help reduce infection during surgery), and antibiotics (which kill microorganisms within the body). The term "antibiotic" originally described only those creations that came from living microorganisms but is now also applied to synthetic agents, such as sulfonamides or fluoroquinolones. The term also used to be only applied to antibacterials, but its meaning has widened to include all antimicrobials. Antibacterial agents can be further grouped into bactericidal agents, which kill bacteria, and bacteriostatic agents, which slow down or stall bacterial growth. In response, further advancements in antimicrobial technologies have resulted in solutions that can go past simply stopping germ growth. Instead, certain types of porous media have been made to kill microbes on contact.

Pharmacotheraphy

Pharmacotherapy is therapy using medication, as separate from therapy using surgery (surgical therapy), radiation (radiation therapy), movement (physical therapy), or other methods. Among physicians, sometimes the term medical therapy refers specifically to pharmacotherapy as separate to surgical or other therapy; for example, in oncology, medical oncology is differentiated from surgical oncology. Pharmacists are experts in pharmacotherapy and are responsible for ensuring the safe, appropriate, and economical use of pharmaceutical drugs. The skills required to function as a pharmacist require knowledge, training and experience in biomedical, pharmaceutical and clinical sciences. Pharmacology is the science that aims to continually improve pharmacotherapy. The pharmaceutical industry and academia use basic science, applied science, and translational science to create new pharmaceutical drugs.

ICQ

ICQ is a cross-platform instant messaging and VoIP client. The name ICQ derives from the English phrase "I Seek You". Originally developed by the Israeli company Mirabilis in 1996, the client was bought by AOL in 1998, and then by Mail.Ru Group in 2010.

The ICQ client application and service were initially released in November 1996, freely available to download. ICQ was among the first stand-alone instant messenger (IM)—while real-time chat was not in itself new (Internet Relay Chat (IRC) being the most common platform at the time), the concept of a fully centralized service with individual user accounts focused on one-on-one conversations set the blueprint for later instant messaging services like AIM, and its influence is seen in modern social media applications. ICQ became the first widely adopted IM platform.

At its peak around 2001, ICQ had more than 100 million accounts registered. At the time of the Mail.Ru acquisition in 2010, there were around 42 million daily users. Since 2013, ICQ has 11 million monthly users.

BC Transit

BC Transit is a transit company run by the British Columbian government that gives bus services to many towns and areas in the province.

Before 1979, the power company, BC Hydro, ran the buses. In 1979, the province made the transit company into a separate agency called the Urban Transit Authority which became BC Transit in 1983.

BC Transit transit plans the routes and schedules but doesn't run the buses in most of the province. In 1999, a new company called TransLink was made to run the buses, metro, and trains in Vancouver. BC Transit might give more areas to TransLink one day.

A company called the BC Electric Railway was made in 1897 to replace the Consolidated Railway Company, which had run the streetcars in Victoria, Vancouver and New Westminster. Slowly the streetcars and interurban trains were changed to electric trolley and gas-powered buses. The province made BC Hydro in 1962 to take over when the old company ran out of money.

In 1979, the government made the Urban Transit Authority, to plan and make rules for public transit; and the Metro Transit Operating Company, a separate crown corporation that actually ran the buses. The new structure was meant to provide local governments with more decision-making power and funding of their local systems. BC Transit was in 1982.

In 1999, Vancouver's transit system started to be controlled by a difference company, TransLink.

In 2018, BC Transit started running its first intercity buses in Northern British Columbia after Greyhound Canada stopped running buses in the province. In 2019, drivers got safety doors to stop people from hurting them. During the COVID outbreak in March 2020, BC Transit made buses free everywhere in the province and let people get on in the back door. This lasted until June 1, 2020.

The Victoria Regional Transit System, in the capital, is the only system where the buses are run by BC Transit. Outside Victoria, the bus schedules and routes are made by BC Transit but the buses are driven by other companies. In four places (Nanaimo, Nelson, Powell River, and the Sunshine Coast) the towns run the buses.

BC Transit runs buses for people who have difficulty getting around. These buses are called paratransit and people call for the service to pick them up and drop them off ahead of time.

Because lots of small towns don't have hospitals and doctors, there are also some buses that run from small towns into big cities. These buses don't run often, but they're still very important.

Digital Marketing is different from traditional marketing. Traditional marketing uses offline channels, while digital marketing uses online channels. A traditional marketing campaign, for example, may use billboards, radio ads, and news stories, while a digital marketing campaign may use social media, blog posts, and email to promote a business and its offerings.

The word "digital marketing" first came in the 1990s and the first internet ad was in 1994. Today, digital marketing has become an essential part of advertising with many institutions offering courses due to this demand.

Geometric mean

The geometric mean is a number, which is used to represent a set of numbers. It is calculated by taking the n-th root of the product of these numbers. In symbols, if we have formula_1 numbers formula_2, the geometric mean is
formula_3
What most people refer to when they talk about mean or average is the arithmetic mean. The geometric mean is almost always smaller than the arithmetic mean. In some cases, it is equal. The geometric mean is often used in finance and in statistics.

Because there's a product, it does not make sense to calculate the geometric mean if one of the numbers is zero. It generally also does not make much sense to calculate it when one of them is a negative number. It isn't used for complex numbers, because calculating the root of a complex number has more than one result.

Mastic ice creams

Mastic ice creams (resin based ice cream) is popularly termed for stretchy and sticky textured ice cream, named after the spice - "Mastic (Pistacia lentiscus resin)". These ice creams are based on of Salep or cornflower, rose water, and the "Mastic resin" that contributes to the texture (as opposed to the texture of other ice creams that have a more airy texture) and are commonly used in Middle Eastern cuisine. Today, due to the very high price of the gum spice and the difficulty of obtaining it, there are ice cream sellers who usually replace it with glucose or other ice cream conducive to appear as a sticky dish.

Mastic ice cream was first invented in Turkey during the Ottoman Empire and was called: "Dondurma" and it has been around for 300 years when its recipe was kept secret for many years. there are places in Turkey where it is customary to put the ice cream in a large container equipped with huge spoons for constant stirring, so that you do not over-firm, and serve it in a plate with a knife and fork. The ice cream is very popular in Turkey and there are even street stalls especially for Turkish Mastic ice cream where they pour boiling chocolate syrup over an ice cream cup. There are ice cream vendors who practice juggling and street shows for tourists with ice cream because of its great flexibility and resistance to melting. The ice cream's massive publicity in Turkey has made Istanbul's neighborhood known as "Dondorma".

In the middle of the 19th century a Syrian merchant brought the secret recipe of ice cream from Turkey to Damascus, where he developed a softer local version of ice cream called "Booza", which is lighter And airy from the Turkish version, and from there it was distributed to Arab countries. in the Middle East only sells the Arabic version of the ice cream, while in the Far East only the Turkish version of the ice cream sells.


Definite description

In logic, a definite description is a term of the form 'the ...'. It is used to describe something. This is more difficult than it first appears, because:

Unfortunately, language allows to construct sentences, where the thing or person talked about is not unique, or it doesn't exist

Definite descriptions are called 'empty', if they violate one of the conditions above: Bertrand Russell used the sentence "The present king of Freance is bald.". When Russel wrote this, in the early 20th century, France was a republic, and had no king.

Other famous mathematicians who wrote about it include Gottlob Frege, and Peter Strawson.

The Central Park jogger case was a criminal case in the United States based on the assault and rape of Trisha Meili, a 28-year-old white woman who was jogging in the park, and attacks on eight other people, in areas ranging from the North Woods to the Reservoir of Manhattan's Central Park, on the night of April 19, 1989. 

Three of the victims were black or Latino. Meili was so badly injured that she was in a coma for 12 days. 

"The New York Times" in 1990 described the attack on her as "one of the most widely publicized crimes of the 1980s".

This case is also called the Central Park Five case because of the five suspects accused of rape. The Central Park jogger case famous because it reflects how racial minorities are treated unfairly in the American legal system.

At 9 p.m. on April 19, 1989, a group of teenagers entered Central Park. They began to attack and rob other people in the park.

Patricia Eileen Meili was working at an investment bank at the time of the attack. She was living in the Upper East Side of New York City.

Six people were indicted with rape, attempted murder, robbery, and causing a riot:


Raymond Santana and Kevin Richardson were among the first suspects to be arrested.

On May 1, 1989, Donald Trump took out ads in New York City newspapers. In these ads, he said that the death penalty should be used again and called for the five suspects to be executed. Back then, the state of New York had stopped executing people. 

The Supreme Court said in 1977 during the "Coker v. Georgia" case that people cannot be executed for committing rape. They knew that false rape accusations were used to kill black men or put them in jail.

The convictions of the five suspects were vacated after it was revealed that they were forced to confess.

Also, another man was identified as the rapist. His name was Matias Reyes.

The five men who were convicted sued the city. They got $40 million dollars in all, $1 million for each year they were behind bars. Trump said that the city should not have given them money and that the men didn't have "the pasts of angels."

Trisha Meili wrote a book about her experiences. It is called "I Am the Central Park Jogger". She is now an inspirational speaker. She talks about sexual assault and brain injury.

Antron McCray now lives in Georgia. He is married and has six kids.

Kevin Richardson lives in New Jersey. He is an activist who focuses on reforms in the criminal justice system.

Yusef Salaam lives in Georgia. He is an activist who focuses on reforms in the criminal justice system.

Raymond Santana also lives in Georgia. He is an activist who focuses on reforms in the criminal justice system.

Korey Wise lives in New York City. He changed his name from Karey. He is an activist who focuses on reforms in the criminal justice system.

It has been claimed that the newspaper ads made Trump look racist. Trump is white, while the suspects were Black and Latino.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump said that the suspects were guilty. 

Trump was later elected as the 45th President of the United States. He was president from 2017 to 2021. As of July 2020, he has never apologized for the newspaper ads.

Playdate (console)

Playdate is an handheld video game console by Panic that came out in 2020, however it was delayed from releasing to most people until April 18, 2022. It was first introduced on May 22, 2019 on the cover of Edge magazine. Panic worked with Teenage Engineering, a Swedish consumer electronics company, to design the Playdate.

The Playdate has a black-and-white 1-bit screen, 4 way directional pad, two game buttons, and a mechanical crank on the side.

The Playdate allows games that are not part of a season to be sideloaded without needing to jailbreak it. Games were made using an SDK that came with a simulator and debugger and worked with C and Lua, programming languages. It is only available with the developer kit for Mac. However, in a response, Playdate said they were open to creating software for Windows, and compiling was already available, and the simulator is a work in progress.

The screen technology used is Sharp's Memory LCD, which has some features of e-paper displays. Each pixel can remember if it is black or white without having to be refreshed, resulting in faster refreshing and lower power usage, whilst also being "viewable in any light, from edge-of-vision darkness to brightest sunlight" and having a wide 170° viewing angle.

Games for the handheld came out in 12-game "seasons". A new game was sent over Wi-Fi every week. Each game's contents was kept secret until the week it came out, and would be automatically downloaded. The first season of games were included in the price of the console. Video games were made by Panic, and notable indie game developers such as Keita Takahashi, Zach Gage, Bennett Foddy, Shaun Inman, and Chuck Jordan. Later game titles included "Crankin's Time Travel Adventure", "b360", "Zipper", "Executive Golf DX, Snak, and Sasquatchers".

In a developer survey, Panic said they would like to include games by underrepresented developers, and said season one would contain games by women, and games by "queer/trans/enby" people.

In May 2019, Panic were told off after the details of an email they had sent to an indie video game event that was also named Playdate said to change "their" name to avoid confusion. The next day, one of Panic's founders cancelled the request, saying "My intention was always to find a way for our Playdates to co-exist [...] but we remain fine with you using the name Playdate." On January 29, 2020, the team behind the event (now named "Playdate Pop Up") announced Panic were joining the event as a sponsor, and would help the event to be considered as non-profit.

To SquarePants or Not to SquarePants

"To SquarePants or Not to SquarePants" is the second part of the sixteenth episode of the sixth season of "SpongeBob SquarePants". It was first shown on television on July 17, 2009 as a part of the television marathon called "The Ultimate SpongeBob SpongeBash Weekend." A DVD version of the episode was made on July 21, 2009 and has other season six episodes in it.

A narrator tells about the time SpongeBob changes his pants by starting with SpongeBob puttting his pairs of pants in a dryer. Patrick calls him and makes noises with his tongue. When Patrick stops, SpongeBob checks the dryer and finds out his pants have shrunk. A mall worker tells him that square pants will not be shipped in months. SpongeBob then looks around the mall for a different type of pants. He ends up finding a pair of round pants and decides to buy them. SpongeBob later meets Patrick, who does not recognize him in his round pants. Sandy and Squidward pretend to not recognize him either. Patrick won't let SpongeBob in his house because he says the house belongs to SpongeBob SquarePants.

SpongeBob thinks no one will recognize him in his round pants, so he goes to the Krusty Krab to get hired again. Mr. Krabs does not pretend to not recognize SpongeBob and tells him to get to work. Squidward shows SpongeBob how to be a bad worker without telling him in hopes of getting him fired. Mr. Krabs catches Squidward and SpongeBob sleeping on the job and gets mad. SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that he can not be "SpongeBob SquarePants" because of his round pants. Mr. Krabs tells him to just take off his round pants, leaving him in his underwear. Sandy teases SpongeBob by calling him "SpongeBob UnderPants," making him scream and ending the episode.

Paul Mavis of DVD Talk gave a positive response and says that "There are laughs in 'To SquarePants or Not to SquarePants.'" Judge Gordon Sullivan of DVD Verdict gave the episode a score of 5 out of 10 and said that "[the episode] was one of the slighter entries [on the DVD] with the core joke being fairly well-handled with no one recognizing SpongeBob, but it went on just a little too long."

Apocalypse Cow

"Apocalypse Cow" is the seventeenth episode of the nineteenth season of The Simpsons. It was first shown on television on April 27, 2008 on the Fox network. 7.69 million people watched the episode. In the episode, Bart joins 4-H and saves a cow named Lou. He gives it to a girl named Mary and her father, Cletus Spuckler, thinks that Bart wants to marry her. Jeff Westbrook won a Writers Guild of America Award for writing the episode.

Bart and Lisa watch a cartoon called "Transclown-O-Morphs." The main character tells kids to buy their new cereal to survive an emergency. Marge gets annoyed by the commercials and wants the kids to get away from TV. She gets Lisa to make banana bread and Bart to go to Shelbyville with Homer to have bean bag chairs "rebeaned." While driving, they see Martin Prince driving a combine harvester. Bart asks him why he would drive a combine harvester, and Martin says he joined 4-H. Bart joins and learns how to drive a tractor. A 4-H volunteer tells the members about a competition. He says you have to pick a calf and raise it over the summer, and the cattle will be judged at a county fair.

Bart gets stuck with a weaker cow and can not trade it away. He meets Mary, who gets Bart to not give up on the competition. Through the competition, Bart takes good care of the cow, which he names Lou, and makes him stronger and starts loving him. At the judging, Lou has grown up into a bull and is given a blue ribbon as an award. Bart is very happy until Lisa tells him that Lou will then be sent to a slaughterhouse.

Bart wants Marge and Homer to buy Lou, but do not want to because it is expensive. At night, Bart starts hearing mooing and thinks he is hallucinating, but Lisa tells him it is just a CD of animal sounds that she started playing. Bart, Lisa, and two friends, named Compost and Solar Panel, go to the slaughterhouse at midnight to save Lou. They find Lou and see that he has been fed growth hormone pills and is much bigger, so they use a forklift to move him away from the slaughterhouse. They decide that they should take Lou to Mary's house because it is on a farm. The next morning, they discover that Mary's father is Cletus Spuckler.

Bart gives Lou to Mary. Cletus yells for Brandine, Cletus' wife, to come to the door. Brandine learns about Bart giving Lou to Mary, so she tells Bart that giving a cow means that he has made a proposal of arranged marriage. Bart and Mary do not want a marriage, but Cletus and Brandine plan a wedding for the next day. Lisa tells Bart to go along with it so that they have enough time to figure out how to save Lou because she thinks that Cletus will not keep Lou if Bart doesn't want to get married to Mary. Homer and Marge learn about the wedding and are shocked, but Marge agrees to save Lou because Bart cares deeply for Lou. The next day, Marge stops the wedding and tells Cletus to send Lou to the slaughterhouse. However, Cletus ends up sending Homer in disguise as Lou. The real Lou is sent to India because cows have a sacred status in India. They then save Homer from the slaughterhouse after he nearly gets killed. Homer promises to eat less meat, and Bart says with pride that "I had a cow, man."

Richard Keller of TV Squad thought that the episode was another good episode of The Simpsons that feature Bart and Lisa together and says that "episodes that center around Bart and Lisa tend to be more interesting...because those characters have more dimensions, and their diverse personalities and passions [show that] there is more to explore about them." Robert Canning of IGN enjoyed the episode in a special way and was surprised by some plot elements, giving the episode a 7.5 out of 10. Matt Groening, creator of "The Simpsons", said that this episode was his favorite of the series in a 2008 interview and said that the scene with Homer in the slaughterhouse was the part he liked best.

Anti-Turkish sentiment

Anti-Turkism or Turkophobia is a term of being fearful, racist and discriminative against the Turkish people or Turkic countries.

The term refers to intolerance not only against the Turks across all regions, but also against Turkic groups as a whole, including Azerbaijanis, Crimean Tatars and Turkmens. It is also applied on groups who developed in part under the influence of Turkish culture and traditions while converting to Islam, especially during Ottoman times, such as Albanians, Bosniaks and other smaller ethnic groups around Balkans during the period of Ottoman rule. It can also refer to racism against Turkish people living outside of Turkey following the Turkish diaspora.

The main historical adversaries of Turkic peoples are considered to be Greeks, Armenians, Kurds, and Serbians. The main reasons for these historical conflicts lie in the annexation of their ancestral lands by Turkish colonists.

The roots of "anti-Turkism" can be traced back to the arrival of the Huns in Europe. While the ethnic background of the Huns is a matter of dispute among historians, they are widely believed to have been of Turkic origin, and their invasion inspired fear among Europeans. In the Late Middle Ages, the fall of Constantinople and the Ottoman wars in Europe — part of European Christians’ effort to stem the expansion of the Ottoman Empire, the predecessor to Turkey — helped fuel the development of "anti-Turkism".

Gamergate controversy

The Gamergate controversy is a popular nickname for a controversy about women and video games as well as ethics in video game journalism.

Zoë Quinn designed a video game called Depression Quest about a person who struggles with depression. Several video game journalists praised the game while others said that it was too dark to be a good game. People in the second group claimed that the only reason Quinn’s game was popular was because of people who cared more about feminism and political correctness than about video games. Then, Quinn’s ex-boyfriend started a blog wherein he falsely accused her of having had sex with a male video game journalist in exchange for good reviews. That journalist pointed out that he had never reviewed the game at all and argued that the accusation made no sense. After that a lot of people still started to not only criticize, but also bullying Zoe Quinn on the Internet, including threats of murder, rape or commit other kinds of violence against Quinn. When people came to Quinn’s defense and said that the attacks against Quinn were proof of sexism against video game designers who were not male, they were accused of being social justice warriors (SJWs). Milo Yiannopoulos supported Quinn’s attackers on Breitbart and said that anybody who did not support her attackers was being too politically correct.

Band Geeks

"Band Geeks" is the second part of the fifteenth episode of the second season of "SpongeBob SquarePants". It was first shown on television on September 7, 2001. The episode played the song "Sweet Victory" by David Glen Eisley. In the episode, Squidward tells a lie to his high school enemy, Squilliam Fancyson, that he has a marching band. He gets people from Bikini Bottom to join his band, but they play badly. Squidward quits the band, but SpongeBob gets the band together and practices for a big concert. Squidward thinks the concert will go wrong, but the concert is a success. The episode won the 2002 Golden Reel Awards for Best Sound Editing in Television – Animation.

Squidward gets a call from his old high school enemy, Squilliam Fancyson. Squilliam tells Squidward about his very good life and that he is doing everything Squidward wishes he could do. Squilliam then tells Squidward that his band will be performing at the Bubble Bowl. Squidward gets jealous and lies that he has a marching band and that it will play in the Bubble Bowl instead. After the call, Squidward quickly assembles a marching band with the people of Bikini Bottom.

Squidward has one week to prepare a concert for the Bubble Bowl. The band plays badly through the training. On the first day, Patrick and Sandy get into a fight. On the second day, two flag twirlers are killed when they spin their flags too fast and crash into a blimp. On the third day, Plankton tries to play the harmonica, but the holes are bigger than he is and he gets tired of running to each hole. On the fourth (and last) day, the band plays too loudly, breaking the windows of the building. All of the band then gets into a fight. When class is over, Squidward goes over to the doors and says that he is disappointed in the band for fighting and no longer wants his band to play in the Bubble Bowl. Once Squidward leaves, SpongeBob tells everyone to go through and perform at the Bubble Bowl to make Squidward happy.

On the day of the concert, Squilliam finds Squidward at the Bubble Bowl entrance to see his band play poorly. Squidward says that his band died, but all of the band show up behind Squidward and say they are ready to perform. They enter a dome which takes them to the Bubble Bowl field. Squidward starts conducting with fear that the band will play poorly, but they play successfully. The band performs a song called "Sweet Victory." At the end of the episode, Squilliam faints and Squidward leaps in the air with a cheerful face.

The episode is largely said to be one of the best episodes of the show. Tom Kenny, the voice of SpongeBob, said it is one of his favorite episodes. Michael Cavna of "The Washington Post" said that Squidward's artistic traits and roles in the episode "made this a kids' episode that adults can experience on a whole 'nother level." "The Guardian" said the episode is the second best episode of the show, behind the episode "Krusty Krab Training Video". The episode along with another season two episode, "The Secret Box", have the highest rating out of all of the other "SpongeBob SquarePants" on IMDb with a rating of 9.8 out of 10.

After Stephen Hillenburg, creator of "SpongeBob SquarePants", died, a user on Change.org started a petition for the NFL to include the featured music "Sweet Victory" on the halftime of Super Bowl LIII. The petition got 1.1 million signatures on January 11, 2019. On December 18, 2018, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the stadium used for Super Bowl LIII, posted a scene from the episode on their Twitter page. On January 13, Maroon 5 released a video on Twitter that had a SpongeBob SquarePants episode included for a second.

During the halftime show, a short animation showing Squidward and the scene with the trumpet fanfare was used to introduce Travis Scott, a guest singer for the halftime show. Many fans of SpongeBob were mad because the NFL did not play the full song. However, "Sweet Victory" increased 566% on on-demand streaming when shown on the halftime show. Because of this, the song entered "Billboard"'s United States Hot Rock Songs chart at number 23 and the Kid Digital Song Sales chart at number two, behind Pinkfong's "Baby Shark."

Covid vaccination started for children aged 12-14 in India on 16 March 2022 

In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)which is organizing a billion worldwide fund for fast investment and creation of vaccine candidatesindicated in April that a vaccine may be available under emergency use protocols in less than 12 months or by early 2021. On 4May 2020, the WHO organized a telethon (fundraising event broadcasted via televisions) to raise billion from forty countries to support rapid development of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 infections and deaths. The United States government started Operation Warp Speed to develop a vaccine by January 2021.

PittCoVacc is a vaccine invented by scientists from the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania in the United States. It was invented to protect people from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It was the first vaccine candidate, meaning vaccine that scientists thought would work well, published in a peer-reviewed study, meaning a scientific paper that other vaccine experts had read and approved before it was printed for people to read.

As of April 2020, it has been tested in mice but not in human beings.

PittCoVacc is short for "Pittsburgh coronavirus vaccine".

One of the head scientists, Dr. Andrea Gambotto, said they made the vaccine so quickly because they had worked on other coronaviruses before: "We had previous experience on SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2014. These two viruses, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, teach us that a particular protein, called a spike protein, is important for inducing immunity against the virus. We knew exactly where to fight this new virus. That's why it's important to fund vaccine research. You never know where the next pandemic will come from."

The researchers used laboratory equipment to make pieces of the same proteins that are in SARS-CoV-2. They put the proteins inside the bodies of laboratory mice using a microneedle array, meaning a small patch with about 400 tiny needles made out of other protein and sugar. One of the scientists, Dr. Emrullah Korkmaz, said these needles melt away inside the skin after they release the vaccine. The skin is a good place to put a vaccine because it has many immune cells in it. Then the mice made antibodies, or protective molecules, in their blood. The scientists measured the amount of antibodies and guessed it would be enough to fight off the SARS-CoV-2 virus if the mice were exposed to it. It took about two weeks for the mice to make lots of antibodies.

The scientists said it would be easy to make large amounts of vaccine and large numbers of microneedle arrays to use on people.

Another team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called APN01. They tested APN01 in engineered human tissue. These are human cells put together to act like part of the body, but they are not a whole animal or person. They added a protein called "human recombinant soluble angiotensin converting enzyme 2" (hrsACE2) and saw that it stopped the virus from taking over cells. They named their hrsACE2 APN01.

Other scientists have developed vaccines that use messenger RNA to teach the body to recognize the virus. They say mRNA vaccines take less time to develop and make, than protein or whole-virus vaccines.

Messenger RNA vaccines need to be stored at very cold temperatures. Ordinary refrigerators are not cold enough.

In mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodiesbut they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal. Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work. The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people. Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021.

The Moderna vaccine entered stage-three clinical trials on June 27, 2020. That means it is being tested on humans. Dr. Anthony Fauci said he did not think the vaccine would be dangerous.

On November 16, Moderna said its vaccine was 94.5% effective. The vaccine has to kept colder than freezing but it does not have to be kept as cold as the Pfizer vaccine. Distribution began in February 2021.

The German company BioNTech and Pfizer made a deal with the United States government to make 100 million doses of mRNA vaccine by December 2020. The vaccine completed phase I trials and started its next trial on July 27, 2020. Instead of being a phase II trial or a phase III trial, Pfizer's team was trying to do both phases at once. If the companies could make the vaccine on time, the U.S. government would give them almost US$2 billion. The vaccine is called BNT162b2. BioNTech paid its employees overtime to do extra work. They called this "Project Lightspeed" because they wanted to develop the vaccine quickly.

Because they wanted people to trust the vaccine, Pfizer published the study protocols publicly. That means they told everyone exactly how they were testing the virus. This is information that companies usually keep secret so no one can steal their work.

On November 9, 2020, Pfizer announced that BNT162 was 90% effective at preventing people from catching COVID-19. They asked the FDA to approve the vaccine for emergency use. The company had not yet published the results of the study in a formal scientific paper, so the FDA said they needed time to look at the results for themselves.

The INN (International nonproprietary name) of this vaccine is tozinameran. INNs are a name for a particular vaccine or medicine to be used worldwide.

The adenovirus is the virus that causes the common cold. It does not harm the human body much. Scientists have used the adenovirus in vaccines for many years against many diseases. Scientists take pieces of dangerous viruses and attach them to adenovirus to then inject the adenovirus into the human body. The human immune system learns to recognize the pieces of dangerous viruses. After, it can fight off the real dangerous viruses if the human is ever exposed to them.

In late April 2020, a team from the University of Oxford said that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine. The United States National Institutes of Health tested it in rhesus monkeys and it worked. Because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2. They would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020.

The team took the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 and put it on an adenovirus. Then they injected that virus into test patients. The idea is that the patients' immune systems will learn to attack the spike protein no matter what virus it is on. This vaccine completed phase I trials and as of July 2020 is entering phase III trials. The vaccine is called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.

The Chinese company CanSino Biologics is making a viral vector vaccine. This vaccine uses an adenovirus that has the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 on it. Then the immune system learns to recognize the spike protein. As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase II trials, but the Chinese government gave CanSino Biologics permission to give it to people anyway. They are allowed to give it to people in the Chinese military.

The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is made from the Johnson & Johnson company. Unlike many vaccines, it doesn't need special, unusual refrigeration.

The company Sinovac in China and Bututan research center in Brazil worked together. This is an inactivated virus vaccine. This means the team took the SARS-CoV-2 virus and changed it to make it harmless. The patient's body learns to recognize the harmless virus and then it can recognize the harmful, wild virus too. The company got permission to start phase III trials on July 3. This virus is called CoronaVac.

The company Sinopharm belongs to the government of China. It is an inactivated virus vaccine.
This vaccine started phase III trials in the middle of July 2020. This vaccine does not have a name.

The University of Melbourne and Murdoch Children's Research Institute are studying a vaccine that works against tuberculosis, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine. It is a live-bacterium vaccine. The patiebt gets dead "Mycobacterium tuberculosis" bacteria injected into them while training their immune system to fight it. Over the years, scientists saw that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine did not only protect people from tuberculosis, but it protected them from other diseases too. The scientists at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and University of Melbourne are studying the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine to see if it will protect people from COVID-19. Because this vaccine has already been used for other diseases for more than one hundred years, doctors already knew it was safe to use. As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase III trials to see if it works on COVID-19.

Scientists believe a vaccine that doctors spray into the patient's nose would work better than a vaccine injected into the patient's veins. After a nasal vaccine, the body's immune cells look for the virus in the nose and mouth. The nose and mouth are where most people are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Scientists are not sure why this works. As of July 2020, teams in the Netherlands, the United States, and Canada are making nasal vaccines.

Synoptic Gospels

In the New Testament, the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, are written in a very similar style. They are referred to as the synoptic gospels.The forth of the evangelists, John, also tells similar stories, but his style of writing is different. The synoptic problem is to explain why three of the four evangelists have a very similar structure, and the fourth does not.


The strong parallelism among the three gospels suggests they were written at more or less the same time. Or, Matthew and Luke made use of the gospel of Mark as a source.

É

É or é is a letter that is not regularly found in the English language. It is the letter E with an acute accent above it. It can be found in the Afrikaans, Catalan, Danish, Emilian-Romagnol, French, Galician, Hungarian, Icelandic, Irish, Italian, Kashubian, Luxembourgish, Occitan, Norwegian, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Vietnamese, and Welsh languages. In the English language, it can be found in loanwards (for example, "résumé" and "cliché") and romanizations (for example, "Pokémon").

É is the 9th letter of the Czech alphabet and the Slovak alphabet. In the IPA, it represents /ɛː/ in these languages.

In the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish languages, the letter É is used to show that the regular letter E is stressed. It is used to change the meaning of a word.

É is found in foreign words, mostly from French. It is also used to tell apart the Dutch words "een" (meaning "a" or "an" in English) and "één" (meaning the number one in English). It adds stress in the same way English sometimes uses italics. In Dutch, some people may use the Dutch word "hé" to greet eachother, meaning "hey" or "hi".

In Emilian, é is used as [e] in IPA (for example, "récc", meaning "rich" in English). In Romagnol, é is used as [eː] (for example, "lédar", meaning "thieves" in English).

The letter É appears in words that came from the French language. For example, née, résumé, fiancée, sauté, and coupé. It is also used in names, such as Beyoncé, Breneé, JonBenét, and Théo.

The letter É is widely used in French. It is pronounced as /e/ in IPA. Another french letter, È, is pronounced as /ɛ/. The two letters look the same, but they are not the same letter.

É is the 9th letter of the Hungarian alphabet and is used as /eː/ in IPA.

É is the 7th letter of the Icelandic alphabet and is used as /jɛː/ in IPA.

In Irish, an acute accent is used to mark a vowel as a long vowel. É is used as /eː/ in IPA.

É is used as /e/ in IPA and it carries a tonic accent. It is only used in the last letter of a word (except when a different wikt:pronunciation may change the meaning of a word). For example, "perché" (meaning "why" or "because" in English) and "pésca" (which means "fishing" in English). The letter È is also in the Italian alphabet, which is the letter E with a grave accent. Instead of /e/, the letter È is used as /ɛ/ in IPA.

É is the 8th letter of the Kashubian alphabet and is used as /ɛ/ in IPA. 

É is used to stress an /ɛ/ when the stressed syllable is not known that well (for example, "péssimo", meaning "very bad" in English). É can also mean the word "is", as in "ela é bonita" (meaning "she is pretty" in English). Another letter in Portuguese, the letter Ê, uses /e/. Ê is the letter E with a circumflex.

The letter é is pronounced the same as e (/e/). The accent marks the letter with a stressed syllable in words that do not usually have stress, such as "éxtasis" and "bebé".

The letter É used to be used in the Scottish Gaelic language, but it has been replaced with the letter È, an E with a grave accent.

The letter É is used to put stress on a short vowel. For example, "personél" (meaning "personnel" in English), "sigarét" (meaning "cigarette" in English), and "ymbarél" (meaning "umbrella" in English).

The letter É indicates a rising tone in Vietnamese. It can also be combined with a circumflex to make the letter "Ế".

Arupadai Veedu

The Six Abodes of Murugan (Tamil: "Āṟupadai veedu") are six temples in in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The god is known by different names. Thses include Kartikeya, Kanda, Vadivela and Murugan. The six most sacred abodes of Murugan were written about in Tamil sangam literature. They are mentioned in "Thirumurugatrupadai" by Nakkeerar and in "Thiruppugazh" by Arunagirinathar. The six abodes are Thiruparankundram, Tiruchendur, Palani, Swamimalai, Thiruthani and Pazhamudircholai.

The story of Lord Murugan is written about in Skanda Purana. Legend says that the demon Soorapadman tortured the Devas. They complained to Lord Vishnu and Brahma. Kamadeva was sent to wake Lord Shiva, who later gave birth to Kartikeya. Karthikeya killed Soorapadman and saved the devas. Muruga is shown as the god of love and war. Kartikeya married Valli and Deivayanai .

In Tamil literature five types of lands are explained. They are Kurinji (mountains), Mullai (forest), Marutham (agricultural), Neithal (coastal) and Palai (desert). Each land types has a defferent god. Lord Muruga is a leader of the Kurinji region.

Arunagirinathar was a 15th-century Tamil poet born in Tiruvannamalai. When he was young, he was a rioter and seducer of women. After ruining his health, he tried to kill himself. He did this by jumping from the northern tower of Annamalaiyar Temple. He was saved by the god Murugan. He became a staunch devotee and composed Tamil hymns glorifying Murugan, the most notable being "Thirupugazh". Arunagirinathar went to many Murugan temples. On his way back to Tiruvannamalai, he visited Palani. He sung songs about Swaminathaswamy. Tiruparamkundram is considered the first of the six abodes. This is the only temple where abishekam is performed for Vel instead of Lord Murugan. Palani is considered the most prominent abodes of Lord Muruga.

One of the main traditions of the six temples, is the tonsuring of devotees. They removed their hair to be like the Palani deity. Another tradition is the anointing of the head of the deity's idol with sandalwood paste. This is done at the end of the day before the temple closes. The paste is said to get medicinal properties. It is given to devotees, as "rakkāla chandaṇam".

Brett E. Crozier

Brett E. Crozier is an American naval officer. When he was captain of the aircraft carrier "Theodore Roosevelt", he noticed that some of his crew had caught COVID-19, a disease that affects the lungs and breathing. Late in March, 2020, he wrote letters asking for permission to send his sick sailors off his ship to Guam. These letters were found and printed in a newspaper. A few days later, the Navy fired Crozier as the captain of the "Theodore Roosevelt" but did not fire him from the Navy entirely. 

In late April, some leaders in the Navy asked that Crozier be reinstated and sent back as captain of the "Theodore Roosevelt".

Brett Crozier is from Santa Rosa, California. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1992 and became a pilot for the Navy in 1994. He fought in Iraq in 2003. He later earned a Master's Degree in National Security and Strategic Studies at the Naval War College. He served in many different positions in the Navy, including Executive Officer of the "USS Ronald Reagan". Brett Crozier was captain of the "USS Blue Ridge" from June 2017 to November 2018.

He wrote more than twenty copies of a four-page letter, dated March 30, 2020. He addressed it to senior officials in the military. He asked for permission to send 1000 of his crew off the ship. The ship had more than 4000 people on it. Someone found his messages and they were printed in the newspaper "San Francisco Chronicle" on March 31, 2020.

COVID-19 is very contagious, and people can catch it from other people easily. In the letter, Crozier said that the ship was too cramped to allow for sick sailors to do what the Centers for Disease Control and the Navy's own administration said people with COVID-19 should do: Keep away from other people for 14 days. He asked for permission to let his sick sailors go ashore to Guam, where the ship was docked at the time, and go into quarantine there instead of on board the ship. He copied part of a report about the "Diamond Princess" cruise ship, and said that even though the "Diamond Princess"'s passengers had private rooms, more than 100 people still became infected. He said the "Theodore Roosevelt" only had a few private rooms.

Retired Admiral James Stavridis, who used to be NATO Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, agreed that it was not possible to perform social distancing on board a navy ship like the "Theodore Roosevelt".

High-ranking leaders at the Navy said that removing Crozier from his ship was normal. They said Crozier should have asked for help by going through the chain of command instead of writing letters to other people in the military.

According to Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas B. Modly, Crozier's letter caused naval crews and their families to panic: "It undermines our efforts and the chain of command's efforts to address this problem and creates a panic. And creates a perception that the Navy's not on the job, the government's not on the job."

According to "The New York Times", "a Navy official familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly about it said that the captain had repeatedly asked his superiors for speedy action to evacuate the ship."

Kathleen H. Hicks, who worked at the Pentagon years earlier under President Barack Obama, said that the Navy did have the legal right to fire Crozier but that it might have been a bad idea to do so because it might make sailors and leaders less willing to trust each other.

Royal Thai General System of Transcription

The Royal Thai General System of Transcription (RTGS) is the official system used to write Thai words into the Latin alphabet, or romanization. Thai has certain vowel and consonant sounds and other phonemic features that do not exist in English. This means that saying a syllable with a different tone or vowel length can make a completely different word. For these reasons, romanization in Thai presented many challenges. The RTGS only uses the 26 letters in the ISO standard Latin alphabet to spell Thai words. It is used on all documents that require words to be written in the Latin alphabet, including road signs, maps, applications, etc. However, it has many problems. The system does not show tones or vowel length, both of which are phonemic features of Thai. It also does not tell some of the consonant sounds apart.

Lakewood, Colorado

Lakewood is a city in Colorado, the United States. It was founded in 1889. 
Its population ranks fifth of all the Colorado cities. It ranks 167th (in population) out of all the cities in the United States. 
In 2020, the population was 155,984. Lakewood is to the west of Denver, Colorado's capital. It is one of the key cities of the Denver–Aurora–Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area and a major city of the Front Range Urban Corridor.

This urban and suburban community was started in 1889 by Charles Welch and W.A.H. Loveland; who platted a 13-block area along Colfax Avenue west of Denver in eastern Jefferson County. Loveland used to be the president of the Colorado Central Railroad and lived in Golden. After retiring, he moved to the new area known as Lakewood.

Up until 1969, this area known as Lakewood didn't have a city government. Instead, they relied on water districts, fire districts, and the government of Jefferson County. This area known as Lakewood was more of a community and had been around for 80 years. Police protection was provided to them by the Jefferson County Sheriff and volunteers from fire districts. 

In 1969, the City of Lakewood was legally turned into Jefferson City. Not too long after, they held an election. They decided to change the city's name to Lakewood because the majority disliked "Jefferson City," and believes it would be confused with existing communities in Colorado and Missouri. At this time, the population was already over 90,000.

Lakewood never had a traditional downtown area. West Colfax Avenue served the metropolitan area as U.S. Route 40 and the main route that joined Denver with the Rocky Mountains. Colfax from Harlan west to Kipling and beyond had mostly commercial establishments. Originally, in Lakewood, there was only the Jewish Conspumtive Relief Society (JCRS) for tuberculosis patients, a small, frame Methodist Church, and telephone exchange. However, by the 1950s, grocery and drug stores, gas stations, restaurants and taverns, several motels, branch banks, a movie theater, a roller rink, a bowling alley, and used car lots could be found as well. Several shopping centers with multiple businesses also developed.

In 2011, Lakewood was named an All-America City for the first time.

Lakewood lies in the Colorado Piedmont on the western edge of the Great Plains, just east of the Front Range of the southern Rocky Mountains. Green Mountain, a mesa tall, is located in the far west-central part of the city.

Lakewood is located in the watershed of the South Platte River. Several small tributaries of the river flow east through it. From north to south, this includes Lakewood Gulch, Weir Gulch, Sanderson Gulch, and Bear Creek. Two tributaries of Lakewood Gulch, Dry Gulch and McIntyre Gulch, flow east through the northern part of the city. Turkey Creek, a tributary of Bear Creek, flows northeast through the far southwestern part of the city. In addition, Lena Gulch, a tributary of Clear Creek to the north, flows east then north through the extreme northwestern part of the city.
