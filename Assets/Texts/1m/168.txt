Alan John Percivale Taylor (25 March 1906 – 7 September 1990) was a British historian who specialised in 19th- and 20th-century European diplomacy. He was a journalist and a broadcaster. His television lectures made him famous. He was called "the Macaulay of our age".

He was born in Southport. His parents were pacifists. He was sent to Bootham School in York, a Quaker school. Then he went to Oriel College, Oxford. He and his parents were in the Communist Party in the 1920's. He left it because of the 1926 General Strike. He graduated from Oxford in 1927 with first-class honours. 

His first book, "The Italian Problem in European Diplomacy, 1847–49" was published in 1934. He was a lecturer in history in the University of Manchester from 1930 to 1938. From 1938 to 1976 he was a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and a lecturer at the University of Oxford until 1964. He was stopped from lecturing because of the controversy around his book "The Origins of the Second World War". He said the outbreak of war in 1939 was an unfortunate accident caused by mistakes on everyone's part and was not a part of Hitler's plan.

On 17 March 1942 Taylor made the first of seven appearances on "The World at War – Your Questions Answered" broadcast by BBC Forces' Radio. After the war Taylor became one of the first television historians. He had public arguments with the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper and with Malcolm Muggeridge. He was mentioned in an episode of "Monty Python's Flying Circus."

"The Course of German History" (1945) was a best-seller in both the United Kingdom and the United States. He said Nazi racial imperialism was the same as policies pursued by every German ruler.

His 1965 book "English History 1914–1945" was very popular. He liked to make his books funny.

Rooting Android

Rooting Android means to gain privileged control over the operating system, allowing users to modify and customize their devices beyond what is typically allowed.

When a new Android device is purchased, it comes with certain restrictions placed by the manufacturer and carrier. These restrictions can prevent users from uninstalling pre-installed apps, customizing the look and feel of the device, and accessing certain features. Rooting Android is the process of removing these restrictions and gaining administrative access to the device's system files, allowing users to customize and control their devices to a greater extent. It is similar to iOS jailbreaking but doesn’t commonly have a package manager like Cydia and doesn’t often have tweaks.

There are several benefits to rooting such as:





There are several methods of rooting Android, and the specific method can depend on the device model, Android version, and other factors. Here are some common methods:




It is important to note that rooting can void the device's warranty, and improper rooting can potentially brick the device or cause other problems. It is also worth mentioning that some devices are more difficult to root than others. Users should always research their device before attempting to root it.

Rooting Android can be a powerful tool for users who want to customize and control their devices to a greater extent. However, it is important to understand the risks and potential consequences before attempting to root a device. If done correctly, rooting can unlock new possibilities and features for Android users.

Louis the Child

Louis the Child (893 – 20/24 September 911), sometimes called Louis III or Louis IV, was the king of East Francia from 899 until his death. He was also recognized as king of Lotharingia after 900. He was the last East Frankish ruler of the Carolingian dynasty. He succeeded his father, Arnulf, in East Francia and his elder illegitimate half-brother Zwentibold in Lotharingia. Louis became king when he was six and reigned until his death aged 17 or 18. During his reign the country was ravaged by Magyar raids.

He was born in September or October 893 in Altötting, Duchy of Bavaria, to king Arnulf of Carinthia and his wife, Ota. He had at least two brothers: his elder, illegitimate brother Zwentibold, who ruled Lotharingia, and another brother named Ratold, who briefly ruled the Kingdom of Italy.

Louis was crowned in Forchheim on 4 February 900. Due to his young age and weak personal constitution, the government was entirely in the hands of others - the nobles and bishops. The most influential of Louis's councillors were Hatto I and Solomon III, the bishop of Constance.

Louis succeeded his elder illegitimate half-brother Zwentibold in Lotharingia after 900 and maintained a separate chancery for both regions. He appointed an East Frankish duke, Gebhard to rule Lotharingia, which annoyed the Lotharingian nobility. The Lotharingian nobility did not participate in East Frankish assemblies.

During his reign, the Magyar army devastated Bavaria, the Duchy of Carinthia, and twice ravaged the Duchy of Saxony. In 904, Louis invited Kurszán, the kende of the Magyars, to negotiations. Het killed him and his delegation. In 907, the Magyars inflicted a heavy defeat on the Bavarians in the Battle of Pressburg, killing the Margrave Luitpold and many high nobles.

Louis the Child died at Frankfurt am Main on 20 or 24 September 911, aged seventeen or eighteen. He was buried in the monastery of Saint Emmeram's in Regensburg, where his father Arnulf also lay. His death brought an end to the eastern branch of the Carolingian dynasty. The dukes of East Francia elected Conrad of Franconia, son of Gebhard, as the king, while the nobles of Lotharingia elected the Carolingian Charles the Simple as their king.

History of medicine

The history of medicine is the study of the evolution of medical treatments, practices, and knowledge over time.

Not much is known about medicine in prehistoric times when there were no written records, but it is clear that it was very different in different places. Archaeology has shown that some Neanderthals had healing practices with plants. There is also some evidence of dentistry. 

Under the Babylonians there is written evidence of diagnosis, prognosis, physical examination, and remedies in the 11th century BCE. There are many medical clay tablets from Mesopotamia. They show measures to prevent the spread of disease, accounts of stroke, and an awareness of mental illnesses. We have many medical documents from Ancient Egypt. Some are in magical terms but some show understanding of anatomy. According to Herodotus, "the practice of medicine is so specialized among them that each physician is a healer of one disease and no more."

There is evidence of traditional Chinese medicine from the Zhou Dynasty, and of Ayurveda in India from the same time. Ancient Greek medicine seems to have developed slightly later. Hippocrates and his followers were first to describe many diseases and medical conditions. Galen's theory of humors came from ancient medical works and it was a powerful influence on Western medicine until the 19th century. There were thought to be four humors, or bodily fluids that are linked to illness: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. Herophilos at the medical school of Alexandria developed the study of human anatomy by dissection. With Erasistratus he mapped out the course of the veins and nerves across the human body and studied the brain. Ancient Romans invented many surgical instruments, such as forceps, scalpels, cautery, cross-bladed scissors, the surgical needle, the sond, and speculas.

Constantinople stood out as a center of medicine during the Middle Ages. Islamic medicine grew at the same time, as Greek medical works were translated into Arabic. The Persian polymath Avicenna has been called the "father of medicine". The first Islamic Hospital opened in 805 CE by the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid in Baghdad. Muslim hospitals developed into centres of teaching and research from the 16th century. They had separate wards for male and female patients, pharmacies, medical record-keeping, sanitation and hygiene. Their ideas spread into Europe. After 400 CE, the study and practice of medicine in the Western Roman Empire had gone into deep decline. There were thousands of monastic hospitals in Europe, but the care was poor and mainly palliative.

In the 12th century, universities were founded in Italy, France, and England, which soon developed schools of medicine. Training of physicians began at the University of Bologna in 1219. It was largely lectures and readings of Hippocrates, Galen, Avicenna, and Aristotle. Such care as most people got in Europe was delivered by people who had no training. 

The Renaissance saw an increase in experimental investigation, particularly in the field of dissection and body examination. In 1628 the English physician William Harvey made a ground-breaking discovery when he correctly described the circulation of the blood. Bacteria and protists were first observed with a microscope by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1676.

There was little advance in controlling infections. Most people believed that infections were caused by foul odors called miasmas. Many women died of postpartum infections in hospitals because doctors did not wash their hands. In 1847 in Vienna, Ignaz Semmelweis dramatically reduced the death rate of new mothers by making doctors clean their hands, but his work was rejected for many years. Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch developed germ theory in the 1860s and applied it to the epidemics of cholera. Pasteur went on to develop vaccinations.

SPT-CL J0546-5345

SPT-CL J0546-5345

is a very massive galaxy cluster, it is one of the most massive galaxy clusters ever found in the early universe. The cluster is thought to be located 7 billion light years away. It was discovered at the South Pole Telescope in 2008 by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich-Effect. The cluster has a redshift of z = 1.067. Follow-up studies using the Spitzer, Chandra, and optical telescopes allowed to identify cluster members and to measure the redshift. Using the velocity dispersion, the mass of the cluster has been estimated to 10 solar masses.

Bionic Tower

The Bionic Tower was a visionary vertical city, a very large building designed for human home by Spanish architects Eloy Celaya, María Rosa Cervera and Javier Gómez. It would have a main tower high, with 300 stories housing about 100,000 people. The point of the Bionic Tower is to use bionics to solve the world's rising population problems in an eco-friendly way, a very incredibly hard feat to complete.

The Bionic Tower would be exactly 400 meters taller than the now tallest building, Burj Khalifa.

The Bionic Tower is composed of two complexes put together. The first complex, Bionic Tower, is made up of twelve vertical neighborhoods, each eighty meters high. The neighborhoods are separated by safety areas to make for easier construction and evacuation in case of an emergency. Each neighborhood has two groups of buildings, one on the interior of the building and one on the exterior. Both groups of buildings are located around large gardens and pools. The second complex, also called the Base Island, is 1,000 meters in diameter, and is made up of many buildings, gardens, pools, and communication equipment. Predicted uses of these complexes include hotels, offices, residential, commerce, cultural, sports and relaxation.

In 1997, work on the early model Bionic Vertical Space started. This was created by the architects Eloy Celaya, María Rosa Cervera and Javier Gómez through the beginning of 2001. However, Eloy Celaya, who studied at Columbia University, is creating an another project almost the same to the Bionic Tower project.

While in office, then-Shanghai mayor Xu Kuangdi expressed an interest in the idea for his city. Hong Kong also reportedly expressed interest in the project.

Hindis

The Phou Samsoum tree frog ("Zhangixalus melanoleucus") is a frog. It lives in Laos in Xiengkhouang Province. People have only seen it in one place: Phou Samsoum Mountain. Scientists think it might also live in other mountainous parts of Laos and Vietnam.

Asena

Asena is the name of a she-wolf associated with the myth of the origin of Göktürks, mentioned in "Wolf Tales" recorded by Chinese chroniclers. The legend of Asena tells of a boy who survived the battle; the she-wolf Asena finds the injured child and nurses it, flees her enemies by crossing the West Sea to a cave near the Kocho Mountains and the town of Toharach. Of these, Jizhi Nishidu became their leader and established the Ashina clan, which ruled Göktürk and other Turkic nomadic kingdoms.

Rowing (sport)

Rowing is the sport of racing boats using oars. It differs from paddling sports because the oars are attached to the boat using oarlocks. Paddles are not connected to the boat. Rowing is divided into sculling and sweep rowing. In sculling, each rower has two oars—one in each hand. In sweep rowing each rower holds one oar with both hands. There are several boat classes for competitions. Single sculls are just one person in a small boat. Shells with eight rowers and a coxswain are called eights. There are many types of racing, but most high level racing is on calm water courses 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) long with several lanes marked using buoys.

The first rowing races were on the River Thames in London, in the early 17th century. In the 18th century British public schools set up boat clubs. Later clubs were started at universities in England and America and public rowing clubs started. 

Rowing is one of the oldest Olympic sports. It was on the programme for the 1896 games but the race did not happen because of bad weather. Since then Male rowers have competed in all the Olympics. Women's rowing was added to the Olympic programme in 1976. Today, there are fourteen boat classes which race at the Olympics. 150 countries now have rowing federations. The World Rowing Federation, holds annual World Rowing Championships with twenty-two boat classes.

Labour law

Labour laws (also known as labor laws or employment laws) govern the relationship between workers, employers, trade unions, and the government. 

Individual labour law gives employees' rights at work. Employment standards are social norms (sometimes also technical standards) for the minimum conditions under which people are allowed to work. Government agencies enforce labour law. Trade unions also play an important role in labour law, as they represent workers and negotiate with employers on their behalf.

There were laws in Assyria about work. The Code of Hammurabi set the wages to be paid to an ox driver or a surgeon.

Labour laws developed more as factories were built in the Industrial Revolution. Laws were passed in the United Kingdom in the nineteenth century to stop young children from working in factories. The Earl of Shaftesbury led the campaign for the Factories Act 1833, which limited the employment of children under eighteen years of age, stopped all night work, and provided for inspectors to enforce the law. Later there were more laws about working conditions for all workers. Similar laws were brought into other industrial countries. 

The basic feature of labour law in almost every country is that the rights and obligations of the worker and the employer are set by a contract of employment between the two. In most countries, employers must give their workers a written contract. There may be a minimum wage. There may be rules about how many hours a day people can work, about their rights to holidays and to sick pay. There are often rules about safety at work. There may be laws about treating people fairly and not discriminating.

May 1968 events in France

In May 1968, a period of civil unrest happened in France. There were similar movements around the same time across the world. They inspired a generation of protest art in the form of songs, imaginative graffiti, posters, and slogans.

On 22 March, far-left groups, a small number of well-known poets and musicians, and 150 students occupied a building at the University of Paris at Nanterre. They held a meeting in the university council room about class discrimination in French society and the political bureaucracy that controlled the university's funding. The university called the police, and the students left. There were more conflicts between students and authorities at Nanterre, and the university was shut down on 2 May 1968. Students at the Sorbonne campus of the University of Paris met on 3 May to protest the closure and the threats to expel several students at Nanterre.

On Monday, 6 May, the national student union, the Union nationale des étudiants de France, as well as the union of university teachers, marched to protest against the police invasion of the Sorbonne. More than 20,000 students, teachers, and supporters marched towards the Sorbonne, which was still sealed off by the police, which charged and hit people with their batons. Most of the crowd left, but some began to make barricades out of whatever was at hand. Some people threw stones and forced the police to retreat. The police then used tear gas and charged the crowd again. Hundreds of students were arrested.

The next day, secondary school student unions went to the Arc de Triomphe to demand all criminal charges against arrested students to be dropped, the police should leave the university, and the Nanterre and Sorbonne universities should be reopened.

On Friday, 10 May, another huge crowd gathered on the city's Left Bank. When the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité blocked them from crossing the river, the crowd again made barricades, which the police attacked at 2:15 a.m. after negotiations had stopped. Hundreds of people were arrested and injured. They were seen on television the next day. 

The government had acted in a way that made people support the strikers. Many French singers and poets joined after the police brutality had come to light. American artists also began to support the strikers. The large union federations, the Confédération générale du travail and the Force ouvrière, called for a one-day general strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. More than a million people marched through Paris that day. The police stayed out of sight. Prime Minister Georges Pompidou personally announced the release of the prisoners and the reopening of the Sorbonne, but the protests did not stop.

Students occupied the Sorbonne, declared it an independent "people's university," and went on national television. Many people thought them foolish, but 401 popular action committees were set up in Paris and other parts of France to complain about the government and French society. The demonstrations spread to factories. The unions tried to get people interested in pay rises, but the workers wanted a new government and to get rid of President Charles de Gaulle. Some tried to run their factories themselves. The unions got agreements, which would increase the minimum wage by 35% and all salaries by 10%, more protection for workers and a shorter working day. However, the workers were not satisfied. 

On the morning of 29 May, de Gaulle postponed the meeting of the Council of Ministers that was due that day and secretly removed his personal papers from Élysée Palace. He told his son-in-law, Alain de Boissieu, "I do not want to give them a chance to attack the Élysée. It would be regrettable if blood were shed in my personal defense. I have decided to leave: nobody attacks an empty palace." De Gaulle refused Pompidou's request to dissolve the National Assembly, as he believed that their party, the Gaullists, would lose if there was an election. At 11:00 a.m., he told Pompidou, "I am the past; you are the future; I embrace you." He left by helicopter but did not say where he was going. For more than six hours, nobody in France knew where he was.

He had gone to the headquarters of the French Forces in Germany, in Baden-Baden, to meet General Jacques Massu. In the evening, de Gaulle went to his country home in Colombey-les-Deux-Églises.

On 30 May, 400,000 to 500,000 protesters, many more than the 50,000 the police were expecting, were led by the Confédération générale du travail. They marched through Paris and chanted, ""Adieu, de Gaulle!"" ("Farewell, de Gaulle!"). Maurice Grimaud, the head of the Paris police, played a key role in avoiding revolution by both speaking to and spying on the revolutionaries and by carefully avoiding the use of force. People thought that the Communists were going to seize power in Paris, and Pompidou prepared the army.

At 2:30 p.m. on 30 May, Pompidou persuaded de Gaulle to dissolve the National Assembly and call a new election by threatening to resign. At 4:30 pm, de Gaulle broadcast his own refusal to resign. He announced an election would be held on 23 June, ordered workers to return to work, and threatened to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The government had leaked to the media that the army was outside Paris. Immediately after the speech, about 800,000 supporters marched through the Champs-Élysées waving the national flag. The Gaullists had planned the rally for several days, and it attracted a crowd of mixed ages, occupations, and politics. The Communists agreed to the election, and the threat of revolution was over.

Workers gradually returned to work or were taken from their factories by the police. The national student union called off street demonstrations. The government banned a number of leftist organizations. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. De Gaulle's fears were wrong since his party won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history in the election held in June by taking 353 of the 486 seats. The Communists got only 34 and the Socialists 57.

May 1968 was an important moment in French politics. It represented for some the possibility of liberation and for others the dangers of anarchy. Someone who took part in or supported the period of unrest is referred to as "soixante-huitard" (literally a "Sixty-Eighter") .

"Sous les pavés, la plage!" ("Under the paving stones, the beach!"), is a slogan coined by student activist Bernard Cousin. When the students lifted the pavement to make barricades, they found sand under it.

Stress–strain curve

A stress-strain curve is a graph that is used to describe the relationship between stress and strain of a specific material; with stress being captured on the y-axis and the strain on the x-axis. Stress is the amount of force needed to change the material's shape: in this case, to make it longer. Strain is a measurement of how much the shape changes.

This graph is usually made by testing a material with a tensile test. The test consists of a force, of varying amount, is used to pull the sample apart at a constant rate until it breaks. This graph is used to show important characteristics of a material such as the yield strength, ultimate strength, fracture point, strain hardening, necking and Young's modulus.


Inherent vowel

An inherent vowel is a vowel that must be spoken, even if it is not written down. Inherent vowels exist in abugidas, or alphabets centered around consonants. Most words in abugidas have consonants and vowels written in them, but even if a word if written without any vowels, a vowel must still be spoken.

For example, the word for "ant" in Thai มด would be written as "md" in the Roman alphabet, but it must be said as "mót", with "ó" being the inherent, unwritten vowel in the word.

An example of a word in Thai with two or more syllables an an inherent vowel is สวัสดี, which would be written as "swàtdee" without spaces and "s-wàt-dee" with spaces, but it must be pronounced as "sà-wàt-dee" because even though the first syllable is only written as "s", in must be spoken as "sà" because consonants may not be spoken without any vowels. 

The names of Thai letters show how inherent vowels are used. In Thai, each letter's name has at least two syllables, with the first being the consonant with the inherent vowel and the second syllable being the word where the consonant is used. The letter ก is named ก ไก่, or "gaw gài." The letter itself, the first syllable, is always pronounced with -"aw" after the consonant.

Writing systems with inherent vowels often use a special marking to silence the inherent vowel so that only a consonant is spoken, such as the "virama" found in many South Asian scripts. Other systems rely on the reader's knowledge of the language to know the difference between a consonant with the inherent vowel from a pure consonant (Hindi, Old Persian cuneiform) or to know a particular vowel-marked form from a pure consonant (Ge'ez and related scripts).

For example, the Hindi word कष is pronounced "kaṣa", but क्‌ष is pronounced "kṣa", because the virama symbol ् silences the inherent vowel in क "ka."

Military uniform

A military uniform is a set of clothes worn by people in the armed forces. A uniform makes it easy to see that a person is in the forces, and which side they are on. A uniform may be made to impress people, or to frighten them. 

In Hannibal's army there were soldiers who wore white tunics with crimson edgings. The Roman armies had uniforms. Their commanders had white cloaks and feathers on their helmets. The centurions had special helmets, and chest ornaments a bit like modern medals 

The normal 18th century military uniform in Europe was a three sided hat, long-skirted coat, waistcoat and breeches. Uniforms got more colourful after the Napoleonic Wars. British soldiers had red clothing and were called "Redcoats". By the time of the First World War most uniforms were much duller, and less expensive, because the armies were very large. Grey, khaki and blue were the common colours. Steel helmets became very common. 

By World War II plain and practical combat dress had replaced the colourful uniforms, except for parades. Now almost all armies wear some sort of camouflage. 

There may be different uniforms for different activities. There may be a dress code. For actual fighting there may now be camouflage. In the past there was often armour. People who have won medals or awards may put them on their uniform or be given special uniform for a parade.

James Gordon Meek

James Gordon Meek is a senior American journalist who worked for ABC News and won many awards, before he was arrested after the FBI searched his house and found hundreds of images of child pornography and evidence he was sexually abusing children, and spoke about having raped a young toddler girl and had a video of it. The media referred to other items on his computers and phones as showing "really disturbing images of child sex abuse". He was sentenced to 6 years in prison.

Meek was a drummer for a rock music band along with other journalists, and spent years working in amateur journalism and publishing an internet blog or webzine about politics, as he lived near Washington DC. He began working for the New York Daily News. He was invited by Peter King to become an expert for the House of Representatives, giving advice about preventing terrorism. He then joined ABC News as a senior producer.

A website named Dropbox noticed that Meek had uploaded five videos showing children being raped. They contacted police. Because Meek was a journalist, police had to be very careful not to do anything wrong that would make people believe they were bullying Meek for his work, which sometimes said bad things about the government. Searching through his computers and cellphones, police discovered hundreds of images - some that appear to be downloaded from the internet, and some which appear to be made by Meek himself - showing both violent rape and less violent sexual abuse of children of all ages.

The Court initially said Meek did not have to sit in prison while he waited for his trial and could be released on bail, but the government lawyers complained and the Court agreed to keep him in prison until his trial. The story was notable because other journalists knew that Meek had been arrested for child pornography, but they either did not write about the news or else wrote false stories that lied and made readers believe he had been arrested for being too good of a journalist. Many people believed this lie, and got angry with the Biden Administration saying they were being unfair to a journalist - so the government had to explain that he was believed to be raping children and sharing images and videos of it on the internet.

His daughter Madhumati married Harinasva of Ikshvaku race, from whom Yadu was born again, this time being ancestor of Yadavas. Nanda, the foster father of Krishna, was born in the line of succession of Madhu and ruled from the same side of Yamuna. Jarasandh, Kansa's father-in-law, and king of Magadha attacked Yadavas to avenge Kansa's death. Yadavas had to shift their capital from Mathura (central Aryavart) to Dwaraka (on the western coast of Aryavart) on the Sindhu. Yadu was a legendary Hindu king, believed to be an ancestor of the god Krishna, who for this reason is sometimes referred to as Yadava.

They have large disks for climbing on all their front and back toes. This frog can change color. It can change from dark brown to light green. These frogs can have yellow, blue, or white spots or other marks. There is yellow color on the belly and legs. The iris of the eye is yellow in color.

Adult frogs live in trees. When it is time to lay eggs, they move to rice paddies or ponds.

Frogs go back to the same place to lay eggs. The male frog digs a hole in the mud near a rice paddy or pond, sometimes underneath straw or leaves. The male frog sits in the hole and sings for the female frogs. Sometimes the male frogs fight each other. The female frog then lays her eggs in the hole. She covers them in foam. She lays 300-400 eggs at a time. The tadpole is gray-white in color with spots. The tadpoles swim in the water at the bottom of the hole for about 40 days. Then it rains, and the rain pushes the tadpoles into the rice paddy or pond.

This frog is not in danger of dying out, but there are fewer of them than there were. This is because it lays eggs in rice paddy fields where human beings grow rice, but people in Taiwan decided to grow different foods instead. So there are fewer places for the frogs to lay eggs where tadpoles can grow.

Public library

A public library is a library that is open for anyone to borrow books without having to pay. They are usually paid for by taxes.They are usually run by librarians. They may run free services like reading clubs and they have places for people to study. They may have reference collections - books that have to stay in the library and provide computers and Internet for the public.

The first known libraries were in the Fertile crescent 5000 years ago - with clay tablets, not books. . 

Circulating libraries and subscription libraries came before public libraries, in the 18th and 19th centuries. In England in 1790, there were about six hundred rental and lending libraries, with about fifty thousand members. People had to pay to borrow the books. The first community-run public library, the Malatestiana Library, started in 1447 in Cesena, Italy. Chetham's Library in Manchester, claims to be the oldest public library in the English-speaking world. It opened in 1653. Biblioteca Palafoxiana in Puebla City, Mexico, is recognized by UNESCO as the first public library in the Americas. It was founded in 1646. People could not usually borrow the books from these early libraries. 

In the United Kingdom parliament it was suggested that public libraries might draw people away from public houses. The Museums Act 1845 allowed boroughs to raise money for public museums and libraries. Warrington opened a Municipal Library in 1848. Most of the early public libraries were helped by donations from philanthropists. Andrew Carnegie paid for many public libraries across the English-speaking world.

Lord Vetinari is then betrayed by his sidekick Lupine Wonse who locks Vetinari in his own dungeon with Captain Samuel Vimes. Vetinari tells Vimes he would never create a dungeon that he didn’t know how to escape so Vimes finds a secret passage but Vetinari remembers where in the dungeon he hid the key and escapes.

Kvænangen has an area of . However, it has a small population of only 1,159 people. The population density is very low, with only 0.6 people living in each square kilometre of land (2/sq mi). Over the last ten years, the population has decreased by 9.7%.

The municipality of Kvænangen was established in 1863 when it was separated from the large Skjervøy Municipality. The area was named after the Kvænangen fjord, which is the main geographic feature for the municipality. Over time, fisheries became a primary industry, and the community exported dried fish to southern areas. Eventually, people native Norwegians moved to other places to help with business and government tasks. 

The population is primarily of Sámi origin, although the Kven people also make up a part of the population. 

The Norwegian Meteorological Institute has been operating a weather station in Nordstraum in Kvænangen since 1965. 

During the Nazi occupation during World War II, a temporary work camp was established at Kvænangen. In large part due to the generosity of the local population, prisoners had ample food. As the German Wehrmacht retreated in early 1945, the population was evacuated by force, and all buildings were burned. Today, a local museum shows typical reconstruction houses. Archeological finds indicate nomadic activity in the area going back 10,000 years. 

The geography of Kvænangen is varied, with coastal and plains geography, extending into Finnmarksvidda. There are mature pine forests in the valley at the head of the fjord, and there are several rivers, the largest of which is Kvænangselva. The Øksfjordjøkelen glacier is located in the northern part of the municipality on the border with Loppa.

Premiers and chief ministers of the Australian states and territories

In Australia, a Premier is the head of government of a state, while a Chief Minister is the head of government of a territory.

In colonial times, the five British colonies on mainland Australia, along with the Van Diemen's Land colony of Tasmania and the colony of New Zealand, had their own Governor, a title that eventually was changed to "Premier". Back then, the two territories did not exist, so the colonies represented what we today know as the six states and New Zealand (which is not part of Australia and now has a Prime Minister). Today, the Governor serves as the head of state of a state and the King is the head of state of Australia (but is represented by the Governor-General when he is absent).

Until the creation of the Australian Labor Party (a centre-left, social democratic party), there were no political parties in Australia, so the Premiers were all independents.

On a federal level, Australia's head of government is called the Prime Minister, but because Australia formed as a federation of six British colonies, each state and territory has their own level of government, which is the second-highest level in Australia (the lowest being local government, which is made up of different councils).

Like the Prime Minister, Premiers and Chief Ministers are the state/territory leader of the party that forms government. Currently, the Labor Party forms a majority government in four states (Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia) and in the Northern Territory, as well as federally. In Tasmania, the Liberal Party (a centre-right, liberal conservative party) currently governs with a majority. In New South Wales, the Labor Party governs in a minority government (with the support of three independents on confidence and supply, meaning they can vote differently to the Government but still allow them to govern), while in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), the Labor Party forms a coalition government (meaning more than one party is in the Cabinet) with the Greens (a left-wing, progressive green party, meaning they mostly focus on issues like climate change). When a party is unable to win a majority of seats in the Lower House, the party with the most seats must seek support from the crossbench (a crossbencher is someone who is not from either the Government or the Opposition). Then they can form either a coalition government with the crossbenchers or they crossbenchers can give them confidence and supply. For example, it is very common federally and in New South Wales and Victoria for the Liberal Party and the National Party to form a coalition, regardless of if they are in Government or Opposition. This is commonly called the Coalition. In Queensland and the Northern Territory, these two parties merged to become the Liberal National Party (LNP) and the Country Liberal Party (CLP), respectively. In Western Australia, it is also common for the Liberals and the Nationals to form the Coalition, but the agreement is different there in that the parties are still independent of each other. In South Australia and Tasmania, the Coalition has existed before but currently does not exist, as the Nationals have not very much activity there and they have no seats in those states, while in the ACT the Coalition does not exist because the Nationals do not have a branch their, only the Liberals do (this is because the Nationals represent regional, rural and remote interests (this is called agrarianism), but almost all of the ACT is the city of Canberra).

Jewish Renewal

Jewish Renewal is a Jewish religious movement that started in the 1970s and 1980s and works toward the fusing of modern Judaism with incluences from Kabbalah, Hasidism, and various musical and meditation practices. The founder of Jewish Renewal was Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi who was originally from the Chabad Hasidic community. The Jewish Renewal movement has trained rabbis who would go on to serve in Reform and other non-Orthodox synagogues, bringing Hasidic and mystical Jewish practice to these other settings. Because of this, Jewish Renewal is sometimes described as "transdenominational", meaning that its followers and influence are not restricted to a single type of community.

Another major leader of Jewish Renewal is Rabbi Arthur Waskow who emphasised creativity in Jewish practice and the need to combine religion and advocacy on social issues.

The original Jewish Renewal group was called "B’nai Or Religious Fellowship", later renamed from "B’nai Or" ("Children of Light") to "P'nai Or" ("Faces of Light"). It was later renamed to ALEPH. The ALEPH organization ordained rabbis, cantors, and other rabbinic pastors. Over 200 rabbis were ordained through Jewish Renewal.

Most Jewish Renewal congregations and other religious activities are in the United States, however, some Jewish Renewal rabbis and centers are located elsewhere around the world.

The relative size of Jewish Renewal is somewhat small, but it is not known exactly. The total number of Jews affiliated with Jewish Renewal is not known. However, Jewish Renewal, along with Reconstructionist Judaism and Humanistic Judaism (and other such minor Jewish religious groups), represent around 4% of the roughly 7.5 million Jews in the United States (or 300,000 Jews).

Sarod

Sarod is a string instrument from the Indian subcontinent. The sarod does not have frets, so it can bend pitches and do glissandi (slides). The sarod is played using a plectrum.

Tablet (pharmacy)

A tablet (also known as a pill) is a drug in solid form taken by mouth .They have active substances and excipients, usually in powder form, that are pressed into a solid. Excipients are not drugs. They are added to make the tablet easier to make or to swallow. The main advantages of tablets are to make sure the person gets the right amount of medicine that is easy to consume.

Tablets are prepared either by moulding or by compression. They used to all be disk shaped, but now they are made in many shapes and colours to help people tell the difference between different medicines. Tablets are often marked with symbols, letters, and numbers. Some have a groove to allow splitting by hand. Sizes of tablets to be swallowed range from a few millimetres to about a centimetre.

The first pills known were found on papyruses in ancient Egypt around 1500 BC. They were made of bread dough, honey or grease mixed with plant powders or spices. Before that medicine was mostly in liquid form. Tablets can be hard to swallow, so they were sometimes coated with sugar or gelatin. Some tablets are really capsules. They can be made in many different shapes.

Overproduction

In economics, overproduction is when there is too much supply over the demand. This makes the product priced lower and leaves unsold goods.

Green March

The Green March ("in" "Spanish: La Marcha Verde; in French: La Marche Verte; in Arabic: المسيرة الخضراء; romanized:" Almasirat Alkhadra) was a civil and military operation carried out by the government of the Moroccan king Hassan II. More than 350.000 unarmed civilians and 25.000 soldiers of the Moroccan army invaded the Spanish Sahara in the year 1975. This demonstration was made as a way to force Spain to give the region to Morocco, and to establish total control from Rabat over the disputed territory. At this moment, Spain was passing through a period of instability. The "Caudillo" and dictator, Francisco Franco, was dying and the control of the country was under the hands of who will become the king of the country, Juan Carlos I. Because of the instability the country was passing through, it was impossible for Madrid to respond to this agression committed by the Moroccan government, forcing the Spanish State to give control of the region to Morocco in the 31st of October of the year 1975. As a consequence of this situation, the territory passed to be controlled by Morocco and Mauritania, but legally speaking (according to international law), the region is still a colony of Spain that needs to pass through a process of decolonization.

Before this invasion, the Western Sahara was in a process of decolonization from Spain. In which the indigenous population, the sahrawis, were claiming their independence. But, the Green March happening, this provoked a rejection from the natives towards what they consider "occupiers". The majority of Sahrawis united into the Frente Polisario to resist Moroccan occupation, starting a conflict that found a ceasefire agreement brokered by the United Nations in 1991.

According to the international community, the Green March was an illegal act made by Morocco and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic is right now recognised by more than 82 countries as the sovereign state of the region. The United Nations doesn't recognize any Moroccan claim for Western Sahara since 1975 and is trying to solve by any diplomatic means this conflict.

During the Berlin Conference of 1884, Spain was looking for some benefit in sharing the African continent. As a result of these negotiations, the territories of Equatorial Guinea and Western Sahara were handed over to Spain. At the beginning ot the spanish colonization of Western Sahara, Spain signed different treaties with the native tribes of the Sahara Desert in order to establish its rule over this territory. Once these treaties were signed, Spain started to build military bases and administrative outposts in the region, progressively expelling the sahrawis from their ancient territories and subjugating them to the Hispanic domain to work in the exploitation of resources in the area. Spain's colonization of Western Sahara was marked by violence and oppression, as it sought to subjugate the local population and exploit the region's resources by using strategies such as foced labor and military repression.

According to Virginia Bouvier and Mieczyslaw Boduszynski (2008), Spain's colonization of Western Sahara was driven by a desire to secure its interests in North Africa. They argue that Spain saw this region as a strategic position because of its closeness to important trade routes and its access to the Atlantic Ocean. According to Lisa Shelley, Spain legitimized its rule over the region by promoting the idea that it was bringing "civilization" to the Sahrawi people, through the ""evangelizing"" task of a Catholic nation.

The Spanish colonization of Western Sahara in the late 19th century, Spain jus founded small outposts closer to the coast and they did not witnessed any resistance. But, in the early 20th century, Spain tried to increase its domain , provoking a response from Sahrawi people against Spanish rule. These kind of resistance varied during this period of time, between armed rebellions and civil disobedience against Spanish authorities that ended up in nothing significant for Sahrawis. 
With the pass of years, Sahrawi resistance grew in numbers and became more organized. in 1973, inspired by the independence of Equatorial Guinea in 1968 as part of the decolonization project of the United Nations.

, the ""Frente Popular de Liberación de Saguía el Hamra y Río de Oro"", or Polisario (in Arabic: الجبهة الشعبية لتحرير الساقية الحمراء ووادي الذهب, "al-Jabhah al-Shaʿbiyah Li-Taḥrīr as-Sāqiyah al-Ḥamrāʾ wa Wādī al-Dhahab)" is founded with the goal obtain independence for Sahrawis from Spain. The Frente Polisario launched a guerrilla war against Spanish forces. The Polisario Front had support from different International actors such as the Soviet Union, Algeria, Cuba, Libya, Tanzania, Ghana, and Zambia; who asked for the right for self-determination of the Western Saharan people.

In the year 1975, the Polisario Front achieved a "de Facto" withdrawal of most Spanish troops and administrative personal from Western Sahara. In 1974, Spain announced a decolonisation plan for the region which included the convening of a referendum to determine the future status of the territory.

King Hassan wanted the march to represent how many people there were born in Morocco yearly. Therefore the march consisted of 350,000 unarmed Moroccans. The volunteers were partly local and provincial officials, but mostly the volunteers came from the general public. It was important for the king that the volunteers were loyal, and therefore most of the volunteers came from rural areas, as most support came from these areas. To make sure the volunteers were motivated to participate in the march, the King claimed them as 'holy warriors' to fight against the European influence on "Moroccan soil". The march started on the 6th of November and lasted for four days. In order to prevent violence as the marchers approached the borders, the Spanish Armed forces were instructed not to open fire.

The Madrid Records

As a response to the March, Spain signed an agreement to give up their claim on the territory in November 1975. If this agreement was because Spain wanted to avoid military confrontation or because of the pressured of the United States is still unknow. The declaration involved also Mauritania, as they had related demands to the get Spain out of the territory. The agreement entailed that Spain would leave the territory to decolonize Western Sahara by giving up their responsibility and power over the area. However, this agreement included that Spain would proceed to have temporary administration in the territory but with a collaboration with Morocco and Mauritania. 

How much of positive consequences this had for the Saharans in questionable. The Saharans opened the <nowiki>"liberators"</nowiki> from Morocco with open arms according to Morocco. However, there were reports from the Spanish press stating that Morocco tried to isolate them from their new administrators, giving them curfews from dusk to dawn and was surrounded by Moroccan army in heavily armed convoys. Nevertheless, the material living conditions for the Saharans was devastating. Living under extreme conditions of deprivation with several diseases called out for a bigger political solution for the Saharan people.

The International Respond

The battle for self-determination and maintaining their own identity for the indigenous people of Western Sahara still occurred after the Green March, and for the decolonization of the Western Sahara, this has urgent consequences. The Sahrawi population has been living under Moroccan occupation, where the government have tried to resettle Moroccan people towards the Western Sahara in order to limit the Sahrawi influence. Moreover, their human rights have been abused. Article 1 of UN specifies that people have the right to self-determination to freely control their own political status and economic and cultural development. This is particularly significant to develop friendly relations among nations. UN had therefore a responsibility to take action towards this situation. At the end of 1980s, the UN saw a possibility to seek a peaceful resolution in the Western Sahara, and made a Settlement Plan between the two parties of Morocco and Frente Polisario. The plan entailed that the Sahrawi people could choose between independence or integration into Morocco, and therefore a pathway to self-determination. This would happen through a free and fail referendum. However, in the step of doing the referendum, Morocco wanted that their own citizens to be able to vote as well. That did not go though and as a consequence, Morocco made their citizens lodge against the UN voter list which damaged the referendum and weakened the hope for self-determination for the Sahrawi population. In 2003 the UN proposed a new peace plan for self-determination which the Polisario accepted, while Morocco in 2004 rejected the plan and would not accept independence of Western Sahara.

Several solutions were proposed to solve the hope for self-determination including the Settlement Plan and division of the territory which was rejected by both parties, there was a question of whether the UN should announce that they would not be able to resolve the situation or coming up with a new plan. James A. Baker, which served as the UNs secretary-general's personal's envoy for Western Sahara from 1997 to 2004, was asked by the UN to come up with a new plan, but this did not work out either. Baker decided to resign as he was no longer able to find a mutually accepted solution from both sides. Morocco was content with this solution as they felt this was positive for the diplomacy for Morocco, while the Polisario felt that they lost someone that was willing to fight for their cause. Today, the fight for self-determination for Western-Sahara still remains.

Dental fillings

Dental fillings, or Dental restoration, is the work of dentists repairing teeth. For a filling the dentist has to remove decay with a drill, a laser or air abrasion. Air abrasion is a bit like sand blasting. Then the hole must be filled, usually with amalgam. There are different kinds of fillings.

For some problems inlays and onlays, crowns, bridges, and veneers may be used.

If the tooth has been removed it may be replaced by a "d"ental implant which is fixed into the jaw, or by a denture (false teeth), which may be fixed to the remaining teeth or may be removeable.

Palliative care

Palliative care is care for people approaching the end of life. It is designed to improve the quality of their life. It is not only for people near the end of life, but for people with problems that are not thought to be curable. According to the World Health Organization it should include the treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial, and spiritual. Treatment that is designed to cure people may be unpleasant and often neglects problems which are not medical. 

Medical treatment is to deal with the symptoms of an illness. There may be counselling or therapy, which may include a chaplain, or pets, to deal with a person's worries. There is a lot more attention to dealing with pain than in curative treatment. 

This care may happen in the person's own home, a hospital or a hospice. In the United States, hospice treatment is a benefit provided by the federal government since 1982. In other countries a hospice is a specialized service often from a charity. Even in the richest countries only a minority of people get any palliative care. 

Traumatology

Traumatology (from Greek "trauma", meaning injury or wound) is the study of wounds and injuries caused by accidents or violence to a person, and the surgical therapy and repair of the damage. It is often linked to orthopedic surgery. Psychological traumatology deals with the mental problems caused by accidents or violence. These problems may happen to a person who is close to someone who has been damaged, even if they have not themselves been injured. Post-traumatic stress disorder is not an uncommon reaction. 

Head and neck injuries require the most care after surgery and are most likely to cause death and disabilities.

Air ambulances

Air ambulances use fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters to provide various kinds of medical care, especially emergency care for people mostly in rescue operations.

This started in World War I. In Australia the Flying Doctor Service started in 1928. That was not only for emergencies, but also to take doctors to see people who lived in remote places. More recently helicopters have been used in cities for major trauma cases where time matters most, and people need very specialised care, but they are more common in rural areas where there are few people and they are a long way away from hospitals.

Some of these services are run by governments. They are quite expensive. Some are run for profit and in some places they are run as charities. Some businesses pay for them as as a goodwill or public relations gesture. 

Large, generally fixed-wing, air ambulances are used by military forces to support overseas combat operations. 

Both pilots and medical staff need to be very highly trained. The aircraft are generally equipped for advanced life support. They are very noisy and there is not much space so some medical tests cannot be done. There have been quite a few crashes.

The prefix Nord- was added to the name to distinguish the municipality from the nearby Sørreisa Municipality to the south. The coat of arms of Nordreisa has two salmon, which were chosen to represent the local Reisaelva river.

Most people living in Nordreisa have ancestors who were settlers from Finland who came over in the 18th century, escaping famine and war. Some people living there have Sámi or Norwegian ancestors. Today the Norwegian language is most commonly used. Few old buildings survive in Nordreisa; virtually everything was destroyed in early 1945 by retreating German troops. However, in the old trading post at Havnnes, there are old homes that escaped the damages of the war. There is also the waterfall of Mollisfossen, which is high.

All municipalities in Norway, including Nordreisa, are run by a municipal council. The members of that council, will again choose a mayor in 2027. The municipality is in charge of things like schools, healthcare for people who don't stay in the hospital, support for senior citizens or older adults, helping people without jobs, planning land use, improving the economy, and keeping the roads in good shape. Nordreisa's legal cases are handled by the Nord-Troms District Court and the Hålogaland Court of Appeal.

Nordreisa Municipality is located by a fjord and a valley. It also includes part of an island and a mountain. Other municipalities and countries surround it. 

The weather is mostly cold, and the rainy season is in the autumn. It can get very hot in the summer sometimes. The highest temperature recorded was in August 2018. A weather station has been there since 1974 to record the weather.

Khoekhoe language

The Khoekhoe /ˈkɔɪkɔɪ/ language ("Khoekhoegowab"), or Nama ("Namagowab") /ˈnɑːmə/, Damara ("ǂNūkhoegowab"), Nama/Damara, and Hottentot, is the most common of the non-Bantu languages of Southern Africa that make much use of click consonants. Because of that, Khoekhoe used to be Khoisan, but this group is not used now. It is part of the Khoe language family, and is used in Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa, usually by three ethnic groups: Namakhoen, ǂNūkhoen, and Haiǁomkhoen.

The Haiǁom, who before used a Juu language, moved to Khoekhoe. The name "Khoekhoen", is from the word "khoe" "person", copied twice and the suffix "-n" to be the general plural. Georg Friedrich Wreede was the first European to look at the language, after going to ǁHui!gaeb (later Cape Town) in 1659.

Khoekhoe is a national language in Namibia. In Namibia and South Africa, state-owned broadcasting corporations make and give out radio programs in Khoekhoegowab.

It is thought that only about 167,000 users of Khoekhoegowab live in Africa, making it an endangered language. In 2019, the University of Cape Town did an amount of short courses (classes) teaching the language, and on 21 September 2020 started its new Khoi and San Centre. An undergraduate degree series of classes is being developed.

Present-day scholars generally see three dialects:


They are different enough that it possibly may be thought of as two or three different languages.


Khoekhoe uses 5 vowel qualities, seen as oral (sounds produced with the help of the mouth) /i e a o u/ and nasal /ĩ ã ũ/. /u/ is strongly rounded, /o/ only softly. /a/ is the only vowel with a good amount of allophony; it is pronounced [ə] before /i/ or /u/.

Nama is seen as having three or four tones, /á, ā, à/ or /a̋, á, à, ȁ/, that may take place on different mora (vowels and final nasal consonants). The high sound is higher when it takes place on one of the high vowels (/í ú/) or on a nasal (/ń ḿ/) than on mid or low vowels (/é á ó/).

The sounds combine, (move together) starting a small number of 'tone melodies' (word sounds), which have sandhi forms in certain syntactic places. The most important melodies, in the way that it is said and main sandhi forms, are as follows:
Under a phrase (part of a sentence), lexical words receive greater stress than grammatical words. Using a word, the first syllable receives the most stress. Syllables afterwards get less and less stress and are spoken more and more quickly.

Nama has 31 consonants: 20 clicks and only 11 non-clicks.

Orthography in brackets.

Between vowels, /p/ is said [β] and /t/ is said [ɾ]. The affricates strongly aspirate, and may be thought of phonemically as aspirated stops; in Korana they use [tʰ, kʰ].

Beach (1938) said that the Khoekhoe of the time had a velar lateral ejective affricate, [kʟ̝̊ʼ], commonly seen in languages with clicks. This sound no longer occurs in Khoekhoe but remains in its cousin Korana.

The clicks are twice articulated consonants. Each click consists of one of four primary articulations or "influxes" and one of five secondary articulation or "effluxes". The mix results in 20 phonemes.

The aspiration on the aspirated clicks is usually light but is 'raspier' than the aspirated nasal clicks, with a sound like the "ch" of Scottish "loch". The glottalised clicks are clearly voiceless because of the hold before the release, and they are used as simple voiceless clicks in the traditional orthography. The nasal part is not able to be heard in initial position; the voiceless nasal component of the aspirated clicks is also hard to hear when not between vowels, so to foreign ears, it may sound like a longer but less raspy version of the contour clicks.

Tindall says that European learners usually pronounce the lateral clicks by placing the tongue against the side teeth and that this way is "harsh and foreign to the native ear". The Namaqua cover the whole of the palate with the tongue and produce the sound "as far back in the palate as possible".

Lexical root words consist of two or rarely three moras, in the form CVCV(C), CVV(C), or CVN(C). (The initial consonant is required.) The middle consonant may only be "w r m n" ("w" is "b~p" and "r" is "d~t"), while the final consonant (C) may only be "p, s, ts". Each mora has tone, but the second may only be high or medium, for six tone "melodies": HH, MH, LH, HM, MM, LM.

Oral vowel lines in CVV are /ii ee aa oo uu ai [əi] ae ao au [əu] oa oe ui/. Due to the reduced number of nasal vowels, nasal lines are /ĩĩ ãã ũũ ãĩ [ə̃ĩ] ãũ [ə̃ũ] õã ũĩ/. Lines ending in a high vowel (/ii uu ai au ui ĩĩ ũũ ãĩ ãũ ũĩ/) are said quicker than others (/ee aa oo ae ao oa oe ãã õã/), more like diphthongs and long vowels than like vowel sequences in hiatus. The tones are contours. CVCV words usually have the same vowel sequences, but there are many exceptions. The two tones are also more different.

Vowel-nasal sequences are stuck to non-front vowels: /am an om on um un/. Their tones are also contours.

Grammatical particles have the form CV or CN, with any vowel or tone, where C may be any consonant but a click, and the next letter cannot be NN. Suffixes and a third mora of a root, may have the form CV, CN, V, N, with any vowel or tone; there are also three C-only suffixes, "-p" 1m.sg, "-ts" 2m.sg, "-s" 2/3f.sg.

There have been a few orthographies used for Nama. "A Khoekhoegowab dictionary" (Haacke 2000) uses the modern standard.

In standard orthography, the consonants "b d g" are used for words with one of the lower tone melodies and "p t k" for one of the higher tone melodies. "W" is only used in the middle of vowels, but it may be replaced with "b" or "p" depending on melody. Overt tone marking is otherwise generally omitted.

Nasal vowels are written with a circumflex. All nasal vowels are long, as in "hû" /hũ̀ṹ/ 'seven'. Long (double) vowels are written with a macron, as in "ā" /ʔàa̋/ 'to cry, weep'; these make two moras (two tone-bearing units).

A glottal stop is not written at the beginning of a word (where it is predictable), but it is written with a hyphen in compound words, such as "gao-aob" /kȁòʔòȁp/ 'chief'.

The clicks are written using the IPA symbols:


Sometimes other characters are used, like the hash (#) in place of ǂ.

Nama has a subject–object–verb word order, three noun classes ("masculine/gu-class, feminine/di-class" and "neuter/n-class") and three grammatical numbers ("singular, dual" and "plural"). Pronominal enclitics are used to mark person, gender, and number on the noun phrases.
The PGN (person-gender-number) markers are enclitic pronouns that get on to noun phrases. The PGN markers make a difference between first, second, and third person, masculine, feminine, and neuter gender, and singular, dual, and plural number. The PGN markers can be cut into nominative, object, and oblique paradigms.

Khoekhoe has four articles: "ti", "si", "sa", "ǁî". These articles can be combined with PGN markers.

Examples from Haacke (2013):


There are three clause markers, ge (declarative), kha (interrogative), and ko/km (assertive). These markers appear in matrix clauses, and appear after the subject.

After this is a sample text in the Khoekhoe language.

Bradyrhizobium

Bradyrhizobium is a genus of Gram-negative soil bacteria that naturally occur as free-living soil bacteria or in symbiotic relationships with legumes. "Bradyrhizobium" is known for nitrogen fixation, which converts atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia (N - NH). This process allows plants and other organisms to use organic compounds, such as nitrates, more readily. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as "Bradyrhizobium" are crucial to chemical cycles in the soil.

"Bradyrhizobium" species are Gram-negative, rod-shaped (also called bacilli) with a flagella (like a tail) to help them move through their environment. Gram-negative bacteria are smaller types of bacteria with thin cell walls that are sensitive to drought or water stress. They are commonly found in the soil where they can form relationships with plant roots such as peas, clover, and other legumes in a mutually beneficial, or symbiotic, relationship. In exchange for their nitrogen fixation, the "Bradyrhizobium" benefit from carbohydrates made by the plant. They are also common in forest soils, although these species tend not to fix nitrogen.

"Bradyrhizobium" genus comprises the following species:

Febrero Amargo is an independent documentary by Gastón Goicoechea Pérez and Agustín Lorenzo Arana. The documentary narrates the military insurrection that took place in Uruguay on February 9, 1973. It details the resistance put up by the National Navy in defense of democratic institutions, along with the speculations of the political system as well as social organizations at the time regarding the possibilities of a civil-military regime based on Communiqués 4 and 7.

The title of the documentary was taken from the book "Febrero Amargo", written by Senator Amílcar Vasconcellos in March 1973, which was republished in 2017 as part of the Uruguayan Classics Collection of the National Library.

The film was completed in January 2019, and prepared for premiere at the Punta del Este Film Festival.

Febrero Amargo focused on collecting testimony from academic historians, journalists who conducted historical research, political and union figures, as well as protagonists who lived through the period. The co-directors discarded the use of photography in order to use the historical video archive, applying Roland Barthes conception that film represents a "being there of things", as opposed to the "having been there" of photography. In other words, the aim was for the documentary to become a "time machine"..

In addition, he not only sought to "document" what happened, but also to construct and reconstruct a history experienced in the present. For this reason, it questions the traditional date of the anniversary of the 1973 civil-military coup, which is celebrated on June 27, with the dissolution of the cameras. Instead, the film states that the coup took place on February 9, 1973, when the military insurrection of the Army and the Air Force took place, and that the National Navy opposed it in defense of democratic institutions.

In 2018, we participated in a call of the Audiovisual Incentive Fund of the Municipality of Maldonado to finance the production costs of "Febrero Amargo". The film won first place and the amount of money needed to cover expenses related to filming, post-production and editing. 

It was completed in January 2019 and prepared for its premiere at the Punta del Este Film Festival. Since then, it has been screened at international film festivals in Uruguay, such as the Piriápolis International Film Festival, the Montevideo International Film Festival (MONFIC), the New DETOUR Film Festival and Atlantidoc 16 - International Documentary Film Festival.

Güzel İstanbul

Güzel İstanbul is a sculpture made of concrete, located in Yildiz Park in Istanbul, Turkey. The statue shows a naked woman and was created by an artist named Gürdal Duyar.

In 1973, the Istanbul Municipality asked artists to create 20 sculptures to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Turkish Republic. Güzel Istanbul is one of these sculptures, and it shows a naked woman to represent the city. The base of the sculpture has pictures that represent the history of Istanbul.

Originally, Güzel Istanbul was placed at Karaköy Square. But some conservative politicians and media outlets said it was offensive and wanted it taken down. In March 1974, the sculpture caused a big argument in the government. After nine days of debate, Güzel Istanbul was removed and damaged on March 18th. It was left in Karaköy Square for over a month. Eventually, on May 2nd, the statue was moved to Yildiz Park and put back up on a temporary base. It still remains in Yildiz Park today, but nobody has fixed the damage done to it.<mapframe latitude="41.02365" longitude="28.97512" zoom="18" width="264" height="270" align="right" text="The sculpture was first placed in a spot that was formed like a triangle where two roads, Bankalar Caddesi and Kemeralti Caddesi, meet." />

In 1972, the governor's office in Istanbul created a group called the Board for the Celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the Republic. The board was made to plan for the anniversary which would happen in the next year. The Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, the Istanbul Fine Arts Academy, and the State College of Fine and Applied Arts worked together to make the Fine Arts Committee. This committee was part of the Board for the Celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the Republic. The committee included Şadi Çalık, Mustafa Aslıer, and Hüseyin Gezer. They asked 50 artists to make sculptures to celebrate the anniversary. The sculptures were put in many places around Istanbul, like parks and squares.

There was not enough money to make 50 sculptures, so the number was changed to 20. The Board also made the qualifications to be a sculptor stricter. They only picked artists who lived in Istanbul and who had either won a state award or were well-known in the art world. This meant 30 artists were not able to participate. The artists that did participate included Kuzgun Acar, Tamer Başoğlu, Zerrin Bölükbaşı, Ali Teoman Germaner, Yavuz Görey, Zühtü Müritoğlu, Füsun Onur, Kamil Sonad, Nusret Suman, Seyhun Topuz and Gürdal Duyar.

The Fine Arts Committee did not tell the artists what kind of sculpture to make, so they could create something in their own unique style. The committee wanted the sculptures to be diverse and represent the different styles of sculpture in Turkey at the time. The artists were also not told where their sculptures would be placed. They could be put in a park, a square, or on the side of a road. The artists had to submit their ideas for the sculpture they wanted to make to the State Art and Sculpture Museum by 20 August 1973.

Gürdal Duyar submitted a sketch of a nude female figure which he named "Beautiful Istanbul" (Güzel Istanbul in Turkish) as his proposal. The board approved his proposal during a meeting attended by local government officials, and selected Karaköy Square as the location for the sculpture. The design and nudity of the sculpture were not considered problematic at any point during the selection process.

The sculpture is also known as Ah Güzel İstanbul ("Oh Beautiful Istanbul").

Gürdal Duyar's idea was to symbolize Istanbul through a sculpture of a naked woman whose arms were tied by a chain, which represented the defensive chain put up by the Byzantine Empire in 1453 to block the Ottoman fleet from entering the Golden Horn. The woman in the sculpture was trying to break free from the chains, which was supposed to represent the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople, which was later renamed Istanbul. Duyar explained that he associated his hometown, Istanbul, with the natural beauty of the female form.

In Duyar's final design, the female figure is depicted leaning slightly backwards with her arms wrapped behind her, and her head inclined backwards as she gazes at the sky. Her hands are bound by a chain, which is not visible from the front. The upper part of the sculpture sits on a decorated plinth adorned with reliefs of pomegranates, figs, honeysuckle, and a bee. According to Duyar, the pomegranates represent Istanbul's many legends, figs represent its divinity, honeysuckle represents its air, and the bee represents its population density, dynamism, and abundance. Apart from its historical and political significance, Duyar's work has also been interpreted as a universal representation of women's liberation. The sculpture, which used 7,000 kilograms (15,000 lb) of poured concrete, was 4.8 meters (15.7 ft) tall when it was first installed.

On March 10, 1974, Güzel İstanbul was installed in Karaköy Square, which is an open and busy area located near the northern end of Galata Bridge in Istanbul. The sculpture received a lot of attention and caused controversy. According to Ahu Antmen, the controversy was caused by the sculpture's placement in a crowded area. On the other hand, Onat Kutlar believed that the controversy was due to the sensuality or realism present in Duyar's sculptures, including Güzel İstanbul.

A media campaign against Güzel İstanbul started shortly after it was installed in Karaköy Square. For ten days, various newspapers described the sculpture as indecent and erotic. One newspaper, Sabah, even printed a front-page article on 21 March 1974 that accused the sculpture of corrupting the morals of Muslim Turks. This led to the sculpture becoming a topic of discussion in the government. Deputy-Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan called the sculpture immoral and suggested its removal on 17 March. The Minister of the Interior, Oğuzhan Asiltürk, said that the sculpture was disgraceful to Turkish mothers and should be removed. The mayor of Istanbul, Ahmet İsvan, said he disliked the sculpture because he found it tasteless, not because it was a nude. The Governor of Istanbul, Namık Kemal Şentürk, stated that he could not judge the sculpture on an artistic level, but that it had been placed in the wrong location and thus had it removed.

The controversy over Güzel İstanbul led to a heated debate, with some Republican intellectuals and others defending the sculpture and arguing for its right to remain. However, the controversy also had political implications, almost leading to the collapse of Turkey's newly formed governing coalition. The CHP, the other party in the coalition, supported the National Salvation Party's position that the sculpture was indecent in order to avoid political conflict, despite this going against their own ethical values. Some scholars, such as Hüseyin Gezer, defended the sculpture, stating that there is a difference between a naked woman and a nude sculpture.

On the night of 18 March 1974, nine days after its installation, "Güzel İstanbul" was removed from Karaköy Square. In a midnight intervention, the sculpture was broken off its base and damaged: its arm was broken off. It was removed from the park and placed on a pile of sand near the Kumkapı municipal construction site. The front page of the newspaper "Milliyet" showed a photograph of people standing on top of the empty plinth on the night the sculpture was removed, as well as the rubble resulting from the plinth's destruction. An article in the newspaper "Sabah" stated the goal of their campaign to have the sculpture removed had been accomplished. This was countered by articles in the newspapers "Milliyet" and "Cumhuriyet", which described the sculpture's right to remain as a necessity for democracy.

Some Turkish intellectuals reacted to the events. Burhan Felek criticized the removal, saying a sculpture should not be removed just because a minister does not like it, and that there is not a referendum of beliefs for every issue. Melih Cevdet Anday criticized the government for choosing what the people should and should not like. Hıfzı Veldet Velidedeoğlu stated dominance of the mentality that puts forward religious conservative traditions in the context of fine arts would regress Turkey to a desert of bigotry. "Güzel İstanbul" was also defended by cartoonists and caricaturists such as , , Nejat Uygur, , Ferruh Doğan, and , who made cartoons commenting on its removal. One of the cartoons showed those that removed the sculpture as backwards and outdated, another criticized the politicization of art, and another criticized censorship; and others asked why fake issues were being made in the news.

Cartoonists and artists who opposed the removal wanted to protesting it by covering all sculptures in Istanbul in black cloth but they cancelled their protest. The removal from Karaköy Square was seen as being against freedom of expression in art; to protest this, the Association of Turkish Sculptors organized an exhibition around the theme of nudity to show that the creative will of artists would continue. Many sculptors participated in the show, including Füsun Onur.

The debate about "Güzel İstanbul" spread beyond Istanbul; provinces Manisa and Zonguldak offered to have "Güzel İstanbul" moved to their cities. "Güzel İstanbul" was one of 20 sculptures of which many others were damaged or removed.

On 20 March 1974, the Istanbul Public Prosecutors Office, considering the articles published about the sculpture in newspapers as charges, opened an inquiry to decide whether the sculpture was obscene. According to a news report, if the sculpture was found to be obscene, the 50th Anniversary Committee would face prosecution under articles 426 and 576 of Turkish law. Mustafa Aslıer, a member of the committee, reflected on the events that led to the removal of "Güzel İstanbul"; he had been implicated in the statements and publications by the press and the MSP that led to the charges.

On 3 May 1974, through the secret intervention of Bülent Ecevit, "Güzel İstanbul" was taken to Yıldız Park and left lying on its side underneath a tree. The move ended the heated political and public debate regarding the sculpture which had lasted almost two months, although "Güzel İstanbul" was left in an poor physical condition. In the subsequent months, photographs of the sculpture lying on its side in the park appeared; several newspapers published opinion pieces — including articles by Burhan Felek and Bedi Faik — describing the sculpture being left in this state and asking why the process was disrespectful to the artwork and the artist. The statue was eventually mounted onto a new makeshift plinth without the motifs, all of which had been destroyed. , the sculpture stands in a small corner near the park's Ortaköy entrance. According to some press accounts, it has not been well maintained; parts of its concrete are crumbling and its inner structure is exposed.

Gürdal Duyar, the sculptor of "Güzel Istanbul", said little about the statue's fate and did not participate in the controversy. In 1995, Turkish journalist Nebil Özgentürk asked Duyar about the repeated removals of the artist's work. Duyar said his role as the artist was limited to creation of sculptures, adding: "Our job is making sculptures; removing, breaking or changing their location is a different area of expertise".

In 2017, the Istanbul Municipality hid the sculpture by surrounding it with a fence made of saplings after parents had complained about it being visible from a nearby playground. After news of this censorship spread, a campaign on social media criticized the censorship and succeeded in having the saplings removed.

Stabiae

Stabiae was a Ancient Roman settlement, about southwest of Pompeii. Like Pompeii, this seaside resort was largely buried by tephra ash in the 79 AD eruption of Mount Vesuvius, in this case at a smaller depth of up to five metres. It is only from Mount Vesuvius.

Stabiae is most famous for the Roman villas found near the ancient. They are some of the most stunning architectural and artistic remains from any Roman villas. They are the largest concentration of well-preserved, enormous, elite seaside villas found from the entire Roman world. The villas were on a 50 m high headland overlooking the Gulf of Naples. Although it was discovered before Pompeii in 1749, unlike Pompeii and Herculaneum, Stabiae was reburied by 1782 and so failed to establish itself as a destination for travellers on the Grand Tour.

Many of the objects and frescoes taken from these villas are now in the National Archaeological Museum of Naples.

There had already been a settlement there, before the Romans. The port of Stabiae already existed in the 6th century BC, but was much smaller than that of Pompeii. In 89 BC, Sulla descroyed much of Stabiae.Pliny the Elder repüorted that the city was rebuilt soon afterwards. According to him, it was a popular destination for wealthy Romans.

Oplontis

Oplontis is an archeological site, south of Naples. The site is localted in modern-day Torre Annunziata. Like other sites in the region, it was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. The excavated site comprises two Roman villas, the better-known of which is Villa A, the so-called Villa Poppaea.

Like the nearby towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum, Oplontis was buried in ash during the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. However, the force of the eruption was even stronger than at these cities as not only roofs collapsed, but walls and columns were broken and pieces thrown sideways.

The first villa, called villa A, or later Villa Poppea is very big and richly decorated. Domenico Fontana, descovered it in 1593 -1600 when he constructed the Sarno aqueduct. The oldest part of this villa date to around 50 BC. The villa was badly< damged in the AD 62 Pompeii earthquake, and later rebuilt. When Vesivius eruped in 79 Ad,Villa A was problably still being rebuilt. Very likely, no one lived there.

A second villa, Villa B, was discovered in 1974, east of Villa A, during the construction of a school. The villa was partially excavated until 1991.

In contrast to the sumptuously decorated Villa Poppaea, Villa B is much smaller and has buch less decoration. Villa B is a rustic, two-story structure with many rooms left unplastered and with tamped earth floors. The structure's plan reveals a central courtyard surrounded by a two-story peristyle of Nocera "tufa" columns. Nevertheless, more than seventy rooms were found on both ground and second-story levels. On the ground floor all four sides of the courtyard have barrel-vaulted rooms in "opus incertum" and "opus reticulatum".

A bronze seal bearing the name of L. Crassius Tertius was found at the site.

It was built at the end of the 2nd c. BC. The complex was part of a wider settlement built before the construction of neighbouring Villa A.

This villa was not deserted at the time of the eruption: the remains of 54 people were recovered in one of the rooms of the villa. Therse people died in the surge that hit Oplontis. They were split into two groups, one group with fine jewellery, silverware, and coins and another one without. 

Recent archaeology has shown that it suffered unique type of destruction because of its proximity to the sea, different from Pompeii or Herculaneum. The volcanic eruption generated a pyroclastic flow that sped down the mountain toward Oplontis. The impact of the flow on the sea surface led to a type of ""tsunami"" which caused the violent entry and deposition of a water-heavy layer in the barrel-vaulted rooms (similar to the deposit that buried the skeletons on the shore of Herculaneum). The people sheltering at Oplontis died beneath a mixed mass of superheated gas, ash, and water. The impact of the wave probably also caused the collapse of the barrel-vaults.

Some of the rooms seem to have been used for manufacturing, and others were storerooms, while the upper floor contained the living quarters of the house. These circumstances, along with more than 400 "amphorae" recovered in the excavations, indicate the property was devoted to the production of wine, oil, and agricultural goods. The discovery of a series of weights seems to confirm this; a bronze seal found at the site preserved the name of "Lucius Crassius Tertius". This was probably its last owner.

The southern part of the upper floor is perhaps the owner's living quarters, as some rooms are decorated with paintings in the "Fourth Style", and there is also a rare example of a second style painting from the Republican era.

A rare very ornate strongbox was found in the peristyle, perhaps fallen from the upper floor, containing over 200 coins, jewellery, and a seal ring. It was finely decorated with inlay in silver, copper, and gilded bronze typical of late Hellenistic design, and it had a complex locking system that was still used in the 19th century.

A sophisticated water drainage system was added late in the villa's history. At the north of the site the ground floor rooms were reconfigured and the street repaved.

Theloderma

Theloderma, the bug-eyed frogs, mossy frogs, or warty frogs, is a genus of frogs in the family Rhacophoridae, subfamily Rhacophorinae. They live in northeastern India and southern China, through Southeast Asia, to the Greater Sunda Islands; the highest species richness is in Indochina. Some species, especially "T. corticale", can live in captivity, with humans.

They are small and medium-sized frogs with maximum snout–vent lengths that range from . Their skin can be smooth or it can have warts or bumps on it. Some of the species look very different from each other, but most have good camouflage: Their colors make them look like plants or bird droppings so that animals that want to eat them cannot see them.

Scientists do not know much about what these frogs do, but they eat small animals without bones, for example insects. Scientists have seen some of these species lay eggs in small pools of water in holes in trees, in bamboo, or in karst rocks. The female lays 4–20 eggs just above the water. After about one to two weeks they hatch into tadpoles that fall into the water. They become small frogs after a few months or a year.

The sister taxon of "Theloderma" is "Nyctixalus". Scientists have changed their minds about exactly which species should be in the genus "Theloderma" and which in "Nyctixalus", especially with "Theloderma moloch". Today both AmphibiaWeb and Amphibian Species of the World say the two genera are both good.

Amphibian Species of the World says there are 26 species in the genus "Theloderma":

The separation between the binary systems Castor A and Castor B has increased from about 2″ (2 arcseconds of angular measurement) in 1970 to about 6″ in 2017.

Castor Aa and Ba both have orbits of a few days with a much fainter star.

Castor C, or YY Geminorum, was discovered to change in brightness with a regular period. It is an eclipsing binary with additional changes due to areas of different brightness on the surface of one or both stars, as well as irregular flares. The Castor C stars orbit in less than a day. Castor C is believed to be in a orbit around Castor AB, but with an extremely long period of several thousand years. It is 73″ distant from the bright stars in the system

The combined apparent magnitude of all six stars is +1.58.

Imperial anthems of the Ottoman Empire

The Ottoman Empire used to have a different anthem for each ruler. The first Sultan that appeared to have a personal anthem was Mahmud II. He started reforms which included the modernization of Ottoman imperial and military bands. This process went to Italian-born composer Giuseppe Donizetti, who was also the composer of first Ottoman Imperial anthem – "Mahmudiye Marşı", and second – "Mecidyie Marşi".

Hoogland is known for its farms and the people living there being close together. Every year, a festival is held so that people have the chance to chat and catch up with each other. It also entertains people and is known for it's horse races. Thousand of people visit this event every year,

Jörn Bjerregaard

Jörn Bjerregaard (born 19 January 1943) is a retired Danish footballer and coach.
He started his career at Aarhus GF at the age of 12. Aarhus was Denmark's top team in the 1950s. In addition to football, he began studying economics, which he ended prematurely in the mid-1960s in favor of sports. In 1962 he made his debut for Aarhus in the first Danish league. He scored 13 goals in his first season. This made him to the club's second-best goalscorer. In 1965, Bjerregaard won his first title by winning the cup. 

1966 he went to Austria and signed a contract with SK Rapid Wien. This was his first professional contract, since a professional league was not introduced in Denmark until 1978. In his first game for Rapid he scored three goals against Kapfenberger SV and three in the first round of the European Cup against Galatasaray Istanbul.

In the 1971/72 season he had problems with the new coach Ernst Hlozek. So he went to SC Eisenstadt. After 23 goals in his first season for Eisenstadt, he played as midfielder the following year . At the age of 32 he ended his career as defender. The reason for the end of his career was physical problems.
Between 1962 and 1966 he played five matches for the Danish U-21 national team. Bjerregaard never played in an official game for the Danish national football team. He became a professional player when he switched to Rapid and Denmark was an amateur team.
In 1976, Bjerregaard became coach of his first club Aarhus GF. In this season Aarhus was promoted to the 1st division After this resigned and returned to Austria. 
Bjerregaard's son, Carsten Bjerregaard, was also a professional footballer. He played for Vienna and Admira Wacker in the Austrian Bundesliga between 1990 and 1995.

Quaternary numeral system

A quaternary numeral system uses the digits 0, 1, 2, and 3 to represent any real number. It is a base-4 system, which means it works in a similar way to how we count in regular decimal numbers, but with only four possible digits. Converting from binary (a base-2 system) to quaternary is easy.

The number four is a useful choice for a base in counting because it is the highest number that can be quickly recognized without counting each item one by one (subitizing). It is also both a square number and a highly composite number (in the same way 36 is), making it quite easy. Despite being twice as large as binary, it has the same radix economy for counting. However, it is not the best choice for identifying prime numbers (the smallest better choice being the primorial base six, or senary).

Quaternary is like other numeral systems with a fixed-radix in that it has certain properties, such as the capability to represent any real number using a standard representation that is almost unique. Additionally, it has similar characteristics for the representation of irrational and rational numbers as systems like decimal or binary. See discussions on binary and decimal for more information on these properties.

TRAPPIST-1d

TRAPPIST-1d, also known as 2MASS J23062928-0502285 d, is a small exoplanet which is about 40% the mass of the Earth. It orbits on the inner edge of the habitable zone of the ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1. It is located 40.7 light years away from Earth in the constellation of Aquarius. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method, which means the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. The first information about the planet were announced in 2016, but it wasn't until the following years that more information about the likely nature of the planet was obtained. TRAPPIST-1d is the second-least massive planet of the TRAPPIST-1 system and is likely to have a thin hydrogen-poor atmosphere that is closely packed together similar to Venus, Earth, or Mars. It gets just 4.3% more sunlight than how much sunlight the Earth gets from the sun, placing it on the inner edge of the habitable zone. It has about less than 5% of its mass as a volatile layer, which could consist of atmosphere, oceans, and/or ice layers. A 2018 study by the University of Washington came to a opinion that TRAPPIST-1d might be a Venus-like exoplanet with an uninhabitable atmosphere. The planet is an eyeball planet candidate.

In 1987 in Milano, Mario Schifano aroused the enthusiasm and emotion of the public for the "No title" art work that represent a palm.
The work aims to be a denunciation of environmental protection and an awareness of sustainability inspired by the principles of advertising.
The painting executed in the mid eighty, represents the typical figure of a palm tree, with the red, white and green colors of the Italian flag, enriched by pink which is one of the most precious colors of Schifano. Schifano with Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein is considered the founder of pop art.

This work is registered in the Archivio Monica Schifano, Mario Schifano's wife, and the only authorized official archive by sentences of the Italian judiciary.

After returning from the USA, he rediscovers the techniques of the past with brilliant enamel, and rediscovers the figuration of the past, landscape and geometry, but the enamel is less juicy, the landscape, as the titles say, is an "anemic" landscape, but wants to contrast any impressionist interpretation

In Schifano's work we perceive the link between nature and technology, and the characterization of the materiality of color which gives the surface a highly elegant path and rhythm.

Mario Schifano was the most relevant exponent of the Italian art movement which, in the early 60s, anticipated the concepts of American Pop Art. "Schifano starts from the zeroing of the image to move on to a new figuration, thus focusing once again on the very meaning of painting. “I want to paint while painting” Schifano said in those days. Starting from his first monochromes, by resetting the degree of the pictorial gesture, he will turn towards the addition of enlarged images. Schifano transforms the canvas into a screen where he projects the images that are selected from his own memory. He isolates them, frames them, dilates them, imprints them on that film which has now become the surface of the picture. “This idea that the canvas is nothing but a support, a sort of place of memory, guides Schifano throughout his future journey".

Schifano passes to new pictorial images where he finds the representation of nature. Especially the latter is introduced in his "anemic landscapes" of 1963, where memory, through allusive phrases, rapid gestures and details, becomes the voice of the representation of nature itself. This will then further evolve in the series Trees, Oxygen Oxygen, Oasis, and imagination above all in the depiction of the Palm, where it finds its most complete maturity and where the artist carries forward his idea of ​​the painting and its function as a screen. It also alludes to the protection of the environment, in times when it was not lived like today, and it alludes to a human and cultural problem, representing the theme of escape, where to rediscover the soul. The escape from this solitude of the tree as an individual without roots, the escape from a way of building one's present through a rigid series of values, Schifano, in these paintings where the dream evidently begins to appear, the moment of detachment from reality, where the continuum of perspective space […] tends to fracture, Schifano begins to analytically dissociate the image”<ref>AA.VV. , Mario Schifano, Parma, 1974/ref>, it presents itself as a complete manifesto of his cultured art at a key moment.

Sickness benefit

Sickness benefit was part of the Social Security system in the United Kingdom. It started with the National Insurance Act 1911. People had to get a sick note and they had to have paid enough National Insurance Contributions. It lasted for six months. After that people got Invalidity Benefit if they were still ill. That was more money. 

After 1983 most people got Statutory Sick Pay from their work for the first 8 weeks they were ill instead of sickness benefit. From 1986 Statutory Sick Pay lasted for 28 weeks, so people didn't get sickness benefit unless they couldn't get Statutory Sick Pay. 

In 1948 it was 26 shillings a week, but married women only got 16 shillings because they were expected to rely on their husband for money. In 1987 it was £30.05 a week for both men and women.

Messier 80

Messier 80 (also known as M80 or NGC 6093) is a globular cluster located 32,620 light years away in the constellation Scorpius, it was discovered by Charles Messier in 1781, it was also one of his first discoveries.
M80 can be seen in a field of the Milky Way that has many nebulae. It is located between Antares and Beta Scorpii when looking from Earth. With less light pollution, it can be seen as a round patch of light with a small telescope below the 67th parallel north.

It one of the densest globular cluster in the Milky Way. It is at twice the distance of the Galactic Center in regions known as the Galactic halo. It contains many hundred thousand stars and has an apparent angular diameter of 10 arcminutes. It is 32,600 light years away, making its true diameter around 95 light years.

M80 contains a lot of blue stragglers. Blue stragglers are stars that seem younger than the rest. It is thought that this is because they lost some layers due to encounters or collisions with other stars in the dense cluster. With the help of the Hubble Space Telescope, images reveal many of these stragglers in the center of the cluster, suggesting a high rate of capture and collisions.

On May 21, 1860, a nova was found in M80 that had an magnitude of +7.0 and was possible to see it using telescopes, binoculars and people with good vision. This variable star, named T Scorpii, reached an absolute magnitude of −8.5 and briefly shone brighter than the cluster.

Scandic Hotels

Scandic Hotels is a company that owns and manages hotels. It is based in Stockholm, Sweden, and mostly operates in countries like Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark. They also have hotels in Germany and Poland. As of the end of 2018, the company had 11,560 employees and ran 283 hotels with 51,693 rooms for guests. They have been committed to being environmentally friendly since 1994.

The first hotel that started the Scandic chain was called Esso Motor Hotel. It opened in 1963 in Laxå, Sweden, and was popular because people were traveling more by car. The chain grew to 59 hotels in Europe by 1972. Esso then sold the hotels outside of Scandinavia, and the remaining 32 hotels, including five in Norway and Denmark, became the biggest hotel chain in Sweden in 1973.

In 1983, a Swedish group led by Ratos bought the company and named it Scandic Hotels. Ratos became the sole owner in 1985. In 1986, they opened their first hotel outside Scandinavia in Germany.

During the Gulf Crisis in 1990/91, the business was affected, and new management took over in 1992. In 1996, they bought Reso Hotels and became a publicly traded company. They expanded into Finland and Estonia in the following years.

In 2001, Scandic Hotels was bought by the Hilton Group, which is based in London. Then, in 2007, a Swedish company called EQT purchased the hotel chain for 833 million euros. In July 2013, Scandic Hotels teamed up with Swiss Hospitality to improve its digital systems. In 2014, Scandic Hotels acquired the Rica Hotels chain, which included 72 hotels in Norway and Sweden.

In December 2015, Scandic Hotels went back on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.

In 2014, Scandic Hotels introduced a new brand called HTL hotels, but in June 2016, they stopped using it and turned the four hotels in Stockholm and Oslo back into Scandic Hotels. In 2017, Scandic Hotels bought 43 Restel hotels in Finland, including Cumulus and Holiday Inn, for 114.5 million euros.

In March 2020, due to the Coronavirus pandemic, many Scandic employees were laid off. By April of that year, Scandic Hotels had a very low occupancy rate of only six percent, which caused them to lose over six billion in 2020.

By the end of 2018, the company had 11,560 employees and ran 283 hotels with 51,693 rooms for guests. In 2018, they made a profit of SEK 1,957 million.

Scandic Hotels has been committed to being environmentally friendly since 1994. They teach their employees about sustainability and have eco-friendly rooms. In 2001, their breakfasts in Swedish hotels received a special ecological certificate, and by 2004, all Swedish hotels had earned the "Swan" ecolabel.

Since 2015, Scandic Hotels has aligned with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. They have teamed up with Too Good To Go and Karma to reduce food waste in their hotels.

Bernard D. Beitman

Bernard D. Beitman (born 1942) is a professor of psychiatry. At present time he is Founder and President of The Coincidence Project. He works as a private practitioner in psychiatry. He was the head of the psychiatry department at University of Missouri, Columbia. He has authored a number of books on psychology and related topics.

Beitman also has experiences in sports, such as Rugby. Since the early to mid 1970s, Beitman began to be fascinated on the subject of coincidences and has psychologically studied them. He became fascinated with them after experiencing one in 1973.

He has also began writing books on the same subject. His continuing research on coincidences includes launching a project called "the coincidence project." His research is not "completed" and he is continuing it and has also included publishing psychological papers on coincidence.

He also studied at Yale University and Stanford.

Beitman also coined the term simulpathity from his research into coincidence. Simulpathity is a coincidence in which an individual feels the pain or suffering of a loved one. In 1973, Bietman claims he experienced chocking despite having no objects in his throat. The next day, he was informed by his brother that his father, who was living on the other side of America, was chocking on his own blood and died. Beitman learned the timing of his fathers fatal chocking was occurring the same time as his, despite being thousands of miles apart.

He and his coincidental experiences have also been inspired by the works of Swiss psychiatrist, Carl Jung.

This coincidence then set him off on a curious mission to try and better understand the phenomenon. His research of interest in this topic is equally shared by other researchers.


Zangbeto

The traditional voodoo night guards among the Ogu (or Egun) people of Benin, Togo, and Nigeria are called Zangbeto. The Zangbeto cult, a traditional police and security group, is in charge of keeping law and order and ensuring safety and security in Ogu communities. 

They are much respected and serve as an unofficial police force, patrolling the streets, particularly at night, keeping an eye on residents and their possessions, looking out for offenders, and bringing them before the community for punishment. Zangbeto, who was originally meant to scare away the adversary, will patrol the streets looking for thieves and witches while defending law and order. 

Zangbeto is a term in the Gun language that means "Men of the night" or "Night-watchmen," relating to its basic cultural role in neighborhood vigilantism and neighborhood policing in Ogu cultures. The Zangbeto appears in a multilayered pattern of teeny-tiny ropes of hay, raffia, or other threadlike materials, which are occasionally dyed in vibrant colors. 

They have the capacity to enter trances during which, according to belief, spirits with specialized understanding of human behavior can inhabit their bodies. However, Ogu legend tells that there are no humans under the costume, only spirits of the night.

Ancient Celtic religion

Ancient Celtic religion or Celtic paganism was followed by the Celtic people in Europe long ago. 

Since there aren't written records of their beliefs, we learn about them from what they left behind. The Celts believed in many gods and goddesses, and their religion was similar across different regions. and "a basic religious homogeneity" among the Celtic peoples. Some popular deities were Lugus, Toutatis, Taranis, Cernunnos, Epona, Maponos, Belenus, Ogmios, and Sucellos. They also believed in spirits in nature.

The priests of the Celtic religion were called druids, but we don't know much about them. The Celts held ceremonies in special places like groves and shrines. Caesar says the Gauls believed they all descended from a god of the dead and underworld. They made offerings of valuable items in water or wells. They sometimes sacrificed animals, and there are stories of human sacrifice, but it might be exaggerated.

We don't know all the festivals they celebrated, but they had four important ones during different seasons. After the Romans took over Gaul and southern Britain, the Celtic religion mixed with Roman ideas. Later, the Celts started following Christianity, and their old religion faded. However, Celtic mythology and beliefs had a lasting influence and inspired a modern religious movement called Celtic neopaganism. Therefore, all there is to study their religion from is the literature from the early Christian period, commentaries from classical Greek and Roman scholars, and archaeological evidence.

Egypt–Israel peace treaty

The Egypt–Israel peace treaty was a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. It was signed by both countries in 1979, at the end of the Camp David Accords. It was the first treaty between a Middle-Eastern Arab nation and Israel. After signing it, Egypt was removed from the Arab League.

The Egypt–Israel treaty was signed by Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin, and witnessed by United States president Jimmy Carter.

In 1947, the United Nations announced the Partition Plan for Palestine, which planned to divide Mandatory Palestine into different parts for Arabs and Jews. Many people were unhappy with this solution, and so a civil war broke out between the different religious communities.

When the British Mandate of Palestine ended and the State of Israel was founded on May 14, 1948, some Arab countries that were part of the Arab League attacked the young country. Among them were Syria, Egypt, and Jordan. Many believed it had been built on Palestinian territory without permission.

The Arab-Israeli War ended with Israeli victory in January 1949, and more than 18,000 people died in the many clashes. In Israel, the war is called "War of Independence", while Palestinians often call it "Nakba", which means catastrophe. More than 750,000 Palestinians were forced to leave their homes and lost everything. Today, there are more than 7 million Palestinian refugees in the world.

In the early 1950s, Egypt's president Gamal Abdel Nasser and his government planned to build a new dam in the country. They needed money, which they hoped to get from other countries. However, the United States and Great Britain did not support this project because of Egypt's connections to communist countries.

Nasser then decided to nationalise the Suez Canal in 1956 to earn profits from tolls. Britain and France, the countries that owned the Suez Company, were unhappy with this decision: they were afraid to lose control and to be cut off from the oil supply. They allied with Israel, whose government wanted to use the canal as well but couldn't because of continuous tensions.

On October 29, 1956, the Israeli army invaded Egypt and gained control of Gaza. Britain and France then demanded a ceasefire as planned, and their troops occupied the canal in November.

This conflict happened during the Cold War. To avoid a conflict between the East and the West, the UN, the United States of America, and the Soviet Union urged all foreign troops to leave Egypt. British and French forces left in December, but Israel occupied the area until March 1957.

The European powers lost control in the region, while the Soviet Union gained influence in many Middle-Eastern countries. President Nasser and Egypt were the winners in this war, and this led to stronger feelings of nationalism in the region.

The different wars and continuing conflict between Israel and Egypt led to the Six-Day War on June 5, 1967. Israel attacked Egyptian positions in the air and on land. The soldiers captured the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, the West Bank, and the Golan Heights, and took control of the whole city of Jerusalem on June 7. This was especially important because Jerusalem as a holy city represented an important symbol for religion and nationalism.

The war lasted six days, until June 10, 1967. More than 20,000 Egyptian and 800 Israeli soldiers died in the battles. Because of Israel's victory and expansions, President Nasser resigned but soon returned to office. The war and Israel's new territories made the conflict worse.

The Yom-Kippur War began during the festivities of Yom Kippur and Ramadan, which are holy periods in Judaism and Islam. On October 6, 1973, Egypt and Syria attacked the territories Israel had won during the Six-Day War. Their forces quickly conquered the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. Because of the holiday, the Israeli army was not prepared. When Israel reacted, it took back control over the territories, and moved into Egypt and Syria.

The United States of America were on Israel's side and supplied weapons, while Egypt and Syria were supported by the Soviet Union. This proxy war was dangerous, because it could have led to a conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. On October 25, 1973, the war ended with a ceasefire.

The Camp David Accords were the agreements made after the secret Camp David talks at the President of the United States' country retreat on September 17, 1978. The talks between Israel and Egypt lasted 12 days, until both sides agreed on certain terms. President Carter was a leading force for the agreements, and these accords led to the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty in 1979.

After Gamal Abdel Nasser's death, Anwar Sadat became president, and Egypt's nationalist and Pan-Arabist politics changed. Sadat wanted to sign a peace treaty with Israel. After the Yom-Kippur War of 1973, he first made a state visit to Israel and officially recognised the country. Then, encouraged by the United States and Jimmy Carter, both sides secretly met at Camp David. 

The first agreement focused on "A Framework for Peace in the Middle East", which was supposed to end the conflict between Israel and its neighbours. It also tried include the Palestinian problem. However, the agreement failed, because both parties, Egypt and Israel, interpreted it differently. It did not answer the Palestinian question and created room for conflict.

The second agreement focused on "A Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel", stating that the signing countries would enter a peace treaty with each other. This also meant that Egypt would receive back its lands in the Sinai Peninsula, but the country had to partially demilitarise. Israel would be allowed to use the Suez Canal. The agreement made sure the countries recognised each other.

These talks at Camp David made the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty possible. The Egyptian people were happy because they hoped that these agreements would help their country's economy. Egypt's tourism flourished, and both sides became trading partners in the following years. But because the problem of Palestinian autonomy had not been solved, many, especially in Israel, believed the conflict would continue.

On March 26, 1979, Egypt's president Anwar Sadat and Israel's prime minister Menachem Begin signed a peace treaty at the White House in Washington, D.C.. The President of the United States, Jimmy Carter, was also present. He had helped the relations between the countries. The treaty ended the war between Egypt and Israel. It included an agreement to end the conflict and three major points: the determination of final lines and zones, a promise of good relations between the two countries, and the problem of Palestinian autonomy. However, the problem of Palestinian autonomy remained unanswered.

The Sinai Peninsula was divided into four zones, A, B, C, and D.

Zones A, B, and a part of Zone C were controlled by Egypt. Here, 22,000 soldiers and 248 tanks could be stationed. The rest of Zone C was under the control of the United Nations. Zone D was controlled by Israel, and could contain up to 4,000 personnel.

The problem of Palestinian autonomy was not solved with the peace treaty. Egypt and Israel agreed that Palestinians would become independent when a "self-governing authority has been freely elected". This meant that the Palestinian fate was still not secured.

Because Egypt signed the peace treaty, the most powerful Arab state had left the Arab-Israeli conflict. As the strongest among them was no longer fighting, many Arab states ended their active fight for Palestinian independence.

The peace treaty officially ended the war between Israel and Egypt, the first Arab country to officially recognise Israel.

Israel agreed to removed its armed forces from the Sinai Peninsula. In return, Egypt gave the country free access to the Suez Canal, and agreed to build good relations with Israel. Egypt also started receiving several billions of US-dollars from the United States for military goods and the economy.

The peace treaty meant Egypt officially recognised Israel. Because of this, many Arab countries doubted if Egypt was still fighting for the Palestinian cause. By April 1979, nine Arab countries did not have diplomatic relations to the country.

Several Arab countries also sanctioned Egypt, stopped economic aid to the country, and boycotted Egyptian goods. Egypt was suspended from the Arab League, and the organisation's headquarters were moved out of the country. 10 years later, in 1989, the country became a member of the Arab League again. The peace treaty formally ended the conflict between Egypt and Israel. There have been no wars between the countries since 1979. This has led to a decrease of military spending in Egypt. Since signing the treaty, Egypt and Israel have become trade partners. 

For their role in making peace between their countries, Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978. Sadat was later assassinated in 1981 by Egyptian soldiers, who saw the treaty as an act of betrayal.

Middle Eastern music

Middle Eastern music is a form of art created in the region named Middle East. Rhythm is key in the Middle East, think about Quranic texts, prayercalls, and everyday conversations. Its characteristics are the use of quarter tones and the lack of chords. Middle Eastern music uses a lot of different instruments. A characterizing instrument is the qanun, a zither instrument. Other instruments are the oud, and the saz, both string instruments, similar to a guitar. 

These musical terms will come often in this page. A short guide with definitions of these terms could be useful. 

Scale = a collection or group of musical notes that are organized in a specific order. It gives music its characteristic sound in a particular culture.

Mode = a collection of notes that are related to a central note, and together they create a specific type or style of music. They determine the rules and conditions for playins this music.Rhythm = Arrangement of sounds and pauses that form a song's beat. It sets the pace and makes you feel the groove. It controls the length and timing of each sound.

Beat = The basic unit of time in music. A constant, regular pulse that repeats throughout a piece.

Musical tone = A steady periodic sound.

Pitch = The position of a sound in the full range of sounds. How high or low a sound is.

Chords = combination of three or more notes, with a harmonic pitch.

Instrument = Anything that is used to produce a musical sound.

Genre = Category that groups music together based on shared traditions and conventions.

The main religion in the Middle East is Islam. There is very little ceremonial music as music is seen as problematic in Islam. Rhythms are used for to recite the Qu'ran but not music itself. Rhythmic modes are used in Islamic music, these modes are called "īqāʿāt in Arabic." Folk music and art music are similar and common in the Middle East.

Music was already known in the pre-islamic society. Musicians at that time had a high rank in society. The Muezzin is the person that calls for the daily prayers. Prophet Muhammad would ask the Muezzin to do a call for prayers as his soothing voice was comforting. During the time of the Prophet, music was not tolerated but recitation and rhythm were commonly used. Many musicians appeared during the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates. Culture was exchanged: Arabs, Persians, Turks and Byzantines were coming together through music and creating new styles and forms. Later, the Islamic Empire grew even bigger. This led to more musical exchanges in Asia, Europe, Africa and Byzantium. 

Arab music became more and more popular over time. Today, Arab music is considered as one of the richest and most unique musical traditions. The music reflects historical interactions with various genres and types. Middle Eastern musicians continue impressing the world with their musical talent.

Turkish music is a form of art created in Turkey. It was formed through Central Asian Turkic people, the Ottoman Empire and modern Western music.

The music from Turkey is different from the music from other Middle Eastern countries. When you explore the heart of Turkish music, you will find two main genres: classical and folk music. The key elements of Turkish music include being experimental, melodic, and easy to understand.

Turkish music is characterized by unique scales and rhytmic patterns. Just like Middle Eastern music, Turkish music also uses a lot of instruments. The instruments are the oud, the saz, the ney (type of flute), the kemenche (string instrument that is bowed), and the darbuka (a type of hand-drum). 

Turkish classical music is called "Klasik Türk Musikisi" in Turkish. It is a genre on its own under Turkish music. It has the human voice as its basis. The classical music of Turkey is based on a scale. This scale has seven notes and a specific pattern of breaks between each note. This system of notes and breaks is called "makam" in Turkish, which is essential for Turkish classical music. There are different "makamlar" (plural of "makam") and they each have their own set of rules. The scale covers a wide range of musical pitches, because of the wide range of high and low notes. This wide range of high and low notes is referred to as "two and a half octaves" in the music world. Also important is singing. Skilled vocalists, which are called "sanatkar", are known for their ability to give rise to emotions of the lyrics.

Reading about Turkish Classical music is helpful, but hearing it can be too. Clicking on the name of the video will give a chance to listern to Turkish Classical music. The video is called "Yaşar Kurt - Yaz Günleri".

Turkish pop music was born in the 1950's. It started with the making of covers of popular styles from other countries. "Hafif-batı" means "light western" and refers to these imported songs. Later, Turkish artists began writing their own songs and develop their own style.

Turkish pop music has been influenced by the West, yet it continues to promote national values. Turkish ordinary music is said to be multicultural as it mixes Western cultures with Eastern cultures. Turkish pop songs promote modern sounds as well as traditional sounds. Names that are big in this genre are: "Tarkan, Hadise, Aleyna Tilki" and "Mustafa Sandal".

Reading about Turkish Pop music is helpful, but hearing it can be too. Clicking on the name of the video will give a chance to listen to Turkish pop music. The video is called "Mustafa Sandal - Araba".

Turkish Rock is also known as "Anatolian Rock". This is a genre under Turkish music. This genre is a mix of Turkish folk music and Western rock. Atatürk, founding father of Turkey, wanted to make Turkey more like the West (more European and American). Thus, music also became more like that of the West, but still with some Ottoman elements. It combines Turkish and Western elements in language, instruments, rhythm, melody, and harmony. Seen as Western elements, instruments like the electric guitar, bass guitar and drums are used. Names that are big in this genre are: "Barış Manço, Erkin Koray" and "Selda Bağcan."

Reading about Turkish Rock music is helpful, but hearing it can be too. Clicking on the name of the video will give a chance to listen to Turkish Rock music. The video is from one of the artists mentioned above, "Barış Manço." The video is called "Barış Manço - Dönence (1982-TRT)".

History of Kurds

The Kurds are an Iranian ethnic group in the Middle East. They live in the mountainous areas to the south of Lake Van and Lake Urmia, a geographical area collectively referred to as Kurdistan. Most Kurds speak Northern Kurdish Kurmanji and Central Kurdish (Sorani).

The Shaddadids were a Kurdish dynasty that ruled in Armenia and Arran between 951 and 1174. It was between the Kura and Araxes rivers. They dominated a large part of the Caucasus until the Seljuk ruler Toghrul came to the region.The dynasty was first established in Dvin, and it also dominated Barda and Ganja. The Shaddadis army organized expeditions against the Bagratuni dynasty and the Khazars from 1020 onwards. Fadl I successful in the beginning, but on his way back from a successful campaign in 1030, he met Georgian and Armenian forces and was defeated. They fought against the Byzantine army between 1047 and 1057. Then the influence of the Shaddadis in the region dwindled. From 1067 onwards, the Shaddadis dynasty was occupied by the Seljuks. It continued as a dependent dynasty until 1174. The cities of Ani and Tbilisi were given as gifts due to his service to the Seljuks.

Originally of Azdi Arab descent, the Rawadids ruled Tabriz and northeastern Adharbayjan in the late 8th and early 9th centuries.

The Marwanids were a Kurdish dynasty in the Diyar Bakr region of Upper Mesopotamia and Armenia. The founder of the Marwanids, Bad or Baz was a shepherd, took up arms and became a war chief. He was popular. From the middle of the tenth century he made conquests in Eastern Anatolia. He first came from the south and took Erciş and the fortified positions around it. Baz strengthening his influence, captured Diyarbakir (Amid) and Silvan and Nusaybin, which were under the control of the Buyids.

In 984 he defeated Samsam al-Dawla, the sultan of the Buyids, and captured Mosul. Although he wanted to take Baghdad, he failed and had to leave Mosul. In 991, Baz, who tried to capture Mosul again, was defeated by the Hamdanids, the rulers of the city, and died in this battle. His sister's son Abu Ali Hasan ibn Marwan ascended the throne in 990. Marwan made Mayyafariqin (Silvan) his capital. He continued to fight against the Hamdanids and defeated them twice. When Hasan ibn Marwan was assassinated in Diyarbakır in 997, he was replaced by his brother Said ibn Marwan. The Marwanid dynasty, enjoyed considerable economic and cultural prosperity, but the Kurdish languagedoesnot appear. In 1085, the Seljuk army captured most of the region after a fierce battle.

Volkswagen emissions scandal

The 2016 Volkswagen’s Dieselgate scandal involves the car brand Volkswagen. The United States Environmental Protection Agency found a program which was intentionally put in Volkswagen vehicles that made their Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) engines to activate emissions controls only during laboratory emissions testing, which caused the vehicle to meet US standards only during testing. The vehicles ended up emitting 40 times more emissions in real world driving conditions than in the lab. This caused Volkswagen (and it’s sub-brands such as Audi and Skoda), to recall 11 million cars altogether worldwide which were produced within the years of 2009-2015 that had their Diesel engines equipped.

Since 2006, it has been made available for a short time each year where it is sold during the fall season, although it is a permanent menu item at McDonald's restaurants in Germany and Luxembourg. It was reintroduced again in late 2023 to some stores in the United States.

1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ⋯

In mathematics, 1 − 2 + 3 − 4 + ··· is an infinite series.Using sigma summation notation the sum of the first "m" terms of the series can be expressed asformula_1

The series' terms do not approach 0; therefore diverges by the term test. Divergence can also be shown directly from the definition: an infinite series converges if and only if the sequence of partial sums converges to limit, in which case that limit is the value of the infinite series. The partial sums of are:

The sequence of partial sums shows that the series does not converge to a particular number: for any proposed limit "x", there exists a point beyond which the subsequent partial sums are all outside the interval ), so diverges.

Since the terms follow a simple pattern, the series can be manipulated by shifting and term-by-term addition to yield a numerical value. If it can make sense to write for some ordinary number "s", the following manipulations argue for formula_2So formula_3.

Middle Eastern and North African cinema

Middle Eastern and North African Cinema is a term for the movie productions that have taken place in any of the Middle East and North African countries. 

In the 19th Century, the region was divided between France and the United Kingdom. They had claimed protection over the countries through agreements and deals made between them (ie. Sykes-Picot Agreement). Because these countries did not have control over their economies and their political structures it was very hard to build national film industries. Only European movies were available. Culture was also repressed, especially in the French-protected countries, which made it even harder to produce films. 

The Lumière Brothers were the first film producers to present a movie to audiences in the region. They screened a movie for a selected audience in Egypt in Cairo and Alexandria. In 1896 the first movie exhibition took place within the Ottoman Empire, in Istanbul. After the success of the first screenings, in 1897 screenings took place in cities at Algeria (Algiers, Oran), at Tunisia (Tunis), at the Moroccan royal palace Fez. In 1900 screenings were taking place at Jerusalem in the Europa Hotel. All the movies that were shown were only addressing the tastes of the European colonizers. Watching movies as a form of entertainment was directed towards Europeans. There was no representation of the local cultures and there were no moves to make movies more approachable to locals. 

Cinemas, also known as movie theaters, were soon built. The first was built in 1896 in Algiers and, shortly after, the Lumière Brothers built the "Cinematographé Lumière" in Alexandria. Between 1906 and 1908 the French movie company built cinemas in Cairo and Alexandria, and in Tunis. The first cinemas, like the first screenings of movies, were not addressed towards the native people. Egypt was the first country in which movies had voice-overs in Arabic allowing native audiences to watch as well. While cinema, as a form of entertainment, was widely accepted in North Africa, in much of the Arabian Peninsula it was not because of religious reasons. 

Similarly to the first cinemas, the first movie productions were also in the hands of foreigners, mostly Europeans. Algeria, Egypt, and Palestine (specifically Jerusalem) attracted many European film producers who shot movies in what they called the "Orient." The Lumière company and Thomas Edison were some of the production companies that shot movies there. 

Those film productions were dominated by Westerners. Not only were they not made for natives, but they also included very few natives in the production processes. This was not the case for the Ottoman empire. In 1911 the , who were of Balkan origins and Ottoman citizens, filmed the journey of Sultan Reşat Mehmet to different cities in Macedonia. 

Egypt was the first colonized country to develop a national film industry. Already in 1909, the funeral of was filmed by an Egyptian person, and by 1920 Egyptian actors and actresses were already given main parts in movies, as well as directorial roles.

The 1920s were important for the development of film industries in Middle East, and especially North Africa. Egypt became the center of the local film industry. Many popular short and long films were filmed in Egypt, and production companies collaborated with Egyptian actors, cameramen, and directors. is a short movie produced by Bonvelli in 1920. It is one of the first to have an Egyptian actor play an important role. In 1921, the film "The Country of Tutankhamun" (في بلاد توت عنخ أمون) was produced by an Egyptian cameraman, Muhammad Bayyumi. In 1927 the first full-length silent film, "Layla", was made in Egypt and it was fully produced by a native woman, Aziza Amir, who also played the female leading role. In Egypt, in 1928, there were two full length films produced, more than other countries in the region at the time. Opinions regarding who directed "Layla" differ. What is known for sure is that Aziza Amir was the producer and the owner of her own production company "Isis Films". In the beginning, it seems like the movie was to be directed by Wedad Orfi, who was the leading male actor; however, the movie was at the end directed by another man, Stephane Rosti. It is not known why this change happened, and it could explain why the filming process began in 1925 but was completed in 1927. 

In 1922 the first short film was produced in Tunisia, named "Zohra," and shortly after the first long film was produced. In 1928 the first movie was produced in Syria with a native director and leading actor, and in 1929 Jordano Pidutti an Italian director, directed a film about a Lebanese immigrant in the United States. Badr and Ibrahim Lama were the first Palestinian filmmakers. They were born in Chile but moved to Egypt to produce their first film in 1927. They are significant figures of Arab cinema. 

The 1930s begin with Egypt leading another successful production of a full length silent movie, "Zeinab", and with the first Iranian movie being produced, "Abi and Rabi". 1932 was a groundbreaking year. The first two movies with sound were produced. For technical reasons, they had to be recorded in Paris, France. 1932 was also the year that the first movie with clear Zionist ideas emerged, "Oded The Wanderer". There were big waves of immigration of Zionist Jews in the area of Palestine in the 1920s and 1930s because of the Balfour Declaration. 

In 1933 Herta Gargour, a Lebanese woman, financed the opening of a Lebanese production company called "The Lumnar Film Company". This production company produced the first film that was fully financed by Lebanese producers, "In the Ruins of Baalbek". It was also the first movie in which the Lebanese dialect of Arabic was spoken. 

The official start of Palestinian cinema is in 1935, when Ibrahim Hassan Sarhan filmed and produced Saudi Crown Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz‘s visit to Palestine. 

In 1934-35 the Studio Misr was established in Egypt. The film studio was founded by the , which is still a functioning bank, and under Talaat Harb a very well-known economist and co-founder of Banque Misr. Banque Misr was founded in 1920 and it had the goal of nationalizing Egypt's economy. The initiative to open their own film studio was part of Egypt's nationalization process. Harb managed to send young men abroad to learn the newest European techniques in film production and then with funding from Banque Misr acquired sophisticated equipment. The Studio Misr was a very successful project. It produced many successful movies, such as "Wedad, Munyet Shababi, al-‘Azeema, Salama fi Kheir", and many more. The success of many of these movies was due to the movie touching on important social issues of the time such as poverty. Many big stars also grew through this company, such as Umm Kulthum who was already a successful singer, but started a successful acting career. 

Unfortunately, not all the countries saw the growth of national industries, especially those occupied by France, where native culture was repressed and only French culture was promoted. From the 1920s, especially in the 1930s many French movies were produced in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. These countries were used as backgrounds due to their "exotic" look and the perceptions that Europeans had about the "Orient." The use of these countries for their "exotic" features caused the reproduction of many negative stereotypes against the natives.

In 1941 Iran's Shah, Reza Shah, had to step down from his position to due foreign pressures. Syria started an independence movement from France. In 1943, the French granted independence to Lebanon. These independence movements increased film production in the region. 

In 1943, the first post-independence movie was produced in Lebanon called "The Rose Seller". The same year in Turkey the first fully dubbed movie was produced, "Troubled Spring". In 1944 the "Centre Cinématographique Marocain" was founded with the goal of producing Moroccan films. In 1946, France established "Studios Africa" in the Maghreb (Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco) to produce documentaries with material from the colonies. Both of these studios had the purpose of creating and sharing propaganda regarding the revolts that were taking place in French colonies. By 1946, the studios were producing films in Arabic, not only French, and they became much more approachable to the audience by producing content that discussed Islam. Nevertheless, the movies' purpose was to spread propaganda especially against resistance fighters that were requesting independence from the French.

In 1948, Turkey, Iran, and Iraq saw growth in their film industries. In Iran, Esmail Kushan founded the "Mitra" film company which could produce sound movies. This was important because until then sound movies had to be filmed in Europe. In Iraq, "Alia and Issam" the first Iraqi movie was produced. In Turkey, the government decreased the tax on cinema tickets which increased the demand for films and the production of films. The State of Israel was established and in 1949, the "Israeli Motion Picture Studios" opened.

Egypt managed to gain independence from the British in 1952 with the "Free Officers" overthrowing the monarch and establishing the Ministry of National Culture and Language. Just two years later, in 1954, war broke out in Algeria. Algeria demanded independence from the French colonial forces. In 1956, Egypt gets attacked by Israel during the Suez Crisis. Morocco and Tunisia are granted independence by France in 1959 as well, but not Algeria, and Spain also gives up its territories in Morocco. By 1958 the first Lebanese Civil War begins. 

Despite all the setbacks, film industries still managed to grow. Youssef Chahine is an important Egyptian director who always included some political commentary in his movies. He lived through very turbulent times in Egypt and he is well-known for not accepting censorship. He discussed topics such as the British occupation, Nasser's rule, Islamism, and the changing relationships between the Arab world and the Western world. One of his most important films is "Jamila the Algerian", produced in 1958. This is his first film in which the message was clearly political. Another important work of his is the documentary "Cairo, As Told By Chahine," released in 1991, which showed the two sides of Cairo: an opulent center of the Arab world and a city ridden by poverty and religious intolerance. In 1953 the first Turkish color film was produced by , called "Carpet-weaving Girl." In Lebanon the were founded. In 1957 the first Jordanian film was produced, "Struggle in Jarash". It was the first movie which was fully produced in Jordan by locals, and it was produced in Arabic. In the same year "Where to?" by was the first fully Lebanese movie that was presented at the Cannes Festival.

The 1960s were a decade of change in the region. This change is connected to liberation, especially in North Africa, and it, can be seen through the expansion of national film industries. Algeria gained its independence in 1962 after 8 years of war. At the time that liberation was granted, Algeria had 424 cinemas, many more than other countries of the Maghreb. Non-print sources of information were very important in Algeria when forming a national identity because of the very high illiteracy rates. The use of cinema, or radio, played such a significant role in the independence war that the French declared those mediums colonial propaganda. By 1964, Algeria had managed to nationalize its film industry with a very important figure of Algerian cinema . Algeria is home to a native group, Amazigh which speaks Berber. This group was always the most suppressed under French colonization, but it continued being suppressed even under an Algerian government. This can be seen in productions of , an Algerian government-owned production company, where Berber languages were strictly forbidden.

Palestinian cinema also grew in the 60s as a form of resistance. Mustapha Abu Ali, Hany Jawhariya, and Sulafa Jadallah established a film unit in Jordan which was owned by Fatah, which at the time was the liberation force in Palestine. It produced documentaries about the Israeli occupation of Palestine. Other organizations such as the PFLP, the , and the PLO also started producing documentaries to spread their cause, but they couldn't be as successful as the Algerian organizations because they had no access to the occupied territories. Their films focused more on the life conditions in refugee camps and in military actions and attacks that were taking place out of the occupied territories. An example of such a documentary is the "Aftermath" which is a short documentary the depicts the humanitarian conditions at the refugee camps after the 1967 war with the goal of gaining humanitarian aid for the Palestinians. What was different about this documentary is that it included interviews from natives speaking Arabic which made the message stronger. However, this movie as well as many others of that time fail to address the problem behind the refugees and present the refugees as "a problem that needs to be solved." 

Morocco gained its independence from France in 1956. The Moroccan state took no control over the cinemas. The first feature films were produced in 1968 by the national film organisation Centre Cinématographique Marocain, which was founded by colonial authorities in 1944. It is still the heart of Moroccan national cinema today. During the 60s Tunisia still struggled for independence so the movies produced in Tunisia were either French productions or films that demonstrated the struggle for independence.

"The Night of Counting the Years" or "The Mummy" was produced in Egypt in 1969 by Shadi Abdel Salam and it is based on a true story. The Egyptian star Nadia Lufti who was featured in this film was an important figure in Egyptian cinema. It is considered to be one of the best Egyptian movies to have ever been produced as it marks the start for the age of realism in Egyptian cinema. Moreover, it was shot in which is very uncommon for Egyptian films. 

The 1970s were a decade of instability in many of these countries. In 1970-71 the situation between Israel and Palestine evolved rapidly with thousands of Palestinians losing their life due to the Black September events. While this was a tragic escalation of the conflict, it allowed Palestinian Resistance Cinema to grow. Palestinian Resistance Cinema is different compared to other resistance cinemas because it did not change public opinion on the conflict, but it did work as a mobilization force for many Europeans as well as a unitary force between Arabs and Palestinians. These were documentary-style films that had the ultimate goal of educating and informing people. One example of such a film is "With Soul, With Blood" which was produced by the Palestinian Film Unit in 1971. It discusses the conflict between the army of the Jordanian king, King Hussein, and the PLO, and the attacks that followed (Black September). It was directed by Mustafa Abu Ali and it was a cornerstone for Palestinian and MENA Resistance Cinema as it made commentary on Western Imperialism in the Middle East in general. In 1976 in Lebanon, which so far was experiencing its "golden-age" in cinema, the second Lebanese Civil War broke out which put an abrupt end to the success of Lebanese cinema for some time.

In Morocco, the film industry did not experience much growth. That is partly due to the fact that Moroccan film production was not nationalized so there was very little incentive to produce films, and partly because cinema did not seem to be that popular in Morocco. That led to many Moroccan films being very popular internationally but not in Morocco. Tunisian cinema did not grow much either, as the film industry was dominated by European and French productions. At a time more approximately 60% of all available films were European.

Other countries were experiencing growth in their national film industries. In 1972, Egypt saw one of its greatest productions "Watch Out for Zuzu" featuring one of the greatest Egyptian actresses, Souad Hosni. In the same year, Syria organized the first International Film Festival for Young Arab Cinema in Damascus, and the production in Turkey reached an average of about 300 productions annually. Algeria also experienced growth in the 70s. In 1975 Mohammed Lakhdar-Hamina produced "Chronicle of the Years of Ashes", a movie about resistance and the fight for independence in Algeria. Lakhdar won the Palme D'or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1975 for the production of that film. This was the most expensive Algerian production so far, and it popularized Algerian cinema internationally. In 1978, "The Nubah of the Women of Mount Chenoua" was the first Algerian film directed by a woman, Assia Djebar 

The 1980s inherited much turmoil from the previous decades. Lebanon was still going through Civil War (started 1976 - lasted 15 years), a new war breaks out between Iran and Iraq in 1980, Turkey went through a three year long dictatorship from 1980 to 1983, and in 1982 Israel invaded the south of Lebanon. These developments were a major setback for the film industries of the countries. 

The Israeli attack on Beirut affected the Palestinian film industry significantly. The PLO's headquarters were located in Beirut and many important documents, pictures, videos, etc. were stored there. The destruction of the headquarters caused a decrease in the production of Palestinian films. The loss, however, was not detrimental with a new famous movie being produced in 1987 by director Michel Khleifi. The movie "Wedding in Galilee" was the first fictional Palestinian movie and it was inspired by the challenges Palestinians faced living in territories controlled by the Israeli military. 
The war between Iran and Iraq inspired a new movie genre "sacred defence." About 50 films were produced in that genre during the war. Despite the production of such films, the Iranian regime was overall against cinema. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution and in the first three years of Khomeini's rule more than 150 cinemas were destroyed throughout the country. This was because cinema and film production was seen as a way for the west to "inject" its values into Iran and Islamic states in general. Later on, cinema proved to be a necessary medium for the regime as it could easily spread information. The movies that could be produced from then and on had to be approved by "The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance" (established in 1982) and had to fit in some specific "boxes." By 1983, the Iranian regime seemed more keen on producing and exporting films and the "Farabi Cinema Foundation" was established. During the 1980s few films were produced in Iran but they were successful. In 1986 two major movies were produced that put Iran on top of film productions internationally, "The Runner" by Amir Naderi and "Bashu, The Little Stranger" by Bahram Beyzai. Three years later, the movie "Where Is My Friend's House?" was the first by Abbas Kiarostami, famous Iranian director. 

By the 1980s most film industries were well-established. Lebanon plaid a significant role in the distribution of Egyptian films internationally due its colonial connections with France. Algeria and Syria provided funds to young native film-makers but Morocco provided no resources to native film-makers and focused all its funds to foreign documentaries. Even the countries that made efforts to nationalize their film industries were missing one main factor, money. Many countries in the region were fighting for survival and depended on foreign funding. 

During the 1980s Palestinian productions saw a decrease because of the ongoing conflict. Despite the harsh conditions that film producers and directors had to work under they still managed to produce few influential movies. One of them was a documentary-style film "Children, Nonetheless" (also known as Children, Nevertheless) which came out on the UN-declared year as Year of the Child and pointed out the discrepancy between the declaration and the living conditions of Palestinian children. 

The 1990s were marked by a new wave of Islamic Fundamentalism in the region, and increased violent conflicts. These two main factors had some effect on the growth of national film industries. Egypt, previously known as one of the countries with the most vibrant and successful film industries, started a "witch-hunt" against artists, including actors/actresses, directors, and script writers. The peak of this era of "witch-hunts" in Egypt was in 1994 when Youssef Chahine, arguably the most important and successful Egyptian director, got sent to court for one of the movies he produced. That movie is called "The Exiled" and Chahine was sent to court for it because it depicted the Prophet Joseph, which according to the religious rulings in Egypt and Islam was not allowed. Despite the court ruling that the movie should be removed from movie theaters, it remained one of the most popular and successful movies of Chahine. Despite the regime's response, in 1997 Chahine went on to create another very successful movie which challenged Islamic Fundamentalism, "Destiny." Not all countries had the same response to the rise in Islamic Fundamentalism. Tunisia in 1994 saw the production of the film "Beb El-Oued City," a film which demonstrated the consequences that Islamic and religious fundamentalism could have in the society. That movie made it to the Cannes Film Festival and won the International Critics' Prize by the F.I.P.R.E.S.C.I., as well as a lot of global recognition. 

In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, and in 1991 the U.S.A. invaded Iraq starting the Gulf War. Just a year later, in 1992, Algeria gets in a 10-year-long Civil War. These conflicts put a rough end, or long pause, to the film industries of these countries. Algerian cinema, once very successful, crumbled with the cinema sector being privatized in 1993 and the government organization responsible for funding closing down by 1998. 

Palestinian films kept getting produced at a steady pace, and got a boost when Rashid Masharawi established the "Cinema Production and Distribution Center" in Ramallah in 1996. In 1995 Khleifi produced what is considered to be one of the greatest Palestinian productions, "Tale of the Three Jewels." It was a successful movie internationally and it made a difference by not showing any violent scenes or scenes from war in general, but rather demonstrating the effects of the war on people, and children more specifically. 

In 1990 the first privately-owned television channel opened in Turkey, with the name of "Magic Box Inter Star 1". This was a first for the region and it put an end to the era of the Turkish film industry as many professionals started working for the TV. However, in 1996 "The Bandit" (Eşkiya) is the first film to be released in the new cinema of Turkey, which managed to somewhat revive domestic film production. 

Iranian cinema flourished in the 1990s. In 1991 Rakshan Bani-Etemad became the first woman to receive the "Best Director" award at the in Iran. She won this award for her movie "Nargess." Later, in 1997, Abbas Kiarostami won the "Palme d'or" at the Cannes Film Festival for the film "Taste of Cherry". Also, a wider range of films were allowed to be released, because the rules for Iranian cinema become less strict. 

In the 2000s, regional cinema grew a lot as some directors started discussing certain taboo topics such as homosexuality and transsexuality. A film released in the year 2000, "Room to rent" (Khaled al-Haggar)"," is about an Egyptian man called Ali who is studying in London. He becomes friends with Mark, a gay photographer. This creates a fresh perspective on sexuality and socially prescribed sexual roles. The 2002 film "Une minute de Soleil en moins," directed by Nabil Ayouch depicts a police inspector who starts a friendship with a transvestite. These are quite well-known examples, but other films that critique sexual repression of queer people more obviously did not reach such a wide audience. Examples are the Lebanese "How much I love you" by Akram Zaatari and Palestinian Tawfik Abu Wad's "Diary of a Male Whore". 

Most national film industries grew in the 2000s, while others had a setback because of conflicts. Egypt still dominated the Arab film scene. However, it has also progressed a lot in the 21st century compared to the three decades beforehand. In the 70s, 80s and 90s cinema in the country was slowed down largely due to government film institutions being made private. Since then, more movies have been produced and have also improved in quality. In the year 2000, three Iranian movies won awards at International Film Festivals, "The Apple" by Samira Makhmalbaf, "Djomeh" by Hassan Yektepanah, and "A Time for Drunken Horses" by Bahman Qobadi. These movies became well-known and established Iranian cinema on the global stage.
In 2004 the Palestinian Film Foundation was created in the United Kingdom to organize Palestinian cinema in the UK. The Palestinian film "Paradise Now" directed by Hany Abu-Assad was released in 2005. This was the first Palestinian film allowed to enter in the United States Academy Awards. The non-governmental organization Shashat was founded in Ramallah. Its primary objective is to encourage women's filmmaking. Many young Palestinian women joined the documentary filmmaking scene in the 2000s. Three important Palestinian documentary filmmakers are Rima Essa, Suha Arraf and May Oday. All of them work and live in Palestine. The dominant themes in modern Palestinian films are "Palestinian displacement, exile, diaspora and statelessness".

In Turkey, domestic cinema brings in more money than international films in 2008. In fact, the top ten films in terms of profit are all national films. It is the first time for this to happen since the years. In post-Yeşilçam Turkey, new themes have appeared in films. Examples are "novel interpretations of Turkification and of Turkey's relationship to digital technologies, globalization and transnationalism".

A new country that has entered the international film industry in the Middle East is the United Arab Emirates. Its first domestically produced film "Dream" was released in 2005 and directed by Hani Al-Shibani. It takes place in the desert, where a group of actors is moving around. Film festivals are taking place in the U.A.E., such as the Middle East International Film Festival, the Dubai International Film Festival, the Emirates Film Competition, and the Gulf Film Festival. The financial base and infrastructure to support filmmaking now exist in the Emirates, as well as film training schools.

Foreign relations of Turkey

Turkey, officially the Republic of Türkiye, is a transcontinental country known as the "gateway from Europe to the Middle East". Because of this important position, play a large role in how this region functions.

The Republic of Turkey was founded on 1 November 1923, with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk as the first President of Turkey. He implemented many reforms in the country, including the secularization of Turkey, lessening the importance of Islam. Because of these major reforms in the country, their foreign relations were less important, and the country was relatively isolated on an international level.

Mustafa Kemal Atatürk died in 1938, and his death marked the start for a new period in Turkish foreign relations. The main focus of this new period was World War II. The new president, İsmet İnönü, was in a difficult position, having to choose between the Allies and the Axis powers. In the end, despite signing a treaty with the United Kingdom and France , but Turkey decided to stay neutral, selling chrome to both sides. However, just before the end of the war, Turkey declared war on Germany and Japan in February 1945. This showed some good will to the Allies, and it allowed Turkey to join the United Nations as one of the fifty-one founding members.

As mentioned above, Turkey was one of the fifty-one founding members of the United Nations. Turkey also joined the NATO (North Atlantic Trade Organization) in 1952. The country received Marshall Plan aid, a financial support plan designed by the United States to stop the Soviet Union from spreading communism. This shows Turkey's good relations with the West during the Cold War. 

After the Cold War had ended and the Soviet Union had been dissolved, Turkey went into a process to enter the European Union, which still has not happened yet. Despite this, Turkey can be seen as an intermediary between Russia and the EU, two opposing blocks. 
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan came to power as Prime Minister of Turkey in 2003 and became President of Turkey in 2014. Under Erdoğan, Turkey has implemented a policy of . This policy means that Turkey should honour its Ottoman heritage by maintaining strong relations with all regions formerly under Ottoman rule. This has led to Turkey trying to get more power in neighbouring regions, like the Balkans, the Middle East, and the Caucasus. Additionally, Turkey has shifted away from a Western-oriented foreign policy under Erdoğan, instead having a less democratic and more pro-Russian, pro-Chinese approach. This is a cause for concern for some in the West.

Turkey has been a NATO member since 1952, seeking protection from the threat formed by the Soviet Union. Turkey has been involved in different NATO operations and training programs, and houses various military bases and airbases for NATO. They have participated on NATO's side in the Korean War before they had joined NATO, sent troops to Afghanistan, and received NATO support to defend themselves from the threat of potential airstrikes formed by the Syrian Civil War. In the first half of 2022, Turkey stood central in NATO. Due to the threat of Russia, EU members Sweden and Finland wanted to enter NATO. All member states accepted except for Turkey, stating as reason that these states gave asylum to Turkish refugees, deemed to be migrants by the Turkish state. These people were often part of organisations like the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the (PYD), or the (YPG), and the Turkish state says that these are terrorist organisations.

The European Union (EU) and Turkey established relations in 1959, and made their relations formal in 1963 with the . The EU and Turkey are also members of the . 
Turkey's foreign relations policies have historically been focussed on relationships with the Western world, moving to the historical goal of . As Turkey's AKP-led government has put more focus on Turkey's regional presence in the Balkans, the Middle East and the Caucasus, the relationship with the Western world has been deteriorating and negotiations of accession to the EU have come to a halt.

Turkey was one of the first few members to join the Council of Europe in 1950. Since the 1963 Ankara Agreement, relations between Turkey and the European Union were improving and in 1987, Turkey applied for membership to the European Economic Community, which later became the European Union. The negotiations for accession are still ongoing, but have come to a standstill in recent years after president Erdogan's crackdown on supporters of the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt, the presidential powers created by the and Turkey's path to a more autocratic form of government. Although Turkey is not a member of the EU, have been implemented based on the Ankara Agreement. 

Since the 2016 Turkish purges, relations with the EU have deteriorated significantly. Some of the most notable issues affecting these relations are the , the , the Turkish , and the Turkish . 

Arguably the most pressing issue is the . Since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011, Turkey has taken nearly 4 million . Many of these refugees moved on to Europe, sparking the 2015 European migrant crisis. In 2016, the EU and Turkey made a 'refugee deal', which resulted in the EU giving financial support to Turkey to strengthen its borders and host refugees.

Kingdom of Hanover

The Kingdom of Hanover () was a kingdom in northwest Germany. It was created in October 1814 by the Congress of Vienna. It came after the Electorate of Hanover (officially the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg). It joined 38 other countries in the German Confederation in June 1815. The kingdom was ruled by the House of Hanover. This was a branch of the House of Welf. It was in personal union with Great Britain since 1714. Usually a viceroy controlled Hanover. This was because its monarch lived in London. The viceroys were usually younger members of the British royal family.

The personal union with the United Kingdom ended in 1837 when Queen Victoria became the queen of the UK. This was because females were not allowed to rule Hanover while a related male was still alive. Because of this, her uncle Ernest Augustus thus became the ruler of Hanover. His only son took over from him as George V. However, he was on the losing side of the Austro-Prussian War. His kingdom was then taken over by Prussia in 1866 and lost independence. It became a Prussian province. Hanover became part of the German Empire with the unification of Germany in January 1871. The country came back as the State of Hanover in 1946. But this state was later merged with some smaller states to form the current state of Lower Saxony in then West Germany. The city of Hanover became the capital of this new state.

Aurore Gagnon

Marie-Aurore-Lucienne Gagnon, simply known as Aurore Gagnon (31 May 1909 –12 February 1920), was a Canadian girl who was a victim of child abuse. She died of exhaustion and blood poisoning (sepsis), She had about 52 wounds inflicted by her stepmother, Marie-Anne Houde, and her father, Télesphore Gagnon. The story of "l'enfant martyre" (English translation: "The Child Martyr") received great attention in the media. Aurore became an icon of Quebec society and popular culture.

Aurore was born into and raised in a Roman Catholic family. She was the second of five children of farmer Télesphore Gagnon and his first wife Marie-Anne Caron. Her parents married in September 1906. They lived in Fortierville, Quebec. It was a small village on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River. The villiage was a southwest of Quebec. The Gagnons' first child, Marie-Jeanne, was born in August 1907. Aurore's birth was soon followed by that of Lucina then Georges in 1910 and Joseph in 1915. 

In 1916, not long after Joseph's birth, Marie-Anne Caron was hospitalized for tuberculosis. Marie-Anne Houde, the widow of a cousin of Télesphore, soon moved into the Gagnon home. She claimed that she wanted to "take care of the house and children." She was a 30-something-year-old-mother of two sons, Gerard and Henri-Georges. She was born in Sainte-Sophie-de-Lévrard, a nearby municipality of Fortierville, Quebec. On 6 November 1917, 2-year-old Joseph was found dead in his bed. A coroner's inquest showed that it had been a natural death. Some villagers thought that Marie-Anne Houde had something to do with the death. 

On 23 January 1918, Marie-Anne Caron died of tuberculosis at the Beauport Asylum. The next week, Télesphore married Marie-Anne Houde. The villagers were suspicious when two of her children soon died, but there was no investigation. During this time, Télesphore was beating Aurore with an axe handle. At age 10 in September 1919, Aurore was hospitalized for more than a month at the Hôtel-Dieu de Québec. She had a very bad infection in her leg caused by a beating. When she was released from the hospital, the beatings started again.

Aurore died on February 12, 1920. The cause was listed as poisoning. It was not known if she had been poisoned or if it was caused by an infection from her many wounds. Télesphore Gagnon and Marie-Anne Houde were arrested as they tried to leave the church after her funeral on February 16, 1920. Marie-Anne Houde was sentenced to be hanged for murder. The sentence was changed to life imprisonment.

After serving 15 years, she was paroled for "health reasons." She died of breast cancer in May 1936. Télesphore Gagnon was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was released from prison in 1925 for "good behavior" after serving only five years. He returned to his hometown and previous life, where he wrote several letters to Marie-Anne Houde, still in prison. After Houde's death, Télesphore remarried. He died peacefully in 1961.

Aurore Gagnon is still a popular cultural icon in Quebec. She has almost mythical status. Many books have been published about her life. In 1920, the first dramatic production was written by Louis Petitjean. It would eventually become his most famous play. Télesphore Gagnon tried unsuccessfully to block the release of the 1952 movie.

Spyker F1

The Spyker F1 Team was a Formula One team owned by Spyker, a Dutch car brand. It existed only in 2007. The team was bought from Midland in 2006 and was sold to become Force India later on in 2007. 

In 2006, during the 2006 Formula One season, it was announced that Spyker had bought the struggling Midland F1 team. Every race that was left would be raced under the Spyker name and the livery would be changed to orange, because that's the national colour of the Netherlands. 
In the 2007 season, the team was fully in the hands of Spyker. However, to the public, the team did not perform better than Midland. It was known as a backmarker, a team that almost always finds itself at the back of the grid. 

On the tenth of July it was announced that the only Dutch driver with Spyker, Christijan Albers, would be fired because his sponsors failed to pay the Spyker F1 team. He would be replaced by Winkelhock and, later on, Yamamoto. 

During the 2007 European Grand Prix, held at the Nürburgring, Markus WInkelhock found himself leading the field in his only race for Spyker and in F1. This was because he was the only driver to make a pitstop before the race started. It was a rainy day and the team decided on wet tyres, as they work better in the rain than other compounds. This move put him in last, but many people in front of him either spun off or decided to get wet tyres for themselves. Suddenly, after passing the man in front, he was leading the race. At the height of his triumphant drive, he was 33 seconds in front of the driver in second. However, this wouldn't last long. Because of a series of crashes caused by the rain, the race was red-flagged. After the race restart, he was quickly overtaken by the faster cars behind him. He later on retired because of a hydraulics issue.

At the end of 2007, Spyker F1 was sold to an Indian holding company called Orange India Holdings. This was officially the end for Spyker in Formula One. The team turned into Force India for the start of 2008.

2023 Emilia-Romagna floods

The 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods were a series of floods in and around the cities of Bologna, Cesena, Forlì, Ravenna, and Rimini, in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. The first floods happened between 2 and 3 May 2023, killing two people. Heavy secondary floods happened on 16–17 May 2023, killing at least 14 people and displacing 20,000 others. The usual amount of rain that falls in seven months fell in two weeks which made twenty-three rivers to overflow causing the floods.

On 17 May, Stefano Bonaccini, the president of Emilia-Romagna said that "in the last 24 hours, more than 300 millimeters of rain have fallen" and described the floods as a "catastrophic event, never seen before".Later on, Bonaccini compared it the impact to the 2012 Emilia earthquakes, saying that the damage was likely to be less significant but would still cost the region billions of euros to repair. Lucia Mercalli, president of the Italian Meteorological Society, said that "two records were broken in 15 days in the same region. An event that occurred on 2 May might happen once in a century, but then other one hit the same areas only 15 days later."

Emergency operations were carried out in response to the flood, including members of the Italian Red Cross, various armed and police forces, Protezione Civile and the Carabinieri. The state-owned energy company Enel made a task-force that would cooperate with local companies and forces to restore electricity to the affected areas.

Desert kite

Desert kites () are dry stone wall structures found in Southwest Asia (Middle East, but also North Africa, Central Asia and Arabia). They were first discovered form the air, in the 1920s. 

These structures were built in the stone age, from about 10.000 years ago, to about 2.500 years ago. They consist of two walls, at an angle. Very likely, they were used for hunting. Today, over 6.000 structures are known. The sizes range from less than to several kilometres in length. Very often, they are shaped like a kite. Usually, they are made of stone walls, less than high.

Little is known about their ages, but the few dated examples appear to span the entire Holocene. Most peole think that they were used as traps for hunting game animals such as gazelles, which were driven into the kites and hunted there.

Desert kites are stone structures with a convergent shape. They are made of linear piles of stones. The structures have lengths between less than a hundred metres to several kilometres and heights of less than one metre, even accounting for erosion. Often, there are gaps in the lines. These gaps may have been left by the builders on purpose. They may also have been the result of lines formed by alignments of cairns rather than a continuous row. There are different shapes that are referred to as "desert kites". The lines usually form two walls ("antennae") that converge into an enclosure ("head") with attached cells. The common kite type varies by region. Sometimes the existence of these cells is considered essential for a desert kite.

Research published in 2022 has identified that pits several metres deep often lie at the edge of enclosures: these have been interpreted as traps and killing pits. The kites enclose surface areas with a median of . Much larger and much smaller sizes are also known. Dating kites is difficult; various dating methods like radiocarbon dating and optically stimulated luminescence have given ages ranging from the early to the late Holocene. Sometimes, there are reports of their use in travel records. Some kites have been replaced by later archaeological structures, eroded or flooded. Sometimes they were used to build more complex shapes. In some places, structures like cairns, tombs or square walls occur alongside kites.

They are typically found in massifs or topographically complex terrain. They almost never occur in sloping terrain, mountainous regions, or within endorheic basins, although they occur at the margins of mountains. Often, the terrain within the kite is much more open than the outside terrain, lacking vegetation and rocks. In general, the visibility of the kites from their inside is poor, which appears to be a purposeful feature of their construction; for example, the ends and entrances of the kites often coincide with slope breaks (places where the slope changes). Within a given region, the kites tend to have a preferred orientation. They are absent from humid climates and from certain hyperarid areas, and their use may have been influenced by Holocene climate changes.

Their often enormous size and conspicuousness in arid or semiarid terrain renders them visible in aerial images, while their construction in rough terrain makes them almost invisible on the ground. Sometimes, natural features like cliffs are used in conjunction with the artificial walls to form a kite. Clearing vegetation around the lines or using rocks with a different colour from the background has been documented in volcanic terrain. In Arabia, cairns and linear stone alignments have been found associated with kites.

Kites are known from the Middle East and Central Asia, with examples known mainly from Armenia, Egypt, Iraq, Israel-Palestine, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, Uzbekistan and Yemen. They have also been found in South Africa. , there were over 6,000 known kites in Asia and the Middle East, and in some parts of Syria there are as many as 1 kite every , to the point that they are partially overlapping or form complicated structures. Similar large enclosures that were presumably used as traps have been found in Europe, where they were dated to Mesolithic and Neolithic age; North America, where structures known as drive lines have been used into the 19th century AD; South America; and Japan.

Strontianite

Strontianite (SrCO) is an important raw material. It is used for the extraction of strontium. It is a rare carbonate mineral and also one of a few strontium minerals. It is a member of the aragonite group.

The mineral was named in 1791. It was named after the place Strontian, Argyllshire, Scotland. The discovery of the element strontium was also made the previous year (1790) before the mineral was named in Strontian. Strontium is more common than copper and is found at a level of 370 parts per million by weight, 87 parts per million by moles in the Earth's crust. The ores of strontium are celestine SrSO and strontianite SrCO. Strontium is not found freely in nature and the process of producing strontium metal commercially involves reducing strontium oxide with aluminium. Good mineral samples of strontianite are rare.

Eagle, Jackdaw and Shepherd

Eagle, Jackdaw, and Shepherd is a story from Aesop's Fables. It teaches a lesson.

An eagle saw a lamb and grabbed it to eat. A jackdaw saw the eagle. The jackdaw wanted to do the same thing! He flew down and landed on a ram. He tried to grab the ram but got stuck.

A shepherd saw the jackdaw. He caught the jackdaw and cut its wings. He took the jackdaw home to his kids.

The kids asked, "What kind of bird is this?"

The shepherd said, "It's a jackdaw. But it wants to be an eagle."

The Bulls and the Lion

The Bulls and the Lion is one of Aesop's Fables. It teaches that friends should stick together against enemies.

The lion killed the bulls one by one. None of the bulls could fight the lion alone.

The story teaches that enemies will try to break up friendships. Friends should not listen to people trying to make them argue. They should work together against enemies. Some versions tell leaders to keep their people united. Then enemies cannot defeat them.

The fable has been translated into many languages. Artists have made many pictures to go with the story. Poets have written longer versions to teach the message. One poem in the 1700s used 13 bulls, like the 13 American colonies. It said they should unite against Britain, their enemy.

The fable shows why friends and allies should cooperate against enemies, instead of arguing amongst themselves.

Friends and allies should stick together against enemies. Do not let outsiders cause fights between you.

Luttra Woman

The Luttra Woman is a bog body that was found near Luttra, Sweden, on 20 May 1943. The body has been dated to the Early Neolithic period, of about 3800-3600 BC. In Swedish, the body is called Hallonflickan(), in Danish, she is called Hindbærpigen. Both names are translated as "Raspberry Girl." This name comes from the fact that when she was found, her stomach showed that raspberries had likely been her last meal. At the time of her death, she was a teenager, or a young adult. There are no traces of injuries or fatal diseases on her body. She was likely tied up before her death, and drowned on purpose. Axel Bagge, an archeolgoist who assisted in the first investigation, said that she had either been a human sacrifice, or she had been executed.

Since 1994, her body has been on permanent display at a museum in Falköping.

, she was the earliest-known Neolithic person from Western Sweden.

When experts looked at the body, they concluded that she must have been a pretty girl or young woman. She was was a little smaller than other women her age. She was tall. Other women of her age, in the region usualy were beteen and tall. In the area where her stomach must have been, a large number of raspberry seeds were found. In the stone age, there were no technologies that would allow to keep raspberries for a longer time period. For this reason, her death must have been in summer, likely in July or August. This makes her a special case, as the other bog bodies found in Sweden all died during the winter months. In the 1990s, scientists tried to determine her age. They found that she must have been at least eighteen years old, more likely 20-25 years. Radiocarbon dating found that the woman had died about 1000 years later than first thought, between 3105 and 2935 BC. When looking at the surrounding soil, remains of freshwater snails were found. Likely, the woman was drowned in open water. Later, the area became a bog. 

Three years before the body of the woman was found, people had found an arrowhead, made of flintstone, about away. People thought, the arrow had missed the woman, and that she had been hit by another arrow. Later her body moved into the water. Further excavations were done, but they neither found another arrowhead, nor any wounds that would explain that an arrow had hit her. Therefore, the arrowhead is likely unrelated to the woman.

, her body has been on a permanent exhibition titled "Forntid på Falbygden" () at the Falbygdens Museum, Falköping, since 1994. There is also a bust of what she might have looked like, displayed at the museum. Stockholm-based model-maker Oscar Nilsson created it.

Bog body

A "bog body"' is a human cadaver, that has been left in a bog. Because of the circumstances, it has been mummified, using natural mummification. The enviroment of the peat bog means that certain features are preserved, which would usually decay. Such bodies are often found, the oldest ones date to about 8000 BC, the most recent ones are those of dead soldiers of the Second World War.

Dog food

Dog food is food Dog food is food made for dogs. Dogs are omnivores but they like to eat meat. They have sharp, pointed teeth and shorter gastrointestinal tracts of carnivores, better suited for meat than vegetables. Their feeding habits evolved as they lived with humans in agricultural societies and ate scrap leftovers and excrement from humans. Dogs' ability to digest carbohydrates easily may be a key difference between dogs and wolves. 

The first food was made specifically for dogs in the nineteenth century, Spratt's Patent Dog Biscuit. In the United States people spent around $23.3 billion in 2022 on dog food.

In evangelical Christianity, the Sinners prayer is a short prayer. It admits sin and asks Jesus to save. 

Belantsea

Belantsea is an extinct genus of cartilaginous fish that lived during the Lower Carboniferous, about 350 million years ago. It belongs to the order Petalodontiformes, which are called petalodonts, in the family Belantseidae. Its fossils are almost complete individuals.

"Belantsea" is the best known member of the order Petalodontiformes.

"Belantsea" would essentially‭ ‬have‭ ‬been the Carboniferous equivalent of a parrotfish. Its body was leaf-shaped, with muscular fins and a small tail. Its few, large, triangular teeth formed a beak-like arrangement that allowed it to graze bryozoans, sponges, crinoids, and other encrusting animals.

The species in this genus are:




"Belantsea" is a carnivore. 

It's up to‭ ‬70‭ ‬centimeters long.

You can find "Belantsea" fossils in the USA, including Kansas‭ ‬-‭ ‬Zeandale Limestone Formation,‭ ‬Montana‭ ‬-‭ ‬Heath Formation,‭ ‬and Nebraska.

Baskirian to Gzhelian of the Carboniferous.

Because of its rather ungraceful body and veil-like fins, experts believe that "Belantsea" was probably a slow swimmer.




Old World silverside

The Old World silversides are a family, the Atherinidae, of marine and freshwater fish belonging to the order Atheriniformes. Atherinidae are abundant and considered bony fish (teleosts) that are widespread globally, living in rivers, estuaries, and coastal waters. 

They occur worldwide in tropical and temperate waters. About two-thirds of the species are marine, and the others live in fresh water. There are 74 species in 13 genera. 

The genus "Craterocephalus" is the most diverse with 25 species. Four genera are monotypic.


Silversides are relatively small with most being less than 20 cm (7.9 in) in length, with several not attaining lengths of more than 5 cm (2.0 in). The body is generally elongated. Distinctive characters include two dorsal fins widely separated, with the first consisting of flexible spines and the second having one spine followed by soft rays, while the anal fin has one spine on the leading edge followed by soft rays. The pectoral fins tend to be high, and there is no lateral line. On the flanks is a broad, silvery band. The scales are relatively large. Some species, such as the hardyhead silverside, "Atherinomorus lacunosus", are commercially fished.

The family Atherinopsidae (Neotropical silversides) is closely related, while the genus "Atherion" has been given family status in the Atherionidae by some authorities.

The separation between the ancestors of Craterocephalinae and Atherininae caused Atherininae lineage to form in Southern Australia, which has cooler habitats than Northern Australia.

The subfamily Atherininae has five genera. One is "Atherina", which is found near the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean oceans; however, the remaining four are restricted to Australia’s southern coastal waters. 

Since "Atherina"’s biogeographic location is significantly different, it is likely that "Atherina" and the four genera are not monophyletic or do not descend from a common ancestor. Instead, "Atherina" is hypothesized to have a sister lineage with the ancestors of Atherininae and the Craterocephalinae.

Janassa

Janassa is an extinct genus of cartilaginous fish. It lived in marine environments in what is now central United States of America and Europe during the Carboniferous and upper Permian. It is known from teeth and a few poorly preserved body fossils from Germany.

It was possibly related to the modern-day ratfish.

According to the fossils, "Janassa" had a body plan very similar to that of the modern skate. However, "Janassa" was a petalodont, a kind of ancient cartilaginous fish related to chimaeras. Its teeth suggest it crushed and ate shellfish, such as brachiopods.


The type species is "Janassa bituminosa".

Chomatodus

Chomatodus (from Greek: χωμα "choma", 'mound' and Greek: ὀδούς "odoús" 'tooth') is an extinct genus of cartilaginous fish belonging to the family Petalodontidae. 


There is no type species.

We don't know what it looks like. Some people draw it as a slender shark. Others mistake it for a perciform fish. So far, people have found teeth and tooth fossils instead of complete fossils.



Antliodus

Antliodus is an extinct genus of cartilaginous fish, a petalodont from the Carboniferous. It is known from the Mississippian of the United States, Britain, and Belgium. Though many species have been reported in the past, a lack of recent revisions means some may be dubious.



Helicoprion

Helicoprion is an extinct genus of cartilaginous fish. Almost all fossil specimens are of spirally arranged clusters of the individuals' teeth, called tooth whorls, which in life were embedded in the lower jaw. As with most extinct cartilaginous fish, the skeleton is mostly unknown. It is one of the most popular sharks of all time. It was always assumed that the "Helicoprion" was a shark, but it is more closely related to ratfish.

It had skeletons made of cartilage. As a result, the entire body disintegrated once it began to decay, unless preserved by exceptional circumstances. This can make it difficult to draw precise conclusions on the full body appearance of "Helicoprion".

The tooth was unusual-looking. Many shark fans call the tooth a tooth whorl. The largest known "Helicoprion" tooth whorl, specimen IMNH 49382 representing an unknown species, reached 56 cm (22 in) in diameter and 14 cm (5.5 in) in crown height, which would have belonged to an individual over 7.6 m (25 ft) in length.

"Main article: Tooth whorl"

A tooth whorl is a structure found on the "Helicoprion". Almost all "Helicoprion" specimens are known solely from tooth whorls, which is a name shark lovers call when they see a tooth whorl.


Several large whorls are difficult to assign to any particular species group, "H. svalis" among them. IMNH 14095, a specimen from Idaho, appears to be similar to "H. bessonowi", but it has unique flange-like edges on the apices of its teeth. IMNH 49382, also from Idaho, has the largest known whorl diameter at 56 cm (22 in) for the outermost volution (the only one preserved), but it is incompletely preserved and still partially buried. "H. mexicanus", named by F.K.G. Müllerreid in 1945, was supposedly distinguished by its tooth ornamentation. 

Its holotype is currently missing, though its morphology was similar to that of IMNH 49382. In 1922, Karpinsky named a new species of "Helicoprion", "H. ivanovi", from Gzhelian (latest Carboniferous) strata near Moscow. However, this species has subsequently been removed from "Helicoprion" and placed as a second species of the related eugeneodont "Campyloprion".

Hypotheses for the placement and identity of "Helicoprion"'s tooth whorls were controversial from the moment it was discovered. Woodward (1886), who referred the first known "Helicoprion" fossils to "Edestus", discussed the various hypotheses concerning the nature of "Edestus" fossils.

Karpinsky's hypothesis of the placement of the tooth whorl was putting it on the nose. Many people said that "the tooth whorl on the nose looks so weird." It now has its tooth whorl in its lower jaw.

"Helicoprion" was a famous animal because it has been found in many websites. People have given it the name buzzsaw shark.

UNESCO Global Geoparks

UNESCO Global Geoparks (UGGp) are places and landscapes with interesting, unusual geology. They are certified by the UNESCO Global Geoparks Council. They have to meet a set of criteria. The GGN is a network of geoparks. It is also an agency of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) which administers the network.

Condenser (heat transfer)

A condenser is a heat exchanger used to condense a gaseous substance into a liquid state through cooling. In so doing, the latent heat is released by the substance and absorbed into the environment around it. Condensers are used for efficient heat rejection in many industrial systems. Condensers can be made in multiple designs and they come in many sizes ranging from small (hand-held) to very large (industrial-scale units used in plant processes). For example, a refrigerator uses a condenser to get rid of heat extracted from the interior of the unit to the outside air. This cools the food inside of it.

Condensers are used in air conditioning, industrial chemical processes such as distillation, steam power plants, and other heat-exchange systems. Use of cooling water or surrounding air as the coolant is common in many condensers.

A "condenser coil" used in air conditioning systems normally has a heat exchanger section to cool down and condense the refrigerant vapor into liquid, a compressor to raise the pressure of the refrigerant and move it along, and a fan for blowing outside air through the heat exchanger section to cool the refrigerant inside. A normal setup of a condenser unit is as follows: The heat exchanger coil section wraps around the sides of the unit with the compressor inside. In this heat exchanger section, the refrigerant goes through multiple tube passes, which are surrounded by fins through which cooling air can circulate from outside to inside the unit. There is a motorized fan inside the condenser unit near the top, which is covered by a cover to keep any objects from accidentally falling on the fan. The fan is used to pull outside cooling air in through the heat exchanger section at the sides and blow it out the top through the grate. These condenser units are located on the outside of the building they are trying to cool, with tubing between the unit and building, one for vapor refrigerant entering and another for liquid refrigerant leaving the unit to the Evaporator.

Novostav (Rivne Oblast)

Novostav (until the 1940s — "Jurydiko-Novostav") — a village in the Zoryanska village community of the Rivne district of the Rivne region of Ukraine. The population is 779 people.

The village is located one kilometer north of Klevan on the southern (partially northern) side of the railway near the already dried Stubla floodplain on both sides.

Novostav has named objects: Dacha (Dachi) "Sanatorna district", where in 1924 the burgher Svishchuk built the first rest house in the purchased forest; Busli "an inhabited riverbank, where storks and storks once gathered before departure" and many others.

The name Novostav comes from the two-component Novy Stav, which, in turn, was the result of distinguishing two Stavs: the older and the newer. The original Stav, which on the left bank of the Stubla took the name of the tract where it was, and apparently, somewhere in the vicinity of the former water mill, is now gone, as well as the stream of Zhivets (Zhylivets), which originated from spring waters.

According to legend, Novostav got its name from the expression "to build a new village", because it is said that the surrounding villagers decided to create a new settlement here after the Tatar pogrom. But some tend to see in the name the concept of "a settlement created at the new pond on the right bank of the Stubla".

For the first time, Novostav, but under the name Novy Stav, is mentioned in a charter of 1516, where it is said that King Sigismund I granted Bohus an estate named "Zhukovo" with the villages of "Belev" and "New Stav". At that time, according to popular speech, there was still "Stary Stav", located on the left side of Stubla on the road to Olyshva in the vicinity of the sanatorium, Klevanska Secondary School. It was, obviously, the oldest settlement of Novostava, and now it is its precinct.

In 1577, "Novyi Stav" as an estate of Ivan Czartoryiskyi paid Klevansky castle large in-kind duties from the apiary, pitch mill, grain grinding, fishing. Two years later, the "Novostav bridge" was mentioned, which was completely destroyed by the spring flood when the Stubelka overflowed.

According to the "lustration" of 1579, "Novostav" held three "gardens" of the Lutsk castle. The act of 1588 confirms the ownership of "New Stav" to Yuri Czartoryiskyi as a castle settlement with preferential duties.

At the end of 1603, an enterprise for the production of "turpentine", tar, resin was built in "Novy Stave" using foreign equipment.

During the war of liberation, in 1652, "Novostavetskoe estate" was completely devastated. Great damage was done to him by new punitive noble units. Then a large part of the peasants went to the Pinsk swamps.

According to data from 1779, Novostav is a "village" eparchically belonging to Klevan, which then had 89 yards and 789 inhabitants. A little later, "Yuridiko-Novostav" was formed - the northwestern outskirts of Klevan in the vicinity of the church.

According to the 1947 directory, Jurydiko-Novostav, which had a village council, was renamed Novostav.

North Borneo

North Borneo (other names include British North Borneo and State of North Borneo) was an area in the northern part of the island of Borneo. Between 1881 and 1946, it was a British protectorate. The North Borneo Chartered Company governed it. In 1946, it was renamed to "British North Borneo", and became a crown colony. In 1963, it became independent, and joined what would later become the country of Malaysia. Today, the area makes up the Malaysian state of Sabah. North Borneo mainly produced timber for export, most of the workforce worked in agriculture.

Evaporator

An evaporator is a device used to turn a liquid into a gas through evaporation.

Air conditioners and refrigerators use a compressed liquid with a low boiling point that vaporizes inside the system and cools it, while releasing the thermal energy into its surroundings. The cooling liquid, or refrigerant is pumped into the cooled compartment (the evaporator coil) inside an air handler. Low pressure then causes the refrigerant to evaporate taking the heat with it.

Let's Go Brandon

"Let's Go Brandon" is a political slogan and Internet meme used as a substitute for "Fuck Joe Biden". The phrase is used by critics and to make fun of Joe Biden, the 46th and current president of the United States.

The phrase began when people chanting "Fuck Joe Biden" began during sporting events in early September 2021. On October 2, 2021, during a televised interview with the Sparks 300 race winner Brandon Brown and NBC Sports reporter Kelli Stavast incorrectly described the chant in the background as "Let's Go Brandon".

The slogan has become well known through use by Republican politicians and critics of Biden.

While President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden were taking phone calls for NORAD's Santa tracker hotline on December 24, 2021, a caller ended his chat by saying, "Merry Christmas and let's go Brandon," to which President Biden smiled and responded, "Let's go Brandon, I agree."

In mid-2022, a another meaning of the phrase, "Dark Brandon", became a meme by supporters of Biden. "Dark Brandon" initially was a meme created by online progressives to mock supporters of "Dark MAGA". 

Biden's 2024 re-election campaign has also used the meme, using a picture of "Dark Brandon" on their website's error message page. President Biden even mentioned "Dark Brandon" during the 2023 White House Correspondents Dinner.

Ingushetia

Ingushetia (; ; ), also spelled Ingushetiya, officially the Republic of Ingushetia, is a republic of Russia. It is in the North Caucasus region of Eurasia. The republic is in the North Caucasian Federal District. It borders the country of Georgia to the south, and the Russian federal subjects of North Ossetia–Alania to the west, Chechnya to the east, and Stavropol Krai to the north.

Its capital is the town of Magas. Its largest city is Nazran. At 3,600 square km, the republic has the smallest area of Russia's non-city federal subjects. It was made on June 4, 1992. This was after the Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was split in two. The republic is home to the indigenous Ingush people. The 2021 Census said its population was estimated to be 509,541.

Ingushetia is one of the poorest and most unstable regions of Russia. This is mostly because of the insurgency in the North Caucasus. The violence has slowed down in recent years. However, the insurgency in Chechnya has sometimes came over the border into Ingushetia. According to Human Rights Watch in 2008, the republic has lots of corruption, crime, anti-government protests, attacks on soldiers and officers, and low human rights.

The name "Ingushetia" comes from the Russian name of the region's people (Ingush) and the Georgian suffix -éti. "Ingushetia" literally means "the place where the Ingush live". Other names like "Dzurdzuketi", "Kistetia", "Gligveti", "Gelia", "Galga", and "Ingushiya" have also been used for the region.



Wireless clicker

A wireless clicker or wireless presenter is a remote control used to control a computer during a presentation, instead of a "mouse or the keyboard". Usually it has a laser pointer inside to pintpoint parts of the screen. It is mainly used to show a computer presentation created with PowerPoint using a video projector and allows the presenter to move freely in front of the audience. 

An RF pointer-mouse consists of a transmitter similar to a remote control ­used in a Television set and a small receiver, usually connected to a USB port on the computer.. 

Among other additional elements there can be a built-in flash memory in the USB receiver, so that there is no need to plug in an additional flash drive to carry the presentation file. Some models include a vibration alarm, to notify the speaker when time is up

Apart from the elements to control the presentation, the clicker transmitter often contains a laser pointer. A distinguishing feature among the models offered is the color of the laser. For presentations green laser is more visible than red laser.

Heat pump and refrigeration cycle

Heat pump cycles, refrigeration cycles or thermodynamic cycles are the fundamentals for heat pump, air conditioning and refrigeration systems and how they work. A heat pump is a mechanical system that allows for the transfer of heat from one location to another. They work under thermodynamic laws. 

According to the second law of thermodynamics, heat cannot move from a colder location to a hotter area by itself. Work is required to achieve this. An air conditioner requires action to cool a living space by moving heat from the interior being cooled to the outdoors. A refrigerator moves heat from inside the cold interior area to the warm room temperature air of the kitchen. This idea of an ideal heat engine was explained using the Carnot cycle by Sadi Carnot in 1824. A refrigerator or heat pump is an example of a heat engine that is running in a reverse Carnot cycle.

Heat pump cycles and refrigeration cycles can be "vapor compression", "vapor absorption", "gas cycle", or "Stirling cycle" types.

The vapor compression cycle is used by many refrigeration, air conditioning, and other cooling applications. It is also used within heat pumps for heating applications. The vapor compression cycle has two heat exchangers. One of them is the condenser, which is hot and releases heat. The other is the evaporator, which is cold and takes heat. For applications that need to operate in both heating and cooling modes, such as heat pumps, a reversing valve is used to switch the roles of the heat exchangers.

At the start of the cycle, the refrigerant enters the compressor as a low pressure and low temperature vapor. The pressure is then increased and the refrigerant leaves as a higher temperature and higher pressure gas. This hot pressurized gas then moves through the condenser coil, where it releases heat to the area as it cools and condenses completely. The cooler high-pressure liquid next passes through the expansion valve which lowers the pressure suddenly and causes the temperature to drop a lot. The cold low pressure mixture of liquid and vapor next travels through the evaporator coil where it vaporizes completely when accepts heat from the area around it before returning back to the compressor as a low pressure low-temperature gas to start the cycle again.

Simple systems with a normal temperature range, such as a refrigerator, may use a fixed speed compressor and fixed orifice expansion valve. Systems that need to operate in different conditions, such as air conditioning, where outside temperatures and heat demand change a lot through the seasons, will sometimes use a variable speed inverter compressor which can run slow or fast and an adjustable expansion valve to control the speed of the cycle better.

During the 20th century, the vapor absorption cycle using water and ammonia systems was popular and widely used but after work on the vapor compression cycle, it lost much of its use because of its low efficiency (about one-fifth of the vapor compression cycle). It is now only used where heat is more available than electricity, such as industrial waste heat, solar thermal energy by solar collectors, or propane refrigerators in motorhomes.

The absorption cycle is similar to the compression cycle, but depends on the partial pressure of the refrigerant vapor. In the absorption system, the compressor is replaced by an absorber and a generator. The absorber dissolves the refrigerant in a suitable liquid and a dilute solution becomes a strong solution. In the generator, the temperature increases, which also increases the partial pressure of the refrigerant vapor released from the strong solution. The generator needs a heat source. This consumes a lot of energy unless waste heat is used.

Absorption refrigeration systems can be powered by combustion of fossil fuels (e.g., coal, oil, natural gas, etc.) or renewable energy (such as waste heat recovery, biomass combustion, or solar energy).

State of Hanover

The State of Hanover () was a state in the British Zone of Allied-occupied Germany. It was a state for 92 days as the Free State of Prussia was dissolved after World War II. The state came after the former Kingdom of Hanover. Its capital was Hanover. In 1946, Lower Saxony was made by merging Hanover with Brunswick, Oldenburg and Schaumburg-Lippe.

The State of Hanover made up the territory of the old Prussian Province of Hanover without a few eastern parts that had become part of the Soviet occupation zone after World War II (Amt Neuhaus and the eastern part of Bleckede, Elbingerode and Ilfeld). It included 85% of today's Lower Saxony. Its capital and largest city was Hanover.

After the Second World War, the State of Hanover was made under Ordinance No. 46 of the British military government. Its first minister-president was the Social Democratic politician Hinrich Wilhelm Kopf.

On 23 November 1946 the British Military Government made the new state of Lower Saxony. It was made from the unification of the German states of Brunswick, Oldenburg and Schaumburg-Lippe with Hanover.

The eastern areas of Brunswick which had fallen to the Soviet zone, including the old County of Blankenburg and the exclave of Calvörde (part of the Helmstedt district) were not part of Lower Saxony and later made part of the East German state of Saxony-Anhalt. The former Hanoverian Soviet-occupied lands of Amt Neuhaus and the eastern parts of Bleckede were again made part of Lower Saxony after German reunification in 1990.



Unification

Peace of Prague (1866)

The Peace of Prague () was a peace treaty signed by the Kingdom of Prussia and the Austrian Empire at Prague on 23 August 1866. It ended the Austro-Prussian War along with a few related treaties between Prussia and the Austrian allies in central and southern Germany.

The treaty was lenient towards the Austrian Empire. This was because Otto von Bismarck had persuaded Wilhelm I that keeping Austria as powerful would be better in the future for Prussia than harsh terms. Bismarck realized that without Austria, Prussia would be weakened against the rest of Europe. At first, Wilhelm I had wanted to go on to Vienna and annex Austria but Bismarck stopped him and even said he would resign or even throw himself out of the fourth-story window of Nikolsburg Castle. In the treaty, Austria lost Veneto to Italy. The Habsburgs were removed from German affairs ("Kleindeutschland"). The German Confederation was abolished.

Xbox Game Pass

Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass are video game subscription services provided by Microsoft. It originally launched on June 1 2017 but people subscribed to Xbox Live Gold received priority and gained access to the service on May 24. Xbox Game Pass provides the subscription service for the Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X as well as iOS, iPadOS and Android using Xbox Cloud Gaming while PC Game Pass is available on PCs using Windows 10, Windows 11 or MacOS with support for Xbox Cloud Gaming.

The idea of what became Game Pass came from two areas. First was with Phil Spencer becoming the head of the xbox brand, replacing Don Mattrick following the troubled launch of the Xbox One. Mattrick positioned the Xbox One as an entertainment hub rather than a games console and certain design choices had to be changed following negative criticism of the positioning by consumers and the media. After Spencer took over the Xbox brand, he recognized the Xbox needed a better position as they planned for the next generation of the console, while giving the team more encourage with his new ideas, even if they were risky.

Confederation of the Equator

The Confederation of the Equator () was a short-lived state established in the northeastern region of Brazil during that nation's struggle for independence from Portugal. The secessionist movement was led by wealthy landowners who opposed early reforms by the nation's first leader, Emperor Pedro I. Pernambuco and Ceará were the first of five Northeastern provinces to secede. 

The Confederation ceased to exist after being crushed by Brazilian forces under Thomas Cochrane. 
The rebellion in the Northeast followed a similar uprising in Pernambuco only five years earlier. 
Before independence, North Brazil had been one of the two separate viceroyalties, Grão-Pará, besides the Viceroyalty of Brazil in the South. Pedro I combined the two into one Imperial State. However, the North was historically more averse to secession from Portugal and had fought to remain part of the Portuguese empire, before being defeated by Pedro I and being annexed. The Confederation was a second popular attempt. 
Both the secession of Brazil from Portugal and the suppression of the Loyalist Viceroyalty of the North were aided by Britain, militarily and with personnel, such as Thomas Cochrane, on loan to Pedro I, a Freemason and Anglophile.

Pedro I sent troops to the Northeast to quell the rebellion, with all three provinces falling by September of that year. The state of Ceará managed to survive until November, and the last stronghold of the Confederation in the Sertão was the site of the final resisting leaders of the fallen nation.
Several rebels were condemned by a military tribunal to death. One notable execution was that of Frei Caneca an intellectual and religious mentor supporting the cause of the Confederation, in which some soldiers refused to fire. After briefly escaping, he was eventually executed in 1825.

While they existed throughout the 2010s in many parts of the country, they gained prominence in the 2020s. Before the 2022 federal election, only three teal independents held seats in Parliament, but after the election there were seven. The teal independents that were elected to the House of Representatives represent electorates in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Hobart and regional Victoria. Furthermore, one teal independent (former rugby league player David Pocock) was elected to the Senate for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). Teal independents have also contested state elections in New South Wales and Victoria, but are less successful.

Teréz Zsolnay

Teréz Zsolnay, married Mattyasovzky (21 March 1854 – 16 May 1944) was a Hungarian applied artist in the medium of ceramics who worked for the Zsolnay Ceramic Factory, founded by her father Vilmos Zsolnay in Pécs, in 1868.

Along with her younger sister Julia and Ármin Klein, she was the most important artist of that factory during its rapid growth and worldwide success in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Teréz based her artistic expression on Hungarian folk motifs, and for this purpose she collected more than 10,000 folk art objects. In her memoirs, she also mentions that in addition to collecting folk treasures from around Pécs, she also had the opportunity to study the most typical motifs of other parts of Hungary, thanks to the friendliness of the then director of the Hungarian National Museum, who made many objects available to her.

In addition, she closely followed trends in contemporary applied art, and in her memoirs she mentions the writings of Jacob von Falke, the director of the Museum of Applied Art in Vienna, who relied on the ideas of Gottfried Semper.

Moreover, together with her sister Julija, she visited the then-famous painter and applied artist Hans Makart in his Viennese studio.

Among the sources she used was Jost Amman's book with 122 woodcuts of women's clothing, published in 1586.

Her husband, Jakab Mattyasovzky, was a geologist who traveled across Hungary, and was of great help to his wife`s father Vilmos in finding the best clay deposits needed to make fine ceramics.

She largely devoted her life to her family, and at the age of 70, she began writing the "History of the Zsolnay Factory", which she wrote in the form of memoires for over 20 years, on almost 2,500 pages of text.

She was already over 70 years old when she got involved in the work of the factory again, painting Egyptian, figural and geometric motifs on vases (the so-called Tutankhamun series).

She was buried, together with other family members, in the family mausoleum in Pécs.

Economic patriotism

Economic patriotism is the idea that the government should make choices about the economy that give more help to certain groups, businesses, or industries depending on what they do and where they are. 

Economic patriotism means wanting to help your own area more than yourself. It is also when you feel that you need to help the people who live in your area. Economic patriotism can apply to different areas. It can also involve different types of economic . This includes transfers in a country or between countries. Economic patriotism means using different ways to help our own industries and trade with other countries. It is different from economic nationalism because it helps the local economy without stopping trade or immigration. It is important for leaders to growth and make sure competition is fair. Economic patriotism also talks about watching over big companies to protect a country's economy. However, it can be hard to do that when companies work in many countries. The energy sector shows the need for people to work together across a region to keep their money and jobs.

Many American politicians, like Ro Khanna, Elizabeth Warren, and Barack Obama have suggested plans that use economic patriotism to help American industries and keep jobs safe. Economic patriotism is also being used around the world. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has supported economic patriotism by giving rewards to businesses that stay in Ukraine and help it get stronger, especially after Russia's invasion in 2022. Another example is the Polish company Drutex which sells its products to different countries and also spends money in their own country on research and to hire people to help their economy grow.

Eusebio Tejera

Eusebio Ramón Tejera Kirkerup ("León del Maracaná") (6 January 1922 – 9 November 2002) was a Uruguayan footballer. From 1945 to 1950 he played for Club Nacional de Football, winning the Uruguayan championship in 1946, 47 and 50. He also earned 31 caps for the Uruguay national football team from 1945 to 1954. He was part of Uruguay's team championship at the 1950 FIFA World Cup, and also participated in the 1954 FIFA World Cup. He was big and tough defender, tireless fighter, physically strong and indomitable perseverance. From the beginning he had a special features: grit, toughness, sharpness and courage, virtues that were quickly brought him to fame. Versatile player of high quality. Popular "El Cato" launched a style of play "fly backs," also emphasized the long and accurate passing. Widely regarded as one of Uruguay's greatest defenders of his era.

The 1.80-metre-tall defender, known as El Cato, who was mainly used as a left-back or centre-back, began his football career at Bella Vista. From 1943 and 1945 he played for River Plate Montevideo. From 1945 to 1950 he found the sporting highlight of his career with the Montevideo club Nacional, with whom he became Uruguayan national champion in 1946, 1947 and 1950. He played 155 games for the Bolsos, in which he also scored one goal. He then played for Cúcuta Deportivo and finished his career with Uruguayan club Defensor.

Tejera debuted for the Uruguayan national team on January 24, 1945, when he faced Ecuador in that year's Copa América at the National Stadium in Santiago. He was still a player for Uruguayan River Plate. The team was only in fourth place. As a Nacional player, he was in two more editions of the Copa América, in 1946 and 1947, with Celeste finishing fourth and third respectively. In 1949 the entire national team was disbanded, being represented by a youth team in the face of the long strike that had broken out the previous year. 

Tejera was a starter at the 1950 FIFA World Cup even eight pounds above ideal, with photographs from the time recording a protruding muscles. The summons did not cease to be widely criticized by the press of his country. Tejera was paired with Matías González from the first match, 8-0 on Bolivia. But the lack of form hampered him in the following matches. Against Spain, Uruguay started out winning, but the score was reversed to 2-1 after Tejera could not keep up with the speed of opposing winger Estanislao Basora. The South Americans got the draw thanks to an individual move by Obdulio Varela. 

Against Sweden, the unfolding was similar: the Uruguayans started winning and suffered a partial upset of 2-1. Tejera was the only lineman to remain on the back foot while the rest of his teammates advanced to avoid defeat, a tactic rewarded with another turnaround, now favorable, with Celeste winning 3-2 thanks to two goals in the final fifteen minutes. On the day of the Maracanaço, Tejera and the other Uruguayans looked relaxed when they were profiled in the pre-match ceremonies against Brazil. When the two teams posed for photographs, the bulk of the reporters positioned themselves to record the Brazilians. Tejera then went on to exclaim: Come here, the champion is here 

In the match, Tejera was in charge of marking Zizinho, being assisted in the task by the right midfielder Juan Alberto Schiaffino, who retreated with the other midfielder, Julio Pérez, to reinforce the marking in order to avoid the exchanges of passes between Zizinho, Ademir and Jair, plays that had made Brazil thrash their previous opponents. Tejera also occasionally assisted Matías González in marking on Ademir. The tactic took effect in the first half, which ended at 0-0 and with the most dangerous shots being created by the visitors. In the second half, he was not to blame for Friaça's Brazilian goal. 

After the World Cup, Tejera went to play in the Colombian team of Cúcuta, which earned him a few years of absence in the national team, which only in the 1970s began to admit the convocation of those who played abroad. He returned to Uruguay to play for Defensor, in time to be called up to the 1954 FIFA World Cup. However, he did not play any matches, with the celestial defense being composed of José Santamaría, William Martínez and Víctor Rodríguez Andrade. Tejera's last match for Uruguay took place on 5 June of that year, the date of the last match before the World Cup, in which the defunct Saarland team was thrashed 7-1 in Saarbrücken.

Gas heater

A gas heater is a heater used to heat a room or outside area by burning natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, propane, or butane.

A gas heater controls its cycle by using a mechanical or electronic thermostat. Gas flow is turned on with a valve. The gas is lit by an electric filament or pilot light. Flames heat a radiator in the air duct, convection or a fan may distribute the heat to the room. 

Non-flued heaters – also known as unvented heaters, vent-free heaters, or flueless fires, are either permanently installed or can be moved around, and sometimes will have a catalytic converter. Non-flued heaters can be not safe if safety rules are not followed. There must be enough ventilation and they must be kept clean. They should always be switched off before sleeping. If they are operating correctly then the main emissions of a non-flued gas heater are water vapor, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide.

Flued heaters are permanently installed wherever they are placed. The flue, if properly installed correctly should remove all of the heater emissions. A correctly operating flued gas heater is safe for use.

Not all flued heaters are allowed for use in indoor living spaces. Some flued gas heaters can be used indoors, but not where people eat or sleep. For example, the normal power-vented garage unit heater in North America. These heaters are best in garages, commercial areas, or industrial spaces. They are not good where people live.

Oil heater

An oil heater, also known as an oil-filled heater, oil-filled radiator, or column heater, is a form of heater used in home heating. Although they are filled with oil, it is electrically heated and does not involve burning any oil. 

Oil heaters consist of metal columns that are hollow inside, where heat transfer oil flows freely around the heater. A heating element at the base of the heater heats the oil, which flow the heater by convection and then to the area around the heater by air convection and thermal radiation. The columns of oil heaters are constructed as thin fins so that the surface area of the metal columns is large compared to the amount of oil and element which provides the warmth. A large surface area allows more air to be in contact with the heater at any point in time, allowing for the heat to be transferred more effectively. This results in a surface temperature that is safe enough to touch. The heating level is controlled by a thermostat.

Oil heaters cost more to run and provide far less heating than gas heaters, they are still used in bedrooms and other small-to-medium-sized enclosed areas. This is because gas heaters, especially without a flue, are not suitable for bedroom use. Gas heaters cannot be used in confined spaces due to the reduced oxygen, and the emissions produced. This leaves electrically powered heaters, such as oil heaters, fan heaters, and heat pumps, as the only alternatives.

List of games included with Windows

Video games have been a part of Microsoft Windows operating systems, starting with Windows 1.0x. Microsoft, the company behind Windows, has included games in various versions of Windows, like the Microsoft Entertainment Pack and Microsoft Plus! Some of these games have also been included in later versions of Windows. One popular game, Microsoft Solitaire, has been included in every version of Windows except for Windows 8 and 8.1. The newest version of Windows, Windows 11, comes with Microsoft Solitaire Collection and Surf.

When Microsoft was developing Windows 1.0 in the early 1980s, they planned to include games. Initially, they developed two games called Puzzle and Chess, but later decided to include Reversi instead, based on the popular board game. Reversi was included in Windows versions up to Windows 3.1. In 1988, an intern named Wes Cherry developed Solitaire, with the card deck design by Susan Kare, who was known for her work on the original Macintosh.

The purpose of including Solitaire was to help users feel more comfortable with the operating system, especially since graphical user interfaces were still new to many people. It helped familiarize users with using a mouse, such as the drag-and-drop technique for moving cards.

Export beer

Export beer is a kind of beer with around 5% alcohol by volume. It has a longer shelf-life, so transporting (and exporting) it was easier. It is usually stronger in taste than Lager beer. As special yeast is used, export beer only became available year round when there were chillers. The kinds of yeast used need a temperature of between 4 and 9 degrees Celsius for fermentation. Traditionally, there are three kinds of export beers: Dortmunder, Münchner, and Wiener. In the 1970s, people started to prefer Pilsner over export beer.

"Dortmunder" was first brewed in 1843, in Dortmund. Because of industrialization, cooling was readily available which allowed Dortmund to become one of the important sites of brewing in Europe. At first, Dortmunder was associated with what the workers drank. Today, Dortmunder is a protected designation of origin. It needs to be brewed in Dortmund, with the local water. Dortmunder Exportbier has a golden color.

"Münchner Export" is brewed in Munich, and exists in different colors. Unlike with Dortmunder and Wiener, where the hops is the component giving the most taste, with Münchner it is the malt. Traditionally, Münchner Export uses darker malt, and is darker in color.

"Wiener Export" is not brewed very much anymore. It is between Dortmunder and Münchner, in color.

Deadpan

Deadpan comedy, also known as dry humor or deadpan humor, is a comedic style characterized by a deliberate and emotionless delivery of jokes or absurd situations. It relies on a contrast between the deadpan delivery and the humor or absurdity of the content, creating a unique comedic effect that often catches the audience off guard. This essay will explore the origins, characteristics, and impact of deadpan comedy.

The origins of deadpan comedy can be traced back to vaudeville and silent film era, where comedians like Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin mastered the art of deadpan delivery. However, it gained prominence in the mid-20th century with comedians such as Jack Benny and Bob Newhart. Deadpan comedy became a defining characteristic of their acts, and it quickly gained popularity among audiences.

One of the key characteristics of deadpan comedy is the delivery. Comedians who employ this style maintain a stoic and expressionless demeanor while delivering jokes or performing absurd actions. They maintain a straight face, often using deadpan pauses and minimal gestures to enhance the comedic effect. This contrast between the serious delivery and the humorous content creates a sense of irony and surprise, eliciting laughter from the audience.

Deadpan comedy relies heavily on timing and subtlety. Comedians use precise pauses and deadpan reactions to build anticipation and deliver punchlines with maximum impact. It requires a high level of comedic skill to master the art of deadpan, as the success of the joke depends on the perfect balance between the delivery and the content. Too much emotion or exaggeration can ruin the deadpan effect, while too little can make the humor go unnoticed.

One of the strengths of deadpan comedy is its versatility. It can be used in a wide range of comedic situations, from one-liners and observational humor to satirical and absurd scenarios. Deadpan comedy often plays with the expectations of the audience, subverting traditional comedic tropes and challenging societal norms. It can be used to highlight the absurdity of everyday situations or to make social and political commentary in a subtle and thought-provoking manner.

Deadpan comedy has had a significant impact on the comedy landscape. It has influenced numerous comedians and comedic actors who have adopted the deadpan style in their performances. Comedians like Steven Wright, Mitch Hedberg, and Demetri Martin have achieved great success with their deadpan delivery, using it as a unique selling point in their acts. Television shows like "The Office" and "Parks and Recreation" have also popularized deadpan humor, with characters delivering lines with a straight face and deadpan delivery, often leading to hilariously awkward situations.

Furthermore, deadpan comedy has transcended cultural boundaries and gained international recognition. Comedians from different countries have embraced this style and adapted it to their own comedic traditions. The deadpan delivery has become a universal language of humor, allowing comedians to connect with audiences around the world through its understated yet effective approach.

In conclusion, deadpan comedy is a unique and influential comedic style that relies on a deliberate and emotionless delivery of jokes or absurd situations. It has its roots in vaudeville and silent film era but gained prominence in the mid-20th century. The deadpan delivery, precise timing, and subtle humor make it a versatile and impactful form of comedy. It has shaped the comedic landscape and continues to entertain and surprise audiences with its unexpected and ironic punchlines. Deadpan comedy is a testament to the power of understatement and the art of delivering laughter through a straight face.

Attic fan

An attic fan, is a fan that controls the heat level of a building's attic by removing the hot air. A thermostat is used to turn the fan off and on based on the heat level, while sometimes a manual switch is used. An attic fan can be gable mounted or roof mounted. Extra vents are required to draw in fresh air as the hot air is exhausted. Attic fans are typically used in warmer months when temperatures in an attic can get above . A fan may be installed in an attic for the purpose of cooling a whole house by venting hot air out via the attic. These fans are often called whole-house fans.

Mechanical attic ventilation fans may be powered in a variety of different ways. Most attic vents fitted to homes are powered off electricity supplied by the power meter. A trend towards solar-powered attic ventilators is observable in the interest of conserving electricity and lowering monthly utility bills. Wind-powered roof turbines, often referred to as "whirly-birds", are also used to ventilate attics and other confined spaces. 

Attic fans may be wired in different ways. Normally, the fan is wired directly into an electric circuit and is controlled by a thermostat commonly ranging from to . It may also be hardwired but turned on and off using a switch. Another method is to have the fan plugged into an electric outlet mounted nearby. An environmentally friendly method is to wire a fan to a roof-mounted solar panel.

Chiller

A chiller is a machine that removes heat from a liquid through an vapor compression, adsorption refrigeration, or absorption refrigeration cycles. This liquid can then be moved through a heat exchanger to cool equipment. Refrigeration makes waste heat as a byproduct that must be removed from it or for greater efficiency it can be recovered for heating purposes. Vapor compression chillers may use any of a number of different types of compressors.The most used today are the hermetic scroll, semi-hermetic screw, or centrifugal compressors. The condensing side of the chiller can be either air or water-cooled. The chiller is often cooled by an induced or forced draft cooling tower. Absorption and adsorption chillers need a heat source to work.

Chilled water is used to cool and dehumidify air. This is used in large commercial, industrial, and institutional buildings. For example, schools, hospitals, and factories. Water-cooled chillers can be liquid-cooled (through cooling towers), air-cooled, or evaporatively cooled. Water or liquid-cooled systems can be more efficient and have environmental impact advantages over air-cooled systems.

In air conditioning systems, chilled coolant, normally chilled water mixed with ethylene glycol, from a chiller in an air conditioning or cooling plant is distributed to heat exchangers, or coils, in air handlers or other types of devices which cool the air in that area. The water is then brought back to the chiller to be cooled again. These cooling coils transfer sensible heat and latent heat from the air to the chilled water. This cools and usually dehumidifies the air. A chiller for air conditioning applications is rated between and , and at least two manufacturers (York international and LG) can produce chillers capable of up to cooling. Chilled water temperatures (leaving from the chiller) usually range from , depending upon application requirements. Chillers will get water at 12°C (entering temperature), and cool it to 7°C (leaving temperature).

When the chillers for air conditioning systems are in need of repair or replacement emergency chillers may be used to supply chilled water. Rental chillers are mounted on a trailer so that they can be quickly brought to the site. Large chilled water hoses are used to connect rental chillers and air conditioning systems.

Ranghar

Ranghar are a community of Muslims who were classified as an "agricultural tribe" by the British Raj administration. especially in 1st Horse Skinner's Horse.

The term Ranghar has also been used for closely related Muslim communities, the Pachhada and the Muslim Tagas of Haryana and the Muley Jats. In addition, the Odh community in Pakistan are also often known as Ranghar.

Ranghars were known as Muslim Rajputs. The Ranghar can be roughly divided into sub-groups, conveniently divided by the Yamuna river. Those to the west of the river remained as pastoralists much longer than the Yamuna Ranghar, who were all settled agriculturist by the start of the 19th century. The partition of India further divided these two groups, with the trans Yamuna Ranghar emigrating to Pakistan, while those of the Doab region remaining in India. They comprise a large numbered of dispersed intermarrying clans. These exogamous groups are made up of myriad landholding patrilineages of varying genealogical depth, ritual, and social status called biradaries or brotherhoods scattered in the various districts of western Uttar Pradesh. The biradari, or lineage is one of the principal point of reference for the Ranghars, and all biradaris claim descent from a common ancestor. Often biradaris inhabit a cluster of villages called chaurasis (84 villages), chatisis (36 villages) and chabisis (26 villages). An example of a chatisa is that of the Chauhan Ranghar of the Agauta pargana of Bulandshahr District.

The Yadavs who migrated from Mathura (Braj) to Bihar and its surrounding areas came to be known as Mathraut or Majrauth.
In Bihar and Jharkhand there were many rulers and zamindars belonging to Ahir (Yadav) caste. During British Raj, the Ahir zamindars were predominantly found in northern and eastern parts of Bihar. Most of them belonged to Krishnaut and Majhraut clans of Ahir

Majhrauts are found all over Bihar but numerically they exceed other sub-caste in Saharsa and it's adjoining district of Bihar.

Species description

When a new species is discovered, it needs to be described. This is known as species description. Today, this description is done in the form of an article or paper, published in a scientific journal. The scientific description has to follow strict rules. The person who is the author of the scientific article is also the person who is seen as the one who discovered the species. Usually, he or she can propose a name for the species. If the article has many authors, all of them are seen as discoverers of the species. Describing a species belongs to taxonomy.

Species descriptions have also been done in historic times. That way, Aristotle's History of Animals is probably among the first such publications. The book was published around 343 BC. In it, Aristole describes some of the creatures of his homeland, mostly fish and invertebrates. He also included a few mythical creatures, such as the manticore.

In the year 77 AD, Pliny the Elder described several species, in his work Natural History. He probably read Aristonle's work, as he also describes many of the mythical creatures Aristole does.

In the 13th century, the didactic text "Konungs skuggsjá" was written. It had many descriptions of whales, seals, and monsters of the Icelandic seas. The descriptions were short, and often contained errors. The descriptions include those of a mermaid, and of a large sea monster called Hafgufa. At first, the author did not want it, because he thought it was too big, but felt it was important enough to be included in his descriptions. Today, we know that the Hafgufa does not exist.
Carl Linnaeus wrote "Systema Naturae" in 1735. He was the first to use the modern system of taxonomy, which is still used today.

R.C Majumdar says, one to the north of salt range in Punjab; a second in the Kalinga which has been identified with modern Singapuram in Kalinga (northern Orissa) between Chicacole and Narasannapeta; and third in the Radha, generally identified with Singur of Hooghly district. From the Lakhmandal inscription, it is clear that Simhapura was in Punjab and was ruled by the Varman family, the only other Varman family, who belonged to Yadava race. There can therefore be hardly any doubt that these Varman rulers were an offshoot of the Yadava-Varman of Simhapura in the Punjab region.

The information about Yadava rulers of Simhapura in the Yamuna valley is extracted from Lakhmandal inscription of princess Ishvara. There has been mentioned of Simhapura kingdom, which spread from the Giri/Tonse river to the Ganga and from Lakhmandal to Ambala and Saharanpur in the plains.

The Varmans most probably came to Bengal in the train of Kalachuri Karna's invasion of Vanga. Vajravarman seems to have invaded southeastern Bengal from Orissa, probably following the same route as Rajendra Chola's army. It is quite likely that the Vajravarman accompanied Karna, stayed in Bengal, and at an opportune moment carved out an independent Kingdom for themselves.

Vajra Varman was the earliest ruler of this dynasty and victory over Vanga was achieved under his leadership. According to Mr. R.D Banerjee and Dr. D.C Ganguly Varman Kingdom in Eastern Bengal was founded by Vajravarman. The only record mentioning Vajra Varman's name is the Belava inscription, which praised him only as a poet, brave warrior, and an intellectual.

Adideva was minister of Vajra Varman, whose grandson Bhatta Bhavadeva served as the minister of war and peace under King Harivarman.

Jatavarman was the son of Vajravarman and it is believed that Jatavarman accompanied Karna in latter's expedition of Bengal.

The reference to Jatavarman's marriage with Virashri, daughter of Karna, and to Jatavarman's war with Kaivarta chief Divya, who wrested northern Bengal from the Palas, help us in fixing the date of Jatavarman's rise to power sometime in between 1050 and 1075 AD. He attacked Varendra with a hostility towards Buddhism. Though the Kaivarta regime there did not suffer any loss, a part of Buddhist monastery of Somapura was destroyed by fire set by Jatavarman's army.

The account of Jatavarman's military conquests is given in the Belava plate of Bhojavarman. Jatavarman's marriage with Karna's daughter Virashri was significant and was perhaps a great factor in the rise of the political fortunes of the Varman Dynasty.

Jatavarman's assault on Anga, as mentioned in the Belava plate, must have involved him in a struggle with the Pala Empire but he made himself powerful in the region after capturing the parts of Anga.

Jatavarman's other two adversaries were Govardhana and the King of Kamarupa. He snatched away a part of Pundravardhana , then under the sovereign rule of Kamarupa.

Harivarman, under whom Bhatta Bhavadeva of the Bhuvanesvara Prashasti served as the minister of war and peace. On the basis of the colophon of the manuscript it can be assumed that Harivarman had a long reign of 46 years. It confirms to the information of the Bhuvanesvara inscription, where it is recorded that he ruled for a long time.

Harivaman, having seen Ramapala's success in recovering northern Bengal, propitiated Ramapala in order to avoid a Pala attack on his territory. It is doubtful whether Harivarman extended his rule towards Orissa. There is reference to a son of Harivarman both in the Bhuvanesvara inscription and Vajrayogini plate, but hardly anything is known about him.

Samalavarman, another son of Jatavarman, was the next king. His name figures prominently in the genealogical accounts of the Vaidik Brahmins, who are said to have migrated to Bengal from Madhyadesha during his reign. There was matrimonial relation between the Varmans and the Lankan King Vijayabahu I; in all probability Trailokyasundari, daughter of Samalavarman, was married to the Lankan king.

Besides Bhojavarman, King Samalavarman had another son named Udayin, who is said to be a great warrior, whom none could approach in the battlefield.

Bhoja Varman, son of Samalavarman was the last independent ruler of Varman Dynasty and the Belava plate was issued in his fifth regnal year from the jayaskandhavara situated at Bikramapura. He was defeated by Vijaysena of Sena Dynasty and rule of Varmans over southeast Bengal came to an end.

At the equator, one complete rotation takes about 24 and a half days. At the poles, one rotation takes about 38 days. The difference in speeds is caused by the fact that the Sun is a ball of gas.

Cornelius Adam Igbudu

Cornelius Adam Igbudu (1914-1981) simply known as Adam Igbudu was the founding evangelist of the Anglican Adam Preaching Society (A.A.P.S), an evangelical group in the Nigerian Anglican Church.

In 1992, Professor Michael Y. Nabofa wrote a book about his life titled: "Adam: The Evangelist".
In May 1998, Professor Sam U. Erivwo wrote that Cornelius Adam Igbudu was held "in very high regard" by Bishop Agori Iwe, his contemporary.
In August 2022, Linus Edeigba also wrote a book about his life.
Today, the origin of several existing Nigerian independent churches, such as God's Grace Ministry led by D. D. Mimeyeraye (now known as D. D. Miyerijesu) and New Glory Revival Ministry led by S. U. Ayanyen, has been traced to the evangelistic ministry of Cornelius Adam Igbudu in the Nigerian Anglican Church.

In recognition of his evangelistic achievements in the Nigerian Anglican Church, Cornelius Adam Igbudu was promoted to the status of a saint and a church was named after him (St. Adam's Anglican Church at Oghio in the Olomu area of Delta State). A secondary school in Araya (Adam Igbudu Memorial Secondary School) was named after him, including a bible school in Emevor (Adam Igbudu Christian Institute).
The Anglican Adam Preaching Society (A.A.P.S) has not ended along with Cornelius Adam Igbudu in 1981. In fact, it has expanded over the years and, according to Professor Sam U. Erivwo, through this movement the Urhobo, the Isoko and the Itsekiri witnessed (and is still witnessing) unusual revival.

According to Professor Amos Utuama, the Isoko nation has long been evangelized, noting that as far back as 1950, they had a great Evangelist in the person of late Cornelius Adam Igbudu.
He was credited with healing ability.

He was said to have "visited church after church winning converts and strengthening believers".
He was also said to have had a disagreement with a prominent Nigerian Isoko cleric, Archbishop Christian Aggrey Apena, whom he accused of "disturbing his ministry" in the Nigerian Anglican Church.

He was also said to have "left unbeatable legacies in the Christian race in Isoko".

Archbishop Cyril Odutemu was born on 2 May 1972 at a crusade ground during the evangelical exploits of the late popular evangelist, Cornelius Adam Igbudu.

On 30 October 2023, Cornelius Adam Igbudu's contribution to the spread of Christianity in Nigeria was again recognized and he was also described as "Isoko's greatest evangelist".

Charles's law

Charles's Law is a basic law in physics and chemistry. It describes the relationship between the temperature and volume of a gas, if the pressure and amount of gas do not change. It is also known as the Law of Charles and Gay-Lussac or the Law of Volumes.

According to Charles's Law, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature when measured at a constant pressure. In other words, as the temperature of a gas increases, its volume increases, and as the temperature decreases, its volume decreases. This relationship can be written mathematically as:

V₁ / T₁ = V₂ / T₂

where V₁ and T₁ are the initial volume and temperature, and V₂ and T₂ are the final volume and temperature.

Charles's Law assumes that the pressure and amount of gas do not change. In reality, pressure can influence the behavior of gases, so the ideal gas law, which uses all three variables (pressure, volume, and temperature), often describes gas behavior more accurately.

Charles's Law is particularly useful in applications involving the expansion or contraction of gases due to temperature changes, such as in gas thermometers or the behavior of gases in various engineering processes.

Wood flooring

Wood flooring is a type of covering made from timber, used for either structural or decorative purposes. Wood is a popular material for flooring due to its variety in styles, colors, cuts, and species. While bamboo flooring is often grouped with wood flooring, it's actually made from bamboo, not timber.

Different types of finishes can be used on wood flooring. These include polyurethane, natural substances like shellac and varnishes, and oils. Some floors are also made smooth with brushing and oiling. Older wood floors usually need a process called buffing every few years to keep them smooth. This doesn't apply to floors made in factories. If wood floors get too old or worn, they may need to be refinished. This involves a process called sanding to make them smooth and look new again. In the past, floors were scraped to bring out fresh wood, but this can leave scratches. Now, we have machines to do this job more neatly.

Tar pit

Decayed organic matter is in the ground as well as soil and clay. Under pressure, the organic matter can change to oil. The crude oil seeps upward through fractures, or porous sedimentary rock layers. It may form a pool at the surface. 

The lighter parts of the crude oil evaporate into the atmosphere. That leaves behind behind a black, sticky asphalt. Tar pits are often dug into because they contain many fossils.

There are not many tar pits in the world, because they only form in these circumstances. The lighter elements in the crude oil evaporate. This makes sticky tar. The sticky tar may trap animals. Their distress calls are irresistible to the predators which follow them.

User Account Control

User Account Control (UAC) is a feature in some Windows computers that helps protect a computer from harmful programs. It does this by asking for permission before letting a program do something that could change or damage the computer. For example, when installing a new game or changing some settings, a UAC window will pop up and ask you if you are sure you want to do that. This way, you can avoid accidentally letting a bad program mess up your computer.

UAC can be set up to need an administrator’s approval before letting a program do something that could change or damage the computer. An administrator is someone who has more power and control over the computer than a regular user. For example, your parents might be administrators on your computer, but you might not be. If UAC is configured to need admin approval, it will ask you to enter an administrator’s password or click on an administrator’s name before letting you proceed. This way, only people who have the right to make changes to your computer can do so.

Today, approximately 400 members of the nomadic Jarawa tribe live in groups of 40-50 people in chaddhas – as they call their homes.

Like most tribal peoples who live self-sufficiently on their ancestral lands, the Jarawa continue to thrive, and their numbers are steadily growing.

They hunt pig and turtle and fish with bows and arrows in the coral-fringed reefs for crabs and fish, including striped catfish-eel and the toothed pony fish. They also gather fruits, wild roots, tubers and honey. The bows are made from the chooi wood, which does not grow throughout the Jarawa territory.

In the first part of the show, Abhinaya is a traditional girl who follows her customs and traditions. She meets Vetri, who is a rebellious person and doesn't understand the importance of traditions and marriage. During an argument at a temple, Vetri unexpectedly ties a sacred thread called "thali" around Abhinaya's neck. The story follows their journey as they try to overcome their differences and discover love.

The second part takes place six years later. Vetri has been in prison for a crime he committed. When he is released, he tries to find Abhinaya but learns that she has moved far away and had an abortion, ending their unborn child's life. Two years pass, and Abhinaya has become an important government official, while Vetri has become a notorious troublemaker due to his grief over their child's fate. However, Abhinaya actually didn't abort the child, and she is determined to keep Vetri away from their daughter Sudar. The story focuses on how Sudar brings her parents back together.

There was a smart woman named Abhinaya who liked to follow her family's customs. One day, she met a rough guy named Vetri who didn't understand how important it was to follow the proper rules for getting married. Abhinaya helped a couple get married in a temple, and that's when a fortune teller came and said that Abhinaya would marry a troublemaker, even if she didn't believe it.

Abhinaya was trying to help a couple who got married secretly. While they were arguing, Vetri got angry and put a special necklace called a thaali around Abhinaya's neck. He felt sorry for it later, though. Abhinaya's father and Vetri were upset when they forced her to go live in a poor area as a newlywed, even though she was surprised and sad about it. Vetri didn't listen when Abhinaya tried to explain the meaning of love to him. But Abhinaya discovered the truth about Vetri and why he changed so suddenly. She also found out that her friend Radha secretly loved Vetri.

As time went on, Vetri and Abhinaya went through many ups and downs that brought them closer together. Vetri even said that he liked Abhinaya when she was taken away. But they were not allowed to enter their house. However, Vetri's other family members agreed to let them live on the terrace next to the house. Will Vetri and Abhinaya be accepted as a couple and live together? That's the big question. The rest of the story is about whether they can solve their problems and be together.

Abhi and Vetri were apart for a long time, but now they meet each other again. Something called destiny gives them another opportunity to be together. Will the same things that happened before happen again?

In Andhra Pradesh, Abhi is now a collector, whereas Vetri was recently let out of prison after serving his time. When he is released from prison, he wants to visit Abhi and his daughter but learns that Abhi has moved away and that his daughter was aborted. As a result, Vetri adopts new negative habits and returns to his previous brash behaviour.

After a big fight with a powerful person in Andhra Pradesh, a person named Abhi is transferred by the government back to Kanchipuram. In Kanchipuram, it is discovered that Abhi did not end the life of her child named Sudar, who is still alive. Meanwhile, a person named Vetri becomes a troublemaker in his hometown of Kanchipuram. One day, a riot breaks out at a temple and Abhi orders Vetri to open it, but Vetri disobeys. After 8 years, Abhi learns about the riot and tries to stop it. This leads to Abhi having Vetri arrested, but Vetri is released on bail with the help of Kanmani, a girl whom Vetri educated to become a lawyer and who has feelings for Vetri. After the legal case is resolved, Vetri challenges Abhi to defeat him, while another person named Nandhini wants to confess to Abhi that she killed someone named Bhavani. However, Vetri interrupts and tells Nandhini to leave.

Paramu is planning to have Vetri killed because Vetri killed Paramu's twin brother, Bhavani. Paramu sends his gang to attack Vetri, but Sudar warns Vetri about the danger. Vetri fights off the gang members, but Sudar gets hurt in the process. Despite the injury, Vetri appreciates Sudar a lot and starts treating her like a very important person in his life. They spend a lot of time together and become very close, without realizing that Vetri is Sudar's father and Sudar is Vetri's daughter. Sudar also helps Vetri quit his bad habits of smoking and drinking, and he becomes a better person because of her.

In the second part of the story, Sudar works to bring Vetri and Abhi back together. This is the main focus of the story's second part.




In the promo video, Vetri who argued with a couple who were running away to get married at a temple. Vetri said their love marriage wasn't valid and tried to take the thali off the woman's neck. Then, Abhinaya came and stopped him. She got angry and slapped him. In his anger, Vetri took the thali from a goddess named Amman and put it on Abhinaya's neck. He said, "Just tying a yellow rope is enough. Now I will be your husband. I've also put a Bindi on your forehead. Go away!"

Foot

Land vertebrates have feet. The organization of their feet varies. Two factors come into play: weight and lifestyle. 

1. Plantigrade: heavy animals usually put their heels down to support their weight.

2. Unguligrade: large animals with hooves. 

3. Digitigrade is usually reserved for lighter animals. It means to walk on the toes.

Most heavy animals walk on four legs. There are some exceptions. Some really heavy birds move or moved on two legs. Moas are one example and ostriches run very well on two legs. 

Birds generally are an example of the change from quadruped walk (originally as dinosaurs), to bipedalism. Humans are also examples of changes that started in arboreal apes. 

The study of such things is called "comparative foot morphology".

Cúc Phương National Park

Cúc Phương National Park () is a park in Vietnam. It is in Ninh Bình Province, in the Red River Delta. Cuc Phuong was Vietnam's first national park. It is the largest nature reserve in Vietnam.

Cúc Phương was made into a forest reserve in 1960. Human beings have lived in this place since 7,000-12,000 years ago. Modern people have found things that belonged to ancient people in caves in the park: places where human bodies are buried, stone axes, bone spears, oyster shell knives, and tools for turning food into powder. In 1789, Nguyễn Huệ and Thăng Long fought a Vietnamese Civil War battle in the Quen Voi part of the park. In modern times, the 2,500 Muong people who live, farm, and hunt in the park have disagreed with the government of Vietnam. In 1987, the government made 500 Muong move away from the park because they were catching animals and using the land in ways the government did not allow.

Cúc Phương is in the hills of the northern Annamite Mountain Range. The park has mountains with karst rock and valleys with plants in them. The lowest elevation is 150 meters (500 feet) above sea level and the highest is 656 m (2,152 feet), at the summit of May Bac Mountain, or Silver Cloud Mountain. The limestone mountains have many caves, and visitors can go into some of them.

The average temperature in Cúc Phương is 21 Celsius (70 Fahrenheit), 9C (48F) in the winter. The highest temperatures can be over 30C (85 F) and lows are just above zero (32 F). In the valleys, the weather is hot and humid. High in the hills, the temperature drops are low enough for people to get frostbite. It rains more than 200 days a year and the average annual rainfall is 2,100mm (7 feet). The dry season is November to February.

The park has 97 species of mammals. Endangered langurs live in the park. The park has 300 species of birds; 36 reptiles; 17 amphibians; 11 fish; 2,000 species of plants with veinss, and thousands of species of insects. Many of them are on Vietnam's Red Book of endangered species.
The park has some Northern Vietnam lowland rain forests and Northern Indochina subtropical forests.

There are many apes and monkeyss in the park: macaques, gibbon, François's leaf monkey and the slow loris.
It also has bats, porcupines, flying squirrels, small striped squirrels, belly-banded squirrels, and the black giant squirrels. The park used to have Asiatic black bears, wild dogs, elephants, rhinos, and tigers, but human beings either killed them or killed the animals they eat Leopards, clouded leopards, and jungle cats may still live in the park, but scientists are not sure.

Many birds live in the park: bar-backed partridges, scaly-breasted partridges, silver pheasants, red junglefowl, grey peacock-pheasants, laughingthrushes, red-vented barbets, green-eared barbets, scimitar-billed babblers, brown boobooks, scarlet minivets, racket-tailed drongos, racket-tailed treepies, white-winged blue magpies. Some birds only live there for part of the year: thrushes, flycatchers, tits, finches, and pipits. People have also seen hornbills in the forest.

There is one subspecies of underground cave fish is also found in the park. It is also the place where scientists first found many invertebrate species, including "Zaxiphidiopsis bazyluki".

Many plants grow in the park, which has a multi-layered canopy. Tall trees can be 70m high. It also has many flowers, including, orchids; and an abundance of liana and cauliflory. The ferns have very tall leaves. Some of the plants are good spices, medicines, and edible fruits, nuts and shoots.

There are three conservation programs in the Cúc Phương National park:

The primate center has langurs, loris, and gibbon species, include the Delacour's langur, golden-headed langur, and black crested gibbon. These three species are critically endangered. The Frankfurt Zoological Society helped make the center in 1993. It has 180 animals in 50 cages, 4 houses, and two semi-wild places surrounded by fences.
The Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program (CPCP) works with small meat-eating animals: (civets, linsangs, small cats, weasels, otters and badgers) and pangolins in Vietnam. The program started in 1995, but then it was only for Owston's civet. In 2006, the program started working with Vietnam's two species of pangolin, the Chinese pangolin and the Sunda pangolin. All of these species are threatened by the illegal wildlife trade.

The CPCP rescues animals that have been caught illegally by human beings. It teaches the animals to live in the wild again and teaches people about the animals.

People started the turtle conservation center in 1998. It has the most endangered turtles in Vietnam, including the Vietnamese pond turtle which is nearly extinct in the wild.

Many visitors like come to Cúc Phương National Park. It is one of the most popular nature places in Vietnam. Tens of thousands of Vietnamese and many people from other places visit the park each year. There are places to eat and sleep in the park and nearby. There is a paved road through the park and many hiking paths. Park rangers guard Cuc Phuong and tourists can pay them to show them places to see.

Operation Blitz

Operation Blitz was a military operation carried out by Pakistan, a country in Asia, in the early 1970s. This operation, also known as Operation Searchlight, started fighting between Pakistan and what is now the country of Bangladesh. Operation Bltiz was an important event that happened before the Bangladeshi War of Independence.

The origins of Operation Blitz can be traced back to the 1970 general elections in Pakistan. The Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, won a landslide victory in East Pakistan, which fueled demands for greater autonomy and eventually led to calls for an independent state. However, the West Pakistani establishment, fearing the loss of control and unwilling to accept the democratic mandate of the East, launched Operation Blitz on the night of March 25, 1971.

Under the guise of restoring law and order, the Pakistani military initiated a massive operation targeting political dissidents, intellectuals, and Bengali nationalists. The operation aimed to suppress the growing movement for autonomy and independence in East Pakistan. Troops were deployed throughout the region, and a systematic campaign of violence, torture, and mass killings was unleashed on the population.

Operation Blitz resulted in widespread atrocities and human rights abuses. The military engaged in indiscriminate violence, targeting civilians and committing acts of rape, arson, and murder. Bengali women were particularly vulnerable to sexual violence, which was used as a weapon to terrorize the population. Estimates of the number of people killed during the operation vary widely, with some sources suggesting that up to three million people lost their lives.

The brutal tactics employed by the Pakistani military in Operation Blitz drew international condemnation. As news of the atrocities reached the international community, global public opinion turned against Pakistan. Human rights organizations, journalists, and activists exposed the violence and called for action to end the bloodshed.

The military crackdown, however, had unintended consequences. It galvanized the resistance movement in East Pakistan and led to the formation of the Mukti Bahini, a guerrilla force fighting for independence. The Bengali people, who had initially sought greater autonomy, were now united in their struggle for complete liberation from West Pakistan.

The military campaign initiated by Operation Blitz soon escalated into a full-fledged war between Pakistan and the Bengali nationalist forces. With the support of India, the Mukti Bahini fought against the Pakistani army. The conflict witnessed large-scale military operations, guerilla warfare, and significant civilian suffering.

After nine months of intense fighting, Pakistan finally surrendered to the combined forces of the Mukti Bahini and the Indian Army on December 16, 1971. The independent nation of Bangladesh was born, marking the end of Operation Blitz and the beginning of a new chapter in the region's history.

Operation Blitz remains a dark chapter in Pakistan's history, symbolizing the devastating consequences of political repression and the struggle for self-determination. The operation's impact continues to resonate, reminding the world of the importance of safeguarding human rights, promoting democracy, and preventing such atrocities from occurring in the future.

Cardiac rehabilitation

Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation (also known as Cardiac Rehabilitation or Pulmonary Rehabilitation) is a multidisciplinary program aimed at improving the overall physical health and well-being of individuals with heart or lung conditions. It encompasses a comprehensive approach that combines exercise training, education, and counseling to aid in the recovery from cardiac or pulmonary events, manage symptoms, and enhance the quality of life for patients.

Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation is a specialized program designed to optimize functional capacity and reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events or respiratory complications. It is tailored to meet the individual needs and condition of each patient and is typically conducted in a supervised, outpatient setting. However, depending on the circumstances, it can also be provided in a hospital or home-based environment.

Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programs consist of several key components that work together to address the physical, emotional, and educational needs of patients. These components include:

Exercise is a fundamental aspect of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation. It helps improve cardiovascular and respiratory function, enhance muscular strength and endurance, and promote overall fitness. The exercise program is carefully prescribed and supervised by healthcare professionals, such as physiotherapists or exercise physiologists, who monitor patients' progress and adjust the intensity and duration of the exercises as needed.

Education and counseling play crucial roles in empowering patients to effectively manage their condition. Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programs provide education on topics such as risk factors, medication management, dietary modifications, and stress reduction strategies. Counseling sessions, both individual and group-based, address the emotional and psychological aspects of living with heart or lung disease, helping patients cope with anxiety, depression, and lifestyle changes.

Promoting healthy lifestyle changes is a key component of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation. This includes programs aimed at smoking cessation, nutritional counseling, weight management, and stress reduction. The goal is to empower patients to make long-term lifestyle modifications that promote overall well-being and reduce the risk of further complications.

Recognizing the emotional and psychological impact of heart or lung disease, cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programs provide psychosocial support to patients and their families. Support groups, individual counseling, and resources for family members are often offered to address the emotional and social needs of patients. This support network helps individuals cope with the challenges they face, fostering a positive outlook and improving overall well-being.

Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation offers numerous benefits to individuals with heart or lung conditions, including:

Regular exercise and rehabilitation interventions lead to increased exercise tolerance, reduced fatigue, and improved overall physical function. These improvements enable individuals to engage in daily activities with greater ease and independence.

Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation helps manage risk factors associated with heart or lung disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, and obesity. By addressing these risk factors and adopting a healthy lifestyle, individuals can reduce their risk of future cardiovascular events or respiratory complications.

Heart or lung conditions can significantly impact a person's quality of life. Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation aims to improve physical, emotional, and social well-being, helping individuals regain confidence and enjoy a better quality of life.

Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programs focus not only on short-term recovery but also on long-term health maintenance. By equipping individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to manage their condition, they are empowered to continue practicing healthy behaviors and reduce the risk of future complications.

Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation is a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach that aims to improve the physical and emotional well-being of individuals with heart or lung conditions. Through exercise training, education, counseling, and lifestyle modification, this program provides the necessary tools for patients to regain their health, manage their symptoms, and lead fulfilling lives. Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation plays a vital role in the continuum of care for individuals with cardiac or pulmonary diseases, promoting long-term health maintenance and preventing future complications.

Socialist Workers Party (UK)

The Socialist Workers Party (SWP) is a far-left political party in the United Kingdom. Founded as the Socialist Review Group by supporters of Tony Cliff in 1950, it became the International Socialists in 1962 and the SWP in 1977. The party says it is Trotskyist. Cliff and his followers criticised the Soviet Union and its satellites, calling them state capitalist rather than socialist countries.

It set up the Anti Nazi League in the Autumn of 1977 and then Rock Against Racism. This organised successful carnivals with The Clash, the Buzzcocks, Steel Pulse, X-Ray Spex, The Ruts, Generation X and the Tom Robinson Band. It stopped in 1981 after the National Front had got smaller. 

Associated Television

Associated Television was the original name of the British broadcaster ATV. ATV was a part of the ITV network. They served London on weekends from 1955 until 1968 and the Midlands on weekdays from 1956 to 1968. After 1968 they would serve only the Midlands every day of the week until 1982.

The company was formed by the merging of the "Associated Broadcasting Development Company" (ABDC) and the "Incorporated Television Programme Company" (ITC).

The new company was originally called the "Associated Broadcasting Company" (ABC), but the Associated British Picture Corporation wished to call their station "ABC" and they ran a large chain of cinemas under the name ABC. They successfully sued for ownership of the ABC name, causing the Associated Broadcasting Company to rebrand three weeks after starting the London weekend service changed their name to Associated TeleVision Ltd (ATV). The logo made for ABC was tweaked for ATV. The shadowed eye was inspired by the CBS logo in the US and was designed by Lew Grades on a transatlantic flight.

ABC started to air programs in the London region on Saturday 24 September 1955, after a joint production for the network's opening night on Thursday 22 September. ABC would be seen until Saturday 8 October where it would be changed to ATV. ATV won two contracts from the ITA, one for London weekends and one for Midlands weekdays. The Midlands service launched on 17 February 1956, with ABC Weekend providing the weekend service.

ATV quickly ran into financial difficulty due to the losses of the first two years of ITV as well as start-up costs. Associated-Rediffusion (The London weekday provider) took on some of the losses of ATV and the Daily Mirror bought shares in ATV to help the company. The company changed structure many times until 1966, when ATV and ITC became subsidiaries of the Associated Communications Corporation. This marked the point where Lew Grade took control of the company rather than the greatest influence.

ATV had a large impact in variety and light entertainment.

ATV lost the contract for the London weekend to the London Weekend Consortium. They renamed themselves to London Weekend Television before launching in 1968. The Midlands contract was renewed and ATV would now broadcast to the Midlands every day of the week. By this point the company was renamed "ATV Network Limited".

During the 1970s, ATV was criticised over its lack of programs for the region, mainly for the east of the region. The critics held that local programs made by ATV had a focus on Birmingham. In 1980, the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) decided that the franchise candidate for the Midlands should have separate facilities in the East and West Midlands, partly because of criticism of ATV.

"ATV Midlands Limited", was a shell company created by the ACC only for the franchise, applied for the contract and won. However, the ACC were required to sell 49% of the company, sell the Elstree studios and rename the company to show that it was a new company.

ATV ended broadcasting on 1 January 1982 at 12:34am, following the Scottish Television production Hogmanay Show. The final shutdown was made as a brief tribute to ATV from one of the original announcers Shaw Taylor before Mike Prince signed off with the national anthem (an organ version recorded at St. Chad's Cathedral).

The shadowed eye was in use from the stations founding in 1955 as ABC to the stations last moments on air as ATV in 1982. After 1969, ATV used two main idents, one in colour, appearing before a programme in colour and a black and white one, used before programmes made or shown in black and white.

ATV used many names during its life, the company names were:

ATV also used many names that were seen on TV screens:

The basic approach of linking development promotion with loans and valuable investments initially met with skepticism from church financial and development experts. Initially, some people did not feel comfortable giving loans to disadvantaged people instead of donations. Others disagreed with investing the church's money in something believed to be unlikely to work and yield no financial profit. However, many people from churches throughout Europe believed in the idea of Oikocredit and established Oikocredit support groups in the late 1970s. Through these support groups, private individuals, church communities, associations, foundations, and other organizations could invest in Oikocredit, which had previously been reserved for churches. Today, the support groups provide the majority of Oikocredit's member capital.


The human rights organizations LICADHO, Equitable Cambodia and FIAN, have accused Oikocredit of providing loans in Cambodia that allegedly led to forced land sales. The accusation is that despite evidence of a debt crisis since at least 2017, investments in Cambodian microfinance institutions continued. In response Oikocredit said, that they had not identified any forced land sales and that customer protection is their top priority.

Vampyrius

<mapframe latitude="12.86536" longitude="108.116455" zoom="2" text="Map of Vietnam, with rectangles showing approximate range of R. Vampyrus." width="200" height="100">
</mapframe>
Rhacophorus vampyrus (Vampyrius vampyrus) is a flying frog. It lives in Vietnam. It is the only frog species in its genus. People also call it the vampire tree frog or vampire flying frog. This is because the tadpoles have two black hooks in their mouths that look like vampire teeth. Its Vietnamese name is "Ếch cây ma cà rồng".

This frog lives in evergreen forests on mountains at 1470–2004 meters above sea level. It lives in trees. It can use the webbed skin on its feet to glide between trees. This is why it is called a flying frog.

Scientists call this frog both "Rhacophorus vampyrus" and "Vampyrius vampyrus" in the articles they write.

The first specimen was discovered in 2008 by Jodi Rowley of the Australian Museum at Sydney, Australia, and her student Le Thi Thuy Duong from Ho Chi Minh City University of Science. They found more in 2009 and 2010, and their team wrote the first paper about the species in the journal "Zootaxa" in 2010. They called it "Rhacophorus vampyrus". In 2012, scientists said this species should be called "Rhacophorus calcaneus" because of the shapes of the adult frogs' bodies; however, in 2014 the species was reclassified as "R. vampyrus" through phylogenic research. In 2021, a phylogenetic study found the species to fall far outside "Rhacophorus", and instead be the sister genus to "Gracixalus", so scientists gave it its own genus, "Vampyrius".

"R. vampyrus" can grow to 4.5 cm. There is webbed skin between the toes, so it can glide between trees. The skin of the frog's back is copper-brown in color with fainter, dark-brown mottling. The chest and belly are white, with a some black marks at the edge of the chest. The upper surfaces of the arms and legs are copper brown with some dark brown marks. The upper surfaces of the front and back feet are copper brown in color which fades to pinkish-cream or grey at the toes. The lower surfaces of the front and back feet are a pale grey color. The upper surface of webbing of the hands and feet is dark grey to black in color. The lower surfaces of the species are grey. "R. vampyrus" has pale yellow/gold irises with a small rim of blue. There is also a pointed piece sticking out at tibiotarsal articulation. Tadpoles have black hooks on their mouths made of keratin, which is the same thing fingernails are made of. The tadpoles have long bodies and long tails. They are dark brown in color, but sometimes the tail fins have no color. The tadpoles' eyes are black. The iris of the eye has gold specks.

So far, people have only found "R. vampyrus" in southern Vietnam. The first specimens were found in Bidoup Núi Bà National Park, but scientists think they may also live in many parts of the Langbian Plateau (specifically in Chư Yang Sin National Park and Phước Bình National Park). Later, scientists found them in Ta Dung Nature reserve, Dak Glong District. The area that "R. vampyrus" extends is approximately 2,082 km. The two places where "R. vampyrus" lives are far apart. The space in between has low elevation, which would make it hard for the frog to live there or travel. Scientists think it used to live in more places, but human beings changed the places where it lives.

"R. vampyrus" lays its eggs in small, water-filled holes in trees during the rainy seasons, generally 0.3–1.2 m above the ground. It lays eggs mostly from July to May, producing clutches of 250 eggs or fewer. The eggs are laid in foam nests on the wall of the tree hole, where nests are usually about 30–120 cm above the ground. The larvae fall into a hollow basin filled with water. Tadpoles develop from the colorless eggs, but fertilized and unfertilized eggs are the same size. The eggs are white in color, with a thin transparent covering on the outside shell of each egg, with diameters between 0.70 and 1.29 mm. The tadpoles are long and dark-brown in color. Their tails are about three times as long as their bodies. Younger tadpoles are pale white or gray in color and they become darker over time. The tadpoles have dark hooks on their lower jaws that look like fanged teeth. This is the only frog or toad that has fangs like these. There is also a hard arch on the upper jaw. The two hooks go forward. The species is named after these "fangs."

The hooks on the tadpoles' mouths show that they eat eggs and only eggs. The mother frog lays extra unfertilized eggs (to feed them). This is an example of advanced parental care. The tadpoles can open their mouths very wide, so they can eat large things, for examples eggs with a jelly coating still on. The tadpoles' intestine pouches can also stretch very wide to hold many eggs. It shrinks when the tadpole does not eat.

In 2014, the IUCN Red List named "Rhacophorus vampyrus" endangered. "R. vampyrus" has two main populations and they live far away from each other because the land in between is not a good habitat for this frog. Scientists think the frogs in the two groups cannot mate with each other unless human beings take frogs from place to place, but no one has tried this yet. "R. vampyrus" needs to live in moist and dense mountain rainforests. Threats such as cutting down forests, road building, farming, and water farming can changes the area. There are fewer of these frogs than there were. including "R. vampyrus". 
The two places where scientists found this frog are already protected: Bidoup-Nui National Park and Ta Dung Nature Reserve. "R. vampyrus" may live in other areas, for example Chu Yang Sin National Park and Phuoc Binh National Park. Scientists do not know as much as they want to know about this frog, which may make it harder to protect it.


Tommy Kane

Thomas Henry Kane (born January 14, 1964 in Montreal) is an Canadian former football wide receiver and convicted murderer.

Kane was drafted out of the Syracuse by the Seattle Seahawks with the 75th pick in the third round of the 1988 NFL Draft. Kane played 57 games with the Seahawks but his NFL career was cut short because of injuries. The Seahawks released him and he joined to Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL) in 1994. He only played 5 games for the Argonauts and retired shortly after.

On November 30, 2003, Kane stabbed his wife Tammara Shaikh to death. He pled guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison. He was ordered by a judge to pay $590,000 to his wife's family.

On 2018, he was given six months of day parole. In May 2019, he was sent back to jail for violating his release.


Peritoneal dialysis

Peritoneal dialysis is a method of treating kidney failure by utilizing the peritoneum, the lining of the abdomen, to internally filter the blood. Before commencing peritoneal dialysis, a surgeon inserts a soft tube called a catheter into the belly.

During the treatment, a dialysis solution consisting of water, salt, and other additives is introduced into the belly through the catheter from a bag. Once the bag is empty, it is disconnected, and a cap is placed on the catheter, allowing the individual to freely move around and engage in normal activities. While inside the belly, the dialysis solution absorbs waste and excess fluid from the body.

A diagram illustrating peritoneal dialysis showcases the connection between the bag of dialysis solution and the catheter entering the abdominal cavity, highlighting the peritoneum.

After a few hours, the solution, along with the accumulated waste, is drained from the belly into an empty bag. The used solution can be disposed of in a toilet or tub. The process is then repeated with a fresh bag of dialysis solution. Fresh solution exhibits a higher efficiency in waste absorption, but over time, its filtering ability decreases. Hence, the process of emptying the used solution and refilling the belly with fresh solution needs to be repeated four to six times daily, which is referred to as an exchange.

Exchanges can be performed during the day or at night using a machine that facilitates fluid pumping in and out. It is crucial to adhere to the prescribed exchange regimen for optimal outcomes. While dialysis can enhance well-being and prolong life, it does not serve as a cure for kidney failure.

Grant-maintained school

Grant-maintained schools or GM schools were state schools in England and Wales between 1988 and 1998 that had opted out of local government control, being funded directly by a grant from central government. Some of these schools had selective admissions procedures.

Light beer

Light beer is the name for beer that either has less alcohol, or fewer calories than regular beer. Light beer with less alcohol is made in a special process, either the fermentation is stopped, or the alcohol is later extracted. This is similar to making alcohol-free beer. Light beers are sometimes criticised, because some of them have "less taste" than regular beers. Light beers contain up to 30% less alcohol than regular beers. Regular beer contains between 4 and 6 percent alcohol by volume, light beer usually contains 2-3%.

Large-scale production of light beers in the United States started in the mid-1970s. The first brewery to sell light beer was Coors Brewing Company, who sold Coors Light in the 1940s, during World War II.

Beer with less alcohol is very popular in the United States. 

IP code

The IP code or ingress protection code refers to a standardized rating system used to measure the level of protection provided by an enclosure against the intrusion of solid objects and liquids. It is particularly relevant in the context of electronic devices, outdoor equipment, and industrial machinery.

The IP rating consists of two digits, each representing a specific type of protection. The first digit indicates the degree of protection against solid objects, such as dust, dirt, and accidental contact. It ranges from 0 to 6, with higher numbers indicating a higher level of protection.

The second digit signifies the degree of protection against liquids, such as water and moisture. It ranges from 0 to 9, with higher numbers indicating a higher level of protection. A rating of 0 denotes no protection, while a rating of 9 indicates protection against powerful water jets or submersion for extended periods.

By referring to the IP rating of a device or equipment, you can determine its ability to withstand various environmental conditions. For example, a waterproof Bluetooth speaker with an IP68 rating implies that it is dust-tight and can be submerged in water up to a certain depth without being damaged.

Yadavs of Devagiri

The Seuna, Sevuna, Gavli Ahir kings or Yadavs of Devagiri was an Indian dynasty, that existed from the mid-9th to mid 14th century. At its peak, the kingdom stretched from the Tungabhadra to the Narmada rivers, including present-day Maharashtra, north Karnataka and parts of Madhya Pradesh. The capital was at Devagiri (present-day Daulatabad in Maharashtra). The Yadavas initially ruled as feudatories of the Western Chalukyas. Around the middle of the 12th century, they declared independence and established independence that reached its peak under Singhana II.

According to local tradition, the town of Sinnar was established by the Gavali (Yadava) chief Rav Singuni. His son Rav Govinda built the great temple of Gondeshwara or Govindeshwara, at a cost of 2 lakh rupees. Traditionally, Seuna Yadavas are called "Gavli Kings". Bhillama V (1185–93) moved their capital from Sinnar, near Nashik, to Devagiri. They were also known as Gollas in Andhra Pradesh, who were hostile to the Hoysalas. Like Hoysala Yadavas, Seunas Yadavas were also originally pastoralists or cattle-herders. The Yadavas often proudly claimed their pastoral ancestry.

Taruga (frog)

Taruga is a genus of frogs in the family Rhacophoridae. They live in Sri Lanka.

Scientists used to call "Taruga" "Polypedates". "Taruga" has three species in it: "T. fastigo", "T. eques", and "T. longinasus". The frogs in "Taruga" have cone-shaped flesh around their vent.

"Taruga" in Sanskrit (and early-Sinhala) means "tree climber." These frogs live in trees and do not come to the ground. They even lay their eggs in plants that reach out over water.

All three frogs need shade from tree branches for adults to live, and they need shallow, slow-moving streams or puddles to lay eggs.

The female frog builds a foamy nest on a plant that hangs over water. The eggs develop for a few days, and then the tadpoles fall into water. The young frogs that climb out of the water climb up into the trees life.

There are three species in this genus:


Exit poll

An election exit poll is a poll of voters taken right after they leave the polling stations. These polls are usually done by private companies working for newspapers or broadcasters. Exit polls can show somewhat how an election went before the election results are announced. This is helpful because it may take hours to count the votes for many elections.


Mike Pence 2024 presidential campaign

The Mike Pence 2024 presidential campaign began on June 5, 2023, when former Vice President of the United States Mike Pence filed his candidacy for the 2024 United States presidential election with the Federal Election Commission. He officially announced his campaign at a rally in Iowa on June 7, 2023. Polling put Pence far behind former President of the United States Donald Trump and incumbent Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis. This caused political analysts to say that his chances of winning the Republican Party nomination were rather low.

Pence ended his campaign on October 28, 2023 after low polling numbers.

Mises Caucus

The Libertarian Party Mises Caucus (LPMC), also known as the Mises Caucus, is a political faction and caucus of the Libertarian Party. It was founded in 2017 by the paleolibertarian faction of the party. It was inspired by the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns of Ron Paul. The Mises Caucus got total control of the Libertarian National Committee (LNC) in 2022. This caused a conflict between the LPMC and the Classical Liberal Caucus (CLC).

The founder and chairman of the LPMC is Michael Heise of the Mises Institute. He founded the caucus in response to the struggle between classical liberals and paleolibertarians in August 2017 triggered by the Unite the Right rally. Since then, many notable people in the Libertarian Party have joined it. Some of these people are Ron Paul, Dave Smith, Tom Woods, and Scott Horton. Angela McArdle, Chairwoman of the LNC, is a member of the LPMC as well.

In August 2017, the Unite the Right rally occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia to protest the proposed removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. Jeff Deist, the President of the Mises Institute, supported the protest. The LNC heavily scrutinized the Mises Institute as a result, accusing Deist of being a White nationalist. The caucus is widely described as white nationalist. The struggle that followed between self-described classical liberals and self-described paleolibertarians resulted in Michael Heise and the latter founding the Mises Caucus.

In 2022, the Mises Caucus took control of the highest positions of power throughout the LNC. Angela McArdle of the Mises Caucus was elected the new Chairwoman of the Libertarian Party with 69% of the delegates. The former leadership of the party became heavily critical of the new LPMC leadership, forming the Classical Liberal Caucus in reaction. In spite of resistance from the CLC, the LPMC used their power in the LNC to bring the Libertarian Party into the anti-war movement. The Libertarian Party began working with the People's Party to organize new anti-war protests. This resulted in Rage Against the War Machine, a major anti-war rally in Washington, D.C. on February 19, 2023. The rally focused primarily on the United States' involvement in the Russo-Ukrainian War and the torture of Julian Assange.

The Advisory Board is a group of 11 individuals who, alongside Chairman Michael Heise, run the Mises Caucus. The members are:


An offshoot of the Mises Caucus was founded within the Republican Party in 2021, known as the GOP Mises Caucus. The GOP Mises Caucus advocates for economic growth and tax resistance. It is a firm opponent of COVID-19 lockdowns, referring to it as the "Covid Regime."

In 2023, the Mises Caucus and the People's Party collaborated to launch an anti-war protest on February 19 known as Rage Against the War Machine.
