Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated

Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorcorated is an American children's mystery TV series. This is the eleventh series in the Scooby-Doo franchise. Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc. does some of the same things that older Scooby Doo shows did. For example, they would usually unmask the Monster and prove it was a hoax the same way that they did in the Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! show. It’s different from older shows because it has all the episodes be part of one story, has the characters not always get along (and also sometimes dating each other) and because it’s the first time that Scooby Doo has to fight real monsters since "The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo".

Just like the past series Mystery Inc. changes what the characters look like, but this time they have an old look with only small changes, like Velma now wearing bows in her hair.

Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby are a team of mystery solvers living in a small town of Crystal Cove, which people say is haunted. The town has a long history of strange disappearances and Ghosts and Monsters. A lot of tourists go to Crystal Cove to see the Ghosts and Monsters. Because of thisthe adults of the town (especially Fred's father Mayor Fred Jones Sr. and Sheriff Bronson Stone) are not happy that the kids are proving the monsters are fake.

The team also finds out that there is a dark secret that is hidden in the past of Crystal Cove. Following clues from a man who calls himself "Mr. E." , the gang learns the legend of a cursed Conquistador treasure, the secret history of Crystal Cove's founding Darrow Family, and the mysterious, unsolved disappearance of four mystery-solving kids and their pet bird—the first Mystery Incorporated. Solving this mystery is hard because of romance. : Shaggy has a hard time dating Velma while still being best friends with Scooby, while Daphne is in love with Fred, who loves to trap things and doesn’t realize that he’s in love with Daphne. 

The return of the original Mystery Incorporated to Crystal Cove begins a race between the two groups to find the pieces of a disk, which will point the way to the cursed treasure under the town. It turns out that these two groups are not the only teams of mystery-solvers that have lived in Crystal Cove: many other groups, always made up of four humans and an animal, have existed. And it turns out that the kids have to stop the End of the World.

The Magic School Bus (TV series)

The Magic School Bus is an American-Canadian animated children's television series, based on the book series of the same name by Joanna Cole and Bruce Degen. The series has received critical acclaim for its use of celebrity talent and combining entertainment with an educational series. "Broadcasting & Cable" said the show was "among the highest-rated PBS Kids shows for school-age children." A reboot titled "The Magic School Bus Rides Again" began on Netflix on September 29, 2017.

A cyborg named "Ms. Frizzle" embarks on exciting adventures with her pet chameleon called Liz Ard and her class known as the Frizzlers on her eponymous vintage Spanish steam-diesel hybrid autonomous school minibus referred as the Magic School Bus. As they journey on their secret field trips, they discover locations, creatures, time periods and more things to learn about the wonders of science along the way.


Scholastic Entertainment, Nelvana, Bardel Entertainment and PBS Kids made "The Magic School Bus" books into an animated television series. It began on September 10, 1994. Many parents and teachers wanted Scholastic Entertainment, Nelvana, Bardel Entertainment and PBS Kids to help girls and minorities learn more about science. Scholastic Entertainment, Nelvana, Bardel Entertainment and PBS Kids president Deborah Forte, Patrick Loubert, Delna Bhesenia and Pamela Aguilar said that making the books into an animated series helped kids "learn about science in a fun way".
Each episode of the series ran for 30 minutes. There was a "Producer Says" part at the end of each episode when "The Magic School Bus" had no advertisements. There were no advertisements on international television, VHS, and DVD. The "Producer Says" part was taken out when "The Magic School Bus" had advertisements. This way, there was enough time for advertisements. Sometimes the episode faded to black at the start of the advertisements. When there are no advertisements, the episode faded to black and then faded back in.

Peter Lurye wrote the song played at the beginning of the show. It was called "Ride on the Magic School Bus". Famous rock' n 'roll singer Little Richard sang it.

Brian Muehl and Jocelyn Stevenson helped write the show. They also worked on "Fraggle Rock".

In the United States, "The Magic School Bus" originally aired on PBS as a part of its children's block, PBS Kids, through South Carolina's SCETV network. It was the first fully animated series to be aired on PBS. The final episode aired on December 6, 1997. The series then aired reruns on PBS until October 1998. Fox Kids Network, in a hasty effort to fill educational television mandates for its stations, aired reruns on its weekday block from September 1998 to September 2002. Beginning on September 27, 2010, "The Magic School Bus" started a daily run on child-oriented network Qubo in the US, and on Saturday mornings on NBC. The Fox Kids and Qubo airings both used a shortened version of the opening. "The Magic School Bus" was also seen on TLC from February 15, 2003 until 2008. It also aired on the Ready Set Learn block on Discovery Kids from 2004 to 2009.

The series was widely known in Canada for showing reruns on CBC as part of its children's block, now known as Kids' CBC, from 1999 to 2004. In 2005, Nelvana sold the series to Latin America's Cartoon Network. 

In Canada, it ran on Teletoon from 1998 until 2000, and has run on TVO Kids from 1998 until the present time. It was presented internationally by Discovery Kids from 2004 to 2009, and in the UK, Latin America, Australia, Spain, and India by Nickelodeon from 1995 to 2003. It was also shown in the UK by Pop from 2003 to 2007. It aired for some time on Channel 4 from 1996 to 2000. It also aired on CITV from 1995 to 2002.

The series was originally released on VHS by KidVision between 1995 and 2003 and on DVD by Warner Home Video between 2002 and 2013. Only the VHSs and DVDs contain the funding credits. In the home video releases, all the episodes are uncut with the "Producer Says" segments intact. 

On July 31, 2012, New Video Group released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time.

On August 15, 2013, Scholastic announced the entire series would be available on Netflix.

Jason Fry, in a column for the online edition of "The Wall Street Journal", expressed an overall appreciation for the show, but wrote that the episode "The Magic School Bus Gets Programmed" should have been about the dangers of Internet searches and network concepts arising at the time, rather than an old-fashioned technology-run-amok story about the respective roles of programmer and machine (although he conceded that the episode was ten years old).

Tomlin won a Daytime Emmy for her role as Ms. Frizzle.

Various computer and video games associated with the series were released from 1994 to 2001, and were typically amalgamations of storylines from both the original book series and the television show. The games were published by Microsoft Home for the Educational purpose.

A video game titled "The Magic School Bus: Oceans" was released for Nintendo DS on October 25, 2011, ten years after the release of the last game. The video game, similar to the computer game before it, was likely based on the book, "The Magic School Bus On the Ocean Floor" and the TV episode, "The Magic School Bus Gets Eaten". This is the only game to have been released for the Nintendo platform.

On June 10, 2014, a new series was announced by Netflix and Scholastic Media titled "The Magic School Bus 360°". The new iteration of the franchise features a modernized Ms. Frizzle and high-tech bus that stresses modern inventions such as robotics, wearables and camera technology. The producers hoped to captivate children's imaginations and motivate their interest in the sciences. 9 Story Media Group would produce the series. Producer Stuart Stone, who voiced Ralphie in the original series, stated that "The Magic School Bus 360°" will feature some of the original voice actors in different roles. The show's voice cast is based in Los Angeles and Toronto with Susan Blu as the Los Angeles voice director and Alyson Court as the Toronto voice director.

In February 2017, Netflix announced that Kate McKinnon was cast in the role of Fiona Felicity Frizzle, the younger sister of Ms. Frizzle, now Professor Frizzle, again played by Lily Tomlin. By this point the title of the series had been changed to "The Magic School Bus Rides Again". Lin-Manuel Miranda of "Hamilton" performs the theme song. The series began on Netflix on September 29, 2017.

He won his first Olympic gold and third Olympic medal overall during the team event, defeating the Olympic Athletes from Russia. He skated both segments, ranking third in the short and first in the free skate. This earned 18 team points for Canada, six more than the Russian skater Mikhail Kolyada.

Grasslands National Park

Grasslands National Park () is a national park in Canada. It is near the village of Val Marie, Saskatchewan. It is the second national park of Canada that was created in Saskatchewan. The park is next to the border between Canada and the United States. It is next to the state of Montana. More than 18 000 people visit the park every year.

The park was created in 1981. Before this, the only national park in Saskatchewan was Prince Albert National Park. The park has some of Canada's last prairie grasslands that humans have not affected. The park's climate also lets some rare and endangered plants and animals live there. Grasslands National Park also have Canada's last black-tailed prairie dog groups. The park is also a dark-sky preserve. Grasslands National Park is the darkest dark-sky preserve in Canada. It is also one of the darkest in the world.

Grasslands National Park also has a lot of fossils. It has many fossils that can't be found in other parts of Canada. Some of the fossils come from the Miocene Era.

Before the 1950s, the First Nations people of Canada lived in the park. They hunted animals in the park.

Many people wanted to protect the grasslands in the area. They also wanted to protect the plants and animals that lived in the area. In the 1950s and 1960s, many people wanted a large area of grasslands protected. A study in 1965 showed that this area of Saskatchewan would be the best place to start a park. Both the governments of Alberta and Saskatchewan created a group to listen to the public's opinion in 1975. The group said that the public wanted the park to be created.

In 1981, the governments of Saskatchewan and Canada signed an agreement. This would make sure that a park would be created. After the agreement was signed, Parks Canada bought two ranches. These ranches were near the Frenchman River and were . In 1988, many organisations came together to add to the 1981 agreement. This would make it so that Grasslands National Park would be created. The plan for the park would be that it would be around . Parks Canada continued to buy more land for the park from ranchers.

The park officially became a national park on 19 February 2001. This was because of the Canada National Parks Act. In 2006, some of the plains bison that lived in Elk Island National Park in Alberta were moved to Grasslands National Park. This was important because many of the bison in Canada were killed in the 1800s. It was the first time that plains bison were on the shortgrass prairies of Canada since the 1890s. 71 bison were first moved to the park. Nine years later, in 2015, there were 310 bison. There are now plains bison at other national parks in Canada.

The park became a dark-sky preserve in 2009. This was during the International Year of Astronomy. The park was chosen by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. It became Saskatchewan's second dark-sky preserve. In 2009, Parks Canada also added black-footed ferrets back to the park. They added 34 ferrets. People thought that the black-footed ferret was extinct. This is because the last time they were seen was in 1937 in Saskatchewan. Scientists from the United States began working on bringing them back to the wild. When Parks Canada added black-footed ferrets back to Grasslands National Park, there were already ferrets that were being added to places in the United States and Mexico. The scientists were working to bring back the black-footed ferret for many years. The people working at Parks Canada were working on bringing them back for many years.

The park is divided into two parts. The west park of the park (called the West Block) is in Division No. 4, Saskatchewan. The West Block has the Frenchman River valley. They also have a herd of 300 plains bison and many prairie dog colonies. The Frenchman Valley Campground lets visitors use camping sites and teepees. Backcountry camping is also allowed in the West Block. The east part of the park (called the East Block) is in Division No. 3, Saskatchewan. Visitors to the East Block can see views of the badlands and see the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary in the rock.

Louie Louie

"Louie Louie" is a rhythm and blues song written by Richard Berry in 1955 and best known for the 1963 hit version by The Kingsmen. It is a rock standard. "Louie Louie" tells, in simple verse–chorus form, the first-person story of a Jamaican sailor returning to the island to see his lady love.

The Kingsmen's cover recording was the subject of an FBI investigation about the supposed but nonexistent obscenity of the lyrics, an investigation that ended without prosecution. Ironically, the recording notably includes the drummer yelling "Fuck!" after dropping his drumstick at the 0:54 mark.

While the Kingsmen's version did not top the "Billboard" chart, it did reach #1 on "Cashbox" for two weeks, and it was the last #1 before Beatlemania hit the United States with "I Want to Hold Your Hand". The Kingsmen's version of "Louie Louie" is considered the epitome of garage rock and is often considered one of the greatest rock songs of all time.

Small seal script

Small seal script, or xiaozhuang characters, was the first set of Chinese characters that were made the standard all across China. Previously, each of the Warring States had their own Chinese characters. People from one state did not understand the characters from another. When the Qin dynasty (221 BC to 206 BC) conquered the other states, Emperor Qin Shi Huang forced all Imperial China to use Qin characters and Qin units of measurement. This allowed people all across China to communicate with each other without confusion.

Since the strokes used to write small seal script characters were very long, curvy, and difficult to write quickly, officials of the Han dynasty replaced small seal script with traditional characters, which are still used today in China. However, since small seal characters look very artistic, they can still be seen in Chinese seals and calligraphy today.

Imperial China

Imperial China is a period of Chinese history. It lasted over 2,000 years. It began with Qin Shi Huang's uniting of China under the Qin dynasty in 221 BC. It ended with the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911. Throughout this period, many features of Chinese civilization spread throughout all of China. These included Confucianism, standardized testing, standardized weights and counting systems, trade routes, and Chinese characters. China became known worldwide for all these features. 

Throughout this period, China had been ruled by many different dynasties, or ruling family lines. They included the Qin, Han, Sui, Tang, Song, Yuan/Mongol, Ming, and Qing/Manchu dynasties. There were also several periods where China had been ruled by several different kingdoms.

Throughout most of Imperial China, China had been ruled by emperors and empresses who were Han Chinese. However, there were some dynasties where the ruling class was made of Chinese minority groups, such as the Yuan and Qing dynasties. They were ruled by the Mongols and Manchus in that same order.

Standardized test

A standardized test is a test that is done and scored in a consistent, or "standard", manner. Standardized tests are designed so that everything about them are standard. They are administered and scored in a predetermined, standard manner.

Often they are used as a test to join an institution or gain a license of some sort. The grading system is the same no matter where they are taken. They can be used for university entry, like the SAT and ACT in the United States or the Gaokao in the People's Republic of China (PRC). They can be used a requirement to get a job, like the LSAT for lawyers.

In the United States the term is often used for the multiple-choice questions used in the educational system. They are thought by some to be a poor way to measure educational progress. They are, however, convenient and cheap. Marking does not require expertise in the subject-matter.

Many psychological tests are designed to be standardized. They are designed to be "an objective and standardized measure of a sample of behavior".

The first known standardized test was in Imperial China, when Empress Wu allowed anyone who passed the test to be a government official based on their merit rather than birthright, meaning that people work to become leaders rather than being born into leadership. However, we do not know the details of this system.

La Brabançonne

La Brabançonne (; , ; "The Brabantian") is the national anthem of Belgium. It was written by Frenchman Alexandre Dechet. It currently has official lyrics in Belgium's three official languages- French, Dutch, and German. Before the main song, "Vive la Belgique" is said in French.

Heartbound (video game)

Heartbound is a planned role-playing game for Microsoft Windows, Linux and OS X, developed by an American Indie game developer, Pirate Software.

The game is about a young man called Lore, who struggles with his thoughts, such as depression and anxiety, while trying to find his dog, Baron, who has gone missing.

The game is influenced by the player's actions while playing the game. Performing negative actions, such as feeding Baron rubbish in the beginning of the game, causes Lore to become more evil and negative. Performing positive actions, such as feeding Baron dog food, causes Lore to become more positive himself.

An Alpha version of the game has been released - the full version is planned for release in December 2018.

Heartbound is similar to another role-playing game, Undertale, in that interactions with the environment causes the game's story to change. According to Pirate Game's website:

""Every time you interact with an object, talk to an NPC, forget to turn off a light-switch, take out the trash, or disregard a sparkly bush the game remembers this and will change subtly for all further interactions. The greatest part about this design is that it already works and is in the current builds of the game. Both minor and major differences are going to pop up throughout the game and give the community something to share with one another. Everything you do matters no matter what kind of player you are or choose to be."" 

Heartbound has a different combat system to most other role-playing games. Instead of attacking enemies based on a statistics system, the player has to complete minigames, which can either deal damage or cause the player to lose health, depending on the exact minigame. Equipment can also be found around the worlds Lore explores, which will increase attack strength or maximum health. Battles are not random - they are supposed to occur at specific points in the game, although some are avoidable if the player goes down certain gameplay routes.

Plot hole

In fiction, a plot hole is a part of a story that goes against something that has already been stated. These may include events that should not happen according for in-universe reasons, events that seem unlikely or events that contradict earlier events in the narrative.

The term can also be used to describe a situation that has not been resolved by the end of the plot, even though there will be no continuing story.


Psychological test

Psychological testing of the modern type started about 150 years ago. Francis Galton (1822–1911) invented the first tests. The American psychologist James Cattell (1860–1944) studied with Galton and then, in 1890, published a classic paper "Mental Tests and Measurements".

The definition of a psychological test is "an objective and standardized measure of a sample of behavior". The kind of tests which were developed included:

Psychologists who give these tests have training and qualifications which tell the employer that they are certified to give the tests and assess (understand) the results.

Hurricane Michael

Hurricane Michael was an Atlantic tropical cyclone. The storm threatened Cuba, northwestern Florida, Georgia and southern Alabama. It was the 13 named storm, seventh hurricane, and the second major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the first Category 5 hurricane and the strongest on record to impact the Florida Panhandle, and was the fourth-strongest landfalling hurricane in the United States in terms of wind speed. As Michael became a Category 5 hurricane, the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season became a third consecutive season to feature at least one Category 5 hurricane since Matthew in 2016 and Irma in 2017; this also makes Michael the third straight "M" name to feature as a Category 5 hurricane since Matthew in 2016 and Maria in 2017 as well.

The storm passed near western Cuba on October 7-8.

The storm led to six deaths in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador.

Michael became a major hurricane on Tuesday, October 9, 2018.

The storm struck near Mexico Beach, Florida in the Florida Panhandle as a borderline Category 5 hurricane, which makes it the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in the United States as a Category 5 hurricane since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. It had a wind speed of 160 mph and a central pressure of 919 millibars. It was originally designated as a high-end Category 4 hurricane with wind speed of 155 mph, but from post-analysis, it was indeed a Category 5 hurricane as originally thought. It was said to be the strongest hurricane to hit Florida since Andrew in 1992 in terms of pressure which it had a central pressure of 922 millibars. It was also the strongest hurricane to hit the United States in terms of pressure since Hurricane Camille in 1969, which had a pressure of 900 millibars.

On March 20, 2019, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name "Michael" due to extreme and very expensive damage it caused along its track, particularly in the Florida Panhandle and southwest Georgia, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane. It will be replaced with "Milton" for the 2024 season.

Far Eastern Air Transport Flight 103

Far East Air Transport Flight 103, a Boeing 737-200, registration B-2603, departed Taipei Songshan Airport for Kaohsiung on 22 August 1981. The aircraft suffered an explosive decompression fourteen minutes after takeoff and disintegrated.

The aircraft had previously lost cabin pressure on 5 August; and earlier on the day of the crash it had departed Songshan Airport but the crew aborted the flight ten minutes later for the same reason. After repairs were made the aircraft departed Songshan Airport again and broke up shortly afterward.

Although there was early speculation that the crash was caused by a bomb, an investigation by the Republic of China Civil Aeronautics Board concluded that severe corrosion led to a pressure hull rupture. The severe corrosion was due to the many pressurization flight cycles the aircraft had experienced, and that cracks produced were probably undetected.

The wreckage was scattered across an area of located some south of Taipei. All 110 people onboard (110 passengers and crew, including eighteen Japanese citizens (among them Kuniko Mukōda) and two Americans) died. The accident was Taiwan's worst air disaster at the time, but is now the second-worst, behind China Airlines Flight 676.

Singular value decomposition

In linear algebra, the singular-value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix. It is the generalization of the eigendecomposition of a positive semidefinite normal matrix (for example, a symmetric matrix with positive eigenvalues) to any matrix via an extension of the polar decomposition. It has many useful applications in signal processing and statistics.

Formally, the singular value decomposition of an formula_1 complex matrix formula_2 is a factorization of the form formula_3, where formula_4 is an formula_5 complex unitary matrix, formula_6 is an formula_1 rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, and formula_8 is an formula_9 complex unitary matrix. The diagonal entries formula_10 of formula_6 are known as the singular values of formula_2. The columns of formula_4 and the columns of formula_8 are called the left-singular vectors and right-singular vectors of formula_2, respectively.

The singular-value decomposition can be computed using the following observations:

Pre-algebra is mainly about equations and evaluating what certain variables are. An example is "3y+x-3=y-x+10 say we need to solve for x. we would need to subtract 3y from both sides of the equal sign. So it becomes x-3=10-2y-x next we need to add 3. So x=13-2y-x, and then add x to each side. 2x=13-2y divide each side by 2 so x=-y+13/2."

Nomogram

A nomogram, alignment chart or abaque is a graph for calculation. It is a two-dimensional diagram which gives a computation of a mathematical function. 

The field of nomography was invented in 1884 by the French engineer Philbert Maurice d’Ocagne (18621938). It was used for many years to provide engineers with fast graphical calculations of complicated formulas. Nomograms use a parallel coordinate system invented by d'Ocagne rather than standard Cartesian coordinates.

A nomogram consists of a set of n scales, one for each variable in an equation. Knowing the values of n-1 variables, the value of the unknown variable can be found, or by fixing the values of some variables, the relationship between the unfixed ones can be studied. 

The result is got by laying a straightedge across the known values on the scales and reading the unknown value from where it crosses the scale for that variable. The virtual or drawn line created by the straightedge is called an "index line" or "isopleth".

Nomograms were widely used for about 75 years. They allowed quick and accurate computations before the age of pocket calculators. Results from a nomogram are got quickly and reliably by drawing one or more lines. The user does not have to know how to solve algebraic equations, look up data in tables, use a slide rule, or substitute numbers into equations to obtain results. The user does not even need to know the underlying equation the nomogram represents. 

Nomograms have domain knowledge into their design. For example, to create larger nomograms for greater accuracy the nomographer usually includes only scale ranges that are reasonable and of interest to the problem. Many nomograms include other useful markings such as reference labels and colored regions. All of these provide useful guideposts to the user. 

Like a slide rule, a nomogram is a graphical analog computation device. Like the slide rule, its accuracy is limited by the precision with which physical markings can be drawn, reproduced, viewed, and aligned.A slide rule is a general-purpose calculator, but a nomogram is designed to perform a specific calculation. Nomograms can still be used to check an answer from another, more exact but possibly error-prone calculation.

Dinosaur size

Dinosaur size has long been of interest to the scientific and the public. Dinosaurs show some of the most extreme variations in size of any land animal group, ranging from the tiny hummingbirds, which can weigh as little as three grams, to the extinct titanosaurs, which could weigh as much as .

We will never be certain of the largest and smallest dinosaurs to have existed. This is because only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few specimens recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork. Weight estimates for dinosaurs are much more variable than length estimates, because estimating length for extinct animals is much more easily done from a skeleton than estimating weight. Estimating weight is most easily done with the laser scan skeleton technique that puts a "virtual" skin over it, but even this is only an estimate.

Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the Triassic, early Jurassic, late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Predatory theropod dinosaurs, which occupied most terrestrial carnivore niches during the Mesozoic, most often fall into the 100- to 1,000-kilogram (220 to 2,200 lb) category when sorted by estimated weight into categories based on order of magnitude. In comparison, recent predatory carnivore mammals peak in the 10- to 100-kilogram (22 to 220 lb) category. The mode of Mesozoic dinosaur body masses is between one and ten metric tonnes. This contrasts sharply with the size of Cenozoic mammals, estimated by the National Museum of Natural History as about .

Habeas Corpus Suspension Act (1863)

Lincoln's suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus.

Since the end of the Civil War, historians have constantly reviewed Abraham Lincoln's suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. Habeas corpus is stated in Article 1, Section 9 of the constitution as follows: "the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion and invasion the public safety may require it...", and is sometimes referred to in short as "the suspension clause." 

The writ in essence requires that when arrested, a person has the right to be brought before a court or governmental judge to determine that there is a means to secure a person's release unless there are lawful grounds presented by the arresting authorities to justify detention of the accused.

Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War has been studied by historians from the time of the civil war and has not ceased until today with the subject of constitutional validity of the suspension. More specifically, the question of whether the power of suspension rests with the President or with Congress.

Lynching in the United States

Lynching is a form of murder. It is normally by hanging. Lynching is often by a group of people as a form of punishment. In the United States, lynchings happened more often after the American Civil War in the early-to-mid 1860s.

Although the number of lynchings went down in the 1920s, they have continued into the 21st century.

Most, but not all, lynchings were of African American men in the South. Ninety-two women were lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1927. The lynchings of black people by white people happened in the Midwest and border states. There were also lynchings of Native Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans in the West. White people were also lynched but these lynchings were less common. 

According to the Tuskegee Institute, 4,743 people were lynched between 1882 and 1968 in the United States. This includes 3,446 African Americans and 1,297 whites. More than 73 percent of lynchings after the Civil War happened in the Southern states. According to the Equal Justice Initiative, 4,084 African-Americans were lynched between 1877 and 1950 in the South. Whites lynched blacks to defend white supremacy. Blacks were lynched for violating social norms, including segregation (the separation of whites and blacks), and the lower status of blacks. White acted together to lynch an individual black person. In the Deep South, lynching was also used to scare blacks away from voting.

After the Civil War, nearly four million slaves in the South were made free. In some states and many counties, freed blacks made up over half the people who lived there. The first Ku Klux Klan was founded in 1866 by Confederate veterans in Tennessee. Ku Klux Klan groups were then founded by veterans throughout the South. They wanted to keep African Americans in fear, as they were before the war. This was when lynchings became common. In the 1890s, African American journalist and anti-lynching fighter Ida B. Wells was one of the first people to study lynching cases. She found that black lynching victims were accused of rape or attempted rape about one-third of the time. The most common accusation was murder or attempted murder. Other accusations were verbal and physical aggression, competitive businesses and independent thinking. In 1940, sociologist Arthur F. Raper investigated one hundred lynchings after 1929. He said that about one-third of the victims were falsely accused.

The stereotype of lynching is hanging. Hangings are what crowds of people saw. Hanging is also easy to photograph. There are other forms of lynching. They include being shot repeatedly, being burned, dragged behind cars and being forced to jump from a bridge.

In the late-1800s to early-1900s South, photographs were taken at lynchings. These were used in postcards and newspapers. These images usually showed an African-American lynching victim and all or part of the crowd that attended. Women and children often watched lynchings. The people who killed the victim were not identified. At one lynching, nearly 15,000 people were in the crowd. Often lynchings were advertised in newspapers before the event so photographers could be there. After the lynching, photographers would sell their pictures as-is or as postcards. They could cost as much as fifty cents each, or $9, as of 2016.

Anabolic steroid

Anabolic steroids (anabolic-androgenic steroids) are steroidal androgenics. They include natural androgens such as testosterone and synthetic androgens. The synthetic androgens have similar chemical structure and similar effects to testosterone.

The steroids increase protein within cells, mainly skeletal muscles. They cause the development and maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics. They stimulate the growth of hair on the face and body.

The word anabolic, in reference to anabolism, comes from the Greek word "anabole". That means: "That, which is thrown up, mound". 

Androgens (or AAS) were synthesized in the 1930s. They are now used in medicine to bring on muscle growth and appetite. They also cause male puberty. AAS can also be used to treat chronic wasting conditions such as AIDS and cancer.

Long term use of androgens can lead to or cause harmful health effects. These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels, acne, high blood pressure and liver damage.

Use of androgens in sports, racing and bodybuilding as performance enhancing drugs is under controversy because of their adverse effects. There is also the chance to gain unfair advantage in physical competitions. The use of androgens in sports is called doping. Their use is banned by most major sporting bodies.

Password (game show)

Password is a television game show. It was hosted by Allen Ludden from October 2, 1961 to September 15, 1967 during daytime and was on primetime from January 2, 1962 to May 22, 1967 on CBS. A revival was made in 1971 and aired on ABC. The show spawned two revivals in 1979 and 1984 respectively, "Password Plus" and "Super Password".

Two celebrities play with two civilians in two teams of two people each – a celebrity and a civilian. A "password" shown on the screen is given to the celebrities/civilians and they have to give the partners one-word clues to get it correctly. For example, if the password was "word", someone would give the clue "pass" and the civilian/celebrity would try to guess the password (e.g. "word"). If the password is guessed in one guess, they get 10 points. Each wrong guess removes a point (e.g. 1 wrong guess makes it 9, 2 wrong guesses makes it 8, etc.). Two word clues (e.g. "light sleeper") or "sounds" were not allowed, other wise a buzzer would sound and Allen Ludden would say "When you hear this sound it means your clue has not been accepted by our word authority (name of word authority)". The first person to get 25 points wins $250 and goes to the "Lightning Round" where they are given 60 seconds to guess 5 words worth $50. Each one correct will cost that amount and a second game is played where a new set of civilians comes in (Prior to November 1962, the civilians switched seats instead). At the end of the show, Allen Ludden would give a "password of the day" (e.g. "parties") and would make a sentence about the password (""Password" is a great game to play at "parties"") before signing off.

The show was announced by Jack Clark and announced all the "passwords" on the screen. Sometimes Allen Ludden would take a vacation and Jack Clark would fill in for him and Bob Kennedy would be the announcer on those occasions.

The word authority for most of the CBS run was Dr. Reason A. Goodwin. He wrote the "World Book Encyclopedia Dictionary" which was released in 1963, two years after "Password" began.

In 1966 the show switched from black and white to color. On the first color show (September 12, 1966) Allen Ludden said "We're in color! Look at us-we're in color." This episode, along with many others are available on YouTube.

From 1961 to 1963, the theme song was called "Holiday Jaunt". From 1963 to 1967 the theme was called "You Know The Password". In 1971 a song by Score Productions was used. In 1974 the theme song was changed to "Bicentennial Funk." "Password Plus" and "Super Password" used different themes for both versions.

In 1971, the show returned on ABC. In 1974, the show changed its name to "Password All-Stars". The show was cancelled in 1975.

In 1979, a revival called "Password Plus" was made. After Allen Ludden died in 1981, Tom Kennedy took over as host. "Password Plus" was cancelled in March 1982.

In 1984, a new version called "Super Password" was made with Bert Convy as host. The show was cancelled in 1989.

Every nighttime episode was recorded on videotape and has aired on GSN and Buzzr. All daytime episodes before September 12, 1966 (except one from January 14, 1966) is gone forever. Color daytime episodes from September 1966 to 1967 last aired on GSN in 2009 and are currently airing on Buzzr.

The 1971 version is almost gone except for a few episodes. The original tapes were reused for the 1976 version of "Family Feud". These have aired on GSN in the past.

"Password Plus" and "Super Password" exists in their entirety and both have aired on GSN and Buzzr.

The game is parodied in the "Family Guy" season 2 episode "Wasted Talent".

In 2013, a short movie called "Subconscious Password" was made where a man forgets the name of someone he met at a party and must remember from clues given by celebrities a la "Password".

The Srebrenica massacre, also known as the Srebrenica genocide (), was the July 1995 genocide of 8,373 Bosniaks, mainly military-aged men and boys in and around the town of Srebrenica during the Bosnian War by the Army of Republika Srpska (the Serb Republic of Bosnia) instructed by Ratko Mladić. The Genocide is like the Armenian genocide by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1917 and the Nazi Genocide known as the Holocaust from 1941 to 1945 during World War 2 in Nazi Germany (planned by the notorious Nazi SS Officer Reinhard Heydrich) . The Bosnian genocide from 1992 to 1995 during the Yugoslav Wars when the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia started to collapse in 1992 after 47 year's of Communism since 1945 and since the death of Josip Broz Tito in 1980 just 35 year's after Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes or the Kingdom of Yugoslavia became a Communist State .

In 2005, Kofi Annan, then Secretary-General of the United Nations, described the genocide as the worst crime against humanity in Europe since the Second World War.

In July 2015, Russia disliked a UN request that would have declare the Srebrenica massacre as a genocide. The Serbian Prime Minister at that time, Tomislav Nikolić, later thanked Russia for disliking said request, as it would paint Serbia up as a country of genocide. No further request by the UN has been attempted to declare it as a genocide since.

Jane Barnell

Jane Barnell (previously O'Boyle) (January 3, 1871– Unknown) was an American bearded lady who worked in circus sideshows, dime museums and carnivals. A trapeze artist and commercial photographer, who used various stage names including Madame Olga, Lady Olga and Lady Olga Roderick. In her only film role in Tod Browning's cult classic "Freaks", using her sideshow stage name Olga Roderick, she was billed as the "Bearded Lady".

Jane Barnell was born in Wilmington, North Carolina, to George Barnell, a Russian Jewish itinerant wagon maker, and his wife, a woman of Irish and Catawban ancestry. When she applied for her social security card in May 1939, she gave her parents as George Barnell and Nancy Shaw. Her mother's name is not mentioned in the interviews she gave. She was their second child, and she had three sisters and two brothers. She was named after her maternal grandmother. Her mother was from York County, South Carolina. By two years of age, she was capable of growing a beard. Her mother took her to hoodoo doctors and other folk healers to remove her condition.

In 1875, Barnell's mother sold the 4-year-old Jane to the Great Orient Family Circus and Menagerie while her father was away on business in Baltimore. The circus consisted of the Muslim woman who worked as manager, two of her daughters who danced, and three sons who juggled and were tight rope walkers. Jane toured with the circus for several months around the South before the circus went to New Orleans, left for Europe, and took her with them. In Europe the circus toured with a German circus. She fell ill with typhoid fever in Berlin. She was placed in a charity hospital and later in an orphanage. She was later found by her father by the time she was five. He had either tracked the circus from the Carolinas to Germany, or the woman who ran the circus had the Berlin police contact the sheriff of Wilmington.

After that incident, Barnell was placed in the care of her Catawban grandmother who lived in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. She began to shave in order to conceal her condition. Her grandmother told her stories about Florence Nightingale, which inspired her to work as a student nurse in the old city hospital at Wilmington when she turned 17. She worked there for about a year until an unpleasant incident occurred that made her believe she would never have a normal life. She returned to her grandmother's farm. In spring 1892 she met a circus performer named Professor William Heckler who talked her into stopping shaving and got her employment with John Robinson’s Circus. She tried several stage names before eventually settling on Lady Olga Roderick. At that time her beard was 13 inches long. She went back to North Carolina every winter until her grandmother died in 1899. She worked with the Robinson circus for fourteen years.

At some point during her life, Barnell worked as a trapeze artist before having a railroad accident that ended her career. She then became a commercial photographer.

Barnell toured for a time with a number of circuses, including the Ringling Brothers circus, and later joined Hubert's Museum in Times Square, New York City. She appeared in a Tod Browning's 'Freaks' (1932) which, according to the documentary on the "Freaks" DVD ("Freaks: The Sideshow Cinema", 2004), left her unhappy with the overall portrayal of the sideshow performers in the film.

In April 1935, she was working at the Ringling Brothers' sideshow at Madison Square Garden.

In 1940, she was interviewed by Joseph Mitchell for an article for "The New Yorker". His interview is one of the few sources that exists about her life.

The exact date and place of her death is unknown. Her date and place of death has been erroneously reported online as October 26, 1951. That date comes from some researchers confusing her death with that of a Susan Jane Barnell. When approached by Diane Arbus about information regarding her death, Joseph Mitchell verified her passing.

Barnell was married four times. Her first marriage was to a German musician who played in the band for John Robinson's Circus. She had two children with him. Her husband and their two children died within several years. Her second husband was a balloonist who was killed months after their marriage. Her third marriage was to an alcoholic whom she divorced. Her last marriage, in 1931, was to her manager Thomas O'Boyle, an orphan ex-circus clown and a sideshow talker for Hubert's Dime Museum. She had little contact with her family after she became a performer. She believed they thought she was a disgrace. By 1940, she claimed to have not seen her siblings in 22 years and believed them to be dead. One of her sisters worked as a nurse helping blind Chinese children.

In April 1935, she gave a slightly different account of her personal life when interviewed by Ruth McKenney. She claimed that she had been married thrice; the first time when she was fourteen; the second time when she was nineteen; and then to her husband of four years Thomas O'Boyle.

Deep learning

Deep learning (also called deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is a kind of machine learning, which is mostly used with certain kinds of neural networks. As with other kinds of machine-learning, learning sessions can be unsupervised, semi-supervised, or supervised. In many cases, structures are organised so that there is at least one intermediate layer (or hidden layer), between the input layer and the output layer.

Certain tasks, such as recognizing and understanding speech, images or handwriting, is easy to do for humans. However, for a computer, these tasks are very difficult to do. In a multi-layer neural network (having more than two layers), the information processed will become more abstract with each added layer.

Deep learning models are inspired by information processing and communication patterns in biological nervous systems; they are different from the structural and functional properties of biological brains (especially the human brain) in many ways, which make them incompatible with neuroscience evidences.

The reason of the change was that the team was followed almost exclusively by Italian colonists and their descendants, so the management tried to get followers from the native Somalis erasing the Italian word "calcio" (that means 'football' in Italian).

The main rival of the AS Mogadiscio (the team of the Italians of the capital) was in the 1950s the Lavori Publici FC (or "Genio Oficina"), that was the team of the Italian of all Somalia and that had many native Somalis as fans.

Finally, in the 1957-58 Championship, the AS Mogadiscio was named "Champion of Somalia", with the following results:

In the 1959-1960 Championship the AS Mogadishu disputed its last contest, being third.

In 1961 the team was declared "closed", mainly for economic reasons since it almost did not have followers (because of the almost total disappearance of the Italians of Mogadishu & Somalia, who moved away -mainly to Italy)).

Marbury v. Madison

Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803), was a United States Supreme Court court case. It was between William Marbury and James Madison.

In the 1800 United States Presidential election, Thomas Jefferson won over John Adams. Days before Adams had to leave office, he wanted to give a number of people jobs (so that Jefferson could not give these jobs away). The United States Senate approved of his picks (nominations) and John Marshall, who was then Adams' Secretary of State and was to be the Chief Justice of the United States, had a number of these notices sent out. One that did not make it before midnight was to William Marbury.

When Jefferson took office, he ordered "his" Secretary of State, James Madison, to cancel the ones that had not been delivered. So then Marbury sued Madison because Marbury wanted his job as Justice of the Peace in the District of Columbia.

John Marshall ruled on this case as the Chief Justice. He first answered that Marbury had a right to his job because it had been signed and approved. The actual delivery was a custom, not a requirement. He then ruled that a writ of mandamus (a type of court order) was the correct way for Marbury to rule. Finally, he noted that the Judiciary Act of 1789 allowed the Supreme Court to make this kind of ruling.

The next question was "who" could decide this issue. Marshall ruled that the Supreme Court could decide it because the Judiciary Act of 1789 said that they could. However, Marshall said that a section of the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional. That section allowed the Supreme Court to make a writ but the "United States Constitution" did not. Therefore, that section was unconstitutional and the Supreme Court could not make a writ for Marbury.

Marshall looking over the Constitution and the statute is judicial review, a statement that the Supreme Court had an independent power to determine whether something was constitutional or not.

Exonym and endonym

An exonym is a name of a person, a people group, language, or place used by people of other places and languages. An endonym is a name that people of a certain place and language call themselves. For example, the endonym of Germany is "Deutschland", because that is what Germans call their country, and Germans call themselves and their language "Deutsch". On the other hand, Germany and German are its exonym because English speakers, who are not German, use those names to describe it.

This is actually very common across languages for several reasons. One reason is because the sounds for an endonym may not exist in certain languages. It would be difficult for speakers of other languages to say them, so speakers of other languages make an exonym. For example, words in Japanese cannot end in any consonant that is not an "n" sound, and for that reason, "Deutsch" is "Doitsu" in Japanese. Japanese also adds Japanese morphemes so that there is no confusion between the country, the people, and the language. The German people are "Doitsujin", in which "-jin" means people, and the name of the German language is "Doitsugo", in which "-go" means language. While the country, people, and language of Laos can all be called "Lao" in English, they are called "Raosu", "Rasoujin", and "Raosugo" in Japanese in that same order.

Another reason why a country might call another country a different name is because people from a certain country might have different ideas about those people or associate them with certain things. For example, even though Greeks call their country "Hellas", their country is known around the world as Greece because the Roman Empire named the region after "Magna" "Graecia", which were coastal areas in southern Italy that were colonized by Greeks in the early days of Rome. Germany has a very large number of exonyms, being called "Allemagne" in French, "Niemcy" in Polish, and "Saksa" in Finnish. This is because Germany has interacted with many other European countries and the Germans were a collection of tribes speaking similar languages until they unified into a country in the late 19th century. Even though the Dutch call themselves "Nederlanders" in their own language, English speakers call them Dutch (a cognate of the German word "Deutsch") because the words German and Dutch used to be interchangeable until Germany unified in the 1800s. From then on, German was used to describe people from Germany, while Dutch was used to describe people from the Netherlands.

Even though in Mandarin Chinese China is called "Zhōngguó", meaning the "Middle Kingdom" or the "Central States", most other countries calls it China. It is believed that the word China cam from the word "Qín", in which the Qin dynasty unified China. However, there are a few exceptions. In Japanese, it is called "Chūgoku", which has the same meaning as the Chinese name, except it uses the Japanese pronunciation for the Chinese characters for the name 中國 / 中国. In Korean, it is called "Jungguk" for the same reason. In Russian, China is called "Kitay".

A third reason why a country might call another place a different name is because a language can borrow a name from another language. Even though Japan is called "Nippon" or "Nihon" in Japanese, the word passed on to Europe through many different languages, all of which were very different from Japanese. Marco Polo heard about Kublai Khan sending soldiers to Cipangu, which in Chinese characters is 日本, which means "Sun's Origin". When the Portuguese arrived in Japan in the mid-16th century, who were the first Europeans to directly trade with Japan, they called the country "Japão" based on an old Malay word, which was borrowed from a southern Chinese dialect. Thus, most other countries call the country Japan. A few exceptions are Chinese, which call it "Rìběn" based on the Mandarin pronunciation of the Chinese characters, and Korean, which call it "Ilbon" based on the Korean pronunciation of the Chinese characters. Also, while many countries call European cities by their endonym, including "Roma", "Praha", "Köln", and "Napoli", the English names of many European cities are noticeably different, which are called Rome, Prague, Cologne, and Naples in the same order. These names were borrowed from French. Since French was the official language of England from the Norman invasion to King Henry V, many of the cities names came into English through French.

Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel

Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (31 October 1875 — 15 December 1950) was a lawyer and influential political leader in the Indian independence movement. After independence, he played an important role in the integration of over 500 princely states into the Indian Union. He was deeply influenced by Gandhi’s ideology and principles, having worked very closely with the leader. He was the first Home Minister of Independent India and his uncompromising efforts towards consolidation of the country earned him the title "Iron Man of India".

Vallabhai Patel was born on October 31, 1875 in Nadiad village of modern day Gujarat to Jhaverbai and Ladbai. He belongs to rich class agriculturist Patidar (leva patidar patel) community and Vallabhbhai’s father had served in the army of the Queen of Jhansi, and his mother was a very spiritual woman.

Starting his academic career in a Gujarati medium school, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel later shifted to an English medium school. In 1897, Vallabhbhai passed his high school and started preparing for law examination. He went to pursue a degree in law and travelled to England in 1910. He completed his law degree in 1913 from Inns of Court and came back to India to start his law practice in Godhra, Gujarat. For his legal proficiency, Vallabhbhai was offered many lucrative posts by the British Government but he rejected all. He was a staunch opponent of the British government and its laws and therefore decided not to work for the British.

In 1891, he married Javerbehen and the couple had two children. His daughter, Maniben Patel (1903-1990), was an activist while his son, Dahyabhai Patel (1905-1973) was a member of the parliament of India. 

Patel shifted his practice to Ahmedabad. He became a member of the Gujarat Club where he attended a lecture by Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi’s words deeply affected Vallabhai and he soon adopted Gandhi’s principles to become a staunch follower of the charismatic leader. That is how deeply Gandhi’s words had affected him. He didn’t know that he would change India and start a successful career.

In 1917, Sardar Vallabhbhai was elected as the Secretary of the Gujarat Sabha, the Gujarat wing of the Indian National Congress. In 1918, he led a massive "No Tax Campaign" that urged the farmers not to pay taxes after the British insisted on tax after the floods in Kaira . The peaceful movement forced the British authorities to return the land taken away from the farmers. His effort to bring together the farmers of his area brought him the title of 'Sardar'. He actively supported the non-cooperation Movement launched by Gandhi. Patel toured the nation with him, recruited 300,000 members and helped collect over Rs.1.5 million.

In 1928, the farmers of being lost again faced a problem of "tax-hike". After prolonged summons, when the farmers refused to pay the extra tax, the government seized their lands in retaliation. The agitation took on for more than six months. After several rounds of negotiations by Patel, the lands were returned to farmers after a deal was struck between the government and farmers’ representatives.

In 1930, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was among the leaders who were imprisoned for participating in the famous Salt Satyagraha movement initiated by Mahatma Gandhi. His inspiring speeches during the "Salt Movement" transformed the outlook of numerous people, who later played a major role in making the movement successful. He led the Satyagraha movement across Gujarat when Gandhi was under imprisonment, upon request from the congress members. 

Sardar Patel was freed in 1931, following an agreement signed between Mahatma Gandhi and Lord Irwin, the then Viceroy of India. The treaty was popularly known as the Gandhi-Irwin Pact. The same year, Patel was elected as the President of Indian National Congress in its Karachi session where the party deliberated its future path. Congress committed itself towards the defense of fundamental and human rights. It was in this session that the dream of a secular nation was conceived. 

During the legislative elections of 1934, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel campaigned for the Indian National Congress. Though he did not contest, Sardar Patel helped his fellow party mates during the election.

In the 1942 Quit India Movement, Patel continued his unwavering support to Gandhi when several contemporary leaders criticized the latter’s decision. He continued travelling throughout the country propagating the agenda of the movement in a series of heart-felt speeches. He was arrested again in 1942 and was imprisoned in the Ahmednagar fort till 1945 along with other Congress leaders.

Sardar Patel’s journey often saw a number of confrontations with other important leaders of the congress. He voiced his annoyance at Jawaharlal Nehru openly when the latter adopted socialism in 1936. Patel was also wary of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and considered him to be "keen on more power within the party”.

The separatist movement lead by Muslim League leader Mohammed Ali Jinnah led to a series of violent Hindu-Muslim riots across the country just before the independence. In Sardar Patel’s opinion, the open communal conflicts incited by the riots had the potential to establish a weak Government at the Centre post-independence which will be disastrous for consolidating a democratic nation. Patel went on to work on a solution with V.P. Menon, a civil servant during December 1946 and accepted his suggestion of creating a separate dominion based on religious inclination of states. He represented India in the Partition Council.

After India achieved independence, Patel became the first Home Minister and also the Deputy Prime Minister. Patel played a very crucial role in post-independence India by successfully integrating around 565 princely states under the Indian Dominion. The British Government had presented these rulers with two alternatives - they could join India or Pakistan, or they could stay independent. This clause magnified the difficulty of the process to mammoth proportions. Congress entrusted this intimidating task to Sardar Patel who started lobbying for integration on August 6, 1947. He was successful in integrating all of them barring Jammu and Kashmir, Junagarh and Hyderabad. He eventually dealt with the situation with his sharp political acumen and secured their accession. The India that we see today was a result of the efforts put in by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.

Patel was a leading member of the Constituent Assembly of India and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was appointed on his recommendation. He was the key force in establishing the Indian Administrative Service and the Indian Police Service. He took a personal interest in initiating a restoration endeavor of the Somnath Temple in Saurashtra, Gujarat. Patel dealt ruthlessly with Pakistan’s efforts to invade Kashmir in September 1947. He oversaw the immediate expansion of the army and marked improvement of other infrastructural aspects. He often disagreed with Nehru’s policies, especially about his dealings with Pakistan regarding the refugee issues. He organized multiple refugee camps in Punjab and Delhi, and later in West Bengal.

Gandhi had profound effect on Patel’s politics and thoughts. He pledged unwavering support to the Mahatma and stood by his principles. While leaders including Chakravarthy Rajagopalachari and Maulana Azad criticized Mahatma Gandhi's idea that the civil disobedience movement would compel the British to leave the nation, Patel extended his support to Gandhi. Despite the unwillingness of the Congress High Command, Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel strongly forced the All India Congress Committee to ratify the civil disobedience movement and launch it without delaying further. Upon Gandhi’s request he gave up his candidacy for the post of the Prime Minister of India. He suffered a major heart attack after Gandhiji’s death.  Although he recovered, he attributed it to having lamented silently for the loss of his mentor.

Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's health started declining in 1950. He realized that he was not going to live much longer. On November 2, 1950, his health became even worse and he had to stay in bed. He died because of a heart attack on December 15, 1950.

2017 Atlantic hurricane season

The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active since 2012. It officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30. It was an extremely active and tragic season. With a damage total of at least $282.16 billion (USD), it was the costliest season on record. With over 3,300 deaths, 2017 was the deadliest season since 2005. More than 99.7% of the season's damage was due to Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Nate, was the worst natural disaster in Costa Rican history. Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate had their names retired due to their high damage costs and loss of life. Featuring 17 named storms, 10 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes, the 2017 season is the fifth active season.

Tropical Storm Arlene in April was the first storm of the season that formed on April 19. This was the third consecutive season in which storms form before the official start of the hurricane season. In late August, Hurricane Harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Wilma in 2005 and the first Category 4 hurricane since Charley in 2004. It also tied the record for the costliest tropical cyclone on record along with the most rainfall dropped by a tropical cyclone in the United States. In early September, Hurricane Irma became the first Category 5 hurricane to impact the northern Leeward Islands on record. It later hit the Florida Keys as a Category 4 hurricane. Irma is the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. In late September, Hurricane Maria became the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the island of Dominica on record; and later it made landfall in Puerto Rico as a high-end Category 4 hurricane. Most of the deaths from this season occurred from Maria, and caused a human crisis in Puerto Rico. In early October, Hurricane Nate became the fastest-moving hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico while also becoming the fourth hurricane of the year to make landfall in the contiguous United States. Slightly over a week later, Hurricane Ophelia became the easternmost major hurricane in the Atlantic basin on record, and later impacted most of Northern Europe as an extratropical cyclone. The season ended with Tropical Storm Rina, which became post-tropical on November 9.

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 2017. The names not retired from this list are being used again in the 2023 season. This was the same list used in the 2011 season, with the exception of Irma which replaced Irene. Irma was previously used in 1978, and it's only used once as an Atlantic hurricane during this season.



On April 11, 2018, the names "Harvey", "Irma", "Maria", and "Nate" were retired by the World Meteorological Organization due to the very expensive amount of damage and significant number of deaths they caused. They will not be used again for a future Atlantic hurricane. The names will be replaced with "Harold", "Idalia", "Margot", and "Nigel" for the 2023 season, respectively.

Exosome complex

The exosome complex is a protein complex which can degrade RNA strands (~stop them working). In eukaryotic cells, the exosome complex is present in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and especially the nucleolus. 

The core of the complex has a ring structure consisting of six proteins that all belong to the same class of RNases, the 'RNase PH-like proteins'.

Exosome complexes are found in both eukaryotic cells and archaea. In bacteria a simpler complex called the "degradosome" carries out similar functions.

Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge

The Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge, also called the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macao Bridge, is a group of bridges and tunnels in the Pearl River Delta. It is long. It is made up of three bridges, one tunnel, and four artificial islands. It is the longest sea crossing on Earth. The bridges cross the Lingdingyang and Jiuzhouyang sea channels. They also connect Hong Kong, Zhuhai, and Macau.

The bridge is supposed to last for 120 years. The cost of the bridge was about 126.9 billion yuan ($18.77 billion USD). At first, the cost of the bridge was supposed to be 51.1 billion yuan ($7.56 billion USD). The governments of mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, as well as some banks, helped pay for the bridge. The bridge was supposed to open in late 2016, but the bridge only finished being built on 6 February 2018. The bridge officially opened on 24 October 2018.

Gordon Wu, who was the founder of Hopewell Holdings thought of a bridge and tunnel that would connect China, Hong Kong, and Macau. This was in 1983. He said that he got the idea from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel. After that, in 1988, he showed the ideas to the government in Guangzhou and Beijing. In his idea, the bridge would start more north than the design that was actually built. He wanted the bridge to begin at Black Point near Tuen Mun, Hong Kong. It would then cross the Pearl River passing through Neilingding Island and Qi'ao Island. In his idea, the bridge would end at Tangjia and there would be a road from Zhuhai to Macau. The talks between the government and Wu stopped after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. This is because it made foreign investors concerned.

The government of Zhuhai liked this idea and they promoted it. Their name for the bridge was the Lingdingyang Bridge. In the 1990s, Zhuhai built a bridge that connected mainland China and Qi'ao Island. This bridge was supposed to be the first part of the system even though the Chinese and Hong Kong governments did not approve the plan yet. The Chinese government supported the bridge in 1997. The Hong Kong government did not say whether they supported it or not. This is because they were studying traffic between Hong Kong and China and were concerned about the effect this would have on the environment.

To begin the project and making sure things were going to go smoothly, the Advance Work Coordination Group of HZMB was created in 2003. People that worked for the governments of Zhuhai, Macau, and Hong Kong worked on planning the bridge, how the border patrol would work, and how the bridge would be paid for.

In 2009, the governments of China, Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau agreed to pay for 22% of the bridge. The rest of the money, 78%, was paid for by a lot of banks, like the Bank of China.

The construction of the bridge began on 15 December 2009 in China. Li Keqiang held a starting ceremony. Construction began in Hong Kong in 2011. The construction started later because people challenged the building of the bridge.

The last bridge tower and part of the tunnel was set up on 12 July 2016. The entire tunnel and bridge was finished in the middle of 2017. The entire project was finished in February 2018.

The entire bridge has three sections. One of them was the Main Bridge, which is and in the middle of the Pearl River. Another was the Hong Kong Link Road, which was and close to Hong Kong. The third section was the Zhuhai Link Road, which was and close to Zhuhai.

The Main Bridge is the biggest part of the HZMB project. It was built by the managing people from mainland China.

Many environmentalists said that the bridge will hurt the Chinese white dolphins that live in the Pearl River Delta. They said the construction of the bridge will hurt the dolphins' habitat. These dolphins are endangered animals. In the ten years before the bridge opened, the number of these dolphins dropped over 80%.


Gang rape

Non-binary gender

A non-binary gender (also known as being genderqueer) is any gender that is not just man or woman. As the non-binary label falls under the transgender umbrella, many people who are non-binary also identify as transgender. Some non-binary people experience gender dysphoria. The idea that there are only two genders (man and woman) is called the gender binary. A non-binary gender is any gender that is not exclusively part of this gender binary.

Gender identity is different from sexual or romantic orientation. Non-binary people have many sexual and romantic orientations, just as any other gender group.

Examples of non-binary genders include agender, bigender, and genderfluid.

Some non-binary people may use gender-neutral words to describe themselves. Many non-binary people prefer to be called the pronoun "they" instead of "she" or "he". Other pronouns like "xe" or "ey" may be used, these are known to be neopronouns. This also includes noun-self pronouns, such as "bunself," in which the pronoun is tied directly to an alternative expression of gender. This is most common with xenogenders, in which the gender is described by the closest approximation of gender the individual feels and/or is most accurate. While gender neutral pronouns have existed in many languages and cultures, specific neopronouns in English can be found as early as the 1920's in David Lindsay's "A Voyage to Arcturus" in which the neopronoun "ae" is used. However, as individuals, nonbinary may choose whatever pronouns suit them best. 

The gender-neutral formal title that is generally used instead of "Mr." or "Ms." is "Mx.", which is pronounced like "mix" or "mux".


Cisgender

Cisgender (often known as cis) is a term for people whose gender identity matches the sex that they were assigned at birth. "Cisgender" may also be defined as those who have "a gender identity or perform a gender role society considers appropriate for one's sex". It is the opposite of the term "transgender".

Tihar (festival)

Tihar also known as Deepawali is a Hindu festival. It is celebrated for 5 days. It is celebrated mainly in Nepal and the Indian states of Assam and Sikkim. It is also celebrated in Darjeeling district of West Bengal. It is the festival of lights. In this festival "diyas" are lit inside and outside the houses to make it bright at night. It is known as "Swanti" among the Newars and as "Diwali" among Madhesis. Set in the Vikram Samvat calendar, the festival begins with Kaag Tihar in Trayodashi of Kartik Krishna Paksha. It ends with Bhai Tika in Dwitiya of Kartik Sukla Paksha every year.

Tihar is the second biggest festival in Nepal after Dashain. In this festival animals like crows, dogs, cows, and oxen are also worshipped. People make "Rangolis" on the floor of living rooms or courtyards. They use materials such as colored rice, dry flour, colored sand or flower Petals to make these Rangolis. Rangolis are made for welcoming Gods and Goddesses of Hinduism mainly Goddess Lakshmi.

Kaag Tihar (Crow Festival) is the first day of Tihar. In this day the crow is worshipped. Hindus regard crows as the messengers of Yamraja, the god of death. People worship it to bring good luck in their houses.They also give food to kaag or crows on that day..

The second day is called Kukur Tihar (Dog Festival). In this day, people offer garlands, tika and delicious food to dogs. Dogs are important animals in Hindu mythology. It is believed that Bhairava, an incarnation of Lord Shiva, had a dog as a vahana (vehicle). It is also believed that Yama, the god of death, had two guard dogs – each with four eyes. The dogs are said to watch over the gates of Naraka, the Hindu concept of Hell. Due to this belief, this day is also known as Naraka Chaturdashi.

The morning of the third day is Gai Tihar (worship of the cow). In Hinduism, cow is the symbol of prosperity and wealth. In ancient times cows were very useful. Their milk, dung, even urine was used for purpose like purification. So, on this day people worship cow by garlanding and feeding them with the best grass. They clean and decorate the houses. Doorways and windows are decorated by garlands made of Saya Patri (marigolds) and makhamali ("Gomphrena globosa") flowers.

In the evening Laxmi, the goddess of wealth is worshipped. She is worshipped by lighting oil lamps (Diyo) or candles on doorways and windows. It is believed that in this day she visits her followers and gives them blessings. At night the girls enjoy playing "Bhailo" by singing and dancing. They visit many houses with musical instruments. They collect money as a tip from houses and share the money amongst themselves.

From the third day onward Tihar is celebrated with "Deusi" and "Bhailo" with light and fireworks. Boys sing Deusi and the girls sing Bhailo. In return, the home owners give them money, fruit and "selroti" (a Nepali roundel made of rice flour and sugar). Social workers, politician, and young people also visit local homes. They sing these songs and collect money for social activities.

Laxmi Prasad Devkota, who is regarded as the greatest poet of Nepali language, was born on this day. He was named after the Laxmi Puja.

There are 3 different kinds of pujas on the fourth day. Mainly ox is worshipped in this day by giving different foods. It is observed as Goru Tihar or Goru Puja (worship of the oxen). People who follow Vaishnavism perform Govardhan Puja. Govardhan Puja is worship towards Govardhan mountain. Cow dung is taken as representative of the mountain and is worshiped. Another type of puja is Mha Puja (worship of self). It is done by the people of Newar community during the night. This day is seen as the beginning of the new Nepal Sambat calendar year.

The fifth and last day of Tihar is called "Bhai Tika". On this day sisters apply "tilaka" or "tika" on the foreheads of their brothers. This is done to ensure the long life of their bothers and thank them for the protection they provide. It is believed that, Yamaraj, the God of Death, visited his sister Goddess Yamuna's house. He stayed there for five days so Tihar is also called "Yamapanchak". He was pleased with the Hospitality so he asked her to make a wish. Yamuna wished that the love and faith of the brothers and sisters who meet every year on the same day remain strong and the brothers have a long life and fame. Yamaraj granted the wish.

In Bhai Tika, brothers sit on the floor while their sisters perform their "puja". During the "puja" sisters circle brothers by dropping oil on the floor from a copper pitcher. They also apply oil to their brother's hair. After that, they apply seven-color "tika" on the brother's forehead. Similarly, brothers also give "tikas" to their sisters. They also exchange gifts. This ritual is practiced for both younger and elder brothers. Those without a sister or brother join relatives or friends for "tika". This festival makes the relationship between brothers and sisters stronger.

Along with the seven-coloured "tika", sisters provide brothers with Sagun, sweets, "Makhamali" "(Gomphrena globosa)" garland. They also provide a sacred cotton thread of Tantric importance. The thread is similar to Janai and is meant to protect their bodies.

Feride Rushiti

Dr. Feride Rushiti is the founder and Executive Director of the Kosova Rehabilitation Centre for Torture Victims (KRCT) since 1999. Ms. Rushiti is graduated and specialized at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Tirana, Albania. 

Feride Rushiti is one of the pioneering activists of Human Rights in Kosovo. Soon as the war in Kosovo has ended in 1999 she established the KRCT the same year, just in order to treat survivor victims of torture where she was actively involved in providing medical and psycho-social assistance for the first post-war returnees.

Ms. Rushiti began its work in March 1999, when half of Kosovo’s population fled Kosovo, and mainly where deported to Albania; many of them had suffered from the effects of severe mental and somatic torture and other violations of human rights and other constituted rights enjoying by people

She continued in supporting victims of post-war trauma since that time and advocating strongly in promoting and advancing their rights, social inclusion, combating stigmatization, and get recognized by law for this sensitive social group.

In its 20 years of work and activity, the primary importance has been dedicated "to the survivals of wartime sexual violence in Kosovo". After almost two decades of work and uncompromising engagement of Mrs. Rushiti, survivors of sexual violence have been recognized as a civilian victim of war as a legal status. Exactly, in 2017, its advocacy brought an important government decision to fund personal retirement for survivors of wartime sexual violence in Kosovo.

Since 2007, within the Human Rights and Advocacy Sector, she has been very active in lobbying, promoting and protecting human rights for persons deprived of their liberty. In this regard, thanks to the contribution and influence of Mrs. Rushiti, the overall treatment situation and the legal framework for persons deprived of their liberty has been promoted and improved.

Feride Rushiti, as a result of her bold and unremitting commitment in the field of Rehabilitation, Human Rights, Research and Documentation, Advocacy and Lobbying, and Economic Reintegration, in 2018, the US Department of State has awarded the Award International for Courageous Women.

Feride Rushiti is an ethnic Albanian from Gjilan in eastern Kosovo.

Rushiti graduated from the Faculty of Medicine in Tirana in 1997. Later she specialized in gastroenterology.

In 1999, Rushiti traveled to Kukës in eastern Kosovo, on the Albanian border. She worked with the UN’s children’s agency and with Doctors Without Borders.

During the 1990s, more than half of the population of Kosovo moved out of the country, mostly to Albania, because of the 1998-1999 war and because of many human rights violations. Rushiti formed a group of 45 health professionals from Kosovo to provide medical and psychological support to the refugees. After the war, the refugees returned to Kosovo. This was a new beginning for protection of human rights, especially from torture and other forms of human degradation. In October 1999, Rushiti started the Kosovo Center for Rehabilitation of Torture Victims (KRCT), to provide rehabilitation, health care, and psycho-social help for the survivors of torture and violence.

In 2014, the parliament passed a law to recognize rape survivors as war victims, so they could receive pensions. In 2018, after more than ten years of advocacy by women's activists, including Feride Rushiti of The Kosovo Rehabilitation Centre for Torture Victims, they started receiving money. Survivors can receive $280 a month (about 228 Euros).



Hyperloop

A Hyperloop is a proposed type of train that would travel at very high speeds. The reason it can travel so fast is because it is inside a tube with no air. This vacuum means that there will be no friction to slow the train.

The Hyperloop is being created and tested in various places around the world, for example the United States, the Middle East and Asia.

In 2012, Elon Musk (Tesla Motors, SpaceX) proposed this technology. In 2013, he put a plan online that showed the hyperloop train taking 35 minutes to go between San Francisco and Los Angeles in the United States. He shared this technology to the world. In 2015, Musk's company built a test tube. He asked universities and companies to make the test trains. They had two competitions in 2017 to see how fast the hyperloop trains could travel. The fastest test was .

Selection sort

In computer science, selection sort is a method for sorting data such as numbers into an ordered list. It is not an efficient method of sorting data compared to more advanced algorithms such as quicksort and heapsort. However, it is very simple to build and is usually taught to beginners in computer science.

Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n).

When given a list of unsorted data, the algorithm will divide the list into two parts: one part that has all the sorted data and another part that has all the remaining unsorted data. When the algorithm first starts, there is no data in the first part as no data has been sorted yet and all the unsorted data is in the second part. The algorithm then starts to find the smallest item in the unsorted data and swap it with the left-most element of the list. The part with the sorted data is then the left-most element and the part with the unsorted data is the remaining unsorted elements. The algorithm repeats itself, by finding the smallest element within the list of unsorted data and swapping it with the left-most element, eventually getting a sorted data.

Here is an example of selection sort working on six elements:
The implementation of this algorithm requires using two nested loops. The outer loop is to work on every element in the list starting from the left-most element whereas the inner loop is to find for the smallest element within the unsorted part of the list before the smallest element is swapped with the left-most element.

A possible way of writing this algorithm in Java is shown below.
public static void selectionSort(int[] array) {

Buryatia

The Republic of Buryatia is a Mongolic federal subject in Russia. It is one of the 85 federal subjects of Russia. It is in the Siberian area of Russia. It is grouped and governed as part of the Far Eastern District. The Far Eastern District contains ten other federal subjects too. Buryatia also shares an international border with Mongolia.

In the past, the Buryats were linked and related to the Mongols. It is because of the close distance and trade with each other. They also share a similar culture. Because of this the Buryats were ruled by the Mongols many times. The Xiongnu Empire (209 BC-93 CE), Kublai Khan's Mongol Empire (1206-1368) and the Northern Yuan Empire (1368-1691), were examples when the Buryats were ruled by the Mongols. Other Mongol tribes also lived in Buryatia during that time too. The Russians, who were Europeans, first arrived in the area of the present-day Buryatia during the 17th century. They came because they were looking for furs and gold. Later during the 1920s, the area was affected by the violence of the Russian Civil War. In 1923, the Buryat-Mongolian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was formed at the end of the civil war to put in place a proper rule. The area changed size and name many times while it was in the Soviet Union. The Buryat ASSR started controlling itself in 1990. This was when the Soviet Union collapsed and Buryatia took on the name Republic of Buryatia in 1992. However, it continued to be a republic in Russia.

Buryatia is in the south central part of Siberia. Because of this it has a subarctic climate, which have long, cold winters, and short, mild summers. There is not a lot of rainfall in the area because of the climate. The landscape is mostly mountainous. Lake Baikal, the world's largest freshwater lake, is also in Buryatia. There are many animals and birds in the area. These animals and birds may appear depending on the season. The area is also rich in minerals like gold, tungsten, uranium, zinc and more.

Buryatia's population at the end of the Soviet Union decreased for some time, according to data. It is currently increasing again. A little bit more than half of the population live in cities and towns. Most of the people that live in cities and towns live in the capital, Ulan-Ude. Ethnic Buryats are about one third of the population. Russians mostly make up the other two-thirds of the population. Most ethnic Buryats practice a religion that is mixed with Buddhism and Shamanism, which is a belief that worships spirits and nature. On the other hand, ethnic Russians mostly practice Orthodox Christianity. Russian is taught and used commonly in Buryatia.

Binary search

In computer science, binary search is a method used for finding an item in a sorted list. It is an algorithm that is more efficient than linear search, which will go through every item in the list of items to find a particular item. However, the given list of items must be sorted first before a binary search algorithm can be used.

The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly splitting the sorted list into two and working on the part of the list that may contain the item that you are looking for until the final list contains only one item.

First, the algorithm must be given a sorted list and the item to look for, called the target value. The algorithm then compares the middle item of the sorted list with the target value. If the middle item is the same as the target value, then the position of that middle item in the sorted list is returned by the algorithm. If the middle item is larger than the target value, then the algorithm will repeat the previous step, but this time only working on the lower half of the sorted list (where all the items are smaller than the middle item). The same is done if the middle item is smaller than the target value, but the algorithm will repeat the previous step on the upper half of the sorted list (where all the items are larger than the middle item).

The position for the middle item is found using the following formula (round down to the nearest whole number):

formula_1

As the algorithm will divide the sorted list into two parts, each iteration thus makes the size of the search smaller by half, which makes it very efficient when searching in a large list of items.

Here is an example of searching for the number 84 in a list of 9 numbers. The following is a table showing the 9 numbers in increasing order and their list positions:

The following is a table showing each step of the binary search algorithm. The middle item in the sorted list is in bold.

In this case, position 7 is returned by the algorithm after 3 steps. If the item is not inside the sorted list of items, the binary search algorithm will keep trying until the position of the smallest item is larger than the position of the biggest item before it will return as an unsuccessful search.

The implementation of this algorithm requires using a while loop, which will check if the position of the smallest item is larger than the position of the biggest item. Inside the loop, the algorithm will then check if the middle item is equal to, smaller than or bigger than the target value.

A possible way of writing this algorithm in Java is shown below.

public static int binarySearch(int[] array, int target) {

A small part of the reserve is in the northern side of the East-West Highway. It is there to create a path for seasonal Migration of wildlife into the Sivalik Hills. The Syali River forms the eastern boundary of this national park. The international border with India makes the national park’s southern and western boundary.

The Indian Tiger Reserve Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary is in the southern part of this reserve. It is a protected area of . It represents the "Tiger Conservation Unit (TCU) Sukla Phanta-Kishanpur". It covers a block of alluvial grasslands and subtropical moist deciduous forests.

The area was a hunting ground for Nepal's ruling class. It was declared a Royal Hunting Reserve in 1969. In 1973, the area was changed into "Royal Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve". At first it had an area of . The area was made bigger to its present size in the late 1980s. A buffer zone of was added in May 2004. In 2017, the status of the protected area was changed to a national park.

They grow in the marshes around the seven small lakes. The main forest type is sal. Khair and sissoo grow by the side of rivers. The grassland being covered by trees is a major threat to the long-term existence of the main plants. Trees cover any grasses growing under them, mainly those that need more sunlight. Tree seeds are spread all over the grasslands. They mostly germinate near existing trees. Also, trees help in the growth of shade-loving grasses and prevent the growth of sun-loving species. This process of succession usually converts grassland into woodland over time.

Solicitor general

A solicitor general is a specific job in common law places. Solicitors general in different countries may have different jobs or powers. Usually, the solicitor general is the government's lawyer.

In the United States, the solicitor general is the government's lawyer in Supreme Court cases. Congress created the job in the 1870s. About two thirds of the cases in the Supreme Court involve the government. The solicitor general does not always argue them personally. He or she can send an assistant or other government lawyer to do it. When the government loses a case in the lower court, the solicitor general decides whether or not to appeal it and make it a Supreme Court case.

In Australia, the solicitor general also acts as the government's lawyer and represents the country in international cases.

Balikbayan box

Most of the time the box is sent to its destination by people who work as "freight forwarders" who know a lot about shipping balikbayan boxes by sea, the boxes can be brought by Filipinos returning to the Philippines on air flights.

The balikbayan box was invented sometime in the 1980s, in the United States because there were a lot of overseas Filipino workers in the country. The first freight forwarder to give balikbayan box services was Rico Nunga who founded REN International in Los Angeles, California in 1981.

In 1982, Ramon Ungco, a Filipino living in New York City, founded Port Jersey Shipping International. Many people think these two companies are the “pioneers” of door-to-door delivery of balikbayan boxes, which back then they had to pay import duties when the boxes got into the Philippines.

The now-changed Section 105 of the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines gives duty- and tax-free privileges to balikbayan boxes taken to the Philippines by overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in recognition of the large impact of their contribution and sacrifices outside of the Philippines as well as bringing a lot of foreign exchange annually that helped the national recovery effort at that time. 

This let tax-free entry of personal goods in the country from Filipinos overseas. People then started sending balikbayan boxes through friends and their co-workers who were going back to the Philippines.

After the September 11 attacks in the US and the passage of the Patriot Act by the US Congress, the United States Department of Homeland Security's Out-Bound Exam Team started searching balikbayan boxes.
It was so long and strict, the boxes arrived up to three weeks late at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement inspection facility. 

This made it take longer to get a box through, from 21 days to 30 plus days. The inspections also had balikbayan boxes opened, and people were angry about pilferage and mishandling. The Philippines Bureau of Customs also did 100% inspections which caused the deliveries to arrive really late. 

The inspections had to happen because of some individuals who use balikbayan boxes to get commercial items through without paying taxes or smuggle contraband. Since balikbayan box shipping is consolidated, even one illegal item will affect all 400 or so items inside the container. The inspection was made better using high performance X-ray machines.

In 2012, these delays were made even worse since the City Of Manila decided to stop trucks from driving along the route to and from the Port of Manila, causing long delays in releasing and transporting not only balikbayan boxes but all cargoes, domestic and international. 

Most balikbayan box companies, which are based in Parañaque City close to the airport, couldn’t operate because of the truck ban until it was settled.

To protect consumers, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), using its Philippine Shipper's Bureau, does regular accreditation of international freight forwarders and tells consumers not to use the services of unaccredited and incredibly cheap shipping companies.

Balikbayan boxes may have things the sender thinks the recipient wants, regardless of whether the things can be bought in the Philippines, such as non-perishable food, toiletries, household items, electronics, toys, designer clothing, or things hard to find in the Philippines for cheap prices. A balikbayan box meant for airplanes is designed to follow to airline luggage restrictions and many Filipino stores sell them. Some boxes are sold with a cloth cover and side handles. Others are secured with lots of tape or rope, and so, the shippers don’t confuse it with an ordinary moving box that is lightly wrapped. The balikbayan boxes come in three standard sizes which are: 
Shipped boxes are taken straight away to the recipient, usually the family of the overseas Filipino.

Part of the attraction of the balikbayan box is because it is important to the economy, which allows cheaper bulk shipment of items versus sending them one at a time or in smaller boxes through postal services. The bad thing though is it takes longer to reach it’s destination by container ship, which most of the time needs several weeks, along with there being no certain delivery date. The balikbayan box is a modern version of the general Philippine practice of "pasalubong", where travellers within or outside the country are culturally expected to bring home gifts to family, friends and colleagues. The balikbayan box gives connections between family inside the Philippines and those who are abroad, and give goods to the family within the Philippines.


Asia Bibi blasphemy case

Asia Bibi blasphemy case involves the conviction of a Pakistani Christian woman, Asia Noreen , for blasphemy by a Pakistani court. She was sentenced to death in 2010. However, she was acquitted by the Supreme Court in 2018.

In June 2009, while harvesting berries from a field, Asia was seen drinking water from a communal cup by some village women of that area. It was considered offensive by the women due to her religion, and the cup was labelled "contaminated". This resulted in an argument between them, and the women accused her of blasphemy.

In 2010, a judge in Sheikhupura sentenced Asia to death, which was upheld by the Lahore High Court. Petitions were sent for her release, including one sent by Pope Francis.

Noreen's husband appealed to the high court. Salman Taseer, the Governor of Punjab, supported Noreen throughout and requested President Asif Ali Zardari to pardon her.
Due to this support, Taseer was killed by his guard Mumtaz Qadri.

Several appeals were made during this period and the High Court upheld the decision. In October 2014, Lahore High Court rejected her appeal.
In November 2014, her lawyer appealed to the Supreme Court.

On 31 October 2018, the Supreme Court panel chaired by Justice Saqib Nisar, acquitted Asia Bibi. Although the majority supported the decision, it resulted in protests by the Islamic parties, mainly Tehreek-e-Labaik.

Geographical renaming

Geographical renaming is when a place's name gets changed. 

There can be several reasons for geographical renaming.

One such reason is countries joining together to form a new country. For example, after the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland joined together in 1701, they formed the United Kingdom. When Ireland joined in 1801, the unified country became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

A second reason is a country splitting apart to form new ones. For example, after Czechoslovakia split in 1992, it became two new countries, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Also, after Ireland gained independence from Britain, the region of Northern Ireland stayed in the UK. Therefore, the country's name changed from United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland to what it is today, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

A third reason could be a new government replacing or overthrowing the old one. After the Communist Party took overthrew the Russian Empire's emperor, the Tsar, and changed the country's name to the Soviet Union, the city of Saint Petersburg also changed to Leningrad. This was because the Communist Party wanted to honor its leader, Vladimir Lenin, and symbolize the Soviet Union's turning away from Russia's system of absolute monarchy, the Tsardom, that ruled before they did, since Saint Petersburg was named after Peter the Great, who was the Tsar that founded the city. When the city of New Amsterdam, founded by Dutch colonists in North America, was lost to the British Empire, it was renamed New York City after the Duke of York.

A fourth reason could be changing a place's name to replace a name given by former colonizers with the name given by native people, and many more. For example, after India gained independence from Britain, they changed the name of the city Bombay to Mumbai.

A fifth reason could be the change of standard spelling rules in the local language. When Pinyin was made the official romanization, or writing Mandarin Chinese using the Roman alphabet, in mainland China after the Chinese Communist Party took over, the spellings of many Chinese place names changed, including Peking becoming Beijing and Nanking becoming Nanjing. Even though the pronunciations of Chinese place names in Mandarin Chinese were not any different before the changing of spelling, the older spellings did not accurately show their pronunciation. Therefore, the pronunciation of Chinese place names in other languages, or their exonyms, were based on their spelling rather than the Mandarin pronunciation, which is why they sound so different from each other. In order to teach people how to correctly pronounce Mandarin Chinese, the CCP made Hanyu Pinyin the only accepted romanization in mainland China. Even though Taiwan also speaks Mandarin, the spellings of Taiwanese place names, including Taipei and Kaohsiung, is according to the older spelling rules for Chinese place names. This is because many Taiwanese do not want to use Hanyu Pinyin, even though it is the standard romanization of Mandarin Chinese worldwide, because it was created by the Communist Party of China.

Chinese place names

Chinese place names are the names of places in China. Since the Chinese language has not had any sort of phonetic alphabet until only about a few hundred years ago (compared to the thousands of years the Chinese characters have been used), there has been a lot of confusion on naming places in Chinese. Since Chinese characters are a logographic writing system, meaning that the writing mainly shows the words' meaning rather than its pronunciation, it can be used to write down words in many different languages. On top of all this, the Chinese language is not one unified language, but an entire branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. Many of the Chinese languages or dialects are mutually unintelligible, which means a speaker of one language or dialect cannot understand a speaker of another unless one of them already knew the other's language or dialect. For example, Mandarin and Cantonese are both dialects of Chinese, but they are so different from each other than their speakers cannot understand the other unless at least one speaker knew both. Therefore, knowing which spoken dialect to use when writing out the name in the Roman alphabet, which is a phonetic writing system and not a logographic one, can be challenging. For example, while the name of the city is written as 北京 in Chinese, it is called "Běijīng" in Mandarin and "Bak1 Ging1" in Cantonese.

In mainland China, most place names are in Mandarin Chinese, the country's official spoken language. Even though the sounds of Mandarin Chinese have not changed for a long time, there were many different ways to write Chinese place names in Mandarin using the Roman alphabet, or many different kinds of romanizations. This created a lot of confusion and misinformation for non-Chinese speakers on what to call Chinese place names. For example, Beijing was spelled Peking, Nanjing was called Nanking, Tianjin was spelled Tiantsin, and Qingdao was spelled Tsingtao. These many spelling systems caused confusion among non-Chinese speakers and therefore whatever name speakers of other languages called place names ended up sounding very different from Mandarin Chinese. In order to teach people how to correctly pronounce Mandarin Chinese, to mainland Chinese and non-Chinese alike, the Chinese Communist Party made Hanyu Pinyin the only accepted romanization in official use and banned all other romanizations in official use in mainland China. Peking became Beijing, Nanking became Nanjing, Tiantsin became Tianjin, and Tsingtao became Qingdao. While the pronunciation of these place names stayed the same in Mandarin, it allowed non-Chinese speakers, especially English speakers, to say Chinese place names much more accurately to their Mandarin pronunciations.

However, in the autonomous regions, places in China where certain minority groups make up a large part of the region's population, many place names changed back from Chinese to the local languages in order to represent the local languages. For example, the city of Dihua (迪化) was changed back to Urumqi, which is the name of the city in the local Uyghur language, after the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region was formed.

In Taiwan, where Mandarin Chinese is also the official language, the spelling of place names tends to be inconsistent. The names of Taiwanese cities are usually in Chinese postal romanization. This is why the cities are spelled Taipei, Kaohsiung, and Taichung instead of Taibei, Gaoxiong, and Taizhong, which is how they would be spelled in Hanyu Pinyin. This is the case because many Taiwanese dislike using Hanyu Pinyin (even though it is the standard romanization of Mandarin Chinese worldwide) because it was created by the Chinese Communist Party, which many Taiwanese do not like. While within northern Taiwanese cities most names of streets, districts, and subway stops are in Hanyu Pinyin (since Hanyu Pinyin is generally more accepted in the north), cities in southern Taiwan use many different spelling systems simply to resist using Hanyu Pinyin. In several cases, the exact same street can be spelled several different ways. For example, in Banqiao, Xinzhan Road (新站路) is spelled "Shinjann Rd." on one section and "Sin Jhan Rd." on another.

Chukotka Autonomous Okrug

The Chukotka Autonomous Okrug is the farthest east of all 85 federal subjects of Russia. It is located in the Asian part of Russia. It is grouped and governed as part of the Far Eastern District. The Far Eastern District contains ten other federal subjects too. Chukotka also shares an international sea border with Alaska of the United States.

In ancient times, the present area of Chukotka was joined with North America by a land bridge known as Beringia. It was believed that humans first migrated to the Americas using this route. Later, the area was home to the Chukchi people and other natives. Some of these natives are related to the Inuit. By the 17th century, the Russians first arrive to gain control of the natives. At first, not much attention was given to the remote land of Chukotka. But its natural resources and the ability to use the area to attack land further away was soon discovered. The Russians then made multiple attempts to bring the natives under their control by force. However, these attempts failed. The Russians finally made peace with the Chukchis in 1778. Through the 19th and 20th centuries, other foreign powers also attempted to claim the land and resources in the region. They were instead driven away by the Russians. The Russians were increasingly worried about their presence. During the Soviet Union, the natives were brought under state's control and made to resettle. Multiple gulags were also built in the area. Tin and much later gold was mined from the area after the start of World War II. The tin and gold were used to supply the war efforts. In 1991, at the collapse of the Soviet Union, Chukotka declared its separation to become a subject of Russia. It continues to remain as an autonomous okrug till today.

Chukotka is the eastern most point of Russia and mainland Asia. It is separated from Alaska, United States, by the Bering Strait and the International Date Line. Chukotka is found in the north-eastern part of Siberia. Because of this it has a polar tundra climate, which have long, cold winters, and short, mild summers. There is not a lot of rainfall in the area because of the climate. The ground is mostly frozen as well. The landscape is mostly barren, with limited animals and plants. The area however is rich in minerals. The Wrangel Island found north of Chukotka is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Chukotka's population has been decreasing since the end of the Soviet Union according to data. About 65% of the population live in cities and towns. Ethnic Chukchis compose of roughly a third of the population. Russians make up about half the population. People of other local ethnicity make up the rest of the population. Most Chukchis either practice Shamanism, which is a belief that worships spirits and nature, or Orthodox Christianity. Russian is taught and used commonly in Chukotka. The Chukchi language usage is decreasing and is used mostly at home. There are currently attempts to make it popular again.

The economy of Chukotka is mostly reliant on mining of minerals, like coal, gold, natural gas and oil. Most of Chukotka's population take jobs under big companies that are involve in mining. The rest of the rural population continue to practice reindeer herding, whale hunting, and fishing. The growing of crops and rearing of animals are mostly not possible because of the climate. Besides that, sea trade via the Northern Sea Route is expected to improve the economy. This sea route is expected to become ready in the future.

The Governor of Chukotka is the leader of the okrug. The Governor is chosen by public vote every five years. The Duma of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, is the okrug's parliament. The Duma members of parliament are chosen similarly by the public every five years. There are now 15 members of parliament. The majority of these lawmakers in the Duma are currently from the United Russia party. The United Russia part is the ruling party of Russia. Roman Abramovich, a former governor of Chukotka, is famous for being the owner of Chelsea Football Club. He has donated more than US$2.5 billion to build schools, hospitals and buildings in Chukotka.

Chukotka does not have railroads or many roads, making travel difficult. Most long-distance travel is by sea or air. The okrug has several airports, such as the Ugolny Airport. However, there are no international flights. Special permits are needed to enter Chukotka because the area is along an international border.

Grampu is an old man. He lives with his two grandkids, Oobi and Uma. Their parents and grandma are never seen or talked about, so Grampu is the only one who takes care of them. He likes to teach them about the world. He shows them how to do new things. As a running gag (repeated joke) in the show, Grampu is very unlucky and usually has to clean up messes that the kids make.

Grampu's favorite things to do are cooking and growing plants in his garden. When he is in the kitchen, he wears a big chef's hat and an apron. He is in love with Inka, an old woman from France who is Oobi's piano teacher. Grampu and Inka like to go on dates and eat fancy food.

Grampu has hazel eyes and doesn't wear any clothes. His hand is in a different position from the other characters. His fingers are curled in a fist instead of being extended, making him taller and giving him a toothless look.

Grampu was made by Josh Selig, the maker of the whole show. Josh Selig wanted to show a non-traditional family: a family that was different from most ones shown on TV. This is why he came up with the idea for Oobi and Uma to live with their single grandpa.

In the first episodes of "Oobi", which were short two-minute stories, Grampu was a secondary character who did not show up very much. When the show was turned into a longer half-hour program, Grampu got a bigger role. The show writers used him as a (a contrasting character) to the kids, or as someone to give them advice. Grampu appeared more than he used to, and he was part of almost every single episode.

The person who played the role of Grampu was Tyler Bunch. Bunch is a puppeteer (an actor who works with puppets) known from the show "Sesame Street". While he was playing the part of Grampu, Bunch had to never shave his arm, so that Grampu would look like an old, hairy man. This was different from the other actors, who all had to shave their arms because they played kid characters. Bunch had a manicurist who filed his nails every week during filming.

Grampu has gotten a good reception from viewers and critics. Many parents who watched "Oobi" with their kids thought he was the funniest part of the show. In an interview, Josh Selig said "many mothers seem to have developed a 'thing' for Grampu." , a writer of comedy books, called him "a hilarious character" in his book "Alternadad". He also wrote that Grampu seemed like a "children's TV character with whom we could spend an afternoon if [he] magically came to life."

The newspaper "St. Paul Pioneer Press" included Grampu as a good example of an unusual family unit in children's TV. In a satirical article that made fun of people wanting to keep gay and single parents out of media for kids, the newspaper called attention to Grampu being a single stay-home parent with a foreign girlfriend (Inka).

Grampu has appeared in media outside of the "Oobi" show. From 2006 to 2013, toy versions of Grampu's puppet eyes (made of the material acrylic) were sold on an online shopping site called OobiEyes.com. They were available in different sizes for kids' and adults' hands.

In 2007, Grampu appeared several times on a talk show called "" when it featured clips from "Oobi". They were shown in a part called "What the Kids Are Watching", when the host Joel McHale made comments about funny scenes from kids' shows. Grampu also appeared in a video by the YouTube star Shane Dawson in November 2009, when he imitated Oobi and Grampu with his own hands.

In "Oobi: Dasdasi", a spin-off of the original "Oobi" show made in 2012, Grampu was reimagined as "Grandpa", a new character with a similar role.

Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge

The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is a 4-lane steel bridge in Nanjing that crosses the Yangtze River. It has two levels. The top level is a road for cars, buses, and trucks. There is also a sidewalk for people on foot. That part is 4588 meters or 15,052 feet long. The bottom level is a railroad for trains. That part is 6772 meters or 22,218 feet long.

It is owned, paid for, and fixed by Nanjing's government and by the Shanghai Railway Bureau.

The Mandarin Chinese name of the bridge is "Nánjīng Chángjiāng Dàqiáo", which means "the Big Bridge across the Long River in the Southern Capital". ("Chángjiāng" or "Long River" is the Chinese name for the Yangtze River, and "Nanjing" means "Southern Capital".) It is written in the traditional characters used by Chinese people on Taiwan and in Hong Kong and in the simplified characters used by mainland China.

The Yangtze River is very big and very wide. During wars, people sometimes made pontoon bridges out of many boats. Most of the time, to go from one side to the other, people needed to use a ferry. This made things pretty slow and slowed the growth of China's economy.

The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was started in 1960. Both parts were finished and opened for use in late 1968. It was the 3rd bridge across the Yangtze River, after Wuhan's bridge and the Baishatuo Bridge near Chongqing. It is still important and a landmark in Nanjing because it was the first big bridge designed and built completely by Chinese people. It also has poems and sayings by Mao Zedong and art from the Cultural Revolution.

It is also infamous as the place with the most known suicides in the world. More than 2000 people have jumped off of the bridge since it was opened.

The road across the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is National Highway 104. The same road is also part of highways 205 and 312.

The railroad across the bridge is the Beijing–Shanghai Railway. (This is the railroad for slow trains. The high-speed trains between Beijing and Shanghai use a different bridge.) The same railroad is also part of the Nanjing–Xi'an and Nanjing–Qidong Railways. It is also used for the Shanghai–Chengdu High-Speed Railway, but those trains can't go very fast across the bridge.

The bridge was constructed under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. It is covered with his sayings and calligraphy (artistic handwriting). It also has statues and pictures of strong and passionate soldiers, workers, and farmers that go along with what the words say. There are also pictures of China's growing industry.

Guangzhou Metro

The Guangzhou Metro () is the metro system of Guangzhou, Guangdong in China. It is operated by the Guangzhou Metro Corporation. It was the fourth metro system that was built in mainland China. The Guangzhou Metro was planned many times. The planning of the metro began in the 1980s and in 1993 the construction of the first line began. In 1997 the metro opened. The first line was Line 1.

The metro system has 13 lines. They are Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 5, Line 6, Line 7, Line 8, Line 9, Line 13, Line 14, Guangfo Line, and the Zhujiang New Town APM. All of these lines connect the urban core and the suburbs. The Guangfo Line connects Guangzhou and Foshan. Over seven million people ride the metro everyday and it was used 2.56 billion times. This makes the metro the fourth busiest metro in the world.

Chen Yu, who was the Governor of Guangdong from 1957 to 1967, first had an idea for a metro system in Guangzhou. In 1960 he had the groundwater levels of Guangzhou checked. In 1965 Chen Yu and Tao Zhu put out the idea to build a tunnel in Guangzhou for evacuations during war or for creating a metro. The project was called "Project Nine".

The metro system was supposed to have two lines. Chen Yu planned for a north-south line and an east-west line. The plans for these lines are very similar to Line 1 and Line 2. The east-west line was never built. The north-south line was supposed to be built by Project Nine. There wasn't enough time, money, or materials so instead of having a subway, they planned to use trolleybuses. The tunnel was finished in 1966 but it could not be used. This was because there was an unsafe section of the tunnel. There were many attempts to restart Project Nine in the 1970s, but none of these attempts restarted Project Nine.

The metro project was started as the Preparation Office of Guangzhou Metro. It was created in 1979 to try and restart Project Nine. The project was going to help reduce the traffic in Guangzhou. Before the 1980s, most underground projects in China were to prepare for war. This was the first time that something like the Guangzhou Metro was focused on traffic. China and France worked together to design the metro. Four designs were released in the Guangzhou Daily on 14 March 1988. One of the designs were chosen after getting feedback from other people. It showed a design that would become Line 1 and Line 2.

The construction of Line 1 officially began on 28 December 1992. Before that, in October 1992, workers began on a trial part of the line. Many construction techniques were used when building the metro. They were new to China and included immersed tubes and tunnel boring machines. Line 1 needed ¥12.75 billion to be built and the city government of Guangzhou raised all the money. The mayor at the time, Li Ziliu wanted to use cut-and-cover tunnels. This meant that almost 100,000 people had to leave their homes and almost of buildings had to be destroyed.

On 28 June 1997 the section of Line 1 opened for a trial. The part that was not opened was finished on 28 December 1998. The whole line was opened for sightseeing between 16 February and 2 March 1999. Line 1 was officially opened on 28 June 1999.

Pumori

Pumori () (or Pumo Ri) is a mountain on the Nepal-Tibet border. It is in the Mahalangur section of the Himalayas. Pumori lies just eight kilometres west of Mount Everest. Pumori means "the Mountain Daughter" in Sherpa language. It was named by George Mallory. "Pumo" means young girl or daughter and "Ri" means mountain in Sherpa language. Climbers sometimes refer to Pumori as "Everest's Daughter". Mallory also called it Clare Peak, after his daughter.

Pumori is a popular climbing peak. The easiest route is graded class 3, but avalanche is still a danger. Pumori was first climbed on May 17, 1962 by Gerhard Lenser on a German-Swiss expedition. Two Czechs (Leopold Sulovský and Zdeněk Michalec) climbed a new route on the south face in the spring of 1996.

An outlier of Pumori is Kala Patthar (5,643m/18,513'). It appears as a brown bump below the south face of Pumori. Many trekkers going to see Mount Everest up close will try to climb to the top of Kala Patthar.

Nearly 500 people had reached the summit of Pumori by 2005. 42 (13 after reaching the summit) people lost their lives while climbing by 2005. It's popularity increased by 2008. From the summit, high Tibetan plateau can be seen on the one side and Nepal can be seen on the other side. The western part of the Everest can also be seen from the summit. However, there have been some dangers from avalanches. Some Spanish climbing teams took heavy losses (such as in 1989 and 2001). 2015 avalanche killed and injured many people. It was likely caused by the 2015 Nepal earthquake. It is said to have started from the Pumori-Lingtren ridge.

In 1982 a group climbing to Pumori also did a ski-hike around Everest. Jim Bridwell led the climbing expedition to Pumori.

Karl Davis

Karl Davis (born January 17, 1962 in Brooklyn, NY – May 2, 1987) was an African-American fashion designer once called one of New York's most promising young designers. Davis' had six major collections, the last shown at Manhattan restaurant Caffe Roma.

"Karl Davis" “Designer Files” archival materials at Fashion Institute of Technology’s research library reveal that during his teen years Davis was taught by a friend’s mother how to operate a sewing machine, and that when he was fifteen years old, he for the first time made classic, pleated slacks for himself. Davis graduated from high school in August 1980. At age 17, he left Brooklyn and began designing.

Davis attended New York’s Fashion Institute of Technology for only one semester - six months - and while there studied pattern making. He then worked as an assistant to Carol Fertig and, too, as a freelance design assistant to Bill Blass. It was while Davis was working as design assistant that he sold first styles to Henri Bendel.

During 1984, Davis established his own collection. Initially, he was financed by his supportive, fashionable mother - Rose.

Though brief – from age 17 until shortly before his death at age 25 – Karl Davis experienced a career highly praised and of impressive achievement

"Newsweek" (10 August 1987) observed that Davis created an exclusive line of classic women’s clothing, which "New York Newsday" (4 May 1986) described as grown-up clothes not for those on a tight budget.

"New York Magazine" {17 September 1987} stated that ladies dressed in Davis-designed wardrobes would look “strong, confident, and elegant – not to mention, in many instances, frankly sexy”.

Fashion columnists of the "Dallas Morning News" (18 December 1985) reported that Davis’s work was strongly influenced by the great masters of couture, but that he managed to move forward adding his own signature of modern minimalism. The columnists, too, observed that Davis's approach to fashion and to his business were in remarkable contrast to his age.

"Taxi" (November 1986) commented that being young and having no financial backing did not intimidate Davis from creating couture clothing of the highest level; that respect should be paid to him and fashion magazine should acknowledge him and take the initiative to put him on the map; and also that a lady dressed in Davis’s clothes would not only be taken seriously, but would be praised for her good taste and silent elegance - daring to detach herself from the uniforms of a working machine. "Taxi" quoted Davis: “I love what I’m doing – making women look like women again! The lady I sell to is dressed femininely and still gains respect on a business level.” "Taxi" further observed that a customer from Henri Bendel would never suspect that the dress she just purchased was from a young designer who supported himself by making bagel sandwiches in a downtown coffee shop.

True, Davis did prepare sandwiches at “Tamala Designs With Bagel” [153 Prince Street], a SoHo clothing store with food counter in the back owned by Aggie Markowitz who reflected "[Karl] was an integral part of the downtown fashion mafia. He gave fashion commentary while he sort of made bagel sandwiches. The commentary usually came faster than the food".

"Taxi" (November 1986) quoted Davis: “Most people would rather spend money on flashy clothes that scream and spell ‘expensive’, rather than purchasing understated elegant garments".

"Prêt" (May 1986) said Davis was beginning to shake up the New York fashion scene with his elegant, dramatic cuts and sophisticated sense of style, that his designs were Inspired by the looks of Dior, Balenciaga and Chanel; and that he took a modern approach to the values and attitudes of Haute Couture and reinvented them for a new, younger generation. "Prêt" additionally observed that Davis chose to work with very basic shapes and inject something hidden or unexpected into them which he described as “classic with a twist”; that he focused primarily on playing up and enhancing the feminine form; and that to further emphasize his attention to shape, he - with a keen focus on the waist and hips for both day and evening wear - tended to stay away from loud prints and patterns and designs.

During December 1985, Davis found a backer and also was able to travel to Europe – both having significant impact on his May 1986 showing “Karl Davis Fall 1986 Collection”.

"New York Newsday" (24 August 1986) declared Davis to be “New York’s new crown prince of near couture”.

"Karl Davis" designs - priced at $80 to $500 wholesale - were sold In New York at Henri Bendel [which continued to be his major outlet], Bergdorf Goodman, Grand Hotel, Le Piccole, and Suzie's [Great Neck, NY]; in Dallas and Houston at Neiman Marcus; and in San Francisco at I. Magnin. Davis also created clothes for private clients.

Karl Davis continued designing until April 1987 – the month before his death.

22 April 1984: [Davis's] Fall Collection shown during "New American Designers Show" at Club Area [157 Hudson Street] which fashion-commentator Tavy Stone reported to be "real clothes . . . good stuff" in her "Detroit News" (29 April 1984) "What's New" column.

5 August 1985: "Fall/Holiday '85 Collection" (“Karl Davis Presents Haute Couture R.T.W. ‘85”) shown at White Columns [325 Spring Street] which was video-recorded in its entirety along with a post-show interview of Davis by Cable News Network's "Style with Elsa Klensch".

6 November 1985: [Davis's] designs shown during "Fashion Aid" benefit for Ethiopian famine relief at Palladium Discotheque [126 E. 14th Street] which was video-recorded by Ohlmeyer Communications Companies and from which the "New York Times" cited Davis's white crepe de chine gown,

1 May 1986: “Karl Davis Fall 1986 Collection” – his sixth and last formal collection - shown at Caffe Roma, a Manhattan restaurant [3 W. 18th Street]

In her [Japanese] "Mr. High Fashion" (September 1986) feature article “Karl Davis: A New, Up-and-Coming Designer Who Enjoys Dressing Up”, columnist Yoko Hamada wrote concerning Davis’s stylish way of dressing that “Although many designers dress well, it hard to find someone who loves dressing up as much as Karl. He is very fond of fashion: it’s as if he was born to enjoy wearing clothes. The clothes he wears are not shockingly avant-garde or showy. Karl is a unique dresser whose taste is classic, as well as modern, neat and refined. He creates his tasteful and sophisticated look by skillfully combining brand name clothes, antiques, and ordinary garments.”

True to his nature, Davis in1980 was voted “Best Dressed Male” of his George-Wingate-High-School [Brooklyn, NY] graduating class.

On 2 May 1987, Karl Davis died of pneumonia at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center in Brooklyn, NY. Davis’s death was due to complications from HIV/AIDS. Along with fellow-designers Perry Ellis, Chester Weinberg, Willi Smith, Tracy Mills and Mark Pennywell, reporter Carol Hymowitz in her "Wall Street Journal" (8 December 1987) article "Designer Deaths: AIDS Is Decimating The Fashion Business . . ." cites ", , , budding talent Karl Davis, who created a line of classic women's clothing . . ." as among the enormous toll of other talents in the fashion business succumbing to an alarming surge in HIV/AIDS-related casualties.

Funeral services for Davis were held 7 May 1987 at St. Mary’s Church of Christ in Brooklyn, NY, followed by interment also in Brooklyn at Cypress Hills Cemetery.

Karl Davis was survived by his parents, Rose and Lembert Davis of Brooklyn, and three sisters, Jackie and Robin, both of Brooklyn, and Andora Boyd of Virginia.

William Wilson (short story)

William Wilson is a short story written by Edgar Allan Poe in 1839. 

The theme is doppelganger. The narrator is a dying man of "a noble descent" who choses not to embody a record of his later years of unspeakable misery, and unpardonable crime-he calls himself William Wilson because, although denouncing his profligate past, he does not accept full blame for his actions, saying that "man was never thus ... tempted before". and tells the story of how he "Fell" from "grace":Years before while attending a school in england Another boy at his school looks and acts like himself, and was even born on the same day, January 19th (Poe's actual birth day) 1813. Angered at being given "good" advice William steals into the boy bedroom but is shocked to find his double now resembles himself; he runs away from the school in horror.The first Wilson goes to the bad in life, but is haunted by his good double. After being subject to admonished at Eaton [while preparing to give a profane oath at a drinking party] and his honor destroyed at Oxford [where he is exposed at trying to cheat at cards], William is haunted by his double in subsequent years, who thwarts plans described by William as driven by ambition [in Rome], revenge [in Paris], passionate Love [in Naples], and avarice [In Egypt] and even follows him to other cities [Vienna, Berlin, Moscow]. One thing William cannot understand is that while no one knows anything about his double, his double always seems to know everything about William. At Carnival time in Rome William prepares to seduce the not unwilling young wife of a elderly nobleman. When his double appears the enraged William drags his double into a anterooom and challenges him to a sword duel where he kills the double. Distracted for a second he finds instead his double a mirror Reflected at him, he sees "mine own image, but with features all pale and dabbled in blood": apparently the dead double, "but he spoke no longer in a whisper". The narrator feels as if he is pronouncing the words: "You have conquered, and I yield. Yet, henceforward art thou also dead—dead to the World, to Heaven, and to hope! In me didst thou exist—and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine own, how utterly thou hast murdered thyself.
Poe later admitted he had got the idea from a previous story by Washington Irving about a character who kills his double.

Chinese postal romanization

Chinese postal romanization was the old way of spelling Chinese place names in the Roman alphabet until the 1980s, when Hanyu Pinyin became the standard way for writing Chinese in the Roman alphabet worldwide. While mainland China uses only Hanyu Pinyin for almost all Chinese place names, Taiwan still uses Chinese postal romanization to spell their cities' names, like Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung. In this system, there are no apostrophes, dashes, or tone markers.

On 27 July 1989, a Korean Air DC-10 crashed while attempting to land in Tripoli, Libya. 75 of the 199 passengers and crew on board plus 4 persons on the ground were killed in the crash.

Flight 803 was a scheduled International passenger service from Seoul, South Korea to Tripoli, Libya with intermediate stops in Bangkok, Thailand and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. On the final approach to Tripoli, the aircraft crashed into an orchard about 1.5 miles short of the runway 27. The weather at the time of the crash consisted of heavy fog and visibility was between 100 and 800 feet.

Korean Air Flight 803 was the second aviation disaster involving a DC-10 in less than two weeks. United Airlines Flight 232 had crashed on 19 July 1989 while attempting an emergency landing in Sioux City, Iowa with 111 of the 296 people on board losing their lives.

Daewoo and Donga had multiple employees, working at construction sites of those companies' facilities, on board; they were South Korean citizens.

There were 190 South Koreans, including seven Libyans, and three Japanese nationals.

After the crash Flight 803's pilot Kim Ho-jung was quoted as saying - "The airport was shrouded in dense fog and visibility was poor when I approached. I lost contact with the control tower for 15 minutes before the crash." Libya's official news agency JANA reported that a Soviet airliner one hour before Flight 803 had rerouted to Malta rather than land in the fog. Also the instrument landing system at Tripoli International Airport wasn't working at the time of the crash.

A Libyan court found the pilot and co-pilot guilty of neglect in December 1990. They were given prison sentences of two years and eighteen months respectively. In the case of the co-pilot the sentence was suspended.

The cause of the crash was determined to be crew error in attempting a descent below decision height without the runway environment in sight.

"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer" is a humorous Christmas song. It was originally performed by husband and wife Elmo and Patsy Trigg Shropshire in 1979. It was released again in later years. It sold over 11 million copies.

On the Edison Media Research and Pinnacle Media Worldwide lists, the song was both liked and disliked. The results were reported in 2007.

There have been several parodies and cover versions of this song.

In the lyrics, a grandmother is celebrating at a Christmas Eve party with her family. Against what everyone tells her, she goes outside into a blizzard while drunk on eggnog after she forgets her medication. She is found the next day, trampled over by Santa Claus and his reindeer. 

The family wonder if all the gifts they bought for Grandma should be sent back. The answer is a strong yes.

Grandpa is unaffected by his wife's "death". He drinks beer, watches football and plays cards with Cousin Mel. 

In the music video, Elmo plays both Grandpa and Grandma. Patsy plays Cousin Mel. Grandma survives the attack and comes back through the chimney.

Also in the music video, Grandma says that a driver's license should "never" be given to a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves.

Chlorella

Chlorella is a genus of single-cell green algae. It is in the division Chlorophyta. It is microscopic in size and round in shape.

"Chlorella" has in its body two green color substances: "chlorophyll-a" and "chlorophyll b." It uses photosynthesis, similar to plants which also have chlorophyll. It multiplies rapidly, needing only carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, and a small amount of minerals to reproduce.

Many people believe "Chlorella" can serve as a possible source of food and energy. This is because its photosynthesis process can, in theory, reach 8% efficiency. This is even better than that of other highly efficient crops such as sugar cane, which are already being used for food and energy.

In 1961, Melvin Calvin of the University of California received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research on the pathways of carbon dioxide assimilation using "Chlorella".

Chlorella reproduce asexually by aplanospores. A single chlorellon cell produces at least 16 non-motile aplanospores and each one of them matures into an individual unicellular alga (chlorellon) under favourable conditions. There are no any reports of sexual reproduction in Chlorella.

Arirang

"Arirang" (; ) is a Korean folk song. It is sometimes thought of as the unofficial national anthem of Korea. There are almost 3,600 variations for 60 versions of the song. All of these have a part of the song similar to "Arirang, arirang, arariyo ()". People think that the song is almost 600 years old.

"Arirang" is on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list two times. This is because both South Korea and North Korea submitted the song for being included on the list. It was submitted by South Korea in 2012 and then by North Korea in 2014. The South Korean Cultural Heritage Administration added the song to its list of important intangible cultural assets in 2015.

People think that "Arirang" came from Jeongseon in the Gangwon Province of South Korea. According to a legend, the song came from the story of a man and a woman who fell in love. This was while they were picking camellia flowers. In one version of the story, the man can't cross the Auraji river because the water is too high. Because of this, they sing a song to show how sorrowful they were. In the second version of the story, the man tries to cross the Auraji and drowns. In that version, he sings the song after he dies.

Another theory says that the song came from Lady Aryeong. It says that "arin" came from the Jurchen word for "hometown" and a Chinese song called "Airang."

The Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders is a museum about the 1937–1938 Nanjing Massacre in Nanjing, China. It is also known as the Nanjing Massacre Museum, or the because it is also a memorial hall to remember the many Chinese people who were killed during the massacre by the Imperial Japanese Army.

The museum covers a total area of 103,000 square meters, with a building area of 57,000 square meters and the exhibition area of 20,000 square meters. It is a "National First-Class Museum" built on the site of the Jiangdong Gate mass murder in the Nanjing Massacre. Since its official opening on August 15, 1985, the museum has received more than 90 million viewers from over 100 countries and regions by the end of 2017.

Nanjing (then spelled "Nanking" in English) was China's capital city during the 1920s and 1930s. At that time, Japan was an empire that included Korea and Taiwan. During the 1930s, Japan started the Second Sino-Japanese War and tried to take over all of China. This became part of World War II, as Japan's friend Germany took over Poland and Italy joined their wars and started some of its own. When the Japanese army got to Nanjing in December 1937 and January 1938, it did not only fight the Chinese army; it also killed many other people who were not fighting at all. It also committed many, many war crimes against the people in the city. It is even hard to count how many people were killed or hurt in all, because the Japanese treated the bodies and the people so badly. The Chinese government says 300,000 people were killed and more were hurt.

To remember the people who were killed and hurt and to fight Japanese people who say nothing very bad happened in Nanjing, the city government built the Nanjing Massacre Museum in 1985. In 1995, with the city growing richer from China's Opening-Up Policy, the museum was made larger and better.

The memorial (place to remember something) consists of three major parts: a museum that shows historical records and other things from the massacre, an outdoor area, and a covered area that holds the bones of many of the people who died in the massacre. The building has about 3,000 square meters or 32,000 square feet of floor space. The rest of the museum covers another 25,000 square meters or 6 acres of land around the building. The memorial uses architecture, sculptures, and videos to show what happened during the Nanjing Massacre.
It is free to enter the Nanjing Massacre Museum. It is open from 8:30 to 4:30 from Tuesday to Sunday. The museum is closed every Monday.

You can go there by taking the underground or by buses.

Kamchatka Krai

Kamchatka Krai is one of 85 federal subjects of Russia. It is located in the Asian part of Russia. It is grouped and governed as part of the Far Eastern District. The Far Eastern District contains ten other federal subjects too.

Local Koryak people lived in the region for a long time before European explorers first arrived. They were described to be war-like. In the 17th century, Russian explorers first arrived in the area. But the area's harsh climate, land and unfriendly natives made exploration difficult. Multiple fighting later broke out between the natives and the Russians throughout the 18th century. This was because the Tsar ordered more Russian explorations of the area. In 1768-1769, the smallpox disease nearly wiped out the population. The natives were finally brought under control because of the disease. In 1854, the area saw fighting between the Russians and the British and French during the Crimean War. In 1867, after the sale of Alaska to the United States, Kamchatka loss its importance. It was because travelers were no longer stopping over the area to go to Alaska. During the last months of World War II, the area became an important point for Soviet troops to invade Japan. After the war the area became a military zone. This zone was closed off to Soviet citizens till 1990 and foreigners till 1991. Today it remains as a Krai (federal subject) within Russia.

Kamchatka is found in the far eastern part of Siberia. Because of this, it has a subarctic climate, which have long, cold winters, and short, mild summers. Rainfall in the area is unusually higher than the rest of Eastern Siberia. This is because westerly winds blow in from the Sea of Japan. The landscape is mostly mountainous, with the Sredinny Mountain Range occupying a large part of the region. The Sredinny Range has the most amount of glacier in North-East Asia. The area also has a high density of mountains that are active volcanoes. These volcanoes are included as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The area is prone to volcano eruption and earthquake. This is because it lies around the Pacific Ring of Fire. There are plenty of animals, birds and plants in the area. It is because of the good climate, geography and low human population.

Kamchatka's population at the end of the Soviet Union decreased for some time, according to data. It is currently increasing again. Most of the population live in cities and towns, like the capital, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. Ethnic Koryaks and other natives compose of a very small percentage of the population. Russians compose a great majority of the population. Most people in Kamchatka practice Orthodox Christianity, while a sizable population are irreligious. Shamanism, which is a belief that worships spirits and nature, is still practiced by some natives in the area. Russian is taught and used commonly in Kamchatka. While native languages like Koryak, Itelmen or Chuvan are hardly taught or used at home.

The economy of Kamchatka is mostly based on fishing and processing of natural resources. These resources include wood, coal and gold, involving the lumber and mining industries. Kamchatka lies along major shipping routes. It thus provide services such as ship building, repairing and the moving of goods among ships. In the past, Kamchatka was part of the region's fur trade. This fur trade was connected with places like China and Alaska.

The Governor of Kamchatka is the leader of the Krai. The Governor is chosen by public vote every five years. The Kamchatka Legislative Assembly, is the Krai's parliament. The Legislative Assembly lawmakers are chosen similarly by the public every five years. The majority of lawmakers in the Legislative Assembly are currently from the United Russia party. The United Russia party is the ruling party of Russia. The Krai was formed on 1 July 2007 from the merge between Kamchatka Oblast and Koryak Autonomous Okrug.

Generally, Kamchatka is isolated from the rest of Russia. There are no railway and road linking it with the rest of Russia. Flying is the most convenient way of entering or leaving Kamchatka. There are several airports, like the Yelizovo Airport. Flights from these airports link Kamchatka to cities further away. However, there are no international flights into the area. Kamchatka also lies along major shipping routes. These shipping routes connect Kamchatka with Alaska and East Asia by sea.

Mercy Hospital and Medical Center

Mercy Hospital and Medical Center is a 292-bed general medical and surgical Catholic teaching hospital in Near South Side, Chicago, Illinois. It was built in 1852. 

The hospital was the first chartered hospital in Chicago. In 1859, Mercy Hospital became the first Catholic hospital to affiliate with a medical school—Lind Medical School—and the first to require a graded curriculum. 

Mercy also is the hospital used by the Daley family: all of their children were born there. Mercy sold a plot of land to the north of their hospital for 60 million dollars in 2008. It is also the main women's cancer center in Illinois. 

It accepted patients from Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center and absorbed the ambulance routes when the hospital closed in 2008. In 2012, Mercy Hospital and Medical Center was ranked #35 for all hospitals in the State of Illinois and #27 in the Chicago metropolitan area by U.S. News & World Report.

On November 19, 2018, four people were shot near the hospital.

Double-layer capacitance

Double-layer capacitance is the storing of electrical energy by means of the electrical double layer effect.

Double layer capacitance is when an electrode and a liquid solution are touching each other, causing the charges to line up and allowing electricity to be stored there. The double layer is created when the electrode’s surface is charged through the application of electricity. This causes oppositely charged molecules to be attracted to the surface (since opposites attract). This first layer is well attached to the electrode surface, causing it to be semi-permanent. The second layer (with opposite charge) is held by this first layer, making it less attached to the electrode than the first layer. These two layers are separated by a single atomic layer of uncharged molecules in the solution. These alternating layers of charges have the ability to store electrical energy, in a way that depends on the amount of electricity initially applied to the electrode. Once this charge is stored in the device, the source of electricity can be removed and the circuit can still be powered from this stored electricity contained in this device, until it is used up.

The amount of electric charge stored in double-layer capacitance is linearly proportional to the applied voltage. It depends mainly on the electrode surface. The unit of capacitance is the farad.

A capacitor is a very common electrical circuit device that can store electrical energy as charge. It works based on the idea that you can have a separation between two conductive plates and store a charge on the surface of these plates. However, if too much electricity is stored in the plates, it can jump across the gap causing less energy to be stored. The amount of charge stored in the capacitor can be increased by putting a dielectric material between the plates; air plays this role if no other material is present. This helps to prevent the charge from crossing the gap between the two electrodes, which allows more charge to be stored in this manner. 
By using a solution instead of the dielectric material, more energy can be stored within the device. When the capacitor becomes charged, the positively charged molecules in the solution become attracted to the negatively charged electrode (and opposite for the positively charged electrode). These positively charged molecules then become attached to the surface of the electrode, and pull in negatively charged molecules from the solution to form a spherical shape; however, these molecules are not attached as strongly. These two layers in the solution prevent the similar charges from pushing each other apart as much leading to an increase in the amount of charge the device can store. In experiments, it has been seen that there is a voltage drop across this layer, which works in the same way as a capacitor. This led to the first use of the term "electrical double layer" in the 1850s by Helmholtz and later being changed to "electrical double layer capacitance" (EDLC). Since this double layer capacitance happens at both electrodes, the theoretical capacitance of the entire device can be raised substantially. However, there are several other factors which can come into play, causing the actual capacitance of the device to not see as much benefit as expected.

When the double layer capacitance idea is used to create a device, they are sometimes called "ultracapacitors" because they store energy by separating the charges (like a capacitor but capable of storing more energy), instead of using a chemical reaction to store electricity. This means that the devices can work correctly for a much longer period of time and charging a device like this takes less time than charging a traditional battery. However, the solution will dry up over time, causing the device to eventually fail. Currently there are several devices that use this technology, including: wireless modems, GPS devices, CMOS computer chips, solar battery operated chips, windmills, electric cars, and power tools.
The electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) has the ability to power a device for longer than a traditional capacitor, but cannot give as much instant energy as the traditional capacitor, which can discharge all at once. Rechargeable batteries can power a device for longer than the EDLC per charge, but cannot deliver as much instant energy.

Primate city

Primate cities are cities which have more people and influence than any other city. Primate cites have more than twice as many people than any other in the country. 

They are more important in resources, education, health care than the country's second largest city. Countries with primate cities often have inequality in its development, but richer countries as well as poorer countries can have primate cities.

An example of a rich country having a primate city is the United Kingdom, where its largest city London has over eight times as many people as its second largest city, Birmingham.

Bangkok is a primate city because its population is nine times bigger than the second largest city in Thailand. 70% of the country's resources go to Bangkok.

The United States has never had a primate city on a national level due to the decentralized nature of the country, and because the second largest city of the country is not far behind in population and GDP. New York City, which is the largest city and the largest economy in the United States, is for this reason not a primate city of the country. The metropolitan area of New York City has 21 million residents and Los Angeles has 16 million residents. 

Sub-national divisions can also have primate cities. For instance, New York City is New York State's primate city because its population is 32 times bigger than the second largest city of that state. New York City has 44% of the population and has 65% of the GDP of New York State.

Chicory

Common chicory ("Cichorium intybus") is a somewhat woody, perennial herbaceous plant of the dandelion family Asteraceae. It usually has bright blue flowers, rarely white or pink. 

It is often used as a food plant, and often as a coffee substitute. Many varieties are cultivated for salad leaves, chicons (blanched buds), or roots. The roots of variety "sativum" are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and food additive. 

In the 21st century, inulin, an extract from chicory root, has been used in food manufacturing as a sweetener and source of dietary fibre.

Chicory is grown as a forage crop for livestock. It lives as a wild plant on roadsides in its native Europe, and is now common in North America, China, and Australia, where it has become widely introduced. 

"Chicory" is also the common name in the United States for curly endive ("Cichorium endivia"). These two closely related species are often confused.

Fluorescence microscope

A fluorescence microscope is an optical microscope that uses fluorescence and phosphorescence to study organic or inorganic substances. "Fluorescence microscope" means any microscope that uses fluorescence to make a picture. This applies whether it is a more simple set up or a more complicated design.
Most fluorescence microscopes, especially those used in the life sciences, are of the epifluorescence design shown in the diagram. Light of the excitation wavelength illuminates the specimen through the objective lens. The fluorescence emitted by the specimen is focused onto the detector. The dichroic beamsplitter acts as a wavelength specific filter, transmitting fluoresced light through to the eyepiece or detector, but reflecting any remaining excitation light back towards the source.

White currant

The white currant, or whitecurrant is a cultivar of the red currant. They are flowering plants in the family Grossulaceae native to Europe. Usually, they grow as a shrub and can reach a height of about tall. The plants have palmate leaves, and masses of spherical, edible fruit (berries) in summer. The white currant differs from the red currant only in the colour and flavour of these fruits, which are a translucent white and sweeter.
It is sometimes mislabelled as "Ribes glandulosum", (which is the skunk currant in USA).

Unlike their close relative the blackcurrant, red and white currants are cultivated for their ornamental value as well as their berries.

Currant bushes grow best in partial to full sunlight and can be planted between November and March in well-drained, slightly neutral to acid soil. They are relatively low-maintenance plants, but are considered cool-climate plants and fruit better in northern areas. They can also be grown in large containers.

The firm and juicy fruit are usually harvested in summer. Whole trusses of fruits should be cut instead of individual fruit, and then either used, or they can be stored in a fridge. They can also be bagged and frozen.

Various forms are known including; 'White Grape', 'Blanka' and 'Versailles Blanche' (syn ‘White Versailles’), and 'White Pearl'.

The cultivar 'White Grape' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. There are also cultivars with yellow and pink fruit, called respectively yellow currants and pink currants.

The bushes can suffer from pests such as gooseberry sawfly and birds.

White currant berries are slightly smaller and sweeter than red currants. When made into jams and jellies the result is normally pink. The white currant is actually an albino cultivar of the red currant but is marketed as a different fruit.
White currants are rarely specified in savoury cooking recipes compared with their red counterparts. They are often served raw and provide a sweetly tart flavor. White currant preserves, jellies, wines and syrups are also produced. In particular, white currants are the classic ingredient in the highly regarded Bar-le-duc or Lorraine jelly although preparations made of red currants can also be found.

The berries are a good source of vitamins C and K, and are rich in iron, copper and manganese.

Power supply unit

A power supply unit (PSU) is a part of the computer that converts alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). Other parts of the computer need this DC power so that they can work. The PSU makes sure that the DC output voltage can be handled by these computer parts.

Modern personal computers always use switched-mode power supplies, which has both efficiency advantages and makes designing for multiple voltage inputs easier. This means that most PSUs can operate in different countries where the power input might change. In the UK, the voltage is 240V 50Hz, whereas in the USA the voltage is 120V 60Hz, and in Australia it is 230V 50Hz. Some power supplies have a manual switch for selecting input voltage, while others automatically adapt to the mains voltage.

Most modern desktop personal computer power supplies conform to the ATX specification, which includes form factor and voltage tolerances. While an ATX power supply is connected to the mains supply, it always provides a 5-volt standby (5VSB) power so that the standby functions on the computer and certain peripherals are powered. ATX power supplies are turned on and off by a signal from the motherboard.

Magadan Oblast

Magadan Oblast is one of 85 federal subjects of Russia. It is located in the Asian part of Russia. It is grouped and governed as part of the Far Eastern District. The Far Eastern District contains ten other federal subjects too.

In the past, Magadan was home to native Evens who didn't live in one place for long. They frequently traveled because they reared reindeer, hunted and fished. In the 17th century, the Russians, who were Europeans, first arrived in the area. They came to explore the Far East. They were looking for furs and gold. They also named the area Kolyma. Kolyma still remains as a popular name for the region. Gold and platinum were discovered in the area in the early 19th century. During Stalin's rule in the 1930s, the Soviet Union was rapidly developing because of industrialization. Therefore, there was an increase in demand for gold to pay for this industrialization. This led to many mines opening in the region. Many gulags were also opened to house the increasing forced labour population. The labourers were brought in to help dig out the minerals or make roads into the area. Magadan was famous as a result for the most number of gulag camps in the far eastern region. Prisoners-of-war during World War II were also brought to the area. After the death of Stalin in 1953, the gulags were slowly closed down and most prisoners were released. Mining activity continued with paid workers taking over the job. Living standards fell while the Soviet Union attempted to improve the economy during perestroika. This caused a lot of people to leave Magadan to find for a better life. 

Magadan is in the far eastern part of Siberia. Because of this, it has a subarctic climate with long, cold winters, and short, mild summers. There is not a lot of rainfall in the area. The landscape is mostly mountainous except in areas closer to the Sea of Okhotsk. There are plenty of animals, birds and plants in the area. The area is also very rich in minerals, like gold, silver, tin, and tungsten.

Magadan's population has gone down since the end of the Soviet Union. Most people live in cities and towns, like the capital, the city of Magadan. The population consists mostly of Russians. Ethnic Evens and other natives compose of only a small part of the population. Most people in Magadan practice Orthodox Christianity or are spiritual but not religious. Some ethnic Evens still practice Shamanism or certain aspects of it, which is a belief that worships spirits and nature. Russian is taught and used commonly in Magadan. But the local Even language is still taught in some pre-school and elementary school. It is used mostly at home.

The economy of Magadan is mostly reliant on the mining of minerals, like gold, silver and tin. In 2005, President Vladimir Putin supported reducing tax for businesses involved in mineral mining. Another major industry in the area is fishing. There are limited rearing of animals or growing of crops because of the climate. This results in having to bring in food for the people living in Magadan. Many people in the area do not have jobs. This is because a lot of companies have closed down due to the harsh climate and the poor condition of buildings and equipment. The government has allowed for the Special Economic Zone in Magadan to be created and extended till December 31, 2025. This was done to attract investors and business to come to Magadan.

The Governor of Magadan is the leader of the oblast. The Governor is chosen by public vote every five years. The Magadan Oblast Duma, is the oblast's parliament. The Duma lawmakers are chosen similarly by the public every five years. The majority of lawmakers in the Duma are currently from the United Russia party. The United Russia party is the ruling party of Russia.

Magadan is currently only connected with the rest of Russia by a road called the Kolyma Highway. There are no railways operating in the area. But there have been plans for the near future to have a railway line running towards Chukotka while cutting through Magadan. Long-distance travel can also be done by air or sea. The oblast has several airports, such as the Sokol Airport. Flights from these airports link Magadan to cities further away. There are no international flights into the area.

Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney − Spirit of Justice

Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney − Spirit of Justice (known in Japan as ) is a visual novel adventure video game. The game was developed and released by Capcom. It is the sixth game in the "Ace Attorney" video game series. The game came out for the Nintendo 3DS in Japan in June 2016. After that, in September 2016 the game came out on the 3DS in Europe and North America. It also came out on iOS and Android in September 2017. The game came out after "" which was the fifth game in the series.

The game shows the story of the three main lawyers in "Dual Destinies", Phoenix Wright, Apollo Justice, and Athena Cykes. It also introduces a new location in the game, the fictional "Kingdom of Khura'in" that was not in the other games and brings back characters from the older games.

"Spirit of Justice" is very similar to the older games in the "Ace Attorney" series. People playing the game will be one of the three main characters in the game; Phoenix Wright, Apollo Justice, and Athena Cykes and they will defend their clients in court. Each section of the game has two types of gameplay. They are the investigations and trials. In the investigations, the players have to get information from people and look for evidence. In the trials, players will use the evidence to find contradictions.

Many things that were in older games came back to "Spirit of Justice", like the "Psyche-Locks" from "" or "Perceiving" from "". New things in the game include "Divination Séances". In the divination séances, the players have to pay close attention to what happens.

The story of "Spirit of Justice" begins one year after the game before it, "Dual Destinies". The game's setting is in Los Angeles, California like all of the other games. The game also introduces a new location, the kingdom of Khura'in (which is not real). The kingdom of Khura'in in the game is in South Asia. Almost half of the game is set in the kingdom of Khura'in and the rest is in Los Angeles. Many characters come back in the game from the older games.

The game begins when Phoenix goes to Khura'in to visit Maya Fey (who came back from ""). This is because Maya was about to finish training for spirit channeling. When Phoenix gets to Khura'in, his tour guide is accused of stealing an artifact, the "Founder's Orb" and murder. Phoenix learns that Khura'in is against lawyers. This is because in Khura'in there is a law called the Defence Culpability Act where if a criminal is found guilty, then the lawyer will also be given the same punishment. He also learns that most of the lawyers in Khura'in were executed under this law. He defends Ahlbi and proves him not guilty.

In Los Angeles, Athena and Apollo are defending Trucy Wright. Trucy is the daughter of Phoenix. They are defending her against the prosecutor Nahyuta Sadhmadhi. This was after she was accused of killing someone while she was performing on stage. In Khura'in, Phoenix reunites with Maya. He then has to defend Maya after she is accused of killing a priest. Phoenix also meets a member of the Defiant Dragons. In the game, the Defiant Dragons are doing a nonviolent revolution. He finds out that the leader of the group, Dhurke Sahdmadhi is Nahyuta's father.

"Spirit of Justice" was produced by Motohide Eshiro. It was directed by Takeshi Yamazaki and Takuro Fuse. Yamazaki was in charge of the game's story. Fuse was in charge of how the game looked and how players would play the game. Most of the game's music was made by Noriyuki Iwadare. Some of the other music was made by Toshihiko Horiyama and Masami Onodera. Horiyama had also made the music for "". Capcom first began talking about it in December 2013. This was when they were thinking about ideas for the new game. The game was announced in Japan and North America in September 2015. When Capcom announced the game, it was almost 30% finished. Most of the development was finished in the end of 2015. The people making the game were already working on adding the last things in the game.

Yamazaki was the only director for "Dual Destinies". When he was finished with "Dual Destinies", he became very tired of working on "Ace Attorney" games and he wanted to stop working on those games. Eshiro wanted him to continue working on the games. Eshiro brought Yamazaki to a press conference in Taiwan and the San Diego Comic-Con. This was so that Yamazaki could meet with the media and fans of the series.

Firefighting

Firefighting is the act of trying to prevent the spread of and put out unwanted fires. The fires can be in buildings, vehicles, woodlands, and other places. A firefighter puts out fires to protect property, people and the environment.

Firefighters usually go through a lot of technical training. This includes fighting fires in buildings, cars and the woods.

One of the major hazards with firefighting is the poisonous environment made by things burning. Four major risks are smoke, oxygen deficiency, high temperatures and poisons in the air. To protect themselves from smoke, firefighters will wear a device called a breathing apparatus.

One way to put out fires is to spray them with water. The water does two things: it vaporizes when it comes in contact with fire. The water vapor leaves the fire with less oxygen, which it needs to keep burning. The other thing water does is make things cooler. That can keep the fire from burning because things will not burn if they are not hot enough.

Neo-Luddism

Neo-Luddism or new Luddism is a movement of people who are against modern technology. The word Luddite can be an offensive term to describe someone who is afraid of technology.

The movement is named after the English Luddites, who were active between 1811 and 1816. The Luddites were textile workers. They were against the new textile machinery. They believed that the machines would replace the workers over time. In response, the Luddites destroyed many of the textile machines.

Neo-Luddites are concerned about the effect technology has on the environment, people, and/or communities.

The neo-Luddite movement has connections with the anti-globalisation movement, anarcho-primitivism, and radical environmentalism.


Luddite

The Luddites were an early 19th century radical group which destroyed textile machinery as a form of protest. 

The group was protesting against the use of machinery in a "fraudulent and deceitful manner" to get around standard labour practices. They were English textile workers who took an oath to resist machinery in the textile industry. 

Luddites feared that the time spent learning the skills of their craft would go to waste as machines would replace their role in the industry. They were largely correct, but on the other hand, the textile industry grew to be a major exporter of cloth. Parliament made "machine breaking" (industrial sabotage) a capital crime with the Frame Breaking Act of 1812 .

It is not quite right that Luddites protested against the machinery itself in an attempt to halt progress. However, over time, the term has come to mean one opposed to industrialisation, automation, or new technologies in general. 

The Luddite movement began in Nottingham and ended in a region-wide rebellion that lasted from 1811 to 1816. Mill and factory owners took to shooting protesters. Eventually the movement was suppressed with military force.

Sakha

The Republic of Sakha also known as Yakutia is one of 85 federal subjects of Russia. It is in the Siberia area of Russia. It is grouped and governed as part of the Far Eastern District. The Far Eastern District contains ten other federal subjects too. Sakha is the largest federal subject of Russia. It stretches across three time zones between UTC+9 and UTC+11. The name Yakutia is also used to refer to the same area. The Yakut people speak a Turkic language.

In the past, Yakutia was home to small groups of native tribesmen that hunt to survive. In the 13th to 14 century, the Yakuts started moving north from Lake Baikal to the area. Most of the Yakuts merged or took over the lands of these native tribesmen.

The Yakuts were different from the other tribesmen because they reared cattle, horses and practiced blacksmith skills. These skills allowed them to stay longer in one place. During the 17th century, the Russians, who were Europeans, first arrived in the region. The Yakut tribes united under the famous King Tygyn Darkhan to fight the Russians. But the Yakuts lost because they did not have guns. The Russians then brought the Yakuts under their control and continued to move eastwards. Years later, many people were punished by sending them to live in Yakutia in exile. This was because Yakutia was far from most places. Between 1921 and 1923, during the Russian Civil War, the area was the last land remaining under the control of the White Russians. The area was eventually brought under the control of the Bolsheviks's Red Army. This event was known as the Yakut Revolt.

Under Stalin's rule, several gulags were opened in the area. These gulags were used to house the growing forced labour population. These labourers were brought in to mine the gold minerals to pay for the Soviet Union's industrialization. After the Soviet Union collapsed, Yakutia was given the name Republic of Sakha and continues to be a republic in Russia.

Sakha is in the north part of Eastern Siberia. Because Sakha is very big, it experiences both polar tundra and subarctic climate. Both climates have long, cold winters, and short, mild summers. There is not a lot of rainfall in the area because of the climate. The tundra climate makes the northern part of Sakha empty and mostly frozen. The subarctic climate allows the southern part of Sakha to have taiga type of forests.

These forests have many animals and birds. There are several mountain ranges around Sakha as well. The Lena Pillars are rock structures found in Sakha. The Lena Pillars are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The region is also rich in minerals like diamond, gold, and coal. The area is also famous for its extreme temperatures. For example during winter the temperature can go to as low as and during summer as high as .

Sakha's population at the end of the Soviet Union decreased for some time according to data. It is currently increasing again. More than half of the population live in cities and towns. Most that do so live in the capital, Yakutsk. Ethnic Yakuts who are Turkic people compose of about half of the population. Russians mostly make up the other half of the population. Most people in Sakha practice Orthodox Christianity or are atheists. Certain aspects of Shamanism, which is a belief that worships spirits and nature, is still practiced by ethnic Yakuts. In recent times, more natives have shown increasing interest in practicing Shamanism. Russian is taught and used commonly in Sakha. But the Yakut language is still commonly used between different native tribes, that are not Yakuts, to talk to one another. Yakut is also taught in some schools and is also used at home.

The Olonkho is a famous Yakut tale about great people and animals. It talks about legends and present day issues like the breaking apart of Yakut families. It is only performed by experts who have learn the tale thoroughly. This is because the tale is very long. The tale is part of the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This means that the tale is widely accepted to be important and needs to prevented from being forgotten.

The Republic Day is celebrated on April 27 every year. It celebrates the formation of Yakut ASSR during the Soviet Union in 1922. The Yhyаkh festival is celebrated between 10 and 25 June every year. It is one of two New Year's Day celebrated by the Yakut people. The other being the more recognized New Year's Day in January. It is celebrated to mark the start of the short summer.

The economy of Sakha mostly relies on the mining of minerals like diamonds, gold, tin and coal. It is the region's largest producer of minerals and raw materials. Sakha also produces 99% of Russia's diamonds. This accounts for about 25% of the world's diamond output. The making of construction materials, jewellery and medicine are also major industries in Sakha. In contrast, the native Yakut people rear cattle and horses or hunt and fish to provide for themselves as well.

The Head of Sakha is the leader of the republic. The Head is chosen by public vote every five years. The Il Tumen (Legislative Assembly), is the republic's parliament. The Il Tumen are chosen similarly by the public every five years. The majority of lawmakers in the Il Tumen are currently from the United Russia party. The United Russia party is the ruling party of Russia.

Sakha lies north of the important Trans-Siberian railway and Trans-Siberian Highway. Thus there is some distance between the republic and the main travelling routes across the country. The main road link in Sakha is the Lena Highway towards the south or the Kolyma Highway towards the east. The roads can generally be passed all year round, except across the Lena River where there is no bridge. Therefore, cars have to take a ferry across the river during summer or drive on the ice in winter. The Amur-Yakutsk train line connects Sakha with the rest of the Trans-Siberian railway. The republic has several airports, including the Yakutsk International Airport. Flights from these airports link Sakha to cities further away. The usage of the Northern Sea Route to transport goods is also possible at certain times of the year.

The Settlers of Catan

The Settlers of Catan, sometimes called Catan or Settlers for short, is a board game. More than one person plays Catan at a time. The Settlers of Catan was designed by Klaus Teuber and first published in 1995 in Germany by Franckh-Kosmos Verlag (Kosmos) as Die Siedler von Catan. People play as settlers, each try to build holdings while trading and getting resources. Players get points as their settlements grow. The first player to reach a set number of points, usually 10, wins. The game and its many expansions are also published by Mayfair Games, Filosofia, Capcom, 999 Games, Κάισσα, and Devir.

"The Settlers of Catan" became one of the first German-style board games to become popular outside Europe. , more than 22 million copies in 30 languages had been sold.
The game involves a lot of strategy, while still being fairly easy to learn.

The players in the game represent settlers creating colonies on the island of Catan. Players build settlements, cities, and roads to connect them as they settle the island. The game board, which represents the island, is made out of tiles with six sides. (hexes) of different land types, which are laid out randomly at the beginning of each game. Newer editions of the game began to have a fixed layout in their manual, which has been proven by computer simulations to be fair. They recommend this to be used by beginners. In 2016, editions of the game were released with a conventional fixed layout board in this configuration. The hexes of these editions cannot be rearranged.
Teuber's original design was for a large game of exploration and development in a new land. Between 1993 and 1995 Teuber and Kosmos refined and simplified the game into its current form. Unused mechanics from that design went on to be used in Teuber's following games, "Entdecker" and "Löwenherz." The game's first expansion, "," adds the concept of exploration, and the combined game (sometimes known as "New Shores") is probably the closest game to Teuber's original intentions.

List of United States congressional districts

Congressional districts in the United States are electoral divisions for electing members of the United States House of Representatives. There are now 435 voting seats in the House of Representatives. Each seat represents around 761,000 people. There have been 435 voting seats since 1913, except for a temporary increase to 437 after the admissions of Alaska and Hawaii. The total number of state members is capped by the "Reapportionment Act of 1929". Also, each of the five inhabited U.S. territories and the federal district of Washington, D.C. sends a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives.

The Bureau of the Census counts the number of people in the United States every ten years. This is called the decennial census. The numbers from the Census are used to figure out how many representavies each state gets. This is called "apportionment". The 2012 elections were the first to be based on the congressional districts which were defined based on the 2010 United States Census.

Each state is in charge of the redistricting of districts within their state, and several states have one "at-large" division. Redistricting must take place if the number of members changes after a reapportionment, or may take place at any other time if demographics represented in a district has changed substantially. Districts may sometimes retain the same boundaries while changing their district numbers.

The following is a complete list of the 435 current congressional districts for the House of Representatives, and over 200 obsolete (no longer being used) districts, and the six current and one obsolete non-voting delegations.

Sentientism

Sentientism is a way of thinking about what is right and wrong - an ethical philosophy. It uses evidence of the real world and careful thinking to develop beliefs. It rejects beliefs where there is no good evidence for them. Sentientism says we should care about all sentient beings and care more about beings that are more sentient.

Sentient beings include anything that can experience good or bad things or feelings. These include humans, most non-human animals and may eventually include artificial beings we create or intelligent aliens we meet.

People who agree with sentientism are called sentientists. They are atheist and often humanist. They are also often vegan or vegetarian for moral reasons.

Things that are not sentient, such as plants, rivers and mountains, may be important because they affect how sentient beings feel. However, we don't need to care about them directly because they cannot suffer or feel pleasure.

Sentientist thinking has a long history, from Jeremy Bentham's An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation through to modern philosophers such as Richard D. Ryder and Peter Singer.

Sentientism differs from Speciesism because it uses degrees of sentience, rather than species, to decide what things we should care about.

Sentientism differs from painism because it counts positive experience, as well as the ability to feel pain, in making moral decisions.

Sentientism agrees with Animalism that humans are animals so we should care about both. However, sentientism argues that we should also care about non-animal sentient beings, such as potential artificial or alien intelligences.

Notable sentientists include: Thandie Newton, Bill Maher, James Cameron, Stephen Fry, George Meyer, Ricky Gervais, Sam Harris, Benjamin Spock, Oliver Sykes, Steven Pinker, Gary Holt (musician), Ellen Page, Kristen Bell, Cloris Leachman, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Richard Dawkins, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Jessica Lange and John Stewart Bell.

In some cases sentientism is implied because these people are atheists and/or humanists and vegans or vegetarians.

Spin valve

A spin valve is a device that consists of two metallic magnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic spacer whose electric resistance can change depending on the relative alignment of magnetization in the two magnetic layers, electrons moving through a non-magnetic material normally have random spins, so the net effect is cancelled out. When the magnetization of both the magnetic material are in the same direction or parallel, the resistance in the sandwiched layer becomes low so that the electrons in that layer have spins all aligned in one direction - either all up or all down, allowing a new way to store binary data in the form of one's (all spins up) and zeroes (all spins down).

Japanese dwarf flying squirrel

The Japanese dwarf flying squirrel ("Pteromys momonga") lives in forests on Honshu and Kyushu islands. They eat buds, leaves, bark and fruits. The International Union for Conservation of Nature do it as a "least-concern species".

Its body is 14–20 cm long and the tail length is 10–14 cm. It is much smaller than the Japanese giant flying squirrel. Its back is covered with grey brown hair, and its belly is white. It has large eyes and a flattened tail. Species of flying squirrels possess a patagium, which is a skin membrane used in gliding. In this particular species of flying squirrel their patagium spans between their wrists and ankles, but not between their legs and tail.

It is native to Japan where it inhabits sub-alpine forests and boreal evergreen forests on Honshu and Kyushu islands.

Japanese dwarf flying squirrels make their nests in the cavities of trees,or at the cross point between branches and tree trunks. These squirrels also tend to line their nests with mosses and lichens.Tree cavities are very important nest resources for them. They tend to nest in conifers, such as pine and spruce, more than broad-leaved trees.

It eats seeds, fruit, tree leaves, buds and bark. It can leap from tree.

Breeding form is embryonic. Birth 2 - 6 cubs in 2 times a year at a time.

Old forests and deciduous broad-leaved forests with trees for nesting are decreasing and they are divided

They also eats acorns etc. in natural forest. This habit can be compatible with forestry and coexistence with humans is possible. It is because we only need to leave some natural forests when planting cedar.

Japanese weasel

The Japanese weasel ("Mustela Itatsi") is a carnivorous mammal belonging to the family Mustelidae. It lives in Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu of Japan. Major habitats are plains, but in western Japan it mainly lives in mountainous areas.

Adult males of the Japanese weasel can reach in body length with a tail length of up to . Females are smaller. The fur is orange-brown with darker markings.

The Japanese weasel was na­tive to three of Japan’s four larger is­lands: Hon­shu, Kyushu, and Shikoku. Over the past cen­tury, they have been intro­duced to most other Japan­ese is­lands to control the population of rodents. Their range now in­cludes Hokkaidō and the many of the Ryūkyū Islands.

Japan­ese weasels are found in a lot of ecosystems in Japan. It mainly lives in moun­tain­ous and forested places near mov­ing water. Most hunt­ing is done along rivers, but these weasels sometimes go into grasslands or sub­ur­ban areas.

In win­ter, these slim weasels spend most of their time under the snow chas­ing small ro­dents through a maze of tunnels. After catch­ing and eat­ing the prey, Japan­ese weasels usually enjoy the warmth of the prey's nest after eat­ing.

They eat mice, frogs, reptiles, insects and crayfish. They sometimes eat berries, seeds and fruits but only when hungry. Males like to eat more mammals and crustacean. Females like to eat insects, fruits and earthworms.

Their diet changes depending on the season, the number of some foods. Fish and insects are a part of their diet throughout all seasons. They mostly eat coleoptera insects in spring, fruits in summer, orthoptera insects and crustaceans in autumn and fish and fruit in winter. Japanese weasels help in controlling rodent and other small animal populations.

Japanese weasels live by themselves, with the except when mating, and raising the young ones. They do not like other Japanese weasels entering their home range and will defend their home range. When scared, weasels release musk to discourage predators.

Japanese weasels are also great hunters. They chase down prey by any means, including running down tunnels, climbing trees, or swimming. Anywhere prey can go, the weasel can follow. They are both diurnal and nocturnal.

The mating season is from early May to late June. After mating, gestation takes about 30 days. The number of kits varies from 2 to 12, but is usually 5 or 6. It takes 8 weeks to fully be weaned and live by themselves. Japanese weasels are sexually mature at one year old.

Breeding season is twice a year in Kyushu, once a year in Hokkaido.

In the past century Japanese weasels have been introduced to many small Japanese islands to kill rats that were damaging crops. Together with the use of some rodenticide, the weasels helped reduce rat populations. Japanese weasels are also trapped and used in the fur trade. Japanese weasels also sometimes hunt domestic birds, such as chickens and ducks.

Although their populations are in slight decline, Japanese weasels are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List because of their widespread population across Japan. The main threat to Japanese weasels is habitat loss because of residential and commercial development.

Divide and conquer algorithm

The Divide and Conquer algorithm (also called the Divide and Conquer method) is a basis for many popular sorting algorithms. An algorithm is simply a series of steps to solve a problem. The general idea of divide and conquer is to take a problem and break it apart into smaller problems that are easier to solve. 

This idea can be seen in many popular algorithms. A helpful way to think of this idea, would be when a person looks through a dictionary. For example, if they are looking for the word “Dog”, and land on a page with the word “Firetruck”, the person knows that all the pages to the right of firetruck will not contain dog. They know this because D comes before F in the alphabet. This logic allows a person to spend less time searching, because every time they arrive on a page with the wrong letter, they know that they can eliminate the pages to their right or their left. This is an example of diving a problem up into smaller pieces. If one were to apply this concept in programming, one might start with an ordered list. If they wanted to search through that list, they would start near the center of that list. Simple logic would determine if the desired element is to the right or the left of the middle element, or in some cases it may even be the middle element. From there, each time this algorithm searches, it decreases the size of the list by half. This makes searching through the list extremely efficient.

While loop

In computer science, a while loop is a statement which is used to execute code repeatedly based on a condition. Simply, it can be thought of as a repeating if statement.  

The while loop consists of two parts: the condition and a block of code. The condition is evaluated and if it is true, the block of code is executed. This repeats until the condition evaluates to false. As a pre-test loop, the while loop checks the condition before the block is executed. In contrast, the do-while loop checks the condition "after" the loop has executed. A while loop would typically be used when you don't know the number of times you would like to loop over the block of code. Instead, code would continue looping until a particular condition is met. When the number of times a loop is to be executed is already known before the execution of the loop, a for loop would be a better choice. 

A template of a while loop is shown below:
while (condition) 

Example code in the C programming language is shown below.

int x = 0;
while (x < 5) 
In this example, the loop first checks to see if the variable x is less than 5. Because it is, it will enter the loop, printing the value of x and then increment x by 1. After completing the code block, it will continue to repeat the code block until x is equal to 5. When x is equal to five, the condition evaluates to false and the code exits the while loop. A loop that continues repeating forever is possible if the condition is always true. When this happens, it is up to the developer to create a statement to exit the loop. An example of this is shown below:  
while (true) 
In the above example, the condition while always be true. To exit the loop, a break statement is used when a specific condition inside the loop evaluates to true.

For loop

In computer science, a for-loop (or “for loop”) is used to run specified lines of code repeatedly. In different languages, there are different keywords to specify this statement—ways to identify a for loop—but they all do the same task. Most languages use either “for” or “do” as keywords.

A for-loop has two parts: a header, and a body of code. The body consists of a set of instructions (lines of code) that run for each repetition of the loop. The header often declares how many loops to complete, generally indicated by either a loop counter or a loop variable. For-loops are typically used when the number of repetitions are known. For-loops are similar to “while-loops”, but usually have a known number of repetitions.

Sample for-loop in Python:
for i in range(10):

print('Hello, world!')
This for loop prints outs "Hello, world!" ten times.

The name for-loop comes from the English word for, which is the direct translation of the earlier German "für", used by Heinz Rutishauser, who also helped define ALGOL 58 and 60.

In computer science, a loop counter is a variable that controls how many repetitions the loop will do. Usually, the loop counter variable is an integer value that increments by 1 for each completed loop. However, loop counters can also decrement, and can have step sizes other than 1. 

Loop counters change each iteration. With each repeat, there is a unique counter value. The loop counter is the deciding factor for when a loop should end and go onto the next section of code.

Common identifier names for loop counters are i, j, and k(and so on, if needed).

A for-loop is available in most common programming languages. While for-loops in different languages will all fulfill the same task, there are differences on how each programming language deals with for loops.

Boolean data type

A Boolean data type is a data type that can be either one of these two values: true or false. It was originally added to the C++ language by the ISO/ANSI(International Standards Organization/American National Standards Organization) committee in 1998. The expressions are named after the English mathematician George Boole, who formulated rules for mathematical logic. Boolean expressions also end up with a value of either true or false. Boolean expressions are used in branching and looping statements. In programming, a boolean can be used with conditional statements (statements that only happen when the right condition is met).

An example of a boolean in pseudocode:

if (Boolean_Expression)

Yes_Statement_1

Yes_Statement_Last

else

No_Statement_1

No_Statement_Last

Boolean data types can also be used with other booleans inside of conditional statements using a conjunction operator. For example: 
if (Boolean_Expression1 and Boolean_Expression2)

Yes_Statement_First

Yes_Statement_Last

else

No_Statement_First

No_Statement_Last

It can also be used with a disjunction operator:
if (Boolean_Expression1 or Boolean_Expression2)

Yes_Statement_First

Yes_Statement_Last

Canadian Eskimo Dog

The Canadian Eskimo Dog is an Arctic breed of working dog. Another name for it is "qimmiq", and it was brought to North America from Siberia by the Thule people.

Refresh rate

A refresh rate is the number of times a new image is shown on a screen (such as a television or computer monitor) per second. It is measured in hertz (Hz), which is a measurement of frequency. This means that a screen with a refresh rate of 60 Hz will show 60 images per second. The refresh rate is related to another measurement, the frame rate or frames per second (fps). In relation to a screen, the frame rate is how many images a device (such as a computer) is sending to the screen per second to be shown on the screen.

If a device is running at 30 frames per second, and the screen has a refresh rate of 60 Hz, then 30 images per second will be shown to the viewer. Even though the screen can display more images per second, it is only getting 30 images per second from the device. However, the device runs at 120 frames per second, then only 60 images per second will be shown on the screen. This is because the screen can not display more than 60 images per second (its refresh rate).

As the refresh rate of a screen increases, the amount of images shown also increases. This can make the picture shown on the screen clearer, avoiding motion blur. (Motion blur is when something moves very fast, and it looks blurry. If a screen can not show images fast enough to keep up with an object, motion blur might happen.) Many televisions and computer monitors run at 60 Hz. This is a very common refresh rate. Because 60 frames per second is a common frame rate, 60 Hz monitors can show most things very clearly. However, some people want to have a higher refresh rate, because they use things like video games or very high quality videos, which can have much higher frame rates. Many screens have 120 Hz, 144 Hz, or 240 Hz refresh rates for this reason.

Bogosort

The Bogosort is considered one of the worst sorting algorithms. It works by creating random arrangements of given values and randomly moving them until they are sorted. It is not effective for any form of sorting.

The Bogosort first takes in a set of values from a user. Next it randomly arranges these values.
If the values are now in a sorted order, then the function is finished, else the function repeats itself.

A working analogy for the Bogosort is to sort a deck of cards by throwing them into the air, picking them up at random, and repeating the process until they are sorted.


Array = (3,1 ,5 ,7 ,8 ,9)

1st shuffling = (1,3,7,8,9,5)

2nd shuffling = (3,7,8,6,9,1)

3rd shuffling = (7,6,3,8,9,1)

4th shuffling = (6,7,8,9,3,1)

5th shuffling = (3,6,7,8,9,1)

(continued shuffling) ...

The following code is done in Python 3:
import random 

def is_sorted(data): 

def bogosort(data):

Procedural animation

Procedural animation refers to rule-based or algorithmic methods of creating computer graphics animation.

With traditional animation method, principal animation poses are specified by an animator at a specific point in the animation timeline. By setting these poses, an animator can artistically direct how the geometry will be framed in some key events. These poses are in the same sense as how a person may pose for a photography session. Shapes and objects in computer graphics are considered as "geometry". With key events specified, the animation software will then automatically fill the intermediary motions between key points, thereby creating continuous motion throughout the timeline without requiring additional works by an animator.

"Procedural animation" is a rule-base approach to creating animations. These rules are typically some form of mathematical or statistical functions which tell the animation software how an object is to be animated. In order for the geometry to be animated, these functions typically require some form of time-based variable as its input. Therefore, one can apply a chain of logical rules and algorithms to create animations without manually specify any key poses.

In computer graphics, "modeling" refers to an act of digitally sculpting a model. P"rocedural modeling" then refers to same rule-based, algorithmic approach to creating geometry. Procedural modeling differs from procedural animation in that a time-based variable is not required.

Amongst some animators within the computer graphics industry, procedural modeling and animation method is also known as "proceduralism".

In order to maximize artistic impact of their craft, animators employ traditional animation techniques to set poses manually at a specific point in time. When the objects to be animated become significantly more complex, traditional animation techniques may not be feasible. Therefore, "proceduralism" offers significant advantage as complexities increase significantly. While "proceduralism" enables its practitioners to create infinite variation of models and animations, specific key pose is often left as random chance. Computer graphics animators must decide between the combinations of both techniques in order to achieve the desired outcome.

"Procedural animation" is used extensively in visual effects for movie and gaming industry where animation data and geometry must be generated with certain random probability in order to simulate the physical world.

Digital light processing

Digital light processing (DLP) projector is a kind of video projector. It uses small mirrors that reflect light. The mirrors can be moved to either reflect light or not reflect light. The mirrors move very fast. When the mirror reflects light more often, it makes a lighter color. When the mirror reflects light less often, it makes a darker color. DLP projectors can be bright and have a high resolution. This can make the picture look better. DLP projectors can be small so they can be moved more easily. Some DLP projectors are small enough to fit in a smartphone. Big DLP projectors are often used in movie theaters.

DLP projectors use a digital micromirror device (DMD) to make the picture. A DMD is made of many very small mirrors. The mirrors are in a grid on a semiconductor. Each mirror makes a small part of the picture, called a pixel. The resolution increases when the DMD has more mirrors.

The mirrors can be moved so they reflect light through the lens or reflect light somewhere else. When mirror reflects light through the lens, the pixel is light. When the mirror reflects light somewhere else, the pixel is dark. The mirrors move much faster than a person can see. When the mirror spends more time reflecting light through the lens, the pixel is lighter. When the mirror spends more time reflecting light somewhere else, the pixel is darker.

User interface design

User interface design (UI) or user interface engineering is the design of our machines and software interface such as the interface of your computer, printer, phones, etc. It helps the user interact with the system in order to increase the user experience and enhance efficiency.

Good user interface never draws useless attention and always finish the tasks first. A good format can help the user perform right interactions and a good graphic design can help the user focus on the function in the system. During the design process, we must balance the functions and visual effects to create a stable, adaptable, and functional system for users.

Interface design is applied in many different areas such as computers, to cars, to planes. Even though most of these areas have similar human interactions, we still need special skills to accomplish the design goals. That is why designers are usually specialized in some areas than others in order to make the best efforts out of themselves.

Standards of user interface design have been developed in 1980s for defining the usability of software products.

Alpha–beta pruning

Alpha-beta pruning is a Search algorithm that tries to remove options that it can take. This algorithm is commonly used for a computer to play two player games, such as chess, go, and checkers. The algorithm stops analyzing a move when it finds another possible move that is proven to be better, and that move will not be analyzed again. This algorithm is a modification of .

The algorithm keeps track of two values, Alpha and Beta, and assigns "points" to possible moves where the greater the amount of points a move has, the higher chance that choosing that move will lead to victory. Alpha represents the minimum amount of points the player the algorithm wants to win can have(the maximizing player), while beta is the maximum amount of points the algorithm wants to lose can have(the minimizing player). Alpha and Beta start as negative infinity and infinity respectively. Whenever a move is found such that the maximizing player's score improves or the minimizing player's score decreases, then Alpha and Beta will be replaced with those new values.

In the best case, the complexity of the algorithm is O(formula_1) while the worst case is O(formula_2) where b is the branching factor, that is how much each move splits into future options on average, and d is the depth, as in on average how many possible moves are made into the game.

5G

5G is the fifth generation network of cellular mobile communications, first launched in March of 2019. 5G uses many new technologies that make it faster than 4G. 5G currently can get between 100 Mbit/s and 2 Gbit/s depending on the frequency that is used. It is eventually meant to replace 4G.

There are three main groups of frequencies used by 5G:

Lowband 5G is a type of 5G that uses low frequencies, just as 4G does. Lowband 5G has long range (meaning you can be far away from a tower or inside a building and still get signal) but slower speeds than other types of 5G. Lowband 5G is only a little bit faster than the LTE (Long Term Evolution) version of 4G. Lowband 5G usually has speeds of around 100 Mbit/s.

Midband 5G is a type of 5G that uses frequencies slightly higher than lowband 5G. It has shorter range than lowband 5G, but you can usually still get service indoors using midband 5G. Midband 5G is much faster than LTE. Midband 5G usually has speeds of 600 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s.

mmWave 5G is a type of 5G that uses frequencies much higher than lowband and midband. It has very short range. With mmWave, you can't get service inside buildings. Most solid objects can block mmWave. mmWave is much faster than any other type of 5G and can reach speeds of up to 2 Gbit/s currently. mmWave is considered the least practical version of 5G since the range is so short and basically anything can block it.

4G phones do not work on 5G. To use 5G, you need a phone that supports it. Most 5G phones have "5G" at the end of the phone's name.

There are concerns from conspiracy theorists that 5G might cause cancer or COVID-19. Scientists have found these theories to not be true.

Euler's totient theorem

In number theory, Euler's totient theorem (also known as the Fermat–Euler theorem) states that if "n" and "a" are coprime, (meaning that the only number that divides "n" and "a" is 1), then the following equivalence relation holds:

where formula_2 is Euler's totient function.

Euler's theorem is a more refined theorem of Fermat's little theorem, which Pierre de Fermat had published in 1640, a hundred years prior. Fermat's theorem remained unproven until the work of 18th-century Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler.

Nikolai Yezhov

Nikolai Ivanovich Yezhov (Russian : Николай Иванович Ежов : May 1, 1895 in St Petersburg,Russian Empire – February 4,in Moscow, RSFSR, Soviet Union 1940) was the leader of the Soviet secret police called the NKVD. He worked for Joseph Stalin from 1936 to 1938, during the Great Purge. He was executed in 1940 by Stalin and Lavrentiy Beria who replaced him . Nikolai Yezhov was born on May 1 1895 in the Russian Empire either in St Petersburg,Russia,or probably Veiveriai,Marijampolė,or Kaunas in Lithuania in Imperial Russia .

He joined the Bolsheviks in April 1917, led by Lenin a few months before the October Revolution. He was known as a determined loyalist of Joseph Stalin, and in 1935 he wrote a paper in which he argued that political opposition must eventually lead to violence and terrorism; this became in part the ideological basis of the Purges. He became head of the NKVD in early 1937, after the dismissal of Genrikh Yagoda. Under Yezhov, the purges reached their height, with roughly half of the Soviet political and military establishment being exiled or shot, along with hundreds of thousands of others, suspected of disloyalty or wrecking.

Eventually, Stalin dismissed Yezhov from his post in November 1938, demoting him to the post of Commissar of Water Transport; less than a year later, Yezhov was arrested and put on trial for excesses committed during the Purges. In his defence, Yezhov said that he regretted only that he had not punished enough counter-revolutionaries. He was found guilty and probably executed in secret in 1940.

El Grito de Sunset Park

El Grito de Sunset Park () is a non-profit, volunteer-run community organization, in Sunset Park of Brooklyn, New York. Its focus is community relations with the police and aid for Puerto Rico.

El Grito de Sunset Park started in 2001 that had gathered after the Puerto Rican Parade in Manhattan, New York as an organized "cop watch" program. It took action to document the chaotic relations between police and community members. El Grito de Sunset Park officially became an organization in 2005 after acquiring a large backing by the community for its need of it. The founders are Dennis Flores, Jason del Aguila, and Noelle Flores Théard.

El Grito de Sunset Park is a small organization that consists of five members including the three founders. They are helped by volunteers that come in for special projects and for the Puerto Rican Parade every year. Members and volunteers use their phones and cameras to record police brutality and document the incidents that occur in Sunset Park to raise awareness of the oppression the community is receiving. The recording are shared on platforms and their websites to support and serve as evidence of how police officers act on duty. 

El Grito de Sunset Park is an organization that fights against oppression from the socially and economically disenfranchised system. The organization is completely volunteer run and is a non-profit organization. The group coordinates campaigns, public forums, emergency relief, speak outs, and educational programs for the community. El Grito is also in collaboration with groups with the objective to end “zero tolerance policing” in New York City. 

El Grito de Sunset Park collaborated with WITNESS to build a database where they can focus on the 72nd precinct in Brooklyn in the Sunset Park community. With the database in its infancy the project initially launched a website where videos and any facts on officers was gathered and publicly displayed. The database that was built was a tool open for the public to show the police abuse occurring in Sunset Park. Profiles were made on incidents attached to the responding officers involved and is kept up to date to this very day. The information accessible to the public was also created to help create a broader picture for the overall sentiment of the officers mainly involved in the 72 Precinct. Another scope inside this database is that a correlation of abuse and those officers’ salaries correlations were created. On such correlations the organization El Grito Sunset Park wanted to show in certain instances abusive officers were in fact getting steady inclines to their salaries and is a provocative talking point in their fightback against such tyranny. 

El Grito de Sunset Park is involved in towns throughout the island. They work in are Aguadilla, Yabucoa, Vieques, and San Juan.They reached out to help Puerto Rico when they were hit by Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria. The organization sent aid at the time of Hurricane Irma and then flew out to Puerto Rico a week after Hurricane Maria hit to provide support and assistance to the communities of Puerto Rico. El Grito de Sunset Park is involved in C"aserios Públicos" (Spanish: Public Housing)"." They work directly with Luis Lloréns Torres which is the largest public housing project in San Juan. El Grito de Sunset Park members and the community organizers of Luis Lloréns Torres worked together to provide aid and relief in mountain top communities where no aid was distributed at the time of the hurricanes. 

El Grito de Sunset Park received a donation of thirteen acres of land in a mountaintop community located in Yabucoa. They are working directly with farmers of the community to grow vegetables and fruits. They are trying to build a self sustaining model to fund the work they are doing on the island and to grow coffee. Members of El Grito de Sunset Park hope to create a space to bring young people of the diaspora back to the island to learn about the Puerto Rican culture and agriculture.

Halabja

Halabja (Kurdish: Helebce, هەڵەبجە) is a city in Iraqi Kurdistan, the capital of the Halabja Governorate. It is northeast of Baghdad.

The city is known for an incident in the final phase of the Iran-Iraq War. The Kurdish peshmerga guerrillas, supported by Iran, took control of the city. On March 16, 1988, after two days of ordinary artillery attacks, Iraqi Air Force planes dropped gas canisters on the town. The town and surrounding district were attacked with bombs, artillery fire and chemical weapons, the last of which proved most damaging. At least 5,000 people died as an immediate result of the chemical attack. It is estimated that a further 7,000 people were injured or suffered long-term illness. Most of the victims of the attack on the town of Halabja were Kurdish civilians.

The attack is believed to have included the nerve agents Tabun, Sarin and VX, as well as mustard gas. Another possibility, according to the former senior CIA analyst Stephen C. Pelletiere, is that Iraq did not have the nerve agent to use in the attack but did have mustard gas which had been used in the Iran–Iraq War. It is occasionally suggested that cyanide was also included among these chemical weapons, though this assertion has been cast into doubt, as cyanide is a natural byproduct of impure Tabun. The attack on Halabja took place amidst the Anfal campaign, in which Saddam Hussein powerfully suppressed Kurdish revolts during the Iran–Iraq War.

Before the war ended, Iraqi forces moved in on the ground and completely destroyed the town. In March 2010, the Iraqi High Criminal Court recognized the Halabja massacre as genocide. This decision was welcomed by the Kurdistan Regional Government.
