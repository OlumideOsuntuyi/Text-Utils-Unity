Giorgio Orsini descends from ancient and noble House of Orsini. Hard times had been fallen upon the House branch Giorgio belonged to. Mateo, Giorgio's father, as much as Giorgio himself, has forced to support himself and his family by manual labor. As the architect and sculptor, he was educated in the art workshop of sculptors Giovanni and Bartolomeo Buon in Venice. While in Venice, Giorgio married Elizabetta da Monte, who brought him a fair dowry, money and homes in Venice. He invested Elizabetta's money in a grocery store and in a merchant ship which brought them good returns. Elizabetta's husband entrusted her of a power of attorney by which she was able to attend to his affairs while he was absent. In July 1455 Giorgio bought home from a local nobleman Simeonich, where he engraved his family's heraldic symbol - a bear. When signing contracts, Giorgio often used his art name Georgius Dalmaticus, Sixty five years after his death, his grandson, Giacomo, an advocate by vocation, was recognized as a descendant of the noble House of Orsini. Giorgio's and Elizabetta's daughter Flavia married another Dalmatian painter, Giorgio Culinovich (Schiavone) in the year of 1463. Other source claims that the Orsinis' daughter's name was Elena (who married Schiavone).

In Venice, in 1441, Giorgio was invited to Sebenico to replace Messer Antonio di Pietro Paolo who had fallen into disrepute with the building committee of the cathedral of Sebenico. Antonio commenced the Cathedral building in 1431. Giorgio abandoned the Gothic style based ideas of his predecessor and followed revolutionary ideas of Italian Renaissance architecture, The whole cathedral building is roofed with wagon vaults, made of huge slabs of marble supported on strong transverse ribs, the same stone covering forming the ceiling inside and the roof outside. He was the chief cathedral architect from 1441 to 1473. From July 1, 1477 the work was continued by another architect, Niccolò di Giovanni da Firenze. In 1444 Giorgio went to Spalato to build the chapel of S. Ranier in the church of S. Benedetto. The work was finished in two years. He came back to Spalato in 1448 to make the chapel of S. Anastasius in the cathedral.

Orsini did not follow always the Renaissance. There are also several fine late Ancona Gothic buildings, among them the facade of S. Francesco and S. Agostino churches, the build of Palazzo Benincasa, all done by Giorgio Orsini. Work on S. Agostino facade was finished in 1455. On the S. Agostino facade, Orsini worked between 1455 and 1459. On the Loggia dei Mercanti, which was built by Giovanni Pace in 1443, the facade, with statues representing the virtues, is the work of Giorgio Orsini (1451-9) In 1460, Giorgio returned to Sebenico. In 1464 and 1465 he was at Ragusa, where he helped in building the Torre Menze, and in restoring the palace of the Rectors. The Palace of Rectors was badly damaged by the 1462 earthquake. Orsini replaced the tree central capitals, who were damaged beyond repair, of that building. The next year he was at Pago (today Pag, Croatia), improving and enlarging the courtyard of the bishop's palace. The design and work on facade of the cathedral at Ossero belongs to him, too. In the next year he undertook work on the facade of the Cappella Grande of the parish church at Pago. In 1470 he went to Rome, where his compatriot Giovanni Dalmato, the sculptor, of Trau (today Trogir, Croatia), was at work on the monument of Paul II. In 1472 he commenced the facade of S. Maria, Cittanova, in the Marche.

He had many pupils, some of whom continued to work on the cathedral at Sebenico after his death in 1475.

In Croatia, Giorgio Orsini is celebrated as a Croatian sculptor and architect, known under the Croatian name "Juraj Dalmatinac". This name is translation of his art name "Georgius Dalmaticus". The translation is coming from the second half of 19th century. Another version of the Orsini's croatised name is "Juraj Matejević". This name comes as translation of the "Georgvs Mathei" (Georg, Mathew's son) text engraved in the marble of St. Jacob cathedral church in Sebenico. Croatian author Fisković claims that "Orsini", as his family name, was never used by the artist and it was adopted by his son, after the death of his father. His claim is not supported by any documents or records dated back to the times Orsini lived and worked. Fisković's claim is defeated by the home sale contract where Giorgio Orsini was named as the home buyer. Two Italian authors recorded the use of Giorgio's family name by his son Mateo and grandson Giovanni and refuted Fiskovic
Croats erected a monument celebrating Orsini in the front of St. Jacob cathedral church in Šibenik, Croatia. This monument, an over-sized standing statue of Orsini, is a work of Yugoslav sculptor Ivan Meštrović. Two elementary schools in Croatia bear that name: one in Pag, and one in Šibenik.

Gabbro

Gabbro is a large group of dark, coarse-grained, igneous rocks. They are chemically equivalent to basalt. The rocks are plutonic, formed when molten magma is trapped under the Earth's surface and cools into a crystalline mass. 

Most of the Earth's surface has gabbro in the oceanic crust, produced by basalt magmatism at mid-ocean ridges. In general, when the gabbro is formed, it lies above the Earth's mantle, and below the basalt.

Gabbro is generally coarse grained, with crystals in the size range of 1 mm or greater. It is an essential part of the oceanic crust. Long belts of gabbro intrusions are typically formed at proto-rift zones and around ancient rift zone margins.

List of regions of Japan

The Regions of Japan are traditional subdivisions of the nation. The regional divisions are used in many ways. These include maps, geography and weather reports. Regions are used as a basic framework for description and comparison.

In Japan, the traditional regions are cultural makers. For example, according to Kunio Kishida in 1940, "The correct tradition of Japanese culture exists today not within the culture of the center, which has developed under the influence of foreign culture; but rather within regional culture."

Japan's multi-decade "Comprehensive National Development Plan" emphasizes regions in serial studies of patterns of land use and regional society.

The names of many businesses incorporate a regional name.

From north to south, the traditional regions include:

Facies

Facies is a term in geology. It means the look of a rock. If one looks up at a cliff of rock, the appearances changes from one layer to another. This because the ecological conditions changed as the rock was laid down. So, the facies reflect the process of sedimentation. 

Regular changes in the facies usually means regular changes in the ancient climate. As the climate chaged, so the sea level rose and fell. What was deep water became shallow water, and so on. In the Milankovich cycle, the climate changes regularly. As it does so, deeper water carbonates may alternate with shallow-water shales and silts. These "facies" are seen in the column of rocks.

Floorball

Floorball is an indoor team sport similar to hockey. Floorball is usually played in gyms with little plastic balls and special hockey sticks. In floorball, there are basically five players with sticks and a goalkeeper without any special equipment. The goalkeeper has only special jersey and helmet. Floorball is very popular today.

The origin of floorball is disputed, with Sweden, Canada, and the USA all claiming to have invented the sport. Regardless, floorball has been most popular in Sweden since the 1970s. Its popularity quickly spread to Finland and Switzerland, but with different rules. For example, in Switzerland a goalkeeper was allowed to use a stick. In 1986, the International Floorball Federation (IFF) was founded and rules became the same.

Floorball is played in a gym on an area of 40x20 meters bordered by boards 50 centimetres high. The formations are very similar to ice hockey. Both teams play with 3 attackers, 2 defenders and a goalkeeper. They can relieve whenever they want. Floorball is usually played 3x20 minutes with 15 minutes breaks. This is only for men and women. In juniors matches the time is different. Floorball is a contact sport so players can play with their body, but it has limits. The goalkeeper is not allowed to use a stick, but he can handle the ball with his body. The field players cannot hit the ball with their hands or head and they cannot jump. The goalkeeper can hit the ball with every part of his body and he can hold it for 3 seconds. In floorball, a player can be excluded for 2 minutes when he breaks the rules.

The currently strongest leagues are located in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Switzerland and the Czech Republic.

IFF organises world championships in floorball. Every year they are in a different country and it's also alternating between the mens and the womens tournament.

Gaslighting

Gaslighting is a slang for "making someone question their own reality".

The word also describes a person ("gaslighter") who uses words and sometimes tricks to make others unsure of what is real and what is not real. This can be very upsetting. Gaslighting is only possible when the other person is a vulnerable person, for example when the gaslighter is a powerful person or if the person being gaslighted is fearful that not believing the gaslighter will bring them grief. Sometimes, people don't know they are gaslighting others.

The term "gaslighting" comes from a play that was first performed in 1938, and which was then made into a movie in 1944. The movie was called "Gaslight", and it was a story about a husband who tries to make his wife believe that she is going crazy by constantly dimming the gas lights in their home, while telling her that they were just as bright as usual. 

Nowadays gaslighting is used to describe a type of psychological abuse where the abuser makes their victim doubt their own sanity. This manipulative abuse ranges from subtle tactics such as contradicting everything the victim says, to more aggressive tactics such as outright lies. The result is a total destruction of the victim's trust in their own ability to recognise reality.

Chatham, Kent

Chatham is a large town in Medway, North Kent. About 70,000 people live there. The town is important because of its harbour. Even though the harbour is no longer used, it is still important for tourism. The first mention of the town was in the year 1086. In the year 1667, the docks were attacked by the Dutch. Charles Dickens lived in Chatham from 1817 to 1821.

In the Chatham town centre is The Pentagon Shopping Centre as well as the Chatham Waterfront bus station and close by is Chatham railway station.

Graphics tablet

A graphics tablet is an input device for computers. Users can use them to hand-draw images, graphics or handwriting as if they were drawing on a piece of paper. They use a pointing device, most often a stylus.

Graphics tablets are one way of "digitizing" a physical piece of artwork. Instead of using hardware like scanners, one can simply trace an image from a piece of paper and it will be recreated on the screen.

Another thing that graphics tablets can do is handwriting recognition, which is popular in East Asia as a quick way to enter Chinese characters into an application.

Surface: A tablet has a flat surface on which the user can draw. This surface can be of different sizes or shapes, most often a square. Images drawn on a "graphics tablet" are most often not shown on the surface itself but can only be seen on a screen. However, there are special "graphics tablets" which allow the user to see their input right on the drawing surface. These hybrids are combination of a graphics tablet and a screen. Graphics tablets often have features like "pressure sensitivity" or "stylus hovering" that most touchscreens lack"."
Stylus: A stylus is a pen-like device that is used to give the tablet its input. It is also used to detect different amounts of pressure, often for use in a drawing program to change line thickness or color density. 

Puck: After stylus, pucks are the most commonly used tablet accessory. A puck is a mouse-like device that can detect its absolute position and rotation. Professional pucks often have a loupe for greater precision.

Passive tablets use electromagnetic induction technology. The tablet generates an electromagnetic signal, which is received by a circuit in the stylus. The wires in the tablet then change to a receiving mode and read the signal generated by the stylus to read its position. The stylus does not require a battery for this.

Active tablets use self-powered electronics that generate and send a signal to the tablet. These graphics tablets may listen for pen signals constantly, reducing inaccuracies in the reading of user input. This type of stylus often requires a battery, making it larger and heavier.

Optical tablets operate by a very small digital camera in the stylus.

Acoustic tablets are early models of "graphics tablets". A small sound generator is mounted in the stylus and the sound is picked up by two microphones placed near the surface.

Capacitive tablets work by detecting "electrostatic" or "capacitive" signals by a stylus or human. Capacitive touchscreens are most often used in smartphones and tablet computers, making them the most well known type of input device next to a computer mouse. However, these are rarely used in graphics tablets as the lack of precision and many other features make them less useful. 

Because a stylus can be used to measure pressure, tilting and other factors, it is useful for use in digital art (especially two dimensional). These factors can be used to change brush size, opacity, shape, color and more in certain graphic programs depending on the input. Graphics tablets are often used for technical drawing and computer-aided design as well as for digital drawing, graphic design, sketches and much more.

They are also used for online teaching, e.g. live tutorials or lessons where visual information is needed. Some users prefer tablet computers for some purposes, though those devices often lack sensors for pressure and tilt.

When it comes to buying a drawing tablet, you have two options either you can buy a drawing tablet with screen or one without screen. Drawing tablets with screen are way costlier than screenless tablets.


Patrick Murphy (giant)

Patrick Murphy (1834–1862) was an Irish giant, born in County Down from parents James Murphy and mother Peggy (née Cunningham), who put himself in a show as a way of making money. He originally worked on the docks in Liverpool, England and, after that, became a waiter at a hotel. Because he was so tall, Murphy attracted crowds everywhere he went. He eventually decided that he could make a living being tall. He always spoke of himself as being 8'10" and in some circles as much as 9'3". In about 1860, he was measured by a Dr. Virchow as being 7'3.4" (222 cm) tall.

In May 1857 the Emperor and Empress of Austria invited the tall Irishman to visit their kingdom. While he was on tour throughout Europe, he died of smallpox in Marseille at the age of twenty-eight.

Gigantism

Gigantism, also known as giantism, is a condition when growth and height are much above average. Overactivity of growth hormone during childhood causes this condition in humans. The growth hormone is one of the hormones that is released from the interior pituitary gland. If a person has been exposed to very high level of growth hormones before their growth plates have merged during childhood for example, this can be lead to the condition of gigantism.

Murphy decided to help the rebels by using his plane to bomb the government-controlled town of Naco, Sonora. He tried many times between March 31 and April 6 to bomb Naco but also accidentally, bombed the Arizona border town with the same name. He destroyed some buildings and a car. United States soldiers eventually came to his house and took away his plane. Murphy escaped to rebel territory in Mexico but returned to the United States and was jailed for a little while.

Murphy became the first person working for another country to ever bomb the mainland United States. Singer Dolan Ellis honored Murphy in one of his songs on his "Tall Tales, Lost Trails & Heroes" album.

The comic language has many puns and allusions. The words are spoken in a fast, rushed manner. The comedy is a kind of banter. 

According to Canadian crosstalk comedian Dashan (Mark Rowswell), the closest equivalent in English would be Abbott and Costello's "Who's on First?" sketch.

Oppidum

An oppidum (plural: "oppida") is a large fortified Iron Age settlement. 

In the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, they were in all parts of Europe. They continued until the Romans conquered Southern and Western Europe. In Germania, north of the rivers Danube and Rhine, oppida were used into the 1st century AD.

Julius Caesar called the larger Celtic Iron Age settlements he found in Gaul "oppida". The word is now used to describe the large pre-Roman towns that existed across Western and Central Europe. Many oppida grew from hill forts, but not all of them had an important defensive role. The main features of the oppida are:

The development of oppida was an important step in the urbanisation of Europe. They were the first large settlements north of the Mediterranean that could be described as towns. Caesar pointed out that each tribe of Gaul would have several oppida, but that they were not all of equal importance. This suggests that there was some form of hierarchy.

In conquered lands, the Romans took over the oppida to administer the Empire, and many became full Roman towns. This often involved a change of location from the hilltop into the plain.

One of the best preserved oppida is at Enserune in France. It was occupied continuously from 6th century BC until the 1st century. Other oppida are now buried beneath large cities, such as Vindobona which is covered by Vienna.

Mandarin oranges are usually eaten plain or in fruit salads. The mandarin is tender, and is damaged easily by cold. It can be grown in tropical and subtropical areas.

Mandarin oranges contain many nutrients but is highest in vitamin C and calcium. A medium mandarin contains approximately 22 grams of vitamin C and 31 grams of calcium.

The mandarin is easily peeled with the fingers, and can be easily split into even segments without squirting juice. This makes it more convenient to eat, as utensils are not required to peel or cut the fruit. Mandarin segments are also sold in cans.

During Chinese New Year, Mandarin oranges and tangerines are considered traditional symbols of good fortune. During the two-week celebration, they are frequently displayed as decoration and presented as gifts to friends, relatives, and business partners.

Thermal expansion

In physics, thermal expansion is the likelihood of matter to change in volume in response to a change in temperature. When a substance is heated, its basic particles move around more quickly and by doing so generally maintain a greater average separation. Materials that contract with an increase in temperature are very uncommon; this effect is limited in size, and only occurs within limited temperature ranges. The degree of expansion divided by the change in temperature is called the material's coefficient of thermal expansion and generally varies with temperature. 

Thermometers are an example of using thermal expansion. They contain a liquid which can only move in one direction (along the tube) when volume changes along with temperature.

Thermal expansion can become a problem for trains because it can cause the rails to buckle. On the rails they will have monitors so that if it does get abnormally high in temperature they can be warned and trains could be told to slow down to reduce the heat of friction. Sometimes on the inner parts of the rails they will be painted white to reflect the sun's hot rays so that it won't cause buckling.

Algal bloom

An algal bloom is an accumulation of algae (typically microscopic) or a rapid increase in their amount in a body of water. Algal blooms may occur in fresh water as well as salt water. Algal bloom concentrations may reach millions of cells per milliliter of water. Algal blooms are often green, but they can also be other colors such as yellow-brown or red, depending on the species of algae. So-called algal blooms are often caused by Cyanobacteria such as "Aphanizomenon flosaquae", which are no longer considered to be algae. Some kinds of algal blooms, such as red tides, are poisonous.
Algal blooms are often caused by eutrophication. Eutrophication occurs when abnormal amount of nutrients, especially phosphorous and nitrogen, enter a body of water. Algal blooms are a big problem to ecosystems because, like any sudden unnatural growth, it harms the other animals in that ecosystem, usually decreasing their numbers quickly. The abundance of algae in algal blooms causes layers of algae that are unable to get sunlight, and this causes the algae to die and start to decompose. The top layers of algae is able to photosynthesize and continue living. The lack of nutrients and dissolved oxygen in the water inhibits other life. Fish become unable to breathe and other aquatic vegetation cannot photosynthesize. All the organisms in the water start to die and decompose. The decomposition of the dead organisms use up most of the remaining dissolved oxygen in the water. Without a sufficient amount of nutrients and dissolved oxygen all living organisms in the water die which leads to a dead zone.

Smoky Hill Chalk

The Smoky Hill Chalk is an Upper Cretaceous conservation Lagerstätte, or fossil-rich geological formation. It is known for its exceptionally well-preserved marine reptiles from the Western Inland Sea. 

The Smoky Hill Chalk outcrops in parts of northwest Kansas, its most famous localities for fossils, and in southeastern Nebraska.

Many of the most well-known specimens of the marine reptiles were collected by dinosaur hunter Charles H. Sternberg and his son George. The son collected a unique fossil of the giant bony fish "Xiphactinus audax" with the skeleton of another bony fish, "Gillicus arcuatus" inside the larger one. Another excellent skeleton of "Xiphactinus audax" was collected by Edward Drinker Cope during the late nineteenth century heyday of American paleontology.

Army men

Army men, or plastic soldiers, are simple toy soldiers molded from green or other colored plastic. Unlike the toy soldiers, which cost more, army men are sold at low prices in discount stores, supermarkets, and dollar stores. Also, unlike many toy soldiers, army men are sold unpainted and almost always dressed in modern military uniforms and armed with 20th Century weapons.

Army men are sold in plastic bags or buckets and often include colors such as green, tan, or gray to represent different sides. They have a lot of different kinds of weapons, from World War II to the current era. These include rifles, machine guns, submachine guns, sniper rifles, pistols, grenades, flamethrowers, and bazookas. They may also have radio men, minesweepers, and men armed with bayonets. Army men are sometimes packaged with additional accessories including tanks, jeeps, half tracks, artillery, helicopters, jets, and buildings. Their vehicles are usually manufactured in the same size to save money.

The first American plastic toy soldiers were made by Bergen Toy & Novelty Co. (Beton for short) in 1938. 

Samuel Morse

Samuel Finley Breese Morse (April 27, 1791 – April 2, 1872) was an American inventor. He was the first person to make a telegraph with only one wire, and also helped come up with the idea of Morse code.

Since the 1700s, there were different types of telegraphs being made, but they were hard to use because they had several wires. (The first telegraph ever built had 26 wires, which made it almost impossible to use.) Morse spent years trying to build one with only one wire, and managed to do it in 1836. Morse and his assistant made a code with "dots and "dashes", which were two different types of "clicks" on the telegraph.

Morse's invention made it possible to quickly communicate with people far away, and many telegraph lines were built. A telegraph line using his invention was built between Washington, D.C. and Baltimore in 1844. By the 1860s, there were telegraph lines all around North America, and in 1866, a telegraph line was built across the Atlantic Ocean.

Samuel F. B. Morse was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts

Morse was a painter before he was an inventor. He was a professor of art at New York University. He wanted to do some paintings that were going to be done at the United States Capitol, but was not chosen to do them. He was so disappointed that he gave up painting.

Morse was a devout Christian. The first message he sent on his 1844 telegraph line was "What hath God wrought?", which comes from the Book of Numbers in the Bible.

He died in New York City on April 2, 1872.

Ryan Stiles

Ryan Lee Stiles (born April 22, 1959) is an American actor, comedian, director, and voice actor whose work is often paired with improvisational comedy. He is best known for his improv and co-production work on the American and British versions of "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" and the role of Lewis Kiniski on "The Drew Carey Show". He played Herb Melnick on the CBS comedy "Two and a Half Men" and was a performer on the show "Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza".

Stiles was born in Seattle, Washington, the youngest of five children. His father, Sonny, was a fishing plant supervisor. Stiles lived in Vancouver, British Columbia as a teenager. At the age of seventeen, he dropped out of his high school, Richmond Secondary, to have a career in comedy. He worked in his father's fish-processing plant to earn a living. He then began performing improv with Vancouver TheatreSports League. In 1986, Stiles successfully auditioned for a berth at Toronto's renowned Second City comedy ensemble.

By 1989, the producers of the comedy show, "Whose Line Is It Anyway?", noticed his work. Stiles was a regular guest on the show until 1998, and the show's short production season allowed him to make numerous television and motion picture appearances in the United States.

In 1995, Stiles was asked by American comic Drew Carey to be a regular on his comedy "The Drew Carey Show". Stiles played Drew's smart but under best friend, Lewis Kiniski. Stiles' first line in the first episode of the show, "And that's why the French don't wash," is a line he had used in an episode of the British version of "Whose Line?".

In 1998, Carey successfully got ABC to get an American version of "Whose Line?" produced. Following the final season of the British version in 1998, the American version premiered, with both Stiles and Carey as executive producers. Stiles and Colin Mochrie were the only two actors to appear in every episode of the US version, though Wayne Brady also became a regular near the beginning of the second season. The series was produced until 2006.

Stiles was the most iconic performer on the original UK version of "Whose Line?", appearing in 76 of the series 136 episodes (including compilations). He first appeared in the fifth episode of the second season, which aired in late 1988. He appeared in one other episode of that season, before returning for four episodes of the third season. His prominence increased with each season, including appearances in every episode of Season 4 which was filmed in New York; ultimately appearing in every episode from the seventh season onwards.

Stiles was known for several recurring impressions he performed on the shows, performed both at his own decision and as an assignment in games. These included Carol Channing, Elvis Presley, John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Steve Irwin and Christopher Lloyd's character in "Taxi", Jim Ignatowski. He made clear his dislike of the musical segments of the show at every opportunity whenever he was chosen to perform in them, mostly because of his inability to form lyrics quickly. In particular, he disliked the games Hoedown and Irish Drinking Song, often reacting negatively (or sarcastically positively) to its being announced. Other than in early UK playings, Stiles was always the last performer to sing in Hoedown and other similar musical games, allowing him more time to devise lyrics, and giving him the final punch-lines, as well as injecting (usually not-so subtle) jabs at the Hoedown itself, or of the host for having him perform in it.

Stiles had first met Colin Mochrie years before while performing stand-up. They first performed together in Vancouver TheaterSports then in Second City, Toronto.There were a number of games which paired Mochrie and Stiles at every playing. Though other performers did so, he was the most common performer to make bald jokes at Mochrie. In return, Mochrie often made jokes about Stiles's height, nose, attractiveness, and tendency to wear exotic, flamboyant shoes, which were designed by George Esquivel. However, he would sometimes stand up to or make jokes at the other performers (including Drew Carey) who made fun of Mochrie's baldness or Mochrie in general, mostly during Scenes From A Hat.

Stiles received a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program in 2002 for his work on the show.

In 1981, Stiles met Patricia McDonald at Punchlines where she was waitressing. They lived together for seven years before marrying in 1988. They have three children: Sam, Mackenzie, and Claire. When not working in Hollywood, he lives at his home on Lake Sammamish, outside Bellingham, Washington, where he has opened the Upfront Theatre, a small theatre dedicated to live improv comedy.

Stiles once lived in a house previously owned by Liberace in Sherman Oaks, California, but he sold it.

Stiles appeared in the 1991 film "Hot Shots" as Mailman Farnham, and also starred in the 1993 sequel (follow-up) "Hot Shots! Part Deux", as marine Rabinowitz.

Since 2004, Stiles has been seen as the reappearing character Dr. Herb Melnick in several episodes of the comedy "Two and a Half Men" which stars his "Hot Shots" co-star Jon Cryer and formerly Charlie Sheen. Stiles also made short guest appearances on "Murphy Brown", "Mad About You", "Mad TV", and "Dharma & Greg". In July 2008, he was a guest star on "Reno 911!" as Sergeant Clift, an acting coach.

During the 1994 Major League Baseball strike Stiles appeared in several commercials for Nike, hanging out in an empty ballpark doing things such as playing the organ and attempting to do the wave alone. The commercials ended with the tag line: "Play ball. Please."

The village currently has about 740 inhabitants and consists of five parts - Ratibořské Hory, Vresce, Dub, Podoli and Ratiborice. There already begins Moravian Highlands with the occurrence of minerals and ores containing silver.

In 1526 King Louis Jagelonsky granted brothers Medencum of Ratiborice and Podoli right to extract minerals in a half miles in circumference around Ratiborice. The king reserved the preferential right to purchase precious metals, gold and lot for two stacks and talent of silver for three and a half stack.

This privilege started extensive mining activity area Ratiborice, which enriched the local landscape of picturesque islands heaps especially with forest vegetation. It is these heaps, vivid evidence of mining, are a wonderful adornment of the landscape, we can observe the dominant height, from Adam's Hill, whose summit is at an altitude of 611 meters, or from the top of the loaf, which is above the natural park Polanka and its altitude is 666 m.

Canoe racing

Canoe racing is a water sport. The sport normally takes place on water that is moving very slowly or not moving at all. The goal of the sport is to move the canoe a given distance in the shortest time. This sport is an Olympic event. At one time, wooden boats were used for racing. Over time, people started using boats made of carbon fibers. These boats are lighter and tougher than wooden boats.
There are two main types of races. These are canoe (C1, C2, C4) and kayak (K1, K2, K4). The number tells how many people are on the boat. In a kayak, a person sits. In a canoe, a person kneels on one knee. A kayak has a rudder. It is used to steer the boat. A canoeist (person who uses a canoe) uses the paddle to move the boat. This is done by moving the paddle from the bow to the stern (front to back). After each race, the boats are looked at to make certain they are legal. If a boat does not have enough weight, the racer is disqualified and cannot win the race.

Races are divided into several groups based on how long they are.
In short distance races, the races are either 200 m, 500 m or 1000 m long. The path of the race is laid out using buoys. Each person has a separate path to follow from the starting line to the finish. On longer races, there may be a point where the paths cross each other to let the person turn their boat.

Long distance races are 5000 m long. Marathon races are at least 15 km. Men's marathon has a minimum length of 20 km. Women's marathon has a minimum of 15 km. Most major races are 30 km or longer. There is no maximum distance for marathon races. There is a marathon race that is about 1000 km long on in the Yukon. The longer races are usually broken up into several parts and may be raced over several days. In long distance and marathon races, all racers start at the same time. They do not use "intervals" where the racers are started at different times.

Geocaching

Geocaching is an outdoor sport activity based on GPS (Global Positioning System). Players use a receiver or mobile device and other navigational techniques to hide or look for containers, called "geocaches" or "caches".

One of the main ideas of geocaching is putting caches in places that are interesting, but not often visited by tourists. In the listing of the cache, information about the places is given.

After 19 years of activity there are over 3,000,000 active geocaches. There are over 5 million geocachers worldwide.

Geocaching was invented shortly after the removal of artificial error from GPS on May 2, 2000. Accuracy of the GPS before this date was about 100m, after this date is less than 3m. Improved accuracy allowed geocachers to specify where caches are located.

The first cache was placed on May 3, 2000, by Dave Ulmer in Beavercreek. It was found by Mike Teague of Vancouver on May 6, 2000. The original name of the game is "GPS Stash Hunt", but it was changed on May 30, 2000 after the discussion of several players to "Geocaching". 

The cache is usually in a waterproof plastic container with a logbook where geocachers write their registered nickname and date they find it. Larger containers usually contain items for trading like plastic toys, hockey cards or special trackable items called Travel Bugs or Geocoins. Trackable items are logged on the website and moved from cache to cache.

The coordinates of a hidden cache with the rating of the difficulty and terrain and information about size are placed by owner at the official website Geocaching.com. After checking by a reviewer, they are published and available for other gteocachers.

Traditional cache: The basic cache type, hidden on the place defined by coordinates in header of listing.

Multi cache: The geocacher usually has to go over the stages, find some information at every stage (such as number on information board etc.) and at the finish calculate the coordinates of the final cache.

Mystery/puzzle cache (also called "Unknown cache"): The coordinates of the final cache are usually hidden in some cipher, image or text and the geocacher has to discover it.

Letterbox hybrid cache: A combination of geocaching and letterboxing in the same container. Instead of a classic cache there is a stamp, which the finder can print to his or her diary.

Webcam cache: It is not a typical cache where the geocacher has to find a hidden box with a logbook. Instead, he has to find a webcam on the published coordinates and take a photo of himself.

Virtual cache: Similar to webcam cache, there is no hidden box at the coordinates. The geocacher only has to find out information such as the name on a monument and send it to the owner of the cache.

Earth cache: Very similar to virtual cache, but in a geographically interesting place. The geocacher has to find out answers for the questions in a listing, take a photo here, and send it to the owner of the cache.

Event cache: Meeting organized and attended by geocachers. There is also special type of event – CITO (Cache in, trash out), where geocachers have to clean up an area. An event attended by more than 500 people is called a Mega-event, and an event attended by more than 5000 people is called a Giga-event

Cardinal-nephew

A cardinal-nephew (; ;) was a pope's relative -- a nephew -- who was raised to the rank of cardinal. The practice of creating cardinal-nephews originated in the Middle Ages.

Cardinal-nephew was an office in the Curia of the Roman Catholic Church before 1692. After the death of the reigning pope, the office of cardinal-nephew was vacated. 

The pope's cardinal-nephew was his chief assistant and confident. The man in this role was expected to act as if he were a relative of the pope; and sometimes -- often, he was in fact a member of the pope's extended family. 

After 1692, this office was banned by Pope Innocent XII in "Romanum decet pontificem." 

This role and function is now filled by the Vatican's Secretary of State.

Notable cardinal-nephews include many who would later become popes:

El Cid

Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar (about 1043 – 1099 AD), known as El Cid, was a Castilian nobleman. He was a military leader in medieval Spain. After his death, he became the hero in a mediaeval Spanish poem, "El Cantar de mio Cid".

Exiled from the court, El Cid went on to command a Moorish force. After the Christian defeat, El Cid was recalled to service. He took command of a combined Christian and Moorish army. He used this army to create his own fiefdom in Valencia. He was a brave general that lead his country to victory. El Cid was born in Vivar, also known as Castillona de Bivar. The Muslims gave him the nickname "El Cid" from the Spanish Arabic word al-sid, meaning "lord." 

El Cid was brought up at the court of King Ferdinand the Great and served Ferdinand's son, Sancho II of León and Castile. He rose to become the commander and royal standard-bearer of Castile when Sancho became king in 1065. 

Sancho wanted to reunite all the three parts of his dead father's kingdom. Rodrigo lead the Castilian military campaigns against Sancho's brothers, Alfonso VI of León and García II of Galicia, as well as in the Muslim kingdoms in Al-Andalus. Sancho was murdered in 1072. 

After his brother's death, Alfonso returned from exile attempting to claim his dead brothers throne. El Cid then swore Alfonso to the throne and named him King.

Although, Alfonso feared that El Cid would not prove loyal, but with no proof. In 1074, El Cid married Alfonso's niece, Jimena. Some believe the marriage was encouraged by Alfonso to bring El Cid under his watchful eye. Alfonso never gave El Cid a chance to make a better name for himself in the military, and kept him from becoming famous. 

El Cid soon became fed up, and in 1081, without Alfonso's permission, he invaded the city of Toledo.

This made Alfonso very mad, and his advisors told him that El Cid had tried to betray him by attacking the city without his permission, false information. Alfonso then banished him from the Kingdom of Castile. 

El Cid then worked as a paid, professional soldier for the Muslim king of Saragossa. During the time that had past, El Cid defeated Christian attacks and continued to make himself better known and more famous as a general. This caused other kings and generals to fear that El Cid would overtake them with his power.

In October 1086, Alfonso had a battle with the Almoravids. They attacked each other at Sagrajas, where Alfonso was defeated. The loss made Alfonso reconsider banishing El Cid. Alfonso called him back, hoping El Cid could defeat the Almoravids. However, the trust issues led the two men to go their separate ways yet again. The Alfonso and El Cid were meet together with their armies, but they failed to because of miscommunication. People convinced King Alfonso that El Cid had planned to not show up, and let Alfonso and his army be defeated. Once again, Alfonso exiled El Cid.
El Cid and his small army left, and invaded land in eastern Spain. Four years later, he ruled a large, wealthy territory. Its capital was Valencia.

He ruled well, allowing Muslims and Christians to mingle. King Alfonso begged for El Cid’s help in his ongoing battle with the Almoravids. Meanwhile, the kingdom El Cid had worked so hard to build was falling apart from Muslim revolts. El Cid went back to Valencia and returned the city to peace.

El Cid continued to conquer many cities before his death on July 10, 1099 in Valencia. El Cid's life story inspired many playwrights and poems.

She starred as Dorothy Stratten in "Star 80" (1983), a movie about the "Playboy" model's life and murder. Reports circulated for years that Hemingway had had her breasts enlarged to play the role of Stratten. During a 2007 appearance on the late-night talk and variety show, "Fashionably Late with Stacy London", she said she had the surgery before "Star 80". Her breast implants were removed years later after they had ruptured.

Hemingway has played a lesbian or bisexual woman in several movies and television shows, including, "Personal Best", "The Sex Monster", "In Her Line of Fire", and episodes of the TV series "Roseanne" and "Crossing Jordan". Hemingway, however, is not gay. She has said she formed a "big connection with the gay-and-lesbian community" after "Personal Best" and enjoys taking roles in "cutting-edge" productions.

Hemingway has a perfume, "Mariel", by HO+.

She is the host of "Spiritual Cinema", a monthly television show dedicated to spiritual movies. She has begun hosting a series of yoga practice videos "Yoga Now", with guru Rodney Yee.

In December 2008, Hemingway said through her web site's blog that she had separated from her husband earlier in the year. Hemingway had been married since December 9, 1984 to Stephen Crisman. They had two daughters together: model Dree Hemingway (born 1987) and Langley Fox Hemingway (born 1989). As of early 2011, Hemingway is romantically involved with Bobby Williams.

Mariel Hemingway is the author of:

James Black

Sir James Whyte Black, OM, FRS, FRSE, FRCP (14 June 1924 – 22 March 2010) was a Scottish doctor and pharmacologist. Black started in the physiology department at the University of Glasgow. While there, he became interested in how adrenaline affected the human heart. He went to work for ICI Pharmaceuticals in 1958. While working for ICI, he created propranolol. Propranolol is a beta blocker, used to treat heart disease. Black also created cimetidine. It is a drug used to treat stomach ulcers. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1988 for creating these drugs.

Black was born in Uddingston, Lanarkshire. He was the fourth of five sons of a Baptist family. His father was a mining engineer. He grew up in Fife. Black went to Beath High School, Cowdenbeath. At the age of 15, he won a scholarship to the University of St Andrews. At St Andrews, he studied medicine. He graduated in 1946.

After graduating he joined the Physiology department at University College as an Assistant Lecturer. He later took a lecturer position at the University of Malaya. Black had decided against a career as a medical practitioner as he objected to what he perceived as the insensitive treatment of patients at the time.

After graduation, Black took a teaching job in Singapore for three years. He moved to London in 1950. Later in 1950, he returned to Scotland. He joined the University of Glasgow (Veterinarian School). There that he became interesteed in how adrenaline affects the human heart. He was mainly interesting in how it affected people with angina. He found the effects of adrenaline did not help. He joined ICI Pharmaceuticals in 1958. He worked with the company until 1964. During this time, he created propranolol, which became the world's best-selling drug. While at ICI, Black developed a new way of doing research. Before this, drug molecules would be created and then tested to find in what ways the molecules could be used as medicine. Black chose to pick a medical use and then try to create the molecules for that medicine. The discovery of propranolol was said to be the greatest discovery in the treatment of heart disease since the discovery of digitalis.

At the same time, Black was trying to find a treatment for stomach ulcers. ICI did not wish to do this so Black stopped working for them in 1964. He joined Smith, Kline and French. He worked for them for nine years until 1973. While there, Black developed his second major drug, cimetidine. It was first sold under the brand name Tagamet in 1975. Tagamet soon outsold propranolol to become the world's largest-selling prescription drug.

Black became the department head of pharmacology at University College London in 1973. He created a new undergraduate course in medicinal chemistry. He had many problems trying to get money for research, so he quit. He went to work for Wellcome Research Laboratories in 1978. He worked there until 1984. Black then became Professor of Analytical Pharmacology at the Rayne Institute of King's College London medical school. He stayed there until 1992. He created the James Black Foundation in 1988 with money from Johnson and Johnson. He worked with 25 scientists in drugs research. This research included gastrin inhibitors which may stop some stomach cancers.

Black helped increase basic scientific and clinical knowledge in cardiology. His creation of propranolol is thought to be one of the most important contributions to clinical medicine and pharmacology of the 20th century. Propranolol has helped millions of people.

Black was made a Knight Bachelor on 10 February 1981 for services to medical research. He received the honour from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. On 26 May 2000 he was appointed to the Order of Merit by the Queen.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1976. That same year he was awarded the Lasker award. In 1979, he was awarded the Artois-Baillet Latour Health Prize. In 1982 Black was awarded the Wolf Prize in Medicine. He was awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings for their work on drug development. In 1994 he received the Ellison-Cliffe Medal from the Royal Society of Medicine.

Digital electronics

Digital electronics is a type of electronics. These make use of "boolean logic" and "discrete digital signals" for electronics, devices, and equipment. 

Examples of such devices are computers, information appliances, digital cameras, digital televisions, flash memory, key USB memory, mobile phones, hard disks, and devices of computer memory. Digital signal processing works on analog signals after they have been converted to digital form.

Digital electronics is a branch of electronics concerning digital circuits which apply boolean logic which are represented by electronic logic gates. True and false are represented by different binary values with 0 volts for true and 5 volts for false. Digital circuits are less vulnerable to noise but consume a lot of energy. Digital circuits were invented in the twentieth century and is the foundation for digital communications and computers.

Semi-trailer truck

A semi-trailer truck, also known as a semi, tractor-trailer, big rig, eighteen-wheeler, or (in the United Kingdom and Ireland) articulated lorry or artic is a vehicle that includes a tractor unit for towing and a semi-trailer for carrying freight or passengers. Some of them use diesel fuel.

A semi-tractor has no body and does not carry any cargo on it. The front of a semi-trailer is put on it. Only the rear of the trailers have wheels, so the tractor pulls the trailer and carries the front part of the trailer's weight.

The tractor and driver cost as much as a truck, but the trailers don't cost very much. You can have more trailers than tractors and the tractors can change trailers easily. The tractor and driver do not have to wait to be loaded or unloaded, they can change trailers. They can also pull different kinds of trailers, any type that is needed at the time.

All countries have different laws for semi-trucks. The biggest difference between the EU, UK, and US is the length of the semi-truck. Most weigh about the same (US trucks weigh a little less than EU and UK trucks). Most are about the same width and height. In large countries truck s can be longer. They can have a larger cargo space. Longer semi-tractors drive better at faster speeds. Most US trucks are "convential" (bonneted in UK) with the engine under a hood in front of the cab. In the US shorter trucks weigh less. The weight has to be spread out over a long length. This is important on bridges. With long semi-trucks not as many trucks fit on the bridge and the weight of the axles are far apart. This length is important in the US.
In the UK and EU roads are smaller and turn more. Trucks have to be shorter. Most are cab-over-engine models (COE). The driver sits over the engine and the front of the cab is flat. Shorter trucks can weigh more. Trailers can have three axles under the load, and short semi-tractors with two axles. These have the same weight and number of axles as a long semi-truck. They take up less space and can turn better.

Different countries drive on different sides of the road. This is named for the side the driver sits on. The UK is the main right-hand drive (RHD) country. Most countries that were British colonies are RHD. The EU and most other countries are LHD. The US was British but is LHD. Canada (next to the US) is LHD. When you are building a truck LHD or RHD is not important. Australia builds US type Mack and International trucks with RHD.

Semi-trailers can be the same types as trucks, because they do not cost as much as a truck they can also be special types. Shipping containers are large and heavy. In some countries special laws cover them. Skeleton frame trailers are built to carry them. Long semi-trailers are used for logs. In the U.K. and E.U., some logs are smaller. The trailers are 2 or 3 logs long. They have a crane to load them. In the U.S. "lowboys" (the load is just above the road) carry large construction machines. Special trailers can be built for very big loads. Australian road trains can consist of 4 trailers.

Interstate 470 (Ohio – West Virginia)

Interstate 470 (I-470) is a long loop of Interstate 70. It goes around the city of Wheeling, West Virginia. The western end of the road is where it meets I-70 near Blaine, Ohio. Traveling southeast through Belmont County, the highway comes to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge which carries I-470 over the Ohio River. After crossing the river into Ohio County, West Virginia, the highway turns northeast. It runs towards the Wheeling neighborhood of Elm Grove. The road's eastern end is at I-70 near Wheeling Park.

On average, between 26,000 and 38,000 vehicles use the highway every day. During the rebuilding work on the Wheeling Tunnel, I-470 was one of two suggested detour routes to avoid the closed tunnel.


Video camera

A video camera is camera used to make electronic motion pictures. It captures moving images and synchronous sound. Early video cameras were all analog and most modern ones are digital. Analog video cameras produce signals that can be displayed with analog televisions. The signals can be shown at the time, or can be stored in an analog format on magnetic tape. Digital video cameras produce digital images.

Video cameras were invented early in the 20th century for television use, and by the end of the century, people could buy digital video cameras, which can almost immediately display the image. Video recorders that could record the image on magnetic tape were created in the middle 20th century.

At first, video cameras were large and expensive. Only professionals operated them. As the electronics industry advanced, and solid state circuits with transistors and microprocessors replaced vacuum tubes, video cameras became smaller and inexpensive. Now many mobile phones and other consumer electronic devices include video cameras. In addition, software is now widely available to edit or to compress the output from video cameras.

Modern video cameras have numerous designs and uses, not all of which resemble the early television cameras. 

Special uses of video cameras include systems that capture images at the finish line to time races and sporting events. Some toll roads use video cameras to make pictures of the license plate of any car that fails to pay tolls. Computers then identify the drivers and mail enforcement letters to collect the missed tolls.

Pope Innocent VI

Pope Innocent VI (; c. 1282 – September 12, 1362), born Étienne Aubert, was a French cleric of the Roman Catholic Church and the 200th Pope from December 18, 1352 until his death in 1362.

He was the fifth of the seven popes who lived in Avignon in France.

Étienne Aubert was born in the hamlet of Les Monts, which is today part of the commune of Beyssac in the Corrèze department of France. He was the son of Adhemar Aubert (1260-?), seigneur de Montel-De-Gelas in Limousin.

Aubert was made the Bishop of Noyon in 1338; and he became the Bishop of Clermont in 1340.

In 1342, he was raised to the position of cardinal.

Cardinal Aubert was elected pope on December 18, 1352. He chose to be called Innocent VI.

Pope Innocent was involved in Italian and European political disputes.


The tomb of Innocent VI is at the Carthusian monastery of Villeneuve-les-Avignon.

Stress analysis

Stress analysis is the study of stresses and strains in materials and structures as force is applied against them. It is a topic in engineering. Stress may cause deformation or fractures in materials. Stress analysis is about finding out how much stress causes deformation in a given material.

Stress analysis is an important task for civil, mechanical and aerospace engineers. They work on the design of structures of all sizes, such as bridges and dams, machines, and even plastic cutlery and staples. Stress analysis is also used in the maintenance of such structures, and to investigate the causes of structural failures.

Azerbaijani Armed Forces

The Azerbaijani Armed Forces () is the military of the Republic of Azerbaijan.

The armed forces have three branches: the Azerbaijani Land Force, the Azerbaijani Air Force, and the Azerbaijani Navy. Related forces which are not part of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces, include the paramilitary Azerbaijani National Guard, the Internal Troops of Azerbaijan, and the State Border Service of Azerbaijan (who patrol Azerbaijan’s borders with Georgia, Russia, Iran, Turkey and Armenia), which can be involved in state defense.

The Commander-in-Chief of the military is the President of Azerbaijan, currently Ilham Aliyev. The Ministry of Defense is in charge of politicalleadership. It is currently headed by Safar Abiyev. Military command is in the hands of the General Staff, headed by the Chief of Staff, who is Colonel-General Najmaddin Sadigov. 

Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan has been trying to further develop its armed forces into a professional, well trained, and mobile military. Based on 2007 statistics the country has about 66,940 troops, and a paramilitary force of 15,000 troops. There are 300,000 former service personnel who have had military service in the last fifteen years. 

Azerbaijan had actually established the Azerbaijani Armed Forces and a Ministry of Defense on June 26, 1918 with the first independence of Azerbaijan, as the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, after the collpase of the Russian Empire in 1918 until it was invaded and annexed by the Soviet Union in 1920 which came after the Russian Empire. The Azerbaijani Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defense were established again in 1991 with the second and final independence of Azerbaijan, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the Azerbaijani Armed Forces were formed out of the former Soviet forces in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic.



Azerbaijani Land Force

The Azerbaijani Land Force () is the army of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces which is the military of the Republic of Azerbaijan.

Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan has been trying to further develop its armed forces into a professional, well trained, and mobile military. Based on 2007 statistics the country has about 56,840 ground force (land) troops, and a paramilitary force of 15,000 troops. There are 300,000 former service personnel who have had military service in the last fifteen years. 

In wartime, the Army proper could call the support of the paramilitary Azerbaijani National Guard, the Internal Troops of Azerbaijan, and the State Border Service of Azerbaijan (who patrol Azerbaijan's borders with Georgia, Russia, Iran, Turkey and Armenia), which can be involved in state defense. The exact wartime command structure is unknown.

Azerbaijan has also sent soldiers to be trained in Turkey, Russia and Israel over the past years, and these countries also sell weapons to Azerbaijan, among many countries. Since the end of the Nagorno-Karabakh War, Azerbaijan has made the army boost the defense of the country and possibly retake its separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh from neighboring enemy Armenia which invaded it, but is legally a part of Azerbaijan.



Azerbaijani Air Force

The Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force often called the Azerbaijani Air Force () is the air force and air defence force of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces.

The origin of the current organization goes back to June 26, 1918, when the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic which became independent in 1918, after the collapse of the Russian Empire, bought its first fighter aircraft. After the second independence of Azerbaijan in 1991, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the presence of former Soviet air bases in Azerbaijan helped the Air and Air Defence Force develop.

The Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force has about 600 aircraft and 350 helicopters, and 7,900 personnel. There are Soviet-made MiG-21s, MiG-23s, Su-24s and Su-25s, as well as fourth generation MiG-29s bought from Ukraine in 2006 and Soviet-made Il-76s. Azerbaijan is holding talks with either China or Pakistan to buy JF-17 Thunder aircraft. The MiG-29 has been chosen as the standard aircraft for the Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force.




Azerbaijani Navy

The Azerbaijan Navy () is the navy of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces operating in the Caspian Sea.

The origin of the current organization goes back to June 26, 1918, when the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic which became independent in 1918, after the collapse of the Russian Empire, formed its first navy. After the second independence of Azerbaijan in 1991, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Azerbaijani Navy was formed out of the former Soviet Navy in the Azerbaijani SSR.

The navy has about 5,000 military personnel in sixteen units. These include the Caspian Sea fleet and a border coast guard.

Aggression

Aggression refers to behavior between members of the same species that is intended to cause humiliation, pain, or harm.

Ferguson and Beaver defined aggressive behavior as ""Behavior which is intended to increase the social dominance of the organism relative to the dominance position of other organisms"”

Aggression takes a variety of forms among humans and can be physical, mental, or verbal.

There are two types of aggression - hostile, affective aggression and instrumental, predatory, or goal-oriented aggression.

Reactive relational aggression (hostile, affective, retaliatory) is used in response to feeling attacked, threatened, or mad. Usually the person who shows this type of aggression feels provoked to do so. Instrumental relational aggression (predatory, goal-oriented) is used in order for an individual to get what they want.

Predatory or defensive behavior between members of different species is not normally considered as "aggression."

Like most, or even all behaviors, aggression can be examined in terms of its ability to help an animal reproduce and survive. Animals may use aggression to gain and secure territories, as well as other resources including food, water, and mating opportunities.

The most apparent type of aggression is that seen in the interaction between a predator and its prey. An animal defending itself against a predator becomes aggressive in order to survive and predator in order to secure food. Because aggression against a much larger enemy or group of enemies would be nearly certain to lead to the death of an animal, animals have developed a good sense of when they are outnumbered. This ability to gauge the strength of other animals gives animals a "fight or flight" response to predators; depending on how strong they gauge the predator to be, animals will either become aggressive or flee.

Although humans share aspects of aggression with non-human animals, they differ from most of them in the complexity of their aggression because of factors such as culture, morals, and social situations.

Aggression is a behavior where one harms another individual intentionally. Over the years, there has been an ongoing debate on the origin or causes of aggression among humans. Some theories argue that aggression is innate, while others contend it is a learned behavior.


Kuni-kyō

, also called Kuni no miyako, was an ancient Imperial capital of Japan between 740 and 744. It was in present-day Kizugawa in Kyoto Prefecture. 

The new capital of Emperor Shōmu was built by Tachibana no Moroe.

The palace ("Kuni no miya") was built in the former Yamashiro Province. in what became the town Kizu. 

The city of Kuni-kyō was not completed. The court and capital moved to Naniwa-kyō (Osaka) after only four years.

Studies of the archaeological site suggest the location of the main buildings. The city was laid out in a grid. The area of palace is estimated to have been 500+ meters wide and 700+ meters long.

Focal length

The focal length tells how strongly a lens, a curved mirror or another optical device brings light together or spreads it out. If rays of light go straight into a lens and the focal length is positive, the focal length is the distance to the point behind the lens where the rays will be brought to a focus. If the focal length of the lens is negative, the focal length is the distance at which the light has spread to twice its original size. Light from a large distance produces an image at F (focal point). The distance from the centre of the lens to F is the focal length.

Sribhargavaraghaviyam

Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam () (2002), meaning "Of Parashurama and Rama", is a Sanskrit epic poem (Mahākāvya) made by Jagadguru Rambhadracharya (1950–) in 2002. It is made of 2121 verses in 40 Sanskrit and Prakrit metres and is separated into 21 cantos ("Sarga"s) and each contains 101 verses. The epic is the story of the two Rama Avatars – Parashurama and Rama. This is found in the Ramayana and other Hindu books. "Bhārgava" is used for Parashurama, as he was born in the family of the religious teacher Maharishi Bhrigu, while "Rāghava" is used for to Rama as he was born in the royal family of king Raghu.

Protein Data Bank

The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a collection of information about the three dimensional (3-D) structure of large biological molecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids. Biologists and biochemists from around the world send in the data. Most data comes from X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. Anyone can access the PDB for free online. The Worldwide Protein Data Bank, wwPDB, manages the PDB.

The PDB is useful for scientists studying structural biology and structural genomics. Many scientists have to send their information to the database. Major scientific journals and some funding agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health in the United States have rules telling scientists to send the data to the PDB. The PDB has the original or primary data. Hundreds of other databases reuse the data. These secondary databases organize the information in different ways. For example, both SCOP and CATH put structures into groups organized by type of structure and ideas about how they are related through evolution. Gene ontology puts the data into groups based on genes.

Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic

The Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (Azerbaijani: "Азәрбајҹан Совет Сосиалист РеспубликасыAzərbaycan Sovet Sosialist Respublikası"; Russian: Азербайджанская Советская Социалистическая Республика [АзССР] "Azerbaydzhanskaya Sovetskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Respublika [AzSSR]"), also known as the Azerbaijan SSR for short, was one of the republics that made up the former Soviet Union.

It was founded on April 28, 1920 as the Azerbaijan SSR. From March 12, 1922 to December 5, 1936, it was part of the Transcaucasian SFSR together with the Armenian SSR and the Georgian SSR. In December 1922, the Transcaucasian SFSR became part of the newly established Soviet Union.

On November 19, 1990, the Azerbaijan SSR was renamed the "Republic of Azerbaijan" while still a part of the Soviet Union for another year before its collapse and the independence of Azerbaijan in 1991.

Plitvice Lakes

Plitvice Lakes is a World Heritage Site and National Park in Croatia. 
Waters flowing over the limestone and chalk have deposited minerals, and created natural dams. The result is a series of beautiful lakes, caves and waterfalls. The forests in the park are home to bears, wolves and many rare birds.

Plitvice is the oldest national park in southeast Europe and the largest national park in Croatia. It was founded in 1949 and is in the mountainous karst area of central Croatia, at the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In 1979, Plitvice Lakes was one of the first natural sites added to the UNESCO World Heritage register. Each year, more than 900,000 visitors are recorded.

The lakes are renowned for their distinctive colours, ranging from azure to green, grey or blue. The colours change constantly depending on the quantity of minerals or organisms in the water and the angle of sunlight.

The area includes forests, meadows and water plants; ecologically it ranges from Alpine to Mediterranean conditions. Of over 1,000 types of plant, 75 are endemic, found naturally only here, and 55 are species of orchids.

The park is home to a wide variety of animal and bird species. Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, capercaillie and many bats are there, with many more common species. 
157 species of birds have been recorded, 70 of which nest in the area. 12 amphibian species and lizards, snakes and turtles are there also.

Jats

Jat(Jadgal), Jutt or Jaat is a community of traditionally non elite peasants in northern India and Pakistan.

Jats had its origins in pastoralism in the lower Indus valley of Sindh until they were forced northwards due to the Islamic conquests.

Many Jat people serve in the Indian Army, including the Jat Regiment, Sikh Regiment, Rajputana Rifles and the Grenadiers, where they have won many of the highest military awards for gallantry and bravery. Jat people also serve in the Pakistan Army especially in the Punjab Regiment.

Jaats inhabited throughout the Punjab region, Sindh and some other northwestern parts of Subcontinent.

Some but not all sapotes come from the family Sapotaceae:




Hansel and Gretel

"Hansel and Gretel" () is a fairy tale from Germany. The Brothers Grimm heard it from Dortchen Wild in Cassel and published it in their "Children's and Household Tales" in 1812. The Grimms revised the tale over the years. They gave the children names, changed the mother to a stepmother, and introduced Christian motifs. Their final version is dated 1857. The tale has been adapted to many media, most notably the opera "Hänsel und Gretel" (1893) by Engelbert Humperdinck. A stop-motion animated movie based on the opera was made in the 1950s.

Hansel and Gretel are a young brother and sister who learn their parents intend to abandon them in the forest. Despite their situation, Hansel and Gretel’s spirits remained high.They find their way home by leaving a trail of pebbles. One day, however, their parents succeed. The children wander the forest and come upon a house made of cake and candy. It belongs to an old woman who makes the children prisoners. Although, she intends to eat them, she fails. Gretel outwits her. She pushes the old woman into the oven and slams the door. The two poor kids escaped and lived happily ever after.


Hurricane Hattie

Hurricane Hattie was a very powerful and deadly Atlantic storm in the western Caribbean Sea in autumn 1961. The storm struck Belize and parts of nearby countries, killing more than 300. This hurricane, because of how strong it was, would have been a Category Five on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The name Hattie was later retired.

Singapore at the Olympics

Singapore has sent athletes to most Summer Olympic Games held since 1948. The country was created as a separate British Crown Colony from the Straits Settlements about three months before the start of the 1948 Summer Olympics. It sent a team to the Games until 1964. 

At that time, Singapore was part of Malaysia. The team from Malaysia included people from Singapore. When Singapore became independent from Malaysia in 1965, the country began sending its own team again. It sent a team for every summer games after then, except in 1980. The country boycotted the 1980 games along with many other countries. No athletes from Singapore have been in any Winter Olympic Games.

The country has won four Olympic medals. The first medal was won by Tan Howe Liang, who won a silver medal in lightweight weightlifting in 1960. In table tennis, Jing Jun Hong and Li Jiawei came close to winning medals in Sydney in 2000. They finished in fourth place. They also finished fourth in the 2004 Athens Olympics. Singapore sent many athletes to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. It was felt that this was their best chance of winning a medal since 1960. This proved to be true.

In the Beijing, Li, together with Feng Tianwei and Wang Yuegu, beat the South Korea Women's Table Tennis team in the semi-finals. Because of this, they made it to the final match and would win at least the silver medal. Singapore lost to host China in the gold medal final.



Philip Showalter Hench

Philip Showalter Hench (February 28, 1896 – March 30, 1965) was an American physician. Hench won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1950. He won the award along with his Mayo Clinic co-worker Edward Calvin Kendall and Swiss chemist Tadeus Reichstein . They won it for finding the hormone cortisone and its use for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis."

Hench went to university at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. He was trained as a physician at the United States Army Medical Corps and the University of Pittsburgh. Hench began working at Mayo Clinic in 1923. He later became the head of the Department of Rheumatology.

He attended Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. At Lafayette, he earned his Bachelor of Arts in 1916. After that, he served in the Medical Corps of the U.S. Army and the reserve corps to finish his medical training. He got a doctorate in medicine from the University of Pittsburgh in 1920. After getting his medical degree, Hench spent a year as an intern at St. Francis Hospital in Pittsburgh. Next, he became a Fellow of the Mayo Foundation.

In 1928 and 1929, Hench studied at Freiburg University and the von Müller Clinic in Munich.

Hench started his career at Mayo Clinic in 1923. He worked in the Department of Rheumatic Diseases. In 1926, he became the head of the department. While at Mayo Clinic, Hench worked mainly on arthritic diseases. This lead him to believe that steroids lessened the pain caused by the disease. During this time, biochemist Edward Calvin Kendall has found several steroids created by the adrenal gland cortex. After several years of work, Hench and Kendall decided to use one of these steroids on patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Testing of the hypothesis was delayed because the synthesis of Compound E was costly and time-consuming, and Hench served in the military during World War II. The tests were conducted successfully in 1948 and 1949. The steroid they used was named Compound E at the time. It later become known as cortisone.

Hench, Kendall and Swiss chemist Tadeus Reichstein won the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for their discoveries relating to the hormones of the adrenal cortex, their structure and biological effects." As of the 2010 prizes, Hench and Kendall are the only two Nobel winners who worked with Mayo Clinic. 
During his career, Hench was one of the founding members of the American Rheumatism Association. He was its president in 1940 and 1941. 

Hench also got the Heberdeen Medal (1942), the Lasker Award (1949), the Passano Foundation Award (1950), and the Criss Award. Lafayette College, Washington and Jefferson College, Western Reserve University, the National University of Ireland and the University of Pittsburgh gave Hench honorary doctorates.

Kaštanka

Kaštanka is a forest. It has one of the highest lying sets of chestnuts in central Europe. It is in a small town called Nasavrky. Nasavrky is in eastern Bohemia, Czech Republic. It is about 25 km south of county seat Pardubice. 

Jan Adam von Auersperg came back from Italy with six seedlings of chestnut at the end of 18th century. He ordered that the seedlings were planted on the north side of Nasavrky hill. This happened between 1776 to 1778. The plants were the start of Kaštanka. In passing time, the set was expanded a lot. Kaštanka had over 110 trees in the turn of 19th and 20th century.
Kaštanka was made a nature monument on 1 December 1990. At that time, Kaštanka had over 138 trees. One of the first planted trees survives to this day. It was named "Knížák" in honor of prince Auersperg.
The chestnut became the sign of Nasavrky. It became the main motive in the emblem of the city Nasavrky, and the flag of Nasavrlky in 1996.

Kaštanka is natural monument which was declared as special protection area on 1st December 1990. The set of chestnuts is on a slight rise north ward. This area is in a built-up area about 100 meters from the city square. Kaštanka is at an altitude of 472 – 486. The area of set is 1,088 hectares large and all trees are chestnut trees expect a few that are on the edge.

Kaštanka was main theme of many artists like painters, sculptors and writers. Some writers wrote novels about Kaštanka. Two of the authors that did this were Marie Doležalová and Alois Stanislav Novák. Kaštanka gave Věra Vovsová, Jiří Poláček and Karel Pavlík the inspiration to make art. Vovsová said this about Kaštanka:

Patty Duke

In 1963, at age 16, Duke won the Academy Award for "Best Actress in a Supporting Role" for playing Helen Keller in "The Miracle Worker". At the time, she was the youngest person to win the award. 

On March 29, 2016, Duke died of sepsis from a ruptured intestine in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. She was 69 years old.

Prequel

Prequel is a term in drama and literature: it is a fusion of the words 'precursor' and 'sequel'. 

When a story is told in several stages, it is natural to tell it in order of time. For example, a series of books on the Second World War started with the 1930s and ended up in 1946. 

For various reasons, this does not always happen. In the movie series "Star Wars", the first movie was "" (1977). It was followed by three prequels, which were "" (1999); "" (2002) and "" (2005).

For correct use, the term 'prequel' is only applied when work is part of a series, and when the later publication refers to an earlier time. It is an old idea, but one which is often used today for drama on movie and television. The "Cypria", a work of Ancient Greek literature, is a prequel to Homer's "Iliad". A related idea is the back-story, which is the background story of a main story or character.

Talking past each other

Talking past each other is an idiom.

The phrase describes a situation in which people communicate at cross purposes.

The idiom explains what happens when there is a mismatch. Idioms are a common stumbling block for learners of a language.

The idiom applies to disputes in which neither side addressed any of the issues raised by the other. In talking past each other, two different concepts which need not have been disputed are somehow confused or conflated.

In fictional dialogue, when characters talk past each other, the result is an exchange with flaws or defects.

The phrase is used in many contexts. For example,



Viveiro

Viveiro (sometimes called Vivero) is a town and municipality. It is in the province of Lugo. Lugo is in the northwestern part of Galicia, Spain. As of 2010, over 16,000 people live in Viveiro.

The calendar of Viveiro holds several festivals, both religious and not.

Viveiro has the oldest Carnival in Galicia. It is celebrated during the four days before Lent, from Saturday until Shrove Tuesday. It finishes on Tuesday with many floats travelling through the streets.

Viveiro celebrates the St. James' Day Battle on July 25 at the Port of Celeiro. It has marines moving through the estuary of Viveiro in a well organised and orderly way, similar to a march.



Blind men and an elephant

The Blind men and an elephant is an idiom.

The story of the blind men and an elephant comes from India. It is about a range of truths and mistakes. It is also about the need for communication and the need for respect for different perspectives. 

The idiom shows the effects of observation and bias. Idioms are a common stumbling block for learners of a language.

A group of blind men (or men in the dark) touch an elephant to learn what it is like. Each one feels a different part, but only one part. For example, one touches only the side and another touches only the tusk. 

The blind men discover that they disagree when each describes what he has learned from touching the elephant.

A famous poem — "The Blind Men and the Elephant" by John Godfrey Saxe (1816–1887).

The poem begins:
It was six men of Indostan
To learning much inclined,
Who went to see the Elephant
(Though all of them were blind),
That each by observation
Might satisfy his mind

They conclude that the elephant is like a wall, snake, spear, tree, fan or rope, depending upon where they touch. None of blind men's description is correct for the whole elephant.



Internal Troops of Azerbaijan

The Internal Troops of Azerbaijan () also known as Interior Troops or Interior Guard is the uniformed gendarmerie-like paramilitary force in Azerbaijan.

The Internal Troops are under the authority of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, who also control the police. The Internal Troops are the descended from the Soviet Union's Internal Troops. They are used to deal with internal emergencies such as natural disasters, restoring public order, internal armed conflicts and to protect important facilities. During wartime, the Internal Troops fall under the jurisdiction of the Azerbaijani Land Forces, and can be involved in local defense and security of the country, along with the army.

Its equipment includes Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine guns.

Other law enforcement bodies in Azerbaijan include the Azerbaijani National Guard and the State Border Service of Azerbaijan and its Coast Guard branch.



Kaskaskia, Illinois

Kaskaskia is a village in Randolph County, Illinois, United States. In 2020 the population was only 21, making it the third-smallest incorporated community in Illinois. It was a major French colonial town of the Illinois Country. Its peak population was about 7,000 when it was a regional center. Kaskaskia became the capital of the Illinois Territory on February 3, 1809. In 1818, Illinois became the 21st U.S. state and Kaskaskia was its capital until 1819. 

In April 1881, the Mississippi River moved its path to the east. This flooded most of the town. The river now passes east rather than west of the town. The state boundary line, however, remained in its original location. Kaskaskia is on a small part of Illinois west of the river. It can only be reached from Missouri.

The town was named after the Native American word for the Kaskaskia River. The site of Kaskaskia had been a Native American village for thousands of years. In 1703 French Jesuit missionaries started a mission. They wanted to change the Illini (Native American) people's religion to Catholicism. The first stone church was built in 1714. The French also had a fur trading post at the village. French settlers came to farm and mine lead on the Missouri side of the river. In 1718 Kaskaskia became the capital of Upper Louisiana and a fort, Fort de Chartres,was built.
From its beginning, Kaskaskia was a French/Indian settlement, with a few French men and many Illinois and other Native Americans. In 1707, the population was about 2,200. Most were Illinois, who lived somewhat apart from the Europeans. From the French, the Native Americans, and their mixed-race descendants at Kaskaskia came the voyageurs and coureurs des bois. They explored and hunted in the Missouri River country. The French wanted to trade with all the Prairie tribes, and with the Spanish colony in New Mexico. This idea horrified the Spanish. The explorer Claude Charles Du Tisne set up trade relations with the Plains Indians in 1719.

King Louis XV sent a bell to Kaskaskia in 1741 for its church. During French rule, Kaskaskia and the other farming settlements in the Illinois Country were important for supplying Lower Louisiana, especially New Orleans, with wheat and corn. Farmers sent tons of flour south over the years. These staple crops could not grow in Louisiana's climate.

In 1733, the French built Fort Kaskaskia. The British destroyed the fort in 1763 during the French and Indian War. After the war France gave up the territory east of the river. Many French-speaking people from Kaskaskia and other colonial towns moved west of the Mississippi to the Spanish-held, Upper Louisiana settlements of Ste. Genevieve, St. Louis, and other areas.

On July 4 1778, during the American Revolution, the city was captured by George Rogers Clark and his force of 200 men including Captain Leonard Helm. It was one of the western-most battles of the Revolution. The parish rang the church bell in celebration, which has since been called the "liberty bell". The bell is housed in a brick building near the Church of the Immaculate Conception. The brick church was built in 1843 in the squared-off French style.

As a center of the regional economy, Kaskaskia was the capital of Illinois Territory from 1809 until Illinois became a state in 1818. Zaskaskia continued as the state capital until 1819. Its peak population was about 7,000 before the capital moved in 1819 to Vandalia. Although introduction of steamboats on the Mississippi River helped the economies of river towns in the 19th century, their use also had devastating environmental effects. Loss of trees (Deforestation) along the river banks was caused by steamboat crews' cutting trees to feed the engine fires. River banks became unstable and collapsed into the water.

At first, the town had a good site where the Kaskaskia and Mississippi Rivers joined. But from St. Louis to the junction of the Ohio River, the Mississippi became wider and more shallow, with more severe flooding. Much of Kaskaskia and other French colonial towns have been lost through flooding and erosion. Following the Great Flood of 1844, Kaskaskia was rebuilt to the south. The original site became an island, surrounded by the Mississippi River. The flood of 1881 destroyed the original town, and the Mississippi shifted into the channel of the Kaskaskia River, passing east instead of west of the town. Parts of the town were rebuilt in the new area.

As the Mississippi continued to flow through its new bed, earth was deposited so that the village became physically attached to the west bank of the river, which is in the state of Missouri. Now a bayou, the old river bed, is regularly flooded. It has a bridge to carry traffic over it. In 1893, the people of the town moved and rebuilt the Church of the Immaculate Conception on Kaskaskia Island.

By 1950 only 112 people lived in Kaskaskia. By 1970 the population had fallen to 79, and it continued to fall to 33 in 1980. The town was flooded with nine feet of water by the Great Flood of 1993, which reached the roofs of the buildings. By 2000, with a only nine residents, Kaskaskia was almost a ghost town and the least populous incorporated community in the State of Illinois.

Kaskaskia is located at .
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total land area of 0.2809 km² (0.1085 sq mi, or 69.41 acres), all land. However, the village is only a small part of Kaskaskia Precinct, which includes all of Randolph County's land west of the Mississippi. Kaskaskia Precinct has a land area of 24.037 square miles (62.255 km²) and a 2020 census population of 31 persons. In 1993 the Mississippi River almost completely flooded the island.



Windsor, Vermont

Windsor is a town in Windsor County, Vermont, United States. It is built on the banks of the Connecticut River. The population was 2,066 at the 2010 census. The Constitution of Vermont was written and signed in the town. It is known as the birthplace of Vermont. It was the first capital until 1805. Then Montpelier became the official capital.

The first settler in Windsor was Captain Steele Smith who arrived with his family in August 1764. The Constitution of Vermont was written and signed in 1777 at a tavern, now called Old Constitution House. This constitution declared that Vermont was an independent republic, and no longer part of the British Empire. By 1820, Windsor was the largest town in Vermont. It had factories making guns, machinery, tinware, furniture and harness. A dam built across Mill Brook in 1836 provided water power for these factories.

Psychopathy

Psychopathy is a personality disorder or antisocial personality disorder. Psychopaths are unemotional. They do not show concern about the feelings or rights of others. They show almost no empathy, and do not try to conform to social norms. They lack a conscience and do not feel guilt. A similar term is sociopathy.

Many psychopaths are charming and often manage to have superficial ties with other people. They use other people for their own benefit. Psychopaths often show other antisocial behaviour as well, including sadism, violence and deception. They are very selfish and discard people whom they have no further use for. They may have many children by many partners.

The definition of psychopathy has varied. Different definitions are used. They only partly overlap and sometimes seem contradictory.

There are efforts to use behaviour therapy to treat psychopaths; often, this may be done in prisons.

Some people are mislabeled as "psychopaths", but have no problems with social norms, but they are good at influencing people. There is a difference between the sexes as to how psychopathy is shown. Men show it more more as an antisocial pattern of behaviour. In women it shows more as a histrionic pattern (excessive attention-seeking).

Amongst professional psychiatrists, psychopathy is known for being difficult to treat.

Map projection

A map projection is a way of showing the surface of a three-dimensional sphere on a flat surface. Such projections are necessary to create maps. The problem with projections is that they change the surface in some way; this is called distortion. Depending on the purpose of the map, some distortions may be less bad. This is why cartographers use different mathematical projections for different maps.

Carl Friedrich Gauss showed that is not possible to project the surface of a sphere to a plane, without distorting it. This theorem is known as Theorema egregium today.

To understand the projections, it is easier to imagine a light source, a globe, and another geometric object. The light source shines "a shadow" of each point of the globe onto the geometric object.

Road Town

Road Town, on Tortola, is the capital of the British Virgin Islands. It is next to the horseshoe-shaped Road Harbour in the centre of the island's south coast. About 9,400 people lived there in 2004.

The name comes from sailing. "The roads" means a place less sheltered than a harbor but where ships stop. Its marina made Road Town a popular place in the Caribbean for chartering yachts. Cruise ships often dock here. Road Town also has tourism.

The Harbour is the dock for many of the ferries servicing the island. The ferry terminal is at the southwest end of Road Town. Ferries run during the day every day of the week. A 28 hectare (70 acre) development called Wickham's Cay, is on two areas of man-made land. The HM Prison on Main Street is the oldest building in Road Town. It was built in the 1840s. People disagree about where the borders of the town are.

The Emancipation Proclamation was read on 1 August 1834. This gave slaves their freedom, even though slavery had been officially abolished in 1807.

In 1853, a fire destroyed nearly every building in Road Town. Angry rioters spread the fire to protest an increase on the cattle tax. Rioters burned most of the plantations across the island.

Couvade

Couvade (French, from "couver", 'to hatch', from Latin "cubare" 'lie down) describes the imitation of a pregnancy. It is performed by a man. The anthropologist E. B. Tylor was the first person that made use of the name "couvade". 

To do so, the father carries out the same restrictions as the mother. These usually start closer towards the end of the pregnancy. It often proceeds for various amounts of time after childbirth. Restrictions: certain food taboos, staying only in the village or at home, avoiding certain places, no consumption of alcohol, cigarettes or stimulants or handling with sharp instruments. In some cases, the man copies the woman’s behaviour and pains during childbirth.

The couvade is known throughout history, for example in the ancient Greece and the Roman Empire, in the Basque Country and in the south of France. These days, it still exists in various cultures around the world among indigenous people in India, Thailand, Indonesia, China, Africa, North America and South America.

These range from the spiritual and physical protection of the child, bonding of father with child as well as wife, the public recognition of fatherhood and support and relief of mother so she can maintain the household after the childbirth. The reasons for couvade are in some cultures linked to certain myths that give instructions and show what can go wrong if the parents do not follow them. 

It is believed to have huge impacts on the child such as illness, disability, death and the transformation into other creatures.

Corydon, Indiana

Corydon is a town in Harrison Township, Harrison County, Indiana, United States. It was founded in 1808. Corydon was the second capital of the Indiana Territory, from May 1, 1813, until December 11, 1816. When Indiana became a US state in 1816, Corydon became Indiana's first state capital. On January 10, 1825 the capital moved to Indianapolis. The town remains the county seat of Harrison County. It had a population of 3,153 at the 2020 census.

Corydon was part of the land captured for the United States by George Rogers Clark from the British during the American Revolution.

In the early 1800s, Edward Smith and his family settled on the site of today's county fairgrounds. William Henry Harrison, Governor of the Indiana Territory, often stopped to rest at their home while travelling to and from Vincennes. Harrison decided to build a town there and asked Edward Smith's daughter, Jenny, to name it. She chose the name "Corydon" from Harrison's favorite hymn, the Pastoral Elegy.

Harrison sold the town site to Harvey Heth in 1808, a government surveyor and large landowner. Heth donated the town square for public use, and sold individual lots to settlers and the government. In 1809, Corydon was joined by road to Doup's Ferry, 15 miles (24 km) to the south in Mauck's Port. This gave access to the Ohio River for trade. Corydon sent a mounted militia company company nicknamed the Yellow Jackets to support the US army in the War of 1812. They fought in the Battle of Tippecanoe.

Corydon, Madison and Jeffersonville all wanted to be the new capital of the territory, but Corydon was more central to the population of the newly reorganized Indiana Territory. Corydon became the second capital of the Indiana Territory on May 1, 1813, when it was moved there from Vincennes. When Indiana became the 19th US state on 11 December 1816, Corydon became the state capital of Indiana. The first state capitol building made using limestone from a nearby quarry, was built from 1814-1816. The Governor's Mansion and First State Office Building were built in 1817. The Grand Masonic Lodge, the first in the state, was built in 1819.

The state's first constitution was written in Corydon during June 1816. The 43 delegates, representing Indiana Territory's counties, met in the Harrison County Courthouse. Because of cramped conditions inside the courthouse and the summer heat, they often met outside under a giant elm tree next to Big Indian Creek. This tree is now known as the Constitution Elm, and its trunk is still preserved.

Dennis Pennington, the speaker of territorial legislature and others from Harrison County in the Indiana General Assembly did not want to move the capital from Corydon. They added a clause to the state constitution during the convention preventing the capital from leaving the town before 1825. But as the population of the state shifted continually northward, it was no longer convenient to have a state capital at the southern edge of the state. The capital was finally moved to Indianapolis on January 10, 1825.

Corydon was the site of the only Civil War battle fought in Indiana. On July 9, 1863, Confederate cavalry led by Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan, and citizens of Brandenburg, Kentucky, crossed the Ohio River into Indiana. This became known as "Morgan's Raid". Morgan's 2,500 men were opposed by 400 hastily assembled home guard at the Battle of Corydon. The Union troops were quickly defeated and the town surrendered. Corydon was sacked in retaliation for Union looting in Kentucky. The town's treasury of $690 was seized, and prisoners in the jail were released. Morgan demanded from $600 to $700 from each mill and shop owner; otherwise their buildings would be burned. Tradition says one Corydon miller overpaid by $200; Morgan promptly returned it to him.

The railroad reached Corydon in 1882. Corydon was connected by Southern Railways to the main line running across northern Harrison County at Crandall. The line remained open to passenger traffic until 1996. In 2008, the line was owned by Lucas Oil.

In 1929, the county built a new courthouse to replace the old state capitol building. The old statehouse was converted into an historical memorial.

The Old Capitol Building is now a state historic site and the downtown area became a National Historic District in 1973. The Governor's Headquarters, Constitution Elm, First State Office Building and Posey House are also part of the historic area. The O'Bannon Publishing Company prints the "Corydon Democrat"', a weekly newspaper. Indiana Governor Frank O'Bannon owned the publishing company and his wife still lives nearby.

Corydon is located at (38.212724, -86.125318).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.6 square miles (4.1 km²), all land.

Matsudaira Sadanobu

Sadanobu was born in Edo on January 15, 1759, into the Tayasu branch of the Tokugawa clan. The Tayasu was one of the "gosankyō". The Tayasu were the oldest members of the Shogun's family who still had the name Tokugawa. The other members of the family had the Matsudaira surname.

His father was Tayasu Munetake and he was the grandson of the eighth shogun Tokugawa Yoshimune. The Tayasu house held different beliefs than the others living in Edo Castle. They lived a lifestyle that was more strict. The Tayasu following the example set by Yoshimune. In Munetake's words, the praise of manly spirit ("masuraoburi") as opposed to feminine spirit ("taoyameburi"). This set them apart from the rest of the family. Munetake thought he would rule after his father died. This did not happen. Yoshimune's eldest son, Ieshige became ruler. Because of this, Sadanobu was raised under the belief that he would be the next heir to the title of Shogun. His education growing up was very good. He was taught along Confucian lines. By the time Sadanobu was in his teens, he had already learned much of the teachings of Confucius. As he grew older, many expected more strongly for Sadanobu do well because many members of the Tayasu house began to die young. The family tried many ways to make Sadanobu as the next shogun. Their attempts were stopped by the political clique of Tanuma Okitsugu. Okitsugu was the chief rōjū at that time.

After the last failed try to get Sadanobu adopted by the shogun, Sadanobu was adopted by Matsudaira Sadakuni. Sadakuni was head of one of the Hisamatsu-Matsudaira houses. This was another part of the Tokugawa branch of the family. They ruled the Shirakawa Domain in southern (Mutsu Province.

Sandanobu took control of Shirakawa in 1783. As soon as he took control he had to deal with a very bad problem. The lands he controlled were said to be worth 110,000 "koku". 1 Koku was the amount of rice needed to feed one person for one year. The land should have been able to create enough rice to feed 110,000 people for a year. But 108,600 Koku was said to be "lost". Sadanobu worked constantly to fix the economic problem in Shirakawa. He work fixed the problems of the finances and economy of the lands. The changes he made, along with his political workings made him very famous. Because of this, he was named chief councilor of the Shogunate in the summer of 1787. He was also made regent to the 11th shogun Tokugawa Ienari early the next year.

Sadanobu was also known as a writer. He wrote using the pen name "Rakuō" (楽翁). Some of his notable texts include "Uge no Hitokoto", "Tōzen Manpitsu", "Kanko-dōri", "Kagetsutei Nikki", "Seigo", and "Ōmu no Kotoba", among others. After his death, it was learned that he had written a satirical text parodying daimyo life. It was named "Daimyō Katagi".

Havlíčkův Brod

Havlíčkův Brod is a district town in the center of the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands on the Sázava river. Its population is about 24,000 people.

Settlement in Brod has been documented as far back as the 12th century. There was an easy passage across the Sázava river ("brod" means "ford" in English). In the 13th century, silver was found near the town. After that Smil of Lichtenburg invited German miners to settle the area. The town which was first called Brod and later Smilův Brod (Ford of Smil), was renamed to Německý Brod (German Ford). At the beginning of the 14th century, the stone city walls were built, but later during the Hussite Wars in 1422 the city was burned down by Jan Žižka. The town was resettled in 1429 by Czech people. In 1637 Německý Brod was promoted to royal city. After The Second World War, the city was renamed to Havlíčkův Brod (Ford of Havlíček), after Karel Havlíček Borovský, famous writer and journalist.

The Old Town Hall in the square is Renaissance style. There is a skeleton under its clock. According to a story this skeleton was the traitor Hnát.

Russian Space Forces

The Russian Space Forces was one of the 6 branches of the Russian Military that is responsible for space operations. The branch controls many space stations throughout Russia. The branch is also part of the Ministry of Defence. The main tasks are to inform officials about incoming missile attacks, anti-missile defense, and to create orbit space vehicles. The Russian Space Forces was replaced by the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces on 1 December 2011.

In 1967, the Troops of Anti-Missile and Anti-Space Defence by the Soviet Union. The branch was then named Ministry of Defence Space Units in 1982. Then in 1991, the Soviet Union broke up. So the new Russian Military created the Russian Space Forces. The branch was abandoned in 1992, but brought back in 2001. General Vladimir Popovkin took the lead of the branch in 2004, after the previous leader, Colonel General Anatoly Perminov.

Contemporary art

Contemporary art means modern art done after Pop Art and Conceptual Art. Another term, which really means the same thing, is postmodern art. Yet another term, which goes wider than art, is Postmodernism.

This problem of labelling comes about because the word 'modern' in art was used for some art from the mid-Victorian period through the whole 20th century. It covers a wide range of styles and movements. So when art critics wanted to describe post-WWII art they had to use a different word. Thus, in art, 'contemporary' (which really means 'at the same time as') comes to mean 'modern', and modern comes to mean 'earlier'.


Russian Ground Forces

The Russian Ground Forces (), also known as the Russian Army (, ), are the land forces of the Russian Armed Forces.

The main responsibilities of the Russian Ground Forces are the protection of Russia's borders, combat on land, and the defeat of enemy troops. The President of Russia is the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. The Main Command of the Ground Forces is based in Moscow.

As the Soviet Union dissolved, Soviet officials tried to keep the Soviet Armed Forces as a single military for the new Commonwealth of Independent States. The last Minister of Defence of the Soviet Union, Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, was made supreme commander of the CIS Armed Forces in December 1991. Once it became clear that Ukraine (and possibly the other republics) was going to form their own armed forces, the new Russian government moved to form its own armed forces.

Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree creating the Russian Ministry of Defence on 7 May 1992. This created the Russian Ground Forces and the other branches of the military.

The Ministry of Defence newspaper "Krasnaya Zvezda" published a reform plan on 21 July 1992. The General Staff turned further towards conservatism. This caused a lot of problems. The reform plan wanted a change from an Army-Division-Regiment structure to a Corps-Brigade structure. They wanted the new structures to be better in a situation with no front line.

Few of the reforms planned in the early 1990s actually happened. This was for three reasons: Firstly, there was not enough help or support from the government, with President Yeltsin mainly interested in making sure that the Armed Forces were controllable and loyal, rather than reformed. Secondly, there was not enough funding. Finally, there was no consensus in the military about what reforms should happen.

The new Russian Ground Forces also got a growing crime problem from their Soviet predecessors. As draft resistance grew in the last years of the Soviet Union, the authorities put people with criminal records and who spoke little or no Russian in the army. Crime rates grew quickly. Weapons disappeared or were stolen more as well.

In March 2011, Military Prosecutor General Sergei Fridinsky reported that crimes had been rising in the Russian Ground Forces for the past 18 months, with 500 crimes reported in the period of January to March 2011 alone.

In August 2012, Prosecutor General Fridinsky again said that there was a rise in crime. Murders rose by more than half, bribery cases doubled, and drug trafficking rose by 25% in the first six months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. The Union of the Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia said the state of the Russian army was a "crime against humanity".

In July 2013, the Prosecutor General's office showed that corruption in 2013 rose 450% compared to 2012. This corruption cost the Russian government 4.4 billion rubles (US$130 million).

With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Chechens declared independence in November 1991. They declared independence under the leadership of a former Air Forces officer, General Dzhokar Dudayev. Chechen independence was seen as lowering Moscow's authority. Chechnya was seen as a haven for criminals. Soon a group within the Kremlin wanted war. A Security Council meeting was held 29 November 1994 on the issue. Yeltsin ordered the Chechens to disarm, or else Moscow would invade. Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told Yeltsin that he would "take Grozny with one airborne assault regiment in two hours."

The operation started on 11 December 1994 and, by 31 December, Russian forces were entering Grozny, the Chechen capital. The 131st Motor Rifle Brigade was told to make a push for the centre of the city. However, it was almost fully destroyed in Chechen ambushes. After finally taking Grozny, Russian troops moved on to other Chechen strongholds. Chechen militants took hostages in the Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis in Stavropol Krai in June 1995. This caused hope for peace. However, the fighting continued. After this incident, the Chechen separatists were called "insurgents" or "terrorists" in Russia.

Dzhokar Dudayev was assassinated in a Russian airstrike on 21 April 1996. In that summer, a Chechen attack retook Grozny. Secretary of the Security Council Alexander Lebed began talks with the Chechen rebel leader Aslan Maskhadov in August 1996 and signed an agreement on 22/23 August. The agreement was that by the end of that month, the fighting would end. The ceasefire was signed in the Dagestani town of Khasavyurt on 31 August 1996.

The Second Chechen War started in August 1999 after Chechen militias invaded Dagestan. After this was a series of four terrorist bombings across Russia. This caused Russian military action against the alleged Chechen culprits.

In the First Chechen War, the Russians bombarded an area with artillery and airstrikes before moving the land forces. Improvements were made in the Ground Forces between 1996 and 1999 and its performance during the Second Chechen War improved because of this.

The war started to slow down, however. Small-scale conflict continued to happen. As of November 2007, fighting had spread across other parts of the Russian Caucasus. The Second Chechen War officially ended on 16 April 2009.

Russia started putting many troops on the Ukrainian border starting in late 2021.

On February 24, 2022, Russian troops began invading Ukraine. During this invasion, Russia lost many tanks to Ukrainian anti-tank systems. As of 6 May, at least 12 generals have been killed in Ukraine.

The Russian Ground Forces has lots of vehicles and equipment. A lot of these are older Soviet designs.

New equipment, like the Armata Universal Combat Platform, Bumerang, and Kurganets-25, has been brought in since 2015. They have begun replacing old tanks and armored vehicles such as the BMPs, BTRs like the T-72, T-90, BMP-1/2/3, and BTR-80s.

Figures listed as "Active" only include equipment that is in active service.

The Russian Army kept most of the ranks of the Soviet Army, with some small changes.

The city served as the first Missouri capital from 1821 to 1826. The Saint Rose Philippine Duchesne shrine is in Saint Charles. It is also the home of the St. Louis National Weather Service Forecast Office, serving central, east-central and northeastern Missouri, as well as west-central and southwest Illinois.

This church was destroyed by a tornado in 1916. The Spanish Lieutenant-Governor Carlos de Hault de Lassus appointed Daniel Boone commandant of the Femme Osage District, which he served until the United States government bought the area in the Louisiana Purchase in 1804. The name of the town, San Carlos, was anglicized (turned into English) to become St. Charles. 

Missouri became a US state in 1821. The government decided to build a new state capital, the "City of Jefferson", in the center of the state on the Missouri River. A temporary capital was needed, and St. Charles beat eight other cities in a competition to be the temporary capitol. It offered free meeting space for the legislature in rooms above a hardware store. This building is preserved as the First Missouri State Capitol State Historic Site. It is open to tourists. The Missouri government met there until Jefferson City was ready in 1826.

Ferlinghetti began painting in Paris in 1948. In San Francisco he occupied a studio that he inherited from Hassel Smith. His first works show the influence the New York abstract expressionists. A more figurative style is apparent in his later works. Ferlinghetti’s paintings have been shown at various museums around the world.

"60 years of painting", the exhibition held in Italy in 2010, is a creative journey through the twentieth century, reflecting on the role of the artist nowadays.
Ferlinghetti died of lung disease on February 22, 2021 at his home in San Francisco at age 101.

Ferlinghetti received the Premio Taormina in 1973. He also received the Premio Camaiore, the Premio Flaiano, the Premio Cavour, among other honors in Italy. 

From 2009 he was on the Honour Committee of IMMAGINE&POESIA, the artistic literary movement founded in Turin, Italy, with the patronage of Aeronwy Thomas (Dylan Thomas's daughter).

Dynasties in Chinese history

Many Chinese dynasties have ruled the country during its history. China is a society which has had a very long history. This history was affected by the dynasties which have ruled it. They have slowly changed China into its current form.

The Xia dynasty lasted from 2070 BC until 1600 BC. It was the first ruling dynasty in Chinese history. The Xia was probably created by emperor Yu the Great. It is not known for certain if the Xia dynasty actually existed. Many people think that the Xia dynasty is only a legend. This is because there is no evidence that can prove that there was some dynasty before 1600 BC. There were found some archaeological excavations from 1500 BC which may come from the Xia dynasty. For example one of the excavations causes archaeologists to believe that the foundations of China were created during the Xia dynasty. Also there are findings of the oldest Chinese calendar called a lunar calendar. Xia dynasty was ended by a dynasty named Shang.

The Shang dynasty lasted from 1600 BC until 1046 BC. It started when Tang took control from the last Xia emperor, Jie. The dynasty ended with the suicide of Di Xin.

The Shang dynasty was important for Chinese culture. The first Chinese character fonts were created at this time. They were mainly used by seers and shaman. People made their own ritual vessels, agricultural and craft tools and even weapons. Everything was made of cast bronze.

In agriculture, millets, wheats and rice were the main crops. Mulberries were also grown. They were used to feed mulberry silkworms.

The Zhou dynasty lasted from 1045 BC until 256 BC. The Shangs had became weak because they were always fighting with a neighboring tribes. This was good for the less advanced Zhou. They defeat the Shang in the current town of An-yang. After that, the Zhou dynasty took the government. They ruled for the longest time of all Chinese dynasties.

Zhous were nomadic shepherds from the Shanxi province. The rulers of Zhou dynasty divided the country into four smaller areas. Each of these areas were controlled by relatives and members of aristocracy. Princes controlled fortified towns with a peasant background. They also helped the rulers at times of war. This form of government allowed the Zhou rulers to control more area.



Ethernet hub

An ethernet hub is an electronic device that runs a computer network. It is a simple device and is easy to configure. A hub acts like a repeater: all data that arrives to one port is sent to all other ports (without looking at IP address for the data's destination). That means that all devices in this network will get all data. A hub is a very simple device and does not operate Ethernet traffic. In contrast, a switch hub has a lower latency. Many hubs have LED signal lamps to show the state of the hub (which ports are connected and if the hub is working). A "collision" happens when two or more devices on the same network try to send packets at the same time. When collisions happen all of the devices have to go through a routine to resolve the conflict. The process is set in the Ethernet Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) protocol.

Some hubs may also come with a BNC and/or Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) connector to allow connection to legacy 10BASE2 or 10BASE5 network segments.

There are three kinds of hubs:

Hubs can be used for:
Historically, the main reason for purchasing hubs rather than switches was their price. Today few hubs are produced, because they are not an effective solution for building networks.

Heian-kyō

In 794, Emperor Kammu established this city as Japan's capital. The move from Heijō-kyō to Heian-kyo marks the beginning of the Heian period of Japanese history.

Lancaster, Pennsylvania

Lancaster (Pennsylvania Dutch: "Lengeschder") is a city in the south-central part of Pennsylvania. It is the county seat of Lancaster County. It is one of the older inland cities in the United States. It has a population of 58,039. It ranks eighth in population among Pennsylvania's cities. The Lancaster metropolitan area population is 552,984. So, it is 101st among US metropolitan areas.

Lancaster was home to James Buchanan, the nation's 15th president, and to congressman and abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens.

The city's main industries include healthcare, tourism, manufacturing, and professional services. It also has the Park City Center shopping mall. A controversial, citywide video surveillance system includes the most outdoor cameras per person of any US city.
It was first called Cuteanal Town. Its first leader, John Wright, renamed the city after his home English city of Lancaster. The city's symbol, the red rose, is from the House of Lancaster. Lancaster was part of the 1681 Penn's Woods Charter of William Penn, and was laid out by James Hamilton in 1734. It was incorporated as a borough in 1742 and incorporated as a city in 1818. When the British captured Philadelphia in the American Revolution, Lancaster became the capital of the colonies on September 27, 1777. After the Continental Congress met one day, they moved still farther away, to York, Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania government also moved from Philadelphia to Lancaster, but stayed in Lancaster until the British troops left Philadelphia. Lancaster was capital of Pennsylvania again from 1799 to 1812, after which the capital was moved to Harrisburg.

In 1737, the Lancaster County Prison was built in the city, styled after Lancaster Castle in England. The prison remains in use. Public hangings were conducted there until 1912.

The first paved road in the United States was the former Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike (which makes up part of the present-day U.S. Route 30). The Turnpike opened in 1795. The Turnpike connected the cities of Lancaster and Philadelphia, and was designed by a Scottish engineer named John Loudon MacAdam. Lancaster residents use the word, ""macadam"", instead of "pavement" or "asphalt". This is a reference to the paving process used by MacAdam.

The city of Lancaster was home to several important figures in American history. Wheatland, the estate of James Buchanan, the fifteenth President of the United States, is one of Lancaster's most popular attractions. Thaddeus Stevens, considered among the most powerful members of the United States House of Representatives, lived in Lancaster as an attorney. Stevens gained notoriety as a Radical Republican and for his abolitionism. The Fulton Opera House in the city was named for Lancaster native Robert Fulton, who had designed the modern steamboat. 

After the American Revolution, the city of Lancaster became an iron-foundry center. Two of the most common products needed by pioneers to settle the Frontier were manufactured in Lancaster: the Conestoga wagon and the Pennsylvania long rifle. The Conestoga wagon was named after the Conestoga River, which runs through the city. 

In 1803, Meriwether Lewis visited Lancaster to be educated in survey methods by the well-known surveyor Andrew Ellicott. During his visit, Lewis learned to plot latitude and longitude as part of his overall training to lead the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

In 1879, Franklin Winfield Woolworth opened his first successful "five and dime" store in the city of Lancaster. The F. W. Woolworth Company is succeeded by Foot Locker.

Lancaster was one of the winning communities for the All-America City award in 2000.

Lancaster is located at 40°02'23" North, 76°18'16" West (40.039860, -76.304366), and is above sea level.

The city is about southeast of Harrisburg, west of Philadelphia, north-northeast of Baltimore and north of Washington, D.C.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and 1.65% is water.

According to Lancaster's 2009 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:

Lancaster has one of the highest rates of green roof space per capita in the US. It now has of green roofs for a city with a downtown population of 65,000.
Community discussion of rising crime rates sought to avoid a government- or police-operated system of cameras. The Lancaster Community Safety Coalition (LCSC) was registered with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a nonprofit in 2004 to set up a video surveillance system. Paid LCSC staff are background checked by the FBI and trained to monitor the network of 164 closed-circuit TV cameras in the city.

In 2009, the LCSC's expansion from 70 to a 165 camera network attracted national attention. The national attention led to people asking to end the system. MSNBC commentator Keith Olbermann used the story in his 'Worst Person in the World' segment, "calling out the 'citizen patriots of Lancaster, Pennsylvania' and criticizing them for spying on each other". The surveillance system was also featured on ABC's "Nightline" and "CBS Evening News".

Although public opinion was initially mixed among Lancaster residents, statistical and anecdotal data suggest that the network of cameras is achieving the desired effect. In the fall of 2010, the Lancaster Community Safety Coalition was among several factors credited for a 13.7% drop in Lancaster's violent crime rate according to the FBI's Unified Crime Report. Property crime dropped 7.1% during the same period. Neighboring cities have not experienced similar reductions in crime. Although in the year 2010 cameras only helped solve 28 of the 6,653 crimes committed in the city. Although the year of 2009 received a reduction in violent crimes of over 13% and recorded 465 violent offenses, the following year of 2010 saw a rise in violent offenses. Violent offenses jumped from 465 in 2009 to 511 in 2010. Lancaster Community Safety Coalition had a success rate of preventing and helping police catch a suspect in .037% of crimes committed and Lancaster has more unsolved homicides since the installation of the cameras.

The Red Rose Transit Authority (RRTA) provides local bus transit in Lancaster City and surrounding areas. 

Bieber Trailways (formerly Capitol Trailways) provides intercity bus transit from the Lancaster Train and Bus Station to King of Prussia, Philadelphia, and New York City to the east, and York and Harrisburg to the west.

Amtrak also serves the Lancaster Train and Bus Station, located on the northernmost edge of the city at 53 East McGovern Avenue. The "Pennsylvanian", with service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, as well as the "Keystone Service", which runs from Harrisburg to New York via Philadelphia, both serve Lancaster. The city is served by the Lancaster Airport, located six miles (10 km) north of downtown and just south of Lititz.

Lancaster is also a hub for automobile traffic, with many major roadways passing through or around the city, including US-30, US-222, PA-283, PA-72, and PA-272.

The city of Lancaster has several museums that preserve its important contributions to society. The Demuth Museum is in the former home of a well-known Lancaster painter named Charles Demuth. Additional art museums include the Lancaster Museum of Art and the Philips Museum of Art on the campus of Franklin & Marshall College. Art students at the state-of-the-art Pennsylvania College of Art and Design present their works at the academy's gallery that is open to the public. The Lancaster County Quilts and Textile Museum celebrates the hand-sewn quilts and other textile items produced by the region's Amish and Mennonite communities. Lancaster also possesses two other museums showing Pennsylvania Dutch heritage with the Lancaster Mennonite Historical Society Museum and the Heritage Center Museum. Children can have a hands-on experience with educational learning at the Hands-on House, also known as Children's Museum of Lancaster. Nature and geology-minded visitors can view the more earthly exhibits of the Louise Arnold Tanger Arboretum and the North Museum of Natural History and Science. Upon completion, the Lancaster County Convention Center will incorporate the Stevens and Smith Historic Site, a museum that will include the preserved home of Thaddeus Stevens and his confidante Lydia Hamilton Smith.
The School District of Lancaster runs the city's public schools. The local high school campuses are McCaskey and McCaskey East. Established in 1836, it is the second oldest school district in Pennsylvania. Lancaster Catholic High School was founded in 1926. It is under the jurisdiction of the diocese of Harrisburg. With a P-12 enrollment of more than 500 students, Lancaster Country Day School is one of the region's largest independent nonsectarian schools. Founded in 1908 as the Shippen School for Girls, the school later became coeducational.

Lancaster area hosts several colleges and universities including: Consolidated School of Business, Franklin & Marshall College, Lancaster General College of Nursing & Health Sciences, Lancaster Theological Seminary, Lancaster Bible College, Pennsylvania College of Art and Design, Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology, Millersville University of Pennsylvania, Central Pennsylvania College,and the Harrisburg Area Community College.

Eurasian Union

The Eurasian Union () is a project of political and economic union whose members are Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and could include other countries from Europe and Asia, such as, for example, countries that were once part of the USSR.

The idea was suggested in October 2011 by the Prime Minister of Russia, Vladimir Putin, but the idea was first proposed by the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, in a speech, in 1994, in Moscow. On 18 November 2011, the presidents of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia signed an agreement in which they agreed to create the Eurasian Economic Union by 2015. The agreement talked about the membership of candidate states and created the Eurasian Commission (which is based on the European Commission) and the Eurasian Economic Space, which both started work on 1 January 2012.

Electronic gear shifting

Electronic gear shifting is a way of shifting gears on a bicycle. It lets bicycle riders use a switch to shift gears, instead of a lever. Electronic gear shifting can be faster than shifting gears with a lever.

The standard system for gearing up and down works with bowdens. A bowden is special kind of wound steel cable, which connects levers to the shifter, derailleur or brakes. As the rider pulls or taps a lever, the bowden reacts at the same time. That causes the bicycle to change gear.

Electronic works without bowdens. The system is digital. There is no wound steel cable. Instead, there are multiple combinations of 0 and 1. A battery placed under the frame powers the system. Each battery should last for 1000 km depending on the manufacturer. Then it needs to be recharged. Wires for data and power are hidden inside the frame. Parts of the shifting systems are connected to each other. Servomotors do the shifting. The shifter and derailleur have a pair of servomotors built into them. There is a self-adjustable microchip in the derailleur. The system has its own logic, which keeps the chain from dropping. There is no need for maintenance because the derailleur adjusts itself using the microchip.

Languages of Canada

Lots of languages are used in Canada. English and French are used by most Canadians. Only New Brunswick uses both English and French as its official languages. Quebec's official language is French. English and French are recognized by the Constitution of Canada as "official languages." This means that all laws of the federal government are in both English and French and that federal government services can be available in both languages.

Many Canadians believe that the relationship between the English and French languages is important. 

To know how many people speak them, Canada's census collects a lot of kinds of information not collected in most other countries, including home language, mother tongue, first official language and language of work.

People speak other languages. About 18% of Canadians (about 6.1 million people, most are immigrants) have a language other than English or French as their first language or mother tongue. Nearly 3.5 million Canadians continue to use their other language most often, like when at home or in social settings. The biggest ones are Italian, German, Chinese, Punjabi, Arabic and Dutch.

Canada also has many native languages. But they are not spoken by many people (less than one percent of Canada), and fewer people speak them every year.

Underground Railroad

The Underground Railroad was a secret network of routes and safe houses in the United States. Black slaves used the Underground Railroad to escape from slavery. It was created in the early 1800s, and was at its biggest between 1850 and 1860. The term “Underground Railroad” also describes the abolitionists, both black and white, free and enslaved, who helped the slaves along the way. 

Routes on the Underground Railroad led to free states, Canada, Mexico and overseas. While traveling along these routes, slaves received help from abolitionists and those who had sympathy to their cause. British North America was another popular stopping point. Slavery was not allowed there, and its long border gave many points of access. More than 30,000 people were said to have escaped there using the network at its best, although U.S. Census statistics shows only 6,000. 

One statistic suggests that by 1850, about 100,000 slaves had escaped to freedom by the "Railroad". 

The Underground Railroad fugitives' stories are recorded in the Underground Railroad Records.

Brick Lane

Brick Lane is a street in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, in the East End of London. It is part of an old area which includes Bethnal Green, Whitechapel, Spitalfields and Petticoat Lane.

Today, it is the heart of the city's British Bangladeshi community and is known to some as "Banglatown". It is famous for its many curry houses.

Brick Lane gets its name from former brick and tile manufacture, using the local brick earth deposits, that began in the 15th century.

Successive waves of immigration began with Huguenot refugees spreading from Spitalfields, where the master weavers were based, in the 17th century. This started a connection with clothing which lasted for over three centuries.

The Huguenots were followed by Irish, Ashkenazi Jews and, in the last century, Bangladeshis. The area became a centre for weaving, tailoring and the clothing industry, due to the abundance of semi- and unskilled immigrant labour.

Brewing came to Brick Lane before 1680, with water drawn from deep wells. One brewer was Joseph Truman, first recorded in 1683. His family went on to establish the sizable Black Eagle Brewery on Brick Lane.

The Brick Lane Market was developed in the 17th century for fruit and vegetables. The Sunday market, like the ones on Petticoat Lane and nearby Columbia Road, dates from a dispensation given to the Jewish community. The Brick Lane Farmers' Market opened 6th June 2010.

Emma Elizabeth Smith was viciously assaulted and robbed in Osborn Street, the part of Brick Lane that meets Whitechapel High Street, in the early hours of 3 April 1888. It was one of the first of the eleven Whitechapel Murders, some of which were done by the serial killer, Jack the Ripper.

In 1742, La Neuve Eglise, a Huguenot chapel, was built on the corner of Brick Lane and Fournier Street. By 1809, it had become The Jews’ Chapel, for promoting Christianity to the expanding Jewish population, and became a Methodist Chapel in 1819 (John Wesley having preached his first covenant sermon at the nearby Black Eagle Street Chapel). In 1898, the building was consecrated as the Machzikei HaDath, or Spitalfields Great Synagogue. In 1976, it became the London Jamme Masjid (Great London), to serve the expanding British Bangladeshi community. The building is Grade II* listed. Many Bangladeshi immigrants to Brick Lane were from the Greater Sylhet region. These settlers helped shape Bangladeshi migration to Britain; families from Jagannathpur and Bishwanath tend to dominate in the Brick Lane area today.

Svitavy

Svitavy (German: "Zwittau") is a town in the Czech Republic. About 17,000 people live there. A small river, also called Svitava, flows through the city from a nearby spring. 

The original settlement with a church was founded by monks from and called after the flowing river Svitava. Later German settlers started to come here. They founded a new village with a church of St.Giles. Original Svitava slowly merged with the new village. The area around Svitavy became the subject of conflict between the bishop of Olomouc and a monastic manor from Litomyšl, 1256 conflict was settled in favour of the Bishop of Olomouc. So the year 1256 started the history of our town. In 2006 we celebrated 750 year from the foundation of town Svitavy.


The town has a permanent museum exposition called Searching the Star of David - Oskar Schindler - Righteous Among the Nations (“Hledání Davidovy hvězdy - Oskar Schindler - Spravedlivý mezi národy“).

Sunset Boulevard

Sunset Boulevard is a long road in west Los Angeles. It stretches 24 miles (39 km) from Figueroa Street in downtown (central) Los Angeles to the Pacific Coast Highway in Pacific Palisades at the Pacific Ocean. Part of the Boulevard, called Sunset Strip, passes through Hollywood.

The boulevard is at least four lanes wide for all of the route. Car accidents are not uncommon due to the lack of a central divider on most sections. The road also has difficult curves and hills that a driver cannot see over.

Sunset often has more cars on it than were planned for. It is worn, and has cracks and potholes. Traffic on Sunset is often slow, especially during the rush hour. But when traffic is mild, Sunset is a fast thoroughfare because it has few (and short timed) traffic lights in the western part. Even at rush hours, cars move without waiting, as the lights are well spaced and timed.

This is the 1½ mile (2.4) km strip running through West Hollywood. The Strip is well-known; it has boutiques, restaurants, and nightclubs that are part of the entertainment industry. It is also known for its trademark array of huge, colorful billboards and is a 'hangout' for rock stars, movie stars and other entertainers.

Sunset Strip was the location of a popular TV show "77 Sunset Strip" (1958–1964), starring Ephrem Zimbalist Jnr. Many young stars made an appearance in the series.

Sunset Boulevard gave its name to a famous 1950 movie of the same name, starring Gloria Swanson, William Holden and Eric von Stroheim.

3D television

The function of 3D television is making a two-dimensional screen look like its picture is in three dimensions. This effect starts when we observe two shifted displays.

Basic division of 3d technologies

3D televisions in shops and e-shops are in 90% of cases stereoscopic. Glasses are used to see the picture in three dimensionals. The glasses divide display into two components (either shifted in color or otherwise).

3D TV can do anything as well as 2D TV. The newest types of TV even can convert 2D into 3D but the quality is low.

Movies in 3D format are still scarce. Few people would invest their money into partially exploited machine.

The best 3D television images are on larger television screens.

The closer a person sits to the screen, the stronger the 3D effect. Three-dimensional image processing is also more difficult for the brain.

Because the observation of 3D space in a 3D TV is so hard, viewers should be sitting during the watching 3D TV.

Martha Argerich

Martha Argerich (born 5 June 1941 in Buenos Aires, Argentina) is an Argentine classical pianist of Jewish descent.

Argerich was born in Buenos Aires and started playing the piano at age three. At the age of five, she moved to teacher Vincenzo Scaramuzza. Argerich gave her first concert in 1949 at the age of eight.
The family moved to Europe in 1955 where Argerich studied with Friedrich Gulda in Austria. She later learned with Stefan Askenase and Maria Curcio. Argerich also had brief periods of learning with Madeleine Lipatti (widow of Dinu Lipatti), Abbey Simon, and Nikita Magaloff. In 1957, at sixteen, she won both the Geneva International Music Competition and the Ferruccio Busoni International Competition, within three weeks of each other.

Argerich started to become famous around the world when she won the Seventh International Chopin Piano Competition in 1965 at the age of 24. She also made a recording in the same year, including pieces by Chopin, Brahms, Ravel, Liszt, and Prokofiev.

The Black Cauldron

The Black Cauldron is a fantasy novel written by Lloyd Alexander. It was published in 1965 as the second book in The Chronicles of Prydain series. "The Black Cauldron" was awarded a Newbery Medal. "The Black Cauldron" centers around Taran, an Assistant Pig-Keeper who lives in the fantasy land of Prydain.

The book begins with a meeting of many leaders. They make plans to stop the evil Arawn from taking over Prydain. The leaders decide to steal the Black Cauldron, a powerful tool, from Arawn. Prince Gwydion, the war lord of Prydain, leads a band of people into Annuvin, Arawn's country. When there, they learn that the cauldron has already been stolen. The Fair Folk (fairies) tell the group that the witches of Morva stole the cauldron. Prince Ellidyr, a poor youngest son, sneaks away from the group so that he can steal the cauldron for himself. The rest of the group follows to save him from Arawn's soldiers, but are attacked themselves. In the battle, Fflewddur Fflam and Doli are separated from the group. Also, Adaon, son of the chief bard, is wounded very badly. Before he dies, he passes on a brooch to Taran. The brooch has magical powers and Taran uses it to find Fflewddur and Doli. They continue to Morva, where Taran trades the brooch for the cauldron. The group then tries to smash it, but the witches tell them it can only be destroyed when a living person dies in it willingly. On the way back, Ellidyr attacks the group and steals the cauldron. The group is later found by King Morgant and his men, who have captured Ellidyr and beaten him. Morgant plans to use the cauldron to rule Prydain. Morgant ties up the entire group and offers to free them if Taran will join his service. While they are talking, Doli turns invisible and frees the whole group. During the fight that follows, Ellidyr throws himself into the cauldron, destroying it. King Smoit then comes and attacks Morgant, killing him. The group is rescued.

Telecommuting

Telecommuting or telework or remote work is a work arrangement in which employees have flexible working locations and hours. They use telecommunication links to work. Many work from home, while others, also called nomad workers or web commuters use mobile telecommunications technology to work from coffee shops or other places. Telework is a broader term, referring to substituting telecommunications for any form of work-related travel, thereby eliminating the distance restrictions of telecommuting. A person who telecommutes is called a "telecommuter". Some telecommuters say that "work is something you do, not something you travel to".

Working from home has always been possible for some people, but one of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic was to make it much more common. In many countries there were Stay-at-home orders and people had to find ways of working from home. This was mostly by using remote technology. Many people found they liked not having to go into a distant office, especially parents with young children. When they were told they should go back to working in their office many people refused. Hybrid working, where people work from home most of the time but do come into the office sometimes became common.

In Australia many people now have the right to work at home.

It is unclear whether working away from the Office effects performance at work.

Terra Nova (TV series)

Terra Nova was an American science fiction television series. It was broadcast from September 26 to December 19, 2011 on Fox. Fox has said they will not pick the series up for a second year. The series is shopped to other networks. The series tells the story of the Shannon family as they travel 85 million year into the past. The series starred Jason O'Mara and Stephen Lang.

In the future, Earth is overcrowded. Most plants and animals are extinct. The skies are dark grey and the air is barely breathable because of pollution. The only hope for humanity to survive is in the distant past. Scientists find a way to travel to the past. They decide to send people into prehistoric times. They want to try to rebuild civilization and not repeat the mistakes they have made in their own world. The group in the past calls their new home "Terra Nova". The name means "new land" in Latin. People are sent back in time in groups called "pilgrimages". The story told in the series begins in the year 2149. It continues 85 million years in the past.

The series is about the Shannon family as they join the Tenth Pilgrimage of settlers to Terra Nova. Jim Shannon is the father of the family. He is a former police officer. Jim’s wife, Elisabeth, is a surgeon. She is the newest member of Terra Nova’s medical team and the new chief medical officer. Jim and Elizabeth have three children; Josh, Maddy and Zoe. Josh () is their 17 year old son. Josh did not want to travel back in time because doing this meant he would have to leave his girlfriend. Upon arriving at Terra Nova, he finds himself instantly drawn to the beautiful and rule-breaking Skye. Maddy is Josh’s 15 years old sister. She hopes Terra Nova will give her a chance to reinvent herself. Zoe is the Shannon's 5 year old daughter.

When the Shannon family first gets to Terra Nova, they meet Commander Nathaniel Taylor. He is the first person to go to Terra Nova and leader of the settlement. Taylor warns the travelers that while Terra Nova is a place of new opportunities and fresh beginnings, all is not as idyllic as it looks. Along with blue skies, large waterfalls and vegetation, the land is full of danger. This danger is not just from the man-eating dinosaurs. There is also a second group of people lead by Mira, who is opposed to Taylor and his leadership. This group, the Sixers, came to Terra Nova on the Sixth Pilgrimage. Many of the people on that pilgrimage had secret reasons for being there.

The series was given both good and bad reviews. Before it was being broadcast, most critics liked the series. Near the middle of the season, this opinion changed. Many critics did not like the way the characters acted with each other. By the end of the season, the opinion of the critics had changed again and had become more positive.

Fly fishing

Fly fishing is a method of sport fishing. An artificial fly is cast into the target area with a fly line and fly-fishing rod. This way, the fisherman or woman can catch a lot of fish, both freshwater and marine. Fly fishermen and women use special equipment, such as fly-fishing rod, fly-fishing reel, fly-fishing line, and pitfalls, which are made from natural or synthetic sling materials.

Fly fishing probably began in ancient Egypt, but its modern form goes all the way back to the England of the second half of the 19th century. The local fishermen caught fish with live and later artificial insects. This method began to spread to the rest of Europe. National and international competitions and championships were started. This has brought fly fishing to the attention of the public. 

Lake fly fishing is done on backwaters and mostly on reservoirs, ponds and lakes. The actual hunt is done either from the bank or from the water, by fording or with the help of vessels like ships.

River fly fishing is usually done in flowing waters. It is normally done by fording. The fisherman or woman stands in the water dressed in special waders and wading boots. Fishing from the bank is also possible but it is not done very often. 

Sea fly fishing is done by fording as well as fishing from a boat.

Dry fly fishing is done with a floating line. The bait floats on the water. The fly often looks like hatched insects or other food on the water surface.

Wet fly fishing is done with all types of fly-fishing lines. The fly is underwater and looks like drowned or newly hatched insects. 

Streamer fishing is mostly done with sinking fly lines. The flies look like insects or other organisms.

Nymph fishing is done with all types of fly-fishing lines. The flies look like young insects.

Fly-fishing rod is a kind of fishing rod which is designed only for fly fishing. Its purpose is to give enough power to the fly-fishing line, which carries an artificial fly to the hunting area. 

The fly-fishing line moves an artificial fly to the place of casting. It is only supposed to be used for fly fishing and with the fly-fishing rod and fly-fishing reel. It is not suitable for other ways of fly fishing because it would be damaged.

The fly-fishing reel is used for storing and backing the fly-fishing line. The fly line is stored in a coil. This coil revolves around its vertical axis in the reel. The fly-fishing line is reeled by moving the coil. The coil is secured with a handle.

Merkava

The Merkava is a main battle tank. It is developed and produced in Israel for the Israel Defense Forces. The tank was first introduced in 1978 and first used in combat during the 1982 Lebanon War. Four main versions have been developed. These are called Merkava Mark I – Mark IV.

When designing the Merkava tank, everything was subordinated to the survival aspect of the crew, the engine is placed in front of the tank and thus serves as an additional component of ballistic protection, while the crew can escape from the damaged Merkava door at the rear of the tank. The thick armor and high mobility make it one of the best protected tanks in the world. The design team that developed the first version of this tank, led by commander of the Israeli armored corps, Israel Tal.

The Mark I weighed 63 tons. It had 900 horsepowers and the maximum speed was 46 km/h. It was armed with a 105-millimeter M64 main gun, and the M68 was later installed. Coaxially with the main gun, a 7.62 mm machine gun was mounted; the turret featured two more 7.62 mm machine guns as well as a 60 mm mortar mounted externally.

The Mark II was almost the same as the Mark I. The main differences were the internal mortar, better mobility and better resistance.

The Mark III weighed 65 tons. It had 1200 horsepowers and the maximum speed was 60 km/h. It was armed with a 120-millimeter MG251 main gun. Other equipment was almost same as the Mark II. The Mark III was longer and had better armor than the Mark II, and some new systems such as fire-control system were added.

The Mark IV weighs 65 tons. It has 1500 horsepowers and the maximum speed is over 60 km/h. The Mark IV is armed with a 120-millimeter MG253 main gun using an electrical semi-automatic revolving magazine for 10 rounds. Coaxially with the main gun, a machine gun was mounted; on the turret, there is one more machine gun operated from inside the tank, in addition to an internally mounted 60-mm mortar. Mark IV has a new fire-control system that allows for shooting down helicopters; upgraded tracks; a digital battlefield management system; etc.

One tank (Mark I) was donated to the Prague Military Technical Museum (Czech Republic), the only such exhibit in the world outside Israel.

Mining in Kutná Hora

In the Middle Ages, Kutná Hora belonged to one of the most important cities in the Bohemian Kingdom. The silver mining started in the second half of 13th century. Unfortunately, the exact date and place, where it all started, remains unknown. Because of that there are lots of legends about the discovery of silver. The most common legend tells a story of a monk named Anthony from the monastery in Sedlec. According to this legend 
the monk found out three silver rods at the foot of the hill.

The peak of mining in Kutná Hora was reached in 14th century. During ages there were lots of mines, but only few of them have been preserved. Last mine was closed during 17th century.

Mines were formed by shafts – pits going underground. Their depth varied from 20 to 150 metres. 

Miners worked with simple tools. Only 50 dm3 of rock were extracted within a six-hour shift. This technology allowed them to reach depths ranging from 400 to 450 metres in 14th century. The deepest mine in 16th century was the Osel (donkey) mine, which reached the depth of 600 metres.

Mine was discovered in 1967 during a hydro-geological exploration of the heart of the city. Originally it was thought that the legendary Osel mine had been discovered. But further exploration proved that it is St. George mine.

The mine was established around 1330’s and remained operational until the end of 15th or beginning of 16th century.

Nowadays visitors may see 250 meters long tunnel, but in total there more than 800m of stopes, drifts or corridors. During those 250 meters it’s possible to see several interesting areas. Such as drifts to other levels of mine, exploration drifts, partly flooded stope, fragments of wooden drainage or wooden props (protection against collapsing of ceiling).

Azerbaijan Democratic Republic

The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR) also known as Azerbaijan People's Republic was the first successful attempt to create a democratic and secular republic in the Muslim world before the Republic of Turkey. It was founded on May 28, 1918 after the collapse of the Russian Empire that began with the Russian Revolution of 1917 by the Azerbaijani National Council in Tiflis, Georgia. Its borders were with Russia in the north, Democratic Republic of Georgia in the north-west, Democratic Republic of Armenia in the west, and Persian Empire (Iran) in the south. It had a population of 2.86 million. Ganja was the temporary capital of the Republic as Baku, which is the de jure capital, was under Bolshevik control.

Under the ADR, the government was a parliamentary system in which a parliament, called the Milli Majlis (National Assembly of Azerbaijan) elected on the basis of universal, free, and proportional representation, was the highest political institution of state authority and the Council of Ministers was responsible before it. Fatali Khan Khoyski became its first prime minister. Besides the political party Musavat which had the majority in parliament, other political parties were Ehrar, Ittihad, Muslim Social-democrats as well as representatives of Armenian (21 out of 120 seats), Russian, Polish, Jewish and German minorities gained seats in the parliament. Some members supported Pan-Islamist and Pan-Turkist ideologies.

Among the important accomplishments of the parliament was to give women the right to vote, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim nation to give women equal political rights with men. Azerbaijan made these reforms earlier than the United Kingdom and the United States. Another important accomplishment of ADR was the establishment of Baku State University, which was the first modern-type university founded in Azerbaijan.

By March 1920, it became clear that Soviet Russia would attack and invade Azerbaijan. The Soviet Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin said that the invasion was justified by the fact that Soviet Russia could not survive without the Baku oil fields, which was at that time the largest oil field in the world with more than half of the world's oil reserves. According to the common opinion in Moscow, Russian Bolsheviks were to "help" the Baku proletariat (workers) in overthrowing the "counter-revolutionary nationalists", meaning the government and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.

After a major political crisis, the Fifth Cabinet of Ministers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic resigned on April 1, 1920. On April 25, 1920, the Soviet Russian 11th Red Army crossed into Azerbaijan, entering Baku on April 27. They demanded the closing of the Azerbaijani parliament and set up their own Bolshevik government headed by Nariman Narimanov. To avoid bloodshed, the members of parliament had to agree with the demand and the ADR officially ended on April 28, 1920, giving way to the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic as its successor state. The Red Army met very little resistance in Baku from the Azerbaijani army, which was tied up on the Karabakh front. The first Communist government of Azerbaijan consisted almost entirely of native Azerbaijanis from the left-wing political factions of the "Hummat" and "Adalat" political parties.

In May 1920, there was a major rebellion against the occupying Soviet Russian 11th Red Army in Ganja. People wanted to restore the Musavatists to power. The rebellion was crushed by government troops by May 31. Leaders of the ADR either fled to the Democratic Republic of Georgia, which was the last independent Caucasian country that was invaded in 1921 by Soviet Russia, then to Turkey and Iran, or were captured by Bolsheviks, like Mammed Amin Rasulzade, who was later allowed to emigrate, or were executed (killed) like Gen. Selimov, Gen. Sulkevich, Gen. Agalarov, a total of over 20 generals, or assassinated by Armenian terrorists like Fatali Khan Khoyski and Behbudagha Javanshir. Most students and citizens travelling abroad remained in those countries, never to return again to their country. Other important ADR military leaders like the former Minister of Defense General Samedbey Mehmandarov and deputy defense minister General Ali-Agha Shikhlinski (who was called "the God of Artillery" ) were at first arrested, but released two months later thanks to efforts of Nariman Narimanov. Gen. Mehmandarov and Gen. Shikhlinsky spent their last years teaching in the Azerbaijan SSR military school.

In the end, "the Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918-20 quickly or easily. As many as 20,000 died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest." However, the founding of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic was made easier by the fact that there was a certain popular support for Bolshevik ideology in Azerbaijan, among the industrial workers in Baku.

Warcraft: Lord of the Clans

Warcraft: Lord of the Clans is a novel written by writer Christie Golden. It is based on Blizzard Entertainment and was published in 2004. It is the second book in series of Warcraft.

The story was originally meant to be used for game but the project was canceled. The story itself wasn´t bad idea and role of main character was significant for games like Warcraft III or World of Warcraft. So the writer had to remake the story to form of book. She had only six weeks to do that.

Story is about son of orc Warchief. It started when he was a little baby. One day he and his parents were attacked by human soldiers in forest. Warchief and his wife were killed and one of humans took little orc baby with him to their base. The human was Aedelas Blackmoore and he named the baby Thrall which means slave to humans.
Blackmoore wasn´t sorry for him, he just wanted to use him as a source of power. His plan was to use Thrall as a Warchief and control through him orcs to serve Blackmoore.

Thrall and some other orcs were prisoned and learned to handle every weapon and how to use battle tactics effectively. They also tought Thrall basics of reading and writing. But he wanted to escape human base and find someone of his kind. One day his only human friend Taretha helped him. She set the base in fire and gave Thrall a chance to escape. Which he managed. After some time he found orc clan led by Grom Hellscream. When he learned some basic informations about orcs from Grom he headed to find his original clan, Frostwolf clan. There he met their shaman Drek´thar and Warchief Doomhammer. Drek´thar learned Thrall ancient ways of shamanism and Doomhammer told him about his parent´s death.

When Thrall managed art of shamanism, he raised together with Doomhammer an army against humans. Orcs won but Doomhammer died. In his last moments he granted Thrall the title of Warchief. Thrall decided to attack human base, home of Aedelas Blackmoore. He wanted to rescue imprisoned orcs there. They attacked and they succeeded in taking base. But only Blackmoore remained alive. Thrall went to his house, and when he entered he saw Blackmoore standing over dead body of Taretha. Angry Thrall killed blackmoore without any mercy.

Thunderstorm

Thunderstorms are small, intense weather systems that make strong winds, heavy rain, lightning, and thunder. Thunderstorms can happen anywhere with two conditions: the air near the Earth's surface must be warm and moist (with lots of liquid), and the atmosphere must be unstable. 100 lightning bolts hit the earth every second, and at any one moment, about 1,800 thunderstorms happen around the earth.

Thunderstorms are rare in winter, mostly because of cold weather. When they happen, it is called thundersnow. Thundersnow is common in blizzards.

Usually there are more clouds in the afternoon than in early morning. This is because the ground has warmed up enough by the afternoon for winds ("updrafts") to blow upward from the ground. When the air has gone high enough, the water vapor in it condenses into a cloud. The height where this happens depends on the temperature and humidity of the air. Sometimes the air can rise up as high as 5,000 to 10,000 feet (1,524 to 3,048 m) before a small cumulus cloud can condense from the invisible water vapor.

High, puffy little clouds do not change until a lot of moisture is added. This moisture helps the updraft. Moisture can add heat, which means the cloud will warm up inside and go up even faster. The moisture makes the cumulus cloud "mushroom" upwards and turn into a tall cumulus cloud. The winds inside this cloud are very strong. Thunder and lightning begins when the top of the cloud is 25,000 feet (7,280 m) high. The inside of the cloud is, by this time, cold enough so that the water drops are turned into ice crystals. A cumulus cloud stops growing when it hits the warm stratosphere. Some thunderstorms grow twice as high as Mount Everest.

Strong upper winds in the stratosphere smooth and spread the top of the cloud. This makes the cloud look like the top of a mushroom or an anvil. The ice crystals in the anvil cloud give it a fuzzy look. As a thunderstorm grows, water drops or ice crystals inside the cloud hit and mix with each other, getting bigger. The bottom of the cloud grows dark, with water about to fall. When the drops become so heavy that the winds inside the cloud cannot keep them up any more, they fall from the cloud as rain or hail. Even as they fall, the water drops grow by absorbing the smaller drops and make big raindrops. Hail becomes bigger inside the cloud. One thunderstorm cloud usually runs out of energy in about 30 to 50 minutes. But supercell thunderstorms can last for hours until they dissipate by outflow.

Thunderstorms are very active with electricity and so are also called electrical storms. Lightning is a large electrical discharge that happens between two opposite charged surfaces.

When lightning strikes, energy is let out. This energy moves to the air and makes air spread quickly and send out sound waves. Thunder is the sound that comes from the rapid spread of air along the lightning strike. Thunder is slower than lightning, because light is faster than sound.

Only about 10% of thunderstorms are thought to be severe. Severe thunderstorms cause high winds of more than , hail 1 inch in diameter (24 mm), flash floods, and tornadoes. Hailstorms damage crops, damage the metal on cars, and break windows. Sudden flash floods that happen because of heavy rains is the biggest reason for weather-related deaths.

Lightning, which happens with all thunderstorms, starts thousands of forest fires each year in the United States. Lightning also kills or injures hundreds of people a year in the United States.

Regular thunderstorms begin when warm air near the ground mix with moist air, which makes an updraft (a wind that goes upward). A severe thunderstorm needs a strong "up"draft and a strong "down"draft. A strong updraft is made when, firstly, the ground is very hot; secondly, when the air is very moist; and thirdly, the air above is very cold. When the updraft gets stronger, so does the thunderstorm.

Flash floods happen when slow-moving thunderstorms pour down much more water than usual in a small area. It rains so hard that the water can not soak into the ground fast enough, and the water rushes down the mountainsides or hills into streams and rivers. These streams and rivers cannot carry all the water, so it quickly floods. The most severe flash floods make the water level rise dangerously in streams, dry places, or canyons. Flash floods can make terrible mud slides and can move very quickly. They can roll big rocks, tear out trees, and destroy buildings and bridges.

Flash floods can also happen when two or more thunderstorms hit the same spot, one right after the other. They can happen when a dam bursts open or ice breaks up. Flash floods can also happen when it rains very hard on quickly melting snow.

Thunderstorms do not do only damage; however, they can be a great help to man and all living creatures. We get lots of water for many continents during the summer. Plants receive lots of life-giving rain when they need it. Without the thunderstorms, many continents would become dry. Fish would die, crops would fail, and animals would die.

Thunderstorms are also our natural air conditioners. Hot air at the surface rises up into the high atmosphere where the heat is put out into space. Clouds give us shade, and rain can cool down a hot day. Without thunderstorms, the earth would be as much as warmer. In the summer, dust, haze, and other pollutants come together in the lower atmosphere. When the air rises, either in cumulus clouds or in thunderstorms, it spreads the pollution higher up into the atmosphere. Rain from thunderstorms washes away many of these pollutants out of the air.

Lightning in thunderstorms also helps keep the electrical balance between the earth and the atmosphere. Lightning is also fertilizer. When it splits through the sky, it changes nitrogen gas in the air to nitrogen compounds. These fall to the ground and are added to the soil. Nitrogen is one of the main ingredients in fertilizer. Ten percent of the nitrogen fertilizer needed for farming is made by lightning.

So, even though thunderstorms are dangerous, they can be a great help. They give summer water, cool the earth, and clean the air. Lightning balances the earth's electricity and helps fertilize the soil. And after a thunderstorm, sometimes there is a rainbow.

Some tips to keep safe in a thunderstorm are:

2012 Atlantic hurricane season

The 2012 Atlantic hurricane season was an above average season in terms of ACE and damage but most storms were week and short lived. It was theevent that occurs when tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic basin. The season began when Tropical Storm Alberto formed on May 19, 2012. Four days later, Tropical Storm Beryl developed. It became a subtropical storm and on May 27, was upgraded to a tropical storm. This is the first time since the 1908 Atlantic hurricane season that two storms formed before the official start date. The 2012 Atlantic hurricane season began on June 1 and ended on November 30, 2012. There were no storms formed in the month of July.

Tropical Storm Alberto formed on May 19, 2012. It became an "early season storm" because it formed before the official start of the season. Tropical Storm Alberto dissipated on May 22 without making landfall. Its maximun sustatined winds were at 60 miles per hour.

Tropical Storm Beryl developed. It became a subtropical storm and on May 27, was upgraded to a tropical storm. It hit Jacksonville, Florida.

Hurricane Chris was the third tropical system. It formed on June 19. It was also the first hurricane of the season, unexpectedly becoming one. It was in an unfavorable environment, with cool sea waters and moderate vertical wind shear. Chris, after weakening from a hurricane, became a non-tropical cyclone southeast of Newfoundland on June 22.
This system became the record earliest 4th storm, which was broken in 2012. The storm made landfall in Florida, and caused bad flooding. Ten people died.

The following names were used for named storms in the North Atlantic in 2012. The names not retired from this list was used again in the 2018 season. This is the same list used in the 2006 season. The names Kirk, Oscar, Patty, Rafael, Sandy, and Tony were used for Atlantic storms for the first time in 2012. Kirk replaced Keith after 2000, but was not used in 2006.

On April 11, 2013 the name "Sandy" was retired due to the damage and deaths it caused. Sandy was replaced with "Sara" for the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Sara wasn't used in 2018.

Hlinsko

Hlinsko is a small city in east Bohemia in the Czech Republic. It is on the banks of the Chrudimka river, in the Bohemian-Moravian highlands on the border of the Iron Mountains. Hlinsko belongs to the Pardubice region. It has about 10,000 inhabitants. Hlinsko is about 590 meters away over the sea.

In the 11th century, there was created a potter’s camp on the route from Bohemia to Moravia. From there is taken name of the city, which comes from the word “hlína” (clay, material used by potters). First historical remark about Hlinsko comes from first half of 14th century.

From this time, Hlinsko belongs to domination of Rychmburk, which belongs to Tas from Rychmburk, later to Vartenberk and next to Arnošt Flaška from Pardubice. In this century, city obtained reeve’s department.

There was an old merchant’s route passing through Hlinsko, which was drawed in the Klaudián’s map from year 1518. In 1718, clan Kinských bought Rychmburk’s domination.

In 1834, Hlinsko became independent on authorities. In 1850, there was created district in Hlinsko. In 1871 was finished construction of the railroad and began traffic on the road from Pardubice to Havlíčkův Brod (passing through Hlinsko).

There are many well-preserved people’s buildings in Hlinsko and its neighborhood already from half of 18th century. In part of Hlinsko it is Betlém, in neighborhood it is outdoor museum of people’s architecture in Veselý Kopec, Dřevíkov, Svobodné Hamry and Možděnice. There is camp Ležáky about 10 kilometers from Hlinsko, which was burned by Nazis during World War Two.

In modern history, Hlinsko was district city in years 1949 – 1960, after 1960 city lost benefit of district and it was integrated to Chrudimský district against will of its exponents. City became administrative centre once again in 1.1.2003 after reform of public administration, when Hlinsko became city of third level (city with extended scope).

Set of people’s buildings is on right bank of Chrudimka river. Before it was part of the city formed by timbered cottages, in which potters and tailors lived. Building material was mainly wood, wall was only in part around heater.
In 1995, Betlém was declared as monumental reservation of people’s architecture.
Many of buildings was renewed. Visitors can look over here how people lived and what traditions they had. There take place periodical exhibitions, too.

There are expositions from history of Hlinsko district in museum. Visitors can find here a memorial hall of Adámků’s family, learn about history of education, crafting… They can see examples of contemporary suits and fashion accessories. There is permanent exposition of reliefs from Karel Lidický, and an exhibition of images. Name of this exhibition is “Výtvarné Hlinecko” and some of exhibited images are borrowed from National gallery.


For cultural self-realization is there cinema and theater.
For book lovers is there Hlinsko’s library, which has two sections: child’s and adult’s.
City’s cultural club Hlinečan offers a wide spectrum of theater shows, concerts, lectures and social actions for inhabitants of Hlinsko and its region. They are organized in Chamber theatre or in local Sokol house.
Every year there are organized Adámek’s folklore celebrations. There are concerned groups not only from Czech republic, but also from abroad. Groups Vysočan and Vysočánek are representing Hlinsko.
Hlinsko produce Hlinsko’s news, which appears every month.
City has also its own TV – Cable’s information service.

The biggest companies in Hlinsko:





Children from Hlinsko can attend three nursery schools. Next they can study at one of three primary schools (Ležáků, Smetanova, Resslova). There is also a special school for children with defects in writing, reading or counting.
There is also one secondary grammar school, Karel Václav Rais’s in Hlinsko. It offers four-year and eight-year study.
Parents can sign on their children to art school. It offers education in most artistic disciplines.

In city stadium with grassy playground there is possible to practice summer sports. It is possible to use covered swimming pool with sauna.
In winter, friends of ice-skating and ice-hockey can use winter stadium or ski lifts, running tracks and hills for sledging.



Sacagawea

Sacagawea (c. 1788 – c. December 20, 1812; was a Lemhi Shoshone woman who went along with the Lewis and Clark Expedition as an interpreter and guide. Lewis and Clark explored the Western United States with her, traveling thousands of miles from North Dakota to the Pacific Ocean between 1804 and 1806.

Sacagawea is well remembered today. When many people think about Lewis and Clark today, they also think about Sacagawea.

In 2000, the United States Mint issued the Sacagawea dollar coin in her honor, showing Sacagawea and her son, Jean Baptiste Charbonneau. The face on the coin was made to look like a modern Shoshone-Bannock woman named Randy'L He-dow Teton. This was because nobody knows exactly what Sacagawea looked like.

In 2001, she was given the title of Honorary Sergeant, Regular Army, by President Bill Clinton.

There is little information that is definitively known about Sacagawea.

At about thirteen years of age, Sacagawea was taken as a wife by Toussaint Charbonneau, a Quebecer trapper living in the village. He had also taken another young Shoshone named Otter Woman as a wife.

Sacagawea was pregnant with her first child when the Corps of Discovery arrived near the Hidatsa villages to spend the winter of 1804–1805. Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark built Fort Mandan. They interviewed several trappers who might be able to interpret or guide the expedition up the Missouri River in the springtime. They agreed to hire Charbonneau as an interpreter when they discovered his wife spoke Shoshone, as they knew they would need the help of Shoshone tribes at the headwaters of the Missouri.

Lewis wrote in his journal on November 4, 1804: 
Charbonneau and Sacagawea moved into the expedition's fort a week later. Clark nicknamed her Janey. Lewis wrote about the birth of Jean Baptiste Charbonneau on February 11, 1805.

In April, the expedition left Fort Mandan and headed up the Missouri River in "pirogues". They had to be poled against the current and sometimes pulled from the riverbanks. On May 14, 1805, Sacagawea rescued items that had fallen out of a capsized boat, including the journals and records of Lewis and Clark. The corps commanders, who praised her quick action, named the Sacagawea River in her honor on May 20.

By August 1805, the corps had found a Shoshone tribe and was trying to trade for horses to cross the Rocky Mountains. They used Sacagawea to interpret and discovered that the tribe's chief was her brother Cameahwait.

Lewis recorded their reunion in his journal:
And Clark in his:
The Shoshone agreed to trade horses to the group, and to provide guides to lead them over the cold and barren Rocky Mountains. The trip was so hard that they were had to eat candles just to live. When they went down into the more temperate regions on the other side, Sacagawea helped to find and cook camas roots to help them get their strength back.

As the expedition approached the mouth of the Columbia River on the Pacific Coast, Sacagawea gave up her beaded belt to let the captains trade for a fur robe they wanted to give to President Thomas Jefferson.

On the trip back, they came near the Rocky Mountains in July 1806. On July 6, Clark wrote "The Indian woman informed me that she had been in this plain frequently and knew it well... She said we would discover a gap in the mountains in our direction..." which is now Gibbons Pass. A week later, on July 13, Sacagawea told Clark to cross into the Yellowstone River basin at what is now known as Bozeman Pass. This was later chosen as the best route for the Northern Pacific Railway to cross the continental divide.

While Sacagawea has been thought of as a guide for the expedition, she probably only gave directions a few times. Her work as an interpreter certainly helped the party to talk with the Shoshone. However, the most important thing she did for the group may have been being there during the hard journey, which showed they did not want to attack any Native Americans they came across. While traveling through what is now Franklin County, Washington, Clark noted, "The Indian woman confirmed those people of our friendly intentions, as no woman ever accompanies a war party of Indians in this quarter," and, "the wife of Shabono our interpreter we find reconciles all the Indians, as to our friendly intentions a woman with a party of men is a token of peace."

After the expedition, Charbonneau and Sacagawea spent three years among the Hidatsa before accepting William Clark's invitation to live in St. Louis, Missouri in 1809.

Sacagawea gave birth to a daughter, Lizette, sometime after 1810. According to Bonnie "Spirit Wind-Walker" Butterfield, historical documents say that Sacagawea died in 1812 of an unknown sickness: 

As further proof that Sacagawea died in 1812, Butterfield writes:
"An adoption document made in the Orphans Court Records in St. Louis, Missouri states, 'On August 11, 1813, William Clark became the guardian of 'Tousant Charbonneau, a boy about ten years, and Lizette Charbonneau, a girl about one year old.' For a Missouri State Court at the time, to designate a child as orphaned and to allow an adoption, both parents had to be confirmed dead in court papers."

Australasia at the Olympics

Australasia at the Olympics is a history which includes 2 games in 2 countries and 53 athletes. Since 1908, Australasia (ANZ) has contributed to the growth of the "Olympic Movement".

Australasia's team first competed at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London.

Australasia was the name of a combined team of athletes from Australia and New Zealand. They competed together at the 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics. When the Olympic Games started up again in 1920 after World War I, the two countries sent separate teams to the Games.

The Australasia team won a total of twelve medals in the two games in which they competed. Most of these were in swimming. One New Zealander won a medal in 1908. Harry Kerr won a bronze in athletics. In 1912, two New Zealanders won medals. Malcolm Champion won a gold in swimming. Tony Wilding won a bronze in tennis. All other medalists for Australasia were Australians.

Generation kill

Generation Kill is a book written by Evan Wright in 2004. In 2003, American reporter Evan Wright joined members of the reconnaissance battalion of United States Marine Corps. As a war reporter with them he spent forty days in the first line of the invasion in Iraq. He described the way to Baghdad, first in articles for "Rolling Stone" magazine, and later in the book which became model for same-named seven-part miniseries. At the beginning of the book we can find a list of the main characters and a dictionary of abbreviations. The book has a prologue, 35 chapters and an epilogue. At the end of the book is thanks to members of the United States Marine Corps. In the text we can see photos taken by Evan Wright.

The story begins when Reporter (a nickname for Wright) first met the soldiers with whom he spent the whole time. Evan is assigned to a team whose team leader is sergeant Brad Colbert, nicknamed Iceman. Brad sits on the passenger seat. The driver is corporal Ray Person, The rear driver is James Trombley, the youngest member of the team, who is nineteen years old. Next to him is the main shooter, Corporal Walt Hassher. On the rear passenger seat is Reporter.

The book describes the passion for fighting, army humor and an aggressive way of war. The author gives a true view of the American army, their broken supply and some poor leadership skills. The book became very popular in America and got many awards.

Jawa Motors

Jawa Motors is a motorcycles company that produces mopeds. The company started in 1927 and owned by Janeček￼￼.￼ The name JAWA comes from the first two letters of words Janeček (factory owner) and Wanderer (factory name).

In 1932, František Janeček sold a new motorbike--the Jawa 175 Villiers. It was simple motorbike. It was popular because it was light weight. By 1935, 3000 of these motorbikes were produced.
In 1935 the same frame used engine JAWA 350 OHV. This motorbike was stronger and more luxury than previous type 175 Villiers. There was more chrome parts and a built-in speedometer. 4000 were produced.

The smallest Jawa motorbike before World War II was the Jawa 100 Robot. It was a small moped. About 12,000 were produced.
The start of World War II meant the end of motorbike production. Lots of motorbikes projects was created illegally, but only one realized, Jawa 350. 

In 1952 was produced one of travelling motorbike Jawa 500 OHC, there was used four stroke engine. This motorbike is used by the police and the army. 
To the 1960 JAWA cooperated with many countries, for example India, Turkey, Egypt. Firm IDEAL MOTORD in Majsur in India bought licences from Jawa mostly. 

In 1970 Jawa produced the "BIZON“ series, and after that Jawa 634, which were modernized to model 640. Jawa 638-640 has engine 350ccm, it is robust and favourite motorbike in class motorbike.

JAWA produced a lot´s of models of mopeds, for example JAWA 50 types 20,21 named „pionýr“ or „pařez“ This motorbikes were mostly sell in SSSR. 
Today Jawa is sold in many European countries. The newest models are JAWA 660, JAWA 125 and 50 Dandy, JAWA 250, 350 and. Basic of motorbikes is really the same like 70 years ago, but it is very modernized, mainly motors. Today stronger four-stroke motors are used, two-stroke motors are used to 350ccm.

In 1933 Jawa started to produce small cars. Ing. Janeček bought a licence from German Meisterklasse DKW. It was called JAWA 700. To 1934 was produced some one thousand cars of this type, because sale was full of small cars, so JAWA produced more motorbikes than cars, in season before war were motorbikes more favourite.

Cathedral of the Holy Spirit, Hradec Králové

The Cathedral of St. Ducha ("the holy spirit") is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Hradec Králové, Czech Republic. It was built in 1307. It was built by order of Eliška Rejčka because the church of St. Klement was too small. The church was burned and rebuilt several times between the 14th and 16th centuries. In the 17th century, the church was plundered by Swedish soldiers. In 1664, Pope Alexander VII blessed the church as a cathedral. The last repairs were done after World War II.

The cathedral has an old Gothic altar from the end of the 15th century. It also has an early baroque altar from the 17th century. There is a portrait of St. Antoním by Petr Brandla, a pastoforium made by Matej Rejsem and a pulpit by Josef Myslbek. Under the cathedral are 3 crypts. There is a legend that Jan Žižka z Trocnova, a famous Hussite commander, was buried there for a short time. In the towers are 4 bells named Leopold, Klement, Václav and Michal.

Computer network

A computer network is a group of two or more computers that are linked together. Networks are usually used to share resources, to exchange files, or to communicate with others.
A network is a set of nodes connected by communication links. A node can be a computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending or receiving data from or to the other node in the network.

Other devices are often needed for the network to work correctly. These include hubs and switches. Different kinds of network can be connected to each other with a router. In general, networks that use cables to connect can operate at higher speeds than those using wireless technology.

Computers in a network can be near each other, or far. A Local Area Network (LAN) connects computers which are close together. Building a LAN is easier than connecting different networks (by a Wide Area Network). The largest Wide Area Network is the Internet.

Computers can be part of several different networks. Networks can also be parts of bigger networks. The "local area network" in a small business is usually connected to the "corporate network" of the larger company. These connections may allow access to the "Internet". For example, a shop may use it to show merchandise on its Web site through a web server, or to convert received orders into shipping instructions.

A network must be connected with appropriate hardware. This can be wired or wireless. For a simple LAN, computers, media and peripherals are sufficient. WANs (wide area networks) and some large LANs (local area networks) need some additional devices like a bridge, gateway or router to connect different small or large networks.

A network needs a communication protocol (a system for exchanging messages between computing systems.) Microsoft Windows, Linux and most other operating systems use TCP/IP. Apple Macintosh computers used Appletalk in the 20th century, but use TCP/IP now.

One large network of communication technology would be difficult to implement. As a result, we split up various components of the network into smaller modules or layers. The standard model of a network is the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model set by the International Organization Standard (ISO).

Other network models exist, though they are all split into similar layers. Each layer uses the services that the layer below provides, while providing services for the layer above it. Each layer can only communicate with the same layer on the destination device.

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is a 7-layer network model specified by ISO (International Organization for Standardization) norm and is widely used all around the world. The concept of a seven-layer model was provided by the work of Charles Bachman, Honeywell information Services. Various aspects of OSI design evolved from experiences with the ARPANET, NPLNET, EIN and CYCLADES networks and the work in IFIP WG6.1.

The physical layer defines electrical and physical specifications for devices. It also specifies modulated and baseband transmission.
Baseband is digital data in their raw form (in binary, the language understood by the computer in the form of 0s and 1s - 1001 1101 1010 0011). This allows very fast and reliable transmission over short distances; however, the media tend to make the bits interfere with each other, the range of baseband transmission is very limited. It becomes worse with increasing speed. Baseband technology is frequently used on LAN.
Typical technology: Ethernet cables

In telecommunications, modulation is the process of conveying a message signal, for example a digital bit stream or an analog audio signal, inside another signal that can be physically transmitted. The device that provides modulation of the baseband signal is called a modulator, and the device that provides demodulation of the modulated signal back to baseband is called a demodulator. Today, the modulator and demodulator are integrated into one device called Modem (modulator-demodulator). Frequently used on WAN, WLAN, WWAN.

Typical technology: WI-FI, ADSL, cable TV connection (CATV)

The data link layer provides the functional and procedural means to transfer data between network entities and to detect and possibly correct errors that may occur in the physical layer.

The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences from a source host on one network to a destination host on a different network using the IP address.
An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. At present there are two versions of protocols in use – IPv4 and IPv6.

The transport layer provides transparent transfer of data between end users, providing reliable data transfer services to the upper layers. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) of the Internet Protocol Suite are commonly categorized as layer-4 protocols within OSI.

Commonly united into one layer in simplified network models, its main purpose is to interact with applications, encrypting and establishing dedicated connections if necessary.

Latency, incorrectly called ping, is a value that measures how much time packets need to travel to their destination. It is measured in milliseconds (ms). The tool that measures latency is called ping, commonly using special ICMP packets which are smaller than standard data packets so they do not weight the network by their presence.
Capacity is a measure of transfer capacity of a network and is measured in bits per second (bps or b/s), today commonly Mbps or Mb/s. It shows us how many data units are transferred each second. At present, the average bandwidth is far higher than is necessary and it is not a limiting factor in most cases.

Broadcast is a special transmission that is not meant for a single device but is addressed to all devices in specific network. It is mostly used to automatically issue IP addresses to devices by a DHCP server and to create an ARP table that maps the network and speeds up the traffic.

Sequoia (genus)

Sequoia is a genus of redwood trees in the Cupressaceae family. It includes the largest trees in the world. The only living species of the genus is Sequoia sempervirens, the coast redwood, in northern California and southern Oregon in the United States. Several other species have been named from fossils, but are now extinct. These include "Sequoia affinis", "Sequoia chinensis" in China, "Sequoia langsdorfii", "Sequoia dakotensis" of South Dakota, and "Sequoia magnifica". Other related species of the subfamily Sequoioideae include Sequoiadendron Giganteum, the Giant Sequoia and Metasequoia Glyptostroboides, the Dawn Redwood.

The oldest known fossils in the "Sequoia" genus are those of "Sequoia jeholensis", which have been found in Jurassic deposits of southern Manchuria. By the late Cretaceous it had spread to other parts of China, Europe, and western North America.

Giant sequoia are much more recent in the fossil record, appearing 25 million years ago. They grow only in 75 groups across 35,600 acres in California, near the Sierra Nevada mountains. These groups were formed as a protection from logging. The most famous area with giant sequoia trees is Sequoia National Park. The park was made as the second national park, after the Yellowstone in 1980. The Sequoia National Park is managed with Kings Canyon National Park. Together, the two parks are called Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Several trees in Sequoia National Park have even been named, for example General Grant, the Grizzly Giant or General Sherman.

New Bern, North Carolina

New Bern () is a city in Craven County, North Carolina. It has a population of 31,291 as of 2020. It is located where the Trent and the Neuse rivers meet. The city is east of Raleigh and northeast of Wilmington. New Bern is the county seat of Craven County. New Bern is the birthplace of the international drink, Pepsi Cola.

New Bern was a Native American town named Chattoka. Swiss immigrants moved to New Bern in 1710. It was named after the capital of Switzerland: Bern. "Bern" is bear in the German language, and the flags of both towns have the drawing of a bear.

New Bern is the second oldest town in North Carolina. It was the capital of the North Carolina colonial government and the state capital for a short time until 1792. After the American Revolution, New Bern became rich and quickly developed a rich cultural life. At one time New Bern was called "the Athens of the South." After Raleigh was named as the state capital, New Bern rebuilt its economy with the help of trade routes to the Caribbean and New England. It reached a population of 3,600 in 1815. During the 19th-century Federal period, New Bern was the largest city in North Carolina.

New Bern has four historic districts with homes, stores and churches dating back to the early eighteenth century. Close to the waterfront are more than 164 homes and buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Also nearby are several bed and breakfast inns, hotels, restaurants, banks, antiques stores and specialty shops. Tryon Palace, the home of British governor William Tryon, was built in 1770. It was used as the original state capitol building of newly independent North Carolina. It burned down in the 1790s. People can now visit a replica, built from the original plans and on the original foundation. The Masonic Temple and the Athens Theater are both still very active today. The Masonic Theater is the oldest theater in America in continuous use.

The historic districts also are home to many of the town's 2,000 crape myrtles — New Bern’s official flower — and gardens. The district has flowering dogwoods and azaleas.

Union Point park is where the Neuse and Trent Rivers join. It is the city’s major celebration spot for events such as Neuse River Days and the Fourth of July. In 1979, the local government gave Swiss Bear Downtown Revitalization Corp — a nonprofit corporation of civic leaders — control of the failing downtown area. Today, art galleries, specialty shops, antiques stores, restaurants and inns have changed downtown and the waterfront into a social hub. Improvements are still being made. Built in 1995 through the efforts of Swiss Bear, James Reed Lane is a downtown mini-park and pedestrian walk-through on Pollock Street across from historic Christ Church. Private restoration efforts have returned many of the downtown buildings to their turn-of-the-last-century elegance.


Ecological footprint

An ecological footprint measures how much people take from nature. The footprint is then compared to the amount of natural resources nature can renew. The ecological footprint takes into account how much farmland, grazing land, forest area, and sea area it takes to provide everything people use through carbon dioxide intake. More simply, footprint calculations answer the questions: how much nature do we have? And how much do we use?

When analyzing the world as a whole, humanity is using nature about 1.7 times faster than nature renews itself. It is like using 1.7 planet Earths. Since people consume differently around the world, it is also possible to calculate how many planet it would take if everybody around the world consumed like a particular population. For instance, if everybody consumed like the Germans, it would take nearly 3 planet Earths. Expressed in area: The ecological footprint per world citizen is about 2.8 global average hectares per person while there are only 1.6 global hectare of biologically productive land and water per person on Earth. This means that humanity has already overshot global biocapacity by 70% and now lives unsustainably by depleting stocks of "natural capital"</ref></ref> and running on biocapacity deficits.

After this, it will shift into an ecological reserve because the biocapacity has been exceeded, and will be considered an ecological overshoot.

All this data is based on the 2020 assessment from Global Footprint Network, York University, and FoDaFo. It uses 2017 data.

Environmental impact of aviation

Air travel has a major impact on the world's environment, especially the atmosphere. With fast globalisation, air traffic has quickly increased, and is one of the biggest causes of climate change.

It also takes fuel to fly the planes which causes pollution. Aircraft pollution has increased a great deal although flying or taking a transportation method that can carry more than a few individuals at a time is more environmentally friendly than a smaller vehicle. Aircraft noise can also be a problem. Public awareness of the impact of aircraft on the environment is a lot less compared with automobiles.

Water footprint

A water footprint is the amount of freshwater used by individuals, groups or companies in order to make goods or provide services used by the community. These goods and services may be needed around the entire world. A water footprint can be determined by math for any well-established group of users, or producers. It is measured by dividing the total amount of water used, by the water that became polluted, in the same area during the same amount of time. While the water footprint of an organization is a good indicator for its water consumption and pollution, it does not show how other water sources are affected. More studies will need to be done in order to determine the effect of the water footprint on water sources. 

The water footprint concept was introduced in 2002 by A.Y. Hoekstra from UNESCO-IHE as an alternative indicator of water use. The concept was refined and accounting methods were established with a series of publications from two lead authors A.K. Chapagain and A.Y. Hoekstra from the UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education, now at WWF-UK and University of Twente respectively. The most elaborate publications on how to estimate water footprints are a 2004-report on the 'Water footprint of nations' from UNESCO-IHE and the 2008-book Globalization of Water by A.Y. Hoekstra and A.K. Chapagain, published by Blackwell, 2008. Cooperation between global leading institutions in the field has led to the establishment of the Water Footprint Network in 2008 that aims to coordinate efforts to further develop and disseminate knowledge on water footprint concepts, methods and tools.

Bang!

Bang! is a card game. It is set in the Wild West. It was made by an Italian man named Emiliano Sciarra. This year, there were many expansion packs for the game. With all of them, this game can be played with eight players at the most.

At the beginning of game, every player chooses their character and role. When the player is choosing their character, they take two random cards, looks at special ability and picks one of them. Every character has a different count of lives (from three to five). The sheriff has one more.

There are four roles. Every player knows only their own role. Only the sheriff is known to everybody. Roles are different depending on the number of players:





Each player has a different mission:





After everyone chooses their character and role, the game starts. Every player gets the same number of cards as the number of lives they have, so if a player has three lives, they get three cards. At the beginning of turn, the player takes two cards. There are three kinds of cards. They have brown, blue and green edges. Brown cards allow players to play immediately, blue cards mean a player has to put it on the table first. Green cards also mean this, but the player needs to wait for one lap before he can use the card.

Aspen

Aspens are a type of poplar tree with leaves that move with the slightest wind. The two main species are both called 'trembling aspens' or 'quaking aspens' on account of their leaves.

Some, but not all, are classified by botanists in the section "Populus".

These species are called aspens:


Populus tremuloides is the American aspen. It is common in temperate and colder regions of North America.

It forms large stands (groups) of genetically identical trees (clones) connected by a single underground root system. These trees form through root sprouts coming off an original parent tree. The largest known fully connected aspen is a grove in Utah nicknamed 'Pando', and some experts call it the largest organism in the world, by mass or volume. It covers 0.43 km (106 acres) and is estimated to weigh .

Populus tremula is a species of poplar native to cool temperate regions of Europe and Asia, from the British Isles east to Kamchatka, north to inside the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia and northern Russia, and south to central Spain, Turkey, the Tian Shan mountain system, North Korea, and northern Japan. It also occurs at one site in northwest Africa in Algeria. In the south of its range, it occurs at high altitudes in mountains.

It is a hardy species which tolerates long, cold winters and short summers. Aspen is dioecious, so individual trees are either male or female (in contrast to most trees, where male and female flowers occur on the same tree). Trees flower in March and April, before the leaves appear, with both the male and female trees producing catkins. Pollinated female catkins ripen in early summer and release tiny seeds which are tufted with hairs.

Like other aspens, its main method of reproduction is vegetative (asexual). It spreads extensively by root sprouts, which may be produced up to 40 metres from the parent tree. They form extensive clonal colonies. Large numbers of new shoots can be produced in this way, especially after a major disturbance such as fire.

In 1894, 26-year old Václav Klement (a bookseller in Mladá Boleslav) could not find any spare parts to fix his bicycle. Klement returned his bicycle to the makers, Seidel and Naumann, with a letter. It was written in Czech. The letter asked the company to repair the bicycle. When Klement got his reply, it was in German. It said (in English): "If you would like an answer to your inquiry, you should try writing in a language we can understand". Klement was very unhappy at this. Even though he did not have any experience, he decided to start a bicycle repair shop. He and Václav Laurin opened this in 1895 in Mladá Boleslav. Before working with Klement, Laurin was a bicycle maker in the town of Turnov. Turnov was near to Mladá Boleslav. In 1898, after moving to their newly-built factory, the pair bought a Werner "motorcyclist". It was made by French manufacturer Werner Brothers. Laurin & Klement's first motorcyclette was powered by an engine on the handlebars. It drove the front wheels. It was dangerous and unreliable. Laurin had an accident on it, and lost one of his front teeth. To design a safer motorcycle, the pair wrote to German specialist Robert Bosch for advice. The pair's new motorcycle went on sale in 1899.

In 1900, when the company had 32 people working for them, motorcycles began being exported. 150 machines were shipped to London. Shortly after, the press said that they were the makers of the first motorcycle. The first model, Voiturette A, was a success. The company was set up both within Austria-Hungary and all over the world. By 1905 the company was making automobiles.

After World War I, the Laurin-Klement company began making trucks. However, in 1924, the company looked for a partner after running into problems. It was bought by Škoda Works, a firearms maker. Most things made later were under the Škoda name. Škoda was successful again after an economic depression. The "Popular" in the late 1930s is an example of a popular car.

During World War II, when Nazi Germany had invaded Czechoslovakia, the Škoda works was turned into part of "Reichswerke Hermann Göring". It helped the German war effort.

This table shows the Škoda car models still being made.

Masolino da Panicale

Masolino da Panicale (common name "Tommaso di Cristoforo Fini", born around 1383 in Panicale, died 1447 in Florence) was an Italian painter. He is commonly known as Masolino. Among his best-known works are frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel, and a madonna called Madonna and Child with St. Anne. He painted the madonna together with another artist, commonly known as Masaccio.

"No Debes Jugar" was released in July 1995 by Telemundo and featured live performances of Selena singing the song in their television show "Padrisimo". "Fotos y Recuerdos", which was also released by Telemundo in July, featured home videos of Selena. In August 1995, "I Could Fall in Love" was released, it featured videos and pictures of Selena. The music video for "Dreaming of You" featured an actress playing the role as a lonely and depressed girl packing her clothes to runaway with her boyfriend. Before the girl leaves, the video shows her mother (who is tired of cleaning) heading to the back of the house and looking at the sky at night, while her husband is sleeping. The video's message is telling viewers that they should be with their loved ones because life is too short. 

"Techno Cumbia" featured unreleased scenes of the "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" music video and a group of dancers who danced along with the music. "Tú Sólo Tú", being released in September 1995, featured videos and pictures of Selena. Mariachi Sol de México were featured in the video, they also were the backup singers in the song.

During Selena's tenth death anniversary her brother's band Kumbia Kings released a remix video of "Baila Esta Cumbia" in March 2005.



Rohingya people

The Rohingya are an Aryan ethnic group of Southeast Asia, considered as Gypsy of Burma. They are Muslims. They live in the Arakan State in western Myanmar (or Burma), and in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in south-eastern Bangladesh. They are not citizens of either Burma or Bangladesh.

Starting from 2017, many Rohingya refugees began to arrive in Bangladesh in order to escape the genocide against them in Myanmar.

The Rohingya say that they are native to the region now known as Arakan. They are the product of the mixing of different cultures.

The Rohingya are quite different than other people in Burma. While most people in Burma are Buddhist and speak Burmese, the Rohingya are Muslim and speak the Rohingya language, which is quite similar to the Bengali language spoken in the neighboring country of Bangladesh. Because of these differences, a lot of people look down on the Rohingya and treat them wrong. They are worried that the Rohingya are not loyal to Burma and will try to take over the country, even though Rohingya are outnumbered by other groups.

The Burmese government does not like the Rohingya people. They say that the Rohingya are Bengalis and do not belong in the country. Because of this, Rohingyas cannot do things that other people in Burma can, such as go to school and vote.

In the 2010s, the Burmese government started to put the Rohingya in concentration camps and not allow them to leave. They also took away their ID cards so that they can't say that they were seen as Burmese citizens in the past.

In 2017, the Burmese army started burning down Rohingya villages. They also killed a lot of Rohingya men and said that they were part of terrorist groups. However, most Rohingya are not involved in terrorism and just want to live peaceful lives.

In Bangladesh, a mass-Circumcision, Sünnet like was done for Rohingya Muslim boys

Tanuma Okitsugu

Tanuma was also a daimyo of the Sagara han. He used the title Tonomo-no-kami.

The administration of Tanuma was marked by corruption and by inflation of currency.

In 1784 ("Tenmei" 4), Okitsugu's son was assassinated in front of his father inside Edo Castle. The involvement of senior figures in the "bakufu" was suspected, but only the assassin was punished. The result was that liberal reforms and the relaxation of the national isolation policy "sakoku" were stopped.



Rakhine State

Arakan is a Burmese state on the western coast of Myanmar. It is next to Bangladesh.

The term "Rakhine" may have come from the Pali word "Rakkhapura" from "Rakkhita" meaning the land of the people of Rakhasa (Rakhasa > Rakkha > Rakkhaing > Rakhaing) who were given this name in honor of their preservation of their national heritage and ethics or morality. The word Rakhine means, "one who maintains his own race." In the Rakhine language, the land is called "Rakhinepray", the ethnic Rakhine are called "Rakhinetha".

Arakan, used in British colonial times, is believed to be a Portuguese corruption of the word Rakhine that is still popularly used in English. Many English language users no not use the name changes made by the military government.

Arakanese people

Arakanese is a nationality in Myanmar; they form the majority along the coastal region of present-day Rakhine State or Arakan State. They possibly constitute 5.53% or more of Myanmar's total population but no accurate census figures exist. Arakanese or Rakhine people also live in the southeastern parts of Bangladesh, especially in Chittagong and Barisal Divisions. A group of Arakanese descendants, living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh at least since the 16th century, are known as the Marma people. These Arakanese descendants have been living in that area since the Arakanese kingdom's control of the Chittagong region.

Arakanese descendants spread as far north as Tripura state in India, where their presence dates back to the ascent of the Arakanese kingdom when Tripura was ruled by Arakanese kings. In northeast India, these Arakanese people are referred to as the Mog, while in Bengali, the Marma (the ethnic Arakanese descendants in Bangladesh) and other Arakanese people are referred to as the Magh people.

Tenmei

The "nengō" "Tenmei" means "Heavenly Radiance". The kanji means "dawn" or "daybreak".




Waltari

Waltari is an alternative metal band from Finland. The band was formed in Helsinki in 1986. The original members were Kärtsy Hatakka, Sale Suomalainen and Jariot Lehtinen. Their name is a reference to popular Finish writer Mika Waltari – a favorite author of band’s guitarist Jariot Lethinen. 

Waltari is more famous in the rest of Europe than in Finland and the band members have very positive relationships to Czech Republic. They’ve collaborated with Czech punk rock band Wohnout and Kärtsy is a good friend of Lenka Dusilová. The band has collaborated with many other artists. They’ve made albums with Finnish ethno band Angelit, they hosted on Apocalyptica’s album and Tarja Turunen from Nightwish was a part of Yeah! Yeah! Die! Die! live performance.

Waltari's music is well known for it’s destruction of rock and metal genre boundaries. Their heavy sound is often combined with elements of electronic music, pop, rap, disco, funk, grindcore and bits of many other genres and creates a fusion which can be described as avant-garde. The lead singer and bass guitarist, Kärtsy Hattaka, delivers very distinctive vocal part to their music and makes Waltari's sound even more unique and easily recognizable. 

Waltari’s lyrics are as diverse as their music. They’re about various range of topics including everyday misery, personal struggles, science fiction motives, and music industry philosophical questions. They have one thing in common – heavy irony, self-irony and sarcasm. 

Waltari started their musical career with demo records. The longest one was "Monk Punk". This album presents an interesting mixture of punk and funk music, but the first release which provided the band more positive reviews was the album called "Torcha!" and it was also the first one which combined bits of many musical genres. It also includes the cover of Madonna’s song "Vogue".

Next two albums, "So Fine" and "Big Bang" were also very successful. They mainly concentrate on mixing heavy metal with techno, which was something fresh and innovative. Their biggest success among death metal fans yet came with the "Yeah! Yeah! Die! Die!" album, which is mixture of death metal and classical music. It also has a musical feeling to it, because it’s kind of an epic story from future sung in dialogues of various characters. 

Next album "Space Avenue" is more electronic and it has some pop feeling to it. Another one called "Radium Round" goes even further in that. It’s almost a pop/disco album with some metal elements. Waltari returned to more rock sound with albums like "Rare Species" and very successful "Blood Sample". Last two albums – "Release Date" and "Below Zero" are mainly focused on heavy sound with bits of progressive rock. 


Capitals of Brazil

The capital of Brazil is Brasília, a planned city that was built to be the capital of the country. Before that, Brazil had two other capital cities: Salvador (1549–1763) and Rio de Janeiro (1763–1960).

Salvador was established in 1549 by Thome da Sousa. It became the capital of Brazil.

The city became the seat of the Catholic primate of Brazil.

The Portuguese colonial administration moved south to Rio de Janeiro in 1763. Rio was the capital of the Viceroyalty of Brazil.

In 1807 the Portuguese royal family fled Lisbon when Napoleon I of France invaded Portugal. The Portuguese royal capital was temporarily moved from Europe to Rio de Janeiro.

After the Brazil became an independent nation in 1822, Rio continued to be the capital of the Empire of Brazil.

When the Republic of Brazil was established in 1889, Rio was its capital also.

Brasília became the federal capital on April 21, 1960.

Multiple sclerosis

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a serious health condition that gets worse over time. In this disease, the body’s natural guard against illness (the immune system) damages fatty coverings called myelin sheaths around the nerve cells (neurons) in the central nervous system (CNS). The disease has different effects in different people, and can make people’s bodies, eyesight, speech, and minds work poorly. People with MS do not normally live as long as healthy people.

In healthy people, myelin sheaths help neurons work. Electric signals in neurons move quickly through long, narrow axons like electricity in a wire. The myelin is like the insulator around the wire that keeps the signal strong by keeping it from moving out of the wire before the end. In people with MS, infiltration of immune cells causes inflammation within the CNS resulting in the loss of the protective insulator, called "demyelination." The progressive loss of the myelin sheath, as well as the loss of myelin-producing cells, impair the ability of the body to regrow its myelin. Without the protective covering, the signals between neurons do not travel well. Because of this, the mind and body cannot work like they normally do.

Scientists and doctors do not know for certain the cause of MS, but they think some things put some people at a higher risk for MS:

Research about the causes of MS is still incomplete. Some scientists think that a relatively unknown pathogen called Chlamydia pneumoniae may cause MS. Also, some viruses can cause myelin damage, there are other viruses that have been shown to make people more likely to get MS. Even though scientists and doctors have theories, no one has found one cause that explains every case of the disease.

Quite a few forms of MS exist, which can create difficulty in deciding how to manage the illness. The disease damages myelin. Sometimes, the body can do limited repairs to myelin. When this happens, symptoms (the problems caused by the disease) go away for a short time. This is called remission. When the body attacks the myelin again, the symptoms return and this is called relapse. The type of MS that has remissions and relapses is called Remitting-Relapsing MS. In less common cases, the body continues attacking myelin and the symptoms get worse rapidly, a form called "Primary Progressive MS". Sometimes a combination of the two types of disease can occur simultaneously.

People with MS have many problems. Their muscles are usually weak, they may shake uncontrollably, they have trouble moving, and they have trouble balancing. People with MS often feel a great amount of pain and tire easily. Their speech and sight sometimes become very poor. Thinking and solving problems is more difficult for people with MS than for healthy people.

Inside the body, MS causes damage that cannot be seen or measured without special medical equipment. The immune system attacks either the fatty parts of the myelin or the protein parts of the myelin. The body may also attack the cells that produce the myelin sheath, called glial cells. When myelin is damaged or missing, large areas of axons affected by the damage are visible as scars or lesions in the central nervous system tissue that build up with repeated repair attempts by the body over time. Lesions appear in different areas of the central nervous system depending on what form of MS a person has.

Inflammation is an important part of MS symptoms. Inflammation occurs whenever an injury or illness is detected by the body. It is the first part of an immune system response. In MS patients, inflammation against myelin causes swelling and other harmful effects in the nervous system. Inflammation can happen due to infection by Chlamydia Pneumoniae.

The people who get MS are usually between 20 and 40 years old, although it can happen to older or, very rarely, younger people too. MS is significantly more common in areas of the world that are far away from the equator. Areas far from the equator get less sunlight than areas near the equator, and the human body requires sunlight to make vitamin D for itself. This observation supports the idea that MS is caused partly by too little vitamin D. People who move from one part of the world to another when they are children are more likely to develop MS than people who do not move long distances until later in life or who never move long distances.

To diagnose MS, or to tell if a person has it, a doctor will determine what kind of symptoms are present and how often they occur. The most common guidelines used for this are called the McDonald criteria, which define the symptoms of MS and how often they must occur in order to make a diagnosis. A doctor can also order tests to be done by a laboratory, which can determine how active the immune system is in the patient. A special machine called an MRI can photograph the inside of the central nervous system to show if the person has lesions from damaged myelin. Certain types of neurons can be checked to see how responsive they are. Neurons with damaged myelin around their axons will respond more slowly than normal neurons.

Once a person is diagnosed with MS, a doctor can help ease the symptoms. Scientists have not yet found a way to cure MS, or take it away entirely. The form of MS that comes and goes regularly can be treated more easily than other forms. Some treatments are used only during attacks to make the attacks easier on the patient or to help recovery after the attacks are over. Other treatments are used all the time to help make attacks happen less often. These kinds of treatments are usually injections or infusions directly into veins, but newer treatments can be taken daily by mouth instead. Some people seek other treatments outside of usual medicine, but these have not been shown in scientific studies to be effective.


Adabel Guerrero

Adabel Guerrero is an Argentine professional theatre dancer, actress and "vedette". She is of Ukrainian and Spaniard descent.

Guerrero was in "Dancing with the Stars" in Argentina competing together with professional dancer Martin Whitecamp. They were eliminated by "41.28%" of the public vote.







When asked about her inspiration on dancing Guerrero responded: 

""Julio Bocca, Maximiliano Guerra, Hernán Piquín ... They are the highest in Argentina, each with their own style. Maxi, more manly, more land, and Julio and Piquín more princely, more aerial. There is no first or second, they are different from each other.They have broken their souls to get where they are now.""

Guerrero also says that dance it self is her inspiration:
""To me, dancing transports me, its an absolute passion. Dancing is the best,its orgasmic.""


Walter Raleigh

Sir Walter Raleigh (c. 1554–29 October 1618) was an English aristocrat, writer, poet, soldier, spy, and explorer. He helped make tobacco popular in England, especially among people in the royal court.

Raleigh was born to a Protestant family in East Budleigh, in Devon, the son of Walter Raleigh and Catherine Champernowne. Walter Raleigh was married to a woman called Elizabeth Throckmorten. He had 3 sons named Damerei Raleigh, Walter Raleigh and Carew Raleigh.

In 1594, Raleigh heard of a "City of Gold" in South America and sailed to find it, writing an exaggerated story of his trip in a book. He explored North Carolina all the way down to Florida. This book made people believe in the legend of "El Dorado". After Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, Raleigh was put in prison because he was accused of trying to overthrow King James I, who did not like Raleigh. In 1616, he was released to go look for El Dorado again. This was unsuccessful, and Raleigh's men attacked a Spanish outpost. He returned to England. The Spanish were upset, so to calm them, England arrested Raleigh and executed him by beheading (decapitation) on 29 October 1618.


Rings of Uranus

The rings of Uranus are planetary rings (circles of rock and dust) around the planet Uranus. There are 11 rings in total. In order of increasing distance from Uranus, they are: 1986U2R/ζ, 6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, λ, ε, ν and μ.

Nine rings were found on 10 March 1977 by James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham and Douglas J. Mink. Scientists found two more rings in 1986 in images from the Voyager 2 spacecraft and two outer rings in 2003–2005 in images from the Hubble Space Telescope.

Most of the rings are only a few kilometres wide and are very dark. Most rings are made of rocks 0.2–20 meters wide. But some rings are made of very small dust particles. The closest ring is 38,000 km away from the center of Uranus and the furthest ring is 98,000 km away.

Scientists think that the rings are at not more than 600 million years old. The ring system was created when several moons crashed together. After crashing, the moons broke up into many pieces and made rings.People may discover more rings.

R rating

An R rating is a rating given to multimedia. It usually means that people under the age of 17 require an accompanying parent or adult guardian in order to watch it. The rating means different things in different countries:

Excision (musician)

Excision (real name: Jeff Abel) (born 1986 in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada) is a dubstep DJ and music boss. His signature sound takes influence from the morphing basslines of the drum and bass genre, the aggressive energy of heavy metal, and the laid back vibes of hip hop. Excision is also cited as being one of the first dubstep producers and DJs in North America, he has also played a significant role in the genre's growth in popularity. His first release was in 2007. Excision was asked by Pendulum to remix their 2009 single “Showdown.” His musical recordings from the Shambhala Music Festival in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 have also received over a million downloads which are available for free. He is known to work frequently with fellow Canadian producers Datsik and Downlink. 


Populus

Populus is a genus of trees common in the northern hemisphere. They are often called just poplars. The genus has 25–35 species in three sub-groups, which are called poplars, aspens, and cottonwoods.

In the September 2006 issue of "Science", it was announced that the Western Balsam Poplar ("P. trichocarpa") was the first tree to have its full DNA code sequenced.

The flowers are mostly dioecious (rarely monoecious) and appear in early spring before the leaves. They are borne in long, drooping catkins. The male flowers have a group of 4–60 stamens on a disk. The female flower is a single-celled ovary in a cup-shaped disk.

Pollination is by wind. The fruit is a two to four-valved capsule, green to reddish-brown, mature in mid summer. It contains tiny light brown seeds surrounded by tufts of long, soft, white hairs which help wind dispersal.

Poplars of the cottonwood section are often wetlands or riparian trees. The aspens are among the most important boreal broadleaf trees.

Poplars and aspens are important food plants for the larvae of a large number of Lepidoptera species. "Pleurotus populinus", the aspen oyster mushroom, is found exclusively on dead wood of "Populus" trees in North America.

Equilibrium constant

Equilibrium constant is a mathematical quantity which expresses the relationship between products and reactants of a reaction at equilibrium with respect to a specific unit.It is the reaction quotient of a chemical reaction at chemical equilibrium. The equilibrium constant can help us to understand whether the reaction tends to have a higher concentration of products or reactants at equilibrium. We can also use the equilibrium constant to determine if the reaction is already at equilibrium.

There are several different types of equilibrium constants that provide relationships between the products and the reactants of a chemical reaction at chemical equilibrium in different units. Dissociation constants can be used as an example.

For a general chemical equilibrium
the equilibrium constant can be defined by
where {A} is the activity of the chemical species A, etc. (activity is a dimensionless quantity). It is conventional to put the activities of the products in the numerator and those of the reactants in the denominator.

For equilibria in solution, activity is the product of concentration and activity coefficient. Most chemists determine equilibrium constants in a solution with a high ionic strength. In high strength solutions, the quotient of activity coefficients changes very little. So, the equilibrium constant is defined as a concentration quotient:

Or, 

Here, formula_5 is the partial pressure of formula_6.

If, 

Then,

Here, formula_9 is the equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressure.

In this same process, 

For the reaction above,

So, the relation between formula_12 and formula_9 is,

Here, formula_15 the number of moles of gas on the product side minus the number of moles of gas on the reactant side in the balanced reaction

Edward Durell Stone (March 9, 1902 – August 6, 1978) was an American architect. He is most known for designing buildings with modernist style between 1950-1960s. 








Bashar al-Assad

Bashar al-Assad (born 11 September 1965) is the president of Syria and the head of the Ba'ath Party in Syria. Assad has held these positions since the death of his father Hafez al-Assad (1930-2000), who had ruled Syria since 1971.

Bashar al-Assad was elected in 2000, and re-elected in 2007 with 97% votes.

Assad was born on 11 September 1965 in Damascus, Syria to Hafez al-Assad and Anisa Makhlouf. He had two brothers, Bassel al-Assad and Shabbih Maher al-Assad, and one sister, Bushra al-Assad. Bashar was quiet and reserved and was not interested in politics or the military.

Assad studied medicine at the University of Damascus and graduated in 1988. He then studied ophthalmology at a military hospital, and in 1992 studied at the Western Eye Hospital in London.

His father wanted Assad's elder brother Bassel to succeed him as leader of Syria. Bassel died in a car accident in 1994, and Assad returned home to Syria.

He went to a military academy at Homs, and became a colonel after only five years. He worked as an adviser to his father.

When Bashar's father died, the government changed the constitution. Under Syrian law the president had to be at least 40 years old. With the law changed, Assad was able to be elected President of Syria in June 2000. He was also made commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and leader of the Ba'ath Party which has ruled Syria since 1961.

Large protests began in January 2011. The protesters wanted political reforms, an end to the state of emergency (which had been in place since 1963), and the return of civil rights. The protests in March were the largest to take place, and the government used violence against the protestors.

The United States placed sanctions against the al-Assad government in April 2011. Canada and the European Union also placed sanctions against the government in May 2011.

In June 2011, al-Assad promised reform, a new parliarmentary election, and more freedoms. He also urged refugees to return to Syria.

In January 2012, Reuters claimed that over 5,000 civilians and protesters (including militants) had been killed by the Syrian army, security agents and militia, while 1,100 people had been killed by terrorists.

In January 2012, Assad gave a speech in which he claimed that the uprising was being engineered by foreign countries. He said that a new referendum could be held in March.

The referendum was held in February 2012. The referendum would change the term limits of future Syrian presidents. It passed with 90% support. The U.S. and Turkey did not accept the results. The European Union pushed new sanctions on the government.

In June 2012, the ICRC announced that Syria was in a civil war. The national death toll on both sides reached 20,000.

In 2014 and 2015, he began to lose some support from the Alawite community. This was because an unequal number of soldiers killed in the conflict were Alawites.
In September 2015, Russia got involved in the Syrian Civil War. President of Russia Vladimir Putin said that Russia's goal in Syria is to "stabilis[e] the legitimate power in Syria and creat[e] the conditions for political compromise." In November 2015, Assad said that the two months of Russian intervention had accomplished more than the U.S.-led coalition had done in a year.

In December 2016, government forces recovered most of Aleppo from rebel forces.

After the election of Donald Trump, the U.S. no longer wished to remove Assad from power. That changed after the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack. Donald Trump ordered missile strikes to hit a Syrian airbase. Assad responded by saying that the United States's behaviour was an "unjust and arrogant aggression." He also said that the Syrian army had given up all its chemical weapons in 2013. He claimed that the chemical attack was a lie and was used to justify a U.S. airstrike.

As of March 2018, between 350,000 and 511,000 people have been killed in the civil war.

Assad is married to Asma al-Akhras. Together, they have three children; Hafez, Jr., Zein, and Karim al-Assad.

Influenced by his western education and urban upbringing, Bashar initially seemed eager to implement a cultural revolution in Syria.



Overseas departments of France

France currently has five overseas departments (), which are departments (territorial divisions) that are outside the European part of the country. All are officially part of France, with the same political status as the departments in Europe; and are therefore different to overseas territories. They are also part of the European Union and use the Euro as currency. They are:
Since 2003, these departments are now officially called overseas regions (), but this name has yet to be widely adopted. Each region returns elected representatives to the Senate and National Assembly in Paris. A total of three members are elected to the European Parliament to represent overseas France, including overseas departments and overseas territories. Since 1974, these regions have had their own individual regional councils for local government.

Pope Gregory XI

Pope Gregory XI (; 1331 –27 March 1378), born Pierre Roger de Beaufort, was a French cleric of the Roman Catholic Church and the 202nd Pope from 1370 until his death.

He was the seventh and last of the popes who lived in Avignon in France.

Pierre Roger de Beaufort was born in 1331 in Limousin in France. The Rosier or Roger family were important in Limousin in central France.

Beaufort was a nephew of Pope Clement VI.

Clement VI raised Beaufort to the rank of cardinal in 1348.

Cardinal Beaufort was elected pope in 1370; and he chose to be called Gergory XI. He was ordained as a priest on January 4, 1371; and was crowned pope on the following day, January 5, 13271 

In 1377, Gregory XI was persuaded by Catherine of Siena to return to Rome. He reestablished the papacy in Italy.

Gregory is also remembered as the Pope who condemned John Wycliffe.

When Gregory died on March 27, 1378, the cardinals in Rome elected an Italian-born pope named Urban VI as his successor. 

In Avignon, the cardinals elected a French-born pope who they named Clement VII.

The Western Schism begins with the dispute between the supporters of the Italian-born pope and the French-born pope.


Cantinflas

Mario Fortino Alfonso Moreno Reyes (12 August 1911 – 20 April 1993), known by the stage name Cantinflas (), was a Mexican comedian and stage and movie actor. He often played poor peasants. He became associated with Mexico, and had a long, successful movie career, including some time in Hollywood. Charlie Chaplin once said that Moreno was the best comedian alive, and Moreno has been called the "Charlie Chaplin of Mexico". To audiences in the United States, he is best remembered as costarring with David Niven in "Around the World in 80 Days" (1956).

Moreno also was involved in Mexico's labor politics, which were often dangerous. Although he was a political conservative, his reputation as somebody who spoke for the poor made him seem real, and became important in the early struggle against charrismo, the one-party government's practice of taking over unions.

Carbon diet

Carbon diet is the process of reducing the production of greenhouse gas, primarily carbon dioxide, to reduce effects on climate change and global warming.

Carbon dioxide is produced from heating, driving and consuming products.

The production of carbon dioxide can be reduced by decreasing the intake of carbon, and eventually reduces the effects of climate change.

According to Deborah Jones, her family undergoes carbon diet. They are already in week two of the Globe and Mail assignment. The purpose of this assignment is to see how her family can reduces the emissions of greenhouse gas to reach the provincial goal of 33 percent reduction. It is different from a low carbon diet which is done by choosing what to eat to reduce greenhouse gas discharge.

Carbon is from Latin word carbo "coal" is the chemical element with symbol C and atomic number 6. As a member of group 14 on the periodic table, it is nonmetallic and tetravalent—making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. There are three naturally occurring isotopes, with 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is radioactive, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years.

The term "carbon diet" is used in book Gore:A Political Life. There are steps in carbon diet:

Yuko Kavaguti

Yuko Kavaguti , born November 20, 1981– ), also known as , is a Japanese-Russian Olympic athlete and international ice skating competitor.

In December 2008, she became a Russian citizen and her Russian name is Kavaguti. Kawaguchi gave up her Japanese citizenship. 

Kawaguchi was born in Funabashi, Chiba in Japan. She began skating at the age of five because her mother was a fan of ice dancing. 

She studied international relations at St. Petersburg State University, completing her degree in June 2007. In addition to her native Japanese, she is also fluent in Russian and English. 

In international competition, Kavaguti is pairs skater. She represents Russia with Alexander Smirnov. 

Kavaguti became a Russian citizen so that she would qualify for a spot on the Russian Olympic team. Japan does not allow dual nationality, so she was obliged to give up her Japanese citizenship in order to compete for Russia. 

As a Japanese citizen, Kawaguchi competed as a singles skater. She switched to pairs after the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. 

As a Russian citizen, Kavagui has won many medals, including gold at 2008 Skate Canada International. 

Kavaguti was a partner in the pairs team which won the 2010 European Figure Skating Championships, Kavaguti and Smirnov won the 2010 Cup of Russia, They placed third in the 2010 World Figure Skating Championships.

Boron carbide

Boron carbide is a chemical compound with the formula BC. It is an extremely hard ceramic. It is often used as an abrasive, as armor, as a scratch-proof coating, as a neutron absorber in the control rods of nuclear reactors, and as an additive in the cut-resistant shackle in some padlocks.

Numerical control

Numerical Control (NC) is a way to automate machines. In numerical control, the commands these machines get come from a storage medium; they are not controlled and operated manually. The first such machines were Jacquard looms controlled by punched cards. Machine tools for cutting metal were built in the 1940s and 1950s. They used punched tape instructions. Soon, the tools were changed, to use computers. Numerical control with computers is known as Computer Numerical Control, or CNC.

Nowadays, it is possible to make a program that can run on such machine tools, based on a CAD drawing of the piece to be produced.

Attempts to automate machines in the 19th century, for example copying-lathes, used cams. These are basically wheels that change the position of notches to control a machine. The basic difference to modern NC is that these cams only automated one given task; modern NC and CNC machines can be programmed to a greater extent.

The invention of numerical control has been due to the pioneering works of John T. Parsons in the year 1940, when he tried to generate a curve automatically by milling cutters by providing coordinate motions. In the late 1940s Parsons conceived the method of using punched cards containing coordinate position system to control a machine tool. The machine directed to move in small increments and generate the desired finish. In 1948, Parsons demonstrated this concept to the US Air Force, who sponsored the series of project at laboratories of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). After research MIT was able to demonstrate first NC prototype in 1952 and in the next year they were able to prove the potential applications of the NC.

One of the most usual material types for milling are metals, and there are many to select from.


Bolt cutter

A bolt cutter is a tool that is used for cutting bolts, chains, rebar, padlocks, screws, nails, and many other objects. It is similar to a pair of cutting pliers, but is much larger.

Crowbar

It is used as a lever either to force apart two objects or to remove nails. Crowbars are commonly used to open nailed wooden crates. Common uses for larger crowbars are: removing nails, prying apart boards, and generally breaking things. Crowbars can be used as any of the three lever classes but the curved end is usually used as a first-class lever, and the flat end as a second class lever. In mining, crowbars are used to break blasted rocks and to remove loose rock on roof sides and the working face, but not much in modern mining.

Mid-Atlantic Ridge

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is where seafloor spreading takes place in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. It is part of a world-wide system of mid-ocean ridges. These ridges make up the longest mountain ranges in the world, all underwater except for short stretches like Iceland. On Iceland, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge reaches the surface.

The ridge separates oceanic tectonic plates, and moves the plates apart at about 2.5 cm per year.

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge includes a deep rift valley which runs along the middle of the ridge along almost its entire length. At the rift, the boundary between tectonic plates, magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor. New magma emerges onto the ocean floor near the ridge axis. The crystallized magma forms new crust of basalt and gabbro.

The ridge was discovered during the expedition of HMS "Challenger" in 1872. A team of scientists on board discovered a large rise in the middle of the Atlantic. They were planning the future location for a transatlantic telegraph cable. The existence of such a ridge was confirmed by sonar in 1925

In the 1950s, mapping of the Earth’s ocean floors showed the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to have valleys and ridges. Its central valley is seismologically active and the epicentre of many earthquakes. Ewing and Heezen discovered the ridge to be part of a 40,000-km-long essentially continuous system of mid-ocean ridges on the floors of all the Earth’s oceans. The discovery of this worldwide ridge system led to the theory of seafloor spreading and general acceptance of Wegener's theory of continental drift and expansion as plate tectonics.

The ridge started forming in at the end of the Triassic period, and was responsible for the separation of the Americas from Africa and Europe with the breakup of Pangaea.

The ridge sits atop a geologic feature known as the Mid-Atlantic Rise which is a progressive bulge that runs the length of the Atlantic Ocean, with the ridge resting on the highest point of this linear bulge. This bulge is thought to be caused by upward convective forces in the asthenosphere pushing up the oceanic crust and lithosphere.

Pope Innocent XI

Pope Innocent XI (; 16 May 1611 – 12 August 1689), born Benedetto Odescalchi, was an Italian cleric of the Roman Catholic Church and the 240th Pope from 1676 to 1689.

Benedetto Odescalchi was born at Como in 1611. He was the son of a Como nobleman, Livio Odescalchi

In 1645, Pope Innocent X raised Odescalchi to the rank of cardinal.

In 1650, Odescalchi became Bishop of Novara.

Cardinal Odescalchi was elected pope on 21 September 1676; and he chose to be called Innocent XI.

Pope Innocent was involved in Italian and European political disputes, chiefly with Louis XIV of France
In December 1688, Innocent received the diplomatic mission sent to the Vatican by Narai, the King of Siam.

After Innocent XI in 1689, he was buried in St. Peter's Basilica.

The process of canonization was begun in 1714 and suspended in 1744. Pope Pius XII announced his beatification in 1956.



Surface-area-to-volume ratio

The surface area to volume ratio of an object is the relationship between two measurements. It is the ratio of Surface area to volume. It shows the comparison between the size of the outside of an object and the amount inside. Small or thin objects have a large surface area compared to the volume. This gives them a large ratio of surface to volume. Larger objects have small surface area compared to the volume so they have a small surface area to volume ratio. A large lump, for example, has a small ratio, and may be smashed into powder to give it a large surface to volume ratio.

Two common ways of writing it are sa/vol or SA:V. Either of these say to divide the surface area by the volume. This shows how much surface area is required for each unit of volume. 

Honda Accord

The , also known as the in Japan and China for certain generations, is a midsize car that is built by the Honda company. The car has changed over time by design. It has had ten different basic designs. The Honda Accord has been made and sold since 1976. The car later spawned a station wagon crossover SUV called the Crosstour in 2009. However, very low sales made Honda discontinue the Crosstour in 2015. 

Punched card

A punched card (also punch card or punched-card) is a piece of card stock that stores digital data using punched holes. Punched cards were once common in data processing and the control of automated machines.

Punched cards were widely used in the 20th century, where unit record machines, organized into data processing systems, used punched cards for data input, output, and storage. The IBM 12-row/80-column punched card format came to dominate the industry. Many early digital computers used punched cards as the primary medium for input of both computer programs and data.

Data can be entered onto a punched card using a keypunch.

While punched cards are now obsolete as a storage medium, as of 2012, some voting machines still used punched cards to record votes. Punched cards also had a significant cultural impact in the 20th century.

Metabolism (architecture)

Metabolism is a kind of architecture that began in Japan around 1960. This way of designing buildings came out of the rebuilding of Japan after World War II. Members of the group include: Kiyoshi Awazu, Noboru Kawazoe, Kiyonori Kikutake, Kisho Kurokawa, Fumihiko Maki, Masato Otaka, and Kenzō Tange. They wrote a short book in English and Japanese called ""The proposals for a New Urbanism"" for the World Design Conference in 1960. Many Metabolist projects or designs were very large city plans called "megastructures". The members thought of cities as living things that changed over long periods of time.

These architects were interested in building housing for large numbers of people. They often planned buildings that could be changed. One example is the Nakagin Capsule Tower by Kurokawa (1972). Each apartment was a rectangular block with one round window. These blocks could be added, moved, or removed as needed. It was a ""plug-in building"". Kurokawa planned for new, better capsules to be added to replace old ones. However, the tower was broken apart in 2022.

Nakagin Capsule Tower

The is a building designed by architect Kisho Kurokawa. It has apartments and offices in it. The tower is in Shimbashi, Tokyo, Japan. Nakagin Capsule Tower is an example of the Metabolism style of architecture. It was the first modular capsule building.

The building is actually two towers. One is eleven and the other is thirteen floors. These towers are the utility cores. They have the elevators, stairs, electric, and water services in them. They also support the whole building. 140 capsules are attached to the two cores. Each capsule unit is one apartment or office. They are × × and have one round window. Just four bolts connect each unit to a tower. The units are made from lightweight steel. They were built in Shiga Prefecture and brought to Tokyo on trucks. The capsules are not connected to each other, so any capsule can be removed or replaced without moving the others.

The towers are the permanent part of the building and the capsules were temporary. Kurokawa planned for new units to be built to replace old ones. As building technology improved, better units could be added. Also, units could be changed as people moved in or out. Capsules could even be moved from one building to another. This part of the plan never happened. No new capsules were ever built.

Residents plan to tear down the building. They say there are problems with asbestos and that the building is too old and has not been repaired well. Kurokawa and other architects want to keep the building as an historic example.

The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword

The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is a video game made in 2011 for the Wii. Unlike the other "Legend of Zelda" games, it focuses more on combat, keeping the role-playing and puzzle elements seen in earlier games. The story is connected with the rest of the "Legend of Zelda" series, and this game is about how the master sword was made. The player travels between two worlds: Skyloft, an area in the sky with floating islands which is the main area in the game, and Hyrule, which is located on the Earth. It makes use of the Wii MotionPlus add-on for the Wii Remote. The player uses the Wii Remote to swing Link's sword.

Link is the hero in this game. Zelda is Link's childhood friend, and the heroine in the story. Ghirahim: is the bad person who schemes to revive an ancient evil boss. In this game, you can go to four different "realms", such as the Faron Province, the Elden Province, and the Lanyuru Province, as well as Skyloft.

A limited edition bundle with a gold Wii MotionPlus and a CD with orchestrated versions of the series' well-known music tracks was sold to mark the 25th anniversary of "The Legend of Zelda".

A port, titled The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD, will be released worldwide for the Nintendo Switch on July 16, 2021.

Arab Spring

The Arab Spring (, ) is a wave of protests and demonstrations that happened in the Middle East and North Africa starting on 17 December 2010.  The self-immolation of Tunisian street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi ignited the , which quickly spread all over the MENA region.

Almost all Arab countries were affected by the Arab Spring, through varying degrees of social and political unrest. In Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Bahrein and Syria, the influence of the Arab Spring is the most notable. However, major protests also occurred in many other Middle Eastern states.

People went to protest out of anger against corruption and their often oppressive and authoritarian leaders. The demands of the protester were similar throughout the region. Common demands were freedom, justice, equal rights, economic opportunities, and democracy.

Protestors were very efficient in mobilising people, communicating, and providing information. The methods they used strongly contributed to the course of the Arab Spring. Moreover, pan-Arab TV programmes, social media and other forms of pan-Arab Internet networks contributed to the high degrees of synchronisation of the protests.

The Arab Spring heavily altered the political environment of the Middle East. By 2012, most of the governments involved had either been defeated and replaced or had suppressed the protests. However, in most countries, the demands of the protestors were not met, leaving them discontent and leaving the country in a state of unrest and instability.

On 17 December 2010, the self-immolation of the Tunisian street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi, sparked the .This revolution was the first of many revolutionary protests and demonstrations in the Middle East and North Africa. We know this wave of revolts, protests, and uprisings, as the Arab Spring. Protests occurred all over the Arab World. The Arab Spring resulted in conflicts in Tunisia, Algeria, Jordan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Djibouti, Sudan, Palestine, Iraq, Bahrain, Libya, Kuwait, Morocco, Mauritania, and at the borders of both Lebanon and Israel. 
The outcomes of the Arab Spring differ per country, depending on a variety of factors. Such as the regime's response to the events, the attitude and involvement of security forces, foreign intervention, ethnic and sectarian divisions, and the existing state structure.

In six of the twenty-two states of the Arab League, the Arab Spring dramatically transformed the political environment and led to major political changes. In Tunisia, Libya and Yemen, popular protests forced the authoritarian rulers out of power. In Egypt, this occurred twice. In Bahrain and Syria the demonstrations evolved into civil uprisings. In Syria, the civil uprisings against the regime of Bashar al-Assad led to a full-scale civil war. Civil wars also arose in Libya and Yemen, as a result of the Arab Spring.

Other major protests occurred in Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Morocco and Sudan.

Minor protests occurred in Jordan, Mauritania, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Djibouti, Western Sahara, Palestine and in several non-Arab countries.

There were border clashes in Israel. Protests in Iranian Khuzestan by the Arab minority occurred in 2011. Weapons and Tuareg fighters returning from the Libyan civil war had encouraged a conflict in Mali in North Africa. The clashes in Lebanon were described as a spillover of violence from the Syrian uprising.

The protests of the Arab Spring resembled a 'chain effect'. Many protests all around the Middle East and North Africa arose, following the example of the . Despite the many events related to the Arab Spring, a great number of similarities in the causes of the protests and in the demands of the protestors can be identified.

Five major causes which lead to the Arab Spring, and revolutionary protests in general, are:


Protestors of the Arab Spring took the stree ts out of anger towards their authoritarian, oppressive rulers and the corruption tied to their rule. Demands were generally concerned with freedom, justice, equal rights, economic opportunities, and democracy. These demands were heard all over the MENA region, among all members of society. Participation to the protests exceeded gender, age, religion, and education.

The Arab Spring has been very influential, at least to a great extend because of the methods used by protestors and the high degree of synchronisation of the protests. The protests incorporated some techniques of civil resistance in sustained campaigns such as strikes, demonstrations, marches, and rallies. Protestors were also effective at using social media to organize, communicate, and raise awareness of state attempts at repression and Internet censorship. The protests of the Arab Spring occurred all over the Arab world, despite the different contexts of the different countries, the protests arose almost simultaneously. Four major factors can be identified which contributed to this synchronisation:


The self-immolation of the Tunisian street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi on 17 December 2010 sparked a wave of revolutions and protests, which re-shaped the political environment of the MENA Region. The outcomes of the Arab Spring are of a wide variety and they differ per country. As the context and factors such as the regime's response to the events, the attitude and involvement of security forces, foreign intervention, ethnic and sectarian divisions, and the existing state structure strongly influence the outcomes of the revolutionary events of the Arab Spring.

The Arab Spring is responsible for many changes regarding Middle Eastern society and political structures. In almost all countries of the Arab League, changes occured. However, in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Bahrein and Syria, these changes were more substantial and disturbing, they strongly altered the political environment of these countries.

The Arab Spring began in Tunisia, following the self immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi. In Tunisia, the Arab Spring resulted in a revolution, the , als called the Jasmine Revolution. This revolution began on 17 December 2010, with calls against governmental corruption and economic stagnation, and ended on January 14th, 2011, with the ousting of and his autocratic regime. In Tunisia, the Arab Spring was caused mainly by economic stagnation, lack of political legitimacy, involvement of Tunisian youth and civil society, Islamism, and the growing influence of social media. The overthrow of Ben Ali's regime allowed for more political freedom and democratization in Tunisia. The succes of the Tunisian Revolution ignited many other revolutionary acts in the MENA region.

In Egypt, the protests started on January 25th, 2011, following the Tunisian example. The was influenced by similar factors as the Tunisian Revolution. Egyptians protested against police brutality, the state-of-emergency laws, and economic factors, such as unemployment, agricultural inflation, and low wages. They also demanded more political and civil freedoms.The main goals of the revolution are reflected in one of the main slogans of the protesters, namely “Bread, Freedom, Social Justice and Human Dignity”, relating to the poor political and economic situation of Egypt, characterised by poverty, oppression, corruption, and economic inequality. The Egyptian revolution resulted in the ousting of the Mubarak regime. After the toppling of Mubarak's regime, Egyptian politics remained unstable.

On 27 January 2011 protests commenced in Yemen. Yemeni Protesters initially demanded less unemployment, better economic conditions, an end to governmental corruption, and adjustment to the Yemeni constitution. However, quickly the protesters began demanding the end of Ali Abdullah Saleh's presidency. The predominantly peaceful protests were met with violent responses from the government. On 27 February 2012, President Abdullah Saleh resigned, and democratic presidential elections were held, following a long period of GCC-led diplomatic negotiations.

In Libya, the first protest began on 15 February 2011. The uprisings of the Arab Spring erupted into a civil war, between Muammar al-Gaddafi's regime and the anti-Gaddafi rebels. On March 21st 2011, a NATO-led coalition military intervened in the Libyan Civil War, to protect Libyans against aggression of the government. On 23 August 2011, Muammar al-Gaddafi and his government were overthrown. However, this was followed with a period of great social, political, and military unrest.

14 February 2011 marked the beginning of the Arab Spring in Bahrain. A civil uprising started, despite of the relative high degrees of prosperity and little corruption. The Arab Spring resulted in further polarisation of the Bahraini society, in which sectarian tensions were already high. The uprisings were met violently by the regime, after dialogue had failed. The Sunni-minority regime, supported by the military wing of the GCC, violently regained control over Bahraini society.

In Syria, protests began on March 15th, 2011. Protests were directed against president Bashar al-Assad, who unlike many other Middle Eastern authoritarian leaders was not ousted during the Arab Spring. As the accelerated, governmental responses became increasingly violent and repressive. The Revolution of the Arab Spring transformed into a civil uprising, paving the way for a full-scale civil war, the Syrian civil war. The regime of Bashar al-Assad remains in power, even though opposition and resistance remains. Since 25 March 2011, more than 130 000 people have died and millions have been displaced, both internally and externally.

The term Arab Spring (, ) is used in the media for the revolutionary wave of demonstrations and protests (both non-violent and violent), riots, and civil wars in the Arab world, however, not all participants of the protests were Arab. The first specific use of the term "Arab Spring" to signify these events may have been in the American political journal "Foreign Policy". Marc Lynch, referring to his article in "Foreign Policy", writes "Arab Spring—a term I may have unintentionally coined in a January 6, 2011 article". Joseph Massad on "Al Jazeera" said the term was "part of a US strategy of controlling the movement's aims and goals" and directing it towards American-style liberal democracy. Due to the electoral success of Islamist parties before protests began in many Arab countries, the events have also come to be known as "Islamist Spring" or "Islamist Winter". Moreover, Some observers compared the Arab Spring movements to the Revolutions of 1989 that occurred in Eastern Europe or the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states, which are sometimes also referred to as "Spring" revolutions. :)


Guangzhou

Guangzhou (; ; ) is the capital of Guangdong Province of southern China. Historically, it was known to Westerners as Canton, which is a misnomer, or a mistake in naming, since the name is an older English pronunciation for the entire region that the city is in, Guangdong. It is also called the City of Flowers. It is in the south of China and is one of the five biggest cities in China. In mainland China, Guangzhou is regarded as one of the three most popular cities with Beijing and Shanghai, which is called Bei-Shang-Guang for short. It is where the 16th Asian Games were held and it is famous for its food all over the world.

Guangzhou is the core city of South China. It is on the north of Zhu Jiang Delta (Pearl River Delta), where the Dong Jiang River (East River), Xi Jiang River (West River) and Bei Jiang River (North River) join together. On its South is the South China Sea. With its geographical advantages, Guangzhou has been a very important port in South China for hundreds of years. Today, it is the biggest and most important port for air, sea, and trains in China. The area of Guangzhou is about . The north part and middle part of Guangzhou are hills. The west part and south part are plains that have a lot of rivers and streams. Guangzhou is in the subtropics monsoon climate region. It has a lot of sunshine and rain. The average temperature is from 21.4 to 21.9 °C (about 71 °F) and the lowest temperature in winter is about . The rainy season lasts for almost six months and the typhoons in summer also bring lots of rain. The average humidity is about 77 percent.

Guangzhou has Baiyun Airport, which is one of the three most important parts of air transportation in the country. The passenger throughput ranks third in China and 19th in the world. It is also a very important harbor in China, second to Shenzhen in South China and the fourth one in the country. With the Jing-Guang Railway, Jing-Jiu Railway, Guang-Shen Railway and other railways, Guangzhou has become one of the four biggest railway passenger stations in China. A high speed railway has been built here.

Guangzhou has been the city famous for business for hundreds of years. It has been open to the world for nearly 2000 years. After the Reform and Opening Up in 1979, Guangzhou has gained great economic achievement. For example, Guangzhou's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) has grown about 14% per year. It ranks as the third economic city in China (not including Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao). In addition, Guangzhou has become a city with a sound industrial foundation and developed tertiary-industry. In September of 1993, Guangzhou was accepted as a member of the World Association of Metropolises.

The most important elements of Guangzhou’s economy are light manufacturing sector and foreign trade. They are the main reasons for Guangzhou’s economic achievement and its attraction to appeal people from all over the world to begin their own business in this city. Every year, the China Import and Export Commodities Fair (Guangzhou Fair) is held here. It has the biggest conference and exhibition center, Guangzhou International Convention and Exhibition Center, in Asia. After 2000, Guangzhou began to change its industrial structure and increase its investment in the heavy manufacturing sector. Nowadays, the automobile industry, petrochemical industry, and the IT industry have been the three mainstay industries in Guangzhou.

Guangzhou is a typical city for Lingnan Culture. The main characters of Lingnan Culture are open-mindedness, practical spirit and civilian consciousness. People here don’t adhere to traditional rules. They combine culture from different parts in the world with the local culture and are creating new culture to adjust to the modern world. This is very different from the Center Plains Culture in the north part of China. Guangzhou has its own opera, Guangdong Opera, and its own language, Cantonese. In Guangzhou Metro, you can hear the announcement for station not only in Chinese and English, but also in Cantonese. Besides, sotto portico is the typical construction for Lingnan Culture. A flowers market held every Spring Festival is famous around South China.

The education in Guangzhou began in the Western Han Dynasty. Now, Guangzhou is one of the cities with the most colleges and universities in the South China. It is one of the cities which has the most education resource in the country. The best comprehensive university here is Sun Yat-sen University. It is a university built in memory of Sun Yat-sen, who led the Xinhai Revolution and is regarded as the father of China.

Noriega was born in Mexico City, Mexico, on October 24, 1969. At the age of 12, she was discovered by a talent scout. She started working as a child model and appearing in commercials and music videos. Her father died when Noriega was in her early adolescence. Her mother died in 1995 from cancer. She has two siblings; an older sister, Reyna, and a younger brother, Alejandro. Noriega takes long breaks between projects and avoids publicity. She lives in the United States.

Noriega made her television debut at the age of 14 in the telenovela, "Principessa". Soon after, she appeared in another telenovela, "Juana Iris", and on a comic show, "Cachún cachún ra ra!". In 1986, she got her first leading role in the telenovela "Yesenia" where she played a role of a young gypsy. Shortly after, she starred as a leading character of "Quinceañera". "Quinceañera" is considered to be the first telenovela made for teenagers because it dealt with the problems of youth (drugs, date rape and gangs) for the first time in the television genre. A year later, she appeared in another teen drama, "Dulce Desafío".

In 1993, Noriega signed a contract with the U.S. network, Telemundo, and starred in a successful telenovela, "Guadalupe". In 1995, she moved to Colombia and played the leading role in "Maria Bonita", co-produced by RTI Colombia and Telemundo network. Noriega returned to Mexico in 1997 and starred as the lead of "María Isabel", where she portrayed an indigenous woman. A year after, she played the leading female character in "El Privilegio de Amar", the highest rated television program in Mexico to date.

In 2001, Noriega played the leading role in "El Manantial". In 2003, she portrayed an aristocrat, Matilde Peñalver y Beristáin, in "Amor Real". This historical telenovela received critical acclaim and was highly successful. In 2005, she played the leading role in "La esposa virgen". Her most recent starring role was in the telenovela, "Fuego en la sangre", from 2008.

The following table shows some of the nominations and wins for Adela Noriega.

White rice is rice after the outer part of each grain has been removed.

Gas discharge lamp

Gas discharge lamps are a family of artificial light sources (or lamps). These lamps produce light by sending electricity through an ionized gas. Most of these lamps use a noble gas (usually argon or neon gas), or a combination of noble gases, but they often contain other materials, such as mercury, sodium or metal halides. The gases in these lamps are ionized in operation. This means that there are free electrons. When an electric current is sent through the gas, electrons collide with atoms of the gas and the metals. This will mean that some reach a higher energy state. When they fall back into the lower energy state, they will emit the energy in the form of light. 

The fluorescent lamp is probably the best known gas discharge lamp. Sodium vapor lamps are commonplace as streetlights.

Gas-discharge lamps have a long life and a high efficiency, but they are more complicated to manufacture, which makes them more expensive to buy than incandescent lamps. Due to their greater efficiency, gas-discharge lamps replacing incandescent light bulbs for many purposes in the late 20th century. Early in the 21st century, light-emitting diodes improved, with even higher efficiency. They began to replace some gas discharge lamps. 

Charged particle

A charged particle, also called an ion, is an atom with a positive or negative charge. This happens whenever something called an ionic bond forms. Two particles that have different numbers of electrons (the smallest particle in an atom which is negative) start reacting to each other. The particle that has the greater amount of electrons steals the other particle's electrons. One becomes positive because it lost an electron, and the other negative because it got another electron. The two particles become attracted to each other and mix together, making a new kind of particle.

Germicidal lamp

A Germicidal lamp is a lamp that produces a special type of ultraviolet light. This light can ionise oxygen and produce ozone. Ozone can kill many types of germs. There are different designs of such lamps; some are very similar to compact fluorescent lamps.

Nineveh

Nineveh was an ancient Assyrian city on the eastern side of the Tigris River. It was the capital and a major city of the Assyrian empire. Its ruins are across the river from the modern-day city of Mosul, Iraq.

The ruins of Nineveh are surrounded by the remains of a massive stone and mudbrick wall dating from about 700 BC. The wall was bout 12 km in length. The stone retaining wall had projecting stone towers spaced about every . The stone wall and towers were topped by three-step parapets.

The city wall had fifteen monumental gateways. They were checkpoints for people entering and exiting the city. They probably had barracks and armouries. With the inner and outer doors shut, the gateways were fortresses. The gateways had passages and interior chambers lined with finely cut stone. A stairway led from one of the interior chambers to the top of the mudbrick wall.

The city wall was destroyed by ISIS by February, 2015. The wall was destroyed during an effort to destroy historical buildings and monuments in the province by the jihadist rebel group.

List of most visited art museums in the world

This article lists the most visited art museums in the world. This list of 100 is based on an attendance survey compiled by "The Art Newspaper" published in April 2013.

The country with the highest number of visitors in the top 100 is the United Kingdom. The country with the most museums appearing in the list is the United States.

The list also includes exhibition centers organizing temporary art displays. Several major art museums, such as the Palace Museum in Beijing, which annually draw close to 12 million visitors, the Museo del Prado in Madrid, with 2,800,000 visitors in 2012, and the National Museum of Anthropology of Mexico City, with 1,767,092 visitors in 2011, were not included.

Annual fluctuations occur due to the popularity of special exhibitions and improved collections. For example, the National Gallery of Victoria 2,800,000 visitors in 2017, placing it well into the top 20.

White asbestos

White asbestos, also called chrysotile asbestos or serpentine asbestos, is one of the six types of asbestos. About 95% of asbestos found in buildings is white asbestos. It is considered by experts to be less dangerous than the other types of asbestos, but it is still a major health hazard and exposure can cause cancer and asbestosis.

Pope Innocent XII

Pope Innocent XII (; 13 March 1615 – 27 September 1700), born Antonio Pignatelli, was an Italian cleric of the Roman Catholic Church and the 243rd Pope from 1691 to 1700.

Authors of the Bible

The Bible is a collection of texts that are commonly referred to as books. Many of these books have the name of only one person. There is a controversy about how the texts of these books were fabricated. For example, there is a discussion if all the Pauline epistles have been written by Paul the Apostle.

Big Mama Thornton

Willie Mae "Big Mama" Thornton (November 12, 1926, Montgomery, Alabama – July 25, 1984 in Los Angeles, California) was an American blues singer, harp player and songwriter. 

Thornton was the first who recorded "Hound Dog" by Leiber and Stoller. Another song which is often covered is "Ball ´n Chain". It is included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame list of the "500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll". It is one of her best-known songs because of being performed and recorded by Janis Joplin.

She was born in Montgomery, Alabama. She got her musical education in a Baptist church, where her father was a minister and her mother a choir singer. At the age of 14 she joined Sammy Green's Georgia-based Hot Harlem Revue and toured the south. She was also a self-taught drummer and harmonica player. She often played each instrument onstage.

1948 she settled in Houston. In 1951 she was signing a recording contract with Peacock Records. For this label she recorded "Hound Dog" which became #1 in the Rhythm ´n Blues charts. Then she toured with Junior Parker and Esther Phillips. At the end of the 1950s her career faded. She relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area, where she mostly played local blues clubs.

In 1966 she recorded "Big Mama Thornton With The Muddy Waters Blues Band" featuring Muddy Waters (guitar), Sammy Lawhorn (guitar), James Cotton(harmonica), Otis Spann (piano), Luther Johnson (bass guitar), and Francis Clay (drums). Her "Ball 'n' Chain" album in 1968 with Lightnin' Hopkins (guitar) and Larry Williams (vocals), included the songs "Hound Dog", "Wade in the Water", "Little Red Rooster", "Ball 'n' Chain", "Money Taker", and "Prison Blues".

One of Thornton's last albums was "Jail" (1975) for Vanguard Records.The album was recorded in the mid-1970s at two prisons. She became the leader of a blues ensemble .Thornton performed at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1966 and 1968, and at the San Francisco Blues Festival in 1979. In 1965 she performed with the American Folk Blues Festival package in Europe where she recorded her album "Big Mama Thornton in Europe" and followed it up the next year in San Francisco with "Big Mama Thornton with the Chicago Blues Band". Both albums came out on the Arhoolie label. Thornton continued to record for Vanguard, Mercury, and other small labels in the 1970s and to work the blues festival circuit until her death in 1984. She was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1984.

Thornton died of a heart attack in Los Angeles on 25 July 1984 at the age of 57.

Piano concerto

A piano concerto is a concerto written for piano and orchestra.

A classical piano concerto is often in three movements.


Examples by Mozart and Beethoven follow this model, but there are many others which do not. Beethoven's fourth piano concerto includes a last-movement cadenza, and many composers have made innovations – for example Liszt's single-movement concerti.


Unilineal evolution

Unilineal evolution, also called classical social evolution, was a 19th-century social theory about the evolution of societies and cultures. 

There were different theories by various sociologists and anthropologists. However, they all believed that Western culture is the peak of social evolution. Social status is seen as a single line that goes from most primitive to most civilized. This theory is now generally considered obsolete in universities.

Ōnin

In the "Ōnin" era, the emperor gave Yoshimasa's villa with a special name -- "Higashiyama-dono"., Construction work was interrupted by the Ōnin War.

The "Ōnin" War started in 1467. This conflict is called "Ōnin no ran" because of the nengō in which it began. The fighting began as a dispute over who should follow Ashikaga Yoshimasa as shogun after his retirement – whether it would be his brother (Yoshimi) or his son (Yoshihisa).
Rival groups of daimyo fought for military supremacy. In the end, there was no winner. The war stopped because the factions simply exhausted themselves.

Hurricane Juan (1985)

Hurricane Juan in 1985 was the most costly of all the storms of the hurricane season. It killed about 24 people and caused about $1.5 billion in damage even though it was a weak hurricane. Even though the damage was bad, the name Juan was not removed from the list of hurricane names in the spring of 1986.

Meiō

, also known as Mei-ō, was a after "Entoku" and before "Bunki." This period started in July 1492 and ended in February 1501. During this time, the emperors were and .







Hurricane Hortense

Hurricane Hortense cut across Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico in September of 1996. The storm took next to 40 lives and did $139 million in damage. The storm also affected portions of eastern Canada, striking southeastern Nova Scotia as a Category 1 hurricane. The name Hortense was later retired.

Ballistic coefficient

In ballistics, the ballistic coefficient (BC) of a bullet is a measure of its ability to overcome air resistance in flight. A high BC means it will slow down less. It will have more of its speed left when it reaches the target. BC depends on mass, diameter, and drag coefficient. Ballistic coefficient has units of lb/in² or kg/m². BCs for bullets are normally stated in lb/in² by their manufacturers without mentioning a unit. The values for BC can be as low as 0.12 and as high as 1.00 for commonly used bullets.

A bullet with a high BC will travel farther than one with a low BC since it will keep its speed better, resist the wind better, and “shoot flatter”.

When hunting with a rifle, a higher BC is good for several reasons. A higher BC results in a flatter flight. The effect of mistakes in estimating the distance to the target is smaller for bullet with a higher BC. This is important when attempting an effective hit on an animal. If the target animal is closer than estimated, then the bullet will hit higher than expected. On the other hand, if the animal is further than estimated the bullet will hit lower than expected. Such a difference in bullet drop can make the difference between a clean kill and a wounded animal.

This difference in flight path is more important at longer distances. Sometimes, the difference in two bullet designs fired from the same rifle can result in a difference between the two of over 30 cm (1 foot) at 500 meters (550 yards). A bullet with a high BC arrives at the target faster and with more energy than one with a low BC. Since the higher BC bullet gets to the target faster, it is also less affected by crosswinds.

Sporting bullets have BC’s in the range 0.12 to slightly over 1.00, with high being the most aerodynamic, and low being the least. Very-low-drag bullets with BCs ≥ 1.10 can be designed and produced on special lathes using mono-metal rods. These special bullets often have to be fired from custom made full bore rifles with special barrels.

Bullet makers often offer several weights and types for a given size. Heavy-for-caliber pointed (spitzer) bullets with a boat tail design have high BCs. Lighter bullets with square tails and blunt noses have lower BCs. 

In the United States, hunting cartridges such as the .25-06 Remington (a 6.35 mm caliber), the .270 Winchester (a 6.8 mm caliber), and the .284 Winchester (a 7 mm caliber) are used when high BCs are desired. In the larger sizes, the .338 Lapua Magnum and the .50 BMG are popular with very high BC bullets for shooting beyond 1000 meters. Other choices in the larger size are the .375 and .408 Cheyenne Tactical and the .416 Barrett.

Differences in BC claims for the same projectiles can be explained by differences in the air density used for these BC statements or differing range-speed measurements on which the stated G1 BC averages are based. The BC changes during a projectile's flight and stated BCs are always averages for certain distances and speeds. Some more explanation about the transient nature of a projectile's G1 BC during flight can be found at the external ballistics article. 

To find the correct BC (some scientists would call it drag coefficients), Doppler radar-measurements are required. The normal shooting or aerodynamics person, however, does not have this expensive equipment. Weibel 1000e Doppler radars are used by professional ballisticians, defense forces, and a few ammunition manufacturers to get exact real world data on the flight behavior of projectiles of interest.

Test results came from many shots, not just a single shot. Any single bullet can have a very different BC than another. It is important to know the average behavior of a bullet. 

Most ballistic mathematical models and tables or software assume that one specific drag function correctly describes the drag and hence the flight characteristics of a bullet related to its ballistics coefficient. Those models do not have any differences for wadcutter, flat-based, spitzer, boat-tail, very-low-drag, etc. bullet types or shapes. However, some different drag curve models have been made for several standard projectile shapes.


These free computer programs can be used to calculate ballistic coefficient if other information is known.

Mike Starr (musician)

Michael Christopher "Mike" Starr (April 4, 1966 – March 8, 2011) was an American musician. He is best known as the playing bass guitar in Alice in Chains. 

Starr was an original member of Alice in Chains since they were formed in 1987. Starr left Alice in Chains in 1993 which lead singer Layne Staley said to be "just a difference in priorities. We wanted to continue intense touring and press, Mike was ready to go home.".

Starr appeared on the VH1 television series "Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew" in 2010. 

Police found Starr dead on March 8, 2011. Dr. Drew said that Starr's death was caused from "a prescription-drug overdose."

Dr. Dre

Andre Romelle Young (born February 18, 1965), known professionally as Dr. Dre, is an American rapper and record producer. He has had many records and songs throughout the years and is one of the most famous producers in hip hop. He has made albums with many rappers through their careers, including Snoop Dogg, Eminem, 50 Cent and The Game. As of 2011, "Dr. Dre" is ranked as the third richest rapper by Forbes and is worth two-hundred & fifty million dollars ($250,000,000). Dre began his career in music as a member of the World Class Wreckin' Cru and he later found fame with the gangsta rap group N.W.A. with Eazy-E, Ice Cube, MC Ren, and DJ Yella which made the use of swear words in rap songs in rap to tell about the violence of street life popular. During the 2000s, he produced music for other artists, while sometimes rapping with other artists' on their songs. Dr. Dre signed Eminem to his "Aftermath" record label in 1998 and 50 Cent in 2003 helping to make their albums with them. Rolling Stone magazine said Dr. Dre was one of the richest performers in 2001 and 2004. Dr. Dre was also in movies such as Set It Off, and the 2001 movies The Wash and Training Day.

Because he liked Grandmaster Flash, he often went to a club called The Eve After Dark to see a lot of DJs and rappers performing live. He then became a DJ in the club, at first under the name "Dr. J", his favourite basketball player. At the club, he met DJ Yella for the first time. Soon afterwards he started using the name "Dr. Dre", half his old nickname, and half his first name, also calling himself as the "Master of Mixology". He later joined the musical group World Class Wreckin' Cru in 1984. The group would become stars of the electro-hop scene that was really popular in early 1980s West Coast hip hop, and their first hit "Surgery" would feature Dr. Dre on the turntables and sell 50,000 tapes within Compton. Dr. Dre and DJ Yella also did mixes for local radio stations, making the ratings for it's show "Afternoon Traffic Jam" go higher. Dr. Dre's earliest songs were released in 1994 on a CD called "Concrete Roots". 
He was a diver in high school, but because he skipped school a lot, he was kicked off the team. After high school, he went to Chester Adult School in Compton because his mother told him to get a job or go back to school. After going to a broadcasting school for a little bit, he moved to his father's house, and then his grandparents house before going back to his mother's house. He later dropped out of Chester to focus on performing at the Eve's After Dark nightclub.

In 1986, Dr. Dre met Ice Cube, who with Dr. Dre, made songs for Ruthless Records, a rap record label run by local rapper Eazy-E. N.W.A and fellow West Coast rapper Ice-T are normally said to be the creators of gangsta rap. N.W.A favoured themes and explicit lyrics, offering real descriptions of violent, inner-city streets. With the hit "Fuck tha Police", the group's first full album Straight Outta Compton became a big hit, despite almost no radio airplay or concerts. The FBI sent Eazy-E a warning letter for the song's content.

After Ice Cube left N.W.A in 1989 over money issues, Dr. Dre produced and performed for much of the group's second album Efil4Zaggin (Niggas for life). He also produced tracks for other rap acts on Ruthless Records, including The D.O.C.'s 1989 album "No One Can Do It Better". In 1991, at a party in Hollywood, he slapped Dee Barnes of the TV show Pump it Up, feeling upset about a news report she did about the feud between them and Ice Cube. Dr. Dre was fined $2,500 and given two years' probation and 240 hours of community service, as well as a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement on television.

After an argument with Eazy-E over money, Dre left the group in 1991 under the advice of a friend, The D.O.C. and his bodyguard at the time, Suge Knight. Knight, a known strongman, was able to have Eazy-E release Dre from his contract and, start Death Row Records. In 1992 Dre released his first single with Snoop Dogg; "Deep Cover". Dr. Dre's first album was "The Chronic". Dre brought a new style of rap, both in terms of style and words.

She was the daughter of a singer named Molly Phillips, played by Mackenzie Phillips, and had a brother, age 16, named Jack. Fiona was played by Cara Delizia.

In the series her singer mother homeschools her and they travel around the country by bus. In the series Fi's brother is skeptical of the occult. Their father was obsessed with it but died when Fi was only 3. Later on in the series Fi meets an entity called a will o' the wisp who seems to know her father and gives her information about him. He takes possession of her brother Jack's body in one episode until she expels him by discovering his name and saying it through a computer puzzle based on a hint he gives her. His name is Bricriu. Bricriu in a later episode takes possession of her mother's body and tries to prevent her from meeting a man who knows who killed her father. Bricriu lets slip to her that his allies in the spirit, although not Bricriu himself, murdered her father because of his investigations into their world. He finally meets Fi again in the first episode of season 3 and convinces her to give up interest in the occult in order to protect her family. Fi stopped appearing in the show after that episode. Fi met her father by time traveling to her third year in the episode Fountain. The first two seasons of the show, particularly the second, were dark. In the second season Fi even meets vampires. However, in the third season Disney decided to choose a lighter tone. Also Delizia left the show in the third season so she was replaced by Alex Johnson who played a new character called Annie who replaced Fi.

Carmen Amaya

Carmen Amaya (2 November 1913 – 19 November 1963) was a flamenco dancer and singer, of gypsy origin, born in the Somorrostro slum of Barcelona, Spain. 

She has been called "the greatest Spanish gypsy dancer of her generation". and "the most extrardinary personality of all time in flamenco dance".

She danced from the time she was 4 years old. Accompanied on the guitar by her father, she danced in waterfront bars in Barcelona. A young person who saw her dance as a girl was the Spanish guitarist Sabicas (Agustín Castellón Campos). He later said "I saw her dance and it seemed like something supernatural to me... I never saw anyone dance like her. I don’t know how she did it, I just don’t know!". Sabicas accompanied her for many years. He recorded "Queen of the Gypsies" (1959) and "Flamenco!" with Amaya.

In 1929, she made her debut in Paris, to warm acclaims and admiration of her dancing skill. She moved to America in 1936, where she went on to act in several movies that broke box office records, including the "Romeo and Juliet" adaptation "Los Tarantos", and the short movie "Danzas Gitanas" (Gypsy dances). 

Amaya often danced in trousers rather than the layered skirt traditional for female flamenco dancers. One theory is that she did this to give more scope to her footwork, which was exceptional, and rather like a flamenco male dancer. Apparently, in early flamenco, women did not do so much footwork, and male dancers used to fill in the steps while sitting on chairs, unseen in the wings. Her style has been described as repetitive because she always did the same dances: "Carmen was a fabulous dancer, but limited" (Antonio Ruiz Soler).

She was invited by Franklin Roosevelt to dance in the White House in 1944, and also by Harry S. Truman in 1953.

Amaya is buried in the Cementiri del Sud-Oest on Barcelona's Montjuïc.

In the 1980s they had two hits with "Tuff Enuff" and "Wrap It Up."

In the early 1990s he started a solo career but still played with the Thunderbirds. He is doing more than 200 concerts in a year playing in blues clubs and at Festivals around the world.



Letters to Juliet

Letters to Juliet is a 2010 American romantic comedy-drama movie. It stars Amanda Seyfried, Chris Egan, Vanessa Redgrave, Gael García Bernal, and Franco Nero. This was the final movie directed by Gary Winick before he died of brain cancer. The movie was released in North America and other countries on May 14, 2010. This movie was inspired by the 2006 non-fiction book, "Letters to Juliet", by Lise Friedman and Ceil Friedman.

When Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), a young American, travels to Verona, Italy — the romantic city where Romeo first met Juliet — she meets a group of volunteers who respond to letters written to Juliet. Sophie finds and answers a letter that has been lost for 50 years, and is stunned when its author Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) arrives in Italy with her handsome but overprotective grandson (Christopher Egan) to find the fiance she left decades before.

Enchanted by Claire's quest, Sophie joins them on an adventure through the beautiful hills of Tuscany searching for Claire's long lost Lorenzo. The journey will change their lives forever, as they discover it's never too late to find true love.



John Whitney Hall

John Whitney Hall (September 13, 1916 – October 21, 1997), was an American academic, historian, editor and professor at Yale University. 

Hall was born in Kyoto in 1916. He lived in Japan until he was a teenager. According to his wife, "Being brought up in Japan and by missionaries, he was a very straight-arrow kind of person. There is this kind of missionary feeling, that you must make something of this [life], not just throw it away." 

At Amherst College, he was awarded a degree in 1939. He returned to Japan an instructor in English at Doshisha University in Kyoto until 1941. 

Hall earned his Ph.D. in East Asian languages and literatures from Harvard University in 1950. At Harvard, he became one of the first graduate students to study under Edwin O. Reischauer.

In 1948, Hall began teaching at the University of Michigan.

His earliest book was "Tanuma Okitsugu, 1718-1787". Among other interests, his research focused on the Kamakura period in the history of Japan.

He taught at Yale University until he retired in 1983. Yale's John W. Hall Lecture Series in Japanese Studies was established in his memory.

In a statistical overview derived from writings by and about John Whitney Hall, OCLC/WorldCat encompasses roughly 90+ works in 200+ publications in 8 languages and 10,000+ library holdings



Since 1994, the Association for Asian Studies (AAS) has awarded the John Whitney Hall Book Prize for an English language book published on Japan or Korea.


Zork

Zork was one of the first interactive fiction computer games and a descendant of Colossal Cave Adventure. The first version of "Zork" was written in 1977–1979.

"Zork" was originally MIT hacker slang for an unfinished program. The creators named the completed game "Dungeon", but changed it back to "Zork" after receiving a trademark violation notice from the publisher of "Dungeons & Dragons". Zork has also been adapted to a book series.

Three of the original "Zork" programmers joined with others to found Infocom in 1979. That company adapted "Zork" into "Zork I-III", a trilogy of games for most popular small computers of the era. Personal Software published what would become the first part of the trilogy under the name "Zork" when it was first released in 1980, but Infocom later handled the distribution of that game and their later games. Part of the reason for splitting Zork into three different games was that, at the time, micros did not have enough memory and disk storage to handle the entirety of the original game. In the process, more content was added to Zork to make each game stand on its own. A version of "Zork I" was issued as a hidden 'easter egg' in . It has exactly the same text and rules as the original.

"Zork" is set in "the ruins of an ancient empire lying far underground". The player is a nameless adventurer "who is venturing into this dangerous land in search of wealth and adventure". The goal is to return from the "Great Underground Empire" alive with the treasures, ultimately inheriting the title of Dungeon Master. The dungeons are stocked with many novel creatures, objects and locations, among them grues, zorkmids, and Flood Control Dam #3—all of which are referenced by subsequent Infocom text adventures.

FrobozzCo International is a fictional monopoly from the game. FrobozzCo products are littered throughout all "Zork" games, often with humorous effect.


All these are text-only unless otherwise noted.


After a six year hiatus, the following games were produced:




Battles of Napoleon

Battles of Napoleon is a 1988 computer wargame by Chuck Kroegel and David Landrey released by Strategic Simulations, Inc.. It was released for the Apple II, Commodore 64 and DOS. "Computer Gaming World" gave it a glowing review, calling it "the game that can keep you satisfied, even addicted, for many years to come." The magazine later awarded it as "Wargame of the Year".

Neusis construction

The neusis is a geometric method that was used by ancient Greek mathematicians. At that time, people did not have good rules to measure distances. They did not know algebra. So, they studied geometry by moving fixed length sticks around on a piece of paper.

The neusis construction (from Greek νεῦσις from νεύειν "neuein" "incline towards"; plural: νεύσεις "neuseis") fits a line element of given length ("a") in between two given lines ("l" and "m"), in such a way that the line element, or its extension, passes through a given point "P". That is, one end of the line element has to lie on "l", the other end on "m", while the line element is "inclined" towards "P".

A neusis construction might be performed by means of a 'Neusis Ruler': a marked ruler that is rotatable around the point "P" (this may be done by putting a pin into the point "P" and then pressing the ruler against the pin). In the figure, one end of the ruler is marked with a yellow eye with crosshairs: this is the origin of the scale division on the ruler. A second marking on the ruler (the blue eye) indicates the distance "a" from the origin. The yellow eye is moved along line "l", until the blue eye coincides with line "m". The position of the line element thus found is shown in the figure as a dark blue bar.

Point "P" is called the pole of the neusis, line "l" the directrix, or guiding line, and line "m" the catch line. Length "a" is called the "diastema" (διάστημα; Greek for "distance").
"Neuseis" have been important because they sometimes provide a means to solve geometric problems that are not solvable by means of compass and straightedge alone. Examples are the trisection of any angle in three equal parts, or the construction of a regular heptagon. Mathematicians such as Archimedes of Syracuse (287–212 BC) freely used "neuseis". Slowly, the Greeks stopped using it.

T. L. Heath, the historian of mathematics, thought that the Greek mathematician Oenopides (ca. 440 BC) was the first to put compass and straightedge constructions above "neuseis". Hippocrates of Chios (ca. 430 BC) may have spread the idea that mathematicians should avoid "neuseis" whenever possible. He came from the same island as Oenopides, and was—as far as we know—the first to write a systematically ordered geometry textbook. One hundred years after him, Euclid also said bad things about "neuseis" in his very influential textbook, "The Elements".

The next attack on the neusis came when, from the fourth century BC, Plato's idealism gained ground. Under its influence, a hierarchy of three classes of geometrical constructions was developed. Descending from the "abstract and noble" to the "mechanical and earthly", the three groups were:

In the end, the Greek mathematicians thought that using a neusis was acceptable only when the two other, higher groups of constructions did not offer a solution. Neusis became a kind of last resort that was invoked only when all other, more respectable, methods had failed. Using neusis where other construction methods might have been used, was branded by the late Greek mathematician Pappus of Alexandria (ca. 325 AD) as "a not inconsiderable error".




Eishō

Eishō or Eisho may mean:

Acute accent

The acute accent ( ´ ) is a mark in many written languages. It is usually added above a vowel to show how to say it. Acute accents are sometimes added to consonants too. Sometimes, the acute accent changes the sound of the whole word by giving it stress in a sentence. This accent is part of many modern languages that use Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek alphabets. The acute accent is one of many similar marks called diacritics.

The acute accent was first used in Ancient Greece. It told the speaker when to say a syllable with a high pitch. Another early accent mark was the apex. In Latin the apex marked long vowels.

The acute accent is mainly used to tell readers about the sound of vowels in words. Sometimes it is very important to the meaning because it shows the difference between two similar words. For example, "resume" may mean to start again, but "résumé" is a summary of someone's work and school experience. Some languages use the accent to show the same changes in sounds, but others use it differently. The acute accent may show:

Some languages use the accent to actually make new letters. Both Faroese and Icelandic add the acute accent to all of their vowels to make new letters. These letters, á, í, ó, ú and ý (plus é in Icelandic) are separate letters with different pronunciations. In Turkmen, the letter is a consonant: .

Many languages have borrowed words from French. Many Norwegian words which came from French keep an acute accent. Some examples are: "allé", "kafé", "idé", "komité". Swedish examples include "café" and "resumé" (noun). Examples in English include: "attaché", "canapé", "cliché", "communiqué", "café", "décor", "fiancé", "passé", "toupée" and "touché". However, sometimes writers forget or choose not to use the accent mark.

Some languages such as Arabic, Persian, or Japanese do not use alphabets. Some writers use the acute accent to tell how the words should sound when words from these languages are written in English. This is more common in older books and less common today.

The ISO-8859-1 and Windows-1252 character encodings included "á", "é", "í", "ó", "ú", "ý". They also had how letters and accents looked when they were written as capital letters. Unicode has many more letters with the acute accent.

To make an accented letter in a Microsoft Office software (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.), users hold the key and press the apostrophe key once. Then, let the key go, and press the letter they want.

On Apple Macintosh computers, users press "option-e" and then the vowel. Vowels can also be capitalised. For example, users make á by pressing "option-e" and then 'a'. Pressing "Option-e" and then "Shift-a" makes Á.

On Wikipedia, users make these symbols by clicking on a link in a box. Some other websites work the same way.



Sonitpur district

Sonitpur is a major district of Assam, India.

The name "Sonitpur" as well as "Tezpur" literally means "the city of blood". 
It reminds of the romantic legend of Usha and Anirudha. The legend revolves around Banasura, the great Asura king of ancient Tezpur, his beautiful daughter Usha and her friend Chitralekha. The princess saw a handsome prince in her dreams and fell in love with him. Chitralekha, a talented artist, not only painted his portrait from Usha's description but recognised him to be Aniruddha, the grandson of Lord Krishna and ruler of Dwarka. Using her magical powers, Chitralekha spirited Aniruddha away to the princess' boudoir where the two married each other according to Gandharva rites, without the knowledge of the king. When Banasura learnt of the clandestine romance, he imprisoned Aniruddha, which led to the arrival of Lord Krishna to rescue his grandson. A fierce battle followed and the entire city was drenched in human blood, hence the name Sonitpur or Tezpur, i.e. ‘the city of blood’ . The story of eternal love between Usha and Aniruddha finds expression in many stories, novels, dramas, dance-dramas, movies.

Sir Edward A. Gait ( 1897) had made reference to the nine line inscription of Harjjar Varma in his ‘’A History of Assam.’’ The inscription is the first recorded history of Assam and dates back to 829 A.D. The inscription was found engraved on a massive stone two kms away from Tezpur town near a temple called Rudrapad.
The Salastambha dynasty ruled Kamrupa from 7th century to 10th century. The accurate boundary of their kingdom is debatable. But Darrang was certainly a part of the kingdom. They shifted their capital from Pragjyotishpur to Haruppeswara, or Hatappeswara- the present day Tezpur. The famous King of the dynasty Harjjar Varma, besides other things had excavated a large pond in 70 acres of land, later came to be known as Hajara Pukhuri . The Pal dynasty ruled Haruppeswara till the 12th century. The most famous ruler of the Pal dynasty was Brahmapal.
After the Pal dynasty’ the royal dominance of the Koch Kings in the west and the Ahoms in the east started growing. During the 14th and 15th century a large part of the western bank of Brahmaputra from Singri in the west and Sootea in the east was ruled by the Bara-Bhuyans. The great saint poet Sri Sri Shankardeva belonged to the Bara-Bhuyan family, who settled at Rowta in Darrang District. The Ahom King Suhungmung alias Dihingia Raja occupied the territories of the Bara-Bhuyans on the north in 1505 A.D. The Koch King Biswa Sinha rose to power in 1515 A.D. King Naranarayana who ascended the throne in about 1540 A. D. divided his kingdom into two parts. He had given the eastern part to the son of his brother Chilarai and the western part of the kingdom to his own son Lakshminarayana. But soon after their ascension as kings, fatricidal war broke out and Lakshminarayana sought refuge with the Mughals which eventually led to invasion of Kamrup by the Mughals. Balinarayana, one of the brothers of Pariksitnarayana fled away to Gorgaon to seek the help of the Ahom king Swargadew Pratapsingha. Pratapsingha christened Balinarayana as Dharmanarayana, made him the king of Darrang and declared war against the Mughals (1616-1637 A.D.). The Ahoms defeated the mighty Mughals in the Bharali war and re-occupied Darrang from the Mughals. King Dharmanarayana died in the Singari war in 1638. His son Sundarnarayana ascended the throne and became the king of Darrang.(excluding Tezpur). On the other hand, the Ahoms ruled the eastern part of Darrang ( present Sonitpur) through Kalia Bhomora Borphukan, stationed at Kaliabor. The Ahom Kings resettled many people in the southern part of Brahmaputra.

The British annexed Assam into the Indian British Empire in 1826. After 1826 the Lower Assam and the Central Assam (Darrang, Nagaon and Raha) were made one division which extended up to Biswanath. The division was placed under one Administrative Officer designated as the Principal Assistant to the Commissioner. The Upper Assam portion was left to the native rulers with supervisory control under a British political agent with political headquarters at Biswanath. Captain Neufville was the political agent for Upper Assam. Darrang Division was administered till 1833 from Guwahati.
Darrang was converted into a district and Mangaldai was made the district Headquarter in 1833. But the British shifted the head quarter to Tezpur in 1835. The district comprised of two sub-divisions, Tezpur sadar sub-division and Mangaldoi sub-division with head quarter at Mangaldoi. The District of Darrang was divided in to six Revenue Circles under one Sub-Deputy Collector in each Circle. There was one Transferred area in the district at Charduar. An assistant political officer was posted at Charduar under the Deputy Commissioner who acted as Political Officer.
Tezpur was a small township then. The British developed Tezpur as a small garrison township. Later, tea gardens were set-up throughout the district. The old steamarghat at Jahajghat, the Dak-Bungalow, the then Chummery compound at present Don-Bosco School campus, the Planters Club of Tezpur (Stations Club), the Jahajghat Railway Station, the Church of Ephiphany etc. and many tea gardens are some of the examples of the contributions of the British.

A few years before the birth of the Indian National Congress in Bombay in 1885, the Tezpur Ryot Sabha was formed by a group of enlightened people primarily to protest against the enhancement of land revenue and to ventilate other public grievances .
The Tezpur Ryot Sabha sent Kali Krishna Barkakoti as its delegate to the National Congress in 1885. It had played an active role in early period of the freedom struggle.
The All Assam Student Association formed in 1916 worked in the district under the leadership of Chandra Nath Sarma.
In June, 1921, the Tezpur District Congress Committee was formed under the presidency of Chandra Nath Sarma. In August 1921, Mahatma Gandhi visited Tezpur and recorded his impression of the visit in Young India in the article "From the Bank of Brahmaputra".
In 1934 Mahatma Gandhi visited Tezpur again during the course of Civil Disobedience Movement.
In the final phase of the British Period the Quit India Movement gained momentum with the slogan "Do or Die" in places like Tezpur, Sootea, Gohpur, Dhekiajuli and Jamuguri.

On 10th September 1942, at Gohpur a young girl led a procession of unarmed villagers under Congress flag. She was Kanaklata Barua – a girl from Barangabari village. As soon as Kanaklata unfurled the flag she and her companion Mukunda Kakati were gunned down by the armed Police. The saga of her heroic sacrifice is still remembered with pride. On the same day at Dhekiajuli Police Station eleven unarmed villagers were gunned down by the armed Police while trying to hoist the tri-color at the Police Station - three of them were teen-aged girls- Tileswari, Numali and Khahuli .
Finally, the British era had come to an end on 15th August "1947" when India gained her Independence in the midnight of 14th August.

The administration set up by the British continued even after Independence. Darrang district with head quarter at Tezpur continued as an important district of Assam. 
Towards 1961, Tezpur started to become a center of trade and commerce. A year later, in 1962, war broke out with China. The Chinese Army advanced up to Sessa near Bhalukpung. People started fleeing from their homes. The war left a bitter experience in the minds of the people of the district.
In 1983, Darrang district was divided. Tezpur sadar sub-division was named as Sonitpur district with an outlying Sub-Division at Biswanath Chariali. Mangaldoi sub-division was named as Darrang district.
On 15th August, 2000, another Sub-Division, Gohpur Sub-Division was carved out from the Biswanath Sub-Division.
Two major events in the field of communication and education can be cited as landmarks in post-independence history of the district. The first one being the construction of Kalia Bhomora Bridge and its opening on 14th April,1987, by Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India. The second one is the establishment of a Central University at Napaam named as Tezpur University.

Kōji (Muromachi period)








Velvet Revolution

Velvet Revolution (Czech: sametová revoluce, Slovak: nežná revolúcia) is a name for political changes in Czechoslovakia between November 17 and December 29, 1989. It ended with the fall of the one-party government of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and start of the democratization process. The name "Velvet" was chosen for its softness.

After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia ended the Prague Spring in August 1968, censorship began again and the Communist Party purged many of its members. This event during the 1970s is known as Normalization. Despite these events, the economic situation in Czechoslovakia was better than in other countries of Eastern Bloc (for example in Poland or Hungary).

The Velvet Revolution started at an official event for 50th anniversary of the closing of Czechoslovakian universities on November 17, 1939 by the Nazis in Prague. This event continued after its official end and was violently ended by state police on the street "Národní třída". In following days people organized meetings for protest against the actions of state police. 750-800 thousand people were at one of the biggest protests on November 25.

On November 19, the Civic Forum, the political movement which led the dialogue with the communist government, was created in The Drama Club in Prague. The same day, the movement "Public Against Violence" was created in Bratislava.

On November 27 a general strike took place. On this day there was a protest at Wenceslas Square with 300,000 people. Its main slogan was "Konec vlády jedné strany" - "End of one-part government".

Václav Havel was named as president of Czechoslovakia on December 29, 1989. He was the first non-communist president of Czechoslovakia since 1948.


Infocom

Infocom was a software company, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that produced numerous works of interactive fiction. They also produced one notable business application, a relational database called "Cornerstone". It is also credited for creating the DOS game series Zork. The company bought by Activision in 1986.




Gemology

Gemology or gemmology is the science of dealing with natural and artificial gems and gemstones. It is considered a geoscience and a branch of mineralogy. Some jewelers are trained gemologists and are qualified to identify and evaluate gems.

Didcot power stations

Didcot Power Station refers to a combined coal and oil power plant (Didcot A Power Station) and a natural-gas power plant (Didcot B Power Station) that supply the National Grid. They are right next to one another in the civil parish of Sutton Courtenay, next to the town of Didcot in Oxfordshire (formerly in Berkshire), in the UK. The combined power stations feature a chimney which is one of the taller structures in the United Kingdom, and six hyperbolic cooling towers, which can be seen from much of the surrounding area. Didcot A was closed in 2013 and three cooling towers have been demolished.

This was the first power station here. It is the biggest one with the big cooling towers (that make the cooling water cooler and make lots of steam) that are in two groups. One group is northwest, the other group is southeast. The power station can make up to 2000 megawatts (2000 million watts - an 'average' lightbulb uses only 50 or 60 watts) at any one time. Didcot 'A' mainly burns coal, but can also burn oil, or in some cases gas. This power station can use some biomass such as wood. The fuel (coal, oil and so on) is first ground up in big mills if it is solid (similar to old flour windmills, but powered by electric motors) to give it a large surface area, and is then blown into a large boiler with lots of air. Here it is burnt to make very high pressure steam, which is used to turn a large steam turbine. This turbine is connected to a generator, which makes the electricity that is then sent out on the National Grid. Didcot A was closed in 2013 and has been demolished. There are now (2018) only three of the large cooling towers left.

This is the second power station in Didcot and is run only on gas. It can put out almost 1500 megawatts and uses gas turbines (like in an airplane) and steam turbines (like in the old power station) together to be more efficient. This is called combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT). It has smaller cooling towers that can't be seen as easily, but that make a more obvious cloud that appears to come from the ground. Didcot B is still operating in 2018.

Samgyetang

Samgyetang is Korean ginseng chicken soup. It’s a food commonly eaten during the summer, especially on the three days called ‘bok day’s.

Samgyetang is made of a whole young chicken stuffed with sticky rice, ginseng, jujube, garlic, and ginger. The chicken is “closed” shut and cooked in a soup. The richness of the broth depends on the style of the cook, as is the added ingredients that may be added. Some Samgyetang broths are cooked for hours. This broth is added to the chicken cooking separately to create a very rich soup. Other broths are lighter and clear.

Samgyetang is usually served with salt and pepper, which is put in a small separate dish to dip the meat. Some people like to add the seasoning directly into the soup. It is usually served with kkakdugi (radish kimchi) and some restaurants will offer regular kimchi as well.

Sesame oil

Sesame oil is a vegetable oil made from the sesame plant. It is used a lot in Asian cooking.

The English term sesame traces back to the Arabic "simsim", Coptic "semsem", and early Egyptian "semsent". "Semsent" was listed in the Ebers Papyrus, a 65-feet-long scroll listing ancient herbs and spices discovered by the famous German Egyptologist, Ebers. The earliest recorded use of a spice - sesame seed - comes from an Assyrian myth which claims that the gods drank sesame wine the night before they created the earth. Sesamum indicum, (indicum meaning "from India") is native to the East Indies. Usage dates back to 3000 B.C. the African slaves brought sesame seeds, which they called benné seeds, to America, where they became a popular ingredient in southern dishes. Through the ages, the seeds have been a source of food and oil. Sesame seed oil is still the main source of fat used in cooking in the Near East and Far East.

Good sesame oil has a strong smell when it is opened. The color should be bright brown or gold. It should be kept at . If it is too cold, the oil would be solid and lose its smell. Sesame oil can go bad if it is exposed to air and sunlight. Therefore it is better kept on a shelf or a sideboard. A dark brown bottle is better than a plain one, because the brown one can protect the oil from the sunlight better. The bottle should be closed tightly to keep air out.

Many things affect the price. Oil content is the most important. Usually a bottle of sesame oil has 40~55%. The more oil content it has, the higher price it has. Another element is country of origin. Also if you buy it made from a factory it would cost less than oil made in a country house by a farmer.


Gristmill

A gristmill (usually flour mill in British English) grinds grain into flour. Grist can refer to both the grain that has been separated from its chaff and to the ground grain.

Most old ones are watermills.
They typically have a waterwheel and from 1 to 3 stones for grinding. Some have more. Water pours on to the wheel causing it to spin. This movement causes an axle inside to turn. The axle is connected to a gear which causes the grinding stones to spin. At the top, there is a chute filled with grain. The grain slowly falls through into the grinding stones.

There are different ways to transmit power from the waterwheel to the stones. The simplest method is known as a single-geared drive. Only one set of gears is used to drive a single stone. This arrangement was used since vertical waterwheels were used in gristmills. It was used until the 19th century.

Another method was known as spur-wheel drive. This method used a set of bevelled gears that would drive a horizontal 'spur-wheel', a large gearwheel that would then drive up to 3 or 4 millstones.

Another arrangement was known as a layshaft drive. The waterwheel would drive a horizontal 'layshaft' with gears mounted on it. Each gear would drive one set of stones.

The Kiss (Klimt)

The Kiss or The Lovers is a painting by Gustav Klimt. It was the last painting in Klimt's Gold Period. He painted it in 1907 or 1908. It is one of the most famous paintings in the world.

The Österreichische Galerie Belvedere museum, in the Belvedere palace, in Vienna, Austria is exhibiting the painting.

The painting shows a couple embracing each other with gold leaf on canvas. The man is kissing the woman, who has green hair. Klimt has said he had obsession for the woman with redheads, and it was reflected in the woman in his painting.

The man and woman are on a flowery grassland. According to the psychoanalytical and biological distinction, Klimt expressed them in different ways. The man wearing a robe with black, white and gray rectangles is described in a rough way, while the woman is expressed with the smooth figures such as a circle, a curve, and flowery patterns. Her hair is also combined with flowers; it looks like she is surrounded with flowers. On the contrary, the part outside the couple in the painting is filled with flat patterning which has small gleaming dots. 

"The Kiss" represents fin-de-siècle spirit because it shows a decadence through opulent and sybaritic images. Also, the painting has some styles recalling the arts of other period. Of them, by using gold leaf, the painting reflects medieval "gold-ground" paintings and earlier mosaics, and the spiral patterns in the clothes recall Bronze Age art.

In the Kiss, Klimt portrays woman as the femme fatale who is a beautiful woman attracting men sexually but brings them unhappiness. It is said that the woman modeled for the painting, however, his life companion Emilie Flöge,who participated as the Viennese bohemian (Bohemianism) and fin-de-siecle circles like Klimt.

The painting is 72 inches high and 72 inches wide (180 cm x 180 cm). It is decorated with gold leaf. At the time, people thought the panting was too sexy, even though both people are wearing clothes.

The city of Vienna bought the painting from Klimt before he finished it. It cost 25,000 crowns.

Klimt was a Symbolist artist and this painting was part of his Golden Period. Klimt went to the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, where he saw Byzantine art, which also uses gold. Also, his father and brother were metalworkers. This is another reason why he liked to use gold leaf in paintings like "The Kiss". Japanese prints also affected the way Klimt made the painting.

In 2003, Austria struck a coin with "The Kiss" on one side and Klimt's face on the other.

As of the 21st century, the painting is in the Belvedere Gallery. Hundreds of thousands of people visit it each year.

Asbestosis

Asbestosis is a disease of the lungs caused by inhaling fibers of asbestos. It is not to be confused with mesothelioma, a cancer of the lungs which is also caused by inhaling asbestos fibers. Asbestosis has been the subject of many lawsuits, and many lawyers specialize in asbestosis and mesothelioma.


Mesothelioma

Mesothelioma is a cancer of the "mesothelial" tissue, a membrane that surrounds several cavities inside of the human body, including the lungs. Although mesothelioma has many possible causes, most cases can be traced to asbestos exposure.

Mesothelioma is a deadly form of cancer. Most patients are diagnosed in their 60s and die at around age 70. It is different from asbestosis, another disease caused by asbestos. Mesothelioma has been the subject of many lawsuits.

Annie Raines

Annie Raines (born 3 July 1969 near Boston, Massachusetts) is an American harp player, piano player and singer.

Raines took up the harmonica at the age of 17. She left Antioch College to make a musical career. She was fascinated by the sound of Muddy Waters, Little Walter Jacobs, and Sonny Boy Williamson. She was influenced by this blues master. She began to play on the streets and at local Boston clubs. She went to Chicago where she met and played with Pinetop Perkins and James Cotton. She played in Chicagos blues clubs. During this time she developed a style of her own.

She teamed with guitarist Paul Rishell who introduced her to the country blues tradition.


Carey Bell

Carey Bell (*14 November 1936 in Macon, Mississippi - † 6 May 2007 in Chicago, Illinois) was an American blues musician. He played the harmonica and bass in the Chicago blues style. 
He was born Carey Bell Harrington. As child he liked the music of Louis Jordan. He wanted to play saxophon. The family was to poor to buy one. So he started to play the harmonica. The harmonica is also known as "Mississippi saxophon. He tought himself to play the instrument. Soon Bell heard the music by the blues harmonica greats: DeFord Bailey, Big Walter Horton, Little Walter and Sonny Boy Williamson I and II. At the age of 13 he joined of his pianist godfather with Lovie Lee's blues band.

In September 1956 he went to Chicago where he met Little Walter and his main mentor Big Walter Horton. The tought him some harp playing. To improve the possibility to find a job as musician he learned to play the electric bass. He played bass in several bands . In the late 1960s, he appeared regularly on the west side of Chicago with guitarists Eddie Taylor and Royal Johnson, playing both harmonica and bass. In 1969 Delmark Records released Bells first album "Carey Bell's Blues Harp". In the late 1970s and 1971 Bell played with Muddy Waters. Later he played for Willie Dixon´s Chicago Blues All-Stars. In 1972 he recorded with Big Walter Horton "Big Walter Horton with Carey Bell" for Alligator Records.

During the 1980s Bell continued to record for various labels and to tour. In 1990 Bell recorded with harpists Junior Wells, James Cotton and Billy Branch "Harp Attack"!.. Harp Attack is still one of Alligator Records best selling albums. Although he worked a lot for Alligator his first solo album was "Deep Down" not till 1995. In 1998 he received the Blues Music Award for Traditional Male Artist Of The Year. Second Nature followed in 2004 an album he recorded with his guitarist son Lurrie Bell.

Carey Bell died of heart failure on May 6, 2007, in Chicago, Illinois.



Babi

In Egyptian mythology, Babi, also Baba, was god in the form of a baboon. His name is translated as "Bull of the baboons". This basically means "Alpha male of all baboons" or the chief of the baboons. Because Baboons have many human characteristics, it was believed that they were dead ancestors.
Because baboons were thought to be the dead, Babi was felt to be an underworld deity.

Khepri

Khepri is a god in Egyptian mythology. He is a sun god who is often believed to be the third form of Ra, because of this he has a connection to rebirth. Khepri is the god of scarabs and Dung beetles. Looking at the actions of dung beetles pushing around small balls of dung, it was believed that Khepri was the god who pushed the sun in its orbit.

Appendage

An appendage is a part of animals attached the main body. Many arthropods have appendages on each, or most, of their segments. Millipedes, for example, have many segments, and almost all carry two legs. Insects have exactly six legs, two on each segment of the thorax. Antennae (feelers) attached to their heads are another type of appendage.

Wings, parts of the tail, legs, some mouthparts, external sex organs can all be described as appendages.

Appendages may be uniramous, as in insects and centipedes, where each appendage comprises a single series of segments, or it may be biramous, as in many crustaceans, where each appendage branches into two sections. 

All arthropod appendages are variations of the same basic structure (homologous). Which structure is produced is controlled by homeobox genes. Changes to these genes have allowed scientists to produce animals (such as "Drosophila melanogaster") with modified appendages, such as legs instead of antennae.

Ministry of Defence (UK)

The United Kingdom Ministry of Defence is a Britsh government department headed by the Secretary of State for Defence in the Cabinet. It controls the administration of the British Armed Forces.

The present Ministry is a post-World War II creation, joining the Admiralty, the War Office, the Air Ministry and part of the Ministry of Aviation. Ministers of State supervise each of the three armed services, and a Joint Chiefs of Staff committee is led by the professional heads of the three services.

Terraria

Terraria is an action-adventure/RPG indie game released by independent game studio "Re-Logic" on May 16, 2011. It was originally available on Microsoft Windows, but different ports are available on the Xbox Live, Playstation, Android, iOS, Windows Phone, and 3DS. It is a 2D side-scrolling format, similar to Mario or Mega Man.

It is a wide-open sandbox style game; players may edit the terrain and go anywhere they want to.

There are a wide variety of materials (Called ) that players can use, such as Dirt Blocks, Stone Blocks, Copper Ore, Wood, and many more. Players need the right tools to mine any block. 

The game begins with the player creating a custom character, and then is placed in a computer-generated world. The players begins with only a few Copper tools, which are used to gather wood, mine blocks, and attack monsters. From these basic Copper tools, the player moves up to stronger armor and weapons. There are many bosses in Terraria that the player must defeat. 

To achieve hardmode, the player needs to kill the boss Wall of Flesh in the Underworld biome. After the Wall of Flesh is defeated, there are more bosses that the player can fight. The 3 bosses after the Wall of Flesh are the Twins, Skeletron Prime, and the Destroyer. After the 3 mechanical bosses, the Plantera Bulb will spawn in the underground jungle somewhere. Once the plantera bulb is destroyed, Plantera will spawn. After plantera is defeated, you unlock the key to the Lizhard Temple. The Lizhard Temple is where the Golem boss will have a spawn. Kill the Golem and go to the jungle to see 4 cultists. Kill the 4 cultists and the Lunatic Cultist will spawn. After the Lunatic Cultist has been killed, the 4 Celestial Pillars will spawn. The 4 Celestial Pillars are the Solar Pillar, Nebula Pillar, Vortex Pillar, and Stardust Pillar. After all pillars are defeated, the final boss, the Moon Lord will spawn. 

In Terraria, the music changes depending on which biome/area the player is in. It can also change if the player is fighting a boss, like the Eye of Cthulhu for example.


List of political parties in Azerbaijan

This is a list of political parties in Azerbaijan.

Azerbaijan is a one-party dominant state, meaning that is a system of majority rule where one political party, in this case the ruling New Azerbaijan Party, has successively won election victories by a very large majority and is therefore the dominant ruling party, which does not have to form coalitions (alliances) with other smaller political parties as a result. The one party dominant state differs from a one-party state, because opposition parties against the New Azerbaijan Party are allowed, but are widely considered to have no real chance of gaining power. 





One-party dominant state

The one-party dominant state is a system of majority rule where one political party has successively won election victories by a very large majority and is, therefore, the dominant ruling party, which does not have to form coalitions (alliances) with other smaller political parties as a result. 

The one-party dominant state differs from a one-party state, because opposition parties against the dominant ruling party are allowed, but have no real chance of gaining power. 

Many one-party dominant states are dictatorships where only one party can by law be in control, but some one-party dominant states are real democracies, where there are no limits by law against other parties.

A case of this was Mexico, where Presidential candidates (the person running for this governmental office) of the Institutional Revolutionary Party were popularly elected for more than 70 years. In Sweden and Japan, the ruling party lost at least one election but soon won another and returned to power.

Another example is South Africa, where the African National Congress has been the ruling party of post-apartheid South Africa since the democratization of the country with the election of Nelson Mandela in the 1994, winning every election since then. During the apartheid era, the National Party of South Africa ruled from 1948 to 1994 and imposed apartheid. 

In one-party dominant states that are dictatorships, the ruling party often stays in power through electoral fraud and gerrymandering, and also by suppressing the opposition who don't accept this for moral reasons, which undermines the legitimacy of the ruling party and the system. Russia is an example of this.

O. Henry

O. Henry was the pen name of the American writer William Sydney Porter (September 11, 1862 – June 5, 1910). O. Henry's short stories are well known for their clever twist endings.

His whose tales romanticized the commonplace—in particular the life of ordinary people in New York City. His stories expressed the effect of coincidence on character through humour, grim or ironic, and often had surprise endings, a device that became identified with his name and cost him critical favour when its vogue had passed.

Among his most famous stories are:


Kenneth G. Wilson

Kenneth Geddes Wilson (June 8, 1936 – June 15, 2013) was an American theoretical physicist and Nobel Prize winner.
As an undergraduate at Harvard, he was a Putnam Fellow. He earned his PhD from Caltech in 1961, studying under Murray Gell-Mann. 
He became a junior faculty member in Cornell University Physics Department in 1963. He became a full professor in 1970. In 1974, he became the James A. Weeks Professor of Physics at Cornell. He was a co-winner of the Wolf Prize in physics in 1980, together with Michael E. Fisher and Leo Kadanoff. He got the 1982 Nobel Prize in Physics for combining quantum field theory and the statistical theory of critical phenomena of second-order phase transitions. In other words the prize was for his constructive theory of the renormalization group. In this theory he gave not only important, and even numerical, insights to the field of critical statics and dynamics in statistical physics, but indirectly also basic answers to the question: "What is quantum field theory?" and "What does renormalization mean?". He also gave a constructive answer to another important "renormalization" problem from solid-state physics, the Kondo effect.

He advocated that the federal government should buy supercomputers for science research. In 1985, he was appointed as Cornell's Director of the Center for Theory and Simulation in Science and Engineering (known now as the Cornell Theory Center, one of five national supercomputer center created by the National Science Foundation. Since 1988, Dr. Wilson has been a faculty member at The Ohio State University. His current research interests include physics education research.

Some of his PhD students include Roman Jackiw, Steve Shenker, and Michael Peskin.

Wilson's father was the prominent chemist E. Bright Wilson, and his brother David is also a Professor at Cornell in the department of Molecular Biology and Genetics.

Wilson died on June 19, 2013 from lymphoma in Saco, Maine, aged 77.




Tenshō (Momoyama period)

The "nengō" "Tenshō" means "Heavenly Virtue".

Oda Nobunaga suggested that a new era should begin in 1573. The general meaning of Tenshō was "heavenly righteousness".


In 1589-1590 (in the 23rd year of the reign of King Seonjo of Joseon), a diplomatic mission led by Hwang Yun-gil was sent to Japan. The Joseon ambassador was received by Hideyoshi.

The fictional plot of the classic Akira Kurosawa film "The Seven Samurai" takes place in the 15th year of "Tenshō".



Tensho

Tensho may mean:

Bunroku

The "nengō" "Bunroku" means "Enlightened Benevolence".


Land reform and a general census of the population and a national survey are undertaken in 1589-1595.


Marcos de Niza

Fray Marcos de Niza (– March 25, 1558) was a Franciscan friar. He was born in Nice ("de Niza" means "of Nice" in Spanish), which was at that time under the control of the Italian House of Savoy. He went to America in 1531, and explored the area above Sonora.

Apex (diacritic)

In written Latin, the apex (plural: "apices") is a diacritic. It is close to the shape of an acute accent ( ´ ). The apex is used to show that a vowel is long and not short. That means that the vowel is pronounced for longer.

The shape and length of the apex can be different. It can even sometimes be different within the same writing. While pretty much all apices are made up of a line sloping up to the right, the line can be more or less curved, and is different in length from less than half the height of a letter to more than the height of a letter. Sometimes, it is put at the top with a hook, pointing out to the left. Rather than being centered over the vowel it changes, the apex is often drawn to the right.

Later, it developed into the acute accent, which is still used in some languages to mark vowel length. In particular, Czech and Slovak, Hungarian, Irish, and (a long time ago) Icelandic.

Although not really known by some modern Latinists, the sign was actually used a lot during classical and postclassical times. The reason why it is not usually noticed is probably because of its smallish size and the fact that it is usually quite thin. People who look carefully will soon start to notice apices in the exhibits of any museum, not only in many of the more formal epigraphic writings, but also in handwritten palaeographic things.

Forgetting the apex, modern Latin spelling has recently started marking long vowels by using the macron. The macron is a sign that had always been used, and still is, to mark metrically long "syllables" (more recently called "heavy" syllables). This has caused confusion between syllable and vowel length in Latin, and most western dictionaries still cannot describe the nature of Latin vowels properly because of this. To make even more confusion, the acute accent is sometimes used in Latin to mark stressed syllables, just like in Spanish, when the macron is not used.

The apex is often thought to be the opposite of another ancient Latin diacritic, the sicilicus, which is said to have been used above "consonants" to show that they should be pronounced as doubles. However, in his article "Apex and Sicilicus", Revilo P. Oliver says that they are the same sign, a "geminationis nota". This was used over any letter to show that the letter should be read twice. 

If Revilo P. Oliver is right, the apex as a sign showing vowel length would have been made in the time when long vowels were written double. Then, when long vowels were not regularly written twice. 

However, Oliver's view that the two marks were the same has recently been challenged.


Acute

Acute can mean:


Differential geometry

Differential geometry is a field of mathematics. It uses differential and integral calculus as well as linear algebra to study problems of geometry. The theory of the plane, as well as curves and surfaces in Euclidean space are the basis of this study. Big discoveries were made in the 18th and 19th century. In geometry, the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. Carl Friedrich Gauß wondered whether triangle bearings of ships really has a sum of angles of exactly 180 degrees; with this question he was among the pioneers of modern differential geometry.

A long time ago, differential geometry was used for map projections. Today, it is used for fields as diverse as general relativity theory, or satellite navigation. Grigori Perelman's proof of the Poincaré conjecture uses differential geometry.

New Azerbaijan Party

The New Azerbaijan Party ("Yeni Azərbaycan Partiyası", YAP) is the ruling political party in Azerbaijan since 1993.

It was formed on 18 December 1992 by the former President of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev, who led it until his retirement and death in 2003. It is now led by his son, Ilham Aliyev, who succeeded his father as the party leader and as President of Azerbaijan since 31 October 2003. The founder of the party, Heydar Aliyev, was a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union until July 1991 before the collapse of the Soviet Union and the independence of Azerbaijan later that year. The headquarters of the party is in the capital city Baku.

The party's stated ideologies are lawfulness, secularism, and Azerbaijani nationalism. It wants to build a "social-oriented" economy, meaning a middle path between socialism and "laissez-faire" capitalism (a mixed economy), and lists civil solidarity and social justice as the basis of its ideology.




Tonga at the Olympics

Tonga has been in seven Olympic Summer Games. They have never been in the Winter Games. 

Tonga was the smallest independent nation to win an Olympic medal. Super Heavyweight Boxer Paea Wolfgram won a silver medal in the 1996 Summer Olympics.

Tonga wanted to enter a delegation for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The Tonga Amateur Sports Association (TASA) said they had one athlete to compete in the luge event. In December 2008, two male athletes were selected to travel to Germany for training, but only one of them would be at the Olympics. Bruno Banani was selected as Tonga's candidate. He failed to qualify by crashing in the final round of qualifications.




Forgery

Forgery is producing a fake document, signature, banknote, or work of art in order to deceive. It is illegal, as it is fraud. Forging money and certain other items is called counterfeiting. 

Crazyracing Kartrider

Crazyracing Kartrider () is an online computer racing game. Nexon opened a beta version of this game in 2004. There are various kinds of karts and items that you can use in this game. The game has three major modes. In item mode, players can use items such as missiles, water balls, shields, bananas, and devils. In a speed mode, players use a booster. In flag mode, players try to bring back a flag to your team zone.

It is easy to play. Only arrow keys and Ctrl, Alt keys are needed to control your kart. Decorating and changing your character and kart is another interesting part of this game. Lucci is game money. You can get it by racing. You need Lucci to buy a kart, or character accessories.

Recently Nexon launched Kartrider Rush to Apple App store. Kartrider Rush is minimized version of Crazyracing Kartrider.



Hanok

A hanok is a type of house. It is built in a traditional Korean style of architecture.

The main feature of a hanok is that it has combination of ondol, the Korean under-floor heating system, and wooden floor for heating and cooling. This style is mainly used in Korea because of problems caused by the area having both a continental climate and an oceanic climate.

Hanoks have different shapes in different parts of Korea. In the northern part of the Korean peninsula, hanoks have the structure of a house with several wings. The wings are often built in either a square or the letter L. This helps keep the wind out of the house in the colder northern places and helps keep the house warm. These kind of house also has low roofs. In the warmer southern Korean peninsula, hanoks have a single wing and a wooden floor. This helps let the air in and out.

The hanoks is also different based on the class of the people who live it. Hanok of upper class people usually have tiled roofs (called "giwa") while lower class houses have roofs made of rice-straw (called "choga"). Hanok for the upper-class people are built not only to be homes, but also to be very ornamental.

A cappella

A cappella music is music where people sing without instruments.

In a choir, there are up to 5 parts: soprano, alto, tenor, baritone, and bass. A cappella can also have those 5 parts. A difference is with percussion. With musical instruments, percussion is done with musical instruments that you hit, such as drums. In an a cappella performance, a person makes the percussion sound. For a beatbox performance, performers make sounds like electric drums, synthesizer and electric guitar. Another part of percussion in a cappella performance is making classical drum sounds for tapping the beat.

The word a cappella is Italian for "in the manner of the church" or "in the manner of the chapel". It was first used in religious music. Gregorian chant is an example of a cappella singing.

For the first 1000 years of Christianity, all hymns in the church were sung without instrumental accompaniment. This style of singing came to be known as a cappella, meaning "of the church" or "in the style of the church".

There are several kinds of music in a cappella, such as barbershop, classical, contemporary, gospel, doo-wop, jazz, and world.

A barbershop group has 4 people. The name of this genre came from the tradition that when many men gathered in a barbershop they would sing with no musical instruments. A barbershop quartet has four male voices or four female voices. Mixed barbershop quartets are also possible, usually with two male and two female voices. The voices parts are called bass, baritone, lead, and tenor. In music in the barbershop style, the melody (the "tune") is sung by the lead part.

In classical a cappella, people perform classical music such as 'a Turkish march', 'Overture William Tell', madrigal, etc.

Contemporary is the most popular kind of a cappella these days. For this kind, the "bass" line should be stronger, and the "chorus" (all the singers except for bass, percussion, and solo) should have variety. The percussion should make their sound more like drums. This genre is similar to 'doo-wop' but the "chorus" part is more complex and has a variety of sound effects.

Doo-wop is also getting more popular because of its simple style. Even though it has simple moto (Italian for "progression of music"), it can be interesting with great vocal and chorus.



Boxer briefs

Boxer briefs are men's underwear. They are tight like briefs but still have long legs like boxer shorts. They are popular and are worn by lots of teenagers and young men. They are sometimes called retropants, retros or retro shorts. They are are fashionable men's underwear that, unlike boxer shorts, are not cut wide, but rather fit snugly on the skin. That keeps the penis and testicles from moving and bouncing a lot, which some men find uncomfortable. The name retros is used because the cut or style comes from underwear styles from the 1950s or even earlier. Boxer briefs reversed the trend from the 1960s through the 1980s in which the popular cuts (styles) of underwear and swimwear became smaller and smaller, especially for teenagers and younger men. 

Boxer briefs are usually made of soft material and can be made in different colours. Some boxer briefs have an opening with buttons on the front. Others just have an elastic waistband and can be pulled on or off like briefs. The waistband is often a separate piece of elastic and is sometimes in a color. Some boxer briefs have elastic at the end of the legs, and stitching across the bottom. Waistband elastics with the brand name in large letters are sometimes worn with pants (trousers) hanging lower on the hips than the elastic so that the brand name is showing. Pants (trousers) that hang lower on the hips than the underwear elastic are called saggers and the style is called sagging or, in some countries, "low-riding". Having the elastic showing was a style some boys, teenagers and young men liked. It started in the late 1980s but sometimes came back into fashion in later decades. 

Some looser styles of boxer briefs offer a compromise or middle option between very snug boxer briefs and lightweight, loose-fitting boxer shorts.

Genna

The "nengō" "Genna" means "Commencement of Concord".




Spanking

Spanking is hitting the buttocks or cheeks or similar of another person to cause them pain. Spanking usually means hitting the buttocks of another person with an open hand. Parents in some countries spank children and teenagers to punish them. 

In some other countries this is no longer allowed. Parents often hope that spanking will make the children obey them. From the past up to the present day, adults have spanked boys more than they have spanked girls.

When a parent spanks their child, they usually strike the child's buttocks with their open hand. Sometimes they use other objects such as a belt or a wooden spoon. At times the child's buttocks may be clothed. At other times they may be bare. Often the parent makes the child lie across their lap. At other times, a parent might tell a child or teenager to bend over or lie face down across a bed. 

When children are asked how they feel when their parents spank them, many say that it makes them feel sad, angry, and afraid. Some young children in the United Kingdom whose parents spanked them said things like, "“it feels like someone banged you with a hammer”" and "“it hurts and it’s painful inside – it’s like breaking your bones”". 

The American Academy of Pediatrics is a group of medical doctors who work with children. They say that spanking is not a good way to help children learn how to behave. They say that it can easily injure a small child. They say that spanking can lead to child abuse. They say that parents should never spank a child with an object.

Some groups of people have said that spanking is violent and goes against human rights. They are people like lawyers, social workers, and politicians. Spanking a person under the age of 18 is now against the law in more than 40 countries. Some of those countries are Brazil, Germany, Israel, Argentina, Sweden, Netherlands, Spain, Poland, New Zealand, Kenya, and Costa Rica.

Dr. Elizabeth T. Gershoff is a scientist who studies spanking. She says that research done over many years shows that spanking does not work. She says that spanking does not teach children good behavior or to obey their parents. She says that children who are spanked obey their parents less as time goes on. Dr. Gershoff said that spanking is "violent" and should be stopped. In 2012, a group of Canadian scientists also looked at many years of research and found that spanking does not work. They said that over time, spanked children become more aggressive. Murray Straus is another scientist studying spanking of children. He has said that there is new research showing that spanked children commit more crimes when they grow up. He said that this was so even if their parents were "loving" to them.

A small number of scientists have claimed that ordinary spanking does no harm. Other scientists say that "over 100" studies have shown that spanking can harm children. They say that spanking harms children's mental growth. They also say that children who are spanked grow up to have more mental illnesses. They say that no study has shown any good to come from spanking. Scientists at the University of Manitoba in Canada found that children who were hit even "sometimes" suffered more mental illnesses when they grew up. They could have different kinds of mental illnesses: long-lasting sad or discouraged feelings and a loss of pleasure and interest in life (depression), a lot of fear and worry (anxiety), racing thoughts that are hard to control and acting without thinking (mania), or a need to take drugs or alcohol to feel well (drug and alcohol abuse). Other scientists have discovered that spanking children often can make their brains grow less than they should. These children end up less able to think clearly. They also try to hurt others more.

Children were always allowed more freedom in some countries, and that includes freedom from physical punishment. This goes with views as to the nature of children. In general, children from some Mediterranean countries such as Italy got more freedom than they did in northern countries.

Ragunan Zoo

Ragunan Zoo is a 140-hectare (350-acre) zoo in Pasar Minggu, South Jakarta, Indonesia. It was founded in 1864. The zoo has over 295 species of animals, 171 species of flora and 3,122 animal specimens including birds.

Ragunan Zoo is a combination of a zoo and park, so it is also known as Ragunan Zoological Park. It holds a lot of Indonesian species such as komodo dragon, orangutan, tapir, anoa, sumatran tiger, Javan Hawk-eagle and various colored birds like the southern cassowary. Other popular animals are sumatran elephant, kangaroo, giraffe, and zebra.

Green chemistry

Green chemistry (or sustainable chemistry) is a type of chemical research and engineering. It supports the design of products and processes that use as little dangerous substances as they can. 

Environmental chemistry is the chemistry of the natural environment and of pollutant chemicals in nature. But green chemistry wants to reduce and prevent pollution at its source. In 1990, the Pollution Prevention Act was passed in the United States. This law sought original and new ways to handle pollution. It aims to avoid problems before they happen.

Green chemistry applies organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, analytical chemistry and even physical chemistry. While green chemistry seems to focus on just industrial applications, it does apply to any chemistry choice. Green chemists reduce the hazards and increase the efficiency of any chemical choice. It is distinct from environmental chemistry which focuses on chemical phenomena in the environment.

1. Prevent waste

Create products without or with minimal wastes so that the wastes do not need to be taken care of afterwards.

2. Design safer chemicals and products

Design chemicals to have little or no toxicity, without affecting effectiveness.

3. Design less hazardous chemical synthesis

Design a way of synthesising products without it being toxic to humans or the environment.

4. Use renewable raw materials

Use renewable raw materials, like plant materials, other than depleting ones, such as Fossil fuels.

5. Use catalysts, not stoichiometric reagents

Use of catalysts because of their ability to be able to be reused and that they are less harmful than reagents.

6. Avoid chemical derivatives

Chemical derivatives generate wastes that can be avoided.

7. Maximize atom economy

Make sure that a greater percentage of the atoms present in the reactants of a chemical reaction are used in the products that are also usable.

8. Use safer solvents and reaction conditions

Avoid using harsh solvents, but if that cannot be avoided, then use benign chemicals.

9. Increase energy efficiency

Use the normal ambient temperature and pressure wherever possible.

10. Design for degradation

Design materials to breakdown into benign substances by bacterial or other environmentally sound ways.

11. Analyse in real time to prevent pollution

Monitor and control the formation of by-products during a reaction.

12. Minimize the potential for accidents

Design chemicals to minimize the potential for accidents.


Toastmasters International

Toastmasters International is a global educational organization which helps to improve English speaking skills and communication. In each club, members are led by the Toastmasters Manual to speak in front of an audience fluently, to think quickly and to react confidently.

The first Toastmasters club opened on October 22, 1924, at Santa Ana, California, United States by Ralph C. Smedley. It was called Smedley Club Number 1. Today there are over 13,000 clubs in 116 countries.

A typical Toastmasters club is made up of 20 - 30 people who gather weekly throughout the year. The club meetings last for about two hours and there are many roles. The meetings generally consist of the following:


Anyone age 18 and above and who pays a fee can join the club and improve his/her speaking and communication skills.

Roles:

The Competent Communication Manual is a basic manual for Toastmasters. Members follow it to present ten speeches. Each of the ten topics is dedicated to improving one of the speaker’s basic skills. The skills are:


After completing all ten speeches the member gets a globally recognized certificate and he/she can continue strengthening his/her skills with the Advanced Communication Manuals.

Memristor

A memristor, or memory resistor, is described as one of the basic elements (resistor, capacitor, inductor) of electronic circuits, because it can’t be replaced by any combination of these elements. 

A memristor can change its resistivity according to the voltage, but even after disconnection it remembers resistivity for unlimited time. It can work like analog memory or a resistive switch, which can have an infinite number of states.

Professor Leon Chua mathematically described this element in 1971.
In 2008 scientists from HP labs described a material that appeared to be a good candidate to construct the hypothetical memristor.

The fourth element can change its conductivity by the voltage, and after power interruption the amount of the resistivity stays the same. No combination of the other three circuit elements can replace a memristor. Only the memristor allows reconfiguring properties so it allows changing a whole electronic circuit. Analogy behaviour is similar to synapses in the brain.

Memristors have great potential for use in computers. For example, computers today have to boot from hard drives because the data is erased from operating memory immediately after shutting down the computer. The process of booting takes much time and energy. Memristors could be used for loading data quicker because it remembers data even after power interruption. Therefore, Memristors could be used to speed the booting process.

The first products using Memristor technology are expected to become available in 2013.



Geostationary orbit

A geostationary orbit (or Geostationary Earth Orbit - GEO) is a type of geosynchronous orbit directly above the Earth's equator (0° latitude). Like all geosynchronous orbits, it has a period (time for one orbit) that is 24 hours. This means it goes around the Earth as fast as the Earth spins, and so it appears to stay above the same spot all the time. A person watching from Earth sees a satellite in a geostationary orbit as not moving, at a steady place in the sky.

Communications satellites and weather satellites often use these orbits, so that the satellite antennas that communicate with them do not have to move to track them. The ground atennas can be pointed permanently at a fixed position in the sky. This is cheaper and easier than having a satellite dish that is always moving to track a satellite. Each one stays above the equator at a set longitude (distance east or west).

The idea of a geosynchronous satellite for communication was first published in 1928 (but not widely so) by Herman Potočnik. The idea of a geostationary orbit became well known first in a 1945 paper called "Extra-Terrestrial Relays — Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?" by the British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, published in "Wireless World" magazine. The orbit, which Clarke first described as good for broadcast and relay communications satellites, is sometimes called the Clarke Orbit. Named after the author, the Clarke Belt is this part of space above the Earth - about above sea level, over the equator, where near-geostationary orbits may be implemented. The Clarke Orbit (another name for a geostationary orbit) is about around.

The satellite orbits in the direction of the Earth's rotation, producing an orbital period equal to the Earth's period of rotation, known as the sidereal day (very nearly 24 hours).

The orbit needs to be above the equator. Since all orbits are around the center of the Earth, if it was tipped above the equator (so that the satellite was straight above New York City, for example) it would need to swing an equal distance to the south pole on each orbit. It needs to spend an equal amount of time on each side of the equator. So if it is directly above the equator, it doesn't move north or south at all. (Geosynchronous orbits are like geostationary orbits, but also include those that go above and below the equator).

The height of the orbit is an exact distance, because the speed of the orbit depends on how far it is from the center of the Earth. An orbit is a balance between centripetal force against the Earth's gravity. Objects closer to Earth feel more gravity. This is why objects in low orbit (like the International Space Station orbit the Earth very quickly, about 90 minutes or so for each orbit. Objects farther away take longer for each orbit. The moon for instance, takes about 29 days for each orbit.

Because this orbit is so high, it takes radio (and light) waves about 1/4 second to go up to the satellite and back to Earth. This means that a broadcast interview taking place between the television station and a distant reporter can have a gap of a half second (1/4 second to go from the studio to the reporter, and a 1/4 second back to the studio, where the signal is then sent to viewer). This half second delay can be noticed in many news broadcasts.

When satellites reach the end of their life, it would be too expensive to bring them all the way back down to Earth to burn up in the atmosphere. It is much cheaper to put them a little higher (300 km) in a 'graveyard' orbit, where they will stay essentially forever.


Weevil

Weevils are herbivorous beetles. They have a long 'snout' at the front of their head, called a "rostrum". Weevils are a family, the Curculionidae, which may be the largest beetle family, with about 45,000+ named living species. That makes it the largest family in the animal kingdom. In addition, the superfamily Curculionoidea has ten more families of closely related weevil-type beetles.

The family has some pests which damage plants of interest to humans. The most famous weevil is the boll weevil, which ruins cotton crops.

The "Ips" genus, feeding on Ponderosa pine, introduces a fungus to the tree. The fungus blocks resin canals, which leaves the weevil free to eat. Resin would normally wash the insects out; it is a defence mechanism. The fungus often kills the tree, and groups of dead trees are a focus for forest fires. In this way the insect is indirectly responsible for serious fires.

The maize weevil, "Sitophilus zeamais", is a major pest. It attacks both standing crops and stored cereal products, including wheat, rice, sorghum, oats, barley, rye, buckwheat, peas, and cottonseed.


Over 100 new species of weevil have been found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.

4D

4D, meaning the common 4 dimensions, is a concept in mathematics. It has been studied by mathematicians and philosophers since the 18th century. Mathematicians who studied four-dimension space in the 19th century include Möbius, Schläfi, Bernhard Riemann, and Charles Howard Hinton.

In geometry, the fourth dimension is related to the other three dimensions of length, width, and depth by imagining another direction through space. Just as the dimension of depth can be added to a square to create a cube, a fourth dimension can be added to a cube to create a tesseract.

By analogy, the universe of a 2D (two dimensional) being is a plane, but this plane may curved into a sphere. This means that if a two dimensional object goes forever forward in a straight line, the object will end up in the same position it started from. So, applying this idea to three dimensions, we can say that our universe is curved into a fourth dimension. Thus, if a three dimensional object walks forever in a straight line, the object will end up in its starting point. 

Going into theoretical physics, if we look with a large enough magnification into a point in our universe, it may be possible to see how the universe was (its size in light years) many years ago. As the observable universe now is 93 billion light years long and the Big Bang, theoretically, began approximately 14 billion years ago. Will it be possible to see how our universe was before the Big Bang (if there was a universe at all)?

4D is also an important idea in physics, developed in the 20th century. In physics, it refers to the idea of time as a fourth dimension, added to the (3D) spatial dimensions. Albert Einstein developed the idea of spacetime by connecting space and time together. The difference is that spacetime is not a Euclidean space, but instead is called "Minkowski spacetime".



Profiling

Profiling is collecting information about someone in order to describe them and/or predict their behaviour and actions. It is often used for criminals or people believed to behaving illegally. More recently used on employees in the work place to improve success

A basic profile consists of an all points bulletin (APB). It is a visual description based on eyewitness information. 

A psychological profile is created in the absence of eyewitness information, or in addition to, using evidence to create a picture of the suspect and help the police force to understand how the suspect is behaving.

Predictive profiling attempts to predict which people might commit crimes in the future.

Criminal profiling – criminal profiling is a tool used by police forces to create a picture or idea of a suspect based on eyewitness information and any other evidence they have.

Some people fear profiling is taken too far by police forces and can lead to harassment and arrest based on skin colour, religious beliefs, culture, nation of origin, or any social type or group that can be stereotyped by characteristic behaviour. 

Behavioural profiling is used in business to help recruit the right person for a job, to understand how to improve morale and to drive down staff turnover, pinpoint who is ready for development and in precisely which areas; and boost people management abilities.

Kula ring

Kula is a traditional trade method that takes place in the Milne Bay Province of Papua New Guinea.

The Kula Exchange takes place on eighteen islands, including the Trobriand Islands, and involves thousands of people. The traders involved travel by canoe over hundreds of miles to exchange their Kula valuables. These valuables can be in the form of red shells that are traded to the North of the Islands, or in the form of white-shell armbands, which travel to the South of the Islands. Therefore creating a ‘ring’ of moving valuables throughout the islands. The terms of trade change in different regions. For example, some traders have to exchange a white armband for a necklace or must trade a red shell for a white shell armband. There are also differences on who can take part in the trading process such as in the Trobriand Islands their chiefs mainly take part in the exchange process, whereas in Dobu, anyone can take part. 

The Kula valuables are mainly traded for social status and recognition in the Island region. The people that an individual trades with become trusted trade partners, creating a strong, potentially life-long relationship between the exchange parties. These relationships need trust to be provided on both sides of the trade and also a mutual agreement of safety and support for each other. 

Kula valuables are usually passed on to their trade partners after a certain amount of time, therefore the valuables are always moving around the Kula Ring. The person who originally owned the valuable has full ownership and rights over the item, so he can keep it, sell it or even break it. Every person who therefore receives the item, does not fully own it, as there is always a true owner. This creates a sense of responsibility over how the object is handled by other traders toward the original owner. However, the original owner is sometimes unknown, lost in the Kula Ring.

The ability to take part in the Kula Exchange is not immediately given to just anyone. An individual must “buy” into the system by getting involved in lower trade circles than the Kula. 

The Kula valuables are rated by value and age and so are the relationships created through their exchange. Traders will often try to collect valuable and notorious Kula objects that will boost the status of the trader’s name in the Kula Ring. Kula Exchange is based on trust, strong social obligations and the cultural value system. Those who hold on too long to their Kula valuables gain a bad reputation in the system.

The Kula Exchange system determines many social hierarchies and authoritative positions among the trade islands. For example the chiefs living on the Trobriand Islands in the 1970s owned the most shells and also the most valuable shells. Therefore they were responsible for most of the organization and direction of the trade systems in their region. (The Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea (1988) by Annette B. Weiner) Also, the ten most influential men among all the islands control about 90 per cent of the Kula items. With this amount of control and competition, relationships between traders become fragile and ruined by manipulation and deceit. (Malinowski, B. (1920). "Kula; the Circulating Exchange of Valuables in the Archipelagoes of Eastern New Guinea". Man (Man, Vol. 20) 20: 97–105).


Fa’afafine

In Samoa, androphilic males (males sexually attracted to men) are referred to as fa’afafine. Translated into English, fa’afafine means “"in the manner of a woman".” Most self-identify as fa’afafine, not as men.

There are myths outside of Samoa that Fa'afafine are selected to be raised as females when a family does not have enough sons, however evidence shows they are recognised for their feminine behavior early in their lives. Evidence indicates that Fa'afafine are the equivalent to feminine androphilic men in the west (typically these are gay men in western culture).

They take on the role of both male and female in the society e.g. teaching, construction and also domestic work. They tend to have sexual intercourse with masculine males, however rarely with another fa’afafine.


Maslenitsa

Maslenitsa is one of the most popular and cheerful religious holidays in Russia. It originated from pagan times before Russia was converted to Christianity. At first, this holiday was a symbol of the spring solstice but nowadays it is considered a Christian holiday which goes right before the Great Lent. During Maslenitsa people enjoy almost any food, except meat. Usually Maslenitsa lasts for seven days and on the last day of this holiday people burn a doll which is made of branches and straw and dressed in bright clothes. This doll is called “Maslenitsa” and it symbolizes the cold and severe winter. By burning “Maslenitsa” people say goodbye to winter and greet a warm spring.

Every day of Maslenitsa plays a great role. On Monday people greet the holiday with games such as sledding, snowballs, riding on swings and so on. Russian people believe that happiness and joy which they feel during this day will accompany them throughout a year. On Tuesday people play games and bake pancakes which are called "blini". Blini are the most popular food which is made during this holiday. These pancakes have a round form and symbolize the Sun and warmth. On Wednesday people usually visit their friends and relatives and treat each other with blini. On Thursday by tradition people try to drive away winter by riding on horses around the village or around the places they live. Friday is usually called “Mothers’-in-law evenings” because sons-in-law come to visit their mothers-in-law. On merry Saturday everyone goes to visit their relatives. All people drink and eat as much as they want and play different games. Sunday is the last day of the holiday. It is also called the "Sunday of forgiveness" because on this day everyone asks forgiveness from relatives and friends for offences and mistakes committed against them. The most appropriate answer is “God will forgive”. After that people usually sing songs, dance and at the end of the day they burn the doll.

Maslenitsa is also considered as a family holiday because spring is a symbol of new life. People who marry during this time are considered as very strong and happy couples who will give a birth to many children. During Maslenitsa some people even “punish” those who did not marry yet by throwing them into snow.

Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II

The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is a family of single-seat, single-engine, fifth generation multirole Fighter aircraft under development to perform ground attack, reconnaissance, and air defense missions with stealth capability.

The development of the F-35 has been very controversial. Many people feel like the US Air Force has been spending too much money on the F-35 project, and that the government should halt all development of the project.

F-35A - Land Based, Stealth.

F-35B-STOVL (Short Takeoff Vertical Landing), Stealth, External Hardpoints (Optional)

F-35C - Carrier Based, Stealth, External Hardpoints (Optional)

The Blues Band

The Blues Band is a British blues band. The band was formed in 1979 by veteran musicians of British blues of the 1960s.

The band was formed in 1979. 

In the 1960s Paul Jones and Tom McGuinness played for Manfred Mann. Jones worked also as actor and radio DJ.As a harmonica man, he has performed publicly and/or recorded with Memphis Slim, Alexis Korner, Henry Gray, Alvin "Youngblood" Hart, Susan Tedeschi, Eric Bibb and Otis Grand. Hughie Flint was the drummer of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Together with McGuinness he later formed McGuiness Flint who had a hit with "When I´m dead and gone". Dave Kelly was guitarist in the John Dummer Blues Band and in the touring bands of Howlin' Wolf and John Lee Hooker. They played together mostly in London pubs just for fun about playing rhythm ´n blues.

Their first album ""The Official Blues Band Bootleg Album"" raised no interest with record labels, so they sold it during concerts and via mail order. The record was a fine mixture of blues standards and own songs. Arista signed with the band and the album reached #40 in the charts. 1982 Hughie Flint left the band and was replaced by Rob Townsend. In 1983 they parted but they came together soon.

When not playing with the Blues Band Jones, McGuinness and Townsend are playing with ""The Manfreds"". The band can be seen as the 1960s Manfred Mann Band without the leader. Dave Kelly plays often with his ""The Dave Kelly Band"".

By playing a lot of concerts all over Europe they had and still have a lot of fans. Till present they recorded over 20 albums. It is said, that three generations of a family can be seen in their concerts.



Acute (medicine)

In medicine, an acute disease or condition either happens for a short time, as in acute infection, or doesn't last long. The word acute may often be confused by the general public to mean 'severe'. This is different: something can be acute but not severe.

The word "acute" is in the name of many diseases, for example, severe acute respiratory syndrome or acute leukemia.

Acute hospitals are hospitals which are meant for short-term medical and/or surgical treatment and care. The related medical speciality is called acute medicine. 

Subacute is described as between acute and chronic. An example is subacute fever symptoms or subacute endocarditis.


Toxicity

Toxicity is the degree to which a substance can damage an organism. It is the subject-matter of toxicology.

A central idea in toxicology is that almost everything is toxic when taken to excess. Effects are dose-dependent: even water can lead to 'water intoxication' when taken in too much. For even a very toxic substance such as elapid snake venom there is a dose below which there is no toxic effect. 

Toxicity is species-specific. A dose which is toxic to one animal may not be toxic to another.

Acute toxicity describes the bad effects of a substance that come either from a single exposure, or from many exposures in a short amount of time (usually less than 24 hours). To be known as "acute" toxicity, the bad effects should happen within 14 days of the substance thouching something.

Acute toxicity is different from chronic toxicity. Chronic toxicity talks about the bad health effects from many exposures, often at lower levels, to a substance over a longer amount of time (months or years).

It is widely thought to be wrong to use humans as tests for acute (or chronic) toxicity research. However, some information can be picked up from investigating cases when humans accidentally make contact with the substance (e.g., factory accidents). Otherwise, most acute toxicity data comes from animal testing or, more recently, "in vitro" testing methods and inference from data on similar substances.

Kan'ei

The "nengō" "Kan'ei" means "Permanent Liberality".


Hayashi Razan and his son wrote "Kan'ei shoka kezuden" in 1641-1643. The shogun ordered the writing of this history of the great clans of Japan.



Protostar

Protostar is an early stage in the evolution of a star that usually grows to the point of beginning nuclear fusion and becoming a star by gathering mass. It is made of a contracting cloud of cold and dark interstellar medium (mostly hydrogen gas). Protostars has lower temperature than an ordinary star. For a sun-like star, deuterium fusion occurs in the protostar stage, while proton-proton fusion, which sustains stars for billions of years, starts gradually millions of years later. The modern picture of protostars was first suggested by Chushiro Hayashi in 1966.

Although outer space may seem empty, it is actually full of thinly spread gas and dust called the interstellar medium. Higher density regions form clouds, or nebulas, where star formation takes place. The gas is mostly molecules of hydrogen, so these nebulae are called molecular clouds. The largest molecular clouds have densities of 100 particles per cm3, diameters of 100 light-years (9.5×1014 km), and masses up to 6 million solar masses, and an average interior temperature of 10 K. This is cold and dense compared to elsewhere in space, but would be considered a vacuum on Earth. With low temperatures and high densities, gravity can overcome thermal pressure and start the gravitational collapse that will form a star. 

Sometimes the formation of stars can be triggered (known as triggered star formation) by disturbances in the gas clouds. Such disturbances could be a shock wave from the explosion of a nearby massive star at its death, or the passage of the cloud through regions of more intense gravity as found in the spiral arms of spiral galaxies. This compress the gas clouds enough to cause gravitationally collapse.

When gravity begins to pull the gases together into a ball, a protostar forms. This process is known as accretion.

According to the law of conservation of angular momentum, a rotating body spins more rapidly as it decreases in size. So, as a protostar shrinks, its rate of spin increases. As the protostar rotates, it is much easier for material to fall right onto the poles (which spin most slowly) than onto the equator (where material moves around most rapidly). Therefore, gas and dust falling in toward the protostar’s equator are “held back” by the rotation and form a whirling extended disk around the equator. The circumstellar disks are where planets form.

When a protostar rotates, it generates a strong magnetic field which generates a strong protostellar wind (an outward flow of particles into space). Many protostars also send out high-speed jets of gas into space. Usually there are two jets flowing out along the rotation axis of the protostar. Eventually the wind and the jets clear away the extra gas around the protostar and allow the protostar and the disk to come into view.

As a protostar collapses it heats up because the gas particles run into each other. The energy the gas particles had from falling to the force of gravity gets converted to heat energy. The gas clump becomes warm enough to radiate energy. The radiation cross the interstellar dust in the surrounding dense core. The dust absorbs all impinging photons and reradiates them at longer wavelengths (infrared). 

A protostar has lower temperature than an ordinary star. At its center, hydrogen-1 is not yet fusing with itself. However, theoretically, deuterium fuses with hydrogen-1 at its centre and creates helium-3. The heat from this fusion reaction tends to inflate the protostar, and thereby helps determine the size of the youngest observed pre-main-sequence stars.

A protostar becomes a main sequence star when its core temperature exceeds 10 million K (the temperature needed for hydrogen fusion to operate efficiently).

Collapse into a star like our Sun takes about 50 million years. The collapse of a very high mass protostar might take only a million years while smaller stars can take more than a hundred million years to form.

A protostar with less than 0.08 solar masses never reaches the 10 million K temperature needed for efficient hydrogen fusion. In these cases, a protostar remains as a brown dwarf.

Fresca

Fresca is a drink produced by Coca-Cola Company. It is made of citrus. The drink is similar to Squirt from 7UP company.

Bank of Japan

The , also known as , is the central bank of Japan. The main offices of the bank are in Chuo, Tokyo.

Matsukata Masayoshi founded the Bank of Japan in 1882 ("Meiji 15"). The bank was adapted from a Belgian banking model.

Changes based on other national banks were made part of bank regulations. BOJ was given a monopoly on controlling Japan's money supply in 1884.

The Bank of Japan issued its banknotes in 1885 ("Meiji 18"). In 1897, Japan joined the gold standard.

The Bank of Japan is headquartered in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, on the site of a former gold mint (the Kinza). It is near the Tokyo's Ginza district The Neo-baroque Bank of Japan building in Tokyo was designed by Tatsuno Kingo in 1896.




1938 New England hurricane

The 1938 New England Hurricane was an extremely damaging and highly deadly Atlantic tropical cyclone which struck Long Island, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont with strong winds of Category 4 hurricane level. The hurricane did not curve out to sea like hurricanes usually do. The 1938 storm caused over 300 million in property damage (1938 USD) and killed between 682 and 800 people. Tropical cyclones were not given human names at the time, so the 1938 storm had a number instead.

Darrell K. Sweet

Darrell K. Sweet (August 15, 1934 – December 5, 2011) was an American artist. He mostly painted landscapes and pictures for stories. He was well known for painting the cover art for science fiction and fantasy novels. Sweet was nominated for a Hugo Award in 1983.

Sweet was born in Highland Park, New Jersey. He studied fine arts at Syracuse University and graduated in 1956. Sweet was famous for making the covers of the fantasy books in the Robert Jordan series "The Wheel of Time". He also illustrated covers for the popular "Xanth" series by Piers Anthony, the "Saga of Recluce" by L. E. Modesitt, Jr. and the "Runelords" series by David Farland. Sweet painted the original cover art for Stephen R. Donaldson's series "The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever".

Sweet produced over 3,000 images between 1975 and 2005. He died in 2011. He was 77 years old.


Reanimation

Reanimation a 2002 album by American rock band Linkin Park. It is the first remix album and the fourth album overall by the band. The album is a follow-up to their first studio album, "Hybrid Theory". It was released on 30 July 2002. The album was recorded during the band's "Hybrid Theory" tour in 2001. It features hip hop and electronic-influenced remixes of songs from "Hybrid Theory".




Axum

Axum or Aksum is a town in northern Ethiopia. It was the original capital of the Kingdom of Aksum. Axum is located in the Tigray Region near the base of the Adwa mountains. 

Pygmalion

Pygmalion is a play by George Bernard Shaw.

A street girl selling flowers, Eliza, meets Professor Higgins. Higgins was writing down her pronunciation for his study, but Eliza thought he was a policeman and caused trouble. Higgins says he can make her a duchess by changing her pronunciation. Later she remembers what he said and goes to learn pronunciation with a desire to be an upper class woman. 

Higgins decides to do an experiment with her. He deceives all the people at a party by making them believe that she is a duchess. After this success, Higgins suggests two options for Eliza. One is marrying based on her beauty. The other is running a flower shop with money from Colonel Pickering who is a rich man. Eliza refuses to do both of them and she leaves his home. Higgins and Colonel Pickering look for Eliza as soon as they know that she left. They find her in Mrs. Higgins’ house but Eliza refuses to go back. She says she will marry Freddy.

George Bernard Shaw is famous for giving audiences a twist by not doing what they expect. In comedy, people expect someone in a bad situation to be in a better one at the end. They expect a poor woman to marry a rich man. They expect a villain to be punished. In "Pygmalion", the flower girl in the bad situation gets better in the end. This girl selling flowers on the street rises to the upper class through changing her language. However, contrary to the audience's expectation, romance between flower girl and Professor Higgins doesn’t happen. She doesn’t marry a rich man. Shaw reflected his beliefs to reform the society in this play.

In the 20th century, there were many poor people on the street. Especially little girls worked all day for a tiny amount of money. The author had much interest in poor people and women’s freedom. And he believed speech was one of the things that separated rich and poor people. That is the starting point of "Pygmalion". He used the change of language as a means to rise to the upper class.

In mythology, Pygmalion was a sculptor who did not like women. He could not find a woman to love. And he decided to make a statue, Galatea. In the play, Pygmalion is compared to Professor Higgins. And Galatea is compared to Eliza. Pygmalion made Galatea to be his ideal woman. And Professor Higgins changed Eliza into a perfect upper class woman. He taught her everything from how to talk to how to behave in front of people. This process of making Eliza an upper class woman is criticized as playing with a live doll, as though she didn’t have her own soul. Higgins treats her as an object.

The common expectation of audiences that women’s fate is determined by men is criticized. It is because of Eliza’s reaction after the success of pretending to be a duchess. She thought the two options suggested by Higgins would be selling herself. When she was selling flowers, at least she didn’t have to sell herself. She doesn’t want to rely on a rich man, but decides to marry a poor man, Freddy. She says she can make something of him. She values love more than anything else.

Virginia Cooperative Extension

Virginia Cooperative Extension provides resources and educational outreach to more than seven million Virginia residents in the areas of agriculture and natural resources, family and consumer sciences, community viability, and 4-H youth development. The federal government started cooperative extension programs in each state with the Smith-Lever Act of 1914. Virginia’s two land-grant universities: Virginia Tech and Virginia State University run the program. The program has faculty and staff at the two universities, 107 county and city offices, 11 agricultural research and Extension centers, and six 4-H educational centers.



Mosaic (genetics)

In genetics, a mosaic (or mosaicism) means the presence of two different genotypes in an individual which developed from a single fertilized egg. As a result, the individual has two or more genetically different cell lines derived from a single zygote. 

Mosaicism may result from:

The phenomenon was discovered by Curt Stern. In 1936, he demonstrated that recombination, normal in meiosis, can also take place in mitosis. When it does, it results in somatic (body) mosaics. These are organisms which contain two or more genetically distinct types of tissue.

People who have mosaicism are often called chimeras but this is a mistake. A mosaic is originally from a single fertilised egg, whereas a chimaera comes from two fertilised eggs.

This is easiest to see with eye colours. When eye colours vary between the two eyes, or within one or both eyes, the condition is called "heterochromia iridis" (= 'different coloured iris'). It can have many different causes, both genetic and accidental. For example, David Bowie has the appearance of different eye colours due to an injury that caused one pupil to be permanently dilated.

On this page, only genetic mosaicism is discussed.

This is a controlled and natural developmental phenomenon in mammalian females. Females have two X chromosomes (and males have only one). The two X chromosomes in a female are rarely identical. They have the same genes, but at some loci (positions) they may have different alleles (versions of the same gene).

In the early embryo, each cell independently and randomly inactivates one copy of the X chromosome. This inactivation lasts the lifetime of the cell, and all the descendants of the cell inactivate that same chromosome. X-inactivation is reversed in the female germline, so that all egg cells contain an active X chromosome.

This phenomenon shows in the colouration of calico cats and tortoiseshell cats. These females are heterozygous for the X-linked colour genes: the genes for their coat colours are carried on the X chromosome. X-inactivation causes groups of cells to carry either one or the other X-chromosome in an active state.

X-inactivation is an epigenetic change, a switching off of genes on one chromosome. It is "not" a change in the genotype. Descendent cells of the embryo carry the same X-inactivation as the original cells. This may give rise to mild symptoms in female 'carriers' of X-linked genetic disorders.

Mutations in body cells (somatic mutations) cause groups of cells to differ in their genetics. 
Somatic mutation leading to mosaicism is common in the beginning and end stages of human life. Cancer research has shown that somatic mutations are responsible for most leukemia, lymphomas, and solid tumors.


Anti-fan

Anti-fans are the group of people who are opposed to particular person, system, or idea. This word is from a prefix 'anti-', which means 'opposed'. Anti-fans gather and criticize particular thing which they hate.

Anti-fans' activities are very diverse. Anti-fans usually work and share their views in online website. They make anti-fan page. E.g. anti-fan website, anti-fan blog, anti-fan internet cafe etc. And, they criticise their target, spread a rumor about the target, and post malicious comments to Internet articles. Anti-fans also work when they are offline. They sometimes boo and jeer at their target and even start a movement against the target. 

Early their activities used to be constructive criticism, but nowadays the movement of anti-fans is changing to severe insult to their target with no specific reason. The ruthless attack causes a lot of social problems now. A lot of celebrities who are the anti-fans' target are suffering from their behaviors. In some case, they may accuse anti-fans of personal insults. 

Anti-fans' targets are various. The most usual target is entertainer. There are a lot of anti-fans' website for the entertainer who they dislike. E.g. Some anti-fans oppose a form of music, movie, athlete, politician, political party, TV series, idea etc. Surprisingly, the number of anti-fans tends to be proportional to the target's popularity. Thus, the number sometimes becomes a yardstick of star's popularity.

Intelligent anti-fan is one type of anti-fans. Intelligent anti-fans act as if they are the target's real fan and do wrong and bad behaviors as the fan. They intelligently create the target's bad image and gather more anti-fan. 


Mountain pygmy possum

The mountain pygmy possum ("Burramys parvus") is a small, mouse-sized (weighs 45 g) nocturnal marsupial of Australia. It is found high up (1300 to 2230 metres) in rock screes and boulder fields of southern Victoria and in Kosciuszko National Park, New South Wales.

This possum is a Lazarus taxon, and the only living species in the Burramys genus. It is also the only Australian mammal restricted to an alpine habitat. Its prehensile tail, at ~14 cm, is longer than its 11 cm head and body length. Its diet consists of insects, fleshy fruits, nuts, nectar and seeds. 

The mountain pygmy possum was first described as a Pleistocene fossil by Robert Broom in 1896. It was thought to be extinct until 1966, when a living specimen was discovered in a ski-hut on Mount Hotham.

Three geographically isolated populations are known to exist. These populations have been shown to be genetically distinct. For most of the year, males and females live apart from each other. The females live on the better part of the rocky slopes, while the males live on the margins, usually lower on the mountain. In order to breed, the males migrate to the females' habitat. During the ski season on Mount Higginbotham, the males had to cross a road which put their survival in jeopardy. A "Tunnel of Love" was constructed under the road and a road sign was put in place to warn drivers.

Movie censorship

Censorship in movies is the act of giving a movie a very strong film rating systems classification, or banning the movie altogether.

The highest rating label in United Kingdom is 18. These means people under 18 cannot look at, buy or rent any movie under this rating. Movies with such a rating often have very strong language, explicit sexual content or heavy violence. If the content of the movie is higher than the 18 rating, the movie is then banned entirely.

Refused Classification is the very strongest rating in Australia. This rating means a movie has been banned from a part of Australia. In some cases, it has been banned in all of the country. This rating is tagged onto movies which the Australian Classification Board has said are too severe for viewing by general public.

The movie rating is NC-17 in the United States. This means No Children 17 and Under Admitted. Such movies contain strong sexual content, very strong violence or extremely graphic language and are usually considered too intense for an R rating.

The highest rating label in Canada is R. This means nobody under 18 may view, buy, rent, or watch any movie under this rating. Movie with this rating have strong sexual content/nudity, prolonged scenes of graphic violence, strong coarse language, graphic horror, and other disturbing content. If the content of the movie is higher than the R rating, the movie is then banned entirely.


Monsanto process

The Monsanto process is a way of making acetic acid. It uses a catalyst to add a carbonyl group to methanol. This process operates at a pressure of 30–60 atm and a temperature of 150–200 °C. It gives a selectivity greater than 99%. It was developed 1960 by German chemists working at BASF. Chemists at Monsanto introduced a new catalyst system in 1966. Today, chemists make acetic acid by the Cativa process, a similar iridium-based process developed by BP Chemicals Ltd which is more economical and environmentally friendly. So, the Monsanto process is not used very much in industry.

The process has several steps, which repeat to remake the catalyst:
The catalytically active species is the anion cis-[Rh(CO)I] (1). The catalytic cycle has been shown to involve six steps, two of which do not involve rhodium: conversion of methanol to methyl iodide and the hydrolysis of the acetyl iodide to acetic acid. (These steps are in the middle of the above diagram.) The first organometallic step is the oxidative addition of methyl iodide to "cis"-[Rh(CO)I] to form the hexacoordinate species [(CH)Rh(CO)I] (2). This anion rapidly transforms, by the migration of a methyl group to the carbonyl ligand, affording the pentacoordinate acetyl complex [(CHCO)Rh(CO)I] (3). This five-coordinate complex then reacts with carbon monoxide to form the six coordinate dicarbonyl complex. (4) This decomposes by reductive elimination to form acetyl iodide (CHCOI) and regenerate the active form of the catalyst. Acetyl iodide is then hydrolyzed to acetic acid.

The reaction mechanism is first-order with respect to methyl iodide and the catalyst (1). Hence the rate-determining step of the catalytic cycle has been proposed to be the oxidative addition of methyl iodide to the catalyst (1). Chemist think that this occurs with the rhodium center making a nucleophilic attack on the carbon of methyl iodide.

The Monsanto process for making acetic acid inspired chemists to invent a way to make Acetic anhydride. It is produced by carbonylation of methyl acetate.

In this process lithium iodide converts methyl acetate to lithium acetate and methyl iodide, which in turn affords through carbonylation acetyl iodide. Acetyl iodide reacts with acetate salts or acetic acid to give the product. Rhodium iodides and lithium salts are employed as catalysts. Because acetic anhydride is not stable in water, the conversion is conducted under water-free (anhydrous) conditions in contrast to the Monsanto acetic acid synthesis.


Communist Party of Pakistan

The Communist Party of Pakistan () is a communist party in Pakistan.

The CPP was founded in Calcutta, Union of India on March 6, 1948. A decision was taken at the Second All India Conference of the Communist Party of India, which was held in Calcutta at that time, that a separate communist party ought to be created in the new State of Pakistan. It was thought that Pakistan, being a relatively small country (in comparison to India) and suffering from instability, was ripe for revolution. The delegates from Pakistan separated themselves and held a separate session were they constituted the CPP.

Jōō (Edo period)

, alternatively romanized as Jō-ō or Shōō, was a after "Keian" and before "Meireki". This period started in September 1652 and ended in April 1655. During this time, the emperors were and .




Meireki




In 1656-1659, Go-Mizunoo built the Imperial villa and Japanese gardens at "Shugakuin Rikyū".



Manji

Manji or mangi may mean:



Regionalliga Ost

The Regionalliga Ost is one of three third level leagues in Austrian football.The Regionalliga is the highest league in Austrian amateur football. The league was reintroduced in the 1984-85 season. It covers the Austrian states of Burgenland, Lower Austria and Vienna. The champion of the league plays relegation versus the 9th of the Austrian football first league. The champion of the 2010/11 season was ESV Parndorf. The club failed in the relegation matches versus First Vienna FC.


Chimera

Chimaera or chimera can mean:



Heterochromia

Heterochromia means "different colors", and is most used for the description of different colored eyes. Some people, and animals, have differences between the irises of their eyes. There are many different causes for this condition.

Genetic causes for heterochromia include genetic mosaicism, where changes may take place in the dividing cells leading up to iris formation in the embryo. Or, environmental damage may occur to the eyes. Or, various diseases and medical conditions may result in changes in eye color.

Similar events may happen in other tissues, and sometimes result in visible tissue differences. However, the condition is most easily seen in the iris of the eye. The terms "Hetrochromia iridis" (= different color of the iris), "Heterochromia iridum" (plural form) and "Heterochromia iridium" (a mistake in Latin grammar) are variously used when it is the eye color which is specifically mentioned.

Osteopathy

Osteopathy is a philosophy that refers to the ability of the human body to heal itself.

Endogamy

Endogamy is the idea that a person ought to marry another person from the same group as them. The type of group is not always the same; it could be based on a religion, a class or a social group. Often group endogamy is enforced by arranged marriages, this is a system based on benefits for the group rather than marriage for love.

By marrying a person with the same group characteristics, it means that the partners will have similar views or beliefs about something. Many people marry endogamously for reasons of compatibility, which can be due to choice. But there are also other reasons when there is less choice involved or there is disapproval if it is not followed.

By doing this it keeps the numbers of a group to a minimum and thus creates stronger group bonds. For example, when moving to another country, a Sikh family may actively look for other Sikh families to mix with in order to facilitate Sikh marriages. By merging, they create a stronger bond between their own communities and can be a way to deal with being a minority.

If a group has been marrying endogamously for a long period of time the gene pool may be smaller and there is a greater chance of genetic disease. For example, within the Jewish community Tay-Sachs disease is a common genetic disease.



Exogamy

Exogamy is when a person ought to marry someone from outside a certain group.

In most places, exogamy is practiced in order to avoid incest, which is taboo in many groups across the world. This is to avoid some of the effects that endogamy creates such as genetic diseases. If two parents have very different genes then there is a lesser chance of a child inheriting both copies of that gene.

Exogamy is used to make a connection between two groups. For example, when a person marries another they become part of the family. This connection may be for reasons of inter-group cohesion. In other words, creating an alliance with another group.

Claude Levi-Strauss, an anthropologist, argued that when two families are connected by the marriage of two people it creates more relationships for trading other things such as food. It also means that they have more people to rely on. In order to keep this going, groups will trade sisters/daughters for wives and trade back in return.



Throw out the baby with the bath water

Throw out the baby with the bath water is an idiom.

The phrase describes a special kind of mistake which happens when something good is lost while trying to get rid of something bad.

The idiom summarizes what happens when something which is necessary is rejected along with what is not necessary.

A slightly different explanation focuses on the loss of the essential while holding on to what is not essential. In other words, the idiom also makes sense when someone might throw out the baby and keep the bath water. Idioms are a common stumbling block for learners of a language.

This idiom comes from a German proverb, "das Kind mit dem Bade ausschütten." In 1512, "Narrenbeschwörung" ("Appeal to Fools") by Thomas Murner includes a woodcut picture showing a woman tossing a baby out with waste water.

The meaning and intent are sometimes mirrored in different terms.

New Zealand at the Olympics

New Zealand at the Olympics is a history which began in 1908.

The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for New Zealand is NZL.

A team from New Zealand was first at the Olympic Games in 1908. They have been in every Summer Olympic Games since then. For their first two Games in 1908 and 1912, New Zealand was with Australia in a combined "Australasia" team. New Zealand first sent an independent team in 1920.

New Zealand has been in most Winter Olympic Games since 1952, missing only the 1956 and 1964 Games.

New Zealand athletes have won a total of 103 medals at the Summer Games. The most successful sport is athletics. New Zealand has only won a single medal at the Winter Games. The silver medal won by Annelise Coberger in alpine skiing at the 1992 Winter Olympics was the first medal won at the Winter Games by a Southern Hemisphere nation.

The New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC) is the National Olympic Committee for New Zealand. The NZOC was formed in 1911, and recognized by the IOC in 1919.

Being in the remote South Pacific, New Zealanders had to take long sea voyages to attend the early Olympics. It wasn’t until 1920 that New Zealand sent its first team. Before that three New Zealanders won medals for Australasian teams in 1908 and 1912.

As of 1111 athletes have represented New Zealand at the Olympic Games.

The total (NZ) does not include the medals won by New Zealanders as part of the combined Australasia team (ANZ) at the 1908 Summer Olympics and 1912 Summer Olympics:



Austria at the Olympics

Austria has been at most of the Olympic Games.

Azerbaijani athletes have won a total of twenty-six medals at the Summer Olympic Games. The nation has not won any medals at the Winter Olympic Games.

The National Olympic Committee of the Azerbaijani Republic was formed in 1992 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1993.



Belarus at the Olympics

Belarus was first in the Olympic at the 1952 Summer Games in Helsinki, Finland as part of the Soviet Union. After the Soviet Union disbanded in 1991, Belarus, along with four of the other fourteen former Soviet republics, were in the 1992 Winter Olympics (held in Albertville, France) as the Unified Team. Later in 1992, eleven republics joined Belarus to compete as the Unified Team at the Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain. Two years later, Belarus competed for the first time as an independent nation in the 1994 Winter Olympics, held in Lillehammer, Norway. From 1952 until the 2006 Olympic Games in Turin, Italy, 168 Belarusian athletes won 200 medals either as part of the Soviet Union or as independent Belarus.



Bearing (navigation)

In navigation, the word bearing is used for different methods that try to find out the angle between an object used for this purpose, and a reference direction. There are different systems of reference that can be used for this. A system of reference that is commonly used is that of Cardinal directions, as they can be found with a compass. The direction a ship is pointed can also be the reference.

Points that can easily be determined, and that move very little, can be taken as reference. Such points include stars, mountains, the sun, and beacons. Beacons come in the form of lighthouses on the coast, but also as electric beacons or other sea marks on the open sea. 

Bearings can be measured different ways. Optical bearings rely on visual information, other systems rely on radar for tools.

Roderick MacKinnon

Roderick MacKinnon (born 19 February 1956) is a professor of Molecular Neurobiology and Biophysics at Rockefeller University. He won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry together with Peter Agre in 2003 for his work on the structure and operation of ion channels.

MacKinnon was born in Burlington, Massachusetts and initially attended the University of Massachusetts Boston. MacKinnon then transferred to Brandeis University after one year, and there he received a bachelor's degree in biochemistry in 1978, studying calcium transport through the cell membrane for his honors thesis in Christopher Miller's laboratory. It was also at Brandeis where MacKinnon met his future wife and working-colleague Alice Lee.

After receiving his degree from Brandeis, MacKinnon entered medical school at Tufts University. He got his M.D. in 1982 and received training in Internal Medicine at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. He did not feel satisfied enough with the medical profession, so in 1986 he returned to Christopher Miller's laboratory at Brandeis for postdoctoral studies.

In 1989 he was appointed assistant professor at Harvard University where he studied the interaction of the potassium channel with a specific toxin taken from scorpion venom. He learned how to purify proteins and to use X-ray crystallography. In 1996, he moved to Rockefeller University as a professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology and Biophysics. There, he started to work on the structure of the potassium channel. These channels are of particular importance to the nervous system and the heart. The channels enable potassium ions to cross the cell membrane.

Potassium channels demonstrate a strange activity. They permit the passage of potassium ions, but they do not allow the passage of the much smaller sodium ions. Before MacKinnon's work, the detailed molecular architecture of potassium channels and the exact means by which they conduct ions was unknown. In 1998, despite barriers to the structural study of integral membrane proteins that had stopped most attempts for decades, MacKinnon and colleagues determined the three-dimensional molecular structure of a potassium channel from bacteria with X-ray crystallography. With this structure and other biochemical experiments, MacKinnon and colleagues were able to explain the exact mechanism by which potassium channel selectivity occurs.

His prize-winning research was conducted primarily at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source of Cornell University, and at the National Synchrotron Light Source of Brookhaven National Laboratory.

Luis Raymond Villafuerte is a politician from the Philippines. He is the son of former governor Luis Villafuerte Sr.

High arch

High arch is a human foot type, where the foot arch is higher than normal. People with high arches often feel foot pain, and have to wear special shoes.

Gamophobia

Gamophobia (prounced 'ga-me-PHO-bia', from the Greek 'gamo' meaning 'marriage') is the fear of getting married, being in a relationship, or commitment. The opposite of 'gamophobia' is 'anuptaphobia'-it is the fear of not being in a relationship (to be single or alone). A person who has gamophobia may like or love a person, but when he or she finds out about that person liking them back and attempting to be together, there is a possibility that their would change to hate.

Rather than a phobia, such behavior is linked to a number of personality disorders and neuroses. The majority of phobias are socially created, and are not found in any DSM Psychology manual. The inability to allow oneself to be vulnerable and show their 'bad parts' has a personality disorder. When the individual displays reaction formation (love to hate) this is a neurotic defense mechanism. This can also be known as commitment phobia.

Cluny Abbey

Cluny Abbey is a Benedictine abbey in Cluny. It was built in Romanesque style and its three churches date rom the 10th to the 12th century. It was founded by William I of Aquitaine in the year 910. Soon the place was noted because it followed the Rule of St. Benedict more strictly than the place where the rule was developed, that is Subiaco in Italy. Cluny became the leader of a movement called monasticism. The abbey also started the Cluniac Reforms, and was subject only to the pope, Sergius III at the time. The Benedictine order was very important for the stability of European society at the time. In 1790, during the French Revolution, the abbey was sacked, and mostly destroyed. Today, only very little of the original remains. 

Dating around 1334, the abbots of Cluny had a townhouse in Paris known as the Hôtel de Cluny, what is now a public museum since 1833. Apart from the name, it no longer possesses anything originally connected with Cluny.

Irish rebellion of 1798

The Irish rebellion of 1798 was an uprising of Irish people against British rule in Ireland. It was led by Wolfe Tone and consisted primarily of a secret society called the United Irish. It was aided by Republican France. However, it never gained much traction due to its alliance with anti-Catholic France, because Ireland was primarily Catholic. Despite the British government's anti-Catholicism, most Irish Catholics supported the Crown as the lesser of two evils because of the issue of Revolutionary France's involvement. The uprising lasted several months. A group called the United Irishmen were the main driving force in the rebellion. They were influenced by revolutions taking place in America and France around the time. The uprising is also known as United Irishmen Rebellion.

Between 10.000 and 50.000 people died as casualties on the Irish side, between 500 and 2000 on the English side.

Volcanic winter

A volcanic winter is a climate cooling caused by an extremely large volcanic eruption. Such an eruption releases ash and sulfur dioxide in huge quantities. They form aerosols of sulfuric acid. When they reach the stratosphere more sunlight is reflected, and some is absorbed by the stratosphere. These reactions heat up the stratosphere, but lead to a drop in the temperature on the ground.

The Siberian Traps, Emeishan Traps, and Deccan Traps are huge flood basalt provinces caused by volcanism. They are the cause, or part of the cause, of several mass extinctions, especially the Permian–Triassic extinction event.

Nuclear winter is a theory of similar effects which might be caused by a large-scale nuclear war.

The effects of recent volcanic eruptions on winters are modest in scale but historically their effects have been significant.
Most recently, the 1991 explosion of Mount Pinatubo, a stratovolcano in the Philippines, cooled global temperatures for about 2–3 years.

In 1883, the explosion of Krakatoa (Krakatau) created volcanic winter-like conditions. The next four years after the explosion were unusually cold, and the winter of 1887 to 1888 included powerful blizzards. Record snowfalls were recorded worldwide.

The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora, a stratovolcano in Indonesia, occasioned mid-summer frosts in New York State and June snowfalls in New England and Newfoundland and Labrador in what came to be known as the "Year without a Summer" of 1816.

A paper written by Benjamin Franklin in the 1780s blamed the unusually cool summer of 1783 on volcanic dust coming from Iceland. The eruption of Laki volcano had released enormous amounts of sulfur dioxide, resulting in the death of much of the island's livestock and a catastrophic famine which killed a quarter of the population. Temperatures in the northern hemisphere dropped by about 1 °C in the year following the Laki eruption.

In 1600, the Huaynaputina in Peru erupted. Tree ring studies show that 1601 was cold. Russia had its worst famine in 1601 to 1603. From 1600 to 1602, Switzerland, Latvia and Estonia had exceptionally cold winters. The wine harvest was late in 1601 in France, and in Peru and Germany wine production collapsed. Peach trees bloomed late in China, and Lake Suwa in Japan froze early.

In 1452 or 1453, a cataclysmic eruption of the submarine volcano named Kuwae. It caused worldwide disruptions.

The Great Famine of 1315–1317 in Europe may have been caused by a volcanic event. That of Kaharoa, New Zealand, had lasted about five years.


4Minute

4Minute () was a five-member South Korean K-pop girl group. Its members are Nam Ji-hyun, Heo Ga-yoon, Jeon Ji-yoon, Kim Hyun-ah and Kwon So-hyun. They belonged to Cube Entertainment. Far Eastern Tribe Records in Universal Music Japan is responsible for 4minute's labels in Japan. Their official fan club name is 4Nia. This is a combination of "4Minute" and "mania".

They debuted through the M.net M! Countdown on June 18, 2009, with their song "Hot Issue". The name "4minute" has two meanings. One means that each of its member will attract audiences in 4 minutes and this is why all of their songs are shorter than 4 minutes. The other meaning is that they will do their best for a minute (for every moment).

Kim Hyun-ah already released two singles. She used to be a member of Wonder Girls and Kwon So-hyun was a member of girl group "Orange". Nam Ji-hyun is best in dance, Heo Ga-yoon in drama, Jeon Ji-yoon in music and Kim Hyun-ah is best in the Department of Theater and Film. 
In December 2010, it released its first Japanese album, Diamond. In 2011, the group released its first Korean full-length album, 4Minutes Left with the title track "Mirror Mirror" and the following years they have promoted 2 more mini albums and 2 chart topping hits "Volume Up" and "What's Your Name"
The group received the Bonsang Award at the 20th Seoul Music Awards, and the Kpop New Artist Award at the 2010 Billboard Japan Music Awards.

The Group disbanded in 2016 after 4 of the 5 members left Cube Entertainment.

Double acute accent

The double acute accent ( ˝ ) is a special mark called a diacritic. It is usually used to make a vowel sound longer. It is only used in the Latin alphabet. The double acute accent is mainly used in Hungarian. Because of this, it is sometimes called the hungarumlaut. This is a way of writing "Hungarian umlaut".


Ken Park

Ken Park is a 2002 American movie. It is a co-direction by Larry Clark and Edward Lachman. It was written by Harmony Korine, based off Clark's journals. The movie was highly controversial because of its subject matter. The movie was not rated by the MPAA but is similar to an NC-17 due to foul language and strong sexual material involving minors. In Australia, "Ken Park" was rated Refused Classification due to content.

Cosmic distance ladder

The cosmic distance ladder (also known as the extragalactic distance scale) is the way astronomers measure the distance of objects in space. No one method works for all objects and distances, so astronomers use a number of methods.

A real "direct" distance measurement of an astronomical object is possible only for those objects that are close enough to Earth (within about a thousand parsecs). It is the larger distances which are the problem. Several methods rely on a standard candle, which is an astronomical object that has a known standard luminosity.

The ladder analogy arises because no one technique can measure distances at all ranges encountered in astronomy. Instead, one method can be used to measure nearby distances, a second can be used to measure nearby to intermediate distances, and so on. Each rung of the ladder provides information that can be used to determine the distances at the next higher rung.

The astronomical unit is the mean (average) distance of the Earth from the Sun. This we know quite accurately. Kepler's Laws tell the ratios of the distances of planets, and radar tells the absolute distance to inner planets and artificial satellites in orbit around them.

Parallax is the use of trigonometry to discover the distances of objects near to the solar system.

As the Earth orbits around the Sun, the position of nearby stars will appear to shift slightly against the more distant background. These shifts are angles in a right triangle, with 2 AU making the short leg of the triangle and the distance to the star being the long leg. The amount of shift is quite small, measuring 1 arcsecond for an object at a distance of 1 parsec (3.26 light-years)

This method works for distances up to a few hundred parsecs.

Objects of known brightness are called "standard candles". Most physical distance indicators are standard candles. These are objects which belong to a class that has a known brightness. By comparing the known luminosity of the latter to its observed brightness, the distance to the object can be computed using the inverse-square law. 

In astronomy, the brightness of an object is given in terms of its absolute magnitude. This quantity is derived from the logarithm of its luminosity as seen from a distance of 10 parsecs. The apparent magnitude is the magnitude as seen by the observer. It can be used to determine the distance "D" to the object in kiloparsecs (kiloparsec = 1,000 parsecs) as follows:

where "m" the apparent magnitude and "M" the absolute magnitude. For this to be accurate, both magnitudes must be in the same frequency band and there can be no relative motion in the radial direction.

Some means of accounting for interstellar extinction, which also makes objects appear fainter and more red, is also needed. The difference between absolute and apparent magnitudes is called the distance modulus, and astronomical distances, especially intergalactic ones, are sometimes tabulated in this way.

Two problems exist for any class of standard candle. The principal one is calibration, finding out exactly what the absolute magnitude of the candle is. 

The second lies in recognizing members of the class. The standard candle calibration does not work unless the object belongs to the class. At extreme distances, which is where one most wishes to use a distance indicator, this recognition problem can be quite serious.

A significant issue with standard candles is the question of how standard they are. For example, all observations seem to indicate that Type Ia supernovae that are of known distance have the same brightness, but it's possible that "distant" Type Ia supernovae have different properties than "nearby" Type Ia supernovae.

With few exceptions, distances based on direct measurements are available only up to about a thousand parsecs, which is a modest portion of our own galaxy. For distances beyond that, measures depend upon physical assumptions, that is, the assertion that one recognizes the object in question, and the class of objects is homogeneous enough that its members can be used for meaningful estimation of distance.

Physical distance indicators, used on progressively larger distance scales, include:


In a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram the absolute magnitude for a group of stars is plotted against the spectral classification of the stars. Evolutionary patterns are found that relate to the mass, age and composition of the star. In particular, during their hydrogen burning period, stars lie along a curve in the diagram called the main sequence. 

By measuring the properties from a star's spectrum, the position of a main sequence star on the H-R diagram can be found. From this the star's absolute magnitude is estimated. A comparison of this value with the apparent magnitude allows the approximate distance to be determined, after correcting for interstellar extinction of the luminosity because of gas and dust.

In a gravitationally-bound star cluster such as the Hyades, the stars formed at approximately the same age and lie at the same distance. This allows relatively accurate main sequence fitting, providing both age and distance determination.

This is not a complete list of methods, but it does show the ways astronomers go about estimating the distance of astronomical objects.

V-1 flying bomb

The V-1 flying bomb (also called the Buzz Bomb or Doodlebug) was a World War II weapon. 

It was a flying bomb, an early cruise missile. Its jet engine made it travel at 350 mph (600 kmph). The Luftwaffe aimed it at London, and also Antwerp in Belgium. V-1s destroyed nearly as many houses as the Blitz did but killed fewer: 22,892 people were killed by the weapon. 

The Allies tried to stop these attacks by bombing their launching places, by shooting at them in the air, and by flying fast planes close to them and nudging them off course using their wings.

They had a fairly crude guidance system. Overall, only about 25 per cent of V-1s hit their targets. Most were lost lost by defensive measures, mechanical unreliability or guidance errors.


Citrus Blast

Citrus Blast is a grapefruit flavored soft drink. It is made by PepsiCo. It has no caffeine. It was first sold in 2011.

Young Dracula

Young Dracula is a British children's fantasy television series. It is shown on CBBC. The series is based on "Young Dracula AND Young Monsters", a children's book by Michael Lawrence. The series is directed by Joss Agnew. It was first broadcast in 2006.

"Young Dracula" was nominated for Best Children's Drama in the 2008 BAFTA Awards. A fourth series is now being filmed.

Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search

The Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search, or SWEEPS, was an astronomical survey. It was carried out in 2006. SWEEPS used the Hubble Space Telescope to look at 180,000 stars for seven days to find extrasolar planets.

The stars that SWEEPS monitored were all in the Sagittarius-I Window. This is a rare transparent look at the huge group of closely packed stars at the Milky Way's centre (central bulge), in the Sagittarius constellation. Our view to most of the stars in the centre of the galaxy is blocked by lanes of dust. These stars are about 27,000 light years from Earth.
Sixteen planets were discovered by SWEEPS. They took from 0.6 to 4.2 days to go around the Sun. Planets which took less than 1.2 days to go around the sun have not been detected yet; these have been called "ultra-short period planets" (USPPs) by the search team. USPPs were discovered only around stars with a low mass. This means that larger stars might have destroyed any planets orbiting so closely, or that planets could not move as far inward around larger stars.

SWEEPS-4 and SWEEPS-11 orbited stars that were very different to other stars close by. This made it possible for these to be looked at again using the radial velocity method. Their masses could then be found.



Tenna

The "nengō" "Tenna" means "Peace of Heaven".






In Tenna, the first book was written about the coins of Japan. The work was entitled "Classified Collection of Coins" ("Kwacho Kuien").



Brown asbestos

Brown asbestos, also called grunerite or amosite, is one of the six types of asbestos. It has the chemical formula FeSiO(OH). It is less common than white asbestos but can be found in some construction materials. Like other types of asbestos, being exposed to it can cause mesothelioma and asbestosis.

Jōkyō

The new era of was created by the Imperial court. After 1684, the power to create a calendar shifted to the shogunate. The Tokugawa astrology bureau developed a calendar which was independent of Chinese almanacs.







Data Encryption Standard

The Data Encryption Standard is a 56-bit cipher that was once recommended by the U.S. Government. In 1998, it was defeated by a machine built by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. It has been replaced by the Advanced Encryption Standard in most uses.

After DES was cracked, the NIST, the US institution for technology and also cryptography, developed "3DES". It has 3 times more bits, but is otherwise the same as DES.

Theoretically, 3DES should provide 168 bits of security. But because of the design, the NIST later said it only provides 80 bits of security. That can be broken by a modern computer and thus the cipher should be considered broken.

Sha Tin Racecourse

The Sha Tin Racecourse is a horse racing venue in Hong Kong.

1925 Geneva Protocol

The Geneva Protocol of 1925 (The Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare) was a law that made it illegal to fight with chemical or biological weapons in interstate war. The Geneva protocol was signed on June 17, 1925 and the protocol was entered into force on January 8, 1928. Before, it was signed by some countries like the United Kingdom and France originally. Any country who has signed this Protocol must follow it.

After World War I, the Geneva Protocol was made from the treaties signed with Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria. The use of chemical weapons began in WWI when one million deaths resulted from chemical weapons.

After signing the treaty, some countries wanted to change it so that they would not have to follow it if the country fighting them did not follow the treaty. Because of this, many countries like France and United Kingdom withdrew from it. Others, like the United States still follow it but with this extra condition.


Fledge

Fledge is the stage in a young bird's life when the feathers and wing muscles become developed enough for flight. It also describes the act of a chick's parents raising it until it is fully grown. A young bird that has recently fledged but still needs care and feeding is called a fledgling.

In ornithology, fledging has many meanings, depending on species. Birds are sometimes considered fledged once they leave the nest, even if they still cannot fly.

Rat snake

Rat snakes are medium to large snakes that can be found mostly in the northern hemisphere. They feed primarily on rodents and birds and, with some species being over 3 m (10 feet), they are on the top levels of some food chains. Many species make attractive pets and one, the corn snake, is one of the most popular reptile pets in the world. Other species can be very sensitive and sometimes aggressive, but the bites are not dangerous. Rat snakes were long thought to be completely nonvenomous, but recent studies have shown that some do have harmlessly small amounts of venom in them. When frightened, rat snakes may freeze, which is why a lot has been killed in traffic.

Rat snakes are commonly kept as pets. The corn snake especially is one of the most popular pet reptiles, and belongs to the rat snake family.


Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a type of mass spectrometry that is highly sensitive. It can see a range of metals and several non-metals at concentrations below one part in 10 (part per trillion). It is based on hooking together an inductively coupled plasma as a method of producing ions (ionization) with a mass spectrometer as a method of separating and detecting the ions. Many chemists use Argon as a carrier gas to make the plasma. The machine sends the sample ions through a series of small cones. The cones let the plasma ions slowly enter the vacuum chamber of the mass spectrometer.

In trace elemental analysis, the method has advantages of high speed, precision and sensitivity compared to atomic absorption techniques. Analysis of lower concentrations at the same time is more prone to disruption by trace contaminants in labware and reagents used. Some analytes can not work with ICP-MS. Verification of analysis results requires additional work.

The variety of applications is wider than ICP-OES and includes isotopic speciation. Because ICP-MS can help make atom bombs, ICP-MS hardware is a subject for special exporting regulations.

The Birds of America

The Birds of America is a book by naturalist and painter John James Audubon. It includes illustrations of a wide variety of birds of the United States. It was first published between 1827 and 1838, in Edinburgh and London.

The work is of hand-coloured, life-size prints, made from engraved plates, measuring around . It includes images of six birds that are now extinct: Carolina Parakeet, Passenger Pigeon, Labrador Duck, Great Auk,
Esquimaux Curlew, and Pinnated Grouse.

Charles Wright (poet)

Charles Wright (born August 25, 1935) is an American poet. He was awarded the National Book Award (1983) for "Country Music: Selected Early Poems" and the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (1998) for "Black Zodiac".


4-H

4-H in the United States is a youth organization administered by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), with the mission of "engaging youth to reach their fullest potential while advancing the field of youth development." The name represents four personal development areas for the organization's members: head, heart, hands, and health. The organization has over 6.5 million members in the United States. Members are five to 19 years old, in approximately 90,000 clubs.

The goal of 4-H is to develop citizenship, leadership, responsibility and life skills of youth through experiential learning programs and a positive youth development approach. Many people think of 4-H as an agriculturally-focused organization as a result of its history. But 4-H today focuses on citizenship, healthy living, science, engineering, and technology programs.

Today, 4-H and related programs exist in over eighty countries around the world. The organization and administration varies from country to country. Each of these programs operates independently. They cooperate in international exchanges, global education programs, and communications.

The 4-H motto is "To make the best better", while its slogan is "Learn by doing" (sometimes written as "Learn to do by doing").

The start of 4-H began around 1900, with the work of several people in different parts of the United States. The focal point of 4-H has been the idea of practical and hands-on learning, which came from the desire to make public school education more connected to rural life. Early programs tied both public and private resources together to benefit rural youth.

During this time, researchers at agricultural experiment stations of the land-grant universities and USDA saw that adult farmers did not readily accept new agricultural discoveries, but educators found that youth would experiment with these new ideas and then share their experiences and successes with the adults. So, rural youth programs became a way to introduce new agriculture technology to the adults.
A. B. Graham started one of the youth programs in Clark County, Ohio, in 1902, which is considered the birth of the 4-H program in the United States. The first club was called "The Tomato Club" or the "Corn Growing Club". T.A. "Dad" Erickson of Douglas County, Minnesota, started local agricultural after-school clubs and fairs also in 1902. Jessie Field Shambaugh developed the clover pin with an H on each leaf in 1910, and, by 1912, they were called 4-H clubs. The national 4-H organization was formed in 1914. When the United States Congress created the Cooperative Extension Service (CES) of the USDA by passage of the Smith-Lever Act of 1914, it included within the CES charter the work of various boys' and girls' clubs involved with agriculture, home economics and related subjects. By 1924, these clubs became organized as 4-H clubs, and the clover emblem was adopted.

The first 4-H camp was held in Randolph County, West Virginia. Originally, these camps were for what was referred to as "Corn Clubs". Campers slept in corn fields, in tents, only to wake up and work almost the entirety of each day. Superintendent of schools G. C. Adams began a boys' corn club in Newton County, Georgia, in 1904. However, the city of Jacksboro, Texas, also stakes a claim to having the first forerunner to 4-H in 1910.

4-H membership hit an all-time high in 1974 as a result of its popular educational program about nutrition, "Mulligan Stew", shown in schools and on television across the country.


Emeishan Traps

The Emeishan Traps is a flood basalt volcanic province in Southwestern China, around Sichuan province. Many igneous rock types can be found there. This is known as large igneous province in geology. Other names for the traps include Permian Emeishan Large Igneous Province, and other variations. The Traps are the step-like rock made up of many layers of basalt, which were laid down by successive eruptions of magma. 

The eruptions that lead to the Emeshian traps began about 260 million years ago. The traps are much smaller than the Siberian Traps, which occurred not long afterwards, about 251 million years ago. Despite this, the Emeshian traps were large enough to have an impact on the ecology of the time, and on paleontology. They are part of the mass extinction events towards the end of the Permian period.

The Emeishan Traps are part of the scientific debate on the causes of mass extictions. The end-Guadalupian extinction occurred at almost the same time as the Emeshian Traps were formed. This supports the argument, that volcanism is the main driving force behind mass extinctions. Another theory that has been proposed to explain mass extinctions is that meteor or comet impact events caused them. In this context, the hypothesis is that impact events cause flood basalt eruptions, such as those which generated the Emeshian Traps. This hypothesis is not widely supported.


Hurricane Janet

Hurricane Janet was a deadly hurricane in September 1955. She killed 687 people in the Caribbean and in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. Janet peaked at Category Five strength: her winds reached the 175 mile per hour level. The name Janet was later retired.

RMS Carpathia

RMS "Carpathia" was a passenger steamship of the Cunard Line.

"Carpathia" was built by Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson. The ship made her maiden voyage in 1903.

She was famous for rescuing the survivors of RMS "Titanic" after the RMS "Titanic" hit an iceberg and sank on 15 April 1912.

"Carpathia" was sunk in the Atlantic on 17 July 1918 during the First World War. She sank after being torpedoed by an Imperial German Navy U-boat. The captain of the Carpathia was A.H. Rostron.


Carpathia

Carpathia has several meanings:


Pope Clement V

Pope Clement V (; 1264 –20 April, 1314), born Bertrand de Got, was a French cleric of the Roman Catholic Church and the 196th Pope from 1305 until his death.

He was the first of the seven popes who lived in Avignon in France.

Bertrand de Got was born around 1264 in Villandraut in Gironde region of France.

Betrand was Archbishop of Bordeaux.

He was elected pope on June 5, 1305; and he chose to be called Clement V. He was the fourth of six non-cardinals to be elected pope in the Middle Ages.

Pope Clement moved the papacy to Avignon.

The pope was involved in conflicts with the Knights Templar.



Mucous membrane

A mucous membrane (or mucosae; singular mucosa) is a skin-like lining. A mucus membrane is covered in epithelium. They secrete mucus, and in the alimentary canal they absorb nutrients. They line cavities that are exposed to the external environment and internal organs. 

At several places they connect up (are contiguous) with the skin. For example, at the nostrils, the mouth, the lips, the eyelids, the ears, the genital area, and the anus. Unlike skin, which has hair growing out of it, mucous membranes are hairless.

The sticky, thick fluid secreted by the mucous membranes and glands is called "mucous". The term "mucous membrane" refers to where they are found in the body. However, not every mucous membrane secretes mucous.

Thimble

A thimble is a small, hard cup. People wear one on their finger for protection from the needle when sewing.

Raymond Poincaré

Raymond Poincaré (20 August 1860 - 15 October 1934) was a French politician of the Third Republic. He was a cousin of the mathematician Henri Poincaré. He was president of France from 1913 to 1920, and Foreign minister several times. He had studied law at the Sorbonne and was trained to be a lawyer. He held a neutral view in the Dreyfus Affair at first, but later supported Dreyfus.

Knob and tube wiring

Knob and tube wiring (abbreviated K&T) was an early type of electrical wiring. It was commonly used from the 1880s to the early 1940s, and is occasionally, but very rarely, still used today. In knob and tube wiring, wires were held to the wooden structure by ceramic "knobs", and were protected by ceramic "tubes" when they went through a piece of wood. Wires were held to the knobs by another piece of non-conducting wire. A material called loom protected the wire when it entered a junction box, which usually contained an outlet, switch, or light fixture. Splices were soldered together and wrapped in cloth electrical tape. The insulation on knob and tube wiring was usually cotton cloth soaked in asphalt. To prevent short circuits, the hot and neutral wires were kept far apart. This is not necessary on modern wiring because modern insulation alone is enough to prevent short circuits. Knob and tube wiring did not have a ground wire and therefore did not have three-prong outlets. Most electrical codes allow the use of a GFCI to update knob and tube outlets to three-prong without installing any new wire.

Knob and tube wiring used cloth insulation. Over time this insulation can wear out, become brittle, and fall off, leaving bare wire. The ceramic knobs and tubes provide some protection because even if the insulation does fall off, the bare wire can not touch the wooden structure. The insulation is also somewhat flammable. Some knob and tube insulation intended for industrial use contained asbestos, which reduced the risk of fire, but can cause cancer. Unlike modern wiring, splices were not contained in a protective box. If a splice failed, it could make a spark and start a fire. The fuse boxes usually had no protection from using an incorrect fuse. An incorrect fuse could cause the wiring to overheat and become damaged or start a fire. Another problem is that when a fuse blew, people who didn't know or didn't care about the hazards would sometimes replace it with a coin or a ball of foil if a replacement fuse wasn't available, leaving no overload protection at all. These issues can be partially corrected by installing a modern circuit breaker panel with arc fault circuit interrupter breakers. There was also no ground wire. Knob and tube can be updated with a GFCI to add the equivalent of grounding. There is generally no need to replace knob and tube wiring if it is in good condition.

Unlike modern wiring, knob and tube supply and return wires were not always alongside each other. In the oldest installations, several branch circuits could share the same neutral wire, which can cause overloads. To prevent overloads in this layout, the neutral wires were protected with fuses. If a neutral fuse blew or was removed, it could create a dangerous condition where the power appeared to be off, but was in fact still present. Three-way switches could also be wired in such a way that the outer ring of a lamp socket, which is normally connected to neutral, could be connected to hot, which is an electric shock hazard.


Post-postmodernism

Post-postmodernism is a general term used to describe new developments emerging from postmodernism. A similar term is metamodernism. These terms are not always accepted: for example, they are not in the Tate Guide to modern art terms.

Modernism began around 1900. It was a rejection of tradition and an attempt to see the world differently. Events such as World War 2 and the Great Depression made many feel modernism had failed. This led to postmodernism, which is cold and skeptical of the grand narrative of Western Society. This grand narrative is explained by Jean-François Lyotard as something. Postmodernism is a very broad term that cannot be defined by specific themes. It is an all-encompassing way of thinking.

Postmodernism is seen as a theory for explaining 20th Century culture. With the 20th Century now behind us and a new century beginning, many have suggested that Postmodernism is outdated in our current world. Advances such as the internet have changed the way we live, making the world a smaller place but also making communication and interaction with things around us less intimate. Post-Postmodernism takes this as a key reason why a return to sincerity and authentic expression is the way forward for the 21st Century.

Post-postmodernism is a very new idea that is still forming. There are many different ideas about how post-postmodernism could evolve and shape culture. They look to where faith, trust, dialogue, performance, and sincerity can work to overcome postmodern irony. 

Enzo Fortuny

Enzo Favio Fortuny (born June 7, 1981 in Veracruz, Mexico) is a Latin American voice actor. He is always credited as "Enzo Fortuny". While he remains as a specialist in young men's voices, his range is ample enough to allow him to portray either gentler roles (like Yukito Tsukishiro) or much rougher ones (like InuYasha). He is the Latin American Disney XD channel speaker and the official Latin American Dub-over artists of Drake Bell and Elijah Wood.


Exercise physiology

Exercise physiology is the study of the acute responses and chronic adaptations to a wide-range of physical exercise conditions. In addition, many exercise physiologists study the effect of exercise on pathology, and the mechanisms by which exercise can reduce or reverse disease progression. 
An exercise physiologist's area of study may include but is not limited to biochemistry, bioenergetics, cardiopulmonary function, hematology, biomechanics, skeletal muscle physiology, neuroendocrine function, and central and perpheral nervous system function. Also, exercise physiologists range from basic scientists, to clinical researchers, to clinicians, to sports trainers.

Short circuit

A short circuit is a problem in an electrical circuit where two or more wires that are not supposed to come in contact with each other touch. A short circuit can result in a very high current flowing through the circuit. The high current can destroy components, melt insulation and start a fire. If there is enough voltage, it can also cause an explosion called arc flash. Circuit breakers and fuses are devices that detect short circuits and (usually) shut the power off before any damage can be done.

A "short circuit" also happens when there is a bypass of electrical current. As electricity is "lazy", when there is a bypass without a "load" (e.g. Bulb), it will travel that route of least electrical impedance.

The term "short circuit" is frequently misused to describe any electrical problem.

Circuit breaker

A circuit breaker is a device designed to shut off an electrical circuit when too much current is flowing. This usually occurs if too many devices are plugged in or if there is a short circuit. Circuit breakers are usually installed in the electrical panel. Some circuit breakers also have GFCI protection. Inside the circuit breaker, there is usually an electromagnetic coil. When too much current flows through the coil, it pulls on the switch, shutting the power off. The coil reacts to immediate short circuits. There is also a bimetal strip that will bend and pull on the switch if it gets too hot. This reacts to extended periods of too much current. 

Some advanced circuit breakers monitor current electronically, and shut the power off when an electronic sensor detects too much current. A circuit breaker does the same job as a fuse, but unlike a fuse, a circuit breaker does not need to be replaced to be reset, except in some severe cases such as very high-current short circuits and lightning strikes that may damage the circuit breaker.




The Merchant of Venice

The Merchant of Venice is a play written by William Shakespeare. The date the play was written in unknown, but the play was mentioned in 1598 in Francis Mere's "Wit's Treasury". A date of 1596-1597 is now accepted. Shakespeare's source was "Il Pecorone" by Ser Giovanni, a 14th-century Florentine writer.

"The Merchant of Venice" was first published in 1600. It was again published in 1619, and then in 1623 in the First Folio, a collection of all of Shakespeare's plays. The play has been made into television programs many times and also into some movies. Three operas are based on the play.

Bassanio is an aristocratic but poor young man from Venice. He has fallen in love with Portia, a beautiful young lady of Belmont. Bassanio needs money to woo the lady. He asks his friend Antonio, the merchant of Venice, for a loan.

Antonio's money is tied up in business ventures. Antonio borrows money from a Jewish moneylender named Shylock. Antonio signs a bond agreeing to give Shylock a pound of his flesh if the money is not repaid on a certain date. Bassanio uses the money to travel to Belmont. He wins Portia's love.

Antonio cannot repay the borrowed money on time. Shylock insists on the pound of flesh as stated in the bond. The case goes to court. Portia disguises herself as a lawyer. She says that Shylock's bond is cruel. His insistence on the terms of the bond is just, but justice must be softened with mercy but Shylock does not relent. Portia then traps Shylock in the loopholes of his own bond and thus Shylock is not only forced to release Antonio but also give away his wealth and religion.

Yoji Koda

Koda was born in December 1949 at Tokushima Prefecture. He studied at the Defense Academy at Yokosuka in 1968-1972.

Koda served on several JMSDF ships, including the "Yudachi" (DD-108), the "Shirayuki" (DD-123), and the "Sawayuki" (DD-125).


Admiral Koda retired from JMSDF in August 2008.

The Regionalliga Mitteis one of three 3rd level leagues in Austrian football. It is formed by teams from Upper Austria, Styria, Carinthia and East Tyrol. It is the highest level of amateur football in Austria. The champion plays a relegation match versus the champion of the Regionalliga West. In the 2010/11 season the champion was the LASK Juniors team. In Austria second teams of professional clubs are not allowed to promot to professional football. In the relegation match versus WSG Wattens Blau Weiß Linz, the second of the season won and was promoted to Austrian Football First League .

Tawakel Karman

Tawakel Karman (born 7 February 1979) came to international attention as a leader in the 2011 Yemeni uprising, part of the Arab Spring. Yemenis have called her "Iron Woman" and "Mother of the Revolution." She won the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize with two other women. She is the first Yemeni and the first Arab woman to win the prize. She is the second Muslim woman to win any Nobel Prize and the youngest Nobel Peace Laureate.

Karman is a journalist. She is also politician and senior member of the of Al-Islah political party. She is also works to improve human rights. She is one of the people who started the group "Women Journalists Without Chains". She became well known in Yemen after 2005. As a journalist, she helped a mobile phone news service after the government did not give them a license. She led protests for press freedom and organized weekly protests for reform. She lead the Yemini protests to support the Arab Spring after the Tunisian people overthrew the government of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011. She has opposed President Ali Abdullah Saleh and thinks he should not be president any longer.

Karman earned a college degree in commerce from the University of Science and Technology, Sana'a. She also completed a graduate degree in political science from the University of Sana'a. She is married to Mohammed al-Nahmi

Porsche 911

The Porsche 911 is a luxury sports car made by Porsche since 1964, in Zuffenhausen, Stuttgart.

A Painful Case

"A Painful Case" is a short story, written by James Joyce, an Irish author. This short story is one of the series which was published in his 1914 series. 

A Painful Case tells of the loneliness and isolation of two characters, Mr. James Duffy and Mrs. Emily Sinico. He is a lonely person who meets a woman by accident. Every morning he goes to work from his isolated suburb of Dublin by tram. In the afternoons, he goes to Dan Burk’s and eats his lunch there; a bottle of larger beer and a few arrowroot biscuits. At four o’clock, he is free. He has done the same work for four years, so his daily routine never changes. His evenings are always spent playing his landlady's piano or roaming around the city. He doesn’t have friends or companions; he enjoys his own spirituality by himself. He visits his family and relatives only at Christmas or for a funeral, but only when someone in his family dies. His only hobby is to attend an opera or a concert since he is a fan of Mozart.

One evening, Mr. Duffy attends a concert in the Rotunda and notices a lady sitting next to him; Mrs. Sinico. When she comments about the small audience, he sees this as an invitation to talk to her. She is attractive and looks intelligent. In a few weeks, he meets her again at a concert in Earlsfort Terrace. This time, he has an opportunity to be close to her, while she is paying attention to her daughter. During their conversation, he figures out that she has a husband, but he doesn’t feel cautious of her. They then meet a third time by accident, and he asks her to meet him again. After that, they begin to see each other often, in her house. 

He lends his books and music to her and shares his intellectual life. They are becoming close and spend more time together at her house. They talk about personal matters. They stay together until dark. They seem to have many things in common. One night, in a moment of excitement, she presses his hand to her cheek. He is surprised by this because she has misunderstood that he has the same feelings for her. He is confused by how she interpreted his words. After this incident, he doesn’t visit her for a week and then sends mail asking to meet her. In the end, they agree they cannot meet again and so they stop talking.

After four years, Mr. Duffy has returned to his normal life. However, he avoids concerts because he is afraid of seeing her. One night he reads in a newspaper of her death; “Mrs. Emily Sinico, aged forty-three years, was killed at Sydney Parade Station yesterday evening." After reading the painful news, he is disgusted by it. To him, she seems crude for having gotten drunk and then dying in such a shameful manner. He goes out to the pub thinking of the memory of her hand touching him. While he is drinking, he struggles with two images of her; the lonely drunkard and the intelligent woman he was close to. He realizes that she is now just a memory. He wonders if he could have done something for her. He now realizes he loves her, but it is too late. Now, he thinks of their lonely lives. He knows that his life will continue in the same pattern until he dies. As he walks, even though it is extremely cold, he feels that she is there with him; it seems that he could even hear her voice, since his memory of her is so strong. He looks down at the wall of the park and he sees lovers lying there. He feels that he is an outcast from human life. The lovers are aware that he is there and they wish he would leave.

When Mrs. Sinico showed interest, Mr. Duffy ignored her emotions. Perhaps, his cold-headedness broke her heart. She thought she was close to him, so she opened up to him, while he only thought of her as a friend. She desired love and caring because she was lonely, even though she was married with a child. He didn’t realize until she was gone, that he would be alone until his death.

Anthropometry

Anthropometry is the study of measurement and proportions of the human body.

Anthropometry was first created by Alphonse Bertillon (April 24, 1853 – February 13, 1914). He was born in Paris, France. When he became a police officer, he created Anthropometry so that criminals could be easily identified. The system helped the police to get through many criminal records quicker. Having produced a set of characteristics of criminals, it became easier for the police to identify offenders.

The system involves 10 measurements:


Eyelid

An eyelid is a thin piece of skin that covers and protects the eye. It is one of the thinnest areas of skin on a persons body. A muscle pulls back the eyelid to "open" the eye. People do this willingly or without thinking. The human eyelid has a row of eyelashes that help protect the eye from dust and other small objects. Eyelashes also keep sweat out of the eye. Eyelids regularly spread tears and other secretions on the surface of the eye to keep it moist. The cornea is one part of the eye that must be kept moist. Eyelids keep the eyes from drying out when asleep. Also, the blink reflex protects the eye from things touching it.

Korean Americans

Korean Americans (Korean: ; Hanja: ; "Hangukgye Migukin") are Americans of Korean descent. They are mostly from South Korea. A small amount are from North Korea. The Korean American community comprises about 0.5% of the United States population or about 1.6 million people and is the fifth largest Asian American subgroup, after the Indian American, Chinese American, Vietnamese American and Filipino American communities. The U.S. has the second-largest Korean community in the world. The largest is in the People's Republic of China.

Gentlemen's agreement

A gentlemen's agreement is an agreement made between two or more people. It can be written down, spoken, or just understood. A gentlemen's agreement needs people to be honourable and stick to the agreement, instead of enforcing the agreement. Because of this, it is different from a legal agreement or contract, because a legal agreement or contract can be enforced if needed.

Hovenia dulcis

Hovenia dulcis is also called the oriental raisin tree. It is a plant that lives in Japan, Korea, Eastern China and the Himalayas.

The oriental raisin tree grows about 10 meters tall. Its bark of the tree is dark gray. Its flowers are white, and they open between June and July. The tree grows fruit in September and October. The fruits are brown, and they are shaped like a chicken's claw. Its seeds fall off from February to March. Its germination rate, which is the number of seeds that begin to spore or grow, is about 2 – 15%. Most trees begin to grow their own fruit when they are two years old.

The oriental raisin tree can grow with shade or light. Cold does not hurt the tree, but too much time without rain does hurt it. Unlike many other plants, the oriental raisin tree can grow even if the soil has lots of salt in it, so often lives near the sea. Pollution does not hurt the oriental raisin tree either, so it can live in cities and other industrial areas. 

The wood of the oriental raisin tree can be used to make buildings, musical instruments, ships, and furniture. Because the stem tastes sweet, people like to eat it and make drinks from it. This stem is also used for medicine.

Dalit

"Dalit" refers to socially, economically and historically marginalized communities predominantly in India . It also means "broken/scattered" in Sanskrit and Hindi . The term "dalits" was in use as a translation for the British Raj census classification of "Depressed Classes" prior to 1935. It was popularised by the economist and reformer B. R. Ambedkar (1891–1956), who included all depressed people irrespective of their caste into the definition of dalits. Hence the first group he made was called the "Labour Party" and included as its members all people of the society who were kept depressed, including women, small scale farmers and people from backward castes. 

Dr. Ambedkar fought for a separate electorate for Dalits in Ramsay MacDonald’s Communal Award during British Raj. This award would have ensured adequate representation of Dalit community enabling them to vote for their candidate. 

In 1932, the British Raj recommended separate electorates to select leaders for Dalits in the Communal Award. This was favoured by Ambedkar but when Mahatma Gandhi opposed the proposal it resulted in the Poona Pact. That in turn influenced the Government of India Act, 1935, which introduced the reservation of seats for the Depressed Classes, now renamed as Scheduled Castes. 
Dalit (from Sanskrit ‘dal’ which means to split, to crack, to break) is the name given to a group of people who have been historically considered outcasts in Hindu societies from South Asia (India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh) and Eastern Africa (Somalia). Today, the Dalits, formerly known as "Chandala" (Untouchables), have increasingly adopted the term “Dalit” as their way out of the social segregation imposed by the caste system.
New leaders like Kanhaiya Kumar subscribe to this definition of "dalits", thus a Brahmin marginal farmer trying to eke out a living, but unable to do so also falls in the "dalit" category. Ambedkar himself was a Mahar, and in the 1970s the use of the word "dalit" was invigorated when it was adopted by the Dalit Panthers activist group. Gradually, political parties used it to gain mileage.

Untouchability, is an ancient form of discrimination based upon caste. It is not merely the inability to touch a human being but also an attitude towards a minority group translated into various physical acts, norms and practices.

The Dalit status carried with it the stigma of “untouchability” because it is associated with menial, degrading tasks immediately connected with their traditional occupations which include skinning dead cows or buffaloes, unclogging sewers, disposing of dead bodies of livestock and cleaning latrines.

The discrimination against the Dalits takes various forms such as:

The rate of literacy among the Dalits, as per 1991 census, was 37.41% as compared to 57.69% for non-Dalits.
Untouchability in schools has contributed to drop-out and illiteracy levels for Dalit children. The 1991 census of India reported that Dalit communities were one of the least literate social groups in the country, with only 30% of Dalit children recognized to have basic reading and writing skills.

Half of India's Dalit children are undernourished, 21% are 'severely underweight', and 12% die before their 5th birthday. Between 1998-1999 at least 50% of Dalit women suffered from anemia. High morbidity and child mortality are firmly linked to their low quality of life imposed by poverty, educational status and discrimination.

There have been many attempts to neutralize the caste-based discrimination. In the 1930s, the teachings of B. R. Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi began to change attitudes towards the Dalit minority. In 1949 ‘Untouchability’ was outlawed by the Indian constitution and Indian law does not permit the practice of a caste system. Discrimination against the Dalit minority has become an important human rights and political issue. Even so, in rural areas the Dalits are still facing the consequences of the slow and steady decline of discrimination.

Today, the Dalit movements (The Dalit Panther Movement, the Dalit Mahasabha and the Dalit Sangharsh Samithi) which have emerged during the 20th century continue to struggle for equality and implementation of Communal Award. The progress of the past few decades shows hope for an improved level of equality within Indian society. In 1997, Kocheril Raman Narayanan became the
first Dalit to have been elected President of India Another important political figure was Mayawati Kumari, the leader of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) which represents the Dalits. She has been elected four times as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state.

The National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights (NCDHR) established in 1998 by Dalit human rights activists, is one of many organizations committed to the elimination of caste discrimination. It's main objectives are "“to hold the State accountable for all Human Rights violations committed against Dalits; to sensitize civil society by raising visibility of the Dalit problem; and to render justice to Dalit victims of discrimination and violence.”"
The International Dalit Solidarity Network, which was established in 2000, is another organization concerned about caste discrimination and similar forms of discrimination based on work and descent. It has emerged as a network of national solidarity groups from affected countries such as those in South Asia and even West Africa.


Mesosaurus

Mesosaurus is an extinct marine reptile from the early Permian of southern Africa and South America. It was one of the first known marine reptiles, and had many adaptations to a fully aquatic lifestyle. 

It is sometimes considered an anapsid, but there is some disagreement about that. It is described by Benton as a 'parareptile', that is, a sauropsid.

"Mesosaurus" was one of the first reptiles to return to the water after early tetrapods came to land in the later Devonian. 

It was around in length, with webbed feet, a streamlined body, and a long tail that may have supported a fin. It probably propelled itself through the water with its long hind legs and flexible tail. Its body was also flexible and could easily move sideways, but it had heavily thickened ribs, which would have prevented it from twisting its body. Specimens show it was viviparous, bearing live young.

"Mesosaurus" had a small skull with long jaws. The nostrils were located at the top, allowing the creature to breathe with only the upper side of its head breaking the surface. Its teeth were suitable for catching small nektonic prey such as crustaceans.

"Mesosaurus" was significant in providing evidence for the theory of continental drift, because its remains were found in southern Africa and eastern South America, two far away places. As "Mesosaurus" was a coastal animal, and therefore could not have crossed the Atlantic Ocean, this distribution indicated that the two continents used to be joined together.

Bokbunja ju

Bokbunja ju (hangul: 복분자주; hanja: 覆盆子酒; also spelled bokbunjaju, bokbunja-ju, or bokbunjajoo, and also called bokbunja wine) is a Korean traditional wine made from fermented Korean black raspberries called "bokbunja" (hangul: 복분자; hanja: ; "Rubus coreanus"). It is made by fermenting berries with water.

"Bokbunja ju" is crimson in color and sweet. It has between 15% and 19% alcohol by volume, depending on the brand. Koreans believe that it is good for health and promotes male sexual stamina. It is often drunk on special occasions.

Hangwa

A hangwa is a Korean traditional cookie. Hangwa includes Yumilgwa Yugwa, Dasik Dasik and Yeot Gangjeong. Hangwa is also called "Jogwa" since it is made of diverse grains and looks like fruits. 

Hangwa was very popular among people over the Shilla and Goryeo because the yield of grains had went up a lot and people tried not to eat meat for religious reasons. The religion at that time was Buddhism. Since then, Hangwa has become necessary in wedding ceremonies, memorial sacrifice days, and social dinners.

The basic materials of Hangwa are mostly natural and based on the materials Hangwa is primarily divided into seven kinds and the recipes are slightly different.

Hangwa does not go bad easily because it is very good at preservation. This comes from the fermentation of grains and use of honey. Also, Hangwa is very nutritious. Ancestors thought that food was natural medicine and the idea was reflected on the nutrition of Hangwa too. Also, Hangwa shows Korean traditional virtue and emotions. It represents the warmth of neighbors. In ancient times, when people had ceremonies or social meetings, they made their guest go back with some food, which was mostly Tteok and Hangwa. In other words, Hangwa talks about the kindness and the affection between people in Korea.



Verdin

The Verdin ("Auriparus flaviceps") is a small bird. It is the only species in the genus "Auriparus", and the only species in the family found in the New World.

The Verdin is a very small bird. At 4.5 inches in length, it rivals the Bushtit as one of the smallest passerines in North America. It is gray overall, and adults have a bright yellow head and rusty "shoulder patch" (the lesser coverts). Unlike the tits, it has a sharply pointed bill.

Verdins are insectivores. They keep looking among the desert trees and scrubs. They usually live alone except when they pair up to make their nests. They are very friendly birds. Verdins occasionally try to get tidbits of dried sugar water from hummingbird feeders.

Verdins always have and will live in southwestern United States and northern Mexico, ranging from southeastern California to Texas, throughout Baja California and into central Mexico, north of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.

Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt

The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt "(Eje Volcánico Transversal)" also known as the Transvolcanic Belt and locally as the Sierra Nevada (Snowy Mountain Range), is a volcanic belt that extends 900 km from west to east across central-southern Mexico.

Several of its highest peaks have snow all year long, and during clear weather, they can be seen bythose who live in Mexico on the many high plateaus from which these volcanoes rise.

Volcanic belt

A volcanic belt is a large volcanically active place.Other terms are used for smaller areas of activity such as volcanic fields. Volcanic belts are found above zones of very high temperature (700-1400°C) where magma is made by melting of rock in the Earth's crust and upper mantle. These areas usually appear along tectonic plate boundaries at depths of 10-50 km.
The biggest volcanic belt is Pacific Ring of Fire

Sikhae

Sikhae is a salted fermented food with grains in Korean cuisine as one of jeotgal. "Sikhae" is made with various fish, such as flat fish, shellfish, pollack, squid and fish intestines, and cooked grains, such as rice, glutinous rice, glutinous foxtail millet and nonglutinous millet. "Sikhae" is less salty than jeotgal because most jeotgal is made with seafood and salt, but "sikhae" is made with not only the ingredients of jeotgal but also grains, shredded radish, etc. Therefore, "sikhae" is stored for short-term, while jeotgal is able to be stored for rather long-term because of the large amount of salt.

The types of "sikhae" can be different, depending on the main ingredients, regions, what the family and the person like. In past times, because of the limited transportation, regions near the sea had more types of "sikhae" compared to the inland areas. Koreans usually eat this food as a banchan (small dishes of food).

"Sikhae" was not included in any literature before the early part of the Korean Joseon Dynasty. However, that doesn't mean there was not "sikhae" and rather it guesses that "sikhae" was not written down. After the middle of Joseon Dynasty, "sikhae" have been mentioned in literature.

Sikhae is made with fish, salt, cooked rice, Korean traditional spices, etc. First, wash fishes and put drained fishes with salt in a pot. After about 10 days, take the salted fishes out of the pot, cut them into bite-size pieces and then put them with cooked rice and chili powder in the pot again. Lastly, put shredded radish into the pot after another four days and finally eat "sikhae" as 10 more days are passing.

- Gajamisikhae is the typical and popular Korean sikhae. It is made mostly in the region of North Korea. 

Sikhae has a lot of effects. First, sikhae, as one of fermented food, is easily digested by creating peptone, peptide, and free amino acid through the process of decomposition of protein and so good nourishing food for patients, the old and the infirm and children. Also, millet, one of ingredients of Sikhae, helps people warm body in the winter when people have cold hands or feet due to the very cold weather.


Boltzmann constant

The Boltzmann constant ("k" or "k") is a physical constant. It is defined to be J/K. It relates the average kinetic energy of a particle in a gas with the temperature of the gas. It is the gas constant "R" divided by the Avogadro constant "N":

The Boltzmann constant has SI units of J⋅K (also written J/K), the same as entropy. It is named after the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann.

December Boys

December Boys is a 2007 Australian movie. It was directed by Rod Hardy and written by Marc Rosenberg. It was taken from the 1963 novel of the same name by Michael Noonan. It was released on 14 September 2007 in the UK and US and 20 September 2007 in Australia. "December Boys" is Daniel Radcliffe's first non-"Harry Potter" movie role since 2001's "The Tailor of Panama".

Anapsid

An anapsid is an amniote whose skull does not have openings on the sides behind the eyes. This is

Some other groups were anapsids, such as the mesosaurs.

Bushtit

The bushtit ("Psaltriparus minimus") is a long-tailed tit found in North America. It is the only species in the family found in the New World, and the only member of the genus "Psaltriparus".

The bushtit lives in mixed open woodlands. It also lives in parks and gardens. It lives in the western United States and highland parts of Mexico all year, ranging from Vancouver through the Great Basin and the lowlands and foothills of California to southern Mexico and Guatemala.

The bushtit is one of the smallest passerines in North America, at 11 cm in length and 5.3 g in weight. It is gray-brown overall, with a large head, a short neck, a long tail, and a short stubby bill. The male has dark eyes and the adult female, yellow.

The bushtit is active and gregarious, searching for small insects and spiders in mixed-species feeding flocks with species such as chickadees and warblers, of 10 to over 40 birds. Members of the group keep making calls to each other that can be described as a short "tsit".

Duck pond

A duck pond is a pond for ducks and other waterfowl. Duck ponds give habitats for water fowl and other birds who use the water to bathe in and drink. Duck ponds usually attract people who come to feed the ducks.

Diapsid

A diapsid is a reptile with two fenestrae (holes) behind the eye on each side of its skull. Most reptiles are diapsids, and the condition does not occur in mammals. The function of the holes is to improve jaw movements, and to reduce the weight of the skull. The holes give places for muscle attachment; also, as jaw muscles contract, the holes allow space for the muscles to bulge.

The "Allosaurus" skull shows the way the skull became lighter in dinosaurs, especially the large theropods. It is here not much more than a series of struts, yet provides massive bite power.

Some aquatic reptile groups lost the lower of the two openings, leaving just one behind the eye. This is called the euryapsid condition. It is fairly certain that this is secondary, and that the groups were originally diapsids. The groups include:

Weapons of World War I

Major advances were made to weapon technology during World War I. There were better grenades, flame throwers, poison gas, and artillery. The submarine, warplane and the tank were new weapons. 

Both sides used a much better heavy machine gun than they had used before in Europe. Four to six people worked one. They fired 400 to 600 bullets per minute. The machine guns got too hot and needed water on them. This kind of gun was invented in 1884 by Hiram Maxim. The German version was the MG08. The British used the Vickers machine gun, which was very safe and easy to use. The machine guns changed how war went; and killed many soldiers. Because they sometimes got too hot, they could be slow. In case that one of the crew of the machine gun were shot, the whole squad were trained to fill their spot. As the war progressed, more machine guns were used in trench warfare in combination with barbed wire defensive positions, making them the most deadly weapon on the battle field.

The normal British army rifle was the Lee Enfield 0.303. This was made in 1907 by James Lee. The Lee Enfield could fire twelve bullets per minute. The Germans used the Mauser rifle made in 1898 by Paul Mauser. This was an excellent rifle, but it only held five bullets.

Yume Nikki

The game is known for its strange and sometimes scary content, such as an alien who plays piano and a girl who sometimes turns into a monster when you turn off the light.

The game is free, and the official English version was put on Steam.

Madotsuki lives alone in a small apartment with a bed, an old game console, and a desk where she writes a diary of her dreams. The player controls Madotsuki and can move her using the arrow keys. If you make her go to sleep by interacting with the bed, she goes into a dream version of her room. From there, you can make her explore 12 different dream worlds by going through doors that are in a large, dark place north of her room. From these worlds, other dream worlds can be accessed.

To beat the game, the player has to find all 24 "effects" that are hidden in Madotsuki's dreams. Effects cause a change to Madotsuki, like turning her into a witch or making her small. The player can drop them in the main dream area, where they turn into egg-like objects. When they wake up, there is a step-ladder on Madotsuki’s balcony. Walking off it makes Madotsuki jump off the building to her likely death, ending the game.


Eddie Rickenbacker

Edward Vernon Rickenbacker (October 8, 1890 – July 23, 1973) was an American fighter ace in World War I. He was also a Medal of Honor recipient. With 26 aerial victories he was America's most successful fighter ace in the war. He was also a race car driver and automotive designer. He was a government consultant in military matters and a pioneer in airline transport. He was also the longtime head of Eastern Air Lines.

He was born Edward Richenbacher (without a middle name) in Columbus, Ohio. His parents were German-speaking Swiss immigrants. Since childhood he loved machines and experimented with them. He was encouraged by his father's words: "A machine has to have a purpose".

Rickenbacker nearly died many times. He had an early run-in with a horse-drawn carriage, a botched tonsillectomy and multiple airplane crashes. His first near death experience occurred when he was in the "Horsehead Gang". He lived near a mine and they decided to ride a cart down the slope. It tipped over and almost crushed them.

He stopped going to school in grade seven after the accidental death of his father on August 26, 1904. Rickenbacker found jobs to help support the family. Driven by an intense admiration for machines he taught himself as much as he could. This included enrolling in a correspondence course in engineering. He aggressively pursued any chance of involvement with automobiles. Rickenbacker went to work at the Columbus Buggy Company. He eventually becoming a salesman.

Rickenbacker became well known as a race car driver. He competed in the Indianapolis 500 four times before World War I. He earned the nickname "Fast Eddie". He joined the Maxwell Race Team in 1915 after leaving Peugeot. After the Maxwell team disbanded that same year, he joined the Prest-O-Lite team as manager and continued to race improved Maxwells for Prest-O-Lite.

Suncheon

Suncheon is a city in South Korea. It belongs to Jeollanam-do. 70% of Suncheon is composed of mountains and the city has the greatest number of mountains in the province. The average temperature for the year is 12.5℃. The average temperature in January is -0.5℃ and the average temperature in August is 25.2℃. Since Suncheon fronts the southern sea, the city is relatively warm during the winter by the effect of oceanic climate.

Suncheon is famous among Korean travelers due to its beautiful tourist attractions and local food of great taste. Among many spots, Suncheon bay is the most well-known. It was selected as one of the top 5 coastal wetlands in the world. The large mud flat stretches out and several kinds of birds and other living creatures live there. Also, the wide field of reeds along the waterside forms magnificent view. The Suncheon bay reeds festival is held every October and it gets great reputation.

Since the city is located near to the sea, dishes made of diverse fresh fish highly attract those who visit Suncheon. Especially, thanks to the well-protected ecological environment, mudskippers which exist usually in the very clean mud flat are seen in the Suncheon bay. They are used for cooking in Suncheon and the dish is very famous for its greater taste than any other region in the country.

Dean Edwards

Dean Edwards (born July 30, 1970) is an American actor and comedian. Edwards joined the cast of "Saturday Night Live" in 2001. He created several impressions. These include Michael Jackson, Wayne Brady, Chris Tucker, Don Cheadle, Colin Powell, Serena Williams, Nipsey Russell, Denzel Washington, Grace Jones, and Billy Ocean. Chris Tucker was Edwards' first impression. This was also the an impression done by Jay Pharoah on his first "SNL" episode on September 25, 2010. Even though Edwards was very good at impressions, he was not used much during his time working on the program. He left after the program's 28th season. He said it was because of creative differences. He also appeared in "Tony N' Tina's Wedding", "The Sopranos", "Robotomy", and "Scared Shrekless". In "Scared Shrekless" and "Thriller Night", he voiced the part of Donkey.

Many feel that Edwards voice and style is very similar to that of Eddie Murphy. 
On YouTube, Edwards currently has his own channel known as "deanedwardscomedy".

Ice storm

Ice storms are weather phenomena caused by freezing rain. The falling rain comes into contact with surfaces and turns into a thin sheet of ice. Ice storms cause accidents, take power lines down and cause serious damage.

It starts with a layer of warmer (not freezing) air above a layer of huge-freezing temperatures lower down. Frozen precipitation melts to rain while falling into the warm air layer, and then begins to refreeze in the cold layer below.

As of January 1, 2007, Fermilab is operated by the Fermi Research Alliance, a joint venture of the University of Chicago, Illinois Institute of Technology and the Universities Research Association (URA). Fermilab is a part of the Illinois Technology and Research Corridor. 

Fermilab's Tevatron was a landmark particle accelerator; at in circumference, it was the world's second largest energy particle accelerator (CERN's Large Hadron Collider is 27 km in circumference), until being shut down on September 30, 2011. In 1995, two teams at Fermilab (CDF and DØ, detectors which utilize the Tevatron) announced the discovery of the top quark.

In addition to high energy collider physics, Fermilab is also host to a number of smaller fixed-target and neutrino experiments, such as MiniBooNE (Mini Booster Neutrino Experiment), SciBooNE (SciBar Booster Neutrino Experiment) and MINOS (Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search). The MiniBooNE detector is a diameter sphere which contains 800 tons of mineral oil lined with 1520 individual phototube detectors. An estimated 1 million neutrino events are recorded each year. SciBooNE is the newest neutrino experiment at Fermilab; it sits in the same neutrino beam as MiniBooNE but has fine-grained tracking capabilities. The MINOS experiment uses Fermilab's NuMI (Neutrinos at the Main Injector) beam, which is an intense beam of neutrinos that travels through the Earth to the Soudan Mine in Minnesota.

A large piece of land was reserved for Fermilab, but much of the equipment is underground. The Fermilab scientists decided to use the land surface as an experiment in restoring Illinois original prairie. They also started a farm to raise al herd of American bison. The Fermilab Nature Areas is a separate non-profit group that administers these programs.

Asteroid 11998 Fermilab is named in honor of the laboratory.

Between World War II and the 1960s, the federal government funded different particle accelerators at competing universities to build high-energy physics experiments. Most notable were the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC), which sent particles in a straight line, the Brookhaven National Laboratory at SUNY Stoney Brook and the Cornell University synchrotron, which sent particles around in a circle to have the same magnets work on the particles many times. By the 1960s, the cost of building bigger atom smashers were too high to fund each individual campus, and the size of ring for the next circular accelerator would be too large to fit on an existing college campus. So, the federal government decided to start a new location to be run by physicists from several universities. They held a competition to pick a site, but politicians fought for it to be in Illinois.

Weston, Illinois was a community next to Batavia. It was a subdivision of pre-fabricated homes started in the early 1960s. Sales were very slow, so the land developers tried to attract Fermilab to be a new employer on the edge of the new town. However, it turned out that the amount of land needed would swallow up the entire town. So, the town voted to sell all of the land, including the houses that had been built to Fermilab. The town then dissolved.

The laboratory was founded in 1967 as the National Accelerator Laboratory; it was renamed in honor of Enrico Fermi in 1974. The lab's first director was Robert Rathbun Wilson. Wilson made many of the sculptures on the campus. He is attributed as being responsible for it being finished ahead of time and under budget. The high rise laboratory building on the site, the unique shape of which has become the symbol for Fermilab, is named in his honor, and is the center of activity on the campus.

Before the new buildings could be finished, the scientists moved into the Weston houses and also moved all of the farm houses on Fermilab to that location for use as office space. They renamed Weston, "Fermilab Village." It still houses visiting scientists.

Wilson brought in the team that had built the Cornell synchrotron to help build the original 200 GeV accelerator. Two important inventions made this accelerator obsolete: superconducting magnets and using the same acclerator ring to send two groups of particles around in opposite directions so that when the collide they would have twice the energy.

After Wilson stepped down in 1978 to protest the lack of funding for the lab, Leon M. Lederman took on the job. It was under his guidance that the original accelerator was replaced with the Tevatron accelerator. The new accelerator was capable of colliding proton and an antiproton at a combined energy of 1.96 TeV. Lederman stepped down in 1988 and remains Director Emeritus. The on-site science education center (which serves students and the general public) was named in his honor.

From 1988 to 1998, the lab was run by John Peoples. From that time until June 30, 2005, the lab was run by Michael S. Witherell. On November 19, 2004 Piermaria Oddone, formerly of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, was announced as Fermilab's newest director. Oddone began his term as director July 1, 2005.

Fermilab continues to participate in the work in the LHC including serving as a Tier 1 site in the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid. The State of Illinois is funding a new Illinois Accelerator Research Center building at Fermilab for scientists and industrial partners.

The first stage in the acceleration process takes place in the Cockcroft–Walton generator. It involves taking hydrogen gas and turning it into H ions by introducing it into a container lined with molybdenum electrodes: a matchbox-sized, oval-shaped cathode and a surrounding anode, separated by 1 mm and held in place by glass ceramic insulators. A magnetron is used to generate a plasma to form H near the metal surface. A 750 keV electrostatic field is applied by the Cockcroft–Walton generator, and the ions are accelerated out of the container. The next step is the linear accelerator (or linac), which accelerates the particles to 400 MeV, or about 70% of the speed of light. Right before entering the next accelerator, the H ions pass through a carbon foil, becoming H ions (protons).

The next step is the booster ring. The booster ring is a 468 m circumference circular accelerator that uses magnets to bend beams of protons in a circular path. The protons coming from the Linac travel around the Booster about 20,000 times in 33 milliseconds so that they repeatedly experience electric fields. With each revolution the protons pick up more energy, leaving the Booster with 8 GeV. The Main Injector is the next link in the accelerator chain. Completed in 1999, it has become Fermilab's "particle switchyard" with three functions: it accelerates protons, it delivers protons for antiproton production, and it accelerates antiprotons coming from the antiproton source. The final accelerator was the Tevatron. It was the second most powerful particle accelerator in the world (CERN's Large Hadron Collider being the most powerful). Traveling at almost the speed of light, protons and antiprotons circle the Tevatron in opposite directions. Physicists coordinate the beams so that they collide at the centers of two 5,000-ton detectors DØ and CDF inside the Tevatron tunnel at energies of 1.96 TeV, revealing the conditions of matter in the early universe and its structure at the smallest scale. The Tevatron is being converted into a museum.

The linear accelerator also has a medical treatment facility. Doctors treat people with cancer by shooting protons or neutrons from the accelerator into their tumors.



Heterojunction bipolar transistor

The heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) is a type of bipolar junction transistor (BJT) which uses different semiconductor materials for the emitter and base regions, making a heterojunction. The HBT can handle signals of much higher frequencies, (up to several hundred GHz) than BJT. HBT is commonly used in modern ultrafast circuits, mostly radio-frequency (RF) systems, and in applications requiring a high power efficiency, such as RF power amplifiers in mobile phones. The idea of using a heterojunction is as old as the conventional BJT, dating back to a patent from 1951.

The principal difference between the BJT and HBT is in the use of different semiconductor materials for the emitter and base regions, making a heterojunction. This limits the injection of holes from the base into the emitter region, since the potential barrier in the valence band is higher than in the conduction band. Unlike BJT technology, this allows a high doping density to be used in the base. The high doping density reduces the base resistance while maintaining gain. The efficiency of the heterojunction is measured by the Kroemer factor.


Wet chemistry

Wet chemistry studies chemical reactions that occur in the liquid phase. It is also called bench chemistry because many of the tests performed are done at a lab bench.

Wet chemistry uses laboratory glassware, such as beakers and flasks, without quantitative chemical analysis using instrumentation. Many high school and college laboratories teach students basic wet chemistry methods.

Before the age of theoretical and computational chemistry, it was the main form of scientific discovery in the chemical field. So, some people call wet chemistry classic chemistry or classical chemistry. Today's society and quality control requirements need a high volume of wet chemistry. So, many wet chemistry methods have been automated and computerized for faster analysis.

Wet chemistry techniques can be used for qualitative chemical measurements, such as changes in color (colorimetry), but often involves more quantitative chemical measurements, using methods such as gravimetry and titrimetry. Some uses for wet chemistry include tests for:


Wet chemistry is also used in environmental chemistry settings and is used for to test:


It can also involve the elemental analysis of samples, e.g., water sources, for items like:



Korean Canadian

Korean Canadians are Canadians of Korean descent. According to South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, there are 223,322 Koreans or people of Korean ancestry in Canada. This is the fourth-largest population of Koreans outside of Korea (after Koreans in Japan and ahead of Koreans in Russia). Also, the government of South Korean guessed that there are more than 100,000 Koreans living in Canada illegally.

The first Koreans who came to Canada were Christians. They were sent by Canadian missionaries to study Christianity in Canada. Not many stayed in Canada though; and in 1965, the total Korean population of Canada was only about 70 people. However, after 1966's change of Canadian immigration laws, South Korean immigration to Canada grew. Between 1970 and 1980, 18,148 Koreans immigrated to Canada, and another 17,583 came in the 1990s. In the late 1990s, South Korea became the fifth-largest source of immigrants to Canada. Toronto has the most Koreans in Canada, but Vancouver has the highest growth rate of Koreans. They have increased 69% since 1996. Montreal has the third-most Korean immigrants at this time. In 2001, More Koreans went to Canada than to the United States. The number of temporary residents also grew after the Canadian government made visas not necessary; South Korea sent the most international students to Canada in the late 1990s. Many of the Koreans who came to Canada, came from the Korean population in China.

In the 1990s, many Koreans came to Canada because unemployment was high and income growth was low. It was the opposite in the United States at this time. They also came because the Canadian dollar was very weak, so they could get a lot of Canadian money from their Korean money. In the USA, they could get less American dollars. So they had more money if they came to Canada Lastly, in Korea at the time there was lots of anti-American feelings, and also many local native teachers came from Canada, so Koreans knew Canadians very well. .

Many Koreans in Canada are well educated, and many new immigrants and their children are skilled workers such as—doctors, professors, engineers, computer technicians—or businessmen.

Korean Canadians are usually one of three types: first generation immigrants, the “1.5” generation who began their schooling in Korea but moved to Canada in their childhood or teen years, and the second generation born in Canada. Each group is very unique, but Korean Canadians are very loyal to their Korean culture. They do this by local culture activities, university and alumni groups, seniors’ groups, language schools and business contacts. Vancouver and Toronto have Korean-language newspapers, and Korean television and radio programs. Korean dance, music art, as well as martial arts and Korean cuisine, are very popular in Canada.

Today, many Korean Canadians are Christians, and often attend Korean churches. A small number are Buddhist or are not religious. 

Statistics were researched in 2007 by the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The statistics showed that among Koreans living in Canada, 86,084 are Canadian citizens, 72,077 are permanent residents, 20,738 people have student visas, and 19,271 other people are temporary residents. The Canada 2001 Census said that there are 101,715 Canadians of Korean descent, but Korean community leaders and the media think that there are more than this. A big group could be temporary students studying English. According to the Canada 1996 Census, 53.6% of Korean immigrants to Canada graduated from University, compared to 23% of other Canadians. However, because Canadian employers prefer degrees from Canada, Korean immigrants often do jobs that are not what they studied in Korea; 40% worked in family-owned businesses, and their average income is only 67% of other Canadian's income.


Placodont

Placodonts were a group of Triassic marine reptiles which had heavy flat teeth. These teeth were used for crushing shellfish. Placodonts are in the Order Sauropterygia, the group that includes Plesiosaurs. Placodonts were mostly between in length, up to a maximum long. They are found in marine sediments of the Middle and Upper Triassic, 235–250 million years ago.

The first specimen was discovered in 1830, and the group was very widely distributed. Shellfish were common throughout the Mesozoic period, but this group of shellfish-eaters went extinct at the end of the Triassic. They were clearly a victim of some event which disturbed their lifestyle. The end-Triassic had several extinction events which are not well understood.

The earliest forms like Placodus, in the early to middle Triassic, looked rather barrel-shaped. Later placodonts had bony plates on their backs which protected their bodies while they were feeding.

By the Upper Triassic, these plates had grown so that some placodonts of the time looked like the sea turtles of modern day. Other placodonts developed plates that resembled the shells of horseshoe crabs and trilobites rather than those of sea turtles. These adaptations are examples of convergent evolution. 

Because of their dense bone and heavy armour plating, these creatures would have been too heavy to float in the ocean. They would have used a lot of energy to reach the water surface. For this reason, and because of the type of sediment found with the fossils, it is suggested placodonts lived in shallow waters and not in deep oceans.

The placodonts ate shellfish. Their front teeth stuck out: they would be used to dig up the shellfish, and pull them from any attachment to the ground. Inside their mouth, the teeth were large and flat: they were used to crush the shells.

Their diet consisted of marine bivalves, brachiopods, and other invertebrates.

Becoming Jane

Becoming Jane is a movie directed by Julian Jarrold in 2007. The setting of this movie is Hampshire, England in the 1700s. The movie’s story was based on a fictional biography written by Jon Spence. Anne Hathaway played Jane Austen. James McAvoy played Thomas Lefroy. This movie won the 2007 People's Choice Award for "Favorite Independent Movie". It was nominated for 2008 Ivor Novello Award for Best Original Film Score.

Jane (played by Anne Hathaway) is a writer. She lives in a rural area. Her father is a pastor of small church. Her her family is poor. She is under a lot of stress since her mother wants her to marry Mr. Wisley (Laurence Fox). He is the nephew of the wealthy Lady Gresham (Maggie Smith).

Meanwhile, Thomas Lefroy (played by James McAvoy) is working with his uncle as a lawyer in London. He is ordered to go Hampshire due to his dissipated life. When they meet the first time, Tom criticizes Jane’s works and she becomes angry about that. Both of them have hostile feelings toward each other. However, the feelings changes into affection as they meet several times. Finally they decide to marry. With a lot of expectation, they visits Tom’s uncle Judge Langlois. The uncle does not approve of the marriage due to Jane’s poverty. They break up, but since they love each other deeply, they elope. But after knowing about the fact that Tom is the only hope of his family, Jane gives up their elopement and leaves to go home.

Twenty years later, Jane becomes famous writer and after a gathering, Jane and Tom meet again. There, Tom is with his daughter who likes Jane’s book a lot. His daughter asks Jane to read the novel. To stop her Tom called his daughter’s name – Jane. Knowing that Tom named his daughter after her, Jane accepts her request and reads her book, "Pride and Prejudice".

Steven Chu

Steven Chu (born February 28, 1948) is an American physicist. He was the 12th United States Secretary of Energy from 2009 to 2013. Chu is known for his research at Bell Labs in cooling and trapping of atoms with laser light, which won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997, along with his scientific colleagues Claude Cohen-Tannoudji and William Daniel Phillips. 

Chu is the first Nobel Prize winner and the second Chinese American to hold a post in the United States Cabinet. Before becoming the United States Secretary of Energy, he was a professor of physics and molecular and cellular biology at the University of California, Berkeley. He was also the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 

Before teaching at Berkeley, he was a professor of physics at Stanford University. He has argued for more research into alternative energy and nuclear power. He thinks the world should shift away from fossil fuels to help with climate change. For example, he discusses a global "glucose economy". This is a form of a low-carbon economy, in which glucose from tropical plants is shipped around like oil is today.

Chu was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He has ancestry from Taicang, Jiangsu. He attended and graduated from Garden City High School. He received both a B.A. in mathematics and a B.S. in physics in 1970 from the University of Rochester. He went on to earn his Ph.D. in physics from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1976.

He wrote a paper on gravitational redshift published in "Nature" (463, 926–929) in Feb 2010 and a second one co-authored in July 2010.

Under his leadership in 2010 the Department of Energy updated the water usage regulations on toilets and showers.

His nomination to be Secretary of Energy was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate on January 20, 2009. On January 21, 2009, Chu was sworn in as Secretary of Energy in the Barack Obama administration. 

In March 2011 Chu said that federal regulators should not delay approving licenses for construction for planned U.S. nuclear power plants because of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. "I think those things can proceed", Chu told reporters on Capital Hill, referring to construction license applications pending at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

In August 2011, Chu praised an advisory panel’s report on curbing the environmental risks of natural-gas development. Chu responded to the panel’s report on hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing breaks up rock to get more oil and gas out of the ground. The report recommendations include: greater data collection of air and water data, “rigorous” air pollution standards and mandatory disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. “The report ... recommends a range of tools for implementing these measures, including regulation, continuous improvement in best practices by industry, and ongoing research and development,” Chu said in a statement. “I will be working closely with my colleagues in the Administration to review the recommendations and to chart a path for continued development of this vital energy resource in a safe manner,” he added.

Republicans in Congress have accused Chu for changing a US$535 million federal loan to Solyndra, an energy company. When the company went bankrupt in 2011, the government lost the money. A House Energy and Commerce subcommittee asked Chu in 2011 about the loan.


Pororo the Little Penguin

Pororo the Little Penguin is a Clockwork Zoo 3D computer animation series planned by Iconix Entertainment. Each season has 52 episodes and three seasons have been aired in South Korea until now. In 2003, Season 1 was aired in 27 November 2003 on the Korean channel, EBS. In the beginning, 22 episodes of season 1 were made by North Korean company, Samcholli. About 110 countries imported Pororo and aired it. Pororo is so loved by children in Korea and he is perceived as an idol of children, so he is called Bbo-tong-ryung (뽀통령 in Korean) which means president Pororo.

Pororo and little animal friends live together in the town covered all over with snow and ice. Pororo, a little curious penguin, and his friends are all different, so great and small commotions occur in this little town. Then one day, when Pororo and his friends hang out as usual, they find novelty egg under a tree in the woods. Pororo takes that egg to his house. Surprisingly, the egg hatches out and the little dinosaur is born, whose name is Crong. Crong becomes new friends of Pororo.

Queen Seondeok of Silla

Queen Seondeok of Silla (606 – 8 January 647) was 27th ruler of Silla, one of the three ancient kingdoms of Korea. She was a daughter of King Jinpyeong and Lady Maya of the Kim clan. Because King Jinpyeong did not have any sons, Queen Seondeok became the first female ruler in Korean history after her father died. Besides the name Seondeok, she was also called Sung-Jo Hwang-Go which means "sacred and dedicated queen".

Queen Seondeok was an intelligent and capable ruler who established the foundation of Silla's unity of Korea peninsula. She ruled her kingdom wisely and improved her people’s life. Also, she made a lot of effort to accept advanced culture of ancient China by sending international students and monks. The star-gazing tower named Cheomseongdae and wooden tower with nine floors in Hwangnyongsa temple are the results of her effort.

According to some legend (in Korean history book "Samguk Sagi") related to her, Queen Seondeok had great intuition and foresight. She noticed where the enemy was hiding by natural phenomena, predicted many incidents before it happened, and even knew when she would die a couple of days ago and left her will before death. Because of her extraordinary and heroic life, many Korean people make novels, plays, musicals and so on till now.

Styx Records

Styx Records is an Austrian record label. It was founded in 1999 by the former drummer of the Mojo Blues Band, Peter Müller. The label focuses on blues, rhythm&blues and boogie woogie from Austria.

Disability Discrimination Act 1995

The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (c 50) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which has now been repealed and replaced by the Equality Act 2010 (), except in Northern Ireland where the Act still applies. Formerly, it made it unlawful to discriminate against people in respect of their disabilities in relation to employment, the provision of goods and services, education and transport. 

Pachypleurosaur

Pachypleurosaurs were primitive sauropterygian reptiles that vaguely resembled aquatic lizards, and were limited to the Triassic period. They were long animals, ranging in size from 20 cm to about four metres in length, with small heads, long necks, paddle-like limbs, and long deep tails. The limb girdles are greatly reduced, so it is unlikely these animals could move about on land. The widely spaced peg-like teeth project at the front of the jaws, indicate that these animals fed on fish.

Pachypleurosaurs are usually included among the Nothosaurs. 

Harrington Hump

The Harrington Hump is a modular and easy-to-install system by which the height of a railway platform can be increased at relatively low cost. The system takes its name from the Harrington railway station, which was the location of the first production version. Harrington Humps are slowly being installed on other UK railway stations.

Seven Sisters Road

Seven Sisters Road is a road in north London, England. The road runs within the boroughs of Islington, Hackney and Haringey. It is an extension of Camden Road, and runs from Holloway Road (the A1 road) at the Nags Head crossroads then on to another crossroads with Blackstock Road and Stroud Green Road. It carries on uphill alongside Finsbury Park to Manor House, and from there downhill to the junction with Tottenham High Road (the A10 road) at Seven Sisters Corner. The road was authorised in 1829 and constructed in 1833 by the Metropolitan Turnpike Trust. Seven Sisters Road is part of the A503. The stretch running past Finsbury Park is open to the park on the west side, and on the east side are large Victorian villas now used mainly as hotels.

Indigo bunting

The indigo bunting ("Passerina cyanea") is a small seed-eating bird. It is migratory. Its range is from southern Canada to northern Florida during the breeding season, and from southern Florida to northern South America during the winter. It often migrates by night, using the stars to navigate. Its habitat is farmland, brush areas, and open woodland. The indigo bunting is closely related to the lazuli bunting. 

The indigo bunting is a small bird, with a length of 11.5–13 cm (4.5–5 in). The male is a vibrant blue in the summer and a brown color during the winter months, while the female is brown year-round. The male displays brightly colored plumage during the breeding season to attract a mate. Nest-building and incubation are done solely by the female. The diet of the indigo bunting is insects during the summer months and seeds during the winter months.

The Railway Magazine

The Railway Magazine is a monthly British railway magazine, aimed at the railway enthusiast market, that has been published in London since July 1897. it has been, for three years running, the railway magazine with the largest circulation in the U.K., having a monthly average sale during 2009 of 34,715 (the figure for 2007 being 34,661). It was published by IPC Media until October 2010, with ISSN 0033-8923, and in 2007 won IPC's 'Magazine of the Year' award. From November 2010, The Railway Magazine is now published by Mortons Media Group Ltd. (Mortons of Horncastle).



London Transport Board

The London Transport Board was the organisation responsible for public transport in London, England, United Kingdom, and its environs from 1963-1969. In common with all London transport authorities from 1933 to 2000, the public name and operational brand of the organisation was London Transport.



Northern shoveler

The northern shoveler (; Anas clypeata) is a common and widespread duck. It breeds in northern areas of Europe and Asia and across most of North America, and is a rare vagrant to Australia. In North America, it breeds along the southern edge of Hudson Bay and west of this body of water, and as far south as the Great Lakes west to Colorado, Nevada, and Oregon.

The northern shoveler is one of the species to which the "Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds" (AEWA) applies. The conservation status is Least Concern.

Stiff-tailed duck

The stiff-tailed ducks are part of the Oxyurinae subfamily of ducks. All have, as their name implies, long stiff tail feathers, which are erect when the bird is at rest. All have relatively large swollen bills.

These are freshwater diving ducks. Their legs are set far back, making them awkward on land, so they rarely leave the water.

Their unusual displays involve drumming noises from inflatable throat-sacs, head throwing, and erecting short crest.

Feather sequences are complicated, and it is hard to tell how old one of these ducks is. Feathers are vital for survival because of this animals tendency to spend time in the water. Without feathers this duck would die of hypothermia because it could not regulate its body temperature.

Kyōhō











Noteworty coins were minted during this era, including the gold "ōban" and "koban".



Tteokbokki

Tteokbokki () is a Korean traditional food which has sticks of rounded rice cake as the main ingredient. ' "tteok" ' is the Korean word for rice cake and 'bokki' is the Korean word for something fried.

Tteokbokki is divided into gungjung tteokbokki and general tteokbokki as one of Korean street foods.

Gungjung tteokbokki () is made by frying beef and rice cake with soy sauce. It was developed in "gungjung" which means a Korean court.

General tteokbokki is cooked with seasoning using gochujang with starch syrup or sugar for the sweet taste. Generally gungjung tteokbokki uses beef and vegetable because it was cooked at court but general tteokbokki uses fish cake, green onions and boiled egg.

jja-jang tteokbokki () is a stir-fried dish with jjajang.

In a cook book named 'Siuijeonseo' which was written in late 1800s, there is a record of tteokbokki. However, tteokbokki might have existed before the late 1800s because the main ingredient is rice cake and there were rice cakes during the Three Kingdoms of Korea period.
Gungjung tteokbokki is different from tteokbokki because there were no red peppers in Joseon Dynasty so they made gungjung tteokbokki with vegetables and meats. Modern tteokbokki was first made by Mabokrim who has sold tteokbokki with gochujang since 1953.

Hōreki

, also known as Horyaku, was a after "Kan'en" and before "Meiwa." The period started in October 1751 and ended in June 1764. During this time, the emperor and emperess were and .

The "nengō" "Hōreki" means "Valuable Calendar" or "Valuable Almanac". This time frame was created by Emperor Momozono in 1754.

The previous era ended in 1751 ("Kan'en 4, 27th day of the 10th month"); however, this nengō was created years later. By Imperial command, the era was re-named on December 2, 1754, which then became 19th day of the 10th month of the 4th year of Hōreki.



South African Republic

The South African Republic (Dutch: "Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek", ZAR), often informally called the Transvaal Republic, was a sovereign state in southern Africa ruled by the Afrikaners. It was defeated by the UK and its colonies, the British Cape Colony and the Colony of Natal in the Second Boer War and became the British colony of Transvaal.

Inland sea

Inland seas, also called epeiric or epicontinental seas, are shallow seas over part of a continent.

They usually happen with marine transgressions, when the sea overtops the land. They are caused by either global high ('eustatic') sea level or the formation of large geologic basins which eventually connect to the ocean.

There have been, at some periods, shallow seas "inside" continents. Much of present-day North America was covered by an epicontinental sea called the Sundance Sea during the Jurassic period. In the Cretaceous an even larger area was covered by the Western Interior Seaway. A modern example is the Baltic Sea. The North Sea is not an inland sea, but it does sit on continental shelf, and so is epeiric (that is what the word means). The Hudson Bay is often considered an epeiric sea because its depth averages 100ft (30 m) whereas, for example, the Bay of Bengal is 2,600 metres (8000 ft) deep. So epeiric seas are on the continental plate, as are inland seas. The inland seas, however, are more enclosed.

The Amazon basin originally emptied into the Pacific Ocean when South America and Africa were part of Gondwana.

After the breakup of Gondwana, the Amazon found its exit blocked by the rise of the Andes about 15 million years ago (mya). A great inland sea developed, at times draining north through what is now Venezuela before finding its present eastward outlet into the South Atlantic. Gradually this inland sea became a vast freshwater lake and wetlands where sediment flattened its profiles and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater. Over 20 species of stingray, most closely related to those found in the Pacific Ocean, live today in the freshwaters of the Amazon, which is also home to a freshwater dolphin.

The Mediterranean Sea looks like a clear-cut example of an inland sea, but its deepest point is 5,267 m (17,280 ft) in the Calypso Deep of the Ionian Sea. The Mediterranean is a genuine sea which has been squashed almost out of existence by the movement of Africa against the European tectonic plate. It was formerly part of the ancient Tethys Ocean, which surrounded the old global supercontinent of Pangaea. So the Mediterranean is different from those inland seas which sit on top of continental plates.

The Black Sea, on the other hand, is a genuine inland sea because it sits on continental plates which have subsided.

A vast inland sea extended from the Gulf of Mexico deep into present-day Canada during the Cretaceous. It split the continent of North America into two halves, Laramidia and Appalachia, for most of the mid- and late-Cretaceous period. It was 2,500 feet (760 m) deep, 600 miles (970 km) wide and over 2,000 miles (3,200 km) long.

At the same time, much of the low plains of modern-day northern France and northern Germany were covered by an inland sea, where the chalk was deposited that gave the Cretaceous Period its name.

The Sundance Sea existed in North America during the mid to late Jurassic period of the Mesozoic Era. It was an arm of what is now the Arctic Ocean, and extended through what is now western Canada into the central western United States. The sea receded when highlands to the west began to rise. The sedimentary rocks which formed in and around the Sundance Sea are often rich in fossils.


Daruma doll

The doll is a hollow, round, traditional Japanese doll. It is modeled after Bodhidharma, the founder of the Zen sect of Buddhism.

The Daruma dolls are a kind of toy ("omocha"). The Daruma figurine is also a tumbler doll or roly-poly toy. When the doll is tumbled about, it rights itself. The two were well recognized as synonymous by the mid-19th century. Today, Daruma dolls are widely known, regardless of religion or sect.

Most daruma dolls are made of papier mache, and weighted at the bottom so the doll stands. The dolls are typically painted red. Darumas are sold with the eyes being white. Most daruma dolls are made in Takasaki City at the center of Japan. A fair is held in early January every year for the sale of darumas. Daruma dolls are symbols of good luck and business prosperity.

Dolls are sold without the eyes painted in. The custom is to make a resolution or a wish and darken the left eye of the daruma. When the resolution or the wish is fulfilled, the right eye is also darkened. This custom is seen widely today especially in the case of election or entrance examination in.

Viña del Mar

Viña del Mar is a Chilean city and commune with 286.931 inhabitants (2002 census). It was created in 1878.


Suzuki Choinori

Choinori ("riding nearby" in Japanese) is a scooter built by Suzuki. 

It was launched at 2003 for 59,800 Yen. Reducing the size and not using any high cost parts were the secret to low price. However, because of cutting costs, they do not have rear suspension and the maximum speed is around . It also has an aluminum four-stroke 50 cc engine. The special thing about the engine is that it weighs 40% less than other four-stroke engines. It also make the scooter lighter and cheaper. 

Due to its low price, it was a great hit in Japan. However, Suzuki stopped producing Choinori in 2007 because it failed to pass the new gas emission standards.


Meiwa

The "nengō" "Meiwa" means "Radiant Harmony".











Mourning

Mourning refers to process of grieving. This almost always happens at funerals whenever a loved one passes away.
Mourning is also seen when things someone loves gets lost, although not as often. Most commonly seen is sadness, but typically a less intense but longer lasting feeling. Similar to melancholy. Mourning is only seen when a person (or animal, important object, or goal) is lost. Death is most commonly associated. Mourning is not just found in humans, but also in animals. Many birds have a sense of mourning when their mate dies. 

The word is used for behaviour in which the bereaved follow. Wearing black clothes is common in many countries, though other forms of dress are seen. 


Independent record label

An independent record label is a company which musicians can use to make and sell records. These companies are different from major record labels because they are smaller and don't operate under any major businesses.

Some examples of independent record labels are:

An'ei

The "nengō" "An'ei" means "Eternal Tranquility" or "Peaceful and Long".




Take

A take is a performance which is continuously recorded. The word is used in movies and music to track the stages of production.

In movie-making, a take means each filmed "version" of a shot. Takes of each shot are generally numbered starting with "take one" and the number of each take after that is increased (with the director calling for "take two", "take three", "take four", etc.) until the filming of the shot is finished.

Lizzy Pattinson

Elizabeth "Lizzy" Pattinson is an English singer and songwriter.

Lizzy has a sister, Victoria and brother, actor Robert Pattinson.

Lizzy has performed with the UK dance act Aurora and German duo Milk & Sugar. She was lead vocalist for them on Milk & Sugar's No. 1 "Billboard" Hot Dance Club Play track "Let The Sun Shine". She has had three Top 20 hits in the UK.

In 2008 Lizzy recorded background vocals for the movie "Twilight". She is heard on the track "Who Are They?" by Carter Burwell.

The "nengō" "Kansei" means "Lenient Government".




Pontoise

Pontoise is a commune of the Val-d'Oise department in the northwestern suburbs of Paris, France. It is from the centre of Paris, in the "new town" of Cergy-Pontoise.

Pontoise is twinned with:

Fuse

A fuse is a device that shuts off the power to an electrical circuit when too much electric current flows through it. This usually happens when too many appliances are plugged in or when there is a short circuit. A fuse is made as an intentional weak spot in a circuit that will melt (or "blow") when too much current is flowing through it, shutting off the power to the rest of the circuit. This protects the rest of the circuit. After the fuse blows, the problem that caused it to blow must be corrected and the fuse must be replaced to restore power to the circuit. A circuit breaker does the same job as a fuse, but it can be reset without replacing anything.

Fuses in plugs are made in standard ratings. The most common are 3 A, 5 A and 13 A. The fuse should be rated at a slightly higher current than the device needs. e.g. if the device works a 3 A use 5 A fuse. Fast and slow fuses are made. Fast acting fuses blow immediately once the current rating is exceeded. Slow blow fuses will let the current exceed the rating for a fraction of a second, to allow devices like motors to start up.


Naengmyeon

Naengmyeon is a traditional Korean summer food. The name means "cold noodles". Naengmyeon’s basic ingredients are flour, a boiled egg, slices of cucumber and slices of boiled meat. Water or gochujang can be added depending on the type of Naengmyeon. There are many kinds of noodles made from wheat, buckwheat, potatoes or sweet potatoes. 

According to the 19th century writings, it has been made since the Joseon Dynasty. It began as a delicacy in northern Korea. It was popular in the cities of Pyongyang and Hamhung in North Korea. Naengmyeon became widely popular in Korea after the Korean War.

The two main types of naengmyeon are "mul naengmyeon" and "bibim naengmyeon". Mul naengmyeon is served as a cold soup with the noodles contained in broth made from beef or chicken. Bibim naengmyeon is served with a spicydressing made mainly from gochujang (red chili paste).

Mathieu de Costa

Mathieu de Costa was the first known African to come to Canada, in the early 17th century. He was a storekeeper and translator. He spoke many languages including Portuguese, French, Dutch, English, pidgin Basque, his original African language, and Míkmaq. He helped to make a connection between the Europeans and the Míkmaq people. He was a freeman. Europeans liked that he talked many languages. The Port Royal Habitation National Historic Site of Canada remembers his work. They are in Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia.

Tadao Ando

Tadao Ando is a Japanese architect. He was born in Osaka in 1941. Before he designed buildings, he had many other important experiences in his life. He became a professional boxer as a teenager and spent time in Thailand fighting. He then traveled around the world to learn about buildings. Ando became successful in the 1970s and has built buildings all over the world.

In 1995, Ando won the Pritzker Prize in 1995.


X rating

In the original Motion Picture Association of America film rating system, X rating represented that no one under 18 should be allowed to enter. Unlike the others, this rating was not copyrighted, and the rating became tied to pornography. Many theaters chose not to take an X rated movie, and many newspapers would not run ads for them. Certain movie companies had to release their films without rating, in particular independent movies. In Autumn 1990 the X was replaced with NC-17, but over the years, NC-17 absorbed the same stigma that the earlier X rating had.

Sinhala script

Sinhala script (Sinhala: සිංහල අක්ෂර මාලාව; "Siṁhala Akṣara Mālāva") is an Abugida, a script between a syllabic and alphabetic script. It is also known as Sinhalese script. It is written from left to right. It is used to write Sinhala, which is the official language of Sri Lanka. It is also used to write Sanskrit and Pali. These languages are used for religious texts. The Sinhalese Akṣara Mālāva, one of the Brahmic scripts, comes from the Ancient Indian Brahmi script. It is also related to the ancient Kannada script. 

Sinhala script comes from Brahmi, and was imported from Northern India, around the 3rd century BCE. Sinhala script developed in a complex way: Part independently but also strongly influenced by South Indian scripts at various stages. It is clearly influenced by the early Grantha script. Pottery from the 6th century BCE has been found in Anuradhapura, with lithic inscriptions dating from 2nd century BCE written in Prakrit.

Medieval Sinhalese first began to be used around 750 AD. It has a very strong influence from the Grantha script. As a result, Medieval (and modern) Sinhalese look similar to the South Indian scripts. By the 9th century CE, literature written in Sinhala script appeared and the script began to be used in other texts. As an example, the Buddhist literature of the Theravada-Buddhists of Sri Lanka, written in Pali, used Sinhala script.

Modern Sinhalese first appeared in the 13th century and is marked by the writing of the grammar book "Sidat Sangara". In 1736, the Dutch were the first to print with Sinhala type on the island. The resulting type followed the features of the native Sinhala script that was written on palm leaves. The Dutch created type that was the same width throughout the letters (monolinear) with no separation between words in early documents. During the Colonial period, a new style of Sinhala also began to used which was high contrast and had different thicknesses. This high contrast type slowly replaced the monolinear type as the preferred style.

Today, the alphabet is used by over 16 million people to write Sinhala in very different situations, such as newspapers, TV commercials, government announcements, graffiti, and schoolbooks.

Sinhala is the main language written in this script, but rare instances of Sri Lanka Malay are recorded.

This alphabet was invented in the Dambadeniya period (1220–1345). This is the first specific Sinhala alphabet to be found in writing. 
This alphabet includes the letters usually used everyday. It is enough to write almost every word in Sinhala. 
The Śuddha set was not enough to spell Pali and Sanskrit words correctly. So, new letters had to be used. This alphabet first appears in Abraham Mendis Gunasekara's Comprehensive Grammar of the Sinhalese Language, a grammar book published in 1891. 
The alphabet was adopted by the National Institute of Education in 1989. This is the alphabet commonly used in schools in Sri Lanka.
This alphabet was first published in 1990 by J.B. Dissanayake. Here, the vowels අ and ආ have two forms as open and closed. 

It uses consonants as its base unit. To make different sounds, small strokes of lines called 'pili' (in Sinhala) are written before, after, above or below the base consonant. 

ක = 'ka' sound "(this is the base consonant)"

ක + ි = කි = 'ki' sound "(a small arch like shape is placed on top of ක)"

ක + ් = ක් = 'k' sound "(a small flag like shape is placed on top of ක)"

ක + ෙ = කෙ = 'ke' sound "(a swirl is placed in front of ක)"

Here, the letters of the National Institute of Education Alphabet are shown. 

There are 18 vowels. 

There are 42 consonants. The consonants are divided into many groups based on how they are pronounced.

The consonant ඥ (pronounced like ඤ - like the "ny" in "canyon") is used today but it is not included in the National Institute of Education Alphabet.

Abugida

An abugida is a writing system that is neither a syllabic nor alphabetic script, but somewhere in between. It has sequences of consonants and vowels that are written together as a unit, each of which is based on the consonant letter. Vowels must be written down as well, but they are secondary and do not act the same way as consonants.

Syllables are built up of consonants, each of which has an inherent vowel. That means a vowel must be pronounced in a syllable even if it is not written down. For example, in Thai, the syllable written as the consonant-vowel pair หา is pronounced "haa", but the syllable just written as a consonant ห is pronounced "hɔ."

Diacritic symbols may be used to change or mute the inherent vowel, and separate vowel letters may be used when vowels occur at the beginning of a syllable or on their own.

In some abugidas, certain vowels can be written to the right, to the left, on top, or below the consonant that is spoken before it, even if the reading order all of the consonants is left-to-right or right-to-left. An example uses the Thai consonant ก to show where the following vowels must be written.

This is different from a truly alphabetic script in which the vowels and consonants have the same status, and an abjad, whose vowels can be left out. Ethiopic, most scripts of the Indian subcontinent, mainland Southeast Asia, some scripts of Maritime Southeast Asia, and Canadian syllabics are abugidas.

The oldest known abugida is the Brahmi script, a writing system that was invented in modern-day India. Most abugidas that exist today, including Devanagari, Khmer, and Thai, were based on the Brahmi script. Abugidas based on Brahmi spread along with the Indian religions throughout the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, especially Buddhism and Hinduism.

Some forms of shorthand also employ diacritics to indicate vowels.

The name 'abugida' is derived from the first four letters of the Ge'ez (Ethiopic) alphasyllabary writing system.

Some abugidas allow for consonant strings to be written down in a single consonant space. For example, in Khmer script, unlike in Thai script, consonants can be written on top of each other, with most consonants having normal and subscript forms. For example, the Khmer word "phnom" ភ្នំ as in Phnom Penh is written in one consonant space with three consonants, with ភ being "ph", ្ន being the subscript form of ន "n", and ំbeing the final "-m" to be pronounced after the vowel"." Even though the word is written as "phnm", the vowel "o" is the inherent vowel, thus it should be pronounced "phnom". An example of a word with stacked consonants and a vowel is "sri" ស្រី, in which ស is "s", ្រ is the subscript form of រ "r", and ី being the vowel "i".

Tyrrell Racing

The Tyrrell Racing Organisation was an auto racing team and Formula One constructor (race car maker). It was created by Ken Tyrrell. The team started racing in 1958 and started building its own cars in 1970. The team had its best success in the early 1970s. During that time, it won three drivers' championships and one constructors' championship with Jackie Stewart. The team never did as well again, but it kept winning races through the 1970s and into the early 1980s. It won its final win at Detroit in 1983. The team was bought by British American Tobacco in 1997. It finished its last season as Tyrrell in 1998.

Tyrrell Racing was created in 1958. It used Formula Three cars for Ken Tyrrell and local stars. Tyrrell stopped being a driver in 1959. He did not think that he was good enough as a driver. He began to run a Formula Junior operation. He used the woodshed owned by his family business, Tyrrell Brothers, to do the work on the cars. During the 1960s, Tyrrell moved through the lower levels of formula racing. John Surtees and Jacky Ickx raced for their first times with his team. The team's most famous partnership was with Jackie Stewart. Stewart first signed up in 1963. 

Tyrrell ran the BRM Formula 2 operation during 1965, 1966 and 1967. During this time, Stewart was signed to the Formula One team. Tyrrell then signed a deal to run Formula 2 cars made by French company Matra.

With the help of Elf and Ford, Tyrrell moved to Formula One in 1968. He started as a part of Matra International. It was made up of Tyrrell's own team and the French auto maker Matra. Stewart was expected to race very well. He won several Grands Prix in the teams Matra MS10. The car's most unusual feature was the use of aviation-styled structural fuel tanks. These let the car to be around 15 kg lighter. Although it was lighter, it was still stronger than the cars it was racing against. The FIA thought that the technology was not safe. They chose to not let it be used in 1970. They said that rubber bag-tanks had to be used instead.

For the 1969 championship, the Matra team chose to not compete in Formula One. Instead of competing, Matra worked with Ken Tyrrell's 'Matra International' team. They built a new DFV powered car with structural fuel tanks, even though it would only be able to be used for a single season. Stewart won the 1969 title easily driving the new Cosworth-powered Matra MS80. Stewart's title was the first won by a French chassis. It was the only one won by a chassis built in France. It was a very special event for a team and a constructor that had only entered Formula One the year before.

IN 1970, Matra merged with Simca. For the 1970 season, Tyrrell was asked by Matra to use Simca's V12 in place of the Cosworth. Simca was a subsidiary of the American company Chrysler which was competition for Ford. Stewart tested the Matra V12. He did not think it was as good as the DFV. Ford gave Tyrrell a large part of the money they needed to race. The team also got money for the French petroleum company Elf. Elf had an agreement with Renault that did not allow them to provide money to anyone who was partnered with Simca. Because of this, Ken Tyrrell had to buy a March 701 chassis as temporary solution while making his own car in secret.

Tyrrell was still sponsored by French fuel company Elf, and Tyrrell would keep the traditional French blue racing colours for most of the rest of the time the company existed. Tyrrell and Stewart ran the March-Fords throughout 1970 with mixed success. During this time, Derek Gardner worked on the first Tyrrell built Grand Prix car at the woodshed in Ockham, Surrey.

The Tyrrell 001, which looked like the MS80, was first seen in . It earned Stewart a pole position in the Canadian GP. The car had problems in all of its 3 race starts. The nearly identical Tyrrell 003 won both Drivers' and Constructors' Championships in . Stewart's had health problems dealing with a stomach ulcer in 1972 and did not race. He was well in 1973 and raced again. He finishing 1st in the Championship. On October 6, 1973, Tyrrell's other driver was killed in practice for the US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen. Stewart, who was to stop racing at the end of the season, and Tyrrell decided they did not want to keep racing. Without their best driver, Tyrrell were never serious World Championship contenders again.

The team did still win some races during the 1970s with Jody Scheckter and Patrick Depailler. Most notable of these was Scheckter's win at the 1976 Swedish Grand Prix. They finished first and second in that race using an unusual Derek Gardner designed Tyrrell P34 car. The P34 was the first (and only) successful six-wheeled F1 car. They replaced front wheels with smaller wheels mounted in banks of two on either side of the car. The design was no longer used after Goodyear refused to make the small tires needed for the car.

In 1977, the Turbo era started in Grand Prix racing. By the mid-1980s, normal (non-turbo) cars could not race as well. Without the enough money, Tyrrell was the last team with the Cosworth DFV. All other teams had changed to turbocharged engines. It was the start of two decades of bad times for Tyrrell. The last win for the classic Cosworth Ford DFV engine was by a Tyrrell car, Michele Alboreto at the 1983 Detroit Grand Prix. It was also Tyrrell's last Grand Prix win.

Tyrrell had money problems in the 1980s and 1990s. In the late 1990s, Tyrrell had problems with his health as well. In 1998 and in the face of dwindling form and ill health, he sold his team to British American Tobacco. The team became British American Racing. The last race for Tyrrell was the 1998 Japanese Grand Prix, where Ricardo Rosset failed to qualify and team-mate Toranosuke Takagi ended the race on lap 28 after a collision with Esteban Tuero's Minardi.

Copenhagen Metro

The Copenhagen Metro (Danish: Københavns metro) is the longest underground traffic system in Denmark. It is a 20.5 km (12.7 mi) metro system. It was opened between 2002 and 2007, and has two lines, M1 (green) 14.3 km (8.9 mi) and M2 (yellow) 14.2 km, (8.8 mi). M3 and M4 will be made in the future. In 2009, the metro carried 50 million passengers.

Weston, Illinois (DuPage County)

Weston, Illinois was a community next to Batavia. It was a subdivision of pre-fabricated homes started in the early 1960s. Sales were very slow, so the land developers tried to attract Fermilab to be a new employer on the edge of the new town. However, it turned out that the amount of land needed would swallow up the entire town. So, the town voted to sell all of the land, including the houses that had been built to Fermilab. The people wanted to move the town to the east beyond the edge of Fermilab, but county officials prohibited the move. The town then dissolved.

Before new Fermilab buildings could be finished, the scientists moved into the Weston houses and also moved all of the farm houses on Fermilab to that location for use as office space. They renamed Weston, "Fermilab Village." It still houses visiting scientists.


Kim Ok-gyun

Kim Ok-gyun (Korean: 김옥균; 1851 – 1894) was Korean Joseon Dynasty politician and diplomat. His nicknames were Gowoo (Korean: 고우, 古遇) and Gokyun (Korean: 고균, 古筠).



Great Britain at the Olympics

Great Britain at the Olympics is a history which includes 50 games in 23 countries and 6,000+ athletes. Since 1896, sportsmen of the United Kingdom have taken part the growth of the "Olympic Movement".
The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for Great Britain is GBR.

The British National Olympic Committee was formed in 1905. It was recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1905.

Great Britain's team first competed at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Berlin.

Great Britain is the name that the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland uses when it competes at the Olympic Games. Great Britain was one of 14 teams to compete in the first Games in 1896. It has competed at every Games. As of 2012, Athletes from Great Britain have won 780 medals at the Summer Olympic Games. They have won 22 at the Winter Olympic Games. Great Britain is the only team to have won at least one gold medal at every Summer Games.

Great Britain was the name given to the United Kingdom team for the 1908 Summer Olympics. It was also given the IOC country code "GBR". The team is also called "Team GB". Representatives of the devolved Northern Ireland government, do not think this is a good name. They think it suggests that Northern Ireland is not part of the British Olympic team, and they think the name should be changed to Team UK. However, British is a correct term for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as, for instance, in "the British Government".
In an agreement between the British and Irish Olympic groups, athletes from Northern Ireland can choose to be a part of the Irish Olympic team. All British people may have dual citizenship if they wish.

London, the United Kingdom's capital, has hosted the Games on three occasions.
In 2012, London became the first city to host the Olympics three times.



Sundance Sea

The Sundance Sea was an inland or epeiric sea covering much of western North America in the Jurassic period. It was an arm of what is now the Arctic Ocean, and extended through what is now western Canada into the central western United States. The sea receded (moved back) when highlands to the west began to rise.

The Sundance Sea did not occur at a single time; evidence suggests that it was a series of five successive marine transgressions. Each was separated by a period of erosion.The sea advanced and receded from the Middle Jurassic onwards. The terrestrial sediments of the Morrison Formation eroded from rising highlands to the west were deposited on top of the calcareous Sundance Formation as the sea retreated for the last time, late in the Jurassic.

The sedimentary rocks which formed in and around the Sundance Sea are often rich in fossils.

The Sundance Sea had many types of animals. The oyster "Gryphaea" was very common, and shark teeth have been found. Fish, belemnites and to an extent ammonites swarmed in shoals. Crinoids and bivalvia dotted the seafloor. "Ophthalmosaurus", a large ichthyosaur, swam in the seas using its large, long jaws to catch belemnite 'squid'. "Pantosaurus", a plesiosaur the size of a seal, went after the easier-to-catch fish. The largest marine reptile in the Sundance Sea was "Megalneusaurus", a large pliosaur similar to "Liopleurodon". Its fossils have been found in Alaska and Wyoming, which were both covered by the Sundance Sea when it was alive.

During the periods of recession, dinosaurs and other Jurassic animals walked on the shores, leaving fossil footprints.


Western Interior Seaway

The Western Interior Seaway was a huge inland sea. It split North America into two halves for most of the mid- and late-Cretaceous Period. It was up to deep, wide and over long.

Sea level was high in the Cretaceous, and the middle part of North America sank down. A shallow subducting plate pulled on the bottom of the lithosphere, causing it to move down. The sea entered both north and south, and came and went during the course of the Cretaceous. Widespread carbonate deposition suggests that the Seaway was warm and tropical, with abundant calcareous algae. The shrunken, regressive phase of the Western Interior Seaway is sometimes called the Pierre Seaway.

The long, narrow western border of the seaway called Laramidia had one of the most diverse collections of dinosaurs anywhere on Earth.

The Western Interior Seaway was a shallow sea filled with abundant marine life. This included predatory marine reptiles such as plesiosaurs, and mosasaurs that grew up to 18 meters long. Other marine life included sharks such as "Squalicorax" and the giant shellfish-eating "Ptychodus mortoni" (believed to be 10 meters long). There were advanced bony fish such as the massive 5-meter long "Xiphactinus" – a fish larger than any modern bony fish. Other sea life included invertebrates such as molluscs, ammonites, squid-like belemnites, and plankton including coccolithophores that secreted the chalky platelets that give the Cretaceous its name, foraminiferans and radiolarians.

The Western Interior Seaway was home to early birds also, including the flightless "Hesperornis" which had stout legs for swimming through water and small wing-like appendages used for marine steering rather than flight; and the tern-like "Ichthyornis", an early avian with a toothy beak. "Icthyornis" shared the sky with large pterosaurs such as "Nyctosaurus" and "Pteranodon". "Pteranodon" fossils are very common and it was likely a major component of the surface ecosystem, though it was only found in the southern reaches of the Seaway.

On the bottom, the giant clam "Inoceramus" left common fossilized shells in the Pierre Shale. This clam had a thick shell paved with prisms of calcite deposited at right angles to the surface, giving a pearly luster in life. Paleontologists suggest that its giant size was an adaptation for life in the murky bottom waters, where a correspondingly large gill area would have allowed the animal to cope with oxygen-depleted waters.


Common poorwill

The Common Poorwill ("Phalaenoptilus nuttallii") is a nocturnal bird of the family Caprimulgidae, the nightjars. It is found from British Columbia and southeastern Alberta, through the western United States to northern Mexico. The bird's habitat is dry, open areas with grasses or shrubs, and even stony desert slopes with very little vegetation.

Hooded pitohui

The hooded pitohui ("Pitohui dichrous"), is a songbird of New Guinea with black and orange plumage.

This species and its two close relatives, the variable pitohui and the brown pitohui, were the first known poisonous birds. A neurotoxin found in the birds' skin and feathers causes numbness and tingling in those touching the bird.

The hooded pitohui gets its poison from part of its diet, the "Choresine" beetles of the Melyridae family. These beetles are also a likely source of the lethal batrachotoxins found in Colombia's poison dart frogs.

Common and widespread throughout New Guinea, the hooded pitohui is of 'Least Concern' on the IUCN Red List of threatened species.

2014 Atlantic hurricane season

The 2014 Atlantic hurricane season was a below-average season in terms of named storms, and an average season in terms of both hurricanes and major hurricanes. It produced nine tropical cyclones, eight named storms, the fewest since the 1997 Atlantic hurricane season, six hurricanes and two major hurricanes. It officially began on June 1, 2014, and ended on November 30, 2014. These dates historically describe the period each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The first storm of the season, Arthur, developed on July 1, while the final storm, Hanna, dissipated on October 28, about a month prior to the end of the season
This is the list of names used for named storms that form in the North Atlantic in 2014. The list is the same as the 2008 list except for Gonzalo, Isaias, and Paulette because Gustav, Ike, and Paloma were damaging and deadly storms in 2008, and their names were retired. In 2014 no storms were retired so the same exact list was used in 2020.

Tenpō

The "nengō" "Tenpō" means "Heavenly Protection".




Direct proof

A direct proof is a way of showing that something is true or false by using logic. This is done by combining known facts. No assumptions are made when doing a direct proof. Lemmas and theorems are used to prove direct proofs.

A statement that can be proved with a direct proof is usually in the form "if "p", then "q"." Here, "p" and "q" are facts. To solve a statement like this, every case where "p" is true must be considered.

For example, this statement can be solved with a direct proof: "if x and y are even integers, then x+y is an even integer." Since x and y are even, then we can say that "x=2m" and "y=2n," where "m" and "n" are integers. (This is a lemma.) We can also say that "m+n" is an integer, because adding two integers gives an integer. (This is another lemma.) Then we can say that "x+y=2m+2n=2(m+n)". Since "m+n" is an integer, we can say "2(m+n)=2k", where "k=m+n". We know that any integer times 2 is an even integer. We can then say that any two even integers added together give an even integer.

Direct proofs are used in mathematics, logic, and computer science. The opposite of a direct proof is an indirect proof (also called a "proof by contradiction".)


Death Valley Junction

Death Valley Junction (formerly, Amargosa and '"Death Valley'") is a tiny Mojave Desert community in unincorporated Inyo County, California, at the intersection of SR 190 and SR 127, just east of Death Valley National Park. The zip code is 92328, the elevation is , and the population fewer than 20. It contains the Amargosa Opera House and Hotel.

Criticism of Christianity

Since its beginning, Christianity has been criticized by people in all professions and by people of all other religions. The reason for the criticism varies: many Christians have followed the Bible in criticising homosexuality, abortion and many other hot button issues. Also, Christianity may be rejected because of lack of interest (due to abuse of Christianity) or some just prefer to not convert into it.

Beginning with the Enlightenment, in the 18th century, people began to apply methods of text criticism they had also applied to other documents, and philosophical writings. This form of criticism uses reason, rather than revelations to study texts. There are four primary types of Biblical criticism: form, traditional, higher and lower criticism.

Conservative Christians, as well as much of Orthodox Judaism and Karaite Judaism, support the idea that the Bible is historically accurate. Moderate and liberal Christians generally think the Bible texts are historical, and reliable. They do however think that certain passages should not be read literally, but metaphorically.

Kōka






During the Koka era, Hiroshige began making prints of women in the context of famous places.



Hoxne treasure

The Hoxne treasure is the largest find of late Roman silver and gold in Britain, and the largest collection of gold and silver coins of the fourth and fifth century found anywhere in the Roman Empire.

The treasure was found by metal detector in the village of Hoxne in Suffolk, England, on 1992. The hoard consists of 14,865 Roman gold, silver and bronze coins from the late fourth and early fifth centuries, and about 200 items of silver tableware and gold jewellery.

The objects are now in the British Museum in London, where the most important pieces and a selection of the rest are on permanent display. In 1993, the Treasure Valuation Committee valued the hoard at £1.75 million (today £).

The hoard was buried as an oak box or small chest filled with items in precious metal, with some in smaller wooden boxes and others in bags or wrapped in fabric. Remnants of the chest, and of fittings such as hinges and locks, were recovered in the dig. The coins date the hoard to after AD 407, about the end of Britain as a Roman province.

The owners and reasons for burial of the hoard are unknown, but it was carefully packed and the contents seem what a very rich family might have owned. The lack of large silver serving vessels and of some of the most common types of jewellery, suggest that the hoard is only part of the wealth of its owner.

The Hoxne treasure contains several rare and important objects, including a gold body-chain and silver-gilt pepper-pots. The hoard was excavated by archaeologists with the items largely undisturbed and intact. The find has helped to improve the relationship between people using metal detectors and archaeologists. It has influenced a change in English law on finds of treasure.


Tōhoku region

The is one of Japan's traditional regions. The Japanese conventions of geography and history divide the nation into eight regions, including the Tōhoku region. These have been used since 1905 as basic units for description and comparison and as cultural markers.

The regions of Japan are a fusion of historical divisions and modern administrative needs. The significance of the region in Japan is geographical, cultural and administrative.

In the late 7th century, the "Tōsandō" region were identified as one of the eight largest administrative areas of the Imperial system ("ritsuryo seido").

"Gokishichidō" is an ancient system of names for parts of the country, including "Tōsandō". "Tōhoku" covers the northern area of the island of Honshū in roughly the same area as the traditional "Tōsandō".

In the Meiji period, the modern regional system was made by Imperial decree. Japan was divided into regions ("chihō "), including the Tōhoku region. A regional council ("chihō gyōsei kyōgisai") was headed by the governor of the most powerful prefecture in the regional grouping. The council also included regional chiefs of central government ministries.

Over time, Tōhoku has developed its own regional dialects, customs and unique traditional culture. Tōhoku is famous for farming. Now a lot of kinds of vegetable are grown.

The Tōhoku University was built in 1907.

In 2011, Tōhoku was struck with a very strong earthquake and tsunami. It caused a lot of damage. Now, people in Japan do their best for the complete revival of Tōhoku.

The region occupies the northeastern part of Honshu, which is the largest Japanese island. 

The region has six prefectures. From north to south, they are:



Sri Lanka Railways S11

Sri Lanka Railways Class S11 is a diesel multiple-unit (DMU) train, built for Sri Lanka Railways by RITES Ltd, an Indian state infrastructure corporation. The DMUs are currently being imported in phases, with the last batch arriving in Sri Lanka in March 2012. They were built to replace locomotive-hauled passenger trains. Twenty S11 DMUs were ordered to strengthen long distance travel on the Coastal railway line from Colombo to Matara.

Communes of the Guadeloupe department

The following is a list of the 32 communes of the Guadeloupe overseas department of France.

Former communes detached from Guadeloupe on February 22, 2007:

List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people: A

This is a partial list of famous people who are confirmed to be gay, lesbian or bisexual. Famous people who are rumored to be gay, lesbian or bisexual, are not listed. The definition of sexual orientation varies and has changed over time; for example the word "gay" was not used to describe a person's sexual orientation until the mid 20th century. However, there has been a number of different words or slangs that have been used to describe sexual orientations since the mid-19th century. Several studies have found that much of the research about sexual orientation has failed to define the term at all, which made it difficult to find results of different studies. 

The high numbers of people from the West on this list may be due to societies attitudes toward homosexuality. The Pew Research Center's 2003 Global Attitudes Survey found that "[p]eople in Africa and the Middle East strongly object to societal acceptance of homosexuality. But there is far greater tolerance for homosexuality in major Latin American countries such as Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil. Opinion in Europe is split between West and East. Majorities in every Western European nation surveyed say homosexuality should be accepted by society, while most Russians, Poles and Ukrainians disagree. Americans are divided; a narrow majority (51 percent) believe homosexuality should be accepted, while 42 percent disagree."

Germany at the Olympics

German athletes have been a part of most of the Olympic Games since the first modern Games in 1896.

The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for Germany is GER.

Germany has hosted three Olympic Games. They hosted both the Winter and Summer Games in 1936. They also hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics. Germany was also to be the host of the 1916 Summer Olympics and the 1940 Winter Olympics. Neither of these were held because of World War I and World War II. After these wars, Germans were not allowed to be a part of the Olympics in 1920, 1924 and 1948. From after World War II until 1990, the country was divided and took part in the Olympics separately. Each of the two German states boycotted the Summer Games. West Germany was one of 65 countries that did not go to Moscow in 1980. This boycott was because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In 1984 East Germany joined the Soviet boycott of the Summer Games in Los Angeles.

German athletes have won 1618 medals. . They have won 528 gold, 542 silver and 548 bronze medals.

German organisations were ended by the Allies in 194. In 1950 the IOC accepted the Nationales Olympisches Komitee für Deutschland for all of Germany. It was in (West) Germany.

Due to the Cold War, the (German Democratic Republic) was created in October 1949. A National Olympic Committee (NOC) for East Germany was created in 1951. It was not accepted by the IOC at first. Until 1965, athletes of the NOC of East Germany had to join the German team represented by the NOC of (West) Germany. This team took part in the Olympics from 1956 to 1964. It is now called the United Team of Germany ("EUA", "Equipe Unifiée Allemande"), but was Germany ("GER") then. Because of Germany being divided, from 1968 to 1990 two teams took part in each of the Games. Their designations were "GER" for the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and "GDR" for the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In 1980 the West German code was changed to "FRG". After the East Germany became a part of Germany again in 1990, Germany had a single team. It was designated "GER".

In the early 1950s the French-controlled Saar had its own NOC. It took part in the 1952 Summer Olympics. It became a part of the German Olympic team in 1956.



Line Islands

The Line Islands are an island chain in the central Pacific Ocean near the equator. Three of the islands are territories of the United States of America. These islands are Jarvis Island, Kingman Reef, and Palmyra Island. The rest of the islands are part of Kiribati, an island nation in the Pacific ocean. The Islands that are part of Kiribati are Washington Island, Tabuaeran, Kiritimati, Malden Island, Starbuck Island, Caroline Island, Flint Island, and Vostok Island. The islands are sometimes grouped into the southern line islands (Caroline, Vostok, and Flint islands), central line islands (Jarvis Island, Malden Island, and Starbuck islands), and northern line islands (Kingman Reef, Kiritimati, and Palmyra, Washington, and Fanning islands).

Kaei

The "nengō" "Kaei" means "Celebration of Eternity" or "Eternal Felicity"





During the "Kaei" era, the shogunate bought guns and encouraged the manufacture of guns.



Fenius Farsaid

Fenius Farsaid was a King in Irish mythology. He was King of Scythia when the Tower of Babel was being built, and one of 72 chieftains working for King Nimrod to build it. He managed to keep his language alive even after Babel confused languages and this eventually became Irish according to the myth. His son Nel married Scota, the daughter of King Cingris of Egypt. From his son the Gaels supposedly descended. He is mentioned in "Lebor Gabala Erenn" and "Auraicept na en-Eces".

Weston, Illinois (McLean County)

Weston, Illinois is an unincorporated community in McLean County, Illinois. It is on U.S. Route 24.

On 26 August 1867, W. F. Bryan laid out Weston. The Original Town included 288 small lots, five blocks that were not subdivided and a Public Park. The depot and town hall were on the south side of the tracks. The station was for the Toledo Peoria and Western Railroad. In 1895 there were four churches. Just east of town, Western Cemetery has an area of natural tall grass prairie.

Ansei

The "nengō" "Ansei" means "tranquil government".













 

Man'en

The "nengō" "Tenpō" means "Ten Thousand Years Prolonged"





Euro disco

Euro disco is a form of disco-based dance music which originated in the late-1970s in Europe, as a more European variant of disco music. Euro disco was based on disco music, yet it was a more encompassing genre which borrowed influences from pop, rock and New Wave music. In such a way, it was more pop-friendly and less "gritty" than regular disco music. It often included synthesizers within its composition.

Euro disco, as the term suggests, was popular in Europe. Nevertheless, it also achieved popularity in the United States through artists such as Donna Summer. Some regard Kraftwerk as the first Euro disco group. Furthermore, Giorgio Moroder was also a major force within the Euro disco scene.

Wilson's bird-of-paradise

The Wilson's bird-of-paradise is a small bird of the Paradisaeidae family.

The male is a red and black bird-of-paradise with a yellow mantle on its neck, a light-green mouth, blue feet and two curved violet tail feathers. The head is naked blue with a black double cross pattern on it. 

As so often with birds in general, and paradise birds in particular, the female is not showy. It is a brownish bird, though it does have a bare blue crown.

Wilson's bird-of-paradise eat usually fruit or small insects.

Woodpecker finch

The Woodpecker Finch is a species of birds in the family Fringillidae. They live in the Galapagos Islands and are named for their habit of eating grubs that live in the woods. But the woodpecker finch, unlike woodpeckers, does not have a long tongue or a bill that is suitable for getting hold of the grubs. Instead, it uses a cactus spine or twig that is the right shape to dig grubs out. 

Secretarybird

The secretarybird ("Sagittarius serpentarius") is a large terrestrial bird of prey. It is usually found in African savannas and open grasslands.

Unlike most birds of prey, the secretarybird hunts its prey on foot. Adults hunt in pairs and sometimes as family flocks. They stalk through the grass with long strides. Prey includes insects, mammals from mice to hares and mongoose, crabs, lizards, snakes, tortoises, young birds, bird eggs, and sometimes dead animals killed in grass or bushfires.

The bird is famous for hunting snakes. It even hunts venomous cobras and other reptiles. Its claws are weak and blunt, so to make a kill, it stomps on its victim, breaking its back.

It is put in its own family on the basis of molecular sequence analysis.

Standing up, the secretarybird is nearly 4.5 feet (1.3 m) tall.

Nucleophile

A nucleophile is a Chemical species that donates an electron-pair to an electrophile to form a chemical bond in a reaction. All molecules or ions with a free pair of electrons can be nucleophiles. This pair of electrons is called lone pair. Because nucleophiles donate electrons, they fit the definition of Lewis bases. 

Nucleophilic describes the attraction of a nucleophile to the nuclei. Nucleophilicity, sometimes referred to as nucleophile strength, refers to a substance's nucleophilic character and is often used to compare the attraction of atoms.

Neutral nucleophilic reactions with solvents such as alcohols and water are called "solvolysis". Nucleophiles may take part in nucleophilic substitution reactions. In those reactions, a nucleophile becomes attracted to a full or partial positive charge.

The terms "nucleophile" and "electrophile" were introduced by Christopher Kelk Ingold in 1929, replacing the terms "cationoid" and "anionoid" proposed earlier by A. J. Lapworth in 1925.

The word nucleophile is derived from nucleus and the Greek word φιλος, philos for love.

In general, within a row across the periodic table, the more basic the ion (the higher the pK of the conjugate acid) the more reactive it is as a nucleophile. In a given group, polarizability is more important in the determination of the nucleophilicity. In other words, the easier it is to distort the electron cloud around an atom or molecule, the more readily it will react. For example, the iodide ion (I) is more nucleophilic than the fluoride ion (F).

Examples of nucleophiles are anions such as Cl, or a compound with a lone pair of electrons such as NH (ammonia).

In the example below, the oxygen of the hydroxide ion donates an electron pair to bond with the carbon at the end of the bromopropane molecule. The bond between the carbon and the bromine then undergoes heterolytic fission, with the bromine atom taking the donated electron and becoming the bromide ion (Br). This is a S2 reaction occurs by backside attack. This means that the hydroxide ion attacks the carbon atom from the other side, exactly opposite the bromine ion. Because of this backside attack, S2 reactions result in a reversal of the configuration of the electrophile. If the electrophile is chiral, it typically keeps its chirality, though the S2 product's configuration is flipped as compared to that of the original electrophile (Walden inversion). 

An ambident nucleophile is one that can attack from two or more places, resulting in two or more products. For example, the thiocyanate ion (SCN) may attack from either the S or the N. For this reason, the S2 reaction of an alkyl halide with SCN often leads to a mixture of RSCN (an alkyl thiocyanate) and RNCS (an alkyl isothiocyanate). Similar mixtures will happen in the Kolbe nitrile synthesis.

Alkyl metal halides are carbon nucleophiles found in the Grignard reaction, Blaise reaction, Reformatsky reaction, and Barbier reaction, organolithium reagents, and anions of a terminal alkyne.

Enols are also carbon nucleophiles. The formation of an enol is catalyzed by acid or base. Enols are ambident nucleophiles, but, in general, nucleophilic at the carbon atom next to the carbons with double bond (alpha carbon atom). Enols are commonly used in condensation reactions, including the Claisen condensation and the aldol condensation reactions.

Examples of oxygen nucleophiles are water (HO), hydroxide anion, alcohols, alkoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, and carboxylate anions.

Of sulfur nucleophiles, hydrogen sulfide and its salts, thiols (RSH), thiolate anions (RS), anions of thiolcarboxylic acids (RC(O)-S), and anions of dithiocarbonates (RO-C(S)-S) and dithiocarbamates (RN-C(S)-S) are used most often.

In general, sulfur is very nucleophilic because of its large size, which makes it readily polarizable, and its lone pairs of electrons are readily accessible.

Nitrogen nucleophiles include ammonia, azide, amines, and nitrites.


Taishō period

The , also known as the Taishō era, was a after "Meiji" and before "Shōwa." This period started on July 30, 1912 and it ended on December 25, 1926. During this time, the emperor was .

The "nengō" "Taishō" means "Great Justice" or "Great Righteousness".

The years in which Taishō was the Japanese monarch comprise this period or era.




Lanarkshire derby

The Lanarkshire Derby is a football rivalry in Lanarkshire, Scotland, and matches are played between two of Motherwell, Hamilton Academical, Airdrie United and Albion Rovers.

This game is the biggest Lanarkshire derby, and big crowds usually come to watch this match, at either Fir Park or Excelsior Stadium. For a very long time, Motherwell and Airdrieonians were the two biggest teams in Lanarkshire, up until Airdrie went out of business in 2002. There has only been one game between these two teams since Airdrie re-formed as Airdrie United, in the 2007 Scottish Cup. A Richie Foran goal won it for Motherwell that day, in front of a crowd of 5,924, the highest ever for an Airdrie United match. Also, this match had often been the final of the Lanarkshire Cup, a competition where teams from all-over Lanarkshire played in. This competition stopped in 1996.

This game is the second-biggest Lanarkshire derby, and the most Southern of all the derbies. Up until 2008, both teams were mostly in different divisions. Then Hamilton got promoted to the SPL and both teams were to play each other a lot. This ended when Hamilton got relegated in 2011, meaning that Motherwell are now the only SPL team in Lanarkshire.

This game is between the two middle-rated teams in Lanarkshire, and is not as big as when one of the teams play Motherwell. Both teams have usually been in a league lower than the SPL, so this is not thought to be a big derby.

This game is big for both teams, as they were both in the Monklands area, until Airdrie moved to a new stadium in the Petersburn area in 1998. The first match between Albion and Airdrie (as United), was in 2010, when Airdrie beat Albion Rovers 1-0 at Cliftonhill. Since that game, both teams are in the same division in the 2011-12 season.

This is not a big derby match, as both teams have been in different divisions for most of their existence. They were in the same league in 2001, but have not met each other since, making this derby the smallest. Coatbridge and Hamilton are 6 miles apart.

This is the least remembered of the derbies, as Albion have been in the lower divisions for most of their existence, whilst Motherwell have been in the top division. There is also no bad feeling between the two, as a few young Motherwell players have gone out on loan to Albion Rovers over the years.

Camposaurus

Camposaurus is a dinosaur from the Late Triassic of North America. It is a relative of "Coelophysis". This relationship was upheld by a recent phylogenetic anlysis.

With fossils dating back to 205–210 million years ago (mya), it is the oldest known neotheropod. It is known from partial lower leg bones and other fragmentary material. 

A study of "Camposaurus arizoniensis" by Ezcurra and Brusatte discovered two unique features. This meant the specimen was a valid genus and species. "Camposaurus" is definitely a neotheropod. Based on phylogenetic analysis, its closest known relative is "Megapnosaurus rhodensis", because they share similarities in the tibia, and ankle. Spielman et al. (2007) put "Camposaurus" in the family Coelophysidae.

Staurikosaurus

Staurikosaurus is a genus of Upper Triassic theropod dinosaurs found in Brazil. It was a small, lightly built carnivore.

The rarity of "Staurikosaurus" remains may be a result of it being uncommon while alive, or because it lived in an environment such as a forest, where fossils rarely form.

At just , 80 centimetres tall (31 in), and weighing just 30 kilograms (66 lb), "Staurikosaurus" was small in comparison to later theropods like "Megalosaurus". "Staurikosaurus" and the related "Herrerasaurus" are definitely theropods and evolved after the sauropod line had split from the theropods.

The fossil record of "Staurikosaurus" is poor, but the skeletal structure of the legs is known. "Staurikosaurus" was a quick runner for its size. It also had just two vertebrae joining the pelvis to the spine, a distinctly primitive arrangement.

The available teeth for Staurikosaurus strongly suggest a carnivorous diet.

The tail of "Staurikosaurus" was relatively long (with more than 40 vertebrae) compared to the rest of its body and was held straight and off the ground as it ran. The rear part of "Staurikosauruss tail is stiffened by features of the tail vertebrae. Ostrom thought this was a dynamic stabilizer to help balance while leaping and running.


Ostend manifesto

The Ostend Manifesto was an 1854 document describing the reasons for the United States to buy Cuba. Cuba was to be added as a slave state of the United States.

Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator

Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) was an early British computer. It was made by Maurice Wilkes and his team at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in England. EDSAC was the first stored-program electronic computer. It was also the first to run a computer game.

Later the project was supported by J. Lyons & Co. Ltd., a British company. They were rewarded with the first commercial computer, LEO I. LEO I was based on the EDSAC design. EDSAC ran its first programs on 6 May 1949, when it calculated a table of square numbers and a list of prime numbers.

Voting age

Voting age is the age when a person is allowed to vote in political elections by governments. 

Most countries set it at 18. Ages ranging from 16 to 21 exist. Iran is the only sovereignty to ever have a voting age below 16 in recent history. They set it at 15 until it was raised to 18 recently. 

When the voting age was first established it was usually set at 21. In the later twentieth century most countries, including the United States, lowered it to 18. A few jurisdictions today, such as Austria and the Isle of Man, have lowered it to 16. 

This topic connects up with various other age-related permissions, such as age limit on purchasing alcohol. and age of possible marriage. Use of terms such as "teenager" needs to be clear as to what the term covers.

Shrek the Halls

Shrek the Halls is a television Christmas special. It was first shown on the American television network ABC on Wednesday, November 28, 2007. The special is based on the characters from the "Shrek" movies. It is thirty minutes long. The cast includes Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and Antonio Banderas. The television special was released on iTunes on November 2, 2008. It was shown again on December 9, 2009, December 4, 2010, December 9, 2010, and November 28, 2011 on ABC.

The special is set shortly after the events of "Shrek the Third" and before the events of "Shrek Forever After". It takes place when Shrek and Fiona's children are still infants.

Shrek (Mike Myers) is quietly living in the swamp with his family when the Christmas season arrives. Donkey (Eddie Murphy) convinces Shrek to tell Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) to expect a special Christmas surprise. Shrek goes to the local bookstore in Far, Far Away to try to find a present for Fiona. Because he does not know what Christmas is all about, the shopkeeper (Marissa Jaret Winokur) gives Shrek a copy of the book "Christmas For Village Idiots". It is a step-by-step guide to celebrating the holiday.

Shrek does what the book say to do by decorating the house and getting a tree. He plans to have a quiet Christmas Eve with his family. Donkey brings the entire "family" to the swamp. This ruins Shrek's plans.

Shrek tries to tell his own version of "A Visit from St. Nicholas (The Night Before Christmas)". Gingy, Donkey, and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) interrupt and each tell their own version of a Christmas story. Donkey tells of floats coming to the swamp. At the end, Donkey tells of licking a very large Santa figure that is made out of waffles. Puss tells his version of the story of Santa Claus. He ends up playing with the with one of the baubles from the Christmas tree. Gingy's story is not happy. It is very scary. He tells about how his girlfriend Suzy got eaten by Santa Claus.

DOnkey finds Shrek's "Christmas for Village Idiots" book. In a fight over the book, all of Shrek's decorations, furniture and the tree are destroyed. Shrek gets angry and tells everyone to leave the house.

In a bad mood, Fiona and Shrek have a talk. After they talk, she takes the children and leaves the swamp to go and apologize to their friends. Shrek feels very bad that Christmas Eve did not go as he hoped it would.

Fiona finds their friends and explains to Donkey what Shrek had wanted for Christmas. Shrek joins them and tells them he is sorry for getting mad. Donkey is surprised to learn that this is Shrek's first Christmas, because "ogres don't celebrate anything." Donkey says he is sorry for being annoying. He says that Christmas never goes as planned and according to his mother, "'Christmas ain't Christmas until somebody cries', and that's usually me."

After a snowball fight, the friends return to the swamp. Shrek tells his story. It is about Ogre Claus, not Santa Claus. Soon they hear bells. They go outside to see Santa and his reindeer. Gingy runs back inside screaming in fear.


"Shrek the Halls" was produced by DreamWorks Animation at the PDI/DreamWorks studio. Gary Trousdale directed the special at first, but he was later replaced by Mark Baldo. The movie was produced by Teresa Cheng, Gina Shay and Aron Warner. The screenplay was written by Bill Riling, Theresa Cullen, Gary Trousdale and Sean Bishop.

"Shrek the Halls" was released on DVD in the United States on November 4, 2008. It was first sold by itself, or combined with "Shrek the Third".

Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas

Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas is a television Christmas special that was first shown on the American television network ABC on Thursday, November 24, 2011. It is based on characters from the movie "Ice Age". The entire cast from the movies all play the same characters; Ciara Bravo is the voice of Peaches, who is now a young kid. There are new characters voiced by Billy Gardell, T. J. Miller, and Judah Friedlander.

In the middle of decorating for the holiday season, Sid (John Leguizamo) accidentally destroys Manny's (Ray Romano) favorite decoration, the traditional Christmas rock (predating the Christmas tree) by accident. Sid, convinced by Manny that he's now on Santa's naughty list, takes off with Crash (Seann William Scott), Eddie (Josh Peck), and Peaches (Ciara Bravo) — who's still a young child — for the North Pole to get him off the naughty list. On their journey, they befriend one of Santa's reindeer Prancer (T. J. Miller).

When they arrive at the North Pole, Sid and his crew accidentally destroy Santa's (Billy Gardell) workshop. When Manny, Ellie, and Diego (worried over Peaches' safety) arrive at the North Pole, they reunite to save Christmas. With the help of an army of mini-sloths (who had attacked Sid and his crew before), the Sub-Zero Heroes make enough new toys for every child on Earth. Santa is then able to distribute presents on a worldwide basis after Prancer and his whole family volunteer to pull his sleigh. Santa has also left Scrat (Chris Wedge) a present: A small acorn, which he then loses again.


"Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas" was positively welcomed from audience.

2016 United States presidential election

The 2016 United States presidential election was the 58th presidential election that happened on November 8, 2016. Businessman Donald Trump and Indiana governor Mike Pence, defeated former secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Virginia senator Tim Kaine on the Republican Party ticket. 

Then-incumbent President Barack Obama was term limited by the Twenty-second amendment, which made him unable to serve a third presidential term. Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton won the Democratic nomination. Trump became his party's front-runner against many candidates in the Republican primary, defeating Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Marco Rubio, and Ohio Governor John Kasich among other candidates. 

Many third-party candidates ran, such as Gary Johnson. Trump chose Governor of Indiana Mike Pence as his running mate, and Clinton chose Senator Tim Kaine as her running mate. 

Trump received 304 electoral votes, 34 more votes than what was needed to win, while Clinton received 227. Even though Trump lost the popular vote, the electoral votes decide the actual winner of the election. Trump took office on January 20, 2017.

 of the United States Constitution says that for a person to be elected and serve as President of the United States, they must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, at least 35 years old, and a resident of the United States for a period of no less than 14 years.

Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the various political parties of the United States, in which case each party devises a method (such as a primary election) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf.

President Barack Obama was unable to seek re-election for a third term because of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states that a president may only serve up to two terms. His term as president ended at noon eastern standard time on January 20, 2017.

Christian symbolism

Christian symbolism gives objects or actions a meaning that shows Christian ideas. Religious symbolism has an effect when it affects both the intellect and the emotions. The choice of actions and objects for symbolism is very small. This makes it hard to chose a symbol that other religions and traditions do not use.

Elemental symbols were often used by the early Church. Water is an important symbol to Christians. Water is symbolic in baptism. It may also mean cleansing or purity. Fire symbolizes both the Holy Spirit and light. It is often used in the form of a candle flame. The sources of these symbols comes from the Bible. Examples include the "tongues of fire" that symbolized the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, Jesus' description of his followers as "the light of the world", and "God is a consuming fire" found in .

The fish was the most important symbol to early Christians. The symbolic fish was familiar to Christians from the earliest times. It can be seen in Roman monuments such as the Capella Greca and the Sacrament Chapels of the catacomb of St Callistus. The fish was used as a Christian symbol in the first decades of the 2nd century. The symbol may come from the miracle Jesus is said to have performed by multiplying loaves of bread and fishes on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Its popularity is thought to mainly come from an acrostic made of the first letters of five Greek words "Iesous CHristos THeou Yios Soter". These form the Greek word "Ichthys" which means fish. "Iesous Christos Theou Yios Soter" translates as "Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour".

The cross is one of the most well known symbols in the world. It was used as a symbol from the earliest times. This is shown in arguments against Christianity shown in the "Octavius" of Minucius Felix

In the early 3rd century, Clement of Alexandria, used the phrase "" (the Lord's sign) to mean the cross. He used the phrase when discussing that the number 318 (in Greek numerals, ΤΙΗ) in was a foreshadowing of the cross and Jesus. T is the Greek number fore 300. ΙΗ, the first two letters of Jesus's name ΙΗΣΟΥΣ, means 18. Tertullian called the Christian believers "crucis religiosi", "i.e." "devotees of the Cross". In his book "De Corona", Tertullian tells how it was a tradition for Christians to trace the sign of the cross on their foreheads.

The crucifix was not used until the 5th century. French Medievalist historian M.-M. Davy has described in great details Romanesque Symbolism as it developed in the Middle Ages in Western Europe.

Ancient people believed that the flesh of a peafowl did not decay after death. It became a symbol of immortality. This symbolism was used by early Christianity. Many early Christian paintings and mosaics show the peacock. The peacock is still used in the Easter season in the east.

Some of the oldest symbols in the Christian church are the sacraments. The number of sacraments is different in each denominations. All denominations have Eucharist and baptism. Others which may or may not be used are ordination, unction, confirmation, penance and marriage. The rites are seen as a symbol of the spiritual change or event that takes place. In the Eucharist, the bread and wine are symbolic of the body and blood of Jesus. In Roman Catholicism, they become the "actual" Body of Christ and Blood of Christ through Transubstantiation. This represent salvation brought by the death of Jesus. The rite of baptism is symbolic of the cleansing of the sinner by God. Where baptism is by immersion, it symbolizes spiritual death and resurrection. Different groups believe the sacraments mean different things. Some Protestant denominations think they are only symbolic. Roman Catholics, Orthodox, some Anglicans, and some Lutherans feel that, by the power of God, the sacraments have an actual effect."




Bohemia at the Olympics

Kingdom of Bohemia, took part in some of the early modern Olympic Games. It was an autonomous part of Austria-Hungary until 1918. The team began taking part in the Olympics at the 1900 Summer Olympics. After World War I, Bohemia became part of Czechoslovakia. Bohemian athletes competed for Czechoslovakia at the Olympics. After Czechoslovakia was split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993, Bohemian athletes competed for the Czech Republic at the Olympics. Bohemian athletes have missed only three Olympics: the first in 1896, the 1904 Summer Olympics (the first not to take place in Europe) and the boycotted 1984 Summer Olympics.

Hedwiga Rosenbaumová also won a bronze medal with Archibald Warden of Great Britain (GBR) in the mixed doubles event in tennis at the 1900 Summer Olympics. This medal is listed as being won by a mixed team instead of split between Bohemia and Great Britain.

American Vampire

American Vampire is an Eisner Award-winning comic book series. It was created by writer Scott Snyder and Rafael Albuquerque.

In the series, the vampire population is made up of many different species. Most people do not know vampires exist. The series shows how vampires evolve and deal with conflict between the species throughout history. The series is mostly about a new American species of vampires. This group was born American West in the late 1800s. The first of this new species is an outlaw named Skinner Sweet. After becoming a vampire, Sweet leans that he is a new kind of vampire. He is stronger and faster than other species. Sunlight does not hurt him. He has new strengths. He also has different weaknesses. The series shows his movements through several decades of American history. It also follows the only vampire he is known to have created, Pearl Jones. Jones is a young woman who was trying to work as an actress in the 1920s silent film industry. She was attacked by a group of European vampires who were hiding in Hollywood. Sweet saved her by giving her his blood. This turned her into an American vampire like him. After this, tried to get revenge on the vampires who attacked her. The relationship between Jones and Sweet is an important part of the series.

The first five issues had two stories in each issue. One story was by Snyder and the other by Stephen King. Both stories were drawn by Rafael Albuquerque. As of the sixth issue, Scott Snyder became the only writer. In its second year of publication, a spin-off mini-series was created. It was titled "American Vampire: Survival of the Fittest". This mini-series was drawn by Sean Murphy. It is about a vampire-hunting organization from the main series.

The series was first published on March 17, 2010. This is the first comic using original Stephen King writing.


Basal

'Basal' is a term in biology for 'primitive' or 'ancestral'. Basal is preferred because it is neutral and non-judgmental. This terminology came into use with cladistics. The term is used in evolution and classification to mean the group which gave rise to later forms. It is a term which works at any level: a basal species gives rise to derived species, and a basal group gives rise to derived groups.

'Derived' is the correct term in biology for "specialised" or "advanced". It is used for groups which have evolved from a more basal group. A derived trait is a trait that is present in an organism, but was not in the last common ancestor of the group being considered. Simplicity is often secondarily derived. For example, no mitochondria in the anaerobic protist "Entamoeba histolytica" is a result of their secondary loss.



In the last example, note that apes are "derived" from monkeys but "basal" with respect to our own genus. The status of being basal or derived is relative, though living species can only be derived. In any basal-derived pair, the basal member must have evolved before the derived member, with evidence that some of its species gave rise to (evolved into) the derived member.

Electronic dance music

Electronic dance music, often simplified as EDM, (occasionally referred to as electronica or dance) is a form of electronic music which is meant to be danced to, often in the setting of a nightclub, discothèque or party. Generally, electronic dance music is created by producers and composers, and is then used by DJs, or disc jockeys, in the above settings. Electronic dance music takes many forms and styles. As a genre, it is generally up-tempo music created by electronic software and machines, such as synthesizers, drum machines, keyboards, samplers, sequencers and computers. Occasionally, the term "techno" is used to describe electronic dance music in general, despite being a generalisation as techno is a distinguishable subgenre of EDM.

Being quite a generic term, EDM has a variety of 'origins' and derivations. EDM can be said to stem from a fusion between regular dance music and electronic music. One notable example can be Donna Summer's 1977 single "I Feel Love", which combined elements of disco with electronic music. The innovative blend helped trigger several major EDM genres, such as Hi-NRG, Eurodance and techno music. Giorgio Moroder, who co-wrote the song and was also one of its producers, additionally created some of the earliest forms of electronic dance music. Kraftwerk are also credited as influencing electronic music. Whilst a lot of electronic dance music originates from disco, this is not the case for all EDM.

The song which has been credited as bringing EDM into mainstream popular music is Madonna's 1998 single "Ray of Light". Whilst it is attributed as helping bring the genre mainstream, electronic dance music existed and had enjoyed popularity years before the single's release; house music, for instance, had been popular in the United States since the early 1990s (its popularity can also be attributed to another Madonna single, 1990's "Vogue"). 

There are different types of EDM, each varying in style, beats per minute and sound. This is a list of some of the major electronic dance music genres (each genre may additionally have further subgenres, which have not been looked at in too much detail for this section)


Heisei period

, also known as the Heisei era, is the after "Shōwa and before Reiwa". This period started in February 1989 and ended on April 30, 2019 with the emperor's abdication. During this time, the emperor was , 

The years in which Akihito has been the Japanese monarch comprise this period or era.







E pluribus unum

"E pluribus unum" is a traditional motto of the United States. It means "out of many, one" in Latin. It has been placed on the U.S. dollar bill, and other related items.

The motto was suggested by the first Great Seal committee in 1776. Consultant and artist Pierre Du Simitière chose the Latin motto, and his design expresses this theme.

This motto was well known to literate Americans of the 18th century. It had appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine, published monthly in London since 1731, with copies reaching the colonies. The legend "E pluribus unum" was used on the title pages of the magazine's annual compilation volumes.

In Thomson's 1782 sketch, for the final design, Charles Thomson put this motto on a scroll held in the bald eagle's beak.

"E pluribus unum" is a clear reference to the Thirteen Colonies united into one nation – symbolized by the shield on the eagle's breast. As explained in the official description of the Great Seal, the thirteen vertical stripes "represent the several states all joined in one solid compact entire, supporting a Chief, which unites the whole & represents Congress. The Motto alludes to this union."

An Outcast of the Islands

An Outcast of the Islands is the second novel by Joseph Conrad. It was published in 1896. It was based on Conrad's experience working on a steamer (ship), the "Vigar".

The novel tells about the fall of Peter Willems. He is a bad man, and has a bad reputation. On the run from a scandal in Makassar, he finds a place to hide in a hidden native village. However, he betrays the people who are helping him, because of lust for the tribal chief's daughter. The story features the character Tom Lingard, who Conrad uses lots, and also appears in "Almayer's Folly" (1895) and "The Rescue" (1920). It shares other characters with those novels.

This novel was made into a movie in 1952 by director Carol Reed, starring Trevor Howard as Willems, Ralph Richardson as Lingard, Robert Morley, and Wendy Hiller.

The work was quoted in T. S. Eliot's "The Hollow Men": "Life is very long.".

Scipionyx

Scipionyx samniticus is one of the most important recent dinosaur finds. It is a tiny theropod (meat-eater) fossil found in Cretaceous limestone in southern Italy near Naples. Although it was unearthed thirty years ago in 1981, its true importance was not realized until 1994. It is a very important specimen in that it has fossilized remains of many of its internal organs and muscles. This type of detail is rare in fossils since the soft tissues from an animal do not usually fossilize; they almost always rot before mineral replacement can take place. This new fossil will yield a lot of information about dinosaurs' anatomy and physiology as it is studied.

The fossil is a theropod, perhaps a compsognathid (related to "Compsognathus"). It is a hatchling 9.5 inches (24 cm) long. It is from 113 million years ago (during the Cretaceous period) and has been named "Scipionyx samniticus". During the Cretaceous period it lived near a shallow lagoon.

Battle of Messines

The Battle of Messines was a battle which happened in the Western front of the First World War. It began on 7 June 1917 when the British Second Army, which was commanded by General Herbert Plumer, attacked near the village of Mesen (Messines) in West Flanders, Belgium. The attack was meant to capture a ridge which ran north from Messines village, past Wytschaete village. This ridge was a natural place where you could keep safe southeast of Ypres. One thing which happened during the battle which was unusual was that 19 mines were set off just before the infantry attack. This was a tactic which made German defences disorganised. This allowed the troops to do what they were supposed to do very quickly. The attack also came before the much larger battle, the Third Battle of Ypres, usually known as Passchendaele, which began on 31 July 1917.

Döbereiner's lamp

Döbereiner's lamp is one of the first lighters. It was developed in 1823 by the German chemist Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner. The lighter was produced until around 1880. The Heidelberg Castle and also the Deutsches Museum ("German Museum") still have original Döbereiner lamps to show.

The lighter works based on a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. In the glass cylinder ("a" in the picture on the right) is sulfuric acid. In the open bottle ("b") is zinc and at the top is a valve. With the lever ("f"), the bottle will be opened. Then, the sulfuric acid flows into the bottle. When it reaches the Zinc, a reaction starts. It produces hydrogen.

formula_1

The hydrogen can go out of the bottle at the top. Next to the valve, there is platinum. The hydrogen gas has to bypass the platinum. The hydrogen and the oxygen from the air react because of the catalytic effect of platinum. The gas mixture (called oxyhydrogen) then burns, because the reaction is exothermic, and produces water.

formula_2

To stop this reaction, the bottle only needs to be closed, that means the lever needs to be released. The hydrogen can no longer go out of the bottle and pushes the sulfuric acid back into the glass cylinder.

Macron

A macron ( ¯ ), from the Greek ("makrón"), meaning "long", is a diacritic mark commonly placed above a single character or symbol (particularly vowels).

In the romanization of Japanese, a letter with macron represents a long vowel.

In the written Hawaiian language, the "kahakō" is shown by a macron.

In mathematics, a macron (or overline) is often placed above a symbol to refer to a complex conjugate, a sample mean and a logical negation. 

Bulgaria at the Olympics

Bulgaria was first at the Olympic Games at the very first Games in 1896.

The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for Bulgaria is BUL.

The Bulgarian Olympic Committee was formed in 1923. They first sent a team to the Summer Olympic Games in 1924. The nation has been in every Summer Games since except for 1932 (during the Great Depression), 1948 (after World War II), and 1984. Bulgaria was first in the Winter Olympic Games in 1936, and has been in every Winter Games since then.

Bulgarian athletes have won a total of 218 medals, with wrestling and weightlifting the most.


WYSIWYM

WYSIWYM is an acronym that stands for What you see is what you mean. This was positioned to not be confused with WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get). The idea behind WYSIWYG is to display text on screen in much the same way as they will appear when printed on paper. WYSIWYM is different from this: The content is structured. When the content is entered, this meaning is added to the text. This will mean that presentation is separated from the content. The content is translated before it is rendered. This also means that it can be translated differently, the same content can lead to different output formats. More importantly though, the person editing the document can focus on the content, and is not easily distracted by what the content looks like. One of the drawbacks of the method is that the user is forced to think ahead. LaTeX is an example of a document processing system that uses WYSIWYM.

Phantom island

A phantom island is an island that was thought to exist at some point in time. Because of this, the island was shown on a map. Later, the islands were removed from maps. Some islands are described and later on change their name, or with the description given it is possible to associate a real island. Other islands sink below sea level because of natural causes such as erosion. Such islands still exist. Two examples are Earnest Legouve Reef and Maria-Theresa Reef in the South Pacific. Because they are far away from ships' routes, their existence can not be proved so far. In the year 1908, Robert Peary claimed to have found a lost continent, called Crocker Land. 

People such as João Vaz Corte-Real were rewarded for finding islands that turned out to be phantom islands. In the case given, the phantom island was Bacalao. The island showed up on maps in the early 16th century. Baccalieu Island is probably named after the phantom island.

Some phantom islands were later "found". That way Baja California was first thought to be an island. Later, people found it was in fact a peninsula. Thule was discovered in antiquity; in modern times, people who found it may have talked about Norway, the Orkney Islands, Shetland or Scandinavia. Other interpretations include Iceland, Greenland, or the island Saaremaa in the Baltic Sea.

Other phantom islands may exist because of mistakes in navigation, or optical illusions, such as superior mirage. One example of this is New South Greenland, which was observed in the Weddell Sea in 1823, and has not been seen since. 

Some phantom islands may have existed, but they have been destroyed, or are no longer above the water line. These include Thompson Island in the South Atlantic, and Bermeja, off the coast of Yucatán. 

Aerogel

Aerogel is a gel in which the liquid part has been replaced with a gas (usually air). It was invented in 1931 by Samuel Stephens Kistler. The most common type of aerogel is silica aerogel, which is made from the same molecule as glass. It is a solid material that is almost as light as air. It is the world's lightest material. Its melting point is 1200 degrees Celsius, which is comparable to crocidolite asbestos. Aerogel is the best thermal insulator available and can be used in construction in place of fiberglass insulation. It allows better insulation with less material, although it is much more expensive than fiberglass. It is also brittle, making it more difficult to install than fiberglass. Most aerogel is not water-resistant, and even small amounts of water can destroy it. It is also safer than fiberglass or asbestos because it is not known to cause cancer if inhaled into the lungs. Some aerogel insulation, however, contains fiberglass to increase its flexibility.

Red Bull GmbH

Red Bull GmbH is an Austrian company that sells the Red Bull energy drink. Billions of cans are sold in over 161 countries. The company has 7,758 employees and earned 3.78 billion euros in 2010. The headquarters of Red Bull GmbH are in Fuschl am See, Austria.

Dietrich Mateschitz started the company with Chaleo Yoovidhya. The company brought the energy drink Krating Daeng from Thailand to Europe and around the world. Krating Daeng means "red bull" in Thai. Mateschitz runs the company and Yoovidhya and his son are silent partners. Red Bull GmbH made a new “Austrian” Red Bull drink in 1987. It is carbonated and not as sweet as the Thai drink. The Austrian version of the drink has almost half of the U.S. market for energy drinks. It has up to 80% of the market in some other countries.

The company supports many sports teams. It also puts its logos on many airplanes and sports cars to attract attention.


2013 Atlantic hurricane season

The 2013 Atlantic hurricane season was a well below average season. The season started on June 1 and ended on November 30. The season began when Tropical Storm Andrea formed on June 5, 2013. It became a subtropical storm on June 7 before making a landfall 310 miles (500 km) southwest of Tampa, Florida. Seventeen days later, Tropical Storm Barry developed. It became a post-tropical storm on June 7. On July 8, Tropical Storm Chantal formed. It later became a post-tropical system on July 10. The season finished on November 30, 2013. The season was the first Atlantic Hurricane season since 1994 to end with no known major hurricanes.

Tropical storm Andrea developed on the 5th of June within the southern gulf of Mexico. The storm slowly strengthen as it moved northeastward making landfall around 2200z on the 6th in northeastern Florida. The system maximum intensity hit 55 knots.

Tropical storm Barry developed as a depression within the gulf of Honduras from a westward moving tropical wave on the 17th of June. The system later that day made landfall within Belize and moved across the Yucatán the next few days...The system moved into the bay of Campeche and the hurricane hunters found tropical storm force winds on the 19th before landfall.

The following names will be used for named storms that form in the North Atlantic in 2013. The names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2019 season. This is the same list used in the 2007 season, except for Dorian, Fernand, and Nestor which replaced Dean, Felix, and Noel.
On April 12, 2014, the name Ingrid was retired and was replaced by Imelda for the 2019 season.


Wakulla County, Florida

Wakulla County is a county in the U.S. state of Florida. As of 2020, 33,764 people lived there. Its county seat is Crawfordville. Wakulla County is part of the Tallahassee, Florida, Metropolitan Statistical Area.

In 1528, Panfilo de Narvaez found what would be Wakulla County. He had left Tampa, Florida and was camping where the Wakulla River and St. Marks River joined together. Narvaez felt this was a good place to build a fort. In 1539, Hernando de Soto followed with his soldiers. They created San Marcos de Apalache.

The area was an active place in the early 19th century. A former British officer named William Augustus Bowles led 400 Creek Indians in an attack to take control of San Marcos. This angered Spain. A Spanish flotilla got to the area about 5 weeks later. The Spanish took control of San Marcos. In 1818, General Andrew Jackson attacked (Wakulla) and took control of San Marcos. Two British people, Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot, were said to have started Indian raids. They were found guilty of the crime and killed. This caused large diplomatic problems between the United States and England. In 1821, Florida was became a part of the United States. San Marcos controlled by U.S. troops. In 1824, the fort was no longer used. Control of it was given to the Territory of Florida. By 1839, the fort was returned to the U.S. A federal marine hospital was built. The hospital helped people with yellow fever in the area.

Wakulla County was created from Leon County in 1843. It may be named for the Timucuan Indian word for "spring of water" or "mysterious water." This is because of Wakulla County's best natural attraction, Wakulla Springs. Wakulla Springs is one of the world's largest freshwater springs. In 1974, the water flow was measured at per day. This is the greatest recorded flow ever for a single spring.
At one time, the town of Port Leon was a very busy cotton-shipping hub. It had a railroad that carried over 50,000 tons of cotton a year. This cotton was sent to ship which mostly went to Europe. Port Leon was the sixth-largest town in Florida. 1,500 people lived there. A hurricane and its storm surge destroyed the town. New Port (today known as Newport) was built two miles (3 km) up river. It never did as well as Port Leon.

During the Civil War, Wakulla County was blockaded from 1861-1865. Confederates took control of San Marcos de Apalache. They changed the name to Fort Ward. The Battle of Natural Bridge stopped the Union force that tried to take Fort Ward and nearby Tallahassee. Tallahassee was the last Confederate state capitol that the Union had not captured. The Union forces were not able use all their soldiers. They still had more soldiers than the Confederates. The Confederates chose to fight at a place where the St Marks River goes underground. This was the "Natural Bridge' the battle was named for. The Confederates had over a day to get ready for the battle. The Union could not win and left. Most of the people who died in the battle were African-American soldiers fighting for the Union. A celebration was held in Tallahassee. It was stopped when a telegram arrived telling them about General Lee's surrender at Appomattox.

From the early 1900s to 1966, Wakulla was very poor. It had no doctor and no dentist. There were only a small number of stores in the county. The county newspaper was printed just once a month on a mimeograph machine. Today, Wakulla has several doctors and dentists, There are several supermarkets and retailers. The county has a golf resort and a very good seafood business.

The county has a total area of . (or 82.46%) of this area is land and (or 17.54%) is water. Wakulla County is part of the Tallahassee Metropolitan Statistical Area.



As of the census of 2020, there were 33,764 people and 11,266 households in the county. There were 55 people for each square mile (21/km²). The racial makeup of the county was 78.82% White, 12.59% Black, 0.60% Asian, 0.49% Native American, 0.06% Pacific Islander, 1.61% from other races, and 5.83% from two or more races. 4.67% of the people were Hispanic or Latino of any race.



Wakulla County is unusual in that it has almost no municipal population. The two very small municipalities have about 3 percent of the people. The county seat, Crawfordville, is the only unincorporated county seat of Florida's 67 counties.

There are no Interstate highways in Wakulla County. Several large roads do go through the area. These include U.S. Route 98 and U.S. Route 319. Other important roads in the county include State Road 267, State Road 363 and County Road 375.

There are currently no railroads in Wakulla County. In the past, the Georgia, Florida and Alabama Railroad passed through Sopchoppy moving between Tallahassee and Carrabelle. The use of this railroad ended in 1948, The Tallahassee Railroad, the first railroad in Florida, stopped being used in 1983.

The Wakulla County Airport (2J0)is south of Panacea. It is a small public-use airport. The airport has with a single , north-south turf runway.

St. Marks is a small commercial seaport. In the past, it had some importance in the oil industry. It is currently used mainly by commercial fishermen.

Edward Weston (chemist)

Edward Weston (May 9, 1850 – August 20, 1936) was an English-born American chemist noted for his achievements in electroplating and his development of the electrochemical cell, named the Weston cell, for the voltage standard. Weston was a competitor of Thomas Edison in the early days of electricity generation and distribution.

Born in Oswestry, Shropshire, England, in 1850 to a merchant family, Weston first studied medicine but grew interested in chemistry. He emigrated to the United States after receiving his medical diploma in 1870. He then found a job in the electroplating industry. He saw the need for a constant source of current. He developed an interest in power generation and invented several dynamos and generators. He eventually co-founded the Weston Electric Light Company in Newark, New Jersey and later got the contract to light the Brooklyn Bridge. Weston was a founding member of the board of trustees of what later became the New Jersey Institute of Technology. Some of his inventions, instruments, and writings are maintained at the university's library and at its Weston Museum. Weston was president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers from 1888-89.

He invented two alloys, constantan and manganin. Weston developed measurement instruments for electrical current—the modern foundation for the voltmeter, ammeter and wattmeter. In 1888, he formed the Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation which was known for its voltmeters, ammeters, wattmeters, ohmmeters, frequency meters, transformers, and transducers. Weston developed a method for producing a "true" permanent magnet. Weston conceived of and built a magnetic speedometer. Weston also developed the dashboard ammeter for Harley-Davidson motorcycles.

Weston invented and patented the saturated cadmium cell in 1893. The cathode in the cell is an amalgam of cadmium with mercury. The anode is of pure mercury, and the electrolyte is a solution of cadmium sulphate. The Weston cell is a wet-chemical cell that produces a highly stable voltage suitable as a laboratory standard for calibration of voltmeters. The temperature coefficient was reduced by shifting to an unsaturated design, the predominant type today. When the Weston cell became the International Standard for EMF in 1911, Weston waived his patent rights.

Weston died in Montclair, New Jersey in 1936. He got 309 United States patents during his life.


Weston's son Edward Faraday Weston (1878–1971) received several patents regarding exposure meters, also manufactured by the Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation and widely distributed since the 1930s, and established the system of the Weston film speed ratings for the measurement of film speeds.




Springfield, Missouri

Springfield is the third largest city in the state of Missouri and the county seat of Greene County. According to the 2020 census data, the population was 169,176, an increase of 6.1% since the 2020 census. The Springfield Metropolitan Area has a population of 436,712 and includes the counties of Christian, Dallas, Greene, Polk and Webster. Springfield's nickname is the Queen City of the Ozarks and is known as the Birthplace of Route 66 as well as the home of several universities including Missouri State University.

Springfield’s economy is based on health care, manufacturing, retail, education and tourism. With a Gross Metropolitan Product of $13.66 billion in 2004, Springfield's economy makes up 6.7% of the Gross State Product of Missouri.

Total retail sales exceed $4.1 billion a year in Springfield and $5.8 billion in the Springfield MSA. Its largest shopping mall is Battlefield Mall. According to the Springfield Convention & Visitors Bureau, an estimated three million overnight visitors and millions of day-trippers visit the city annually. The city has more than 60 lodging facilities and 6,000 hotel rooms. The Convention & Visitors Bureau spends more than $1 million annually marketing the city as a travel destination.

Positronic, Bass Pro Shops, John Q. Hammons Hotels & Resorts, BKD, Noble & Associates, Prime, Inc., and O'Reilly Auto Parts have their national headquarters in Springfield. 

Two major American Christian denominations are based in Springfield: General Council of the Assemblies of God in the United States of America (one of the largest of the Pentecostal denominations) and Baptist Bible Fellowship International (a fundamentalist Baptist denomination with roots to J. Frank Norris).

Springfield is called the "Birthplace of U.S. Route 66". It was in Springfield on April 30, 1926 that officials first proposed the name of the new Chicago-to-Los Angeles highway.

John T. Woodruff of Springfield was elected as the first president of the U.S. Highway 66 Association. It was organized in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1927. Its purpose was to get U.S. 66 paved from end to end and to promote tourism on the highway. In 1938, Route 66 became the first completely paved United States Numbered Highways in America. Called the “Mother Road”, it stretched from the Great Lakes to the Pacific Coast.

A placard in Park Central Square was dedicated to the city by the Route 66 Association of Missouri. Traces of the Mother Road are still visible in Downtown Springfield along Kearney Street, Glenstone Avenue, College and St. Louis streets and on Missouri 266 to Halltown. The red booths and gleaming chrome in mom and pop diners, the stone cottages of tourist courts and the many service stations along this route saw America fall in love with the automobile. Red's Giant Hamburg, said to be the birthplace of the drive-up order window, was located on the route.


Crocker Land

Crocker Land is the name for a supposed eighth continent in the Arctic Ocean. In the year 1906, Robert Peary thought he had seen a landmass, which he named after George Crocker, a member of Peary Arctic Club. He thought that the land was about 130 miles (210 km) north of Ellesmere Island, at 83 degrees north and 100 degrees west. 

In 1913, the Crocker Land expedition started, to find Crocker Land. This expedition turned out to be a failure. The captain of the first ship became drunk and ran aground on the rocks. Later an Inuit guide was deliberately shot and killed by one of the expedition members under suspicious circumstances. The expedition eventually became stranded and was not rescued until four years later.

The MacGregor Arctic Expedition in 1937–1938 also took aerial photographs. These show that there is no land at that location. Despite this, some pseudo-scientific organizations still try to present a case for its possible existence.

The expedition did not find Crocker Land. Later, satellite images showed that the continent did not exist, and could not be found. Today, it is believed that what Peary saw, was a fata morgana mirage.

Bradley Land

Bradley Land is the name of a landmass Frederick Cook claimed to have seen during a expedition in 1909. He said, the land between positions () and (). He described it as two masses of land with a break, a strait, or an indentation between. The land was named for John R. Bradley, who had sponsored Cook's expedition.

Cook published two photographs of the land and described it as follows: "The lower coast resembled Heiberg Island, with mountains and high valleys. The upper coast I estimated as being about one thousand feet high, flat, and covered with a thin sheet ice." 

It is now known there is no land at that location. Cook's observations were based on either a misidentification of sea ice or an outright fabrication. Cook's Inuit companions reported that the photographs were actually taken near the coast of Axel Heiberg Island.

2015 Atlantic hurricane season

The 2015 Atlantic hurricane season had a little less storms than usual, 11 storms, and four of them reached hurricane status. It officially started on June 1 and ended on November 30. This is when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic. However the first named storm, Ana, developed nearly a month before the official start of the season, the first time this has happened since 2012’s Beryl and the earliest a hurricane has happened since 2003’s Ana. The season ended with the diminish of Kate 18 days before the official end.

Due to a strong El Niño, most agencies predicted that only 6–10 tropical cyclones would form; however, the number of tropical cyclones that formed this season was higher than what the agencies predicted.

In the spring of 2016, the WMO (World Meteorological Organization) had retired the names "Erika" and Joaquin. Those names will not be used again in the Atlantic. Elsa and Julian were chosen to replace those names for the 2021 season. 

Genroku

The years of "Genroku" are generally considered to be the Golden Age of the Edo period. A century of peace and seclusion created good economic conditions and cultural growth.

The "nengō" "Genroku" means "Origin of Good Fortune"




Anthony Horowitz

Anthony Craig Horowitz (born 5 April 1956) is an English novel writer and screenwriter. He has written many children's novels, including "The Power of Five", "Alex Rider" and "The Diamond Brothers" series. He has written over fifty books. He has also written many things for television. He has adapted many of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot novels for the ITV series. He is the creator and writer of the ITV series "Foyle's War", "Midsomer Murders" and "Collision".

Anthony Horowitz was born in 1956 in Middlesex. His family were Jewish. When he was young, he lived an upper-class lifestyle.<nowiki></nowiki> Horowitz was overweight and unhappy. He enjoyed reading books from his father's library. At the age of eight, Horowitz was sent to a boarding school. The school was called Orley Farm. It was in Harrow, Middlesex. There, he entertained others by telling them the stories he had read. Horowitz said that his time in the school was "a brutal experience". He said that he was often beaten by the headmaster John Ellis.

Horowitz's father was a "fixer" for prime minister Harold Wilson. Because he was nearly bankrupt, he moved his money into Swiss bank accounts. He died from cancer when his son, Anthony, was 22. The family was never able to find the missing money, even though they had tried for years. Horowitz loved his mother. She showed him "Frankenstein" and "Dracula". She also gave him a human skull for his 13th birthday. Horowitz said in an interview once that it reminds him to get to the end of each story because he will soon look like the skull. From the age of eight, Horowitz knew he wanted to be a writer, realising "the only time when I'm totally happy is when I'm writing". He graduated from the University of York with a BA in English literature in 1977.

In at least one interview, Horowitz said that believes H. P. Lovecraft based his fictional "Necronomicon" on real writing, and to have read some of that writing.

Horowitz lives in North London with his wife Jill Green. He married her in Hong Kong on 15 April 1988. Green produces "Foyle's War". Horowitz writes this series for ITV. They have two sons. They are Nicholas Mark Horowitz (born 1989) and Cassian James Horowitz (born 1991). The family have a dog named Lucky, that has been run over 3 times.

Horowitz is a patron of child protection charity Kidscape.













Keiō

The "nengō" "Keiō" means "Joyous Concord" 










In 1868, the emperor moved his Imperial court to Tokyo; and Edo castle became an Imperial palace. In this way, the capital of Japan moved from Kyoto to Tokyo.

Keio University was named after this era. It is the oldest existing institution of higher learning in Japan.



Tulisa

Tula Paulinea Contostavlos (born 13 July 1988), known as Tulisa, is a British singer, songwriter and actress of Greek and Irish ancestry. She was a member of the Camden-based hip hop group N-Dubz. Tulisa was also a judge on "The X Factor". 

Tula Paulinea Contostavlos was born on 13 July 1988 in Camden Town, London. When Contostavlos was five, her mother, who has bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder, was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. The 2010 BBC programme, "Tulisa: My Mum and Me", described Contostavlos' life looking after her mother before joining N-Dubz.

On 9 March 2020, Contostavlos revealed she suffered from Bell's palsy.

Her Irish mother, Anne Byrne, was born in Churchtown, Dublin. Anne and her three sisters were in a 1980's big band and swing group, called Jeep. Contostavlos' father, Plato Contostavlos, is Greek-Cypriot and at one time was keyboardist with Mungo Jerry. Plato's brother, Byron Contostavlos, was bassist with Mungo Jerry and later became the manager of N-Dubz.

Tulisa was in the band N-Dubz with her cousin Dappy and their friend Fazer. The group became very popular. Tulisa was a celebrity judge on "The X Factor" in 2011 and 2012. She mentored the "Groups" category in 2011. They included Little Mix, the first group to win the competition. Tulisa returned to the show in 2014 because Mel B was ill.

As a singer, Contostavlos has recorded three studio albums with N-Dubz, "Uncle B" (2008), "Against All Odds" (2009) and "Love.Live.Life" (2010). In 2011, she started work on a solo album. In 2012 it was released. "The Female Boss" got a lot of bad reviews and didn't chart well. Three singles were released from the album. The first single, "Young", entered the UK Singles Chart at number one.

In 2022, N-Dubz went on a reunion tour. They have also appeared on "Celebrity" "Gogglebox" together since 2023.

In June 2013, Costostavlos, along with rapper Mike GLC were arrested on suspicion of supplying class A drugs. In July 2014, Contostavlos' trial for supplying cocaine ended because it was discovered that the journalist who accused her, Mazher Mahmood, had lied to the court.

In July 2014, she made a documentary about her time during the trial named "Tulisa: The Price of Fame," which premiered on BBC Three to a moderate success, attracting 615,000 viewers (3.8% of the audience within its time slot). In April 2015, Justice Nicholas Kearns, President of the Irish High Court, described her as having been "cruelly deceived in a shabby sting operation", but dismissed her attempt to sue the "Irish Sun" for defamation.

After the collapse of her drug trial, "The Guardian" Suzanne Moore wrote an article on Contostavlos image and reputation and wrote that "Tulisa is famously a working class girl made good, though of course made good is never what she is allowed to be". In Moore's opinion, "Tulisa has been branded by the media as a chav and therefore almost anything can be said about her".


Alexandra Stan

Alexandra Stan (born June 10, 1989 in Constanța, Romania as Alexandra Ioana Stan) is a Romanian singer-songwriter, model and occasional dancer. She begun her career by releasing her debut single ""Lollipop (Param Pam Pam)"", which was diffused by radio stations around the world, but failed to enter any international chart. Her next single ""Mr. Saxobeat"" was also distributed by her long-time managers and producers' label MAAN Studio. It became a worldwide success when it reached number-one on nine international charts and got Gold and Platinum certification awards around the world for selling an estimate of 10,000,000 copies of it worldwide. Her next records entitled ""Get Back (ASAP)"" and ""One Million"" were also praised and seen in charts around the world, especially in Eastern Europe. She released her debut album ""Saxobeats"" in late 2011. The record gained major sales and reached the top-forty in several album charts. 2013, Stan rose to fame after it was reported by worldwide newspapers that she was beaten by her manager Marcel Prodan, who she later sued for blackmailing and injuring.

Thompson Island (South Atlantic)

Thompson Island is a phantom island, in the South Atlantic. It was thought to be about 150 km north-northeast of Bouvet Island. 

Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier discovered Bouvet Island in 1739. In 1808, James Lindsay of the "Snow Swan" discovered Bouvet Island again, and named it "Lindsay Island". The next time, George Norris of the "Sprightly" sighted Bouvet on 10 December 1825. He landed on 16 December, and took possession of the island, which he named Liverpool Island, for King George IV of the United Kingdom.

Between December 13 and December 16, Norris sailed the waters northeast of Bouvet Island, where he discovered another island. It was much smaller, and the sea around it was much rougher. Three miles southeast of the newly discovered island, he found three rocks. In his log, he named the newly found island Thompson Island, and the rocks "chimneys", because of their form. He also marked the position of his discoveries on a map. Unfortunately, the positions of the islands on the map did not match those written down in the log. In 1853 the discoveries of Thompson Island, Bouvet Island, and the Chimneys showed up on an official map of the British admiralty. 

In 1893, Captain Joseph J. Fuller reported another sighting of Thompson Island, on his ship, "Francis Allyn".

The Valdivia expedition wanted to find the exact position of Bouvet and Thompson Island, in November 1898, but was unable to find Thompson Island.

In 1915, a German ship, the "Meteor", gave a depth of the sea of 1579 m at the position where Thompson had been reported. If Thompson ever existed, it is probable that it disappeared in a volcanic eruption sometime in the 1890s.

The Norwegian Arctic Expedition (1928/29) failed to find Thompson Island, and declared it did not exist.

Thompson Island continued to appear on maps published as late as 1943.

The only person to have seen Thompson Island was probably Norris. Fuller's description of Thompson Island matches more or less that given of Bouvet Island in Norris' diary, and is therefore questionable. 

Daniel Carleton Gajdusek

Daniel Carleton Gajdusek (September 9, 1923 - December 12, 2008) was an American physician and medical researcher. He and Baruch Samuel Blumberg won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1976. They got the Nobel for work on kuru. Kuru is the first human prion disease shown to be infectious.

Gajdusek's father, Karol Gajdusek, was from Büdöskö, Kingdom of Hungary, now Smrdáky, Slovakia. He was an ethnic Slovak who was a butcher. His mother's parents from Debrecen, Hungary. Gajdusek was born in Yonkers, New York. He graduated from the University of Rochester in 1943. Gajdusek studied physics, biology, chemistry and mathematics. He got an M.D. from Harvard University in 1946. His postdoctoral research was done at Columbia University, the California Institute of Technology, and Harvard. In the early 1950s, Gajdusek was drafted into the military as a research virologist at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. In 1954 he went to work at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, Australia. In Australia, he began the work that led to his getting the Nobel Prize.

Gajdusek's best-known work was on kuru. This disease was affecting many people among the South Fore people of New Guinea in the 1950s and 1960s. Gajdusek felt there was a connect between the spread of the disease and the funerary cannibalism by the South Fore people. He lived among the Fore and studied their language and culture. He also performed autopsies on people who died of kuru.

Gajdusek thought that kuru was spread by the ritualistic eating of the brains of dead family members. He proved this idea by infecting primates with the disease and showing that it had an very long incubation period of several years. When the cannibalism was stopped, kuru stopped spreading in just one generation. This was the first time it was shown that a non-inflammatory degenerative disease could be spread in humans.

Gajdusek was not able to identify what exactly spreads kuru. Other research by Stanley Prusiner and others led to the finding of proteins called prions that caused these disease and other similar diseases.

Some people in the medical community, do not think that cannibalism was still practiced when Gajdusek did his research. Willam Arens, an anthropologist, says that Gajdusek never saw cannibalism himself. Researchers who worked with the Fore in the 1950s say that cannibalism was stopped in 1948. This was almost a decade before Gajdusek went to New Guinea. Many other researchers, including Robert Klitzman, S. Lindenbaum, R. Glasse, and researchers at the Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research have made reports that say that the cannibalism still happened.

Gajdusek became head of the laboratories for virological and neurological research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1958. He was made a part of the National Academy of Sciences in 1974.

During his trips in the South Pacific, Gajdusek had brought 56 children back to live with him in the United States. He gave them the chance to have high school and college education. Later, as an adult, one of these children said that Gajdusek molested him as a child.

Gajdusek was charged with child molestation in April 1996. This was based on things in his own diary and what the victim told police. He said this was true in 1997 and was sent to jail for 12 months. After he got out of jail in 1998, he went to Europe. He never returned to the United States and lived in Amsterdam, Paris, and Tromsø. Gajdusek openly admitted molesting boys and his approval of incest.

Gajdusek died December 12, 2008 in Tromsø, Norway, at the age of 85.


GIS

GIS may stand for Geographic Information Sciences or for Geographic Information System. These are two different but related things in geography. The Geographic Information Sciences include many fields of knowledge that help to understand geographic information while a Geographic Information System is a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of spatial or geographical data and allow for the study of "layers" of geographic information.

GIS also known as geographic information system is a computer system made for capturing and displaying positions on the earth’s surface and portraying data in many different ways on maps. Its main job is to help in analyzing groups of data and in finding correlations or patterns. For example a map could use GIS to find out the amount of rubbish in one area, and also include how many factories and types of factories are in that area.

GIS can store information about a location and help provide knowledge on many different topics in a location. Users can specify a place via latitude and longitude, postal code or address. Then GIS can provide information about the people in that area including: income, population and education levels. It can also tell about physical things such as soil types, vegetation, water sources, manmade structures like buildings and roads. 

Mike Pelino (ice hockey)

Mike Pelino (born November 13, 1959 in Welland, Ontario) is a Canadian Ice hockey coach. He has been an assistant coach for the New York Rangers from 2004 until 2009. Pelino started his coaching career in the NHL as an assistant coach for the Florida Panthers in 2003. In 2010, he became the head coach of the Peterborough Petes in the OHL.

Since 2013, he has been working for the Metallurg as an assistant coach in KHL. In the 2013/2014 season the team won Gagarin's Cup and became the KHL champions.

Carl Sandburg

Carl Sandburg (January 6, 1878 – July 22, 1967) was an American poet. He won several awards, including three Pulitzer Prizes. He also wrote a biography of Abraham Lincoln. The majority of his poems were about the city of Chicago. He was born in Galesburg, Illinois.


Hard Again

Hard Again is a album by Muddy Waters. It was produced by Johnny Winter who also played guitar. The record was his first for Blue Sky Records. It was also the first studio album after he left Chess Records

The recordings lasted three days. For the recordings Muddy used his then current touring band of guitarist Bob Margolin, pianist Pinetop Perkins, and drummer Willie "Big Eyes" Smith. James Cotton played harmonica and Charles Calmeses the bass.

Three of the songs on the album – "Mannish Boy", "I Want to Be Loved", and "I Can't Be Satisfied" – were re-recordings of songs for Chess Records. One of the songs recorded, "The Blues Had a Baby and They Named It Rock and Roll, Pt. 2", was co-written by Brownie McGhee and another song, "Bus Driver", was co-written by T. Abrahamson.

An outtake from the recording sessions, "Walking Through the Park", appeared on the 2004 Legacy Recordings reissue CD, while several more unused tracks appeared on "King Bee" in 1981.

The album has been well received by several critics. Dan Oppenheimer of "Rolling Stone" magazine said that "Mannish Boy" sounded like it was recorded live while both Oppenheimer and Daniel Gioffre of Allmusic state how powerful Willie "Big Eyes" Smith's drumming is. Oppenheimer, Gioffre, and Robert Christgau all share the opinion that "Hard Again" is Muddy Waters comeback album.

"Hard Again" peaked at #143 on the "Billboard" 200, which was his first appearance on the chart since "Fathers and Sons" in 1969.
All songs written by McKinley Morganfield, except where others are noted.

The following people contributed to "Hard Again":



First Boer War

In the 19th Century Scramble for Africa, the British Empire tried to control all of southern Africa. They won control of the Cape of Good Hope in 1815 at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Many Boers (Dutch, German and French farmers) did not like Britain controlling the area. The British taxed them, made English the official language, and in 1834 abolished slavery. Some of the Boers moved north in the Great Trek and made a new country called the Orange Free State. In 1877 the British Army moved in to control the Orange Free State in pursuit of diamonds, one of the Orange Free State's rich natural resources. On 16 December 1880 the First Boer War began. It took ten weeks in 1880 and 1881. The British were defeated.

From 1896 to 1899 Governor of the Cape and High Commissioner for South Africa, Alfred Milner made preparations for another war in order to gain the wealth of the Orange Free State and in September 1899 British troops arrived in South Africa. Paul Kruger president of the Transvaal sent Britain an ultimatum asking strongly for their departure.

Boer farmers from Sandspruit, Volksrust, the Orange Free State, and the Transvaal fought in the war. As the Boers lost men in battle they recruited young boys and old men to fight. Black people also fought alongside the Boers in the war and they made up 20 to 25 percent of total Boer manpower. The German Empire was friendly to their cause, and the Boers used Krupp guns. Much of the fighting was on horseback. As the Boers lost battle after battle they were eventually forced to make peace on the 23rd of March, 1902, and surrender to British authority.


Lilly Ledbetter

Lilly Ledbetter (born Lilly McDaniel April 1938) was the plaintiff in the American employment discrimination case "Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co." She has since become a women's equality activist.

Goodyear paid Ledbetter significantly less than men holding the same job. This violated the Equal Pay Act of 1963 which said that she could sue to get the pay difference. Her lawsuit eventually reached the Supreme Court. The court said that she waited too long to sue Goodyear. In response to the court decision, Congress passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which is named after her. Under the new law, other women will be able to get backpay after employers keep pay discrimination secret.

United States Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg stated:Lilly

Ledbetter was a supervisor at Goodyear Tire and Rubber’s plant in Gadsden, Alabama, from 1979 until her retirement in 1998. For most of those years, she worked as an area manager, a position largely occupied by men. Initially, Ledbetter’s salary was in line with the salaries of men performing substantially similar work. Over time, however, her pay slipped in comparison to the pay of male area managers with equal or less seniority. By the end of 1997, Ledbetter was the only woman working as an area manager and the pay discrepancy between Ledbetter and her 15 male counterparts was stark: Ledbetter was paid $3,727 per month; the lowest paid male area manager received $4,286 per month, the highest paid, $5,236.

On August 26, 2008 (Women's Equality Day), Ledbetter spoke at the Democratic National Convention, on the topic of pay equity.

In June 2011, she dined with New York Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, who introduced the Equal Rights Amendment the previous month, and Eleanor Smeal.


East Germany at the Olympics

The German Democratic Republic (GDR), or East Germany, sent athletes to the Olympic Games from 1956 until 1988. They have taken part in both the Summer and Winter Games. From 1956 through 1966, East German athletes were a part of a combined team from both East and West Germany. After 1966, the East Germans were a separate team. They won a total of 519 medals at the Olympics.

Germany was divided after World War II. Three separate states were created. German athletes tried to take part in the 1948 games but the Allies did not let this happen. Finally, in 1949, the National Olympic Committee for Germany was founded in the Western Federal Republic of Germany. The IOC accepted it as both of the larger two larger German states. The small, French-occupied Saarland and its NOC were separate until after 1955.

East German authorities of the "Nationales Olympisches Komitee für Ostdeutschland" did not send their athletes to the 1952 games in an all-German team. The wanted a team of their own. This was not allowed by the IOC.

East Germany agreed to take part in the 1956 Games. German athletes from the East and West Germany took part in the games in 1956, 1960 and 1964 as the United Team of Germany. This team was just called Germany at the time.

The GDR renamed their NOC to "Nationales Olympisches Komitee der DDR" in 1965. It was accepted by the IOC in 1968. At this point East Germany sent its own team to the Games. They did not take part in the in 1984 Summer Olympics due to the Soviet boycott.

Although East Germany had a small population of about 16 million, they did very well. From 1976 to 1988, they won the second most medals in each of their three summer Olympics, behind the Soviet Union. They did much better than the West Germany. In five winter games, they placed second four times and first in the 1984 Winter Olympics.

Many think that doping (mainly anabolic steroids) allowed East Germany to a world leader in sports for two decades. They won many Olympic and world gold medals but many athletes failed doping tests or were believed to be taking performance enhancing drugs. In many cases where doping was believed to happen, no proof was found so most of records and medals won by East German athletes still stand. Aside from doping, East Germany soent a lot of money on sporta - mainly Olympic sports. They did this for prestige, propaganda and rivalry with West Germany. The government did a lot of work to find and train athletes and coaches that they believed would do very well. This made it hard say that it was doping rather than very good performance that was the reason for them winning so much.

In 1990, the German reformed back into Germany. The "NOC of the GDR" joined the "NOC of Germany" on 17 November 1990. The German athletes took part in the Olympic Games in a single team again from 1992 forward. During the first decade after this, athletes from the Eastern part of Germany still won many of Germany's medals. This shows that doping was not the only reason East Germany did so well in the Olympics. It shows that their training conditions were also very important. As trainers and athletes started to move freely around the country, this difference between east and west became smaller.


Sonar

Sonar is a machine that uses underwater sound waves to find other objects in the sea. A sonar can work by sending out sound and listening for echoes (active sonar), like a radar, or by listening for sound made by the object it is trying to find (passive sonar). 

The basic parts of an active sonar are:

The first use of passive sonar was in 1490 by Leonardo da Vinci, when he put a tube onto water and listened. Active sonar was first used in 1917 by Paul Langevin. The word "SONAR" was created during the Second World War as an acronym for Sound Navigation and Ranging. This acronym replaced the British acronym ASDIC. The word is now thought by many people as a regular word, no longer as an acronym.

Rococo

Rococo is an artistic style which originated in the 18th century in France. Often referred to merely as Late Baroque, the Rococo developed from the Baroque artistic movement. Whilst it kept several characteristics of the original style, including elaboration and ornate themes, it was also more playful and asymmetrical. The Rococo is associated with the reign of French king Louis XV (Louis XIV is associated with the Baroque, whilst Louis XVI with Neoclassicism, albeit his style started off as Rococo at the beginning of reign). Rococo's popularity was at its height towards the middle of the 18th century, fading out by the end in favour of Neoclassicism.

Rococo art and architecture was feminine, graceful, florid and ornate. Creamy and pastel-like colours were used for paintings, unlike the darker shades in Baroque art. Religion and politics were no longer necessarily the core theme of Rococo art, unlike the Baroque, and everyday life became more commonly represented. In such a way, Rococo art revolved around themes such as love, romance, fun, landscapes, and mere portraits. Additionally, Far Eastern themes became popular in Rococo, especially Chinoiserie. Famous Rococo artists include Boucher, Watteau and Fragonard, amongst several others.

The Rococo has been the focus of much discussion, analysis and criticism by art historians throughout history. It has been criticised over the years for being over-the-top, superficial and frivolous; in such a way, the term has even been used derogatively in various points of history. Nevertheless, Rococo art and theatre has also received praise for the elegance, "beauty", and "charm" of its artwork.

Azerbaijani food

Azerbaijani food is what people cook and eat in Azerbaijan. Foods from different cultures have influenced Azerbaijani food. However, it remained different from foods in other countries. Many foods that started in Azerbaijan are now part of other cultures. For the Azerbaijanis, food is an important part of the country's culture and is very connected with the history, traditions and values of the nation.
Out of 11 climate types in the world, Azerbaijan has nine. This adds to the fertility of the soil, so there are many kinds of vegetables used according to seasons and the dishes. The climate helps to create the richness of the food. Fresh herbs, including mint, coriander, dill, basil, parsley, tarragon, leek, chive, thyme, marjoram, green onion and watercress, are very popular and are often put in the main dishes. The Caspian Sea has many edible species of fish, including the sturgeon, Caspian salmon, kutum, sardines, grey mullet, and others. Black caviar from the Caspian Sea is one of Azerbaijan’s best known delicacies wanted in many parts of the world.

The main courses of Azerbaijani cuisine are over 30 kinds of soups, including those prepared from plain yogurt. One of the most famous dishes is plov. Plov is a saffron-covered rice, served with different herbs. The Azerbaijani cuisine has more than 40 different plov recipes. Other second courses include many kinds of kebabs and shashliks, including lamb, beef, chicken, and fish ("baliq") kebabs. Sturgeon, a common fish, is normally skewered (skewer is a thin metal or wood stick used to hold pieces of food together) and grilled as a shashlik, being served with a tart pomegranate sauce called "narsharab". Dried fruits and walnuts are used in many dishes. The traditional condiments are salt, the spices black pepper, sumac, and especially saffron. Much of the saffron comes from the Absheron Peninsula.

Black tea is the national drink, and is drunk after food is eaten. It is also popular on its own or with dried fruits.

Another popular drink is sherbet, a sweet cold drink made of fruit juice mixed or boiled with sugar, often perfumed with rose water. Azerbaijani sherbet is not sorbet, the cold dessert.


Genji

The "nengō" "Genji" means "original rule". 






Kde domov můj?

"Kde domov můj" (, meaning "Where My Home is") is the national anthem of the Czech Republic. It was the national anthem of the former country of Czechoslovakia, combined with parts of the Slovak national anthem "Nad Tatrou sa blýska". It was created by Josef Kajetán Tyl and František Škroup in 1834, and was first published in the play "Fidlovačka aneb žádný hněv a žádná rvačka".

This version was translated into English by Czech poet Václav Sládek (1845–1912).

Between 1918 and 1938 there was an official version in German by Karl Wenzel Ernst.

Between the same years there was an official version in Hungarian.

Synchrotron

A synchrotron is a type of particle accelerator where particles travel around many times in a circle. It uses a magnetic field to turn the particles in the circle and an electric field to speed up the particles. The components are carefully matched up with the travelling particle beam so that the circle stays the same size while the particles go faster. Mark Oliphant invented the proton synchrotron. Vladimir Veksler was the first to publish the idea. Edwin McMillan constructed the first electron synchrotron.

The synchrotron is an improvement over the cyclotron where the particles travel in a spiral pattern. A cyclotron uses a constant magnetic field and a constant-frequency applied electric field. (One of these is varied in the synchrocyclotron). Both of these fields are varied in the synchrotron to change the path from a spiral to a circle. By carefully making the fields bigger as the particles gain energy, the width of the circular path can be kept the same as the machine accelerates the particles. This allows the vacuum chamber for the particles to be a large thin circular pipe torus (donut shape). It is easier to use some straight sections between the bending magnets and some bent sections within the magnets giving the torus the shape of a round-cornered polygon. A path that acts like a very large circle can be constructed using simple straight and curved pipe segments, unlike the disc-shaped chamber of the cyclotron type devices. The shape also requires the use of multiple magnets to bend the particle beams. Straight sections are required at spacings around a ring for both radiofrequency cavities, and in third generation setups space is allowed for insertion of energy extraction devices such as wigglers and undulators. Most synchrotrons use two types of magnets: dipole magnets to bend the particle beam and quadrupole magnets to focus the beam.

The maximum energy that a cyclic accelerator can impart is typically limited by the strength of the magnetic field(s) and the minimum radius (maximum curvature) of the particle path. So, over time, physicist have built accelerators with bigger magnets and larger circles to reach higher particle energy levels.
In a cyclotron, the maximum radius is quite limited as the particles start at the center and spiral outward. So, the entire path must be a self-supporting disc-shaped vacuum chamber. Since the radius is limited, the power of the machine becomes limited by the strength of the magnetic field. In the case of an ordinary electromagnet the field strength is limited by the saturation of the core (when all magnetic domains are lined up the same way, the field cannot not be further increased to any practical extent). The arrangement of the single pair of magnets the full width of the device also limits the economic size of the device.

Synchrotrons overcome these limits, using a narrow beam pipe which can be surrounded by much smaller and more tightly focusing magnets. 


Brave (2012 movie)

Brave is a 2012 American computer-animated fantasy-adventure movie which stars Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson. The movie was released on June 22, 2012, by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Pixar was the studio that worked on this movie. It received positive responses from critics and won an Oscar.

The movie is set in Scotland during the Medieval period. 16-year-old Princess causes chaos in the kingdom of DunBroch by not wanting to marry.

It took six years to make.


France at the Olympics

France has taken part in every Olympic Games with the possible exception of the 1904 Games. In 1904, different sources list Albert Corey as taking place in the games for either the United States or France.

The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for France is FRA.

France has hosted the Games 5 time:

French athletes have won 671 medals at the Summer Olympic Games. Fencing and cycling are their best sports. France has won 94 medals at the Winter Olympic Games. Most of these are in alpine skiing.

Jean-Honoré Fragonard

Jean-Honoré Fragonard (5 April 1732 in Grasse – 22 August 1806 in Paris) was a French artist. He is remembered as one of the most important French painters of the rococo style. He was a pupil of François Boucher, and developed Boucher's style further. At first he did historical paintings, but soon gave up on these.

He then painted things that were light-hearted, and slightly erotic. His works include "The Swing", "A Young Girl Reading", and "The Secret Meeting". Together with Boucher and Antoine Watteau, he is one of the principal painters of French Rococo. He lost his wealth during the French Revolution. After the revolution, the painting style was different, because he had trouble adapting, he died a poor man.

System of linear equations

In mathematics, a system of linear equations (or linear system) is a collection of linear equations involving the same set of variables.

Mathematicians show the relationship between different factors in the form of equations. "Linear equations" mean the variable appears only once in each equation without being raised to a power. A "system" of linear equations means that all of the equations are true at the same time. So, the person solving the system of equations is looking for the values of each variable that will make all of the equations true at the same time. If no such values can satisfy all of the equations in the system, then the equations are called "inconsistent."

For example,
is a system of three equations in the three variables formula_2, formula_3, formula_4. A "solution" to a linear system is a choice of numbers for each variable such that every equation is true at the same time. The following is a solution to the equation above: 
It works because it makes all three equations true:

In mathematics, the theory of linear systems is a branch of linear algebra, a subject which is fundamental to modern mathematics. Computer algorithms for finding the solutions are an important part of numerical linear algebra, and such methods play a prominent role in engineering, physics, chemistry, computer science, and economics. A system of non-linear equations can often be approximated by a linear system (see linearization), a helpful technique when making a mathematical model, computer model, or computer simulation of a relatively complex system. For complex systems, there are many equations and many variables, not just two or three. In many cases, the number of equations and variables in the system are the same. In some cases, there are more variables than equations, and the solution will be a range of different values rather than one exact solution.

The simplest kind of linear system involves two equations and two variables:
One method for solving such a system is as follows. First, solve the top equation for formula_2 in terms of formula_3:
Now substitute this expression for "x" into the bottom equation:
This results in a single equation involving only the variable formula_3. Solving gives formula_13, and substituting this back into the equation for formula_2 yields formula_15:
This method generalizes to systems with additional variables.

Very often, all the coefficients are written in the form of a matrix A, which is called a coefficient matrix.
In much the same way, the variables can be written in the form of a vector:
This makes it possible to write 
Mathematically, the vector defined above is a 1-by-n matrix. The system of equations can then be solved using the multiplication operation defined on matrices. A, x and b are all part of the same algebraic field.

There a three cases when looking for solutions to a system of linear equations:

There are two categories of methods for solving a system of linear equations. Iterative methods use many steps to get a solution, direct methods only need one step:
Examples for iterative methods are:

There are examples such as geodesy where there are many more measurements than unknowns. Such a system is almost always overdetermined and has no exact solution. Each measurement is usually inaccurate and includes some amount of error. Since the measurements are not exact, it is not possible to obtain an exact solution to the system of linear equations; methods such as Least squares can be used to compute a solution that best fits the overdetermined system. This least squares solution can often be used as a stand-in for an exact solution.

Solving a system of linear equations has a complexity of at most O (n). At least n operations are needed to solve a general system of n linear equations. The best algorithm known to date was developed by Don Coppersmith and Shmuel Winograd and dates from 1990. It has a complexity of n Unfortunately, it is of little practical use.

Using computers to solve systems of linear equations is used every day. For example, it is used in weather forecasting models. Hot dog factories use it to make small changes in the receipe as food ingredient prices change. College cafeterias use it to figure out how much food to cook based on past experience when the cafeteria gives students the choice between multiple entrees.




François Boucher

François Boucher (29 September 1703 in Paris - 30 May 1770) was a French painter, mostly known as one of the main artists of the French rococo movement. He painted several portraits of his patroness, Madame de Pompadour. He is also known for his open-minded voluptuous paintings.


Valdivia expedition

The Valdivia expedition was a scientific exedition to explore the Deep sea. It was a German expedition, done in 1898 and 1899. A ship was bought from "Hamburg-Amerikanischen Packetfahrt-Actien-Gesellschaft" HAPAG and given instruments to be able to perform scientific measurements. The ship left Hamburg on 31st July 1898 and returned on 1st May 1899. The ship had travelled over 32.000 nautical miles. The expedition was very successful. The results were published in 24 volumes; publishing them took until 1940. 

Spain at the Olympics

Spain first took part in the Olympic Games in 1900. It has sent athletes to compete in most Summer Olympic Games since 1920. Spain has taken part in every Winter Olympic Games since 1936.

Spain boycotted the 1936 Summer Olympics in Nazi Germany. They also boycotted the 1956 Games in Melbourne because of the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary. The equestrian events in 1956 took place five months earlier in Stockholm, and Spain did compete in those events.

Spain hosted the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Barcelona was the home city of the International Olympic Committee's president at the time, Juan Antonio Samaranch.

Spanish athletes have won a total of 132 medals. Sailing has given them their largest number of medals in one sport. Spain has only won two medals at the Winter Games.

The Spanish Olympic Committee ("Comité Olímpico Español") was created in 1924.



Croatia at the Olympics

Croatia took part in the Olympic Games for the first time as an its own nation in 1992. It has taken part in every Games since then. Before 1992, Croatian athletes competed for Yugoslavia at the Olympics.

The National Olympic Committee for Croatia is the Croatian Olympic Committee. It was created in 1991. The IOC accepted the committee in 1993.

Croatian athletes have won 23 medals at the Summer Olympic Games. They won gold medals by the men's handball team in 1996 and 2004. At the Winter Olympic Games, Janica Kostelić won six medals (four gold) between 2002 and 2006. Her brother Ivica won several silver medals (in 2006 and 2010). Jakov Fak won a bronze in 2010.



Cyprus at the Olympics

Cyprus (CYP) has sent athletes to every Olympic Games held since 1980.

Cyprus earned its first Olympic medal in the 2012 Summer Olympics. Pavlos Kontides earned a silver medal in the men's laser sailing event.

They almost won a medal in the 2008 Olympics when Antonis Nikolaidis lost the bronze medal shoot-off in men's skeet. The first athlete from Cyprus in the modern Olympics was Anastasios Andreou in 1896. He competed under the Greek flag. At this time, Cyprus was a British colony. The olympics does not recognise Northern Cyprus and Turkish Cypriots are unable to participate. 



Czech Republic at the Olympics

The Czech Republic first took part in the Olympic Games as an independent country in 1994. It has competed in every Summer Olympic Games and Winter Olympic Games since then. Before 1993, Czech athletes took part in the Olympics from 1920 to 1992 as Czechoslovakia and from 1900 to 1912 as Bohemia.

Athletes from the Czech Republic have won a total of 43 medals at the Summer Games. Canoeing, shooting and athletics have been their best sports. They have also won 16 medals at the Winter Games. Most of their medals came from the Czech Republic national ice hockey team and cross-country skier Kateřina Neumannová.

The National Olympic Committee for the Czech Republic is the Czech Olympic Committee. It was founded in 1899 and accepted by the International Olympic Committee in 1993.



Scaphognathus

Scaphognathus was a rhamphorhyncoid pterosaur found in the Solnhofen limestone of the Upper Jurassic. 

It had wings that was about one meter long and a long tail shaped like a leaf. The leaf-tail probably acted like a rudder, helping it steer through the air. It was probably a diurnal (daytime) flier, where "Rhamphorhynchus" was probably nocturnal.

Scaphognathus ate "Pholidophorus" fish. 

Czechoslovakia at the Olympics

Czechoslovakia in the Olympics is a history which includes 32 games in 20 countries and 2,000+ athletes. Since 1920, Nicaragua has contributed to the growth of the "Olympic Movement".

The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for Czechoslovakia was CZS. Czechoslovakia was peacefully separated into two nations in 1993. The Czech Republic is now is CZE and Slovakia is now SVK.

Czechoslovakia first took part in the Olympic Games in 1920. Before this, it competed as Bohemia from 1900 to 1912. The nation sent athletes to compete almost every Summer Olympic Games since then. They did not take part in the 1984 Games as part of the Soviet boycott of those Games.
Czechoslovakia has taken part in every Winter Olympic Games since the first Winter Games in 1924.

In 1993, Czechoslovakia was divided into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Each of these countries sent their own teams to the Olympics since 1994.

Czechoslovakian athletes have won a total of 143 medals at the Summer Games. Most of these medals were won in gymnastics. The nation also won 25 medals at the Winter Games. Ski jumping and ice hockey have been their best sports.

"This table of summer sports does not include the bronze medal won in ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics."

"This table includes the bronze medal won in Ice hockey in the 1920 Summer Olympics."


Denmark at the Olympics

Denmark at the Olympics is a history which includes 40 games in 22 countries and 1,800+ athletes. Since 1896, Denmark has contributed to the growth of the "Olympic Movement".

The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for Denmark is DEN.

Teams from Denmark have taken part in the Olympic Games since the very first games in 1896.

The National Olympic Committee for Denmark (National Olympic Committee and Sports Confederation of Denmark or "Danmarks Idræts-Forbund Olympisk Komite") was created in 1905; and it was recognized by the International Olympic Committee the same year.

Denmark has sent athletes to every Summer Olympic Games except for the 1904 Games.

Denmark has been a part of the Winter Olympic Games several times since 1948. They have been at every Games since 1988.

Danish athletes have won a total of 171 medals. Sailing is their best medal winning sport.

Denmark has won only one medal at the Winter Games. This was in curling at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano



Drug cartel

The term drug cartel is used to describe a group who makes, distributes and sells illegal drugs on a national level. Drug cartels are often doing so across multiple countries. Mostly, the cartels in areas like Mexico and South America bring drugs to North America.

The basic structure of a drug cartel is the following:


There are other members in drug cartels, typically those who are drug planters and suppliers. They are critical parts of a drug cartels operation. They are technically not considered part of the logistics in drug cartels.


Estonia at the Olympics

Estonia first competed in the Olympic Games at the 1920 Summer Olympics after becoming independence from Russia in 1918. The National Olympic Committee was created in 1923. They were a part of the first Winter Olympics in 1924. Estonian athletes took part of the Olympic Games until the country became a part of the Soviet Union in 1940. In the 1980 Summer Olympics, the Sailing regatta was held in the capital city of Tallinn. Estonia has taken part in all Olympics since it became independent again in 1991. Estonia has won most of its medals in athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and cross-country skiing.



Neo-Keynesian economics

Neo-Keynesian economics is a school of macroeconomic thought that was developed after World War II from the writings of John Maynard Keynes. A group of economists (notably John Hicks, Franco Modigliani, and Paul Samuelson), attempted to interpret and formalize Keynes' writings, and to synthesize it with the neo-classical models of economics. This model, the IS/LM model, is nearly as influential as Keynes' original analysis in determining actual policy and economics education. It relates aggregate demand and employment to three variables, that is, the amount of money in circulation, the government budget, and the state of business expectations. This model was very popular with economists after World War II because it could be understood in terms of general equilibrium theory. Their work has become known as the neo-classical synthesis. It created the models that formed the core ideas of neo-Keynesian economics. These ideas dominated mainstream economics in the post-war period, and formed the mainstream of macroeconomic thought in the 1950s, 60s and 70s.

In the 1970s a series of developments occurred that shook neo-Keynesian theory. The developed world suffered from slow economic growth and high inflation at the same time (stagflation). The work of monetarists like Milton Friedman cast doubt on neo-Keynesian theories. The result was a series of new ideas to bring tools to Keynesian analysis that would be capable of explaining the economic events of the 1970s. The next great wave of Keynesian thinking began with the attempt to give Keynesian macroeconomic reasoning a microeconomic basis. The new Keynesians helped create a "new neo-classical synthesis" that currently forms the mainstream of macroeconomic theory. Following the emergence of the new Keynesian school, neo-Keynesians have sometimes been referred to as Old-Keynesians.

Pinetop Smith

Clarence Smith, better known as Pinetop Smith or Pine Top Smith (June 11, 1904 – March 15, 1929) was an American boogie-woogie style blues pianist. His hit tune, "Pine Top's Boogie Woogie," featured rhythmic "breaks" that were an essential ingredient of ragtime music.

In 1991, he was added to the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame.


Sea wall

A sea wall is a wall built to protect land along the coast from erosion and flooding from the sea. While they do provide protection from the waves and tides, a sea wall may also create more problems. Erosion of beach sand may increase because of the wall, and the wall may change the direction and flow of waves and caused erosion in other places.

Unity Broadcasting Network

The Unity Broadcasting Network is an over-the-air religious television network. The office of the company is in Booneville, Mississippi, and individual transmitter stations are located in Mississippi and Tennessee.


UBN's website says that their Booneville Channel 34 programs are carried on Comcast Cable channel 8 in Corinth, MS, and their MySpace account says they are on Comcast Cable channel 56.

Polar night

The polar night is when it stays dark outside for more than twenty four hours. This occurs only inside the polar circles (the northernmost and southernmost areas on Earth). A lot of times It will be a polar night for the winter and the opposite happens in the summer.


Succession to the Japanese throne

The line of succession to the Japanese throne is the list of people who may become Emperor of Japan.

In 2019, the current order of succession is clear. 

Emperor Naruhito has one daughter, Princess Aiko. Prince Akishino currently has two daughters (Princess Mako and Princess Kako) and one son (Prince Hisahito).



Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art

The Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art ("The Johnson Museum") is an art museum in Ithaca, New York. It is in the Arts Quad on the main campus of Cornell University. It is best known for its unusual concrete facade. The museum has more than 32,000 pieces of art. Each year, over 80,000 people go to the museum. It shows over 20 special exhibitions each year.
Cornell president Deane Waldo Malott started the University Art Museum in 1953. The A. D. White House was changed to hold Cornell's art collections. The current museum was built in 1973. It is named after Herbert Fisk Johnson, Jr.. Johnson was head of S.C. Johnson & Sons of Racine, Wisconsin ("Johnson Wax"). He was a former member of the university's Board of Trustees. He graduated in 1922. His son also served as a trustee.

The Johnson Museum of Art was designed by architect I.M. Pei. Many people say it looks like a sewing machine from the side. Its fifth floor bridges over the open aired sculpture garden. It was made so that it would not block the view of Cayuga Lake. It has a very good view of the lake from its north and west sides. It also has a room for meetings on the sixth floor. This room was used for many years by Cornell's Board of Trustees.

The location of the museum caused many architectural problems. There was a limited amount of space to build. Also, the building could not have a large affect on the view of the lake or the Arts Quad. It is also located on the knoll where tradition said Ezra Cornell chose the site for his university, at the north end of the Stone Row of Morrill, McGraw, and White Halls. The design wanted to visually anchor the north end of Library Slope. The final design was a narrow tower and a bridge. Critics have said it looks like a giant sewing machine.

One part of the design, which was never built, was an underground Asian art gallery. It would have included windows that opened into the Southern face of Fall Creek Gorge.

The building was awarded the American Institute of Architects Honor Award in 1975. The building's design was used on the cover of "Scientific American" as an early example of computer graphics.

In 2011, a new wing opened to help hold the museum's increasing collection. The new part mirrored the plans drawn up by Pei Cobb Freed & Partners. The architect in charge was John L. Sullivan III. He graduated Cornell in 1962. The project cost $22 million. This included some changes to the main building. The money for the project came from large grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Kresge Foundation. The Asian art storage area was moved from the center of the fifth floor to the lower level of the section. This allows them to make the public gallery space on the fifth floor larger. Galleries in the new wing will be used to show contemporary art. The upper level of the new section includes an outdoor Japanese garden. The plans wanted a tunnel under Campus Road to be added. It would have gone through the wall of the Fall Creek gorge. This was not done because of environmental issues.

The permanent collection has more than 32,000 works of art. Most notable is the George and Mary Rockwell Asian Art collection. There are also a large number of works by American artists. These artist include Stuart Davis and Robert Rauschenberg. There is also many works by members of the Hudson River School and the American Impressionists to contemporary art. The Collection of Prints, Drawings, and Photographs has more than 15,000 works. These include works by Berenice Abbott, Robert Frank, Alfred Stieglitz, and Garry Winogrand. The fifth floor observation level holds the museum's large Asian collection. The permanent collection also includes works from Africa, pre-Columbian America, and Oceania. It range from ancient to contemporary societies. Its collection has two windows from Frank Lloyd Wright's Darwin D. Martin House.

Classes for credit are taught by Cornell's academic departments, not by the museum. The museum does work with the teachers. It has gallery sessions for some classes. It also has gallery tours and course-related exhibitions that are run by the faculty. The museum also hosts thematic tours for local school student field trips. Over 7,000 schoolchildren go to the museum each year. The Johnson Museum Club is a Cornell student group that promotes student awareness of the Johnson Museum's collections, exhibitions, and resources. It hosts concerts, scavenger hunts and other events.


Succession to the Danish throne

The line of succession to the Danish throne is the list of people who may become King or Queen of Denmark.

Since 2009, Danish law identifies the eldest child of a Danish monarch the royal heir. The first-born child follows his or her parent on the throne. This is known as full or equal primogeniture.

In 2023, the current order of succession is clear.


The consent to Princess Benedikte's marriage to Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg in 1968 was given on the condition that their children (and further descendants) would have to take up permanent residence in Denmark during the age of mandatory education if they were to retain their succession rights. Since the condition was not met, Princess Benedikte's children are not deemed to have succession rights and are not included in the official line of succession. It is unclear whether their own descendants will have succession rights if residing in Denmark during the age of mandatory education. One Danish constitutional scholar, the late Professor Henrik Zahle, claimed that the children of Princess Benedikte do have succession rights, but without providing any arguments for the claim.



Order of succession

The order of succession is a sequence of people and events in a specific order. It may mean the passing of royal or other powers, such as in a dynasty.

The "order of succession" may be used in a historical way such as in a list of former leaders. Also, the phrase may mean the plan for how a leader takes over from another because of death, resignation, or removal.

Succession becomes a chronology that has developed during time which has passed like a list of popes or a list of emperors of Japan.

Succession histories are unique but not always obvious For example, Charles IX of Sweden (1604–1611) was only the third Swedish king named Charles.

Pope Francis is the 266th pope of the Roman Catholic Church. Saint Peter is listed as the first one.

Across the span of centuries, there have been problems with the list and the order of succession after St. Peter. For example: During the Western schism in the 14th century, there was more than one pope at the same time. Each had notable international support. Only some of then are included on the chronology of today's list.
European leaders then had to choose to support one pope or the other. 

Naruhito is the 126th Emperor of Japan. Emperor Jimmu is listed as the first one.

The list and the order of succession after Jimmu is not clear. For example, during the Nanboku-chō period in the 14th century, there was more than one emperor at the same time, and each had notable support. Only some of them some are included in today's list.

For 500 years, the Imperial chronology included Emperor Kōgon, Emperor Kōmyō, Emperor Sukō, Emperor Go-Kōgon and Emperor Go-En'yū. In the 19th century, those men were removed from the list. At the same time, Emperor Go-Murakami, Emperor Chōkei and Emperor Go-Kameyama were added.

The "order of succession" or "line of succession" is a formal plan to determine who inherits a future role or a position in a hierarchy after a death or another cause creates a vacancy or an opportunity for succession.

Many countries have developed formal succession planning. In contrast, Kim Jong-il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea selected his youngest son as the "Dear Successor" or "Great Successor". The process that led to his choice is not known.

In some countries, including Sweden since 1980, the Netherlands since 1983, Norway since 1990, Belgium since 1991, Denmark since 2009, and the United Kingdom since 2015, the oldest child of a monarch is expected to become the next monarch. That is known as "full" or "equal" as primogeniture.

In many countries including Spain and Japan, special preference is given to male children. That is known as "male primogeniture."

In the United States, the line of succession is explained in the "Presidential Succession Act of 1947". If the US President cannot fullfil his duties, the Vice President is expected to take his place, and the House Speaker is next.

Synchrotron light source

A synchrotron light source is a source of electromagnetic radiation produced by a synchrotron. The radiation can be artificially produced for scientific and technical purposes by specialized particle accelerators, typically by accelerating electrons. Once the high-energy electron beam has been generated, it is directed into auxiliary components such as bending magnets and insertion devices (undulators or wigglers) in storage rings and free-electron lasers. These supply the strong magnetic fields perpendicular to the beam which are needed to convert the high-energy electron energy into light or some other form of electronmagnetic radiation.

Synchrotron radiation may occur in accelerators either as a nuisance in particle physics experiments, or on purpose for many laboratory uses. Electrons are accelerated to high speeds in several stages to achieve a final energy that can be in the GeV range. In the Large Hadron Collider, proton bunches also produce the radiation at increasing amplitude and frequency as they accelerate in the vacuum field, making photoelectrons. The photoelectrons then make secondary electrons from the pipe walls with increasing frequency and density up to 7x10. Each proton may lose 6.7keV per turn due to this phenomenon. So, both electron synchrotrons and proton synchrotrons can be a light source.

The major applications of synchrotron light are in condensed matter physics, materials science, biology and medicine. Many experiments using synchrotron light probe the structure of matter from the sub-nanometer level of electronic structure to the micrometer and millimeter level. This is important in medical imaging. An example of a practical industrial application is the manufacturing of microstructures by the Lithography, Electroplating, and Molding (LIGA) process.


Succession to the Swedish throne

The line of succession to the Swedish throne is the list of people who may become Queen or King of Sweden.

Since 1980, Swedish law identifies the eldest child of a Swedish monarch the royal heir. The first-born child follows his or her parent on the throne. This is known as full or equal primogeniture.

The current order of succession is


Succession to the Dutch throne

The line of succession to the Dutch throne is the list of people who may become King or Queen of the Netherlands.

Since 1983, Dutch law identifies the eldest child of a Dutch monarch as the royal heir. The first-born child follows his or her parent on the throne. This is known as full or equal primogeniture.


Hawker

A hawker is a person who sells things that can be easily moved from place to place. They are also known as peddlers, costermongers, or street vendors. Hawkers often sells food items,various types of toys for kids,jewellery for girls and women. They attract attention by calling out, singing chants, and interacting loudly with 
customers. While hawkers can be found in markets, they often move their products from place to place in small carts. In 19th century Australia, the hawkers travelled around to distant towns and remote farms, carrying a large range of items to sell in horse drawn wagons.

Disc-detainer lock

A disc-detainer lock, also called a disc-tumbler, Abloy lock, or simply disc lock is a high-security keyed lock that uses a set of discs similar to those used in a combination lock. The difference is that the discs are rotated by a key instead of a dial.

When the key is put into the lock, it rotates a set of discs with notches on them to different positions depending on the depth of the cuts in the key. The right key will line up a set of notches in a straight line, allowing a bar to fall into the notches, opening the lock. The wrong key will not put the notches in a straight line, and the bar will not fall, preventing the lock from opening. On high-end disc-detainer locks (such as Abloy), there are usually "false" notches on the disc as well. These feel like the real notch to someone trying to pick the lock, but do not allow the bar to fall. This makes it nearly impossible to pick the lock. It is possible to pick some lower-end disc-detainer locks. The disc-detainer mechanism usually does not contain any springs. This reduces the amount of wear on the cylinder.

Ecological succession

Ecological succession, is how a specific ecology changes after a disturbance like a fire. In long-term studies, there is a species succession process in the way forests develop. 

Several scientists are prominent in the history of this theory:

Burrel, Albania

Burrel is a small town in Albania. It is 91 km from Tirana. Its population is about 18,000. It is about 320 metres above sea level, and surrounded by mountains.

The area was settled about the 8th century BC by the Illyrians. There have been 54 Illyrian burial mounds found around Burrel. The town of Burrel began in 1922 as the centre of the Mat District.

Black powder rocket motor

A black powder rocket motor pushes a model rocket using black powder. Black powder in the rockets is made of charcoal, sulphur, and potassium nitrate. The amount of each part can be changed to change how fast the black powder burns. The black powder burns very fast. The hot gases move fast as they leave the back of the rocket. This pushes the rocket forward.

Black powder rocket motors were made in a simple form by the Chinese. They were first written about in the early 13th century. The rocket motors have gotten better over the years. They have several uses. Some can be used as weapons. Some have cameras to take pictures from a height to get information. Some are also used just for fun.

Black powder rocket motors are only made in small sizes. If they are bigger there is a bigger chance of exploding. They also do not perform as well if they are bigger. They are made in different sizes called classes. The classes are 1/4 A through E. If the motor needs to be bigger than this, a different type of fuel is used. This is called a composite fuel. Some examples of composite fuels are ammonium perchlorate or ammonium nitrate.

Black powder is the oldest type of mixed rocket fuel. It was used in rockets even before it was used in guns. The three main parts of black powder are charcoal, sulphur, and saltpetre (or potassium nitrate). The Chinese were making black powder as early as 1045, which is about 1000 years ago. In the early thirteenth century (about 800 years ago) the Chinese turned black powder into a way to power weapons. Before that it was only used for fun. The first recorded use of rockets as military weapons was in 1232. The Chinese ‘arrows of fire’ were fired from a sort of catapult. The black powder was packed in a closed tube that had a hole in one end for escaping hot gases. The tube was mounted on a long stick so it was more balanced.

Black powder had a very low specific impulse. The way rockets were made got more advanced, but only on paper. People had not really built a much better rocket yet. They only had ideas and sketches of better models. In 1591 a Belgian, Jean Beavie, wrote about and drew the important idea of rockets that had more than one stage. This is called Multistaging. This means that the fuel is burned through in more than one step. This is the answer to escaping earth’s gravity and going into space.

By 1600, rockets were being used in some parts of Europe. They were used against cavalry, which is a group of fighting soldiers on horseback. By 1688, rockets weighing over 120 pounds had been built and fired in Germany. These German rockets could carry 16-pound warheads.

During the late 1700s, a London lawyer, Sir William Congreve, wanted to try to make rockets better. He did many experiments with different fuels and cases. His experiments were careful and orderly. He improved how far rockets could go, how stable they were, and how accurate they were. The British army used Congreve's new rockets to help them in the Napoleonic wars.

In 1939 researchers at the California Institute of Technology were trying to make a motor to help launch aircraft. They mixed black powder with common road asphalt to make the first composite motor. This was the beginning of the composite motor. It also ended the use of black powder for big rockets.

Black powder rocket propellant is a lot like old fashioned gunpowder. It has one different part called a binder. The binder is usually a substance called Dextrin. One common model rocket engine company is Estes Industries. Their motors are made with black powder propellant. Black powder propellant must be pressed very tightly to work well. If it is not packed tightly, it will burn too fast and might explode. A simple way of combining the parts to make black powder rocket propellant is: 75% potassium nitrate, 10% sulphur, and 15% charcoal. This is the most common way of making it. Dextrin may be added as a binder (usually between 0 and 5%). Extra (coarse) charcoal or metal powders (5 - 10%) may be added to make a spark trail. Adding these extras might change how fast the fuel burns.

Thrust is how hard of a push the rocket produces. Burn time is how long the fuel in the motor takes to burn while pushing gases out of the back of the rocket. The impulse of a rocket motor is the area under the thrust-time curve. This means the impulse is a number for how much force the rocket makes and for how long. The impulse of a black powder motor is used to tell what size class it is in. Motors are divided into classes from 1/4A to E. These classes hold rockets with impulses from 0 to 40 Ns (Newtons*seconds). Other kinds of model rocket motors can be named up to an ‘H’, which is up to 320 Ns.

Figures from tests of Estes rocket motors are used in the following examples of rocket motor performance.

For miniature black powder rocket motors (13 mm diameter), the maximum thrust is between 5 and 12 N, the total impulse is between .5 and 2.2 Ns, and the burn time is between .25 and 1 second. For Estes ‘regular size’ rocket motors (18 mm diameter), there are three classes: A, B, and C. The A class 18 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 9.5 and 9.75 N, a total impulse between 2.1 and 2.3 Ns, and a burn time between .5 and .75 seconds. The B class 18 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 12.15 and 12.75 N, a total impulse between 4.2 and 4.35 Ns, and a burn time between .85 and 1 second. The C class 18mm motors have a maximum thrust from 14 – 14.15 N, a total impulse between 8.8 and 9 Ns, and a burn time between 1.85 and 2 seconds.

There are also 3 classes included in Estes large (24 mm diameter) rocket motors: C, D, and E. The C class 24 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 21.6 and 21.75 N, a total impulse of between 8.8 and 9 Ns, and a burn time between .8 and .85 seconds. The D class 24 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 29.7 and 29.8 N, a total impulse between 16.7 and 16.85 Ns, and a burn time between 1.6 and 1.7 seconds. The E class 24 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 19.4 and 19.5 N, a total impulse between 28.45 and 28.6 Ns, and a burn time between 3 and 3.1 seconds.


Succession to the Belgian throne

The line of succession to the Belgian throne is the list of people who may become King or Queen of Belgium.

The death of King Baudouin in 1993 caused a short period of uncertainty about the succession. Prince Philippe was the expected to be the next king; but Baudouin's brother Albert became the new monarch.

Since 2009, Belgian law identifies the eldest child of a Belgian monarch the royal heir. The first-born child follows his or her parent on the throne. This is known as full or equal primogeniture.

In 2013, Albert abdicated for health reasons and his son Philippe became the King.




Succession to the Norwegian throne

The line of succession to the Norwegian throne is the list of people who may become King or Queen of Norway.

Bogan River

The Bogan River is an inland river of New South Wales, Australia. It begins at Goonumbla, near Parkes. It flows in a north west direction for about before it joins the Darling River near Bourke. The towns of Tottenham, Peak Hill and Nyngan are built on the banks of the Bogan River.

The first European to see the Bogan River was Charles Sturt in 1828-9. He named it New Year Creek. However the Indigenous Australian name, Bogan, which means birthplace of a king, was the name that was used. The explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell created a painting in 1836 of an Aboriginal man, Combo, from the Bogan River.

At Peak Hill, the local weir is built on Aboriginal stone fishing traps, similar to those in Brewarrina. 

Castlereagh River

The Castlereagh River is an inland river in New South Wales, Australia. It begins in the Warrumbungles, a mountain range, and flows east towards Coonabarabran. It turns to the south, and then flows north west through Gilgandra and Coonamble, before joining the Macquarie River. The length of the river is about .

The first Europen to see the Castlereagh River was George William Evans in 1818 during John Oxley's expedition. It was later explored by Charles Sturt in 1829. The river is named after Lord Castlereagh, a British politician who was the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

Switzerland at the Olympics

Switzerland has sent athletes to every Olympic Games since the first Games in 1896.

Emperor Go-Toba

This 12th century sovereign was named after Emperor Toba and means "later". He is sometimes called the later Emperor Toba. In some older sources, this emperor may be identified as "Toba the Second" or as "Toba II".

Before he became the monarch, his personal name ("imina") was , or Takanari"-shinnō"

He was the fourth son of Emperor Takakura.

Go-Toba was placed on the throne at the age of three.

Go-Toba was buried on Dōgo Island in the Oki Islands group. Later a part of his body was re-buried in Kyoto.

According to the Imperial Household Agency, the mausoleum ("misasagi") of Go-Toba is in Kyoto. The emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine at "Ōhara no Misasagi".

The years of Go-Toba's reign are marked by more than one era name:.


Toys &quot;R&quot; Us

Toys "R" Us is an American toy, clothing, and baby product company. It is owned by Tru Kids, Inc. (as Tru Kids Brands) and others. The company was founded in 1957. Its first store was built in April 1948. The headquarters of the company is in Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey. It is in the New York metropolitan area.

At one time, Toys'R'Us was the most important toy store. killer, The rise of mass merchants and online sellers cost Toys "R" Us its comtrol of the toy market. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and 2018. It closed all of its stores in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia. The last US stores closed in 2021. In other international markets such as Asia and Africa there were less negative effects. Stores in Canada, parts of Europe and Asia were sold to other companies.

In August 2021, WHP Global said that Toys "R" Us would be opening over 400 stores inside Macy's stores. They would start doing this in 2022. In December 2021, WHP announced they will be opening a Toys “R” Us location in New Jersey at the American Dream Mall.

On March 22, 2018, the founder of the company, Charles Lazarus, died at age 94 years.

Lake Blanche

Lake Blanche is a large salt lake in the north east corner of South Australia. It is normally dry, but can be filled by local flooding or when the Strzelecki Creek flows into it. It covers an area of about . When Lake Blanche was first seen by the explorer Edward John Eyre in 1840, he believed it was part of a large horse shoe shaped lake at the end of the Flinders Ranges. This lake stopped the explorers from being able to travel any further to the north. When Charles Sturt visited the lake shore in 1845 he also thought it was part of a larger lake. In 1858 the explorer Augustus Charles Gregory was the first European to find a path between Lake Blanche and Lake Callabonna. Lake Blanche was named after the wife of the Governor of South Australia, Sir Richard Graves McDonnell. The area near the lake had been called Blanchewater Plains by explorer Benjamin Herschel Babbage in 1856. In August 1857, Captain Freeling attempted to explore the flooded lake by boat. The water was not deep enough to float the boat, and even after walking more than into the lake it was still only ankle deep.

The area around Lake Blanche is now being explored for development of a uranium mine.

Bronchiolitis

Bronchiolitis is a medical condition where the smaller parts of the lung (called bronchioles) are irritated. This makes it very hard to move air in and out of the lungs. Many things can cause bronchiolitis. The most common is the respiratory syncytial virus. The disease Bronchiolitis is not the same as Bronchitis. The medicine used to treat bronchitis may not be the same as those used to treat bronchiolitis. The disease is more common in children.

Usually treatment for bronchiolitis is to make the person as comfortable as possible. This can sometimes be giving them oxygen through tubes sitting on their nose ("nasal cannula"). A doctor may also use medicines such as epinephrine or dexamethasone.

Respiratory syncytial virus

Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a virus that causes lung infections,(usually called respiratory tract infections). It is the major cause of lung infections and hospital visits in babies and children. There is a medicine that can help prevent the virus in babies that have not been born yet if the doctor is worried the baby may get the virus.

Lake Alexandrina

Lake Alexandrina is a large lake about south east of Adelaide, South Australia. The lake covers an area of . The Murray River flows into the north of the lake near Wellington. Water from the lake enters the sea through an opening into Encounter Bay. In 1940 a number of walls were built to stop sea water from flowing back into the lake which would stop the lake from being salty. These walls separate the lake from the Murray River's estuary lagoon, called the Coorong.

Lake Alexandrina and the Coorong are a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Many bird species live around the lake including Curlew Sandpiper, Banded Stilt, Red-capped Plover, Masked Lapwing, Redkneed Dotterel, Black Swan, Cape Barren Goose, Musk Duck, Straw-necked Ibis, Royal Spoonbill, Rufus Night Heron and the Australian Pelican. Rare species such as the Orange Bellied Parrot and the Southern Mount Lofty Ranges Emu Wren have been seen. The large Murray Cod can also be found in the lake.

The Ngarrindjeri, an Indigenous Australian people, have lived around the lake and the wetlands for thousands of years. The first Europens to find the lake were people hunting seals along the south east coast of Australia in 1828. In 1830, the explorer Charles Sturt reached the lake by boat after a long journey down the Murrumbidgee, the Darling and the Murray Rivers. Sturt named the lake after Princess Alexandrina, who later became Queen Victoria.

Lake Alexandina became important during the 1870s when paddle steamers began to use the Murray River system to carry goods around New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. The town of Milang, on the lake, became an important port. It is now popular as a place for holidays with activities including sailing, power boating, fishing and swimming.

Béla Guttmann

Béla Guttmann (27 January 1899 – 28 August 1981) was a Hungarian footballer and coach of Jewish origin. His playing position was midfielder.

He started his career with the MTK Hungária FC team of the early 1920s. He won the championship in 1920 and 1921. In 1922 he went to Vienna to escape the antisemitism of the Hungarian regime. There he played for SC Hakoah Wien. In 1925 he won another league title when Hakoah won the Austrian League. In April 1926 the SC Hakoah Wien team sailed to New York to play against different American teams. He stayed in the USA and played for the Brooklyn Wanderers, New York Giants, New York Hakoah, New York Soccer Club and the Hakoah All-Stars.

As player he had 6 matches with the Hungarian national football team and scored one goal there.
Guttmann returned to Europe in 1932. He coached teams in Austria, The Netherlands and Hungary . (SC Hakoah Wien, SC Enschede) He had his first success with Újpest FC in the 1938–39 season. He won the Hungarian League and the Mitropa Cup. How Guttman spent the war years in unclear. Guttmann himself is said to have escaped to Switzerland where he was interned. The years after the Second World War he spent as coach in Italy, South America and Portugal.(São Paulo FC, AC Milan, Benfica Lisabon and others).

Together with Márton Bukovi and Gusztáv Sebes, Guttmann formed a triumvirate of Hungarian coaches who pioneered the 4–2–4 formation. Guttman is also credited with mentoring Eusébio. He was as player and coach always good for controversy. Some people compare his self-confidence with José Mourinho.

Emperor Fushimi

Emperor Fushimi (伏見天皇 "Fushimi-tennō") (10 May 1265 – 8 October 1317) was the 92nd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. His reign started in 1287 and ended in 1298.

Before he became the monarch, this prince's personal name ("imina") was .

Prince Hirohito was the second son of Emperor Go-Fukakusa.

Hirohito"-shinnō" was named Crown Prince. He became heir to Emperor Go-Uda.

According to the Imperial Household Agency, the mausoleum ("misasagi") of Kammu is in Kyoto. The emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine at "Fukakusa no kita no misasagi" (深草北陵) in Fushimi-ku in Kyoto.

The years of Fushimi's reign are marked by more than one era name.


Rodney King

Rodney Glen King (April 2, 1965 - June 17, 2012) was an African-American man who was beat up by police officers on camera in 1991. When a jury did not find the officers guilty of beating him up, large riots started in Los Angeles, California.

King was born in Sacramento, California to Odessa and Ronald King, who had four other children. His father was an alcoholic who died in 1984 aged 42. King grew up in Altadena, California.

In November 1989, King robbed a store in Monterey Park, California. King was carrying an iron bar, which he threatened the Korean store owner with. He hit the owner and stole $200. He was convicted of robbery and sentenced to two years imprisonment. He was released after a year.

On March 3, 1991, King was driving after drinking alcohol. Police officers tried to pull him over, but King would not stop. The officers chased him for miles. King finally stopped. One of the officers shot two electronic darts at King because they thought he might hurt them. King ran at one of the officers. The officers beat King while he was on the ground with a baton more than 50 times.

A man named George Holliday, who lived nearby, saw what was going on. He used a camcorder to record a video of the beating. The video later went on television.

Of the four officers that went on trial for beating King, only one of them was found guilty by the state of California. With large public protest, rioting began in Los Angeles, during which more than 50 people were killed, thousands were hurt, and one billion dollars worth of property damage occurred.

In a different trial, the United States government later found two of the officers guilty.

King was found dead by his fiancée at the bottom of his swimming pool in the early morning hours of June 17, 2012 in Rialto, California. An autopsy was performed and the results said that King died of accidental drowning and that alcohol, cocaine, and marijuana were all found in his blood which were a contributing factor in his death.

Tung Chung Line (MTR)

The Tung Chung Line is one of the 10 lines of the MTR system in Hong Kong. It links Tung Chung with Hong Kong Island. A part of the Tung Chung Line was built along with the two bridges and two mountains, Kap Shui Mun Bridge and the Tsing Ma Bridge. It currently travels through eight stations in 27 minutes along its route, which is indicated in orange.

Wiggler (synchrotron)

A wiggler is an insertion device in a synchrotron. It is a series of magnets designed to repeatedly laterally deflect ('wiggle') a beam of charged particles inside a storage ring of a synchrotron. These deflections release synchrotron radiation. Although synchrotrons give off such radiation anyway as magnets work to bend the particles on a circle-like path, a wiggler release more intense radiation than the bending magnets.

A wiggler has a broader spectrum of radiation than an undulator. In a wiggler, the period and the strength of the magnetic field is not tuned to the frequency of radiation produced by the electrons. So, every electron in the electron bunch radiates independently. This makes a broad radiation spectrum. A wiggler can be considered to be series of bending magnets stuck together, and its radiation intensity goes up as the number of magnetic poles in the wiggler goes up.

Typically the magnets in a wiggler are arranged in a Halbach array. The design shown above is usually known as a Halbach wiggler.

Gold coin

A gold coin is a coin made entirely (or almost entirely) of gold. Gold has been used since the invention of coins. It is used because gold is an easy metal to use, and because gold is very valuable. So, a person could have a small quantity of gold coins but still buy many things. Gold is also a very dense metal, making gold coins hard to fake. Gold is good for storing coins because it does not rust.

People have used gold to trade since the Bronze Age. However, gold coins have only existed since the 6th century BC, in Anatolia (Turkey) then in Roman Empire ("aureus"). Gold coins were also used in China.
In the Middle Ages, gold coins were common because of the Florin and the Guilder, two important gold coins.

Between 1873 and the early 1900s, gold coins were the main way to pay. Countries stopped using gold coins in 1933 because of the Great Depression. People were collecting and keeping the coins, so there were not enough for the economy to work. Today, many countries make gold coins, but they are for collectors.

Many people enjoy collecting coins. The rarest (most rare) coins are the most expensive. Usually, very few of these coins were made, or they have mistakes, or they are very old. Some countries have made very large coins for collectors.

When people want to buy gold as a way to store money, they can buy gold coins. These coins are called "Bullion coins". These coins are usually very pure and have exact weights, for example one troy ounce. Many people who buy bullion coins hope they become more expensive in the future so they can be sold.

Bournville

Bournville is a model village on the south side of Birmingham, England, best known for its connections with the Cadbury family and chocolate – including a dark chocolate bar called "Bournville". It is also a ward within the council constituency of Selly Oak and home to the Bournville Centre for Visual Arts. Research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has claimed that it is "one of the nicest places to live in Britain".

Originally the area that was to become Bournville consisted of a few scattered farmsteads and cottages, linked by winding country lanes, with the only visual highlight being the Georgian built Bournbrook Hall.

The bluebell glades of Stocks Wood were said to be a relic of the Forest of Arden and there are Roman remains nearby.

Having taken over their father John Cadbury's expanding business in 1861, the Quakers George and Richard Cadbury needed to move their cocoa and chocolate factory from Bridge Street in central Birmingham to a greenfield site to allow for expansion.

Cadbury were reliant on the canals for milk delivery, and on the railways for cocoa deliveries from the ports of London and Southampton. They therefore need a site which was undeveloped and had easy access to both canal and rail. The brothers noticed the proposed development of the Birmingham West Suburban Railway, which would extend from central Birmingham south along the path of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal into the then green fields of southern Birmingham and the villages of northern Worcestershire.

In 1879, they moved their business to Bournbrook Hall, to the south of Birmingham. The location was chosen as it was regarded as cleaner, healthier and more amenable to longer-term expansion plans. Although rural, it was also already serviced by the new Stirchley Street railway station, which itself was located right next to the canal.

The Cadburys named the area 'Bournville' after the Bourn Brook (now known as The Bourn); with 'ville' being French for 'town', this set Bournville apart from the local area (some people wrongly believe Bournville was originally known as Bournbrook - Bournbrook exists as a separate area to the north of Bournville). Then Cadburys began to develop their factory in the new suburb. Loyal and hard-working workers were treated with great respect and relatively high wages and good working conditions; Cadbury also pioneered pension schemes, joint works committees and a full staff medical service.

In 1893, George Cadbury bought 120 acres (0.5 km²) of land close to the works and planned, at his own expense, a model village which would 'alleviate the evils of modern more cramped living conditions'. By 1900, the estate included 313 cottages and houses set on of land, and many more similar properties were built in the years leading up to the World War I, with smaller developments taking place later on in the 20th century. These almost 'Arts and crafts' houses were traditional in design but with large gardens and modern interiors, and were designed by the resident architect William Alexander Harvey. These designs became a blueprint for many other model village estates around Britain. It is also noteworthy that, because George Cadbury was a temperance Quaker, no public houses have ever been built in Bournville although, since the late 1940s, there has been a licensed members' bar at Rowheath Pavilion.
The Cadburys were particularly concerned with the health and fitness of their workforce, incorporating park and recreation areas into the Bournville village plans and encouraging swimming, walking and indeed all forms of outdoor sports. In the early 1920s, extensive open lands were purchased at Rowheath and laid to football and hockey pitches together with a grassed running track. Rowheath Pavilion was designed and built in accordance with the instructions of George Cadbury and opened in July 1924. At that time, it served as the clubhouse and changing rooms for the acres of sports playing fields, several bowling greens, a fishing lake and an outdoor swimming lido, a natural mineral spring forming the source for the lido's healthy waters. The Rowheath Pavilion itself, which still exists, was used for balls and dinners and the whole area was specifically for the benefit of the Cadbury workers and their families with no charges for the use of any of the sporting facilities by Cadbury employees or their families. The lido was eventually closed in the 1970s after complaints of noise disturbance were made by residents of the newly built Oak Farm estate, coupled with new and stringent health and safety regulations relating to outdoor public swimming facilities. Cadbury's also built the Bournville indoor swimming baths on Bournville Lane (separate buildings for 'girls' and men), the Valley pool boating lake and the picturesque cricket pitch adjacent to the factory site, that was made famous as the picture on boxes of Milk Tray chocolates throughout the 1950s and early 1960s.

In 1900, the Bournville Village Trust was set up to formally control the development of the estate, independently of George Cadbury or the Cadbury company. The trust focused on providing schools, hospitals, museums, public baths and reading rooms. As Bournville is a conservation area, another job of the Bournville Village Trust is to accept or reject plans for building extension and modification.

An almost campus feel evolved, with a triangular village green, infant and junior schools, the School of Art and the Day Continuation School (originally intended for young Cadbury employees) and a host of events such as fêtes and Maypole dances. The carillon and a Quaker meeting house are also beside the village green.

The trust continues to exercise an international influence on housing and town planning generally. Now containing 7,800 homes on 1,000 acres (4 km²) of land with 100 acres (0.4 km²) of parks and open spaces, Bournville remains a popular residential area of Birmingham.

Cadbury is still one of Birmingham's main employers, making all manner of chocolate products.

The dark chocolate Bournville Plain is now manufactured in France and sold in the UK.

Cadbury also named their brand of malted drinks Bournvita after Bournville.

The ward is served by two councillors, both of whom are Labour; Liz Clements and Fred Grindrod.

Autoethnography

Autoethnography is a method of social research whose defining characteristic is that the author links personal experience and autobiography with social, political, and cultural concepts. Its difference from ethnography is the high degree of subjectivity that is introduced to the study, and the fact that the perspective of the author shows personal involvement with the subject much more than participant observation invites.

Maréchal defines auto-ethnography as “a form or method of research that involves self-observation and reflexive investigation in the context of ethnographic field work and writing”. In the 1970s it was more simply defined as “insider ethnography”, referring to the fact that the group of study is the ethnographer’s own.

The most significant element that auto-ethnography introduces to the study of culture and society is the shift from a depersonalized, “seen from a vantage point” and neutrally distanced narrative to a storyline with which the audience can engage morally, aesthetically, and intellectually, and, thus, co-participate in the events described. Especially for ethnographers who use multiple informants, auto-ethnography introduces an alternative way of writing where “the distinction between ethnographer and ‘others’ is unclear”, thereby challenging “imposed identities and boundaries”.

However, auto-ethnographers should avoid some dangerous pitfalls that could undermine the credibility and usefulness of their work. Chang identifies the following: "(1) excessive focus on self in isolation from others; (2) overemphasis on narration rather than analysis and cultural interpretation; (3) exclusive reliance on personal memory and recalling as a data source; (4) negligence of ethical standards regarding others in self-narratives; and (5) inappropriate application of the label autoethnography".

Cape Girardeau is a city in eastern Missouri. It is next to the Mississippi River.

Homo sacer

Homo sacer (Latin for the ‘sacred man’ or ‘accursed man’) is a phrase taken from Roman law. It is
used to describe someone who is banished, and may be killed by anybody but not used in a religious killing
(sacrifice). Described by Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben in his book "Homo Sacer"; ‘sovereign
power and bare life’ as a person who is living a ‘naked life’ and is an outcast of society.

Someone becomes Homo Sacer by breaking a legal agreement or oath; people who
illegally cross the borders between countries have often been referred to and treated as Homo
Sacer. In Shahram Khosravi’s book "Illegal traveller" he talks about how someone
forced to leave their country to find a better life elsewhere can become ‘homo sacer’, which can
lead to a feeling of separation from the rest of society.

This makes the person an outlaw; they have no civil rights and lose their protection
from the state. They are often victims of abuse and unfair treatment both through this loss of rights
but also from everyday citizens.


Ireland at the Olympics

Ireland has been at the Summer Olympic Games since 1924, and at the Winter Olympic Games since 1992. Before 1922, Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Irish athletes at earlier Games are counted as British in Olympic numbers.

The following tables include medals won by athletes on Irish teams together with one poet. All medals are from the Summer Games. Ireland's best result at the Winter Games was fourth, by Clifton Wrottesley in the Men's Skeleton in 2002 at Salt Lake City.



Rite of passage

A rites of passage is a ritual performed by people, either individually or as a social group. It marks the end of one phase of life, and the arrival of another.

All people in every society and culture experience rites of passage. They happen differently, for various reasons, and at special times, depending on what society or culture the person comes from. Rites of passage celebrate and protect the person or people who are changing. They signify the transformation from one social status (e.g. coming of age), place (e.g. crossing a national border), condition (e.g. recovering from sickness), time (e.g. celebrating the new year), to the next.

The French social scientist Arnold van Gennep (23 April 1873 – 7 May 1957) most famously defined the concept of rites of passage in his book "" ("The Rites of Passage"), first published in 1909. Van Gennep studied ethnographic reports from various parts of the world that described rites of passage. He concluded that they are universally structured even if the rites of passage themselves differ significantly in character between societies and cultures.

Rites of passage are ordered into three phases.


By learning about the rites of passage of different societies and cultures perform rites of passage, we can understand others and ourselves. With awareness of cultural diversity, we can form an open-minded, tolerant and accepting view of people who are not from the same society or culture as our own.


Israel at the Olympics

Israel has been at the Olympic Games as a nation since 1952. Its National Olympic Committee was formed in 1933 during the British Mandate of Palestine. As the team represented the Jewish community, it boycotted the 1936 Games in Germany in protest of the Nazi Party's anti-Semitic policies. Israel has sent a team to each Summer Olympic Games since 1952 (except the 1980 Summer Olympics) and to each Winter Olympic Games since 1994. In 1972, 11 members of the Israeli delegation were murdered by Black September terrorists.

Totemism

Totemism is a belief about the relationship between people and nature. The term totem comes from an Ojibwe word meaning “a relative of mine”. It was first written about in 1791 by a trader, James Long. It has been recorded across native tribes of America, Africa and Australia. It has been the subject of much research into ethnic groups. Usually, totems of a kinship group will be animals or plants. They will be represented in sacred objects and will belong exclusively to them.

Totemism was considered a primitive religion by many European thinkers in the 1800s. It was thought to be related to beliefs about food and incest taboos. In 1869, John Ferguson McLennan said that "there is no race of men that has not come through this primitive stage of speculative belief". Early thinkers had the idea that beliefs in totemism came from indiginous clans being uneducated about the difference between humans and animals. This is not still talked about as true in modern discussions on totemism.

Totem poles are carved with symbols on large trees, mostly cedar or spruce, by native northwest North American clans. Totem poles are also found in Alaska. They are not for worship, but early missionaries had them burned down. This was a mistake because the poles just tell stories about the clan they belong to. Eagles or ravens are carved at the highest level. Lower down the pole are carved beavers, foxes, bears and frogs. A carving of a person is located on top. He is the watchman, who warns about approaching danger in the village.

Émile Durkheim said in 1915 that totemism was just a way of thinking about groups in society. Durkheim decided this because he spent time working with Aboriginal Australian clans. Each clan had its own totem, which could be any natural feature such as animals, plants or rivers. These totems and symbols of them were worshiped and protected. This was because only as long as the totem was healthy would the clan stay healthy. Durkheim decided that the worship of the totems was a type of self-worship for the clan. 

Claude Lévi-Strauss published "Totemism" in 1962. In this book he says that totemism is a way that humans tend to classify people into similar groups. Once a population has made rules like exogamy (marrying outside the group) it becomes important to keep the clan different from others. But humans themselves do not have different features like wolves or birds do, so giving the identity of an animal to the clan makes its member distinctly different. This makes social boundaries.


Italy at the Olympics

Italy at the Olympics is a history which includes 50 games in 23 countries and 4,000+ athletes. Since 1896, Italy (ITA) has contributed to the growth of the "Olympic Movement".
The Italian National Olympic Committee was formed in 1908. It was recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1915.

Italy's team first competed at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens.

Italy has been at most of the Olympic Games, missing only the 1904 Summer Olympics. Italian athletes have won 550 medals at the Summer Olympic Games and another 106 medals at the Winter Olympic Games. Italy has won a total of 236 gold medals which makes them the 5th most successful country in Olympic history, below USA, Soviet Union, Germany and Great Britain.

Fencer Edoardo Mangiarotti has won the most medals for Italy.

     Leading in that sport
Italy has hosted the Games three times:



Neocolonialism

Neocolonialism is a system where empires pretend to let their colonies be free, but they continue to run them secretly. The term "neo" means "new", so it means that the system is a new version of colonialism. The word neocolonialism was carefully explained by socialists in the 1960s, who were afraid their countries wouldn't really be independent. The socialists mostly talked about the old empires controlling the politics and economy of their countries, but some people also talk about neocolonialism as a way to control culture too.

Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of Ghana after it became independent from the British Empire, wrote a well-known book about neocolonialism. Many people have heard of the idea because of his book. Che Guevara is another famous opponent of neocolonialism.

Most people who use the word neocolonialism and believe it describes the world today are socialists, anti-imperialists, and other types of leftists. Liberals and right-wing people tend to disagree with the idea of neocolonialism.

Saar at the 1952 Summer Olympics

A National Olympic Committee of the Saarland was created in spring of 1950 in the "Saar protectorate", a part of Western Germany that was controlled in 1945 by France. As a separate team, they only took part in the 1952 Summer Olympics. The athletes of Saar joined the German team for the summer games of 1956. 36 people, 31 men and 5 women, took part in 32 events in 9 sports. The Protectorate became the German state of Saarland after 1956.

After World War II, the Saarland was not allowed to become part of the Federal Republic of Germany in May 1949. Its annexation by France was not allowed by the other Allies and the Atlantic charter's points 2 and 3.

Because local population did not want to join France, separate international organisations were created. These included the Saarland football team and in 1950 a NOC, in German called "Nationales Olympisches Komitee des Saarlandes". The region did not send athletes to Oslo for the 1952 Winter Olympics.

The Saarland had history of over 500 years of coal mining. They gave a miner's safety lamp in which the flame of the torch relay of the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki could be carried safely on airplanes. At the opening ceremony, 36 athletes from the Saarland marched in front of the team of Germany. They did not win a medal.

Bariatrics

Bariatrics is the part of medicine that deals with obesity. Bariatrics includes using dieting, exercise, changing people's habits, drugs, and surgery to help people lose weight.

More and more people are becoming overweight or obese. People with a high body mass index (BMI) are much more likely to have certain health problems. These include heart disease, diabetes, many types of cancer, asthma, sleep apnea, and problems with muscles and bones. Obese people are also more likely to die.

Diet, exercise, changing people's habits, and drugs are tried first to help people lose weight. People who have weight loss surgery usually lose more weight than those who try the other ways. The surgery also helps reduce diseases like high blood pressure and diabetes. With each patient, doctors might use some or all of the methods, depending on what they think would work best for that patient.

Ismaili Shia (or Ismailiya; ) are a Shia Muslim sect. They are different from the usual Shia Islam because they do not agree on who the 7th Imam, or religiousleader is. Unlike other Shia Muslims, they believe that Ismail ibn Jafar was the 7th Imam. Most Shia Muslims believe that Musa ibn Jafar was the 7th Imam. Ismail died when his father, Jafar ibn Muhammad the 6th Imam was still alive. They believed that Ismail's son Muhammad was the next Imam and deserted the sixth Imam. 

They are split into several sects. The biggest of these are the Nizaris. They are led by the 49th Imam Aga Khan, another title of the Ismaili Imams. The current Aga Khan is Karim Al Hussaini.

Zaidiyyah

The Zaidiyyah () are a Shia Muslim sect. They are different from the usual Shia Islam. This is because of the argument over the who the 5th Imam, or religious leader, is. They believe the 5th Imam was Zaid ibn Ali while usual Shia Muslims believe that his brother, Muhammad, was the 5th Imam. Zaydi Muslims also follow a long list of other imams after imam Zayd Bin Ali. Zaydi Muslims believe the imam isn't appointed by God, unlike other Shia Muslims. Other ways Zaydis are different from other Shia Muslims include prohibition of mutah, not doing taqleed, and believing imams can make mistakes and should be overthrown if they do.

Today, they make up 40% of the population of Yemen. The president of Yemen is also Zaidi. There are also Zaidis in Najran in Saudi Arabia as well as in Qarsherskiy. 

Zaydism has 3 major sub sects:

Jarudiyya is a Zaydi sect where they curse Abu Bakr and the rest of the companions for giving the caliphate to Ali, and believe that Ali was the rightful caliph similar to followers of the religion of Twelverism.

Sulaymaniyya is a Zaydi sect where they believe that the caliphate of Abu Bakr and Umar were done mistakenly and believe that Ali was the rightful caliph. Their beliefs are rooted in both the religion of Twelverism and Sunni beliefs.

Salihiyya is a Zaydi sect where they believe similarly to Sulaymaniyya that the caliphate of Abu Bakr and Umar were done mistakenly but also accept the caliphates of the other companions of Muhammad. They are closest to the sect of Sunnism in their beliefs.

Jin dynasty (1115–1234)

The Jin dynasty (1115–1234) is also known as the Jurchen dynasty, and as the Great Jin. It was one of the last dynasties before Mongol invasion (and eventual conquest) of China.

The dynasty was founded by the Wanyan (完顏 Wányán) clan of the Jurchens. These were the ancestors of the Manchu, who established the Qing dynasty some 500 years later. The Jin Dynasty was founded in northern Manchuria, The founder was Wanyan Aguda (完顏阿骨打).

The name of this dynasty is sometimes written as "Jinn" to differentiate it from an earlier Jin dynasty (265-420) of China whose name is spelt identically in the Roman alphabet.
The History of Jin recorded that Tangkuo Dingge (唐括定哥), Consort Gui (貴妃) was a Jurchen woman. She was first married to the Jurchen Jin royal Wanyan Wudai (完顏烏帶. She had an affair with her Han Chinese slave, Yan Qi'er (閻乞兒) and with Wanyan Liang (Prince Hailing). When Wanyan Liang became emperor of the Jin dynasty he forced Dingge to have her husband Wanyan Wudai killed by her other slaves, Ge Wen (葛溫) and Ge Lu (葛魯) and he promised that she would be named empress. Wanyan Liang broke his promise after he got bored of her when she entered the harem. Dingge then smuggled Yan Qi'er into the palace through a trunk after first smuggling a trunk full of her clothes as a dummy and then reprimanded him for looking at her clothes so he wouldn't look when Yan Qi'er was smuggled in next. Dingge and Yan Qi'er had sex until a Jurchen maid, Guige (貴哥) told on them to the emperor and Dingge was strangled and Yan Qi'er was beheaded.

Jurchen people

The Jurchens were a Tungusic people who lived in Manchuria in present-day Northeast China. They were known as Jurchens until the 17th century when they became known as the "Manchu". 

The Jurchens established the Jin Dynasty. The Jurchen Wanyan Yingge's paternal nephew Wanyan Wuyashu however fought against the Koreans, forcing them to submit and recognize Jurchens as overlords after "pacifying" the border between the Koreans and Jurchens.

The Joseon Dynasty of Korea placed great value on a policy of "neighborly relations" ("gyorin" or "kyorin") with the Jurchen people.

Hans Motz

Hans Motz (1 October 1909 – 6 August 1987) was an Austrian physicist. He worked at Stanford University on undulators. His work led to the development of the free-electron laser.

He was born in Vienna, and died in Oxford, England.

Hans Motz was a Full Professor in the Department of Engineering at Oxford University and a Fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford.

He wrote books, including "The Physics of Fusion", and a book on microwave theory. When he died, he left money to Oxford to establish a Motz Prize in Electrical Engineering to honor top students.

Discrete mathematics

Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are discrete rather than continuous. In contrast to real numbers that vary "smoothly", discrete mathematics studies objects such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic. These objects do not vary smoothly, but have distinct, separated values. Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as calculus and analysis. Discrete objects can often be counted using integers. Mathematicians say that this is the branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets (sets that have the same cardinality as subsets of the natural numbers, including rational numbers but not real numbers). However, there is no exact, universally agreed, definition of the term "discrete mathematics." Many times, discrete mathematics is described less by what is included than by what is excluded: continuously varying quantities and related notions.

The set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite. The term finite mathematics is sometimes applied to parts of the field of discrete mathematics that deals with finite sets, particularly those areas relevant to business.

Research in discrete mathematics increased in the latter half of the twentieth century partly due to the development of digital computers which operate in discrete steps and store data in discrete bits. Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of computer science, such as computer algorithms, programming languages, cryptography, automated theorem proving, and software development. In turn, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real-world problems, such as in operations research, game theory and graph theory.

Although the main objects of study in discrete mathematics are discrete objects, analytic methods from continuous mathematics are often employed as well.

Emperor Yōzei

Before he became the monarch, his personal name ("imina") was .

Yōzei was the oldest son of Emperor Seiwa. His mother was the Fujiwara no Takakiko. She was the sister of Fujiwara no Mototsune.

Yōzei was made emperor when he was a young boy.

Yōzei was succeeded by his father's uncle, who became known as Emperor Koko. During the reign of Kōkō's son, Emperor Uda, the former emperor became dangerous again.
Yōzei lived in retirement until the age of 81.

The actual site of Yōzei's grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Kyoto.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Yōzei's mausoleum. It is formally named "Kaguragaoka no Higashi no misasagi".

The years of Yōzei's reign are more identified by more than one Japanese era.

In ancient Japan, there were four noble clans, the "Gempeitōkitsu" (源平藤橘). One of these clans, the Minamoto clan (源氏) are also known as Genji, and of these, the "Yōzei Genji" (陽成源氏) are descended from the 57th emperor Yōzei.

Yōzei fathered nine sons who were born after his abdication.

Ocala, Florida

Ocala is a city in Marion County, Florida. In 2020, the number of people recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau was 63,591. It is the county seat of Marion County, and the principal city of the Ocala, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, which in the 2020 census had a population of 375,908.

Ocala is found near the old site of Ocale or Ocali, a major Timucua village and chiefdom during the 16th century. The city of Ocala today borrowed the name from the village. The name is believed to mean "Big Hammock" in the Timucua language. Hernando de Soto passed through Ocale during his famous journey through what is today the southeastern United States in 1539. Ocale is not mentioned in any later accounts; it seems to have been abandoned in the wake of de Soto's attack.

In 1827 the U.S. army outpost of Fort King was built near the current site of Ocala as a buffer between Seminoles and white settlers. The fort saw service during the Second Seminole War and was later used as the first courthouse for Marion County in 1844. Fort King was the beginning of the current city of Ocala, which was established in 1846. Greater Ocala is known as the "Kingdom of the Sun". Rail service reached Ocala in June 1881, encouraging economic development. Two years later, much of the Ocala downtown area was destroyed by a fire on Thanksgiving Day, 1883. Buildings were rebuilt with brick, granite and steel rather than lumber. By 1888, Ocala was known state-wide as "The Brick City".

In December 1890, the Farmers' Alliance and Industrial Union, an early version of the Populist Party held its national meeting in Ocala. At the meeting, the Alliance adopted a platform that would become known as the "Ocala Demands". This platform included removal of national banks, low interest government loans, free and limitless coinage of silver, reclamation of excess railroad lands taken by the government, a graduated income tax, and direct election of United States senators. Most of the "Ocala Demands" were to become part of the Populist Party platform.

Ocala was an important center of citrus production until the Great Freeze of 1894-1895.

In the twentieth century, Ocala increased in fame as a center for tourism in Florida. Important attractions included the Silver Springs Nature Theme Park, Wild Waters water park, and the now-defunct Western-themed Six Gun Territory, all in nearby Silver Springs, Florida. (See Six Gun Territory Gallery.) Silver Springs is a nature theme park that surrounds the headwaters of the Silver River, the largest artesian spring formation in the world.

The first thoroughbred horse farm in Florida was created by Carl G. Rose in 1943. Earlier, in 1916, Rose had come to Florida from Indiana to oversee the first asphalt road ever constructed in the state. When he ran into problems with the asphalt, he tried to work with one of Florida's abundant resources: limestone. He also realized that the limestone would be a good source of nutrition for raising strong horses, so he took a gamble in 1943 and bought acreage along State Highway 200 at $10 per acre, which became Rosemere Farm. The next year one of his horses, Gornil, won at Miami's Tropical Park, making him the first Florida-raised thoroughbred to win a Florida race. Close on Rose's heels, the entrepreneur Bonnie Heath soon set up his own thoroughbred horse farm and produced the state's first Kentucky Derby winner. Both of these men have major highways named after them in Ocala. Bonnie Heath Farm is now owned and operated by his son Bonnie Heath, III, and his wife Kim. Rosemere Farm was sold long ago, and Ocala's Paddock Mall and Central Florida College were built on the site.

In 1956, the Ocala area Thoroughbred market received a raise when Needles became the first Florida-bred to win the Kentucky Derby. In 1978, Marion County-bred and -raised Affirmed won the Triple Crown. Today, Marion County is one of the major thoroughbred centers of the world, with over 1,200 horse farms in total and about 900 thoroughbred farms totaling some . Ocala is well known as the horse capital of the world, one of only five cities (four in the USA and one in France) allowed under Chamber of Commerce guidelines to use this title based on yearly money produced by the horse industry. There are some 44,000 jobs created by the breeding, training and related support brought about by the horse industry that generates over $2.2 billion in yearly money. Ocala and "Postime Farms" also support one of the biggest horse shows in the country. H.I.T.S or "Horses in the Sun" is a Dressage/Jumper event lasting about two months and brings with it some 6 to 7 million dollars to the local Marion county economy each year. There are over 100 different breeds aside from thoroughbreds including the Tennessee Walker, Paso Fino, Morgans, SaddleBreds, Drafts, and the American Quarter Horse. Other horse events in the area include cowboy mounted shooting by the Florida Outlaws, as well as endurance rides, barrel races, "extreme" cowboy events, jumper shows, trick shows, parades, draft pulls, and more.

Ocala began undergoing rapid growth in the 1970s with the development of the Interstate 75 and the founding of Disney World, located some southeast.

In the last decades of the twentieth century, the greater Ocala area experienced one of the highest growth rates in the country for a city its size. The population of Marion County in 2000 was over 250,000, up from under 100,000 in 1975. Much of the county's growth is attributable to the area's growing popularity as a retirement destination, primarily in two areas southwest and south of the city: the SR 200 corridor and The Villages, respectively.
Many historic homes are preserved in Ocala's large housing Historic District, established in 1984. A focus of this district is East Fort King Street, featuring many excellent examples of Victorian architecture. Ocala structures on the National Register of Historic Places include the Coca Cola Building, the E. C. Smith House, East Hall, the Marion Hotel, Mount Zion A.M.E. Church, the Ritz Historic Inn, and Union Train Station.

The original Fort King site itself was called a National Historic Landmark in 2004.

Ocala is governed by a five member board of councilors and a mayor, all of which are chosen without caring about their party. Its charter was written in the council-manager form, leaving the mayor with few powers other than refusing legislation passed by the council and tending to some duties involving the police department. The city manager handles most leadership and money issues. Although a small majority of the city's voters are Democrats, Ocala's politics match those of the rest of Marion County in that all of its elected legislators - with one exception - are registered Republicans. In the 2008 presidential election, John McCain carried both the city and the county, the second one by a landslide, even though they lost Florida as a whole to Barack Obama by a narrow margin.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The surrounding farms are famous for their thoroughbred horses, in terrain similar to Kentucky bluegrass. Ocala is also known for nearby Silver Springs, Florida, site of one of the largest artesian spring formations in the world and Silver Springs Nature Theme Park, one of the earliest tourist attractions in Florida.

The long Ocklawaha River flows north from Central Florida until it joins the St. Johns River near Palatka, Florida.

Marion County is also home to the Ocala National Forest which was established in 1908 and is now the second largest national forest in the state. The Florida Trail, also known as the Florida National Scenic Trail, cuts through Ocala National Forest.

Silver River State Park was established in the early 1990s to preserve the areas around the Silver River to the east of Ocala near Silver Springs.

Ocala has two main seasons: the dry season (October–May) and the wet season (June–September). During the dry season, there is almost endless sunshine with very little rain. In January, the morning low temperatures are often in the 30s and 40s, but the cloudless sunny weather typically warms the dry air up to near 70 by the afternoon. During the wet season, afternoon thunderstorms are a daily thing. These storms are often severe (unofficially, Ocala is known to have more cloud-to-ground lightning per square mile than any other city in the world). The typical morning low temperatures during the wet season are in the 70's and typical daytime high temperatures are in the 90s. Due to the city being relatively far away from the moderating influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, Ocala's summertime temperatures are often the highest in the state while winter temperatures are often the lowest compared to other cities on the peninsula. Also, Ocala's distance from the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico means the city has more days of sunshine than Florida's coastal cities. This is, in part, why the Ocala/Marion County area is called "the kingdom of the sun." The last snowfall of any significance fell on December 24, 1989, when the city was struck by an ice and snow storm. However, the morning of January 9, 2010, there was a dusting of snow on the ground in city center. A plume of record cold air mixed with moisture caused wintry precipitation to erupt across northern and central Florida.
As of the census of 2020, there were 63,591 people living in the city. There were 28,284 housing units, of which 25,531 were occupied (90.3%). The racial makeup of the city was 60.0% White, 19.3% African American, 0.3% Native American, 3.9% Asian, 5.3% from other races, and 11.2% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 17.1% of the population.

In 2022, the median income for a household in the city was about $44,756, and the median income for a family was about $53,917. The per capita income for the city was about $24,066. About 23.1% of people were below the poverty line, including 32.1% of those under age 18 and 19.4% of those age 65 or over.

Ocala is the headquarters of Emergency One, a worldwide designer and manufacturer of fire rescue vehicles.

Ocala is home to the College of Central Florida. It also has one of 21 campuses of Rasmussen College, an Higher Learning Commission regionally accredited post secondary institution.

Ocala is home to Trinity Catholic High School, which holds the record for the longest high school football championship game in Florida history, going into triple overtime.
on January 6, 2011, the mayor declared January 6 as Trinity Catholic Celtics Day, in honor of this feat.

Ocala, Florida was home Belleview Bulldogs in the FCSL before it folded in 2008. It is also home to one of the largest youth football leagues in the state in the MCYFL. Ocala is hosting the regional events for the Junior League in the Little League World Series in August 2010.

In 1995, Ocala was named an All-America City Award winner.

Ocala has two sister cities:

Several major highways pass through Ocala, including Interstate 75, U.S. Highway 27, U.S. Route 301, and U.S. Highway 441. Ocala was on the western leg of the historic Dixie Highway.


Ocala International Airport provides general aviation services to the community. Ocala Suntran provides bus service throughout select parts of the city. One of the major hubs for Suntran is the former Ocala Union Station, which served Amtrak trains until November 2004.

Ocala is the home for the Ocala Symphony Orchestra. The Ocala Symphony Orchestra, Inc., a non-profit organization, began in 1975, when a group of musicians and citizens set out to create a symphonic orchestra for the area. In the fall of 1976 a four-concert subscription season was initiated - a format that continues to this day. The Ocala Symphony Orchestra was later incorporated in the State of Florida and recognized by the IRS as a 501c3 non-profit corporation.

Also, the Ocala Civic Theatre is located in Ocala, and it presents professional-quality, live productions at an affordable price. Ocala Civic Theatre produces more than twelve fully staged productions each season, in addition to hosting touring companies. The Theatre offers a year-round education program that reaches over 1000 students each year. Both skills classes and performance classes are offered to students ages 4–18. This volunteer-based organization is one of the largest community theaters in the state and serves more than 50,000 Marion, Citrus and Lake County residents each season.

Russia at the Olympics

Russia has been at the modern Olympic Games many times. They have been called different nations. As the Russian Empire, they were first at the 1900 Games. They returned again in 1908 and 1912. After the Russian revolution in 1917, and the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922, they were not at the Olympics again until the 1952 Summer Olympics. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia competed as part of the Unified Team in 1992. They returned once again as "Russia" at the 1994 Winter Olympics.

The Soviet Union hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Russia will host the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.

Since 2012, Russian athletes have won a total of 404 medals (399 since 1994) at the Summer Olympic Games. They have another 91 at the Winter Olympic Games. Over the most recent ten Games (since 1994), Russia's 495 total medals, including 170 gold medals, are second only to the United States (with 631 and 237, respectively).

The Russian Olympic Committee was formed in 1991 and recognized in 1993.

Advanced Light Source

The Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California is a synchrotron light source. It was built from 1987 to 1993. 210 scientists and staff currently work there.

The ALS is a national user facility. The ALS makes intense light for scientific and technological research. It is one of the world's brightest sources of ultraviolet and soft x-ray beams. Each year over 2000 researchers go to the ALS from universities, industries, and government laboratories around the world. ALS is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Basic Energy Sciences.

The ALS has over forty beamlines. They do a wide range of science at the same time as each other. Any qualified scientist can ask to use the ALS beamlines. Proposals are reviewed by others. The proposals which most people agree on are allowed to use the ALS. The ALS does not charge money to use if the user's research is made public.

The Advanced Light Source's current director is Roger Falcone.

Physicists in Berkeley California began working on accelerating subatomic particles in the 1920s. In 1929, Ernest O. Lawrence built the first cyclotron to accelerate subatomic particles. During World War II, a laboratory there was a part of the Manhattan Project. They were given money from the military. In 1942, Lawrence hired Arthur Brown, Jr. (designer of the Coit Tower in San Francisco) to design a new round building to hold Lawrence's new 4.67 m (184 in) cyclotron. That building, with expansions, is the one which the ALS is in today. The laboratory was a part of the United States Atomic Energy Commission until 1977 when it was moved to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Physicists kept on improving particle accelerators by increasing their energy. The designers wanted higher energy to study smaller building blocks of matter. From the start, physicists realized that as charged particles spun around, they gave off electromagnetic radiation. In the early 1950s, other scientists started to use this radiation for experiments unrelated to the "atom smashing" collisions that were the primary goal of the machines. Particle accelerators shifted from cyclotrons to synchrotrons where the particles traveled in a circle rather than in a spiral path. Construction costs increased as synchrotrons got bigger to the point that many nations joined to build just one very big synchrotron in Europe (CERN) to conduct atom smashing experiments. Other synchrotron labs, such as the Lawrence Berkeley Lab did not have enough energy to discover new particles. So, they switched to using their machines as a source of electromagnetic radiation. Instead of tuning the machine to make particles travel faster, they learned how to wiggle the particle beam to give off particular frequencies of light. In the 1980s and 1990s, scientists wanted to redesign synchrotrons to generate brighter light (more intense electromagnetic radiation) than ever before. These designs were called "third generation synchrotrons." The ALS was the first third generation synchrontron put into operation.

When the Advanced Light Source was first proposed in the early 1980s by former Lawrence Berkeley Lab director David Shirley, skeptics dubbed it "Shirley's Temple" and doubted the use of a synchrotron tuned to make soft x-rays and ultraviolet light. According to former ALS director Daniel Chemla, "The scientific case for a third-generation soft x-ray facility such as the ALS had always been fundamentally sound. However, getting the larger scientific community to believe it was an uphill battle"

In the 1987 Reagan administration budget, President Ronald Reagan allocated $1.5 million for the construction of the Advanced Light Source.


Undulator

An undulator is an insertion device from high-energy physics and usually part of a larger installation, a synchrotron storage ring. It is a periodic structure of dipole magnets. A static magnetic field is alternating along the length of the undulator with a wavelength formula_1. Electrons traversing the periodic magnet structure are forced to oscillate. So the electrons give off energy as electronmagnetic radiation. The radiation produced in an undulator is very intense and concentrated in narrow energy bands in the spectrum. The light beam is also collimated on the orbit plane of the electrons. This radiation is guided through beamlines for experiments in various scientific areas.

The important dimensionless parameter 

formula_2 

where "e" is the particle charge, "B" is the magnetic field, "formula_3", "formula_4" is the electron rest mass and "c" is the speed of light, characterizes the nature of the electron motion. For formula_5 the oscillation amplitude of the motion is small and the radiation displays interference patterns which lead to narrow energy bands. If formula_6 the oscillation amplitude is bigger and the radiation contributions from each field period sum up independently, leading to a broad energy spectrum. When K is much bigger than 1, the device is no longer called an "undulator"; it is called a wiggler.

Physicist think about undulators both using classical physics and relativity. This means that though the precision calculation is tedious the undulator can be seen as a black box. An electron enters this box and an electromagnetic pulse exits through a small exit slit. The slit should be small enough so that only the main cone passes, so that the side lobes may be ignored. 

Undulators can provide hundreds of time more magnetic flux than a simple bending magnet and as such are in high demand at synchrotron radiation facilities. For an undulator that repeat N times (N periods), the brightness can be up to formula_7 more than a bending magnet. The intensity is enhanced up to a factor of N at harmonic wavelengths due to the constructive interference of the fields emitted during the N radiation periods. The usual pulse is a sine wave with some envelope. The second factor of N comes from the reduction of the emission angle associated with these harmonics, which is reduced in proportion to 1/N. When the electrons come with half the period, they interfere destructively. So, the undulator stays dark. The same is true if the electrons come as a bead chain. Because the bunch of electron spreads out the more times that they travel around the synchrotron, physicists want to design new machines that throw out the electron bunches before they have a chance to spread out. This change will produced more useful synchrotron radiation.

The polarization of the emitted radiation can be controlled by using permanent magnets to induce different periodic electron trajectories through the undulator. If the oscillations are confined to a plane the radiation will be linearly polarized. If the oscillation trajectory is helical, the radiation will be circularly polarized, with the handedness determined by the helix.

If the electrons follow the Poisson distribution, a partial interference leads to a linear increase in intensity.
In the free-electron laser the intensity increases exponentially with the number of electrons. 

Physicists measure an undulator's effectiveness in terms of spectral radiance.

The first undulator was built by Hans Motz and his coworkers at Stanford in 1953. One of their undulators produced the first ever coherent infrared radiation. Their total frequency range was from visible light down to millimeter waves. The Russian physicist V.L. Ginzburg showed that undulators could be made in principle in a 1947 paper.

Storytime

"Storytime" is a song by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish. The song was written by keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, who also created the band. It was the lead single from the band's seventh studio album "Imaginaerum" (2011). "Storytime" has vocals by the vocalist of Nightwish, Anette Olzon. The single was released on November 9, 2011 from Nuclear Blast with mostly positive reviews from music journalists. 

The song is about human expressions through folklore tales such as "Peter Pan" and "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland". It also talks about Gaia, a mythical Greek Earth goddess, in the song. A music video was released to promote "Storytime" in November 2011, it features the entire band playing their instruments in a "fantasy" world. After the single's release on radios, it peaked at number-one on the Finnish Singles Chart and peaked within the top 5 in Spain, Hungary, and the United Kingdom.

Imaginaerum

Imaginaerum is the seventh album by the Finnish symphonic metal group Nightwish. It is their second album with Swedish vocalist Anette Olzon. A movie of the same name was released in 2012. The movie has songs from the album in it. The album was No.1 in Finland.


Anette Olzon

Anette Ingegerd Olsson (born 21 June 1971) better known as Anette Olzon (married name Blyckert) is a Swedish singer. She is the current lead singer of the Finnish symphonic metal group Nightwish. She used to be the lead singer of Aylson Avenue.

Romania at the Olympics

Romania at the Olympics is a history which began in 1900.

The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for Romania was RUM. It is now ROU.

A team from Romania was first at the Olympic Games in 1900. They had only one participant. The National Olympic Committee for Romania is the "Romanian Olympic and Sports Committee". It was formed and recognized in 1914. The nation first sent a team to the Games in 1924. They have been to each of the Summer Olympic Games and Winter Olympic Games since then except for two times. Notably, Romania was the lone Eastern Bloc nation to participate at the 1984 Summer Olympics, which the other nations boycotted. That was also Romania's most successful Olympic Games: they won 20 gold medals and 53 medals total.

Romanian athletes have won a total of 293 medals, with gymnastics as the top medal-producing sport.



Serbia at the Olympics

Serbia was first at the Olympic Games in 1912. After 96 years, Serbia returned to the Olympics as an independent team at the 2008 Summer Olympics. From 1920 to the 1992 Winter Olympics Serbian athletes were part of the Yugoslavian team. At the 1992 Summer Olympics they took part as Independent Olympic Participants. This was because the United Nations was threatening to punish Serbia. Because of this, no Serbians were at the 1994 Winter Olympics. The threats stopped in 1995. From the 1996 Summer Olympics to the 2006 Winter Olympics they were part of the Serbia and Montenegro team.

 



Slovakia at the Olympics

Slovakia was first at the Olympic Games in 1994. They have been in every Games since then. Before Czechoslovakia broke up in 1993, Slovak athletes competed for Czechoslovakia at the Olympics.

Slovak athletes have won twenty medals altogether at the Summer Olympic Games. These were mostly for canoeing. The nation has also won four medals at the Winter Olympic Games.

The National Olympic Committee for Slovakia was made in 1992 and recognized in 1993.



Slovenia at the Olympics

Slovenia was first an independent nation at the Olympic Games in 1992. They have been in every Games since then. Prior to the breakup of Yugoslavia, Slovenian athletes were part of Yugoslavia at the Olympics.

The National Olympic Committee for Slovenia was formed in 1991 and recognized in 1993. Slovenian athletes have won a total of fifteen medals at the Summer Olympic Games and another seven at the Winter Olympic Games.



Sweden at the Olympics

Sweden was first at the Olympic Games at the inaugural 1896 Games. They have been in every Games since then with one exception for the 1904 Summer Olympics. Sweden has earned medals at all Olympic games except for two, the 1896 Games and the 1904 Games.

Sweden hosted the Games on one occasion, the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. The equestrian events of the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne were held in Stockholm, due to quarantine reasons.

Swedish athletes have a total of 475 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, and another 118 at the Winter Olympic Games.

The International Olympic Committee had Swedish officer and sports instructor Viktor Balck as one of its original members. The Swedish Olympic Committee was formed and recognized in 1913.

2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018 Winter Games bids were declared non-finished applications by the Swedish Olympic Committee, due lack of political support from the Swedish government. The reason has been that the bidding is financially insecure for the Swedish society as a nation. 2018 Winter Olympic Games bids were promised support by the former government, but when the new government was elected, the bid was withdrawn. Östersund and Åre were the only applicant cities.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Total medal counts include six medals – three gold, two silver, and one bronze – awarded in the 1908 and 1920 figure skating events. These medals are included in the summer games medal totals and the winter sport medal totals. This is why the totals for summer and winter games do not match the totals for summer and winter sports.



Scarlet fever

Scarlet fever is an infectious disease that is caused by bacteria. It is caused by exotoxin released by Streptococcus pyogenes. It was once a major cause of death. It is now treated with antibiotics. The term scarlatina can be used to mean scarlet fever. Scarlatina is a lesser form of scarlet fever. At the early times, this disease could not be cured and this was a common reason for death in that time which applies to many famous people of the world.

RTI Colombia

RTI Colombia (Radio Televisión Interamericana - in Spanish; Inter-American Radio and Television) is a Colombian television production company. Many of its series are co-produced with Telemundo, their strategic partner from the United States whose owner is NBC.


Irish House of Lords

Irish House of Lords was the upper chamber of the Irish Parliament from its creation in the thirteenth century to its abolition in 1800-1801. It was made up of the barons and clergy of the island. After the reformation the clergy in the Lords came from the Church of Ireland.

Henry Grattan

Henry Grattan (3 July 1746 – 6 June 1820) was an Irish politician. He was a member of the Irish House of Commons. He wanted changes such as Catholic Emancipation and more self government for the kingdom. He did not believe that Ireland and Great Britain should become a single country. He was one of the people who were most important in creating the constitution of 1782. This gave Ireland self-government. He was also important in ending Poynings law of 1494 and the Declaratory Act of 1720. 

Turkey at the Olympics

Turkey sent athletes to the Olympic Games for the first time in 1908. It has sent athletes to of the Summer Olympic Games since then. Turkey has been a part of most Winter Olympic Games since their first in 1936. Turkish athletes have won a total of 82 medals. They have won 37 golds, 23 silvers and 22 bronzes. Turkey won the most medals in wrestling.

The National Olympic Committee for Turkey was created in 1908. It was accepted by the IOC in 1911. Istanbul wants to host the 2020 Summer Olympics.



Ukraine at the Olympics

Ukraine sent athletes to the Olympic Games for the first time as an independent nation in 1994. It has sent athletes to every Summer Olympic Games and Winter Olympic Games since then.

Before 1994, Ukrainian athletes were a part of the Soviet Union at the Olympics from 1952 to 1988. After the Soviet Union ended, Ukraine was part of the Unified Team in 1992.

Ukraine has won a total of 116 medals at the Summer Games and five at the Winter Games. Gymnastics has been the nation's best sport.

The National Olympic Committee of Ukraine was created in 1990. It was accepted by the International Olympic Committee in 1993.



Serbia and Montenegro at the Olympics

The former state union of Serbia and Montenegro sent athletes to the Olympic Games seven times between 1992 and 2006. After that, Montenegro and Serbia became separate countries.

Yugoslavia had sent athletes to every Summer Olympic Games from 1920–1988. They sent athletes to all but two Winter Olympic Games between 1924–1988. Because of the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991 and 1992, their part in the Olympics changed. Croatia and Slovenia sent their own athletes to the 1992 Winter Olympics. The team from Yugoslavia was made up of athletes from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. This was the last Games for the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was created in April 1992. It included the Republic of Montenegro and the Republic of Serbia. In May of 1992, the United Nations Security Council said that all nations should not let the FR of Yugoslavia take part in any international sports. The International Olympic Committee said that athletes from Serbia and Montenegro (and also Macedonia) could still take part in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. The athletes had to be Independent Olympic Participants (IOP), wear plan white clothing and use the Olympic Anthem and Olympic flag during the events. They could not be a part of the opening and closing ceremonies of the games.
A team of 52 athletes took part in events. They won three medals in shooting. The athletes could only take part in the game as individuals. No teams were allowed. This meant that the men's water polo team, the women's basketball team, and the men's and women's handball teams could not compete.

No athletes were allowed to take part in any way in the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. The country was allowed to send athletes to the next Olympiad.

At the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, the team of 68 athletes took part in 13 sports and won four medals. In Sydney for the 2000 Summer Olympics, the "Yugoslavia" team had 111 athletes in 14 sports and won three medals.

In 2003, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia became the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. The nation was named "Serbia and Montenegro" (SCG) for the first time at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. The team of 87 athletes competed in 14 sports and won two silver medals.

In 2006, the state union ended. Each nation became independent. The NOC for Serbia and Montenegro became the Olympic Committee of Serbia in June 2006. The Montenegrin Olympic Committee was accepted by the IOC in July 2007.
Montenegro and Serbia participated independently for the first time at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.



Magnetic flux

Magnetic flux is a measure of the magnetic field lines passing through a surface, such as a loop of wire. The magnetic flux through a closed surface such as a sphere is always zero, because the magnetic field lines going into the closed surface are balanced by field lines coming out.

It is the alignment of electrons in the atomic shells of ferromagnets and the “spinning” electrons in electromagnets, that provides a material with it’s magnetism.

The SI unit of magnetic flux is the Weber (Wb; in derived units, volt-seconds). The CGS unit is the Maxwell.

Magnetic flux is sometimes used by electrical engineers designing systems with electromagnets or designing dynamos. Physicists designing particle accelerators also calculate magnetic flux.



Emperor Tenji

, also known as Emperor Tenchi, was the 38th Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. His reign started in 661 and ended in 671.

Before he became the monarch, his personal name ("imina") was .

He was the son of Emperor Jomei.

Prince Naka no Ōe was made heir apparent and Crown Prince in 661.


Prince Ōtomo (Ōtomo"-shinnō") was the favorite son of Emperor Tenji; and he was also the first to be accorded the title of "Daijō-daijin."
Tenji improved the military forces which had been established during the Taika reforms.

The actual site of Tenji's grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Yamashina-ku, Kyoto.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Tenji's mausoleum. It is formally named "Yamashina no misasagi".


Fess Parker

Fess Elisha Parker, Jr. (August 16, 1924 – March 18, 2010), was an American actor.

His first movie was "Harvey" (1950) with James Stewart. Over the years, he worked on movies with many well known actors. These include Gary Cooper, Bob Hope, Jeff Chandler and Steve McQueen.

Fess Parker work for Disney on two movies about Davy Crockett In 1964, NBC hired him to do a television series about Daniel Boone. The series was about the Boone and his fights against the Indians and the redcoats in the American Revolution. The cast of the series included of Patricia Blair as Rebecca Boone, Albert Salmi as Yadkin, Ed Ames as Mingo, Roosevelt Grier as Gabe Cooper and Darby Hinton is Israel Boone. 159 episodes were made between 1964-1970.


Soviet Union at the Olympics

The Soviet Union sent athletes to the Olympic Games for the first time in 1952. They sent teams to the Games 18 simes since then. At seven of its nine times at the Summer Olympic Games, the team ranked first in the total number of medals won. It was ranked second at the other two Games. The team was ranked first in the medal count seven times and second twice in nine times they sent teams to the Winter Olympic Games.

"The Olympic Committee of the USSR" was created on April 21, 1951. It was accepted by the IOC on May 7, 1951. 

The 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki was first Olympic Games for Soviet athletes. On July 20, 1952, the first Olympic gold medal for the country was won by Nina Romashkova in the women's discus throw. Romashkova set the new Olympic record in the event. The 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo were the first Winter Olympic Games for Soviet athletes. The first Winter Olympic gold medal for the Soviet Union was won by Lyubov Kozyreva in women's cross-country skiing 10 km event. 

The USSR was the host nation for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. These Games were boycotted by the United States and many other countries. After this, the USSR led a boycott of the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.

The USSR ended on December 26, 1991. "The Olympic Committee of the USSR" did not end until March 12, 1992.

In 1992, 12 of the 15 countries that had been part of the Soviet Union took part in the Games as the Unified Team. They used the Olympic Flag in the Barcelona Games. The Unified Team finished first in the medal rankings. The Unified Team also competed at the Albertville Winter Games earlier in the year. Only seven of the twelve countries took part. They finished second in the medal ranking at those Games.




To Catch a Predator

To Catch a Predator is a television program designed to catch adults trying to have sex with children below the age of 16. People were lured to meet with a decoy under the pretense of sexual contact and then confronted. Show host Chris Hansen clarified in an interview with NPR News that these subjects should be labeled as potential sexual predators, and not pedophiles. "Pedophiles have a very specific definition, people who are interested in prepubescent sex," he stated. 

The series premiered in November 2004, and featured 12 investigations in total held across the United States. The investigations were conducted as undercover sting operations with the help of on-line watchdog group Perverted-Justice. Since the third installment, law enforcement and other officials were also involved, leading to the arrests of most individuals caught. No new episodes have aired since December 2007.

Rockwall County, Texas assistant district attorney Louis Conradt was caught sending pictures and messages to who he thought was a 13-year-old boy but was decoy from Perverted-Justice. When they tried to do a search warrant to his house, Conradt would commit suicide by shooting himself while the police and NBC crew were entering his house. The show would be cancelled afterwards.

NBC affiliates WTMJ in Milwaukee, KSHB in Kansas City and WBRE have also done local versions of "To Catch a Predator". Various spin-offs have aired in the same format, including "To Catch a Con Man", "To Catch an ID Thief", "To Catch a Car Thief" and "To Catch an i-Jacker", which featured iPod thieves. "To Catch a Predator" is also aired on FX and Crime & Investigation Network in the United Kingdom, the Crime & Investigation Network in Australia and New Zealand and FOX Crime in Portugal.

Later in 2016, Chris Hansen would host a similar segment called "Hansen vs. Predator" during episodes of "Crime Watch Daily".

Jahbulon

Jahbulon (or Jabulon) is a word, or a confection of three syllables, that was used in the past in some rituals of certain parts of Masonry. It is also said to be used in Ordo Templi Orientis rituals.

The origin and meaning of this word are not completely known. Different groups think the word means different things. Even Masonic researchers do not all agree to what the word means or where it came from. One Masonic scholar says that the word was first used in an early 18th century Royal Arch ritual. He said it was the name of an explorer looking for King Solomon's Temple. Another Masonic scholar thinks it is a name for God in Hebrew. The most used Masonic explanation is that it is a word that comes from putting together parts of the name of God in different historic languages.

Writers who are not Masons, especially those against Masonry, have said that it is a Masonic name for God. Some say it is the name of a unique "Masonic God". Freemasonry's officials have said many times that ""There is no separate Masonic God"". They have also said that there is no separate proper name for a deity in any branch of Freemasonry. This meaning of the word has caused many religious groups to argue about and condemn Freemasonry. In England, no ritual with the name has been in official Masonic use since February 1989. Stephen Knights, author of The Brotherhood:The Secret World of the Freemasons, says it is a trinity composed of three ancient Middle Eastern Gods, Jah, God of the Jews, Baal, God of the Phoenicians, and On, an Egyptian God.

After persistent strong criticism in the popular press, the Supreme Grand Chapter of England excised the word from its Royal Arch ritual in 1989, and replaced it with a choice between two forms of the tetragrammaton.

Yugoslavia at the Olympics

Yugoslavia sent athletes to the Olympic Games for the first time in 1920. Before this, several athletes from Croatia, Slovenia and Vojvodina were on the Olympic teams of Austria or Hungary when those countries were part of the Empire of Austria-Hungary. A small team of two athletes been sent from the Serbia to the 1912 Summer Olympics.

"Yugoslavia" has been the name for Olympic teams from three distinct nations:

Two of the nations that were at one time part of Yugoslavia, (Croatia and Slovenia), started sending their own teams to the Olympics at the 1992 Winter Olympics. As of the 2008 Summer Olympics, all six former parts of Yugoslavia were sending their own teams to the Games.

These tables do not include "Yugoslavia" teams representing the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).



Sex linkage

Sex linkage is a term in genetics. It applies to alleles (forms of a gene) on the X chromosome.

In mammals, which have an XX/XY system of sex determination, the X chromosome has many more genes than the Y chromosome. This explains the inheritance of such conditions as colour blindness and haemophilia. They are caused by recessive alleles, and usually do not show the condition in females. This is because those females carrying the mutant are most likely to be heterozygous for the allele. However, if the mutant allele is carried by a male, the condition will develop, because his X chromosome has the mutant allele, but his Y chromosome has no allele at that locus.

Sex-linked characters controlled by genes on sex chromosomes are not the only kind of sex-related characters.

Sex-influenced or sex-conditioned traits are phenotypes affected by whether they appear in a male or female body. Even in a homozygous female the condition may not be expressed fully. Example: baldness in humans.

These are characters only expressed in one sex. They may be caused by genes on either autosomal or sex chromosomes. Examples: female sterility in "Drosophila"; and polymorphism in insects, especially in relation to mimicry. Closely linked genes on autosomes called "supergenes" are often responsible for the latter.

Telenovela

A telenovela, or simply novela, is a serial drama television program. It is popular in Latin American, Portuguese, and Spanish television programming. Telenovelas are different from soap operas, because unlike soap operas, telenovelas have an ending and do not run for many years. They usually come to an end after one television season (which is usually less than one year) or at most two television seasons (which is less than two years). Telenovelas rarely run more than two seasons. The telenovela combines drama with the 19th century "feuilleton" and the Latin American radionovela. They are often used to give cultural messages by adding them into storylines.

Because the telenovela is similar to the American soap opera, the telenovela is often called a "Spanish soap opera" in the United States. While most English language soap operas have no ending, almost all telenovelas run for a limited time. They are usually shown five or six days a week and run for an average of 120 episodes.

Arriva London

Operations are split between two registered companies, Arriva London North Limited and Arriva London South Limited.

Arriva London North Limited operates nine bus garages.


Arriva London South Limited operate four bus garages.



Harold Camping

Harold Egbert Camping (July 19, 1921 – December 15, 2013) was an American Christian radio broadcaster. His parents were Dutch immigrants. He served as president of Family Radio, a California-based radio station group that broadcasts to more than 150 markets in the United States, since 1958. In 2011 he retired from active broadcasting following a stroke, but maintained a role at Family Radio until his death. Camping is notable for applying numerology to his interpretations of Bible passages in an attempt to predict dates for the End Times. 

His 2011 end times prediction was that on May 21, 2011 Jesus Christ would return to Earth, the righteous would fly up to heaven, and that there would follow five months of fire, brimstone and plagues on Earth, with millions of people dying each day, culminating on October 21, 2011 with the end of the world. He had previously predicted judgment days on May 21, 1988, and September 6, 1994.

His prediction for May 21, 2011 was widely reported, in part because of a massive publicity campaign by Family Radio, and it prompted responses from both atheist and Christian organizations. After May 21 passed without the predicted incidents, Camping said he believed that a "spiritual" judgment had occurred on that date, and that the physical Rapture would occur on October 21, 2011, simultaneously with the destruction of the universe by God. Except for one press appearance on May 23, 2011, Camping largely avoided press interviews after May 21, particularly after he suffered a stroke in June. October 21, 2011, passed without the predicted apocalypse, leading the International Business Times to proclaim Camping a "false prophet." 

Camping was reported to have retired from his position at Family Radio as of October 16, 2011, only days before his last predicted date for the end of the world. However, his daughter later clarified that he had not retired outright, but was maintaining a role at the Family Radio while working from home. Camping admitted in a private interview that he no longer believed that anybody could know the time of the Rapture or the end of the world, in stark contrast to his previously staunch position on the subject.

Santana Formation

The Santana Formation is a high quality fossil site in Brazil 115 to 108 million years ago (mya). It is in northeastern Brazil's Araripe Basin. It qualifies as a Lagerstätte, which means it is one of the best fossil sites, with many undisturbed fossils.

The strata come from the Lower Cretaceous, laid down about 92 million years ago in a shallow inland sea.

Some 25 species of fish are found, many with stomach contents preserved. This lets palaeontologists study predator–prey relationships in the ecosystem. There are also fine examples of pterosaurs, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates (especially insects) and plants. Even dinosaurs are found here: a new maniraptor was described in 1996.

Limestone nodules formed around dead organisms; this preserved even the soft parts of their anatomy. The limestone was etched away using a mild acid. The fossils were then preserved by the 'transfer technique' which means they were embedded in a plastic resin such as polyester or epoxy.

The nearby Crato Formation is also a lagerstätte. It was produced in similar conditions, about 10 million years before the Santana Formation.

Various remains of non-avian theropods, avialans, ornithischians, and possibly oviraptorosaurs have been found in Estado do Ceara, Brazil. Examples are spinosaurs like "Irritator" and maniraptors like "Santanaraptor".

"Ornithocheirus" and "Tupuxuara" are examples. The inland sea also had turtles, such as "Santanachelys".

Coit Tower

Coit Tower is a tower in the Telegraph Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, California. The tower, in the city's Pioneer Park, was built in 1933. Lillie Hitchcock Coit left one-third of her estate to the city "to be expended in an appropriate manner for the purpose of adding to the beauty of the city which I have always loved".

The art deco tower is made of unpainted reinforced concrete. Architects Arthur Brown, Jr. and Henry Howard designed it. The tower has fresco murals by 27 different on-site artists and their assistants, plus two additional paintings installed after creation off-site.

The tower was not designed to resemble a fire hose nozzle, despite Coit's affinity with the San Francisco firefighters of the day, in particular with Knickerbocker Engine Company Number 5.
