The first contact with Europeans was in 1609. Henry Hudson reached the area with his "Half Boot" ship. One officer of the "Half Boot" wrote about the Wappinger. He said the Wappinger brought goods to these first Europeans. He also said they were well dressed and wore furs and skins. The colonist David Pieterz De Vries wrote that the Wappinger had facial paints, wore animal skins and had long black hair. 

The Dutch convinced the Eastern Wappinger to sell their lands. The Dutch killed many Wappinger in the Pavonia Massacre (1643) The rest of the Wappinger resisted the Dutch. They fought the Dutch in Kieft's War (1643-1645). In 1644, the Dutch killed more than 500 Wappinger in the Pound Ridge Massacre. The Dutch were allied with the Mohawks and defeated the Wappinger in 1645.

In 1655, the Wappinger fought the Dutch in the short Peach Tree War (1655). After this war, many Wappinger left their territories and the confederation fell apart. They went to Stockbridge, Massachusetts. This was a praying town. These were towns that colonists created to convert Natives to Christianity. 

The Dutch Philipse Family purchased land from the chiefs of the Wappinger. This land was bought in the Philipse Patent. Wappinger sued to get the land back. They did not get their land back. 

Daniel Ninham (1726-1778) was the last chief (sachem) of the Wappinger. He went to England to the king. He asked for land rights and better treatement of Natives. The English had some understanding for the chief. However, they did not give land. The treatment of the Natives also did not change. 

Daniel Nimham and Wappinger supported Americans in the American Revolution. After the war, the Wappinger moved to Oneida County, New York. They were with the Mohican and Oneida people. Later Wappinger mostly intermarried. 

In the 19th century, the Wappinger were forced to leave their land and move to Wisconsin. This is now a reservation for the Stockbridge-Munsee Nation. The US Government recognizes this nation. The tribe runs casino business here.

The following is a list of the Wappinger bands and their present-day locations. 


Domestication of animals

During the Neolithic period humans started domesticating animals. Remains of animal bones at Neolithic sites tells us what animals were domesticated. with the domestication of animals like oxen, pigs and sheep, there was a regular supply of meat and the herders were able to keep well fed.

Dogs were first domesticated by hunters and gatherers of wild food plants in Central Asia at least 15,000 years ago. This was the first successful domestication of animals, including goats, cattle, and other species, as well as plants.

Animal domestication in the Neolithic period, like plant domestication, involved artificial selection: how humans bred certain species based on the characteristics they desired to pass on to the next generation. In this way, humans domesticated dogs, sheep, goats, and cattle, which over time became distinct from their wild ancestors and relatives.

Daniel Nimham

Daniel Nimham (also Ninham) (1726–1778) was the last chief (sachem) of the Wappinger Native Americans. Ninham learned English and served in the British military during King George's War. He moved to Stockbridge, Massachusetts by 1758. He often returned to Dutchess County, New York. This was where his ancestors had lived. He went to courts to defend the rights of Natives. In a New York Court, Ninham argued that Adolphus Philipse's purchase of Wappinger land was fraud. He and other chiefs went to England to get back this land and to fight for his cause. Ninham was a soldier for the Americans in the American Revolution. He was part of the Stockbridge Militia. His son Abraham Nimham led this militia. This was a Native American militia. Today, there are many sites named after Ninham and a few statues of Ninham in New York.

Network mapping

Network mapping is the study of the physical connectivity of the Internet. Network mapping discovers the devices on the network and their connectivity. 

The field of automated network mapping has taken more importance. This is because networks become more dynamic and complex in nature.

Recent efforts to map the internet have been improved by more sophisticated methods. It allows them to make faster and more sensible maps. 

The sizing and layout of the autonomous systems was calculated based on their centrality. It is a measure of how central to the network each autonomous system is.

Many organizations create network maps of their network system. These maps can be made manually using simple tools such as Microsoft Visio. The mapping process can be simplified by using tools that integrate auto network discovery with Network mapping. One such example being the Fabric platform. Many of the vendors from the Notable network mappers list enable you to customize the maps. It also include your own labels, add un-discoverable items and background images.

Netflix Animation

Netflix Animation is a animation studio owned by Netflix. It makes animated movies and television series.

When Netflix started making animated movies and television series in 2013, they got a lot of help from other animation companies (usually DreamWorks). Since 2018, Netflix can make them without relying on other companies. Some of the first projects they made are the movie "Klaus" and the series "Kid Cosmic".

Things got complicated with how the company was running animation, so Netflix fired the Creative Director Phil Rynda, as well as canceled several projects. Many others left for other studios after this, including Mike Moon (who was leading the department of animation for adults) who moved to start his own company with Illumination.

Netflix was about to buy the Australian animation studio Animal Logic in July 2022, when Melissa Cobb stopped being vice president of movie animation (Karen Toliver took her place) and stayed on the studio as a producer.

In September 2022, Netflix Animation fired 30 people to try and make things more efficient.

Pseudacris kalmi

The New Jersey chorus frog or Cope's tree frog ("Pseudacris kalmi") is a frog. It lives in the United States. It lives in New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia.

This frog is 19–36 mm long from nose to rear end. It is gray, brown, or green in color with a stripe that goes from over the mouth to under the eye. It has three thick stripes over its back from front to back.

This frog lives in places that are wet but not too wet: Flooded places, forests with ditches and vernal pools and patches of water, and in freshwater swamps.

When it is time to lay eggs, the male frogs go to vernal pools. These are patches of water made by spring rain and melting snow. They are only there in the spring. They dry up during the summer. The male frogs sing at the pool, and then the female frogs come to them. The female frog lays eggs on the stems of plants in shallow water. The eggs stick together in groups of 8 to 143. The tadpoles swim and grow for two months before becoming frogs.

Swimming snakes, foxes, birds, and raccoons all catch and eat this frog. So do animals with bony skins such as crayfish and spiders.

Scientists named this frog "kalmi" for Pehr Kalm, also called Peter Kalm. Kalm was a Swedish explorer who wrote a book called "Travels into North America" in 1772. He wrote about this frog in the book.

Anglo-Powhatan Wars

The Anglo–Powhatan Wars were three wars between the Powhatan People and English colonists of Virginia. The first war went from 1609 to 1614. The second war was from 1622 to 1626. The third war was from 1644 until 1646. The last war ended with the death of Opechancanough. The Powhatan eventually were defeated and lost a lot of land. 

The English settled in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. The Chief Powhatan wanted the English colonists to leave the land. Captain John Smith was exploring the land. The Powhatan captured him, but he was eventually released. Smith wanted to build several forts close to the Powhatan people. Powhatan tribes attacked English forts in Jamestown, Virginia. Later Powhatans killed Captain John Ratcliffe and several colonists. The English responded with harsh conditions and more violence. 

The first war was from 1609 to 1614. English attacked and mostly destroyed the town of Paspahegh. They killed the queen and several children. The English captured an island from the Arrohattocs. The Appomattoc attacked the English in 1610. In 1611, the English captured Appomattoc. In December 1612, the English attacked Patawomeck and captured Pocahontas. She was the daughter of Powhatan. The Powhatan stopped fighting to get her back. English colonists continued to expand into Weyanoke, Appomattoc, Arrohattoc, and Powhatan territory. 

The English found Powhatan and created a peace agreement. Pocahantas would marry John Rolfe. This peace lasted for several years. 

Opechancanough (the younger brother of Powhatan) and his warriors attacked Jamestown in 1622. They killed many colonists. This event was the Jamestown Massacre or Indian massacre of 1622. The English had a quick and strong response. They were allies with the Accomac and Patawomeck. These tribes provided corn. The English attacked the Chickahominy, Appamattoc, Nansemond, Warraskoyack, Weyanoke, and Pamunkey. Opechancanough asked for peace. However, the English tricked and poisoned the Natives. The colonists had a shortage of gunfire from 1625-1626. The English attacked several tribes again in Summer 1627. There was a short time of peace in 1628. However, fighting continued until 1632. The English colonists expanded their land more. The English also created a fence barrier (palisade) to stop Native attacks. 

There were ten years of peace before the third war. Opechancanough led the fight this time in 1644. He and his men killed many colonists. Governor William Berkeley led an attack to capture Opechancanough. The English were successful. Opechancanough was killed in captivity in October 1646. Necotowance had replaced him as chief of the Powhatan Confederacy. 

The General Assembly of Virginia and Necotowance signed a peace treaty in October 1646. Natives had to give payments to the Virginia governor. The English created a frontier line. It racially separated Naives from English. The treaty also expanded English land.

International Philosophy Olympiad

The International Philosophy Olympiad (IPO) is one of the International Olympiads for high-school pupils. It first took place in 1993, by an initiative of the Department of Philosophy of Sofıa University to invite a group of philosophers from various countries. Since 2001 the IPO has been organized under the auspices of FISP and with the recognition and support of UNESCO.

The objectives of the IPO are:


The IPO is organized every year in May, by one of the participating countries. Participation in IPO will require a commitment on the part of the national delegations to promote the study of Philosophy in their home country and to organize a national competition in Philosophy.

The IPO is open to pupils from every country in the world who are enrolled in high school, either at the time of the competition, or, in countries where the school year ends in December in the year before, or earlier than May the same year, even if they are enrolled at a university at the time of the IPO.

The maximum age of a pupil is 20.

The National Organizing Committee of the host country may decide to adopt a leading theme of the Olympiad. Such a theme, however, will be used only for the series of lectures and workshops offered to the participants and should not be reflected in the selection of contest topics. The contest topics should reflect a variety of philosophical disciplines.

Each country can participate with one or two pupils, with the exception of the host country, which may participate with a maximum of 10 pupils.

The selection of the pupils who will participate in an IPO is made after competitions organized at the national level; but in exceptional cases other methods may be followed subject to the approval of the Steering Board. These national competitions should be organized by, or under the auspices of, a national philosophical society which is a member of FISP. If a national society does not exist or if, though it exists, it is not willing to organize the national Olympiads, or if another method has been pursued in the past, other procedures may be followed, but in all cases these procedures are subject to the approval of the Steering Board of the IPOs.

a) Before March 1 of the year of the competition, each delegation leader is expected to send one proposal of a topic to the Secretary General of FISP. This proposal (a short quotation – not longer than five lines – or a question) must be submitted in at least one of the IPO languages and it must include the correct source. These proposals will be circulated among the FISP members of the Steering Board, who will select four topics from among those sent and/or other topics of their choice. The topics selected will be printed in all four IPO languages.

They will be provided with the sources according to academic rules. Quotations will be provided in the best available translation, and with bibliographic data according to academic standards. If no good translation(s) is (are) available, the Secretary General of FISP will provide (a) new translation(s), mentioning the translator(s) by name.

b) Writing the Essays

I. Every student writes an essay on one of the four topics given to them.

II. The essay must be written in one of the following languages: English, German, French, Spanish; however, it must not be written in the official language(s) of the student’s state (e.g., a German does not write in German).

The only aid that may be used during the students´ essay-writing are bi-lingual dictionaries in the pupils´ own language and one of the official IPO languages (English/German/French/Spanish), and mono-lingual dictionaries in one of the official IPO languages. Such dictionaries must be in paper versions, not in any electronic format.

III. The time of writing is 4 hours.

IV. The names of the authors of all essays are encoded and not known to the assessors until the final ranking is fixed.

c) Grading the essays

I. The criteria of evaluation are: relevance to the topic, philosophical understanding of the topic, persuasive power of argumentation, coherence, and originality.

II. Each assessor gives his or her marks on a scale of 1 to 10 points, from 7 points upwards using intervals of .5.



III. At the first stage of the grading each essay is marked by four assessors. If there are more than 3 points of difference among the individual marks, a fifth assessor will be appointed. At the end of the first stage all the essays which have received an average grade of at least 7 points are selected for the second stage.

IV. At the second stage each remaining essay is marked by two additional assessors.

The average mark of an essay is calculated on the basis of all the marks it has received – both the marks of the assessors at the first stage and the marks of the two assessors at the second stage. At the end of the second stage the Jury of the IPO selects as many of the best essays as it wishes for consideration in the third stage.

V. At the third stage the Steering Board will decide on the distribution or prizes.

Oneida people

The Oneida people (autonym: Onʌyoteˀa·ká·, Onyota'a:ka) are a Native American and First Nation tribe. They were part of the Iroquois Confederacy. Their name means "People of the Standing Stone". The Oneida, Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca were the first tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy. The Oneida lived in upstate New York and around the Great Lakes. There are four tribes today. The US government recognizes the Oneida Indian Nation in New York and the Oneida Nation in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Canada recognizes the Six Nations of the Grand River and Oneida Nation of the Thames in Ontario, Canada.

The Oneida had large amounts of land before colonists came. The Oneida and the Iroquois Confederacy had to give up lands in several treaties with the United States. These treaties created new boundaries for Native lands. The Iroquois signed Treaties of Fort Stanwix in 1764 and 1784. In these treaties, the Iroquois had to give up lands in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, West Virginia, and New York.

The Oneida people are known for supporting the Americans in the American Revolution. Oneida were first neutral during the American Revolution. Most eventually supported the Americans. The Mohawks supported the British and attacked the Oneida. Polly Cooper helped American troops at Valley Forge. Chief Skenandon and his people brought food to the troops in 1777.

After the war, the Iroquois got back lands in the Treaty of Canandaigua (1794). This treaty created peace and friendship between the United States and the Iroquois. However, the Americans took back these lands. They had contact with Quakers in New York. The Oneida broke up into groups. There were disagreements with Quakers about lands and missions.

In the early 19th century, the Oneida did not have land and moved to Wisconsin. Chief Daniel Bread helped with the Treaty in Wisconsin (1838).

The main food was corn (agriculture). The tribe farmed the Three Sisters (corn, beans, squash). There were different foods for different seasons. Fall foods included dried fruits, nuts, wild rice. They ate more fatty foods before the winter. Meats included deer, geese, duck and raccoon. In the spring Oneida ate wild onions, leeks, milkweeds, dandelions and maple candy. They also did fishing in the spring. The summer foods included fruits like strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, pears, plums, peaches, apples, and grapes.

The tribe lived in longhouses. There were about 60 to 100 longhouses in the Oneida Nation. There were individual clans. The three clans of the Oneida Nation are turtle, wolf, and bear.

The Oneida nation had a tribal council. Mothers played an important role in decisions. The Oneida were matrilineal. This means descent and family was through the mother. Men did hunting and fishing. Women prepared food, cooked and cleaned.

Clothing had meaning in the Oneida culture. Clothing included clan symbols. Oneida wore animal skins. When European settlers came, they wore more cotton and cloths clothing. Women wore headbands with many beads. Men wore a "kastoweh" or feathered hat.

The tribe had social and ceremonial dancing. Social dancing was public. Examples included round dance, rabbit dance, old moccasin dance and canoe or fishing dance. Ceremonial dancing was sacred and more private. Ceremonial dances included Maple Syrup, Strawberry, Bean, Sun and Moon dances. Ceremonial dancing included singing.

Commutation Act

The Commutation Act of 1784 was a law passed in Britain to lower tariffs on tea. An academic article on the act begins by stating: "By lowering duties so as to remove the incentive for smuggling, the Commutation Act of 1784 marks a turning-point in the history of British tea trade."
Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger had led the effort to get the law passed. He had been supported by tea dealers. The law also affected the monopolistic power of the legal importer, the East India Company, giving domestic dealers more power in the trade. 

Treaties of Fort Stanwix

The Treaties of Fort Stanwix (1768, 1784) were treaties between Iroquois Confederacy and British and Americans. The Iroquois gave up lands in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, West Virginia, and New York. The first treaty (1768) was between the Iroquois and the British. It created the "Line of Property" between Iroquois tribes and the Thirteen colonies. Colonists and the Penn Family got lands in Pennsylvania. This changed the former Royal Proclamation of 1763. The second treaty (1784) was after the American Revolution and between the Iroquois and the United States. Americans wanted to expand westward. They realized that the Line of Property was not enough. This treaty weakened the Iroquois.


Treaty of Canandaigua

The Treaty of Canandaigua or Pickering Treaty or the Calico Treaty (1794) was a treaty between the Iroquois Confederacy and the United States. The treaty was signed after the American Revolution. Sachems (chiefs) signed the treaty for the Iroquois. Notable Iroquois include Cornplanter, Handsome Lake, Little Beard, Red Jacket and Farmer's Brother. Timothy Pickering signed the treaty for the United States. The treaty created peace between the Iroquois and the United States. The treaty was meant to resolve conflict. The Iroquois were not happy that the United States got land from Britain after the American Revolution. The Iroquois said no to the Fort Harmar and Fort Stanwix treaties. The Iroquois and United States had a conference for several months from September to November. The treaty said Americans couldn't take lands of the Iroquois. It acknowleged lands owned by Oneida and Seneca people. The US would also give money to the Iroquois each year.

CableCARD

CableCARD is a special PC Card device. It allows consumers in the United States to view and record digital cable television channels on digital video recorders and personal computers. 

It is also done in television sets on equipment such as a set-top box not provided by a cable television company. The card is generally provided by the local cable operator, typically for a nominal monthly fee.

A 2020 FCC decision removed the requirement for cable companies to provide CableCARDs. However they are still required to provide consumer access options via "separable security".

"CableCARD" is a term trademarked by CableLabs for the Point of Deployment (POD) module defined by standards including SCTE 28, SCTE 41, CEA-679 and others. The physical CableCARD is inserted into a slot in the host (typically a digital television set or a set-top box) in order to identify and authorize the customer. 

It is also to provide decoding of the encrypted digital cable signal without the need for a proprietary set-top box. The cable tuner, QAM demodulator, and MPEG decoder are part of the host equipment. .

Interactive features such as video on demand depends on the CableCARD Host device being an OpenCable Host Device. They have nothing to do with the physical card. This makes the common use of the phrase "CableCARD 2.0" as a requirement for video on demand misleading.

The physical CableCARD is a PC Card type II. It handles decryption of video. It also ensures that only authorized subscribers may view it. This is also known as a "conditional-access module" function.

No actual M-Cards were released before the introduction of CableCARD 2.0, which combined and enhanced the CableCARD 1.0 and Multi-Stream standards.

Integrated cable set-top boxes perform four basic functions:


New digital televisions and other devices that are labeled "DCR" (Digital cable ready) contain:

CableCARDs were adopted outside the United States, only in South Korea, in pair with Nagravision and VideoGuard conditional access (CA) systems. U.S. adoptions of CableCARD were mostly paired with Cisco's "PowerKEY" (originally developed by Scientific Atlanta) and Motorola's (now Arris) "MediaCipher" CA systems.


RF modulator

An RF modulator (or radio frequency modulator) is an electronic device. Its input is a baseband signal. It is used to modulate a radio frequency source.

Before the introduction of specialised video connector standards such as SCART, TVs were designed to only accept signals through the aerial connector. When equipment was developed which could use a television receiver as its display device, the signal was modulated and sent to the RF input connector.

RF modulators are now largely a third-party product. It is purchased primarily to run newer equipment such as DVD players with an old television set.

RF modulation puts the desired information on to a carrier signal at a standardized frequency. Amplitude or frequency modulation may be used, as required by the receiving equipment.

Even some units that have two or more audio inputs simply combine the left and right audio channels into one mono audio signal.

RF modulators produce a relatively poor picture. This is because the image quality is lost during both the modulation from the source device, and the demodulation in the television.

RF modulators are commonly integrated into VCRs and video game consoles up to the fourth generation, and in 8- and 16-bit home computers.

RF modulators may also be used to take the audio and video signal from a PAL or NTSC composite video, RGB, YUV or other composite AV source. It also generate a broadcast RF signal that can be fed into a television's aerial/coaxial connector.

Hello Kitty murder case

The Hello Kitty murder case was the murder of Fanin Hong Kong. Man-yee lived in an orphanage until she was 15, when she was kicked out because no one wanted to take her. She became homeless and got addicted to drugs. Eventually, she became a street prostitute and when she turned 21, she joined a brothel. Fan married a fellow addict, who was also her client in 1996. She gave birth to a boy in 1998. Man-yee's husband was abusive, as claimed by their neighbors.

A triad member named Chan Man-lok (34 years old) was a regular client of Fan Man-yee. In early 1999, Fan Man-yee stole about $4000 HK ($500) from Man-lok. When she got caught, she immediately returned the wallet. But, when Chan Man-lok asked for an extra $HK 10,000 from her, she said that she needed more time to get the money. The kidnapping took place on 17th March, 1999.

She was kidnapped by 3 men and a young girl, Ah Fong who was groomed by Chan Man-lok. They took her to an apartment in Tsim Sha Tsui (No. 31 Granville Road) and imprisoned her for a month until her death.

She was raped and tortured and was beaten with household items and was also used as a punching bag. She was also kicked in the head (around 50 times). Her legs and feet were burned with wax and hot plastic which made her unable to walk. She was also forced to consume Ah Fong's feces and the men's urine. And, if she was refusing, she would be beaten more. She was forced to smile and say that she had enjoyed the abuse. Eventually, she died because of traumatic shock on 15th April 1999. Her body was dismembered and boiled, and her head was shoved into a Hello Kitty doll, providing a title for this case. Only her skull, one tooth and few internal organs remained.

Ah Fong told the police about this after she had been seeing the image of a young woman in her 20s haunting her, which she assumed was Fan Man-yee. The people who allegedly abused her repeatedly were Leung Wai-Lun (21), Leung Shing-cho (27), Chan Man-Lok (34) and his grooming victim, Ah Fong (14). After a six-week long trial, the three men were convicted of manslaughter due to the jury's inability to judge whether her death was due to a drug overdose or murder. But, they sentenced the men because their abuse had a role in her death. Ah Fong testified in trial as an exchange for immunity.

Justice Peter Nguyen states that Hong Kong had never heard of a more gruesome crime, and the psychiatric reports marked the three as 'remorseless'. There was no review for parole for 20 years, until 2020.

Pseudacris fouquettei

The Cajun chorus frog ("Pseudacris fouquettei") is a frog. It lives in the United States. It lives in all of Louisiana and parts of Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Mississippi.

The largest adult male frogs are 30 mm long from nose to rear end and the smallest adult female frogs are 27 mm long. Adults are light brown or pink-brown in color with three darker brown stripes on their backs. Some have lines of spots instead of stripes. Some have neither. The iris of the eye is gold in color. There is a red-brown stripe from the nose all the way to the back legs. The skin of the belly is lighter in color with some dark marks. The throat can be yellow-brown in color. This frog mostly looks for food during the day.

The female frog lays 500 to 1500 eggs at a time. The eggs stick to plants.

The adult frogs do not go far from the water. They eat small animals without bones, for example, beetles, ants, and flies. Scientists think the tadpoles eat algae and dead plants. Some animals eat the tadpoles, for example spiders and beetles. Small snakes, for example garter snakes eat the adult frogs. Scientists think birds, turtles, and some mammals might eat this frog too. They have never seen what the frog does to try to get away.

This frog is not in danger of dying out, but there are fewer of them than there were in the past. This is because of humans build things where the frogs would live and because of disease.

This frog is closely related to "Pseudacris nigrita" and these frogs can have young together. The hybrid frogs, which have one "P. nigrita" parent and one "P. foquettei" parent, are healthy. Scientists think the two species may be joining together.

Seneca people

The Seneca () (Seneca: "Onödowáʼga:", "Great Hill People") are Iroquois Native Americans. They lived around Lake Ontario. They are part of the Northeastern Woodlands culture. They speak the Seneca language. This language is part of the Iroquoian language family. The Seneca were one of the Six Nations or Iroquois League. They are the most westerly nation of the Iroquois. They were next to the Cayuga. They were also the largest nation of the Iroquois. The US government recognizes three tribes today. They are the Seneca Nation of Indians (New York), the Tonawanda Seneca Nation (New York) and the Seneca-Cayuga Nation (Oklahoma). About 10,000 Seneca natives live in the United States and 1,000 in Canada.

The Seneca were originally from New York State. They joined the Iroquois Confederacy in the 12th century. The Seneca had the largest population of the Iroquois nations.

Seneca lived in longhouses in permanent villages. The largest village was Ganondagan with 150 longhouses. There were threats of war from neighboring Natives. These Natives included the Huron (Wyandot) the Susquehannock (Conestoga) and the Lenape people (Delaware, Minnisink and Esopus). The Seneca were strong warriors and captured other towns. Their territory was in Eastern New York. It was between Seneca Lake and Genesee River. It was also in New York from Niagara Country to the Allegheny river. Seneca was divided into a western and eastern branch.

Seneca did hunting and gathering. They also farmed the Three Sisters (corn, beans, and squash). Women grew these plants and collected plants, roots, berries, nuts, and fruit. The Seneca society was matrilineal. This meant inheritance and family were through the mother's side. However, women were not much in politics and diplomacy. Seneca men developed towns. Men also went hunting in the fall and fishing in the spring.

Seneca joined the Fur trade. In the 17th century, the Iroquois confederacy conquered neighboring territories. The Iroquois replace people who died from disease with captives. The Iroquois defeated the Huron (Wyandot). The Senecas also defeated the Neutral confederacy in 1650 in the west. They defeated the Andaste (Susquehannock) in the south. The Seneca had strong diplomacy in the region. The Seneca led a powerful confederacy with the Cayuga, Onondagas, Oneidas, Mohawks and later the Tuscaroras. The Seneca were the "Keepers of the West Door" or "Door-Keepers". The Seneca sent eight sachems to the Great Council of the Iroquois.

Seneca had different interactions with Europeans. The French Marquis de Denonville led an attack against the Seneca people in 1687. He destroyed many towns, including Ganondagan. The Iroquois were allies with the British in the Covenant Chain. The Seneca eventually were allies with the Dutch and the British during the Seven Year's War. There was much conflict between Seneca and American colonists. Seneca did not support the Treaty of Fort Stanwix. They did not like that Americans were moving West into their land. Many colonists also had negative views about the Iroquois. The British tried to get the Iroquois on their side.

The Seneca eventually supported the British during the American Revolution. Some Iroquois wanted to support Americans and others not. This conflict led to the division of the Iroquois Confederacy. Seneca fought with British in the Cherry Valley massacre and the Battle of Minisink. The Seneca and Iroquois had victories against the colonists from 1777 to 1778. In response, General John Sullivan (general) led a planned attack against the Iroquois. Sullivan and his troops destroyed villages and weakened the Iroquois. The Iroquois Confederacy fell apart.

After the American Revolution, Seneca lost much land. They gave up lands in the Treaty of Canandaigua (1794) and Treaty of Big Tree (1797). In the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838), the Seneca had to move to Missouri. Many Seneca people moved to Canada after the war. The Seneca Nation of Indians in New York formed a modern republican government in 1848.

Many Senecas lost land so the Kinzau Dam could be built in the 1960s.

Most members of the Seneca live in New York. There are about 8,000 members of the Seneca Nation of Indians . They live on six reservations. They include Allegany, the Cattaraugus near Gowanda, New York; the Buffalo Creek Territory, the Niagara Falls Territory in Niagara Falls, New York, and the Oil Springs Reservation. Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians has about 1,200 citizens. They live Tonawanda Reservation near Akron, New York. The Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma live near Miami, Oklahoma.

The Seneca have diverse businesses. These include retail sales, arts and crafts, smokeshops, sports clothing, gasoline and cigarette sales and casinos.

Plants vs. Zombies 2

Plants vs. Zombies 2: It's About Time is a tower defense game developed by PopCap Games and published by Electronic Arts. The game is a sequel to the original "Plants vs. Zombies" and was released for iOS on July 9, 2013. The game was later ported to other platforms including Android, Windows Phone, Windows 8.1, and BlackBerry 10.

In "Plants vs. Zombies 2", the player takes on the role of Crazy Dave, who uses a time machine to travel back in time and prevent the zombies from eating his brain. The game is divided into several different eras, each taking place in a different time period, such as Ancient Egypt, the Wild West, and the Future.

The gameplay in "Plants vs. Zombies 2" is similar to that of the original game, with players using a variety of different plants to defend against waves of zombies. However, the game introduces new features such as plant food, which can be used to give plants temporary boosts, and power-ups, which can be used to defeat large groups of zombies.

The game also features new zombie types, each with their own unique abilities and weaknesses. For example, the Pirate Zombie can steal plants and carry them to the back of the lawn, while the Chicken Wrangler Zombie can release a swarm of zombie chickens.

"Plants vs. Zombies 2" was generally well-received, with critics praising the game's graphics, gameplay, and overall presentation. However, the game was criticized for its use of microtransactions and the difficulty of some of the later levels.

Despite these criticisms, "Plants vs. Zombies 2" has maintained a large player base and has been updated regularly with new content and features.

Following the success of "Plants vs. Zombies 2", several sequels and spin-offs have been released, including "Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare", "Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2", and "Plants vs. Zombies Heroes".

Schweigt stille, plaudert nicht, BWV 211

Schweigt stille, plaudert nicht", BWV 211, also known as the Coffee Cantata", is a cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. Unlike most of his other cantatas, it is not a religious cantata. It is a cantata about coffee.

Bach was the leader of the collegium musicum in Leipzig. He performed concerts in Café Zimmermann, a coffeehouse in Leipzig. The text of the cantata was published by Picander in 1732. Bach may have written the music around 1734.

In Bach's time, coffee was expensive. People also thought that drinking coffee was not a good thing.

The cantata begins with the narrator telling the audience to be quiet. Schlendrian enters with his daughter, Liesgen. He is angry because Liesgen likes to drink coffee. Schlendrian threatens to take away everything from Liesgen if she does not stop drinking coffee. Liesgen does not care. Finally, Schlendrian threatens that Liesgen will never get a husband if she does not stop drinking coffee. Liesgen promises to stop drinking coffee. Schlendrian leaves to find Liesgen a husband. Liesgen secretly says that her new husband must allow her to make her coffee whenever she wants. The narrator, Liesgen, and Schlendrian sing a closing chorus together.

The cantata is written for soprano (as Liesgen), tenor (as the narrator), and bass (as Schlendrian) soloists, a flute, two violins, and basso continuo. It has ten movements. Bach never wrote an opera in his life. Even so, the cantata can be thought of as a mini-opera.

The Neutral Confederacy (also Neutral Nation, Neutral people, or Attawandaron by neighbouring tribes) were a Native American people. They spoke the Neutral Huron Language. This language is part of the Iroquois language family. They lived in present-day southwestern and south-central Ontario in Canada, North America. The Neutral people were related to other Iroquois Natives. Neighbors were the Huron people, the Petun, the Wenro to the east, Erie people, the Susquehannock and the Iroquois Confederacy. The Iroquois Confederacy was east of the Neutral people. The Iroquois eventually destroyed the Neutral Confederacy.

The Neutrals called themselves Chonnonton, or 'people of the deer'. The French called these people neutral, because they were not in many wars. For instance, the Neutral people did not fight in the wars between the Iroquois and the Huron in the 17th century.

Jesuits had contact with the Neutrals and made records of the people. The Neutral allied with the Wenrohronon to defend against the Iroquois Confederacy. However, the Iroquois attacked the Neutral people around 1650. The Iroquois had also destroyed the Huron, Petun and Erie Nations. The Neutral Confederacy fell apart after the 1650s. They fled or joined other Iroquois nations. Many Natives also died from diseases.

The Neutral people lived in longhouses. They did hunting, fishing and farming. Main crops were the Three Sisters (corn, squash and beans). Meats included deer, raccoon, wolves, wild cats, squirrels, beavers and turkeys. Apples and chestnuts were also part of the diet. Feast of the Dead was an important ceremony. In this feast, they placed the bones of the dead in a common grave.

Tsouharissen or Souharissen ("Child of the Sun") was chief of several villages of the Neutral people.

The Neutrals used stones to make spearheads and arrowheads. They traded maize, tobacco, and black squirrel and furs for steel axes, glass beads, cloaks, conch shells, gourd containers, and firearms.

There has been much archaeological research since the 19th century. Several sites of the Neutral people have been explored. These include various sites in Ontario. An example is the Southwold Earthworks.


Phyllodytes

Phyllodytes is a genus of frogs. They are called heart-tongued frogs in English. These frogs live in eastern Brazil.

In 2009, scientists DNA from all the frogs in this group. They decided to split "Phyllodytes" into "Phyllodytes" and another group, "Phytotriades". This article shows the frog species that are still in "Phyllodytes". Some scientists think that some of these frogs should be in other groups instead.

 These are small frogs. They live in trees. These frogs lay eggs in water in the leaves of bromeliad plants. These plants are epiphytes: they grow on trees instead of putting their roots in the ground. For example, a bromeliad might grow on a branch high in the forest canopy. Water falls into the bromeliad leaves and forms a little pool near the plant's axil. Many female frogs lay their eggs on the leaves so that the tadpoles fall into the water when they hatch. The tadpoles swim and grow inside the bromeliad plant without ever going to a river, stream, pond, or the ground.
The frogs have large fangs called odontoids. Male "Phyllodytes" do vocalize, in contrast to "Phytotriades".

This genus has 14 species in it:

AmphibiaWeb says "Phytotriades auratus" is in this genus, but other scientific works do not.

Derbyshire Dome

The Derbyshire Dome is one of the keys to understanding the middle part of England. It is a geological formation across mid-Derbyshire in England.

The White Peak area of the Peak District is named after the limestone plateau landscape of the 'Derbyshire Dome' anticline. It was laid down in a tropical sea about 350 million years ago in the Carboniferous period. Later the limestone raised above water in a dome shape. It was eroded so that many caverns existed. This is described as a karst landscape.

The plateau is mostly between 200m and 300m above sea level. This limestone outcrop is surrounded on the west, north and east by a horseshoe-shaped formation of younger sandstones (gritstones) and shales, known as the Dark Peak (see diagram). The town of Buxton is at the western edge of the limestone region. The Triassic sandstones of the Midlands plain are the south edge of the limestone region. 

The ground is hard to move across. Evidently much of it was made of coral reefs, which are very tough and irregular. The roads of the Peak District are narrow and winding. Motorways avoid the Peak District by being to the East and West of the dome.

The other main karst landscapes of England are the Yorkshire Dales and the Mendip Hills.

Phyllodytes wuchereri

The yellow heart-tongued frog ("Phyllodytes wuchereri") is a frog. It lives in the Brazil. It lives in the state of Bahia, in the Atlantic forest. People have seen this frog 400 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is 25.1-26.0 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 26.2-27.1 mm. The skin of the back and backs of the legs is brown. There is a white stripe from each eye down to the end of the body. There are vomerine teeth in the frog's jaw. The adult male frog has an adult nuptial pad on each front foot.

Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. It lives in rainforest that has never been cut down, forest that was cut down and grew back, and places where humans cut down some of the trees to make places that are shady but not too shady so they can plant cacao farms. Scientists say that as long as human beings like to plant and grow cacao, the frog will have a place to live.

The male frogs can fight each other over good places to live and find female frogs. The frogs live on bromeliad plants. The female frog lays eggs in the bromeliads and the tadpoles swim and grow in the pools water that collects near the middle of the plant. There is only one tadpole in each pool of water but sometimes more than one pool in the same plant.

Scientists think this frog might be in danger if human beings take away their bromeliad plants, but they don't think anyone is doing this as of 2023.

Scientists are not sure exactly how much danger this frog is in of dying out. This frog lives in a large area, but it is divided up into smaller areas and because the places the frog lives are still being changed by humans.

Personal watercraft

A personal watercraft (PWC), often referred to as a water scooter or jet ski, is a popular and exhilarating recreational watercraft that provides riders with a thrilling on-water experience. PWCs are designed for one, two, or sometimes three riders and offer a unique way to explore bodies of water.

The heart of a PWC's propulsion system is its inboard engine, which powers a specialized water jet propulsion system. This system operates through a pump-jet mechanism featuring a screw-shaped impeller. The impeller, typically located at the rear of the watercraft, draws water in and forcefully expels it, propelling the PWC forward at high speeds. This design allows for agile and responsive maneuverability on the water.

PWCs are known for their versatility and are often used for various forms of water-based entertainment and recreation. Riders can choose to sit or stand on the PWC, adapting their position to their preference or the specific model of watercraft.

These watercraft are designed for fun and adventure, and they can reach impressive speeds, often exceeding 100 miles (161 kilometers) per hour. This capability makes them ideal for activities such as racing, water sports, exploring coastal areas, and enjoying leisurely rides on lakes and rivers. With their compact and lightweight design, PWCs are easy to transport and launch, allowing riders to access a wide range of aquatic environment.

Bowfin

The bowfin ("Amia calva") is a primitive bony fish in the genus "Amia" that lives in North America. It is a relict species, last of a group known as the Halecomorphi. That group appeared the Lower Triassic, about 250 million years ago. 

The bowfin is described as "primitive" because they have characteristics of their early ancestors. The closest living relatives of bowfins are gars: the two groups make up the clade Holostei.

Their physiology is quite interesting. Like gars, bowfin are "bimodal breathers": they can to breathe both water and air. Their gills exchange gases in the water, and they also have a gas bladder. The gas bladder is the secret: it keeps buoyancy, and lets the fish breathe air by a small pneumatic duct which goes from the foregut to the gas bladder. They break the surface to gulp air. This lets them survive conditions of hypoxia which would be lethal to most species.

The first fish lacked jaws and used negative pressure to suck their food in through their mouths. The jaw in the bowfin is a result of their evolutionary need to be able to catch and eat bigger and more nutritious prey. As a result of being able to gather more nutrients, Bowfin are able to live a more active lifestyle. The jaw of a bowfin has several adaptations.

Some people mistake northern snakeheads ("Channa argus") for bowfin because even if they are in a different genus, they have similarities to them in appearance, most noticeably their elongated, cylindrical shape, and long dorsal fin that runs along their backs.

A common parasite of bowfin is the anchor worm from the genus "Lernaea". These crustaceans infest the skin and bases of fins, with consequences ranging from slowed growth to death.

Bowfin are stalking, ambush predators that move into the shallows at night to prey on fish, and aquatic invertebrates such as crawfish, mollusks, and aquatic insects.

Halecomorphi

Halecomorphi is a type of ray-finned fish in the Neopterygii. 

The only living Halecomorph species are the bowfin ("Amia calva") and eyespot bowfin ("Amia ocellicauda").

Foundational crisis of mathematics

The foundational crisis of mathematics describes the debate that existed in mathematics starting at the end of the 19th century until the middle of the 20th century.

In 1874, at the University of Halle in Germany, the mathematician Georg Cantor presented his set theory. Years later, the mathematician Bertrand Russell found paradoxical cases in which there were sets composed of other sets, or sets in which the set itself was an element of itself. This was called Russell's paradox.

As a result, three schools of mathematical thought appeared: intuitionism, logicism, and formalism.

Nicolas Bourbaki appeared right after World War II, since foundational crisis of mathematics was evident, and the loss of mathematicians during war was big. Bourbaki proposed the new foundations of mathematics.

New Math appeared after Nicolas Bourbaki. During this time, math education had a big change.

Some mathematicians believe that still we are in a foundational crisis of mathematics. Some others, believe we are in a New New Math, sometimes called Math wars.

On Sunday, January 18, 2015, he was found dead with a shot to the head, in his apartment in the Tower Boulevard building of the Torres Le Parc complex, in the Puerto Madero neighborhood where he lived.

Alberto Nisman was raised in a Jewish family. His parents were Sara Garfunkel, and Isaac Adolfo Nisman (born 1936), an upper-middle-class textile entrepreneur.

He studied at the University of Buenos Aires, took half of the free subjects and graduated as a lawyer with an average of 8. He began to work "meritorious" (free work without a dependency relationship) in the Judicial Department of Morón. Once received, he began his judicial career in that jurisdiction.

He was married to federal judge Sandra Arroyo Salgado ―who at the time of Nisman's death was in charge of the San Isidro federal court―, with whom he had two daughters.

When he divorced he left his wife the house for his children and rented an apartment in Le Parc.

At 10:30 p.m. on Sunday, January 18, 2015, Nisman's mother was alerted that her son did not respond to calls and went to the apartment where the prosecutor lived, in the Torre Boulevard building of the Le Parc Tower complex, in the neighborhood of Puerto Madero (Buenos Aires), which was locked from the inside. After trying to get in, a locksmith was able to open the service door. Nisman's body was found in the bathroom, shot in the head, along with a .22-caliber Bersa gun and a shell casing.

The next day, Monday, he was scheduled to present his complaint to the Criminal Legislation Commission of the Chamber of Deputies of the Argentina.

A few days after the prosecutor's death, the locksmith who was called to open the door stated that it was not locked, but rather: "The service door was locked (from the inside) and had only the latch ... the latch opens with a little wire, I asked the mother for the key, I made the move, she turned the handle and opened it." The day after the locksmith's statements, Nisman's mother clarified that the service door was closed, and that she had previously opened it herself.

His remains were buried in the Israelite Cemetery of La Tablada, twenty meters from the tombs of the victims of the AMIA Bombing, in the so-called sector of the "Martires".

Alhandra heart-tongued frog

The Alhandra heart-tongued frog ("Phyllodytes brevirostris") is a frog. It lives in Brazil. People have seen it as high as 100 meters above sea level.

This frog lives in forests and shrublands. This frog sits on bromeliad plants. Scientists think the female frog lays her eggs in water on the leaves of the plants. They think that the tadpoles swim in this water. The scientists are not sure because they have not seen the frog do so yet.

1992 attack on Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires

The Attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires was a suicide bombing attack happened on Tuesday, March 17, 1992, causing 22 deaths and 242 injuries. The attack completely destroyed the headquarters of the embassy and the consulate, located at numbers 910 and 916 Arroyo Street in the city of Buenos Aires. The attack was investigated by the Supreme Court of Justice, without identifying any suspect and without the case being brought to trial until 2022.
On 17 March 1992, at 2:42 pm (UTC−3), a pick-up truck driven by a suicide bomber and loaded with explosives smashed into the front of the Israeli Embassy at the corner of Arroyo and Suipacha, and detonated. The embassy, a Catholic church, and a nearby school building were destroyed. Four Israelis died, but most of the victims were Argentine civilians, many of them were children. The blast killed 29 and wounded 242. It was Argentina's deadliest terror attack until the 1994 AMIA bombing. It remains the deadliest attack on an Israeli diplomatic mission.

The attackers are believed to have entered the country through the so-called triple border region, the area where the borders of Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil meet.

Two years later, on July 18, 1994, a car bomb exploded in front of AMIA, the most important Jewish mutual organization in the country, also in Buenos Aires, resulting in the death of 85 people.

In 2004, Carlos Menem, who was the president of Argentina between 1989 and 1999, declared in an interview that the fact of having been the only Argentine president to visit Israel could have been what offended these terrorist organizations. And then he added: "The other thing that could be is the sending of Argentine ships to the Gulf on the occasion of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait."

The sending of two warships to the Gulf, in 1991, to reinforce the coalition led by the United States against Iraq, was a major event in Argentine foreign policies during the Menem presidency.

Initially, expertise was carried out by the Federal Police and Gendarmerie. Both agreed that it had been a car bomb, but disagreed on the explosive used: trotyl and pentrite, for the police; hexogen with some kind of initiator, for the Gendarmerie.

In 1996, the Supreme Court changed the hypothesis and reported that based on the results of the expertise carried out by the National Academy of Engineering, it could be established "with a certain degree of certainty" that the attack was the result of an explosion that occurred inside the building.

In 1999, by the agreement issued on December 23, the Court changed its hypothesis again and held that the attack had been carried out with a car bomb, specifying that it could have been a Ford F-100 truck.

Alles mit Gott und nichts ohn' ihn, BWV 1127

"Alles mit Gott und nichts ohn' ihn", BWV 1127 is an aria written by Johann Sebastian Bach. It was written in October 1713 for Duke Wilhelm Ernst of Saxe-Weimar's birthday. The text was written by Johann Anton Mylius. It was discovered in 2005 in the Anna Amalia Library in Weimar.

Duke Wilhelm Ernst of Saxe-Weimar was born on 19 October 1662 (O.S.). He became co-ruler of Saxe-Weimar with his brother, Johan Ernst III in 1683. When Saxe-Weimar changed to using the Gregorian calendar, he chose 30 October to be his new birthday.

In July 1708, Bach became the court organist at Weimar. Johann Samuel Drese and his son Johann Wilhelm were the court composers at the time. As an organist, Bach did not have to write music.

Johann Anton Mylius was the superintendent of Buttstädt. He wrote an ode for Duke Wilhelm's birthday. It is based on the duke's motto. He asked Bach to write a melody for the ode.

The aria is written for a soprano soloist, two violins, a viola, and basso continuo.

Manhattan distance

The Manhattan distance is a different way of measuring distance. It is named after the grid shape of streets in Manhattan. If there are two points, formula_1 and formula_2, the Manhattan distance between the two points is formula_3.

This distance can be imagined as the length needed to move between two points in a grid where you can only move up, down, left or right.

This definition can be used for three and higher dimensions too.
If there are two vectors, formula_4 and formula_5, then the manhattan distance between the two points is the absolute value of the difference between all numbers in the vector. Or, in notation:
formula_6

Sacro Catino

The Sacro Catino is an artifact preserved in Genoa in the Museum of the Treasure of the Cathedral of San Lorenzo ; tradition has it the authentic Holy Grail, or the simulacrum of the dish used by Jesus Christ during the Last Supper, brought to Genoa after the First Crusade by Guglielmo Embriaco .

The basin is a hexagonal vase made of bright green transparent material. When it was brought to Genoa it was believed that it was emerald . The Sacro Catino ended up shattered during its stay in France and was the subject of various restorations : the first in 1908, in 1951, and finally in 2017.

The study of the object made during the period of presence in France by the Académie des sciences of the Institut de France established that it was a Byzantine crystal and not an emerald. The following studies would have postdated the work considering it to be an Islamic artifact of the 9th - 10th century .

The source of this belief is Jacopo da Varagine, who tells in the Genoese Chronicle that, during the first Crusade ( XI century ), the Genoese soldiers under the command of Guglielmo Embriaco participated in the capture of the city of Cesarea ( 1101 ), coming into possession of what was believed to be the dish of Jesus' Last Supper.

When Genoa was conquered Napoleon Bonaparte, the dish was brought to Paris in 1806 and, when it was returned on June 14, 1816, it returned to Genoa broken into 10 pieces, one of which was missing.

In 2017, the "emerald vase" was returned to the city in its transparent color, after the restoration carried out by the Opificio delle Pietre Dure in Florence. According to L. Ciatti, protagonist of the restoration attributed to Daniele Angellotto said it was not obtained from a huge natural emerald, but that it was a simple green glass vase, with no economic value.

Bahia heart-tongued frog

The Bahia heart-tongued frog ("Phyllodytes melanomystax") is a frog. It lives in Brazil. People have seen it as high as 800 meters above sea level.

This frog lives on bromeliad plants that grow on tree branches. Scientists have not seen it in bromeliad plants that grow on the ground or on small plants. In some parts of Brazil, it also lives in shrubby places. The female frog lays eggs on the leaves. When they hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water in the middle of the bromeliad plants and then swims and grows in the water.

This frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. Although human beings cut down much of the forest where it used to live to make farms and places for animals to eat grass, there is a large forest space left as of 2023.

Harmonic mean

Harmonic means are a type of mean. It is the number of values divided by the reciprocal of the values. If there are formula_1 numbers formula_2, then the harmonic mean of these numbers are
formula_3

Out of the geometric mean and arithmetic mean, the harmonic mean is usually the smallest.

Let's find the harmonic mean of 2,4 and 5. There are three numbers so we will be dividing three. The reciprocals of the numbers are formula_4, formula_5 and formula_6. If we add the reciprocals we get formula_7. If we divide three by this number, the result is formula_8 (approximately 3.157894737)

Inna Afinogenova

Inna Afinogenova (Born, January 14, 1989) is a Russian journalist, who until May 2022 worked as deputy director of the RT website in Spanish and for the YouTube channel, called "Ahí les va".

Afinogenova was born on January 14, 1989, in the Republic of Dagestan in southern Russia. She is a journalism graduate from M.V. Lomonosov of Moscow 

Journalism and the Spanish language are her main interests. She learned Spanish from a very young age and received classes from an Argentine teacher from the ages of 12 to 18. In an interview with the Argentine host Beto Casella she said about her Argentine teacher «She instilled in me the love for that country. And then I had the opportunity to go to Argentina in 2008. I went several times, and I spent a long time in Buenos Aires."

She worked in several media outlets (from radio in Argentina to television) and worked for the Russian television channel RT en Español, holding various positions on said channel until she became the deputy director of the website.

She has worked in Spanish audiovisual content in Spanish called "Ahí les va", on the YouTube video platform.
On March 1, 2022, Google blocked access to the YouTube channels of Russian news agencies Russia Today and Sputnik throughout the European Union, including Afinogenova's news space There You Go, in compliance with sanctions imposed by the European Union to Russia for the invasion of Ukraine.

Previously, Afinogenova had made some controversy since on December 1, 2021, in her program There it goes, she commented: «January will come, then February and March, it will end 2022 and surely in the (Western) media they will continue to read that the invasion is imminent." This and other previous controversies were what triggered this information channel to be deleted from the network and elsewhere, since the EU and the US "consider that their message in favor of the Russian theses is unacceptable in times of war".

On May 3, 2022, she posted a video on YouTube explaining that he had left Russia and the Spanish RT channel because he does not agree with this war and any other war.

She also blamed the war, considering it a serious strategic error, because it has greatly strengthened NATO: "No one who is against NATO supports this war, because nothing has strengthened that organization as much as the decision made by the government Russian, an organization that was in full decline, seemed totally anachronistic".

Electrical tape

Electrical tape (or insulating tape) is a type of pressure-sensitive adhesive tape used primarily to insulate electrical wire and cable splices. This type of tape is capable of withstanding conditions of extreme temperatures, corrosion, humidity and high voltages. The tape is made of thin PVC material, usually 14mm wide; one side of the tape is impregnated with an adhesive. PVC has been chosen because it is a low-cost, flexible material and has excellent electrical insulating properties, although it has the disadvantage of hardening with time and heat.

In the 1950s, vinyl emerged as a highly versatile material for a wide range of uses, from shower curtains to cable insulation. However, getting it to have the right characteristics to make a tape required a significant research effort.

An important ingredient in vinyl film was tricresyl phosphate (TCP), which was used as a plasticizer. Unfortunately, the TCP had a tendency to migrate, which gave the surface of the tape an oily quality, affecting the adhesive property of the tape. Therefore, the 3M research team began work on creating a reliable vinyl tape that had the right characteristics in terms of electrical insulation, physical resistance and chemical properties.

Experiments were carried out combining new plasticizers with the vinyl resin, which was white and floury in consistency. Finally in January 1946, the 3M team of inventors Snell, Oace, and Eastwood applied for a patent for a vinyl electrical insulating tape with a plasticizer and a non-sulfur-based rubbery adhesive. The first commercialized version of the tape was sold for wrapping wires.

Carlo Perogalli

Carlo Perogalli (Milan, June 25, 1921 - Milan, 2005) was an Italian architect, architectural historian and academic.

Carlo Perogalli earned his degree in Architecture from Milan Polytechnic in 1946, subsequently serving as Ambrogio Annoni’s assistant in 1947. Transitioning under the mentorship of Gio Ponti, he later established his own studio in Milan alongside designer Attilio Mariani in 1950, engaging in collaborative research until 1958. Gio Ponti, Carlo Perogalli’s associate, was part of the Concrete Art Movement (MAC).

Embodying their conceptual exploration within the “MAC Movimento Arte Concreta”, Perogalli and Mariani notably conceived the structures at Viale Beatrice d’Este 24 (1951-52) and Viale Beatrice d’Este 26 (1955-56) in Milan’s Quadronno District, showcasing their artistic evolution.

Post-completion, Perogalli shifted focus to university teaching, delving into the intricate relationships between architecture and the arts, particularly in the design of Viale Beatrice d’Este. His academic journey included acquiring the university chairs of “Stylistic and Constructive Characters of Monuments” in 1954, “Restoration of Monuments” in 1958, and “History of Architecture” from 1960 to 1991 at the Politecnico di Milano.

Authoring over forty volumes on architecture and restoration, alongside numerous conceptual reflections intertwining design and art, Perogalli’s contributions remain integral to the discourse. 
Luciano Caramel’s studies on MAC suggest a two-phase periodization: the initial phase (1948-1952) dominated by painting, succeeded by a second phase (1952-1958) marked by the active participation of architects, engineers, and designers.

Continuing his analysis, the architect discerns a transformative shift from art as a self-contained entity to the object, drawing inspiration from artistic currents spanning Cubism to Concrete Art. This dialogue sparks a tangible interchange of forms between the artistic realm and the products of industry, particularly machines and objects.

In this symbiotic relationship, architecture emerges as a convergence of diverse arts, risking the adoption of painting and sculpture forms. This shared language fosters a communal space, a concrete space, where the boundaries between artistic disciplines blur. Some architects, it appeared, viewed architectural decoration not as a transgression but as an exploration, a divergence from the conventional perception of it as a “crime.” Your rephrasing effectively captures Perogalli’s advocacy for renewal, contesting the supremacy of rationalism-functionalism. His vision sought to introduce a more dialectical design approach, moving beyond the prevailing monopoly and cultivating a novel outlook on the interplay between form and function.

Central Pollution Control Board

Pollution control board is a government organization responsible for the pollution control. It also has a big responsibility to ensure that not only India but also any other country is free from pollution. The Pollution Control Board, popularly known as the PCB, The Board’s mandate is to protect human health and environment from environmental pollution.

The Pollution Control Board (PCB), Ministry of Environment & Forests (MoEF) is responsible for implementing National Pollution Control Programme (NPCP) under Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution), Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) and Noise pollution control Acts 1974, 1986 and Rules 1994 respectively. It also implements other Acts like Environment Protection Act 1986, Solid Waste Management Rules 2000 etc which have been enacted to ensure sustainable development through ecologically sound management of natural resources.

The Pollution Control Board (PCB) is a government body responsible for maintaining environmental standards in India. It was established under the Environment Protection Act, 1986 and its primary role is to ensure that the environment remains safe for human welfare. The PCB has many responsibilities like protecting the natural resources and promoting clean energy sources like solar energy which are considered green technologies.

The PCB requires No Objection Certificates (NOCs) from all industries before they can carry out any project that may harm the environment or pollute air or water. These NOCs are issued by an panel called as Expert Committee.

The Consent to Establish is a clearance that is required before any industry, plant or process can be established.  The consent to establish is the first step in the process and it requires a business to obtain all necessary consents from the relevant authorities. The CTE allows for the establishment of a business and details such as ownership, location and management. It also outlines how the company will be governed and run by its directors. The consent to establish is issued once the agency has reviewed all environmental impact studies and conducted site-specific investigations. The agency also verify if there are no effects on soil, water, air and noise pollution.

The CTO is an important document that provides a detailed outline of how the company will operate. Once the Industry, Plant, or Process being established according to mandatory pollution control systems, the units are required to obtain consent to operate. This is a legal document that confirms that you have all the necessary permits for your plant and operations.

The validity and renewal of consent is one of the most fundamental aspects of consent. The concept of validity, as it applies to consent, is an important one to understand. Consent Valid Unless The Person Has A Valid Reason For Refusing To Consent. Mainly the pollution control board issue it for 3 to 5 years. Consent to operate remains valid for a period of 5, 10, and 15 years according to the red, orange, and green category.

Hazardous waste

Hazardous waste is any waste that contains chemicals, toxic or corrosive materials. Hazardous waste can be found in many industries, including mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. It can also be produced by households through activities such as cleaning up after a spill or accident. These materials can pollute the environment and pose threat to human lives. The main reason for this is that these hazardous wastes are not properly disposed of. They can cause serious environmental damage such as groundwater pollution, air pollution and soil contamination.

Hazardous waste is any waste that contains chemicals, toxic or corrosive materials. Hazardous waste can be found in many industries, including mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. It can also be produced by households through activities such as cleaning up after a spill or accident.

Hazardous waste is any waste that has been determined to be hazardous under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976. Hazardous wastes are divided into two general categories: ignitable waste and corrosive waste.


Hazardous waste is called "hazardous" because of the potential harm it could cause to people or the environment. For example, if you spilled a paint thinner on your carpet, it could cause burns to anyone who breathes in the fumes.

When hazardous wastes are improperly handled, they can release harmful chemicals into the air or water supply that cause health problems for nearby residents and wildlife. These wastes also pose risk to workers who handle them improperly or who work with them on a regular basis. If proper precautions are not taken when handling hazardous waste, accidents can occur which may result in death or serious injury to workers and others who come into contact with them.

The rule 6 of the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management & Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016 and amendment thereto shall be required to make an application in Form 1 to the State Pollution Control Board and obtain an authorisation from the State Pollution Control Board of Every occupier of the facility who is engaged in handling, generation, collection, storage, packaging, transportation, use, treatment, processing, recycling, recovery, pre-processing, co-processing, utilisation, offering for sale, transfer or disposal of the hazardous and other wastes. Such application for authorisation shall be accompanied with a copy each of the following documents, namely:-


The procedure for obtaining authorization under Hazardous Waste Management is as follows:

Phyllodytes edelmoi

The Phyllodytes edelmoi is a frog. It lives in Brazil in the state of Alagoas. People have seen it as high as 650 meters above sea level.

This frog lives in forests and rocky places. It lives on cliffs and mountains. Scientists have seen it in plants that grow on the ground and plants that grow on trees.

The female frog lays eggs in the small pools of water that sit in the leaves of the plants. The tadpoles hatch and swim in these pools. Scientists think it might also live in bromeliad plants in people's gardens but they haven't seen them there yet.

This frog is not in danger of dying out. Scientists say this is because it is good at living in places that humans have changed.

Minetest

Minetest is a free and open-source game, created by Perttu Ahola. It is just like Minecraft but it can be freely played. The original author of "Minetest" simply described it as a ""Minecraft" clone".

In the default game of "Minetest", Minetest Game (MTG for short), players explore a 3D world made from cubic blocks. Players may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures and landscapes. Players can change the game settings to fight computer-controlled "mobs", as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. The game can be played with mods, which edits the gameplay.

As the game developed over the years, "Minetest" has been praised and is a popular game. Since November 2013, "Minetest" has been downloaded over 1.4 million times from GitHub, and the Android version of "Minetest" has over 500 thousand downloads on the Google Play store.

"Minetest" is set in a world full of blocks shaped like cubes. Gameplay is in the first-person camera for normal, but players also have the option for third-person camera. The game world is composed of in-game 3D objects, many of them are just simple cubes, commonly called nodes. Different in-game nodes (blocks) represent different materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects, one node at a time. Nodes are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move smoothly around the world. Players can mine blocks and then place them somewhere else, granting the permission to them to change (modify) the game world. Players can also craft a wide variety of hand-held tools to help them with the world change. Pickaxes allow players to dig rocky nodes, shovels speed up the digging of dirt and sand, water buckets allow to pick up water nodes, etc. A player controls a 3D character known as Sam, which is first-letter acronym for "Sam ain't Minecraft".
As players explore the world, new areas are officially generated by using a map seed randomly or choosed by the player. A new game puts the player in the center of a voxel cube 62 thousand blocks across, so the player can travel 31 thousand blocks in any direction like sideways, up, or down before reaching the invisible wall (the barrier) at the end of the world.

The world is divided into biomes ranging from deserts to jungles to snowfields; the terrain includes plains, mountains, forests, caves, and various lava and water bodies. The in-game time system follows a day and night cycle, and one full cycle lasts 20 real-time minutes just like Minecraft.

Minetest provides only two basic game mode options: Enable Damage and Creative Mode which affect how players interact with the world and use items. Creative Mode is meant to provide players with infinite resources, while toggling the damage setting decides whether the players can take damage from environmental hazards and other players.

Minetest has a built-in client-server architecture, and can be played solo or multiplayer. A player starting a new game can choose between playing in a single-player mode, or hosting a server to which other Minetest players can connect.

The full source code of Minetest, and all of its artistic assets such as textures and sounds, are distributed under a variety of free licenses, making it easier to create changed versions and derivatives. The base version of Minetest provides an interface for games and mods written in Lua. Games define the basic rules of the game world, and are a core feature of Minetest. Most games feature sandbox gameplay focused on construction, mining, and creativity. Mods are used to further customize different parts of gameplay, and are an permanent part of Minetest. Mods are server-side and work out of the box when playing on Internet servers, with no manual installation needed.

Banco Credicoop

Banco Credicoop ("Creditco-op Bank") is an Argentine cooperative bank. After the 2001 crisis in Argentina, it became the second private bank in the country behind Banco Macro Bansud and the first with completely national public capital. It is the most important cooperative bank in Latin America.

Banco Credicoop has its origin in the Credit Unions. In 1976 the Argentinean military government tried to eliminate credit unions, an area of ​​the cooperative sector. This prompted a defensive action that led to the merger of credit cooperatives in order to survive, giving rise to Banco Credicoop in 1979, from the merger of the 44 credit unions that existed in the Capital and in Greater Buenos Aires. Aires, some of which had been created in the early 20th century.
Towards the mid-1940s, with the election of Juan Domingo Perón, the Credit Unions began to reflect the industrial development that took place in the country, originating an accelerated growth and diversification of the sectors served.

Starting in 1958, the creation of the Cooperative Funds Mobilization Institute (IMFC) as a second-tier cooperative caused a real explosion in the number and geographical dispersion of the entities. From that moment, the cooperative credit unions developed a new type of operation based on capturing resources through sight accounts, compensated by a national clearinghouse of payment orders. 

This allowed them to dispose of between 9% and 11% of the total deposits in the financial system, which the savings banks channeled to finance small and medium-sized companies, cooperatives and individuals. The development of cooperativism in a sector as sensitive as the financial one provoked the early opposition of national and foreign banks, as well as sectors of the big bourgeoisie, which generated a series of regulations and restrictive actions on the part of the Argentine State that reached their culminating point from the coup d'état of 1966.

The civic-military dictatorship that governed Argentina between June 1966 and March 1973 –which intended to reorganize Argentine society– attacked credit cooperatives in their double character: as a financial company oriented to the development of small and medium-sized national companies, wage earners and entities of the social economy, a sector that had no place in the economic plans of the self-proclaimed “Argentine Revolution”; and as a social movement that had to freeze its activity –along with all the other social and political institutions of the country– during the stage of “economic time” imposed by the dictatorship. In short, of the 974 credit unions that operated in 1966, only 417 were able to survive the dictatorship. Their share of total deposits in the financial system had fallen from more than 10% to just under 2%.

Père Goriot

Le Père Goriot (, ""Old Goriot"" or "Father Goriot") is an 1835 novel by French novelist and playwright Honoré de Balzac (1799–1850). It is in the "Scènes de la vie privée" section of his novel sequence "La Comédie humaine". It is set in Paris in 1819. It follows the lives of three characters: the elderly Goriot, a mysterious criminal named Vautrin and a naive law student named Eugène de Rastignac.

The novel takes place during the Bourbon Restoration. It brought major changes to French society. The struggle by individuals to reach a higher social status is a major theme in the book. Balzac analyzes through Goriot and others the nature of family and marriage that provides a pessimistic view of them.

In the first book edition, the novel had seven chapters:


The character Eugène de Rastignac had appeared as an old man in Balzac's earlier philosophical fantasy novel "La Peau de chagrin". While writing the first version of "Le Père Goriot", Balzac named the character "Massiac", but he decided to use the same character from "La Peau de chagrin". Other characters were changed in a similar way. 

"Le Père Goriot" is widely considered Balzac's essential novel. Its influence on French literature has been considerable, as shown by novelist Félicien Marceau's remark: "We are all children of "Le Père Goriot"." 

In his book "Le Pére Goriot: Anatomy of a Troubled World", Martin Kanes calls it "the keystone of the "Comédie humaine"". It is the central text of Anthony Pugh's study "Balzac's Recurring Characters". Entire chapters have been written about the detail of the Maison Vauquer. 

Thus, says Balzac biographer Graham Robb, ""Goriot" is one of the novels of "La Comédie humaine" that can safely be read in English for what it is."

According to the editor of the Norton Critical Edition, Peter Brooks, the book is now seen as "the most endurable and popular of Balzac's myriad works" and a "classic of the [18th]-century European novel".

A well-known line of this book by Balzac is when Vautrin tells Eugene, "In that case I will make you an offer that no one would decline." 

This has been reworked by Mario Puzo in the novel "The Godfather" (1969) and its movie adaptation (1972) as "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse". 

It was ranked as the second most significant cinematic quote in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes (2005) by the American Film Institute.

Phyllodytes megatympanum

Phyllodytes megatympanum is a frog. It lives in Brazil. People have seen it between 90 and 95 meters above sea level.

The skin of the frog's back and legs is light brown. The place where the legs meet the body is yellow. This frog's eardrum is very large. The eardrum is called a tympanum.

This frog lives on bromeliad plants that grow on tree branches. In some parts of Brazil, it also lives in shrubby places. The male frog sits 2 to 10 meters above the ground and calls to the female frogs. The female frog lays eggs on the leaves. When they hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water in the bromeliad plants and then swims and grows in the water.

This frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large area. Although human beings cut down much of the forest where it used to live to make farms and places for animals to eat grass, there is still a large forest space left. Also, human beings have started to grow trees as crops, which is a little better for frogs. Scientists think the frog could be in danger if humans go into their forests to take away the bromeliad plants, but they do not think anyone is actually doing that right now.

The Abstract House (Milan)

The The Abstract House or La Casa Astratta is a palace in Viale Beatrice d'Este 24, Milano, Italy in the historic center of Milan inside the luxurious Quadronno District, which collects artwork of the fifties.

The Palazzo La Casa Abstract was built by Carlo Perogalli and Attilio Mariani together with the painter Francesco Magnelli in 1952. Carlo Perogalli and Attilio Mariani completed the nearby building in Viale Beatrice d'Este 26 in 1952, while Giordano Forti and Camillo Magni in 1957 created the Palazzo Forti, making the whole area an open-air museum. The Abstract House of Viale Beatrice d'Este in Milan is the masterpiece of the Movement for Concrete Art.

The painter Francesco Magnelli, active in Paris, worked with the designers to lay out the facade. The same design is taken up in negative inside the entrance hall with an artistic inlay in the rubber floor with the aim of establishing a close relationship between the facade and the interior space. In the atrium a sculpture was created by Attilio Mariani.

From 1948 to 1958 for architects and artists, Milan became the city where they could experience a new conception of the relationships between the arts. The Palace shows how the concrete forms are not simply paintings applied to the walls of a building designed separately by another person, but are born and developed together with the architecture with which they identify. Perogalli also considers this creation one of the most original and significant in which "the synthesis of the arts ... is also notable for the strong chromatic component: the facade of the building has a cladding in white marble and blue ceramic tiles. The decoration is expressed both in the free composition and in the choice of colors on the facade.

""The façade endowed with movement and plasticity for the protrusions of the balconies and bow windows that the chromatic play enhances: cladding in white marble, mirrors in black ceramic mosaic, balconies in blue ceramic mosaic.""

Attempted assassination of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner

On 1 September 2022 Argentina's former president and current vice president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner had a gun pointed at her head by a man outside her official residence in the neighborhood of Recoleta, Buenos Aires. As the man tried to kill her, the gun failed. No shots were fired. He was arrested on the scene.

On September 1, 2022, at 8:50 p.m. (local time in Argentina), the vice president of Argentina arrived at her home after a session in the Senate. Fernández was signing copies of her book "Sinceramente" outside her home, when Fernando Andrés Sabag Montiel, about 35 years old, pointed a 32-caliber Bersa gun at the president's head. He pulled the trigger twice but none of the magazine's five serviceable cartridges were chambered. The object had a damaged serial number.

Supporters of the vice president gathered at the scene to sing songs in her support.

Fernando Andrés Sabag Montiel is the person who tried to fire at Cristina Fernández. He has a record for carrying a knife. He lives in the La Paternal neighborhood. In photographs of the attacker released by the media, a tattoo of the black sun, a neo-fascist symbol, can be seen on his elbow.
Sabag was quickly arrested by the victim's security and police elements. He was taken to a police tent where he is interrogated. Elements of the Argentine scientific police carried out expert investigations on the site.

Alberto Fernández, president of Argentina, announced that María Eugenia Capuchetti is the judge in charge of the investigations and the prosecutor is Carlos Rívolo.

The president asked the judicial authorities for speed in the clarification as well as to take care of the detainee's life.

For a week, the corner of the vice president's apartment has been in constant presence of sympathetic protesters, this presence responded to the previous presence of opposition protesters, in turn incited in response to a breakthrough in one of the corruption cases linked to Lázaro Báez on August 22.






After the event, several doubts arose from some sectors of the population and the media, due to the way in which the assassination attempt against Fernández was raised. For example, the police had mistakenly broken into a home of the detainee, Sabag Montiel, but his real home had been located after a person showed up at a police station claiming that he had rented it for eight months , citing the serious lack of security on the part of the police to protect Fernández, Sabag Montiel came to aim just a few centimeters from his face.

The attacker posted photos of his tattoos with Nazi symbols, such as the black sun, on Instagram, which generated speculation that if he worked alone or is part of an organization; political scientist Pedro Núñez told DW Español that "the Justice obviously has to act quickly, since the worst that could happen is that this is diluted over time and more and more conspiracy theories appear about what happened."

Some Peronist politicians accused the opposition of promoting "hatred" towards Cristina Kirchner. The former president of Bolivia, Jeanine Áñez, accused Fernández of "self-victimizing" and "blaming" the opposition without any investigation and impose a political holiday. The provincial deputy of Santa Fe, Amalia Granata, said that the attack on Fernández was "armed" and is "a pantomime" to victimize her.

The attack is added to the list of presidents of Argentina who suffered assassination attempts

Cadena nacional

In several Latin American countries, a ' (; plural '), also referred to as a ' () or ' () is a joint transmission through the media, generally radio and television stations, which aims to reach the largest number of inhabitants of a State. These types of broadcasts are usually of a political nature, since they are mostly messages from government authorities about different matters of general interest, as well as the transmission of electoral debates for the elections to the executive power of each country. 

The institutional characteristics of the national chain vary according to the legislation and customs of each country.  It may be a resource officially provided for in legislation or the name may be used informally, to describe a coordinated transmission. The coupling of the different media to the signal of the official chain can also be voluntary or compulsory.  Similarly, the national network can be used for different types of transmissions in addition to the official messages of the State authorities.

During the government of Cristina Kirchner, the number and frequency of "Cadenas Nacionales" increased, some media criticized their use as not limited to cases of "institutional significance".

The then National Senator for Citizen Unity Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, at the presentation of his book "Sinceramente" in Rosario (Argentina), said that "he does not regret the national channels, since otherwise the media would not have shown the public policies of the then President of Argentina". 

During the administration of the President Mauricio Macri, its use decreased.
In Chile, during the period of the Popular Unity, some radio stations (mainly from the opposition), got off the "Cadenas Nacionales" to broadcast their normal programming. At that time they were mandatory.

Another similar situation was the opposition, on the part of the Honduran press, to broadcasting national channels during the government of President Manuel Zelaya, considering that "in the past the "cadena nacional" system was used constantly, mainly by the de facto governments, without satisfactory results".
Mandatory national channels with political content have been strongly criticized by some media, since in some countries they must broadcast content that often differs from their editorial line. 

That was the case of the radio station RCTV in Venezuela, an opponent of Hugo Chávez, which refused to broadcast a message from the ruler in 2007, despite the fact that in said country there is a Law on Social Responsibility in Radio and Television, which obliges radio and television to broadcast information from the Executive Power. Currently, a "Cadena nacional" is broadcast almost every day, normally headed by Nicolás Maduro or Delcy Rodríguez.

The Man of the Hole (; – ), or the Tanaru Indian (), was an indigenous person who lived alone in the Amazon rainforest in the Brazilian state of Rondônia. He was probably the only person living in Tanaru Indigenous Territory. The Brazilian government created that territory was created as a protected indigenous territory in 2007.

It is not known what language the Man of the Hole spoke, what his people called themselves, or what his name was. He was the last surviving member of his people after Brazilian settlers killed the other people of his group in a genocide in the 1970s–1990s. The Man of the hole lived alone from the mid-1990s until his death in 2022. From 1996, the Brazilian Fundação Nacional do Índio (FUNAI) monitored and occasionally interacted with him from a distance, but he otherwise chose to remain isolated. Living primarily by hunting and gathering and moving frequently, he left behind a deep hole of unknown purpose in each of his homes. This was the reason for his nickname. The Man of the Hole survived another attack by an armed rancher in 2009. In 2018, his case attracted international attention when FUNAI released a video of him to raise awareness about the threats uncontacted peoples faced in Brazil.

Los Angeles runway disaster

USAir Flight 1493 was a scheduled commercial flight that was involved in an accident at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on February 1, 1991, colliding with SkyWest Airlines Flight 5569. Both planes caught fire after the impact and 35 of their occupants died, and another 29 were injured, thirteen of them seriously.

The conclusions of the accident investigation carried out by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), established several causes for the accident.

The fact that the ground radar was out of service on the day of the incident was one such root cause, as it would otherwise have been able to detect the presence of the SkyWest aircraft on the runway in time to alert the incoming US Airways flight. Other decisive factors were the lack of synchronicity between the flight progress tabs available to the controllers and the actual position of the aircraft on the airport runways and taxiways, which made the flight aircraft 5569 received incorrect instructions due to its controller's incorrect perception of its location. The poor night lighting of the runways and the glare problems that this lighting caused in the operators of the airport control tower, reducing their ability to see small aircraft during their maneuvers on the taxiways, was another of the determining factors of the Sinister.

The National Transportation Safety Board blamed the airport administration for not having enough staff to handle landings and takeoffs, especially during night operations.

Perceptron

In machine learning, the perceptron (or McCulloch-Pitts neuron) is an algorithm to separate two categories of data with a straight boundary. A list of numbers called the weights describe the boundary.

Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts thought of the perceptron in 1943. Frank Rosenblatt built the first perceptron in 1958.

The algorithm calculates the inner product of a data point and a list of numbers called the weights and then adds another number called the bias. It will group the negative numbers and the positive numbers separately. The algorithm only works if the two groups can be divided with a straight boundary. The groups of data are on opposite sides of the boundary. It can be written as formula_1 where formula_2 is the weights, formula_3 is the data point, and formula_4 is the bias.

Abortion laws

Abortion laws specify under what circumstances a woman can get an abortion. Getting an abortion means that the pregnancy is ended early, without the birth of a child. These laws vary widely, by country, and sometimes by area. They have also changed over time.

As of 2022, about 60% of the people live in a country that allows abortion, under some circumstances. When abortion is legal, it may mean that only part of the reasons are recognized, or that it is only legal for part of the pregnany.

Generally, there are the following options, from the most liberal, to the most restrictive, when a pregancy can be ended:

Common reasons for allowing an abortion:

Abortion is a controversial subject in many societies: People argue in favor or arganist it, using argumrnts from religion, moral and ethical values, or practical or political reasons. Note that legally outlawing abortions will not stop people from getting an abortion: They may get an unsafe abortion, which is riskier than a legal abortion. A study done in 2007 found that abortion rates were similar in countries where abortion was legal, and those countries where it wasn't. Very often, people get an abortion, because they do not have easy access to modern contraceptives. According to the same study, the number of abortions is decreasing, because contraceptives are more commonly available.

The table below lists in chronological order the United Nations member states that have legalized abortion on request in at least some initial part of the pregnancy, or that have fully decriminalized abortion. As of July 2022, 65 countries have legalized or decriminalized abortion on request.

Where a country has legalized abortion on request, prohibited it, and legalized it again (e.g., former Soviet Union, Romania), only the later year is included. Countries that result from the merger of states where abortion on request was legal at the moment of unification show the year when it became legal across the whole national territory (e.g., Germany, Vietnam). Similarly, countries where not all subnational jurisdictions have legalized abortion on request are not included (e.g., leading to the exclusion of Australia, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States). Countries are counted even if they were not yet independent at the time. The year refers to when the relevant law or judicial decision came into force, which may be different from the year when it was approved.

Johann Adolf Hasse

Johann Adolf Hasse (also spelled Johann Adolph Hasse; baptised 25 March 1699 16 December 1783) was a German composer, singer, and music teacher. He was an important opera composer in the 18th century.

Hasse was born in Bergedorf, near Hamburg. His father and grandfather were organists. He studied in Hamburg from 1714 to 1717. In 1718 he joined the Hamburg State Opera. He was a tenor singer. In 1719, he started working in Braunschweig. He performed operas written by Georg Schürmann, Francesco Conti and Antonio Caldara. His own opera, "Antioco", was performed in Brunswick in 1721. It is his only opera which is written in the German language.

He might have left Germany in 1722. He went to Naples. In Naples, he converted (changed his religion) to Catholicism. He learned to write music and counterpoint with Alessandro Scarlatti. Hasse's first opera in Italy was "Il Sesotrate". It was performed on 13 May 1726. The opera was a success. It made him a famous composer and musician.

In 1730 Hasse visited Venice. He married Faustina Bordoni, an opera singer. His opera "Artaserse" was performed there. It was his first opera which uses Metastasio's text. The opera was a success.

He became the "Kapellmeister" of the Dresden court in around 1730. He arrived at Dresden in 1731. His employer was King August II of Poland. He wrote operas and church music in Dresden. In Dresden, he wrote the opera "Cleofide". The opera uses text by Metastasio. Johann Sebastian Bach and his son Wilhelm Friedemann Bach may have watched the opera's first performance. On the next day, Bach performed on the organ. Hasse might have watched Bach play the organ. Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach said that his father and Hasse were good friends.

As part of his job, Hasse did not have to stay in Dresden. From 1733 to 1734 he stayed in Italy. He wrote music for the Ospedale degli Incurabili, an orphanage in Venice. He also went to Vienna. He taught Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria how to sing. Hasse came back to Dresden in December 1733. He wrote new operas. He also wrote some church music. In 1734, the king of Poland went to Warsaw. Hasse went back to Italy. He stayed in Italy until 1737. 

He went back to Dresden in 1740. He wrote the operas "Antigono" and "Ipermestra". The text for these operas were written by Metastasio. Hasse and Metastasio became good friends. They wrote many operas together.

Hasse moved to Venice in 1773. He taught singing and wrote music for the Incurabili. He died in 1783. People forgot about him after he died.

Bride kidnapping

 
Bride kidnapping is when a man abducts the woman he wants to marry. The practice is also known as marriage by abduction or marriage by capture,

Bride kidnapping (which is often shortened to bridenapping) has been practiced around the world, throughout history. Peoples as diverse as the Hmong in Southeast Asia, the Tzeltal in Mexico, and the Romani in Europe have done it.

Bride kidnapping still occurs in different parts of the world. It is most common in the Caucasus and Central Asia.

Most countries see bride kidnapping as a sex crime, and not as a valid form of marriage. In some cases, it is seen somewhere between a forced marriage and an arranged one. 

In many cases, the woman will cooperate with the kidnapper, to save her face, or to save the honour of her family or her parents. 

Many countries also have laws that say that this is not a crime, if the woman later marries the man. Very often, there are also customs, which see bride kidnapping as some form of tradition.

In most nations, bride kidnapping is considered a sex crime because of the implied element of rape, rather than a valid form of marriage. Some types of it may also be seen as falling along the continuum between forced marriage and arranged marriage. The term is sometimes confused with elopements, in which a couple runs away together and seeks the consent of their parents later. In some cases, the woman cooperates with or accedes to the kidnapping, typically in an effort to save face for herself or her parents. In many jurisdictions, this used to be encouraged by so-called marry-your-rapist laws. Even in countries where the practice is against the law, if judicial enforcement is weak, customary law ("traditional practices") may prevail.

Bride kidnapping is often (but not always) a form of child marriage. It may be connected to the practice of bride price, wealth paid by the groom and his family to the bride's parents, and the inability or unwillingness to pay it.

Bride kidnapping is when one man (or a man and his friends) abduct one woman. When this is done on a larger scale (a large group of men abducting many women), this is known as raptio, and different from bride kidnapping. In the 21st century, there have been more cases of war rape, which may have elements of bride kidnapping. Women and girls abducted by groups such as Boko Haram in Nigeria, the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda and ISIS in the Middle East have been taken as wives by their abductors.

In some countries, there are still rituals, which involve a symbolic bride kidnapping as part of a wedding. Some say that the honeymoon is a relic of such a practice: the husband going into hiding with his wife to avoid reprisals from her relatives, with the intention that the woman would be pregnant by the end of the month.

The archipelago is part of the State of Pernambuco, Brazil.
The islands are administratively unique in Brazil. They form a "state district" () that is administered directly by the government of the state of Pernambuco (even though they are closer to the state of Rio Grande do Norte). The state district's jurisdiction also includes the very remote Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, located northeast of Fernando de Noronha. Seventy percent of the islands' area was established in 1988 as a national marine park.

It is about northeast of the Fernando de Noronha islands, from the city of Natal, and from the west coast of Africa. The islets belong to Brazil. They are part of the special "state district" () of Fernando de Noronha, in the state of Pernambuco. Fernando de Noronha is the nearest island.

In total, the archipelago covers an area of about by .

There is a lighthouse, and a research station, with four people. There is no freshwater supply on the islands, so the research station has a water desalination plant.

Only the largest islet, Belmonte, has mosses and grasses on it. The other rocks are mostly barren, except for some sea algae and fungi that can tolerate the salt spray. Seabirds, including the brown booby ("Sula leucogaster"), brown noddy ("Anous stolidus"), and black noddy ("Anous minutus"), as well as crabs ("Grapsus grapsus"), insects, and spiders live on the rocks.

The islands are home to over 100 reef fishes. About 10% of them are found nowhere else in the world, including the very colorful "Tosanoides aphrodite".

Several minor realignments have been made in the areas of the villages of Marcellus and Camillus to accommodate newly built bypasses.

Classical field theory

Classical physics is a group of physics theories that predate modern, more complete, or more widely applicable theories. If a currently accepted theory is considered to be modern, and its introduction represented a major paradigm shift, then the previous theories, or new theories based on the older paradigm, will often be referred to as belonging to the area of "classical physics".

As such, the definition of a classical theory depends on context. Classical physical concepts are often used when modern theories are unnecessarily complex for a particular situation.

Brazing

Brazing is a metal-joining process. Two or more metal items are joined together by melting and flowing a filler metal into the joint. The filler metal has a lower melting point than the adjoining metal.

Brazing differs from welding because it does not melt the work pieces. Brazing differs from soldering because it uses a higher temperature and more closely fitted parts than soldering. 

During the brazing process, the filler metal flows into the gap between close-fitting parts by capillary action. 

The filler metal is brought slightly above its melting temperature. while protected by a suitable atmosphere, usually a flux. It then flows over the base metal and joins the work pieces together. A big advantage of brazing is it can join the same or different metals with considerable strength.

The building is made of bricks and bush-hammered concrete, left exposed strongly influenced by the Rationalist Movement. It is in fact the parapets of the balconies that characterize the facades, through a skilful use of sandblasted bricks that draw geometries that are certainly functional, simple and precise, but not entirely alien to a certain taste for the reinterpretation of traditional elements such as ventilation grids, typical of Lombard farmhouses, to which many of Luigi Caccia Dominioni's contemporary linguistic choices for many Milanese condominiums also refer.
Particular attention is paid to the construction detail, so much so that critics consider the condominium of Maffezzoli and Pellegrini an "exercise of high design expertise and rare sensitivity".

• Design: 1957-1958
• Execution: 1958
• reference date: 1957 - 1958

Palazzo Maffezzoli has a particular architectural, artistic, historical and cultural interest.

Queen Camilla

Camilla (née Shand; formerly Parker Bowles; born 17 July 1947) is Queen Consort of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Commonwealth realms as the wife of King Charles III. 

She became queen on 8 September 2022, after the death of Elizabeth II. Before that, she was known as Duchess of Cornwall.

She was born Camilla Rosemary Shand in King's College Hospital, London. She grew up in Sussex. She has a sister, Annabel Elliot (born 1949) and had a brother, Mark Shand (1951-2014).

From 1973 to 1995, she was married to Andrew Parker Bowles. They had two children: a son, Tom and a daughter, Laura. Tom is married to Sara, and they have a daughter, Lola, born in 2007 and a son, Freddy, born in 2010. Laura is married to Harry Lopes, and has a daughter, Eliza, born in 2008 and two sons, Gus and Louis, born in 2009.

The relationship between Camilla and Prince Charles began when they met at a polo match in 1970. Camilla was seen to be an unsuitable match for the future king. 

During Charles' marriage with Princess Diana, he remained a close friend with Camilla. He also admitted to cheating on Diana with Camilla. This made Camilla upopular with the public for some time. 

Prince Charles and Camilla married each other on 9 April 2005, and she started to be called "Her Royal Highness" The Duchess of Cornwall. 

When their engagement was announced, it was also said that she would not be known as "The Princess of Wales", although she legally held this title as the wife of The Prince of Wales. This decision was made due to the popularity of Prince Charles' first wife, Lady Diana Spencer, who held that title from 1981 until her divorce in 1996. Charles and Diana divorced the year prior to her death. 

The Duchess took many visits, mostly in Great Britain — often with Prince Charles, but sometimes on her own. She lives at Clarence House, which is a part of St James's Palace in London (very close to Buckingham Palace). She lives there with King Charles and his sons, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

Camilla became Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the other commonwealth realms as consort of Charles III on the 8th September 2022 following the death of her mother in law, Elizabeth II. Despite public opposition to her being called Queen as the consort to the King (because of public preference to the late Diana, Princess of Wales) it was announced that she would take the title following the wish of Elizabeth II.

Charles III and Camilla were crowned as King and Queen on 6 May 2023 at Westminster Abbey.


Camilla was also legally The Princess of Wales as the wife of The Prince of Wales from her marriage in 2005 until 8th September 2022. However, it was decided that she would not use this title in practice out of deference to the late Diana, Princess of Wales. From 8th September 2022 until 6th May 2023, Camilla was called "Her Majesty The Queen Consort", even though she could have been simply called Queen.

Death and state funeral of Elizabeth II

Hours before her death was announced, doctors said that her health had been worsening recently and they would watch her health.

At Balmoral Castle in Scotland, on 6 September, two days before her death, the Queen accepted the resignation of Boris Johnson and appointed Liz Truss to replace him as Prime Minister. 

After the Queen's death her oldest son Charles, Prince of Wales, became King of the United Kingdom and fourteen other Commonwealth realms. 

Her state funeral was on 19 September.

Her daughter Princess Anne registered the death certificate of Queen Elizabeth II on 29 September 2022. It said she died of old age.

Journalism sourcing

In journalism, a source or news source is a person, written thing, or other way of getting knowledge gives the reporter information that is new. Sources can be official records, books or other printed works, broadcasts, people who work for governments or businesses, organizations and corporations, people who saw and heard crimes, accidents, or other news, and people to whom a news event or issue is important.

According to Shoemaker (1996) and McQuail (1994), many things can make a source bona fide, or good, or bad. Reporters should build good relationships with sources so that they trust each other, especially if they write about the same kind of thing often. These reporters are called "beat reporters." Beat reporters should also not become close friends with their sources. Journalists should also be skeptical. That means they should wonder whether the source is telling the truth or whether they are lying or wrong. For example, the City News Bureau of Chicago wrote "If your mother says she loves you, check it out." Journalists should not use only one source. Instead, they should find many sources that agree with each other, especially when they are writing about a controversy, or something people might disagree or fight about.

Palace Malchiodi

The The Palace Malchiodi or Palazzo Malchiodi is a palace in Via Anelli 9, Milano, Italy, designed by Gian Carlo Malchiodi adjacent to and in support of an existing masterpiece Palace Crivelli of 1955, in Via Crivelli 9 by Carlo Perogalli and Attilio Mariani, in the historic center of Milan inside the luxurious Quadronno District, which collects the open-air masterpieces of numerous archistars of the fifties.

Gian Carlo Malchiodi who will design other buildings in the same street will decide to later open his own studio in this building, saying he wants to admire his creations every day, where his son Umberto Malchiodi also worked in an area unique in the world for Italian design with masterpieces created on commission from an enlightened Milanese nobility and bourgeoisie of the 1950s that will give birth to Italian design then recognized all over the world.

The Palazzo Malchiodi has the particularity, like the nearby work of Galmanini, of being born with a "double front" being located on the corner between Via Anelli and Via Crivelli, Malchiodi harmonizes two different souls as if they were two distinct buildings that interact with each other, without solving the problem of the corner.

• Design: 1956-1958
• Execution: 1957
• reference date: 1956 - 1957




Palace Tre Torri

The The Palace Tre Torri also known as Palazzo Torri is a residential building designed in 1957 by Gian Carlo Malchiodi located in Via Anelli 13 on the side of Palazzo Maffezoli, in the historic center of Milan inside the Quadronno District, which collects the open-air masterpieces of numerous archistars of the fifties.

This Milanese residential building takes its name from the three characteristic columns of the tower façade that make up the frontispiece, which make up a chessboard with the loggias, alternating full and empty spaces, which communicate with each other through the glass.

The Palazzo di Tre Torri has a particular architectural, artistic, historical and cultural interest.


• Design: 1953-1955
• Execution: 1955
• reference date: 1953 - 1955


Palace Perogalli

The The Palace Perogalli also known as Palazzo Perogalli is a residential building designed in 1952 by Carlo Perogalli and Attilio Mariani in Viale Beatrice d'Este 26, in the historic center of Milan inside the Quadronno District, which collects the open-air masterpieces of numerous archistars of the fifties.

The Palace offers a view of via Anelli and Palazzo Galmanini Portaluppi at the corner of Via Anelli, considered the most important design masterpiece in the area.

Carlo Perogalli and Attilio Mariani also built the adjacent design building in Viale Beatrice d'Este 24 known as The Abstract House.

The Palazzo is like the adjacent building, in support, of La Casa Astratta, an expression of the theories of the MAC-Movimento d'Arte Concreta with a facade that recalls "a rhythmic score based on the alternation of brown and Havana clinker panels, separated from each other by the empty windows and the glossy white of the roller shutter boxes."

Palazzo Perogalli was built a few years after the Abstract House, in which the main element this time is the color which, on the side façade, gives a dynamic effect and breaks the static nature of the wall box through staggered clinker panels of different sizes and alternating colors, orange and brown.

The Palazzo is the first example of Clinker cladding, which will later become one of the "means of expression most used by the Milanese design culture" and will be the inspiration for works by Gio Ponti, Caccia Dominioni, Franco Albini, and Ignazio Gardella "who reflect on the theme of architectural skin composed of flakes of the most varied shapes and shades of color".

This characterization of color is the main element of the building. ""So: the color yes, but with an architectural function, which is to follow the exact path. In this house a fine and minute texture, marked, with a well-known but well-used motif, by the uprights which connect the balconies, is accompanied by a chessboard of two-tone Clinker panels, alternately the same, between these two colors the emptyness of the display case and the white of the lid of the box act as a separation: a pleasant effect certainly"". The side elevation, on the other hand, is clad with litho-ceramic chess patterns alternating between tan and brown colors.

• Design: 1951-1952
• Execution: 1952
• reference date: 1951 - 1952

AGS-17

The AGS-17 "Plamya" is a Soviet automatic grenade launcher that fires a 30x29mm VOG-17M grenade. It was designed in 1968 by Alexander Fedorovich Kornyakov and KB Tochmash. The AGS-17 also is produced in other nations such as Serbia, Ukraine, Vietnam, Finland, China, Bulgaria and Iraq. The AGS-17 was designed to operate from a tripod and support Infantry in either direct fire on indirect fire, it has been seen used as a Mortar in the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine by both sides.

The Plamya has been used in multiple wars, it was first used in the Soviet-Afghan war. It has also been used in other wars such as South African Border war, which was the first time it was used outside Afghanistan. It has also been used in the Gulf War, El Salvador Civil War, Chechen wars, and others.

The AGS-17 has a removable barrel to reduce heat and barrel stress, while it also has a tripod that is able to go up to 75° Angle and down to a -5° Angle. It is able to fire up to 400 rounds a minute. It also has two sights, an iron sight and a mortar-styled sight, but it also has a rail to use a scope and a sight. The Plamya also has a Snail drum that can carry up to 29 rounds of 30x29mm.
Since the AGS fires a 30x29mm VOG-17M round, it also can use other rounds such as the newer VOG-30, which is a newer version of the VOG-17M. The Plamya can also support rounds such as the: IO-30, IO-30TP (For training), VOG-30D, and the VUS-30 which is a smoke grenade. But since 2013, the VOG-17M and VOG-30 have been phased out in favor of the newer VOG-30D. 

The Bulgarian Company Arcus has also made a grenade named the AR-ROG, which is based on the VOG-17 to be used as a hand grenade.

The purpose of the AGS-17 is to provide indirect and direct support. It has been seen used as a mortar in Ukraine, it has been seen also creating deathzones that cut off the enemy from a certain area. The AGS-17's design allows it to be used as a mortar due to it being able to go up to 75 degrees up. It has also been used to fight against vehicles that have little to no armor. The AGS-17 can be attached to other vehicles for better performance. The design of the AGS-17 also allows it to also be used to target fortifications, they are capable of destroying sand bags, and other types of fortifications.

In 1960, the United States Army made the Mk.19, an Automatic Grenade Launcher that was used in the Vietnam War. It fired the powerful 40mm HE Grenade. It was proven effective in the war. The Soviet Union needed something to one-up this new design, so they made the AGS-17 with the help of Alexander Fedorovich Kornyakov and OKB-16 in 1968, but production would actually started in 1971. The Red Army tested the weapon in 1969, then started using it in 1971.

The Soviet-Afghan War started in December, 1979. But before the war started, the Afghan People's Republic was formed after the 1978 coup by Nur Mohammad Taraki, they started a series of radical reforms that modernized the nation. They supressed any opposition from local Afghan Muslims, they arrested and executed over 27,000 protesters. It would later cause rebellions to occur April 1979. The Afghan Government called for support against the rebellion. 

The 40th Army under Leonid Brezhnev arrived to Kabul in December 27, 1979. they caused a coup which they killed the president and made a new one under Babrak Karmal, Soviet Troops later occupied large parts of Afghanistan, which caused the Mujahideen to fight a guerilla war against the Soviet Army.

The AGS-17 saw service in the Soviet-Afghan War, it was used by both sides as Mujahideen captured some. It was used on Vehicles and Helicopters, and BTR Series IFVs. With every Platoon having an AGS-17 Squad, it was proved effective.

When the Soviet Union was dissolved on December 26th, 1991; The Chechens were not officially independent, being a de-facto recognized state. In 1993, the Chechen Republic declared independence. On December 11th, 1994, the Russian Armed Forces launched an attack to capture Grozny. The Battle of Dolinskoye was the first ever battle that had multiple Russian Casualties, then the Battle of Khankala which the Russians won and closed into Grozny, the Chechen Insurgents set up defensive positions in Grozny and waited for the Russians.

During both of the Chechen Wars, the AGS-17 saw action by both sides. Chechen Mobile Friring Groups used the AGS-17 as a mortar and also as a support weapon thanks to it's design, the Chechens also found it useful in the battle of Grozny, and others battles in the wars. The Chechens also used the AGS-17 on Toyota Hiluxs. But with the Russians, every battalion had an AGS-17 Platoon, the platoon consisted of an AGS-17 squad, an antitank squad, and also an RPO flamethrower squad. Every platoon also had one forward observer that allowed it to be used as a mortar.

In 2011, the Bashaar Regime brutally cracked down on protests during the Arab Spring. The People responded by rebelling and firing back, while some members in the Syrian Arab Armed Forces defected and formed the Free Syrian Army and later on the Syrian National Army. The Free Syrian Army at first controlled most of the Nation, but later on the Free Syrian Army lost most their lands and later became more of an insurgent group. The Syrian Arab Armed Forces have been seen using the AGS-17. The Syrian Republican Guard has been seen using the AGS-17.

In 2014, the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhank's People Republic declared independence, which caused the Donbas conflict, the Russian Armed Forces fought and supported the separatists. And later on, the Russian Armed Forces invaded Crimea and later on annexed it. In February 24th, 2022; The Russian Federation invaded the Republic of Ukraine from Belarus, Crimea, and the Donbas. 

The AGS-17 has been seen used as a mortar by both sides. The Ukraininans use the RGSh-30, a variant of the AGS-17. The AGS-30 and AGS-40 were also seen in the war. The AGS has been preferred by both sides due to its design and and it's purpose and how it executes it.

The first time the AGS-17 was ever used outside of Russia was in the South Africa Border war. The 32 Battalion, one of South Africa's most elite units used the AGS-17 in Angola. The South African Government bought some AGS-17s. Other wars also Included the Gulf War, El Salvador Civil War, Iraq War, Yemeni Civil War, Ivorian Civil War, Sudanese Civil Wars, and the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War.

The AGS-17 has two major variants, the AGS-17A, a remote controlled AGS-17 that is used on Vehicles. While the AGS-17D is also a remote controlled variant but it is used on helicopters. The AGS-17D was more used in Afghanistan, while the AGS-17A has been used more in Chechnya due to the environment. Afghanistan is more mountainous while Chechnya is more urban.

The RGSh-30 is the Ukrainian variant of the AGS-17, it has been used in the Donbas War and the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine. It is a hand held version of the AGS-17 and fires 25mm, 30mm and 40mm HE grenades, the RGSh-30 also uses the VOG-17. The weapon was made between 2007 and 2008, it has been used in the Donbas War and the Invasion of Crimea. It has a picatinny rail, short barrel and a muzzle brake. It serves the same purpose as the AGS-17, as it is meant to disable vehicles and support infantry.

The QLZ-87 is the Chinese variant of the AGS-17, it was first produced in the late 80s by Xiafeng Machinery and Nirinco. It is heavily inspired by the AGS-17, as it uses a somewhat similar round, the 35mm. Itz has it's own variant, the QLB-06, a lighter handheld version of the QLZ-87. The CCP purchased AGS-17s from the Mujahideen, who had been fighting the Soviet Union.

Green bromeliad frog

The green bromeliad frog, Jamaican green tree frog, or Wilder's tree frog ("Osteopilus wilderi") is a frog. It lives in Jamaica. Scientists have seen between 120 and 880 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is 24.3 to 27.9 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 24.2 to 29.2 mm long. There is no webbed skin on the front feet and a little webbed skin on the back feet. This frog is usually yellow-green in color but it can be red-brown in color. The belly is lighter in color. Some frogs have spots on their sides.

This frog lives in bromeliad plants. Bromeliads are plants that can live on the ground or high up on other plants. Rainwater collects in the leaves of the bromeliads. The frogs lay their eggs in this water. The first tadpoles to hatch eat the other eggs. Scientists think the tadpoles may also eat each other. "Osteopilus brunneus" tadpoles do eat green bromeliad frog tadpoles if they are in the same plant. But "Osteopilus brunneus" lays its eggs in larger bromeliad plants, and the green bromeliad frog lays its eggs in smaller ones. Scientists think green bromeliad frogs do this so that the "Osteopilus brunneus" tadpoles will not eat their young.

The green bromeliad frog lives in tropical forests and subtropical forests.

The adult frog eats insects. It eats leafhoppers.

This frog is in some danger of dying out. This is because human beings cut down the forests where they live to build houses and to collect wood for building.

Discourses on Livy

The Discourses on Livy, also Discourses or Discorsi, was written around 1517 and published in 1531 by Niccolò Machiavelli. 

It is a discussion about the history of early Ancient Rome. Although it strays very far from this and also uses modern political examples to illustrate points. Machiavelli presents it as a series of lessons on how a republic should be started and structured. 

While it more openly explains the advantages of republics, it also has many similar themes from his other works. For example, Machiavelli said that to save a republic from corruption, it is needed to return it to a "kingly state" using violent means. He excuses Romulus for killing his brother Remus and co-ruler Titus Tatius to gain absolute power for himself in that he made a "civil way of life". Commentators disagree about how much the two works agree with each other, as Machiavelli often refers to leaders of republics as "princes". Machiavelli even sometimes acts as an advisor to tyrants. Other scholars have pointed out the power-hungry and imperialistic features of Machiavelli's republic. Nevertheless, it became one of the central texts of modern republicanism.

Product rule

In differential calculus, the product rule is a rule that helps calculate derivates that have multiplication.

formula_1

formula_2.

Say we have the function formula_3.

The two functions being multiplied are formula_4 and formula_5.

We can set

formula_6 and

formula_7.

The rule needs us to find the derivative of both formula_8 and formula_9.

We can find formula_10 by first using the sum rule to split formula_8 into formula_12 and formula_13. After using the power rule, we have formula_14.

To find formula_15, we need to find the derivative of formula_5, which is formula_17, meaning formula_18.

Now we can substitute the values into the equation,

formula_19.

One definition of a derivative is

formula_20, and we're trying to find the derivative of formula_21, so we can first set formula_22 to formula_21.

formula_24

We can't really do much with this so we need to manipulate the equation.

formula_25

The formula_26 part is equal to formula_27, meaning it didn't change the value of the equation. Now we can factor,

formula_28, and because formula_29 approaches formula_27, formula_31 is equal to formula_32.

formula_33, and formula_34 and formula_35 are just equal to formula_15and formula_37.

formula_2.

Are gleaming with a thousand eyes,
Blending in witching harmonies ;
And grassy knoll and forest height,
Are flushing in the rosy light,
And all above is azure bright — Australia!

There is a land where honey flows,
Where laughing corn luxuriant grows,
Land of the myrtle and the rose;
On hill and plain the clust'ring vine
Is gushing out with purple wine,
And cups are quaffed to thee and thine — Australia!

There is a land where treasures shine
Deep in the dark unfathom'd mine
For worshippers at Mammon's shrine;
Where gold lies hid, and rubies gleam,
And fabled wealth no more doth seem
The idle fancy of a dream — Australia!

There is a land where homesteads peep
From sunny plain and woodland steep,
And love and joy bright vigils keep;
Where the glad voice of childish glee
Is mingling with the melody
Of nature's hidden minstrelsy — Australia!

There is a land where, floating free,
From mountain-top to girdling sea,
A proud flag waves exultingly;
And FREEDOM'S sons the banner bear,
No shackled slave can breathe the air,
Fairest of Britain's daughters fair — Australia!</poem>

Doctor Khumalo

Theophilus "Doctor" Doctorson Khumalo (born 26 June 1967), also known as Doctor Khumalo, is a South African former soccer player. He is best known for being a star midfielder for Kaizer Chiefs as well as the South African national team. Khumalo is regarded as one of the best South African midfielders of his generation. He was known as a strong player who stood out for his leadership, his passing ability, dribbling, tackling, and his ability to score a goal. He won the 1996 African Cup of Nations with South Africa beating Tunisia with the score 2-0. He was named South African Footballer of the Year in 1992. His nickname was "Doctor" because of his intellingence in midfield. Considered to be one of the greatest players in the history of Kaizer Chiefs.

Khumalo started playing football in 1984 with Swallows Reserves, Khumalo then went to Kaizer Chiefs, where he initially played for the junior team. His father, Eliakim Khumalo, a renowned player of the 1970s and early 1980s, served as his mentor. Khumalo was promoted to the senior team by coach Ted Dumitru the following year, when he started a game against arch rivals Orlando Pirates.

Khumalo went on to become a star player for Kaizer Chiefs and did not play for any other South African soccer club, only leaving them for short overseas playing periods – he signed with FIFA agent Marcelo Houseman who first took him to Argentinian club Ferro Carril Oeste for six months in 1995, while in 1996 and 1997 he played for the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer.

The high-point of Khumalo's soccer career was the 1990s; he was part of the Kaizer Chiefs teams that won three South African league championship titles and five knockout trophies and he was also voted South African Footballer of the Year in 1992. During his career at the club, he played in a total of 397 league and cup games, scoring 75 goals.

After the re-admission of South Africa to FIFA in 1992, Khumalo was selected to be a member of the South African squad for its first official international match in July of the same year, against Cameroon. South Africa won the match 1–0, due to a penalty scored by Khumalo. He was also a leading member of the winning South African national team at the 1996 African Cup of Nations . He also represented South Africa in the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Throughout his whole international career, he played for South Africa 50 times (twice as captain), scoring nine goals making him the 13th most capped South African footballer. Khumalo turned down a chance to play for the 1998 and 2000 African Cup of Nations. He made his international farewell in 2001. 

One of Doctor Khumalo's most memorable games was perhaps the 1996 Mandela Cup match, where South Africa played against Brazil. Phil Masinga scored the first goal from Doctor Khumalo's corner kick. Khumalo then scored the second goal to make the score 2–0 in favour of the South Africans. Unfortunately for Bafana, Brazil came back in the second half, scoring three goals, to win the encounter 3–2.

He retired in 2002 and then in 2004 as a player-coach.

"Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules" was produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Bardel Entertainment, with the latter providing animation services, and it was released on Disney+, as a Disney+ original film, on December 2, 2022. Like its predecessor, it received mixed reviews. 

Greg's parents reveal that they are going away for the weekend and taking Manny with them. Rodrick takes advantage of this and informs Greg that they are throwing a party together. Greg invites Rowley over to help, but they both end up doing all the work while Rodrick sits and watches. He locks them in the basement during the party, but Greg loosens the doorknob and takes photos of the party as blackmail. In the morning, they are let out and Rowley runs home while Greg confronts Rodrick over what happened. They suddenly get a call from their mother Susan, who informs them that Manny got sick and they are coming home right away. The brothers quickly clean up the house and kick out leftover guests before switching the bathroom door, which has the words 'Rodrick Rules' permanently written on it, with Rodrick's door, though Frank later notices that the door does not lock properly.

Following the incident, Greg demands Rodrick give him advice in return for helping clean up the party. Rodrick gives in and tells him about his "Rodrick Rules" which deal with getting things done without making an effort. Greg quickly becomes impatient, but is calmed down when Rodrick teaches him how to play the drums. Greg meets his fellow bandmates of Löded Diper, one of whom is actually a 30-something year old man, who are going to enter a talent show. Greg is also in it, but is assisting Rowley with his magic act, something which he does not think will be a hit. Frank suspects that the boys are hiding something, but Susan is happy to see them getting along. When Frank asks about the door, Greg covers and claims that he accidentally slammed it too hard, explaining why it does not lock properly. Frank and Susan are going away for the weekend again, but this time, they will leave the boys with Grandpa at the nursing home, which Rodrick seems overly eager about.

At the nursing home, Rodrick reveals that the board games contain plenty of mom bucks they can use back at home. He gives some to Greg, but his pants get wet during a game and he is forced to change in the lobby bathroom. Greg accidentally ends up in the women's room where he gets accused of being a peeping tom. A chase through the old folks home ensues, but he manages to get back to the room. Later, Grandpa tells Greg that he knows that he and Rodrick did not want to come, but he admires that they hang out, something that Frank fails to do with his siblings. The next school day, Rowley reminds Greg that he needed to do his life science project and he rushes to Rodrick for help. He gives him his old life science project on the condition that he hand over some mom bucks. Greg does so, but upon arriving at school realizes that it is a failed project about plants sneezing.

Greg angrily reveals his blackmail to Rodrick and demands he pay up in mom bucks. However, he accidentally bumps into Susan who sees the photos and grounds both boys, though Greg is still forced to do the talent show with Rowley. As payback, Rodrick reveals that he took photos of the pictures in Greg's diary about the restroom incident and threatens to send them to his friends who will send them to their siblings. They get the phone away from Rodrick, but Rowley accidentally sends the photos. To Greg's surprise, the story at school got twisted to being about Greg winning the top prize at a bingo competition and making a big getaway, making him popular. Greg is still depressed however as he has to do the talent show with Rowley, but just before entering, Löded Diper approaches Greg about being their new drummer, as their replacement drummer Larry loves magic and would not mind switching places with him.

Greg starts to question whether he should drum or not, but after Rodrick makes a scathing remark to him, he agrees. Upon seeing Rodrick solemnly leaving the show, Greg goes out to talk to him and explains that he simply wanted him to be proud of him and was worried they will grow apart. Rodrick tells Greg that he does care about him and that they will continue to hang out together. Greg gives Rodrick his position as drummer back, despite him still being grounded, and returns to Löded Diper. Frank and Susan extend Greg's grounding, but Grandpa commends Frank for raising two good brothers while Susan excitedly dances to the band's song. Rowley's magic show ends up winning the competition while Löded Diper gains a wider audience thanks to Susan. Despite their differences, Greg and Rodrick's relationship improves.


On December 3, 2021, Kinney stated that he intends to adapt all his books into animated features for Disney+.

Lisa del Giocondo

Lisa del Giocondo (15 June 1479 – 15 July 1542) was an Italian noblewoman and a member of the Gherardini family from Florence. She was the model for the Mona Lisa portrait. The portrait was commissioned by her husband and painted by Leonardo da Vinci during the Italian Renaissance.

Born in Florence and she married when she was young to a cloth and silk merchant who later became a local official. They had five children together, and she lived a comfortable and ordinary life. Lisa outlived her much older husband.

After Lisa died, the Mona Lisa became the most famous painting in the world. In 2005, it was confirmed that Lisa was indeed the model for the Mona Lisa.

Giocondo's family in Florence used to be rich and important, but as time passed, their power and status declined. They had a decent income from farming, but they weren't rich. This was in a city where some people were very rich and others were not.

Lisa's father, Antonmaria di Noldo Gherardini, came from a family that had lived near San Donato in Poggio and had just moved to the city. Gherardini used to own or rent six farms in Chianti. These farms made wheat, wine, olive oil, and raised animals.

Gherardini had two wives, Lisa di Giovanni Filippo de' Carducci, whom he married in 1465, and Caterina di Mariotto Rucellai, whom he married in 1473, but, both wives died during childbirth. Lisa's mother was Lucrezia del Caccia, daughter of Piera Spinelli, and she became Gherardini's wife through his third marriage in 1476.

Lisa was born on June 15, 1479, in Via Maggio, even though some people used to think she was born at their family's rural property near Greve called Villa Vignamaggio. She was named after her grandfather's wife, also named Lisa. Lisa was the oldest of seven children, with three sisters, including one named Ginevra, and three brothers, Giovangualberto, Francesco, and Noldo.

At the age of fifteen she married Francesco di Bartolomeo di Zanobi del Giocondo, a cloth and silk merchant in 1495. As a dowry she brought 170 florins and the farm San Silvestro. She had five children: Piero, Piera, Camilla, Marietta, and Andrea. In 1521 their daughter Marietta became one of the Roman Catholic nuns in the renowned monastery of Sant'Orsola. When her husband died of the plague in 1538, Lisa also went to live in that monastery. She lived there for several years and was buried there.

Francesco and his family were passionate about art. They hired various artists for different commissions. They asked Antonio di Donnino Mazzieri to paint a fresco in their family burial place. Andrea del Sarto painted a Madonna for another family member, and Francesco even hired Leonardo to paint a portrait of his wife, Lisa. The Mona Lisa, which is now famous, was created as a portrayal of a virtuous woman. Lisa is shown as a faithful wife with her right hand resting over her left. Leonardo made her look fashionable and well-off, wearing Spanish-influenced high-fashion clothing. The portrait's size was quite extravagant, matching the standards of wealthier art patrons of that era.

In 1503, Leonardo needed money, so he worked on the Mona Lisa, but he had to pause when he received a more valuable commission for "The Battle of Anghiari" later that year. In 1506, he considered the portrait unfinished, wasn't paid for it, and didn't give it to the client. He likely completed it years later in France.

The title "Mona Lisa" came about in 1550 when Giorgio Vasari, who knew Francesco's family, mentioned that Leonardo painted it for Francesco del Giocondo, Lisa's husband. In Italian, it's called "La Gioconda," the feminine form of her married name. In French, it's known as "La Joconde," which also carries the meaning of "the happy one", derived from the word "jocund".

Sacrifice to Heaven

Sacrifice to Heaven (Jitian 祭天) is the worship of Shangdi originating in China. In Ancient Chinese society, nobles of all levels constructed altars for Heaven. At first only nobles could worship Shangdi but later beliefs changed and everyone could worship Shangdi.

Modern Confucian organizations offer this practice to all their followers, and it's still observed in China even though there is no monarch. This tradition has also had an impact on other countries such as Japan, Vietnam, and Korea. The Chinese word "Jì" (祭) in the name of this practice is the same word as "Jesa" in Korean.

This practice has its roots in the Shang dynasty, but during the Zhou dynasty, it was only allowed for the Son of Heaven due to the teachings of Shendao shejiao. Two specific sacrifices, Sacrifice to Heaven and Feng Shan, were exclusive privileges during that time. The Temple of Heaven has been the location for this ritual since the Ming dynasty, and it still takes place there today.

Some people think that Qing's involvement in the ritual resulted in the standardization of Manchu rituals through the book of Manchu rites, but this theory is not supported. In the early years of the Republic of China, Kang Youwei's Confucian movement proposed separating Religious Confucianism from the state bureaucracy, so anyone could perform the Sacrifice to Heaven as per the Christian model.

Nowadays, this ritual is performed without a monarch, and it can take place at locations other than the Temple of Heaven. For example, it was performed in Fujian in 2015.

In Korea, Sacrifice to Heaven is read as Jecheon (Hanja: 祭天). It is also identified with the word yeonggo 영고 (迎鼓) and has a history linked to Korean shamanism, in addition to Chinese influence

In Japan Sacrifice to Heaven is called "Saiten" (祭天) . It is done for Amaterasu rather than Shangdi though.

Every year, the festival of Niiname-no-Matsuri (新嘗祭) happens and most peopledo not know it has Chinese origins. The first Niiname-no-Matsuri of the reign of an Emperor is called a Daijosai.

In Vietnam Sacrifice to Heaven is called Nam Giao.

It was first done by Emperor Đinh Bộ Lĩnh.

Nam Giao was the most important ritual of the Nguyễn dynasty.

In the Nguyen Dynasty, the Esplanade of Sacrifice to the Heaven and Earth was made to sacrifice to heaven It was made in 1807 and sacrifices were done there until 1945 In 2002 people started doing it again. It is done in Festival Huế every two years.

Bihu

Bihu is the most prominent festival celebrated by the people of Assam. It is a set of three celebrations performed throughout the year. The three Bihus are celebrated at different times of year, in the months of Bohaag (Baisakhi), Kaati (Kartik) and Maagh, according to Hindu calendar. As per modern calendar these days fall in the month of mid April, October/ November and early January.

Assam is a small state in the north-eastern part of the country. Its economy is mainly based on agriculture. The inhabitants of Assam are known agrarians from ages. Hence all their daily activities and celebrations are agriculture oriented only. Bihu is also one of such festivals. It is very much evident from the months of celebration of this festival that these months are actually significant in relation with farming of native crop of Assam, the paddy. Bohaag bihu is celebrated at the seeding time of paddy. Kaati bihu is celebrated when the sowing of paddy is complete and the transformation of the saplings is done. Maagh bihu represents the culmination of the harvesting period of the crop.

The word bihu is derived from the language of ‘dimasa kacharis’, which is the agricultural community of Assam, since ages. The word was originally ‘Bishu’, which meant ‘to ask for prosperity’ from the tribal god. Bihu is the distorted version of Bishu.

Bohaag bihu is also known as Rongali bihu and celebrated with the highest joy and mirth among all the three bihus. As stated it is the commencement time of the new season of farming. But along with, Bohaag is the first month according to Assamese calendar. Hence it is also celebrated as the New Year festival. This period also marks the transition in the seasonal cycle and people greet the coming season of spring with enthusiasm. Rongali bihu is celebrated over a period of 7 days. There are various phases and significance of the respective 7 days of the bihu. The first day is known as goru bihu (cows are washed and worshipped). This is followed by manuha bihu (human beings take early day bath and wear new attire). Then on third day deities are worshipped and washed. Hence the festival stretches over a span of time and the celebrations culminate by bidding adieu to bihu on the last day of festival.

Kati bihu is also known as kongali bihu. It is celebrated with solidarity. However, the celebrations are quietest of all the three bihus. The farmers are busy in their paddy fields and earthen lamps are lit to mark the celebrations. Farmers pray for a better crop during this time of the farming cycle.

Maagh bihu is also known as Bhogaali bihu. Bhogalli means eating and enjoyment. Hence the name itself implies the mood of the festival. Men folk prepare cottages in the barren fields after harvesting of the crops and spend whole night while singing and dancing in communion. Delicious food and sweets are exchanged among the people. In the very next morning, the cottage is lit up in fire and this brings an end to yearly festival of bihu.

It is quite evident that bihu is a festival of farming community whose livelihood is mainly dependent upon the agriculture. The festival of bihu is celebrated by one and all in Assam. The boundaries of rich or poor, cast creed etc. are diminished in the dazzling light of joy and merriment.

Reference Daily Intake

The Reference Daily Intake (often shortened to RDI) is a system for labeling food. It is mostly used in the United States and Canada. It gives the quantity of a nutrient that most healthy people will need in a day. The value given usually satisfied the needs for well over 90% of the healthy adults. At the start, it was developed for the United States. Other countries have started 

The RDI is used to determine the Daily Value (DV) of foods. In the United States and Canada, this information can be found on food labels (as % DV). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by Health Canada require that this information is present. The labels "high", "rich in", or "excellent source of" may be used for a food if it contains 20% or more of the RDI. The labels "good source", "contains", or "provides" may be used on a food if it contains between 10% and 20% of the RDI.

The system of labeling was first introduced in 1968, and has been adapted since then.

School meal

Many schools are organized in such a way that they last all day. Very often, the break at midday is too short for the children to return home, to get a hot meal. So these schools serve hot meals (also called school meals, or hot lunches) at noon. Because they are only for the students, teachers and staff, some form of identification may be required to get in.Bigger schools have often adapted, so that the people get different menus to choose from. Common choices are vegetarian meals, or gluten-free ones. Also because the target group is limited, the meals are either provided free of charge (as their cost is covered elsewhere), or at a cheap price. Sometimes high-energy food is provided as well.

The ideas for providing school meals may be different from country to country: In highly developed countries, the school meal is a good source of nutrients. In less developed countries, offering a school meal (free of charge) may be a reason to send children to school and continue their education. They help children become healthy and productive adults. With this they break the cycle of poverty and hunger.

The first school lunches were served in Munich, in 1790. An A physicist from America, Benjamin Thomsom, also known as Count Rumford, startted them. Thomson founded the Poor people's institute, to make clothing, mostly uniforms for the German army. He employed adults and children. In exchange for the work the people working there were giben clothing, and free meals. The children were also taught how to read and write, and how to do some basic mathematics. Years later, Thomsom operated a soup kitchen in London, where he would feed 60.000 people a day. Thomson did a lor for feeding the poor i Europe; he is crediited with being the first to serve potatoes to these people. He also invented or improved many of the machines which are still used in large kitchens today. 

In the United Kingdom, many changes have been made since school meals were introduced in the 19th century. The first National School Meals Policy was published across the United Kingdom in 1941. This policy set the first nutritional guidelines for school lunches, requiring balanced meals which include the appropriate levels of protein, fat, and calories.

In the United States, there was a gap during the industrial era. Poor children were suffering from malnutrition and hunger due to a low income of the families. Philadelphia and Boston were the first two cities to introduce school lunches in the U.S. Organizations such as Women's Education and the Starr Center Association began serving hot meals to students for an affordable cost. Soon, teachers noticed the benefits of students both mentally and physically. The federal government wasn't involved until the Great Depression (1920s), farmers and labors weren't doing well financially and the school lunch program was a solution that benefited everyone.

In recent years, school districts have faced government or community pressure to change the foods served in schools. The addition of vegan school lunch and Meatless Mondays are examples of these changes.

There are generally two types of school meals:


Sweden, Finland, Estonia and India are among the few countries which provide free school meals to all pupils in compulsory education, regardless of their ability to pay. Many countries provide meals to improve attendance rates. In India, where all the Government School students are provided with free lunch meals through the Midday Meal Scheme, staple food that varies between different states and regions is provided along with free education.

In high-income countries, free meals are usually available only to children who meet income-based criteria.

A study of a free school meal program in the United States found that providing free meals to elementary and middle school children in areas characterized by high food insecurity led to better school discipline among the students.

Reduced price meals are also available in some countries to those who need a degree of assistance with costs. Lower-cost meals are available to students in such countries as France, Italy, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.

Siberians

The Siberians or Siberiaks (, ) are the major residents of Siberia, as well as the (sub)ethnic or ethnographic group of the Russians.

The word "Siberians" is used for all people who live in Siberia. These include both indigenous peoples and the European diaspora (the Russians, Ukrainians, Balts, Finnic and other peoples).

In ethnology the term is often used to refer to the Old-Timers ("Starozhily" or old settlers ) - the earliest Russian population of Siberia during its Russian conquest in the 16th–17th centuries and their descendants. Later settlers, especially from the second half of the 19th – early 20th centuries, were called "the Russian" ( "Raseyskie") by the Siberians.

The dialects of the Siberians were created mainly on the basis of Northern Russian dialects.
Siberian regionalism (Siberian nationalism) considered the Siberians to be a separate people from the Russians. Among ethnologists there are both opponents and supporters of this point of view. In 1918, under the control of the Siberian regionalists, there was a short-lived state formation "Siberian Republic".
In the 2002 and 2010 Russian Census, the ethnonym "Siberiak" was indicated as the main one by a small number of those who responded.

Oblasts of Russia

An oblast () is a type of federal subject of the Russian Federation.
Oblasts are political entities in a federal union. They have representation in the Federation Council. They serve as a first-level administrative division. Each oblast has a state government. It has control over its territory. They have a state legislature, the "Oblast Duma". It is democratically elected. The Governor is the highest executive position of an oblast. He/she is elected by its people. 
Oblasts are divided into "raions" (districts), cities of oblast significance (district-equivalent independent cities), and autonomous okrugs. These are legally federal subjects equal to an oblast but are different from others. Two oblasts have autonomous okrugs: Arkhangelsk Oblast (Nenets Autonomous Okrug) and Tyumen Oblast (Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug).
The term "oblast" can be translated into English as "province" or "region". There are currently 46 oblasts (48 if counting Kherson and Zaporozhye oblasts, which are internationally recognised as a part of Ukraine). It is the most common type of the 85 federal subjects of Russia. Most oblasts are named after their administrative center. It is the official term for a capital city in an oblast, which is usually the largest city. Exceptions to this include Leningrad Oblast and Moscow Oblast, which have no official capital. Sakhalin Oblast is named after an island. Leningrad Oblast and Sverdlovsk Oblast keep the old names of Saint Petersburg and Yekaterinburg. 

Oblasts are usually areas that are mostly populated by ethnic Russians and native speakers of the Russian language. They are mostly located in European Russia. 
The largest oblast by size is Tyumen Oblast at 1,435,200 km (when excluding autonomous okrugs Irkutsk Oblast is the largest at 767,900 km) and the smallest is Kaliningrad Oblast at 15,100 km. The most populous oblast is Moscow Oblast at 7,095,120 and the least populous is Magadan Oblast at 156,996.

In the Russian Empire, oblasts were a third-level administrative division. It was created in 1849. Oblasts split the larger "guberniyas" (governorates) within the first-level krais. 
After the many changes during the Soviet era, the number of oblasts went up as they became the top-level administrative divisions of the Soviet Socialist Republics (SSRs). These oblasts held very little autonomy or power. 
When the Soviet Union dissolved into sovereign states along the lines of the SSRs, they became the first-level administrative divisions. The oblasts of the Russian SFSR, which turned into the Russian Federation, became the first-level administrative divisions of the new country. They received greater devolved power.

On September 30, 2022, Russia annexed the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts of Ukraine after a controversial referendum. These four regions are internationally recognized as part of Ukraine.

Republics of Russia

In Russia, republics are a type of federal subject. They were originally created as nation states for non-Russian ethnic groups, but have since lost most of their autonomy.

On 18 March 2014, Russia annexed the Autonomous Republic of Crimea of Ukraine after an unrecognized referendum.The peninsula became the Republic of Crimea, the 22nd republic of Russia. However, Ukraine and most of the international community do not recognize Crimea's annexation. United Nations General Assembly declared the vote to be illegitimate.

On 24 February 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine and took large areas of southern and eastern Ukraine. As early as March leaders in the unrecognized Luhansk People's Republic and Donetsk People's Republic both said their wish to join Russia, originally once Russia captured all their claimed territory. However, after quick Ukrainian gains in the east in September, Russia and the unrecognized republics rushed a series of referendums on annexation to Russia. The referendum results claimed a large majority supported annexation. On 30 September 2022, Putin formally announced the annexation of the two republics. However, the referendums were recognized internationally as a sham while the European Union and G7 said they were illegal. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the annexations as a violation of the UN Charter.

Kherson Oblast, another region annexed by Russia, was originally thought to be upgrading itself to a "people's republic", according to United States intelligence. However, it never happened, and by the time of the referendums in late September 2022, Kherson's status in Russia stayed unmentioned. When Kherson was annexed, along with neighbouring Zaporizhzhia Oblast, they became oblasts instead of republics.

Lucas Radebe

Lucas Valeriu Ntuba Radebe OIS (born 12 April 1969) is a South African former professional footballer. He began playing in South Africa with Kaizer Chiefs, before transferring to Leeds United, where he played 256 matches for the Yorkshire side. He picked up the nicknames "Rhoo" and "The Chief". He became captain of Leeds United and also of the South African national team, most notably at World Cup 2002. Nelson Mandela said of Radebe: "This is my hero." He also captained Kaizer Chiefs. He played as a centre back. Thebe Mabanga, a Mail & Guardian journalist, wrote that South African fans remember Radebe in his Kaizer Chiefs days as "a lanky, flamboyant central midfielder who switched to central defence with ease, snuffing out any opposition threat with exquisite, acrobatic scissor kicks and diving headers, and man-marking the most lethal strikers into silence". He is considered as one of the best South Africa's centre-backs of all time.

In 1989 Lucas Radebe signed a contract with Kaizer Chiefs. Instead of the goalkeeper position, he came here to play as a midfielder. He would later be dragged back one line, taking on the role of central defender. He would continue to do this for the rest of his career. He soon became a permanent fixture at the club. Lucas Radebe achieved many successes with Kaizer Chiefs. He was called up for the first time in 1992 to be part of the national selection of South Africa and also made his debut that year. He also became champion of South Africa twice with Kaizer Chiefs, in 1991 and 1992. He also won the BP Top 8 three times., now called MTN 8. This is a kind of supercup, in which the eight best performing teams of the past season participate.

In his own words, it was because of his good game that he was shot in 1991. Despite not being seriously injured, he was out for a while. Partly because of the shooting incident, Lucas Radebe decided to leave South Africa in 1994 and sign a contract with a European club. In total, he played 113 games for Kaizer Chiefs. He was able to score five times.

In 1994 Lucas Radebe signed a contract with Leeds United . The club paid a transfer fee of £250,000 to Kaizer Chiefs to bring Radebe to England. That season, fellow countryman of Radebe, Phil Masinga, was also bought by Leeds. He did not come from Kaizer Chiefs, but from Mamelodi Sundowns. The South African duo's first season with the club was an immediate success with a fifth place, which gave the right to European football. Radebe only played twelve games that season. It took until the 1996–97 season before Radebe actually got a permanent base place.

In the end, Lucas Radebe was named captain of the club. He was also nicknamed "The Chief", partly because of his previous club and partly because of his leadership qualities. Five years in a row, from 1998 to 2002, Radebe finished in the top five of the Premier League with Leeds United. In the 2001–02 season, it even took first place in the English league for the first half of the season. These good performances allowed Leeds to participate in both the UEFA Cup and the Champions League. In the latter continental cup tournament, Lucas Radebe reached the semi-finals with Leeds United in 2001. It was lost to Valencia CF. The previous year had already reached the UEFA Cup semi-final, in which Leeds United lost to eventual winners Galatasaray SK.

From the season Lucas Radebe experienced the decline of Leeds United. That season started well and Leeds was third for a long time. In November, however, the club dropped to sixteenth place. Ultimately, Leeds United finished 15th that season, narrowly avoiding relegation. The poor performances were partly due to the departures of top players Olivier Dacourt, Rio Ferdinand, Robbie Fowler, Robbie Keane and Jonathan Woodgate. The fact that these players had to leave the club was due to a financial crisis that Leeds United had to contend with. The following season, 2003/2004, was disastrous. Lucas Radebe was relegated along with Leeds to the Football League Championship by finishing 19th in the Premier League.

In his last season with the club, 2004–05, Lucas Radebe failed to bring Leeds United an immediate promotion back to the Premier League. The club finished in a disappointing fourteenth place in the second highest league in England. Due to his advanced age and poor performance with Leeds, Radebe decided to end his career that season. He played a total of 200 league matches. However, he never managed to score.

On July 7, 1992, Lucas Radebe was allowed to play his first international match for South Africa. This was in a match against Cameroon. He won the 1996 African Cup of Nations with South Africa. It was the first time that South Africa won this cup. In the final, played in Johannesburg, Tunisia was beaten 2-0 by two goals from eventual top scorer of the tournament Mark Williams.

Radebe captained South Africa at both the 1998 FIFA World Cup, held in France and the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea. On 22 May 2003, he played his last international match for South Africa in a match against England. In total, Radebe played 70 international matches for his homeland. In it he scored twice.

After Radebe decided to retire from football, he played a farewell game on 2 May 2005 at Leeds United's home stadium, Elland Road. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Mario Melchiot, Clyde Wijnhard, Erik Bakke and Phil Masinga played in this match. In addition, he also played a farewell match in Durban, South Africa. The proceeds of both games plus extra money raised went to charity.

Radebe was going to help South Africa with the 2010 World Cup, which would be held in that country. In 2006, however, he withdrew because he was not offered a job and no longer expected it. He also no longer accepted a ceremonial position.

Graeme Friedman wrote a book about Radebe and his compatriot and football player Mark Fish. The book is titled "Madiba's Boys The Stories of Lucas Radebe and Mark Fish". The foreword was written by the former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela. Radebe and Mandela have a friendly relationship anyway. When Mandela once visited Leeds, he called Radebe his hero.

The British band Kaiser Chiefs says they named themselves after Lucas Radebe's old football club, Kaizer Chiefs. All members of the group are fans of Leeds United and have been able to enjoy Lucas Radebe's game there for eleven seasons. According to the members, Radebe had a great influence on them during their childhood.

In 2004 he was awarded 54th place on the list of the Greatest South African of all time. This was not only because of his good football, but also because of his commitment to charities. He is an ambassador for SOS Children's Villages.

Ordnance QF 25-pounder

The Ordnance QF 25-pounder, or the 25-pounder, was a British howitzer. It was used during the Second World War. It started being used right before the war started, and was better than previous British howitzers. The gun was better because it could fire at both long and short distances, and could be moved easily. It was the British Army's main artillery gun until the 1960s. Some groups used it for training up until the 1980s. The guns were produced slowly, but 12,000 were made by 1945.

The 25-pounder was made because the British Army wanted to replace the 18-pounder and 4.5-inch howitzer. These artillery guns had been in use for a long time, and were too old to be useful against new guns. The 25-pounder was made when the British Army made a weapon that combined the best features from both older weapons. The resulting idea was a gun that could fire howitzer rounds as fast as the 18-pounder. The shell for the 25-pounder was planned to weigh about 30 pounds, and be about 3.75 inches thick.

Making the 25-pounder before the Second World War was hard, because there was not enough money to fund building new guns. The British Army made the decision to change the barrels of the 18-pounders into new ones, and then change the rest of the gun later when money was available. This barrel fired shells that weighed about 25 pounds, and were 3.45 inches thick. It was placed on the carriage (a platform that could be rotated) of newer 18-pounders when it was fired. This made the gun put most of the recoil force into the ground, making it more stable when it fired. The platform gave the gun a smooth surface to rotate on when it was firing, which let soldiers operating it move the barrel faster.

1914 Salle Giandomenici international women's fencing competition

The 1914 Salle Giandomenici international women's fencing competition was the first women's international fencing competition in the Netherlands on 17 March 1914. It was the first international women's fencing competition in the Netherlands. The competition was organized the fencing academy of Giovanni Giandomenici, the Salle Giandomenici, located at the Keizersgracht in Amsterdam. Ten fencers from the Netherlands, England, and Belgium competed against each other. The British C. E. Martin Edmunds won the competition. Dutch Esther Bekkers-Lopes Cardozo of Salle Giandomenici took the second prize.

In the week before the competition it was reported that a total of fourteen women entered the competition. Five from the United Kingdom, two from Salle Verbrugge in Belgium, and seven Dutch fencers from Salle Giandomenici, in the Netherlands. A later article stated two other Dutch women who entered, but didn't compete.
The names in "italic" (Jean Colmer, A. M. Cunningham, Joyce Haworth, Lily Stoop) entered for the competition, but didn’t compete.

Felix Vigeveno and Max Zeldenrust both were president of the jury. The jury also included Verbrugge of Salle Verbrugge and Speyer.

The matches were in "competition-format" meaning that each fencer competed against each other fencer.

The early matches were held from 10 a.m. to 12 a.m. The final matches were from 3 p.m.

British champion C. E. Martin Edmunds, who won the first prize at the 1913 International Exposition fencing competition in Ghent, lost her first match against Rosamund Johnstone with 3-2. Edmunds won her three next matches against Goudeket, C. E. Taylor and M. Blom. Johnstone lost against the Dutch Esther Bekkers-Lopes Cardozo with 3-1, who had the advantage that she fenced left-handed. With an one hit difference, Bekkers-Lopes Cardozo also beated the Belgian Blom and the Dutch Mendels with 3-1. An important match was Bekkers-Lopes Cardozo against Edmunds. Edmunds with the advantage of being tall was able to beat Bekkers-Lopes Cardozo with her quickness and left-handedness. It was the only match Bekkers-Lopes Cardozo lost. The Dutch Meijerink lost her match against Edmunds but afterwards she won against Johnstone, Goudeket and Taylor.

The match that determined the final result was Edmunds against the Belgian J. De Deken. Bekkers-Lopes Cardozo would win overall if Edmunds lost. After a long match, Edmunds won with 3-2, and won the overall competition.

The English took advantage of their height and long arms. They fenced with great hesitation. The style was in contrast to the Belgians, who were very graceful and fenced with quick movements. The Dutch's style was between that of the English and Belgians.

Major growth in Maykop started after oil deposits were found nearby in 1910. Maykop was a town in Kuban Oblast at the time. 

In 1936, the Adyghe Autonomous Oblast was created with Maykop as the administrative center (capital city).

Maykop has been the capital of the Republic of Adygea since 1991.

The finding of large underground oil reserves in 1910 has made Maykop a major centre for oil extraction for the Soviet Union and, later, Russia. Other economically important sectors are food processing and the timber industry.

Ethnic groups in the city (2010 data):


Other ethnic groups include Chechens, Daghestanis and Tatars. There are ethnic tensions between the Muslim Adyghe and the Russians—with the two communities described as being "sharply divided".

Maykop is in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen climate classification: "Cfa").

Ci shrine

A Ci shrine, (祠), is a kind of religious building that originated in China. They are used for honoring people and ancestors.

They are a kind of Chinese temple and are different from Miao Shrines which honor deities instead of people and ancestors.

Ci shrines were often built by the public to worship public figures, sometimes living ones. In the Ming dynasty, the people of Teng County built a ci shrine to the life of Zhao Bangqing. Hero shrines were built to heroes who died for the country. The Chinese hero cult honors such heroes at Ci shrines.

Since ci and miao are similar, sometimes they are mixed together. Some ci shrines are dedicated to Confucian, Daoist, or Buddhist deities such as Wong Tai Sin Temple.

Barista

A coffee maker or barista is a person who prepares and delivers espresso-based drinks in a coffee shop. 

Although this profession is not an official profession, most coffee shops have an espresso machine to show. They use this word. Every year, the world barista competition is held to select their skills. This competition was established for the first time in Norway. After winning in their country, the baristas are selected and sent to the international competition.

Today, in many cafes, the barista prepares hot and cold drinks based on coffee or even other coffee. Baristas are usually dressed in a jacket, vest or apron to distinguish them from other baristas. A good barista should know exactly how much temperature and water pressure and how long to use to prepare an espresso shot, according to the type of coffee, the type of roast (roast) and the type of grinder.

Many baristas take great pride in their skills and spend years perfecting specific techniques to make great drinks. More experienced baristas are often tasked with training new employees. This training can range from making everyday drinks to creating specialty drinks to learning how to operate complex machinery.

Monotropism

Monotropism is a way that the autistic brain works, and can be thought to be a big part of what defines autism. A monotropic mind is one that focuses very strongly on only a few things. Dinah Murray and Wenn Lawson made the theory of monotropism, which was written about in the journal "Autism" with Mike Lesser in 2005.

Monotropic minds can focus on things very strongly, but this means that it's likely for a monotropic mind to have 'tunnel vision', which is when things that are not being focused on are not noticed at all. This stronger thinking can be a very positive feeling. However, monotropism means that moving from one task to another is harder. Starting and stopping activities is also hard, because a monotropic mind keeps getting pulled to focus on a small number of things.

This frog is in danger of dying out. This is because human beings change the places where it lives. Humans cut down trees for wood or to build farms or houses or make places for cows and other animals to eat grass. They are also dying from disease. They are also dying because new frogs from other places eat all the food.

2022 Western Mexico earthquake

On September 19, 2022, an earthquake of 7.6 to 7.7 degrees hit between the Mexican states of Michoacán and Colima. There were a total of 2 deaths and 12 injuries in different states of Mexico. According to the USGS the epicenter 37 kilometers from the town of Aquila, Coalcomán, Michoacán.

The place where the earthquake occurred is a seismically active area, where 3 plates meet, the North American plate to the Northeast, the Cocos plate and the Rivera plate to the South. Both the Cocos and Rivera plates are slowly sinking below the North American plate by 2 centimeters (0,79 inches) per year, relative to the rapid movement of the Cocos Plate with that of North America which moves 4 centimeters (1.8 in) per year.

Other great earthquakes have occurred in this same area, among them the 8.1 occurred in Jalisco in 1932, the 8.0 in 1995 in Colima or the 7.6 in 2003 between Colima and Jalisco, The strongest earthquake that affected Michoacán was the 8.0 earthquake in 1985.

The earthquake occurred due to thrust fault, between the Cocos plate and North America plate. This earthquake is not related to that of 1985, 1995 and 2003. According to the United States Geological Survey, earthquakes of this size typically rupture in an area measuring 90 km (56 mi) x 40 km (25 mi). Most of the co-seismic slip occurred directly below ground rather than offshore with a maximum displacement of 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in). 

The earthquake coincides with the 37th anniversary of the 1985 earthquake that killed 10,000 people and the 5th anniversary of the 2017 earthquake, an hour before the national drill of 19S had occurred in case of earthquakes.

In Manzanillo, Colima a Tsunami of a height of and in Zihuatanejo, Guerrero it was noted from a height of .

Currently 1,365 aftershocks have been reported including the 849 aftershocks of September 19 the largest being 5.2 the largest of 5.9 to a depth of occurred on September 20.

An aftershock of 6.8 was felt at 01:16 on September 22 to a depth of There were a total of 2 deaths, one from falling down the stairs and the other from a heart attack.

Western blot

The western blot is a scientific process. It is a test. Western blotting is also called immunoblotting. Scientists use Western blots to look at proteins. A Western blot can show how big a protein is. Sometimes a Western blot can show how much of the protein is there. Scientists studying proteins do Western blots more than any other test.

A Western blot is one kind of gel electrophoresis. That means the scientists make a gel in the shape of a rectangle. They put electrodes on two sides of the gel to make electricity. The electricity makes the proteins move from one side of the gel to the other.

One end of the gel has a positive electric charge. The other end has a negative electric charge. Most proteins have a negative charge. So the scientists put the proteins on the negative side of the gel. They put them in neat rows so they can see which sample is which. In one row, the scientist puts a mixture of proteins that they already know. This mixture is called a ladder.

Then the scientist turns on the electrodes to make a charge. This can be 60V. The proteins have a negative charge, so they move toward the positive side of the gel as if they are running a race. The scientist or technician waits for some time. This can be 90 minutes. Then the scientist turns off the electrodes so that the proteins stop moving. Then they look at the gel to see how far each sample moved. Small proteins move through gel faster than large proteins, so they move further. Proteins with big electric charges move faster than proteins with small electric charges. These are some of the ways a Western blot helps scientists tell proteins apart.

Next, the scientist moves the proteins from a gel onto a blotting membrane. This is why it is called a blot. The scientist puts the rectangular membrane on top of the rectangular gel, so the proteins stay in the same pattern.

Most proteins are clear or cloudy in color, so scientists have to make them easier to see. First, they block the proteins. That means they treat them so they will not bind to anything the scientist does not want. They can use milk to do this. Then they treat the proteins with a primary antibody. The primary antibody sticks to the protein. Then they treat them with a secondary antibody. The secondary antibody sticks to the primary antibody. The secondary antibody either glows or changes color. This way, the scientists can see how much protein is there on the membrane and where it went when it moved through the gel.

Sometimes scientists denature the proteins before the Western blot. Proteins are long chains of amino acids, like beads on a string. Most of the time, proteins are crumpled or squashed into balls or other shapes. A large protein in a tight ball will move faster than a large protein unfolded like a string. This can be confusing. Denaturing the protein makes it unfold so it is more like a string. This makes it easier to tell large proteins from small ones. Scientists put the chemical sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in the gel so the proteins stay unfolded. Otherwise, the proteins shrink into their tight ball shape again.

Most of the time, the scientist already thinks they know which proteins are in the sample. They choose a primary antibody that sticks to that protein. For example, if a doctor knows a patient is sick and thinks that patient has HIV, the doctor will take a cell sample from that patient. They will run a Western blot to look for proteins that HIV makes.

Scientists say Western blots are semi-quantitative. This means that the scientist can tell whether there is more or less protein but not exactly how much.

The first Western blot was in 1979. It got its name in 1981.

The Western blot is named after the person who invented the Southern blot, Edwin Southern. Southern blots find DNA. When scientists changed the Southern blot to find RNA, they called it a Northern blot. When scientists changed the Southern blot to find proteins, they called it a Western blot. When scientists changed the Southern blot to find lipids (fats), phosphates, and glycoconjugates, they called it an Eastern blot.

Democracy Index

The Democracy Index is an index compiled by The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). This is the research division of the Economist Group, a UK-based private company which publishes the weekly newspaper "The Economist". 

The index is a bit like the Human Development Index but more concerned with politics and freedoms. The index shows the state of democracy in 167 countries and territories, of which 166 are sovereign states and 164 are UN member states.
The index is based on 60 indicators grouped in five different categories, measuring democracy and civil liberties. In addition to a numeric score and a ranking, the index categorizes each country into one of four regime types: full democracies, flawed democracies, hybrid regimes, and authoritarian regimes. The first Democracy Index report was published in 2006. Reports were published every two years until 2010, and then annually.

Lysapsus limellum

The Uruguay harlequin frog ("Lysapsus limellum") is a frog. It lives in Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Brazil, and Argentina. Scientists have seen it as high as 800 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is 16.2–24.8 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 15.3-21.0 mm long. This frog can be light green, dark green-brown, or any color in between. Many of the frogs have stripes, but they do not all have the same kinds of stripes. The iris of the eye is gold in color.

This frog is much larger when it is a tadpole than when it is a frog. The tadpole can be 40 mm long with the tail (11 mm long not counting the tail). The tip of the tadpole's tail is black in color. Scientists think this may make animals that want to eat the tadpole attack its tail instead of its head.

Scientists found these frogs in places with much water and few trees. For example, river basins on savanna grasslands. This animal goes to places where plants float on top of the water instead of growing up from the bottom. The tadpoles swim in the middle of the water. They stay near plants that grow up from the bottom of the pond.

This frog lays eggs all year. The male frog sits on floating plants and sings for the female. The female lays 10-182 eggs at a time.

Fish and animals without bones eat the adult frog. Insects eat the tadpole.

Already three years before this first national competitions, women fencers of De Vos already competed internationally in London, United Kingdom during the 1911 England–Holland women's fencing competitions. The women of the Bredasche Schermvereeniging started fencing only recently, around half a year before this competition.

The fencers from The Hague were much better than the ladies from Breda. The first six of the seven prizes were won by the women from The Hague. 

T. van den Bergh won in a “beautiful way” the first prize. Beelaerts van Blokland and S. C. Scharroo Habbema, who lost both the same amount of matches, won the second and third prize. Their fencing was described as quick and elegant.

Republic of Western Armenia

The Republic of Western Armenia, is a so-called state claiming sovereignty over parts of the Armenian highlands including sections of Western Armenia as well as Artsakh, and Nakhichevan. Also, the self-declared country says it has its own presidency, government, parliament, constitution, national anthem and coat of arms. 

The individuals of the Republic of Western Armenia claim to be the legal successor of the Armenian state recognised by international law in 1920, and therefore internationally recognised.

The presence of Armenians in Anatolia has been documented since the sixth century BCE, about 1,500 years before the arrival of Turkmens under the Seljuk dynasty.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, historical Armenia was divided between the Ottomans taking the West and the Safavids taking the East. 

On the eve of World War I in 1914, around two million Armenians lived in Anatolia out of a total population of 15–17.5 million. According to the Armenian Patriarchate's estimates for 1913–1914, there were 2,925 Armenian towns and villages in the Ottoman Empire, of which 2,084 were in the Armenian highlands in the vilayets of Bitlis, Diyarbekir, Erzerum, Harput, and Van. Armenians were a minority in most places where they lived, alongside Turkish and Kurdish Muslim and Greek Orthodox Christian neighbors. According to the Patriarchate's figure, 215,131 Armenians lived in urban areas, especially Constantinople, Smyrna, and Eastern Thrace. Although most Ottoman Armenians were peasant farmers, they were overrepresented in commerce. As middleman minorities, despite the wealth of some Armenians, their overall political power was low, making them especially vulnerable. The ethnic cleansing of Armenians during the final years of the Ottoman Empire is widely considered a genocide, The Ottoman Empire massacred approximately 600,000–1,500,000 Armenians. The first wave of persecution was in the years 1894 to 1896, the second one culminating in the events of the Armenian genocide in 1915 and 1916.

On February 4, 2011 the beginning of the process of formation of the Government-in-Exile of Western Armenia was announced (now – the Government of the State of Western Armenia). In November 2013, through direct elections via Internet, the National Assembly (Parliament) of Western Armenia was formed, whose deputies at the first session of the Parliament on January 20, 2014, in Paris, elected the President of Western Armenia.

The "Western Armenia TV" newscaster introduced cities such as Bitlis, Muş, Van, Mardin, Iğdır, Adana, Trabzon and Rize as "Western Armenia" in his news bulletins. Artsakh and Nakhichevan is also claimed lands. The announcer also added that Western Armenia, which was declared an independent and sovereign state in 1920, is now occupied by Turkey. Sooner or later it will return to its true owners, the Armenians," he said. Erzurum, which the Armenians call "Karin", is claimed as the capital.
