Four characters from the original series returned: Doris Luke (Kathy Staff), Jill Harvey (n√©e Richardson), Jill's ex-husband Adam Chance (Tony Adams), and Jill's daughter Sarah-Jane Harvey (Joanne Farrell/Holly Newman). Initial reactions were favourable. However, changes in the story from the original puzzled fans and did not help ratings. Kathy Staff left in dismay at the amount of sex. She told ITV Teletext she felt it was no longer the family-friendly show she had originally been part of.

The story where original character Adam Chance murders ex-wife Jill Harvey three months into the new series' was unpopular with fans. Jane Rossington said she did not want to commit herself to another long run in the show, but warned Carlton it would be suicidal to kill Jill.
Episode 137 of the second revived series remains the only episode never to be shown in full on ITV. The lunchtime screening on Tuesday 11 September 2001 began at 14:10 BST. At the halfway commercial-break point however, the programme was interrupted to hand over to ITV News for then very sketchy details of the 9/11 attacks in New York City, USA. As the afternoon went on and the seriousness of the situation became clear, all ITV Network daytime programmes, starting with CITV transmissions at 15:15, were relegated to ITV2 to continue rolling news coverage. The semi-dropped episode was therefore transmitted in full on ITV2 at 17:30 BST. However, at the time, the channel was only available to a small number of viewers able to view the subscription-based ITV Digital, Telewest or NTL. As a result, the episode remains unseen by most of the programme's regular fanbase, including the entire Channel Islands who could not receive ITV Digital. A short re-cap of events in Episode 137 was screened before both the 14:10 and 17:05 showings of Episode 138 on 12 September 2001. The episode was included in the Omnibus edition that Sunday. This also only was shown on ITV2.

The series was reduced to four episodes a week from November 2001 until January 2002.

The series paused in August 2002. In January 2003, a changed series, under producer Yvon Grace, reappeared. It seemed to be a self-consciously camp parody, with Jane Asher playing a new central character - the glamorous and bitchy Angel Samson. The series also had appearances from Kate O'Mara, and people associated with light entertainment, such as Lionel Blair, Les Dennis and Tim Brooke-Taylor. The revived series also launched the careers of Freema Agyeman ("Doctor Who", ""), Luke Roberts ("Holby City" and "Mile High"), Lucy Pargeter, Shauna Shim and Jessica Fox.

Yvon Grace admitted she was aiming the new "Crossroads" towards the LGBT TV audience.
Plans were in place to bring Adam Chance back on a three-month contract in a last attempt to bring in more viewers; actor Tony Adams said that a down-on-his luck Adam would have been taken under Angel's wing as her personal assistant.

With ratings continuing to decline, the revived series was axed in March 2003. The final episode was shown on Friday 30 May 2003.

The 2003 series was criticised by fans who felt the series had moved away from the 1964-88 series and the 2001-02 series, as well as being "too gay".

The "Crossroads" theme tune was composed by Tony Hatch. In 2004 Hatch said:

A selection of cues were recorded, including "Meg's Theme" which eventually became the standard opening theme, "Kitty's Theme" which was phased out as action focussed on the motel, the closing theme which combined both "Meg's" and "Kitty's" themes, and a variety of background pieces.

A rerecording by The Tony Hatch Sound was issued as a single by Pye Records in 1965. A special arrangement of the theme by Paul McCartney and Wings, was also used from the late seventies, usually when an episode ended with a dramatic event. Central Independent Television's head of music Johnny Patrick rearranged the tune in 1985 for piano and synthesiser, upon the show's relaunch as "Crossroads Motel" by producer Philip Bowman. Following William Smethurst's arrival as producer in 1987, this recording was overdubbed with added synthesisers.

An entirely new theme aired in late 1987 when the series was relaunched as "Crossroads, Kings Oak", composed by Johnny Patrick, with Raf Ravenscroft and Max Early, with the CBSO. This later formed the basis of the single released by actress Shona Linsdey, "Goodbye", to commemorate the end of the show in 1988.

The 2001 revival brought back the original Tony Hatch theme, this time arranged and performed by TV theme composer Tony Flynn. Another version, in 2003, was arranged by Patrick Dineen and performed by the Liverpool Philharmonic.

The fictional Crossroads Motel was in a fictional village near Birmingham called Kings Oak. There are real suburbs in south-west Birmingham called Kings Heath, Kings Norton and Selly Oak). A number of real-life hotels doubled for location filming. The 1982 "Crossroads Special" said that the Longshoot Motel in Nuneaton) was used in designing the motel. It is likely that some scenes were filmed there.
In 1970, the series gained an O.B unit, giving it the freedom to do location shooting. Originally, Tanworth-in-Arden was used for King's Oak. Outside scenes were only occasionally used. From 1981 more location filming was used. Some early King's Oak location material was also filmed in Wolverhampton.

The most famous location, seen in the programme during the 1960s and 1970s, was not a motel. It was the Shropshire Agricultural Institution, now called North Shropshire College. In October 2019 two of the buildings used during filming, a teaching block and Bridden accommodation block were demolished.

It has been suggested that "Crossroads" was filmed at a 1960s motel on Stratford Road in Alcester Warwickshire. It was called CherryTrees. The buildings were demolished in 2001. A nearby petrol station, since closed, was used in the early 1980s to film a couple of outdoor scenes of the Crossroads garage.

In 1982, the fictional motel was destroyed by fire. The revamped motel was filmed at the Golden Valley Hotel (now Jurys Inn) in Cheltenham.

From 1985 filming moved to the Penns Hall Hotel (now Ramada Jarvis Birmingham) in Sutton Coldfield. The changed appearance was explained as being due to rebuilding. New studio sets were also introduced.

Other locations included the canal (including Gas Street Basin) behind the studios in Birmingham. in the story this was the King's Oak Canal, on which Vera had a barge. The Chateau Impney Hotel, called the Droitwich Hotel in the story, was also used. In 1983, St Laurence's Church in Alvechurch was the setting for Jill and Adam Chance's wedding. Hagley Hall was used for the wedding reception. Helios Health Club in Brierley Hill was used as the location for the Motel Health Club. It was filmed on Mondays when the health club was closed.

In 1985, "Crossroads" gained its first set of full length opening titles, filmed around Sutton Coldfield, Tanworth-in-Arden and in Birmingham city centre.

The revived "Crossroads" from 2001 was still set in the West Midlands. Exterior shots were filmed at locations in and around Nottingham, such as Bingham and Redmile.

The original series was recorded at ATV's/Central's Broad Street studios in Birmingham, while the revived series was filmed at Carlton Studios in Nottingham.

Despite the popularity of "Crossroads" with the viewing public, the show was often criticised by TV reviewers and ridiculed by British comedians. Television historian Hilary Kingsley stated that "Crossroads" never failed "to provide its critics with ammunition. Some of the acting would have disgraced the humblest of village halls; many of the plots were so farcical they could have been written in a bad dream, and much of the dialogue was pathetic." "The Guinness Book of Classic British TV" noted that ""Crossroads" was the series that no-one seemed to love. Yet at its peak, it was watched by more viewers than any other soap except "Coronation Street"."

The revived series also received mixed reviews from critics.

Spoof soap opera "Acorn Antiques", created by comedian Victoria Wood as part of "Victoria Wood As Seen On TV", is a deliberate parody of "Crossroads". The final episode of "As Seen on TV" in 1987 features a hoax documentary, 'The Making of Acorn Antiques', in which the actress playing Mrs Overall (Julie Walters) - a character based on "Crossroads" characters Amy Turtle and Mavis Hooper - is revealed as a rather grand character who considers herself a huge star. This portrayal, plus a later pretend news item in which it is revealed she has been sacked from the show, both suggest the actress character (later given the name Bo Beaumont in the musical based on the sketches) is based on Noele Gordon, with Bo making her 'goodbye' appearance to the press in headscarf and large sunglasses and making a dramatic speech, just as Gordon did.

In 2005, Network DVD issued four volumes of the series on DVD (UK Region 2). Each volume has 12 of the original ATV episodes. The first volume includes Meg's 1975 wedding, the highest rated episode.

In February 2007, "Crossroads Volume 3" was released. There are two versions of the DVD, one being a special limited edition, which contains an extra third disc - featuring recently found episodes from 1976.

In September 2007, "Crossroads Volume 4" was released.

In 2008, Network DVD started to release all the surviving episodes in transmission order through its website. The first set of 16 episodes was released in January 2008 and contained some episodes not available on earlier DVD releases.
There are 1,700 episodes of "Crossroads" in existence; most of these are from Central Television's run of the show from 1982 to 1988.

A black and white "Crossroads Archive Volume 1.1" has also been released, containing the episode from April 1965, along with 2 further episodes, numbered 1884 and 1886 from March 1973. These were both originally made in colour but now survive only as black and white telerecordings.

On 2 November 2009, to coincide with the show's 45th anniversary, Network DVD re-released 21 volumes in a 41-disc box-set. Susan Hanson, who played Diane Hunter, appeared on "The Alan Titchmarsh Show" and "Loose Women" on 6 and 13 November 2009 respectively, to promote the box-set.

From 1996 until 2001, episodes of the original series were repeated on UKTV channel "UK Gold".

From February to September 2015, the original series aired on Big Centre TV on Freeview channel 8 in the Midlands or available online live at 9.00pm each evening Monday to Saturday, which could also be watched free on their catchup service.

"Crossroads" was adapted into a weekly comic strip in 1972 by Dutch comics artist Alfred Mazure, published in TVTimes.

Realism theory

Realism theory is a way of thinking about politics and world history, that focuses on being realistic. It is one of the main styles of international relations theory. It gives the theoretic background to Realpolitik statesmanship of early modern Europe. According to Realism, world politics is always and necessarily a field of conflict among actors who want power. The theories of realism are contrasted by the cooperative ideals of liberalism.

Depending on what they see as the cause of the conflict between states, realists can be divided into three classes: Classical realists believe it follows from human nature; neorealists attribute it to the dynamics of the anarchic state system; neoclassical realists believe it results from both, in combination with domestic politics. Neorealists are also divided between defensive and offensive realism. Realists trace the history of their ideas back through classical antiquity, beginning with Thucydides.

Jonathan Haslam defines realism as "a spectrum of ideas." Its theories revolve around four main rules:


Realism is often associated with Realpolitik, as both deal with the pursuit, possession, and application of power. Realpolitik, however, is an older prescriptive guideline limited to policy-making, while realism is a wider theoretical and methodological paradigm to describe, explain, and predict events in international relations. As an academic pursuit, realism is not tied to ideology; it does not favor any particular moral philosophy, nor does it consider ideology to be a major factor in the behavior of nations. Priorities of realists have been described as Machiavellian, single-mindedly seeking the power of one's own nation over others.

Donetsk People's Republic

The Donetsk People‚Äôs Republic was a partially recognised country in the Donbas region of Ukraine. It is now a region in Russia. 

When the War in Donbas started in 2014, a few hundred pro-Russian separatists declared that the Donetsk Oblast was an independent country. 

Donetsk Oblast is all to the east of Ukraine, at the border with Russia. In both parts, there are many ethnic Russians. Russia aided the start of these non-recognised states. 

In 2014, Russia invaded and took Crimea from Ukraine, while armed separatists captured government buildings in the Donetsk Oblast. They declared that the Donetsk Oblast was an independent country named the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). Approximately at the same time, other people started Luhansk People's Republic in Luhansk Oblast. This sparked the war in Donbas, part of the wider Russo-Ukrainian War. 

In early 2022, Russia officially recognised the DPR as a country. A few days later, Russia invaded Ukraine. In late 2022, the Donetsk People's Republic, alongside three other separatist oblasts, became a republic of Russia. However, the international community agrees that Donetsk legally belongs to Ukraine and that the annexation of Donetsk was illegal.

The Donetsk People's Republic led by the Head of the DPR and the Chairman of the Government. The Republic is ruled by the People's Council, which has 100 members. It is a dictatorship.

The government completely changed the education system. They removed the Ukrainian curriculum and replaced it with the Russian one. They also decreased lessons teaching the Ukrainian language.

The international community generally agrees that the Donetsk People's Republic belongs to Ukraine and that its independence was done illegally. In 2022, the only countries to recognise the DPR as an independent country were Russia, Syria and North Korea.

In late 2022, the DPR and three other separatist regions of Ukraine became republics of Russia. Many countries also agree that this was illegal.

Public

In communication science and public relations, "public" mostly means people. The meaning of this is different than other ideas, such as gatherings in social life to talk about people (public sphere). The meaning of this is also talked about in the learning of government (political science), the learning of how humans think (psychology), and the learning of giving things to people (marketing). This word's meaning is very hard to make, as people think that public has different meanings.

The word "public" comes from the Latin "publicus", or "of the people".

In the learning of government (politics), "public" means a group of people who are related to government (leader group). In psychology and public relations, public has even more different meanings.

In the year of 1929, John Dewey had the meaning of "public" as a group of people who answer the same problem. This means that this meaning is about problems (situational). This definition of "public" with "problem" is so misunderstood that people made a whole new learning place, called as "the idea of the public being about problems" (situational theory of publics) created by James E Gruning, who was so into "the idea of the public being about problems‚Äù that he also thought of ‚Äúthe idea of the public "not" being about problems", and so made sets that put the ideas of the meaning of public in order. This includes "the idea of a public without a problem" (nonpublics), "the idea of public with a problem" (latent publics), and "the idea of public who know they have a problem" (active publics).

In this meaning, the meaning of ‚Äúpublic‚Äù is not someone who likes business (stakeholder) or a system of getting and giving things for money (market). This meaning of "public" here is that it is a part of a group of multiple people who like business (stakeholder) who all need to solve a problem. This is not a market because it does not have any money moving system (exchange system), and that a "public" is created by itself (self-forming) and puts itself in order by itself (self-organizing). The people who are in public relations do things for the "public". People who are needed to make a group's dreams come true are named as "target publics", and people that help the target publics are named as "influentials". Influentials are important, because they give answers to the target public's problems. The "target publics" are also important, because their answers to the government problems (like electoral votes) are very important.

The public also has rules of being in the public ("social norms"), that play a major role in how information is moved.

Public relations theory shows that the meaning of publics is situational, according to John Dewey and James E. Gruning, and is simply a group of people. According to Gabriel M. Vasquez, a public has people that all know about their common problem and all try to solve that problem (‚Äúhomo narrans‚Äù [Latin for "storytelling human"]), and create a list of problems to be solved (agenda-building). For example, Schools are commonly talked about for their agenda-building, on whether they should teach about religion or not (secular). Some people think publics are about the government (political) and last forever.

But, other people think that the meaning of public is non-situational. Kirk Hallahan, professor at Colorado State University, thinks that the meaning of public is about another organization, and has public as that it is people who are about (relate) to an organization, who show different amounts of activity‚Äîpassivity (getting information without giving it), and who might (or might not) talk with others about their relationship with the group.

Social publics are people who like the same ideas or hobbies.

Networked publics are social publics who are organized by the new technology. Because of this, networked publics are the result of technologies that connect people (networked technologies, like social media), and the whole result from a combination of the people in the networked public, their technologies, and their ideas.

The situational theory of publics, is about the idea that publics can be used and organized by how much they know (are aware of) their common problem, and how much action the group has taken to resolve that problem. This theory shows when people communicate ideas and when the ideas are about the people who are important in solving the common problem. This theory is almost the same as John Dewey's theory of publics and Blumer's theory of publics.

The five key concepts in this theory are:


This theory comes from James E. Grunig's writing, "The Role of Information in Economic Decision Making" in 1966. This writing was the beginning of the situational theory of publics, as it had the first key idea, problem recognition, in the writing. Then, when he wrote about the decisions of people who own land in Columbia to become a professor, he also wrote about the second key idea, constraint recognition. He then added Herbert Krugman's idea of the third key idea, level of involvement, to explain the difference between the fourth and fifth key ideas, information seeking and information processing. After that, he wrote a book in 1984 which was named "Managing Public Relations", which further made the situational theory of publics make more sense, based on John Dewey's book, which was named "The Public and Its Problems".

People who use the theory created equations which used the theory to organize the different types of publics, and the most real effects of communication for each public. Because these math rules were created, it made the theory more understandable and became used in a more common way in learning the theory (academic studies) and in some professional learning. This theory is like the learning of the actions of people buy things (consumer behavior), health communication, how media works (media exposure), and the communication of government related ideas (political communication), which are common in other parts of the learning of communication (communication research). But, this theory has more common key ideas and a more developed system of learning and analysis because of the equations. Because of this, it can become more common (popular) and include other smaller less common theories inside it (subsume).

Even though the theory is well developed, it develops even more common. The theory has been used to show why people join groups who really want things to happen (activist groups), to organize the external (real, actual) and internal (perceived) parts (dimensions) of problem recognition, and to learn whether information that is used in information processing (processed information) can create publics. Also, some more research was done on the internal and external dimensions of problem recognition, constraint recognition, and level of involvement (Grunig & Hon, 1988; Grunig, 1997). The research is about whether the ideas are internal or external. The research shows that if the concepts are internal, they can be changed by communication, and that if they are external, then the holdable things that are around the person need to be changed in order for the person's concept of the variables to change (Grunig, 1997, p.¬†25). But, there is a small amount of research on the internal and external dimensions of the three key concepts, so there can be more studies on these concepts (Grunig, 1997). Then, in 2011, Jeong-Nam Kim and Grunig extended the theory to the situational theory of problem solving.

Sans-culottes

The sans-culottes (, which means "without breeches") were the lower classes in late 18th century France. Lots of sans-culottes became radical supporters and fighters for the French Revolution. This was because of their poor quality of life under the "Ancien R√©gime". The word sans-culotte, which is the opposite of aristocrat, was said for the first time on 28 February 1791 by officer Jean-Bernard Gauthier de Murnan in a bad way. He was talking about a "sans-culottes army" - an army of peasants. The word became popular during the demonstrations of June 1792. 

The name, though it is about clothing, is actually a way to talk about the sans-culottes' social status. "Culottes" were the fashionable silk knee-breeches of the 18th-century nobility and bourgeoisie. The working class "sans-culottes" wore "pantaloons", or trousers, instead. The "sans-culottes", most of them urban labourers, were the force behind the French Revolution. The other members of the revolution thought that they were "radicals" because they wanted a direct democracy. This would mean that the people would vote on laws themselves, and that there would be no legislature. Though they had bad clothes and equipment, and got little or no support from the rich, they were most of the Revolutionary army and executed many people during the early years of the French Revolutionary Wars.

It is about topics such as Americans' attitudes towards fantasy fiction, the strengths and weaknesses of science fiction, and how children's literature is special. She also discusses the background of her major works such as "A Wizard of Earthsea" and "The Left Hand of Darkness". However, some critics complained that "The Language of the Night" has both more important and less important writing. The collection was nominated for a Hugo for Best Related Non-Fiction Book category in 1980. The title comes from Le Guin's description of fantasy literature. She said, "We like to think we live in daylight, but half the world is always dark; and fantasy, like poetry, speaks the language of the night."

"Frozen II" had its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on November 50, 2019. It was released in the US by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures on November 22, 2019.

The movie received positive reviews from critics who liked its animation, visuals, writing, music, and vocals. It has grossed $1.406 billion worldwide. It had the highest all-time worldwide opening for an animated movie. The movie is the second highest-grossing animated movie yet made and the third highest-grossing movie of 2019, as well as the 10th highest-grossing movie of all time.

The character Kristoff is meant to be S√°mi, a group of indigenous people who live in northern Europe and Asia. Some people who saw the first "Frozen" complained that Kristoff was not a good way to show S√°mi because he is light-skinned and blond. This is called whitewashing. Although some S√°mi look like Kristoff, most have darker skin and hair. When making Frozen II, Disney signed a contract with S√°mi leaders and hired S√°mi experts to make sure the fictional S√°mi in the movie, the Northuldra, would be shown respectfully.

Everyday (video)

Noah Takes a Photo of Himself Every Day for 6 Years (as it is called on YouTube), or Everyday (as it is called on the title card), is a viral video made by Noah Kalina, a photographer from New York. Thousands of pictures of himself he took over six years are shown fast in time order.

Noah started to take a photo of himself every day on January 11, 2000, when he was 19 years old. The video shows the photos in time order, six per second, with original music played on piano by his ex-girlfriend Carly Comando. In each photo, his face is in the center of the frame, and shows no emotion. He uploaded the video to Vimeo on August 8, 2006, and on YouTube on August 27, 2006. "Everyday" was shown on an episode of VH1's "Web Junk 20", and on commercials for Time Warner Cable's Roadrunner service. In a "New York Times" article, it was said William A. Ewing, director of the Mus√©e de l'√âlys√©e, said "Noah‚Äôs video represents a phenomenal amplification not just in what he produced and how he did it, but how many people the piece touched in such a short period of time. There is nothing comparable in the history of photography." , "Everyday" had more than 26.4 million views on YouTube.

Noah originally wanted "Everyday" to be a photo project, but wanted to make a film instead after seeing a video by Ahree Lee, which did the same thing, but for three years. He put his photographs into a video and released it on YouTube.

In December 2006, because "Everyday" was so popular, VH1 asked Noah to take photographs of himself in the same pose as he did in "Everyday", but with some celebrities, including Paris Hilton, Lance Bass, David Hasselhoff, Jenna Jameson, will.i.am, Flavor Flav, lonelygirl15 and "Weird Al" Yankovic. The photographs were taken backstage at the VH1 Big in '06 Awards. In the ceremony, which was shown on television, several of the pictures were shown before and after commercial breaks. Kalina also posted the photographs on Flickr.

On July 16, 2012, Noah announced an longer version of the video, called "Noah takes a photo of himself every day for 12.5 years", on his website. The video, which came out on YouTube on September 4, 2012, shows 12 years and 5 months of his photographs of himself over 7 minutes and 34 seconds (10 frames per second, or 1 month every 3 seconds).

On January 14, 2020, Noah released "Noah takes a photo of himself every day for 20 years" on YouTube. This video shows 20 years of his photographs of himself over 8 minutes and 17 seconds (15 frames per second, or 1 month every 2 seconds).

Noah, who was born on July 4, 1980, lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York. He grew up in Centerport, New York, and went to Harborfields High School. He graduated from the School of Visual Arts.

"The Simpsons" episode "Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind" includes a parody of the video, in which all 39 years of Homer Simpson's life are shown in the same way.

"Family Guy" also has a parody of the video, in which Peter Griffin takes a picture of himself every day for one year in the same way, except the song "Hey There Delilah" by the Plain White T's is used.

The National Basketball Association used the song in "Where Amazing Happens", an advertising campaign that happened from 2007 to 2008.

COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic, also called the coronavirus pandemic, is a world-wide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The disease was first found in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019. On 31 December, Chinese health authorities told the World Health Organization (WHO)about a group of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020. The virus is believed to have come from an animal source, possibly a bat, and it is thought to have been transmitted to humans at a live meat market in Wuhan where live animals were being sold. The virus quickly spread to other parts of the world by airplanes and ships, because of its highly infectious nature and ease of transmission. The World Health Organization (WHO) called it a pandemic (global disease) on 11 March 2020.The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses gave the virus its name. As of , about cases of COVID-19 have been reported, and about people have died of COVID-19.

The virus mostly spreads when people are close to each other, which is why social distancing is used. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and trouble breathing. The illness can worsen with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. As of January 2021, a number of vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, but only a few have been found safe to use. The first vaccine to be approved was created by Pfizer and BioNTech, followed by the Oxford / AstraZeneca vaccine. Vaccine distribution was started in many countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. The United Kingdom was the first western country to begin to give out a COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine was given out to all people in the country for free. No antiviral medicine for COVID-19 is available. Doctors usually give patients supportive therapy instead such as giving fluids, food, oxygen, pain relief and other treatments designed to help patients deal with the symptoms. People can avoid spreading the virus by regularly washing their hands, covering their mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, staying away from crowds, wearing medical or cloth face coverings, and being alone for people who think they are infected, also known as quarantining.

The outbreak might be from a coronavirus that usually lives in bats. This then likely infected another animal, possibly a pangolin. It then changed inside that other animal until it could infect humans. It possibly originated at a wet market (a live food animal market), Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. A 55-year-old person from Hubei province was the first human to contract the virus on November 17, 2019. A 61-year-old man who was a regular customer at the market was the first person to die from the virus on January 11, 2020. The exact origin of the virus is still unknown since the market in Wuhan sold a variety of live wild animals in cages. Chinese tourists have spread the virus by traveling to other countries and made it a worldwide pandemic.

Racism and xenophobia against Chinese people and Asians increased during the pandemic.

In November 2020, two companies, Pfizer and Moderna, said they had finished making COVID-19 vaccines. Two mRNA vaccines, one by Pfizer and one by Moderna, have been tested. Both were over 90% effective. Countries began planning to give the vaccine to many people.

The United States has had the most deaths from the virus. Over 1 million Americans have died from the virus.

In March 2020, the companies belonging to Sistema allocated about 1 billion rubles for the fight against coronavirus, the bulk of which was spent on the development of tests to detect infection, as well as on the production of protective equipment and antiseptics.

In May 2023 the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.

On 31 December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.

On 9 June 2020, a Harvard University study suggested that COVID-19 may have been spreading in China as early as August 2019, based on hospital car park usage and web search trends.

Cases means the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and have tested positive. These cases are according to Johns Hopkins University.

Almost all people who get COVID-19 recover. For those who do not, the time between the start of symptoms and death usually ranges from6 to 41 days, but most of the time about 14 days. This data are recorded by the WHO.

According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs. People usually cough and have difficulty breathing. They often also have a fever, chills, headache, pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things, which can often be confused with the flu virus.

According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea, but this is rare. They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients vomited, about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs.

Since there is no exact cure for Covid-19, treatment has focused on treating the symptoms of the disease such as giving oxygen and using machines to aid breathing, giving pain killers to relieve pain, supportive treatment such as giving fluids, food and drugs to combat other symptoms and diseases that affect the person at the same time. Doctors have tried different medicines to see if they help in treatment such as colchicine, systemic corticosteroids (particularly dexamethasone), interleukin-6 receptor antagonists (such as tocilizumab), and Janus kinase inhibitors (such as baricitinib) have been seen to reduce mortality and have other benefits in patients with severe covid-19, such as reducing the severity of the disease and reducing the length of hospital stay.

In February 2020, the WHO announced a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. It replaced the name "2019-nCoV." "Covi" is for "coronavirus," "D" for "disease," and "19" for the year 2019 ‚Äì the year it was first detected. They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it because people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal. For example, it did not use the word "Wuhan." They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud.

According to an article in Market Watch dated on February 27, 2020, the overall case mortality rate in China was 2.3%. However, these results might be severely different between different age groups and between men and women. People over the age of 70 experienced a rate of mortality 4-5 times that of the average. Men were more likely to die than women (2.8% versus 1.7% for women) possibly due to lifestyle, such as it being more possible in men to drink and smoke, making the risk of having a respiratory illness more possible, and thus more vulnerable. These numbers were the conclusion of a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention using 72,314 COVID-19 cases in mainland China as of Feb. 11. At that point this was the largest sample of cases for such a study.

On March 5, 2020, the WHO released the case fatality rate.

COVID-19 did not affect everyone in each country the same way. As of May 2020, APM Research Lab said the death rate among black Americans was 2.4 times as high as for white Americans and 2.2 times as high as for Latino and Asian Americans. In July 2020, "The New York Times" printed data from the Centers for Disease Control showing that black and Latino Americans were three times as likely to become sick and twice as likely to die as white Americans. This was not only in large cities but also in rural areas. This was not only for old people but for people in all age groups. Native Americans were also more likely than whites to become sick and die. Asian Americans were 1.3 times as likely as whites to become sick.

Camara Jones, an epidemiologist who once worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this was socioeconomic and not because of any natural difference in black and white people's bodies. In the United States, black citizens are more likely to work jobs where they serve the public directly and to ride on public transport rather than take their own cars to work. This makes them more likely to be infected than people who work in private offices or from home. Sharrelle Barber, an epidemiologist and biostatistician from Drexel University, also said black Americans can live in crowded neighborhoods where social distancing is harder to do and healthy food harder to find. Both Barber and Jones blamed the long history of racism in the United States for these things. Three senators, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren said the federal government should start recording the race of COVID-19 patients so scientists could study this problem.

In June, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) told the public that people using the United States' government's Medicare health program had different results depending on race. Four times as many black Medicare patients went to hospitals for COVID-19 than white Medicare patients. There were twice as many hospitalized Hispanic patients than white patients. There were three hospitalized Asian patients for every two hospitalized white patients. The head of CMS, Seema Verma, said this was mostly because of socioeconomic status.

In the United Kingdom, twice as many black COVID-19 patients died as white COVID-19 patients. Other non-white people, like people from India and Bangladesh, were also more likely to die of COVID-19 than whites. Britain's Office of National Statistics said that the differences in money and education explained some of this difference but not all of it. They also said they did not know whether non-white patients caught COVID-19 more often or whether they caught more severe cases. Only female Chinese Britons were less likely to die of COVID-19 than white Britons.

Native Americans in the United States have shown more deaths from COVID-19 than the rest of the U.S. As of May, the Navajo Nation had 88 deaths and 2,757 cases, and the money they had been promised by the government arrived several weeks late. Only 30% of the people in the Navajo Nation have pipes with running water, which made it difficult for people to wash their hands.

Scientists from Chapman University made a plan to protect the Tsimane people in Bolivia from COVID-19 and said this plan would also work for other indigenous peoples living on their own land. The scientists said that many indigenous peoples have problems that make COVID-19 more dangerous for them, like poverty, less clean water, and other lung diseases. Hospitals may be a long distance away, and racism can affect the way doctors and nurses react. But they also sometimes have things that help, like traditions of making decisions together and the ability to grow food nearby. The scientists found people who spoke the Tsimane language as a first language and made teams to go to Tsimane towns to warn them about COVID-19. They also used radio stations. They said the best plan was for whole communities to decide to isolate. They found this worked well because the Tsimane already usually made their big decisions together as a community in special meetings and already had a tradition of quarantining new mothers. The Chapman scientists said their plan would also work for other indigenous peoples who also make decisions together, like the Tsimane.

In May 2020, police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota killed an unarmed black man called George Floyd while they were arresting him. There were weeks of protests all over the world against police brutality and racism. Experts said they were worried protesters and police could spread SARS-CoV-2 to each other. Other experts said some of the reasons that the protests were so big was because non-white people were being killed by COVID-19 more than white people were, because poor leadership in the COVID-19 crisis reminded them of poor leadership about racism, and because the lockdowns shut down workplaces and other things. This meant people had more time to protest.
African Americans are more likely to catch the virus compared to their white counterparts in the United States, and are also more likely to die from it. 50,000 African Americans died of COVID-19 in 2020. African Americans are the least likely to get vaccinated against the disease.

Latinos have been at a higher risk of hospitalization or death from COVID-19 in the United States. There are many reasons why Latinos have a higher risk of getting very sick or going to the hospital because of COVID-19. One reason is that they often have health problems like diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. They are also more likely to have jobs where they have to be around other people, like in healthcare, grocery stores, and farming. Many Latinos live in crowded places with many people, like big families or busy neighborhoods. This makes it hard to stay far away from others and can make the virus spread more easily. Some Latinos might not speak English well, which can make it hard to get healthcare or understand how to stay healthy. Finally, many Latinos don't have health insurance or don't have enough of it. All of these things are connected and can make it more likely for Latinos to get very sick from COVID-19.

In early 2020, some people began to think that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been made on purpose in a laboratory and either released by accident or on purpose like a weapon. Some Iranians thought the Americans might have made it. Chinese state media said COVID-19 came from the United States to China and not the other way around. Some Americans thought the Chinese might have made it. Some Britons thought it might have been created by accident by 5G cell phone networks.

On March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in "Nature Medicine" showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory. They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. Within a few weeks, it became one of the most cited scientific papers in history, meaning that other scientists were reading and using it.

There were also several conspiracy theories circulating about Bill Gates and his alleged involvement with the COVID-19 pandemic. Theories wrongfully linking Gates to the coronavirus were mentioned 1.2 million times on television or social media between February and April of 2020. One of the most prominent ones was that Bill Gates somehow created or engineered the virus as part of a plan to depopulate the world. There is no evidence to support this claim, and it has been debunked by numerous experts in the field and fact checking organizations including the the National Institutes of Health and Reuters. Some conspiracy theorists allege that Bill Gates is using the pandemic to profit from the development and distribution of vaccines and other medical treatments. While Gates has been heavily involved in funding research on vaccines and treatments for COVID-19, he has not personally profited from this work. In fact, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has donated over $2 billion to COVID-19 efforts since the start of the pandemic. 

One of the impacts of these conspiracy theories is that they have generated fear and suspicion towards COVID-19 vaccines. Bill Gates commented on the impact of these theories, saying: "During the pandemic, there were tens of millions of messages that I intentionally caused it, or I'm tracking people. It's true I'm involved with vaccines, but I'm involved with vaccines to save lives."

On December 31, 2019, China alerted WHO to several cases of unusual pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei province.

On January 20, 2020, Chinese premier Li Keqiang called for efforts to stop and control the pneumonia epidemic caused by a novel coronavirus. As of February 5, 2020, 24,588 cases have been confirmed, including in every province-level division of China. A larger number of people may have been infected, but not detected (especially mild cases). The first local transmission of the virus outside China occurred in Vietnam between family members, while the first local transmission not involving family occurred in Germany, on January 22, when a German man contracted the disease from a Chinese business visitor at a meeting. , 493 deaths have been attributed to the virus since the first confirmed death on January 9, with 990 recoveries. The first death outside China was reported in the Philippines, in a 44-year-old Chinese male on February 1. but another source reported:
"The first cases of COVID-19 outside of China were identified on January 13 in Thailand and on January 16 in Japan".

There has been testing which have showed over 6000 confirmed cases in China, some of whom are healthcare workers.

Confirmed cases have also been reported in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong, the United States (Everett, Washington and Chicago), Singapore, Vietnam, France and Nepal.

The World Health Organization declared that this is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern since January 30, 2020.

Bloomberg News and other business publications have reported several plant closures, travel restrictions, and imposed quarantines as a result of this outbreak. Many small businesses, even big ones, have gone bankrupt because of the pandemic.

As of February 10, 2020 there have been 40,235 confirmed cases reported of people infected by the virus in China. Also reported were 909 deaths, and 319 cases in 24 other countries, including one death, according to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

On November 14, 2020, there were 53,853,718 global COVID-19 cases and 1,311,524 deaths with cases in 217 countries and territories.












The pandemic made it more difficult for millions of people all over the world to get enough food. People lost their jobs, so they did not have money to buy food. Farms were shut down, so there was less food made. Processing plants and food factories were shut down, so less food was made ready for people to eat.

In April, Arif Husain of the United Nations' World Food Program said that 130 million more people could go hungry, in addition to the 135 million who were already hungry before the pandemic began. He said that poorer countries would be more affected than rich countries because the way they move raw food from farms to cities and other places where people live is less organized and relies more on human beings than on automatic systems.

This hunger crisis is different from crises in other years because it happened to the whole world at the same time. That meant that people working in other countries could not help by sending money home.

All over the world, children who ate meals at school had less access to food when the schools were shut down.

Scientists from the University of Michigan said the pandemic was making it harder for people to find food. In a study published in May, they said one in seven Americans over age 50 said they had trouble getting enough food before the pandemic, and it got worse when senior centers that provided meals were closed. Federal and state governments started programs to bring food to older people and children. There were also more food donation drives in towns.

In the United States, nursing homes had some of the highest rates of infection and death,

40% of all COVID-19 deaths in the country. Nursing homes are group homes for old people who need medical care, for disabled people who need medical care, and for people recovering from severe sickness or injury, like stroke patients.

Many people who live in nursing homes pay through the government program Medicaid, which pays less than Medicare or regular insurance companies. In June, many American nursing homes were caught throwing their regular patients out so they could make room for COVID-19 patients who could pay them more. Because nursing homes had stopped allowing visitors, it took longer for them to get caught. United States law requires nursing homes to warn patients 30 days before kicking them out, but the nursing homes did not do this.

Some of the nursing homes took the COVID-19 patients because state governments asked them to and they say they sent their elderly residents away because they were worried they would catch COVID-19 from the sick patients.

Because so many governments told people to stay at home, there was less air pollution than usual for that time of year. Pollution in New York fell by 50% and the use of coal in China fell by 40%. The European Space Agency showed pictures taken from a satellite of China's pollution disappearing during quarantine and coming back when everyone went back to work.

The pandemic and shutdowns made people use less electricity. In the United States, people got less of their electricity from coal power but kept using gas and renewable power like wind and solar power. This was because coal plants are more expensive to run, so power companies used them less.

Pollution from before the pandemic also affected what happened after people became sick. Scientists saw that more people died from COVID-19 in places with large amounts of air pollution. One team of scientists from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg looked at air pollution information from satellites and statistics on COVID-19 deaths in Italy, France, Germany and Spain and saw that places with large amounts of nitrogen dioxide pollution had more people die from COVID-19. Nitrogen dioxide can damage the lungs.

The shutdowns and social distancing also affected animals. Human beings started staying at home about the same time in the spring when sea turtles like to come on land to lay their eggs. Turtle scientists in the United States and Thailand both reported more nests than usual on seashores in Florida and Phuket. They say it is because people are not coming to the beach or bringing their dogs to the beach and because there are fewer boats in the water nearby. Scientists also say they see more dugong and dolphins. With fewer cars driving down roads, salamanders, frogs, and other amphibians were able to cross them for their spring migration. According to citizen scientists from Big Night Maine, a group that watches amphibians, four amphibians made it across the roads alive for every one amphibian killed by cars. Most years, it is only two to one.

Not all ocean mammals did well. According to marine biologists in Florida, manatee deaths in April and May were 20% higher than in 2019. They say this was because many people decided to go boating because other things to do were closed.

Researchers from the San Diego Zoo Global had the idea for a system that people could use to find dangerous germs before they become pandemics or even before they jump from other animals to humans. They said it was important to watch the wildlife trade, like in the Wuhan wet market. The scientists said that over the past eleven years it has gotten easier and easier to sequence viral genomes, and it does not have to be done by a large lab or by a government any more. The scientists said it would be better to spread the work out among more people.



Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus which causes the disease COVID-19. It used to be known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO).

The virus started the 2019‚Äì20 coronavirus outbreak. The first suspected cases were reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019.
Many early cases of this new coronavirus were linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan, China. The virus may have come from infected animals. It is not certain that this place was the source of the pandemic.

The genetic material of this virus showed many similarities to SARS-CoV (79.5%) and bat coronaviruses (96%). This means the virus may have originally come from bats. Scientists did more experiments that showed the virus probably went from bats to an intermediate host, meaning another animal in between bats and humans. The viruses in that other animal changed over time until they could infect humans. Scientists are close to sure that the original animal was a bat but not sure what the intermediate animal was. Some scientists think it could have been a pangolin because there are coronaviruses that live in pangolins even though they are not exactly the same as SARS-CoV-2 or the ones in bats. Pangolins are an endangered species and buying, selling or moving them from place to place is illegal in China and many other countries. But their scales are an ingredient in many traditional Chinese medicines, so they are often sold on the black market.

Although SARS-CoV-2 began in bats, scientists noticed that the bats do not get sick and die from it. They think this is because the bats have very careful immune systems that fight the virus without causing inflammation. Scientists are studying bats because of this.

Scientists are still looking at SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals, but only a variant strain has been confirmed to spread to minks. It is also inducing fear in humans as there are cases being reported of transmission of COVID-19 from minks to humans. Cats, dogs and other mammals are said to at relative risk but how they can get infected is still a mystery.

In early February 2020, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses' Coronavirus Study Group gave SARS-CoV-2 its official name, for sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus number two. Before that, people called the virus "2019-nCoV," for "novel (new) coronavirus that appeared in 2019." The study group chose this name because the new virus was so similar to another virus that was already called SARS-CoV with no number.

First, the virus enters the cell with the help of the S protein or spike protein expressed on the surface of the virus beyond its envelope. The spike protein attaches to the human cell receptor hACE2 or human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 "." ACE2 is found on the cells of the epithelial cell linings of the lungs, kidneys, and intestines. After the attachment of the S- protein to the virus, the S protein splits into its two components- S1 head and S2 stalk . The S1 head is now able to bind to the TMPRSS2 receptor which is a serine protease enzyme containing a transmembrane domain. The interaction of TMPRSS2 and S1 trigger the cell membrane of the human cell to merge with that of the virus leading to viral genome entry into cells via endosomes. The viral genome in the endosomes which convert to lysosomes is then processed by , which is then replicated in the human cells and released after viral packaging and maturation in the cells to infect others. In October 2020, scientists said they had seen SARS-CoV-2 use another receptor, , to enter cells with the help of the furin cleavage site in its genome which was not found in any of its previous ancestors.

SARS-CoV-2 can infect many kinds of cells, but it mostly infects cells in the respiratory system, such as the cells of the nose, pharynx and lungs. Because it is in cells inside the nose, it can spread via aerosol or droplets when people breathe, talk, cough or sneeze.

The expanding part of the lungs, pulmonary alveoli, have two main types of cells. One cell, type I, absorbs oxygen from the air, i.e. gas exchange. The other, type II, produces surfactants, that help keep the lungs fluid, clean, infection free, etc. COVID-19 finds a way into a surfactant producing type II cell, and smothers it by reproducing COVID-19 virus within it. Each type II cell which is killed by the virus causes an extreme reaction in the lungs. Fluids, pus, and dead cell material flood the lung, causing the coronavirus pulmonary disease.

Scientists looked at the lungs from people who died of COVID-19. They compared them to lungs from people who died of influenza A and to lungs from people who died but not from any problem with their lungs. They saw the cells that made up the skins of the blood vessels in the lungs were more badly damaged in the lungs from COVID-19 patients, and there was more blood clotting. The most important difference the scientists saw was that the lungs had begun to grow new blood vessels.

In February 2020, the World Health Organization announced they had chosen a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. "Covi" for "coronavirus," "D" for "disease," and "19" for the year 2019. They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it, like "Wuhan," or ‚Äúpangolin,‚Äù because then people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal. They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud.

According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs. People usually cough and have difficulty breathing. They often also have a fever, chills, headache, pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things.

According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea but this is rare. They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients threw up, about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs.

A study from the University of Arizona found that SARS-CoV-2 can prevent an infected person from feeling pain. It does this by giving off vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which binds to the human body's neuropilin receptor. This way, sick people do not feel pain, do not know they are sick, and spread the virus more than if they could feel pain.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus looks like a round ball with spikes all around it. There are four parts to the virus: the spikes, a membrane, an envelope, and the virus' genetic material, or ribonucleic acid (RNA) Each of these four parts is a different protein molecule. The spikes, membrane, and envelope are together called the "viral envelope", or outer layer, of the virus.

SARS-CoV-2 is a "positive-strand" RNA virus, meaning that it uses ribonucleic acid (RNA) to hold the patterns to make the proteins it needs instead of using DNA the way humans and other multicellular living things do.

In early 2020, some people began to think that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been made on purpose in a laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and released in Wuhan like a weapon. When the leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei, said that he did not want the United States to help his country against coronavirus, he named the idea that Americans had made the virus on purpose to harm Iranains as one of his reasons: "I do not know how real this accusation is but when it exists, who in their right mind would trust you to bring them medication?" said Khamenei.

One survey by Pew Research showed 29% of Americans who answered, thought SARS-CoV-2 could have been made in a lab on purpose and 23% thought it could have been made in a lab by accident. A survey of people in the United Kingdom showed many of them thought COVID-19 was caused by 5G wireless networks.

On March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in "Nature Medicine" showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory. They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. The paper in "Nature Medicine" soon became one of the most cited scientific papers of all time.

There are no fixed cures for the treatment of COVID-19, but there are various drugs that have been approved for use such as Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir which are detailed below. Other antiviral drugs, interferon therapy and combination of anti-viral and interferons are also being experimented on to get the best possible outcome for patients. These treatments are used to reduce the symptoms and to keep the patients comfortable.

In April 2020, scientists from the University of Pittsburgh said they had made a vaccine, called PittCoVacc and tested it in mice.

Another team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called APN01 and tested it in engineered human tissue, meaning human cells put together in a lab to look and act like they were inside a body. The scientists learned that adding human soluble recombinant angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to these tissues infected with SARS-CoV-2 made it harder for the virus to reproduce.

In late April 2020, a team from Oxford University announced that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine. The United States National Institutes of health tested it in rhesus monkeys, and it worked. The Oxford scientists said because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2. The scientists said they would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020.

In mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodies but they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal. Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work. The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people. Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021.

Some people think hydroxychloroquine, a medicine given to people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis, could work against COVID-19 and some do not. One study from China showed that COVID-19 patients who took hydroxychloroquine got better faster, but the study was not peer reviewed. Other studies in France and China seemed to show hydroxychloroquine helped, but the studies did not include control groups, meaning the doctors did not compare patients who took hydroxychloroquine to patients who did not, so they could not be sure it was the hydroxychloroquine that was helping them or whether it was something else. In March, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave doctors permission to give hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients.

United States President Donald Trump suggested the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine could help cure COVID-19, but Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is part of the White House's official coronavirus team said no one could know if hydroxychloroquine worked against SARS-CoV-2. In early April, the "New York Times" reported that President Trump has "a small personal financial interest" in Sanofi, one of the companies that makes hydroxychloroquine, meaning that if the company sold more hydroxychloroquine, he would have more wealth.

In early April, Fauci said, "The data are really just at best suggestive. There have been cases that show there may be an effect and there are others to show there's no effect." Dr. Megan L. Ranney of Brown University said that hydroxychloroquine can cause heart attacks and other problems. Other doctors worry that if people take hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, there will not be enough left for people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis. Still, some hospitals have given hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients who are very sick because the doctors think it is worth the risk.

Scientists in France and China performed more studies on larger groups of patients taking hydroxychloroquine. They watched patients who were taking the medicine and other treatment together and at patients who were only taking the other treatment. Both studies showed that hydroxychloroquine did not help and did cause side effects. Both studies were published in May 2020.

Some scientists thought the drug remdesivir, which was invented as a medicine for Ebola, could work against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir works against some viruses. Remdesivir had already been tested in humans, so the doctors already knew it would not hurt the patients even if it did not make them better. Because scientists already knew remdesivir was safe, they were able to start testing it in humans right away.

In one study, doctors gave a drug called remdesivir to 61 COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis, meaning they gave them the drug because there was no other treatment available. Scientists studied 53 of these patients and found that 68% of the patients got better, 13% died, and 25% had serious side effects. But because the study had no control group, meaning these patients were not compared to other COVID-19 patients who were not taking remdesivir, and because only 53 people were in the experiment, scientists must run more studies before they can be sure remdesivir works.

The chairman and CEO of the company that makes remdesivir, David O'Day, said that remdesivir might work better in some patients than in others and asked scientists to perform many different kinds of studies.
In October 2020, the National Institutes of Health told the world the results of its tests: They studied 11,000 people and found that remdesivir did not help keep COVID-19 patients alive.

The Stage

The Stage is a British weekly newspaper and website about theatre. It was first printed in 1880. It contains news, reviews, opinion, features, and job adverts, for people who work in theatre and the performing arts.

The first edition of "The Stage" was published (under the title "The Stage Directory ‚Äì a London and Provincial Theatrical Advertiser") on 1 February 1880 at a cost of 3 old pence for twelve pages. Publication was monthly until 25 March 1881. It was then printed weekly. The name was shortened to "The Stage" and the publication numbering restarted at number 1.

"The Stage" competed with other theatre newspapers (including "The Era"). The price was dropped to one penny and was soon the only remaining theatre newspaper.

The newspaper has remained in family ownership. Upon the death in 1937 of Charles Carson's son Lionel, who had assumed the joint role of managing director and editor, control passed to the Comerford family. The current managing director, Hugh Comerford, is founder Maurice's great-grandson.

In 1959 "The Stage" was changed to "The Stage and Television Today". It had a pull-out supplement of TV news and features. Derek Hoddinott, the main paper's TV editor, became editor of the new supplement.

In 1995, TV coverage was put back into the main paper. The name changed back to "The Stage".

In 2006, the paper introduced a blog on television, named "TV Today".

From 1995, the newspaper has awarded The Stage Awards for Acting Excellence at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

In 2004, 96-year-old contributor Simon Blumenfeld was recognised by "Guinness World Records" as the world's oldest weekly newspaper columnist. The column continued until shortly before his death in 2005.

In 2010, The Stage Awards were started. They are given each year. They recognise outstanding organisations working in theatre and beyond. They have the following categories: London theatre, regional theatre, producer, school, fringe theatre, theatre building, unsung hero and international.

In August 2013 "The Stage" started The Stage Castings, an online casting service with a video audition function.

In May 2019, "The Stage" partnered with the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation and UK Theatre to start Get Into Theatre, a website dedicated to theatre careers.

In 1956, writer John Osborne submitted his script for "Look Back in Anger" in response to an advertisement by the soon-to-be-launched Royal Court Theatre.

Dusty Springfield responded to an advertisement for female singers in 1958.

Harold Pinter gained his first job after responding to an advert in The Stage

In April 1981 the Editorial of The Stage announced the founding of Internationalist Theatre founded by Angelique Rockas with patron Athol Fugard implementing "a multi-racial drama policy, with an even mix of performers drawn from different cultural groups", starting with the revival of the London performance of Genet`s The Balcony.

Lineal championship

In combat sports where champions are decided by a challenge, the lineal championship of a weight class is a world championship title held initially by an undisputed champion and subsequently by a fighter who defeats the reigning champion in a match at that weight class. In professional boxing, the lineal champion is informally called "the man who beat the man".

Champions recognized by sanctioning bodies such as the World Boxing Association (WBA), World Boxing Council (WBC), or the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) may vacate their title voluntarily, or be stripped of the title for breaching the sanctioning body's regulations or contracts. There will thus be a breach of continuity in the list of sanctioned champions which the lineal championship is intended to prevent. However, there is no single canonical list of lineal champions at any weight class, because there is no agreed upon method of determining the starting point for each lineage and conflicting opinions on what to do when the current champion retires or moves to a different weight class, although there is agreement that any stripping of a title be discounted.

The Cathedral of Cefal√π () is a Roman Catholic basilica in Cefal√π, Sicily. It is one of nine structures included in the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as Arab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefal√π and Monreale.

The cathedral was built in 1131 in the Norman architectural style. The island of Sicily had been conquered by the Normans in 1091. According to tradition, the king of Sicily, Roger II, made a vow to build a cathedral, after he escaped from a storm to land on the city's beach. The building has a fortress-like character and dominates the skyline of the surrounding medieval town. It made a powerful statement of the Norman presence.

After 1172 the church suffered a period of decline. In 1215 Frederick II of Hohenstaufen moved the two sarcophagi to the Cathedral of Palermo. Construction of the cathedral was resumed soon after, the fa√ßade ws completed in 1240. The cathedral was consecrated in 1267 by Rodolphe de Chevri√™res, Bishop of Albano.

In 1472 a portico, by Ambrogio da Como, was added between the two towers of the facade.

Kerer≈´

The kerer≈´ ("Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae") is the only type of pigeon native to New Zealand. It is very big and easy to spot, and its wings make a loud sound when it flies. It is the only still-living New Zealand bird which can eat large fruits whole, and so is important for spreading the seeds of many native trees. Kerer≈´ were an important type of food for MƒÅori. There are much fewer kerer≈´ now than before the Europeans arrived in New Zealand, mostly because the Europeans brought meat-eating animals like cats, ferrets, stoats, possums, and rats, and cut down a lot of the forest. Because there are not many kerer≈´ any more, it is against the law to hunt them.

'Kerer≈´' is the most common name for this bird, but in some parts of the North Island it is called "k≈´k≈´" or "k≈´kupa." Kerer≈´ are also called "wood pigeon", but they are a different type of bird to the wood pigeon ("Columba palumbus") of the Northern Hemisphere.

Kerer≈´ are big and generally weigh between 550 and 850 grams. They have a white underbelly and dark green/blue head, shoulders, and wings. The green/blue colour is iridescent, meaning it is shiny and shows lots of different blues, greens, and purples in the sunlight.

Henotheism

Henotheism is the adherence to one particular god out of several, especially by a family, tribe, or other group.

Henotheism is sometimes defined as a monotheistic belief within a polytheistic world - believing that one god, or articulation of God, is better or clearer than others. Alternatively, henotheism is the worship of one god above an acknowledged pantheon. An example of this second form is the worship of a tribal god.

A henotheist would admit that many gods have real existence and are able to be worshipped. However the henotheist chooses to worship only one of these gods. This sets the henotheist apart from the polytheist who worships many gods.

It is commonly mistaken for "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog", an incorrect pangram, which mistakenly uses "jumped" instead of "jumps", thus excluding the letter "S".

Incendiary (movie)

Incendiary is a 2008 British drama film. It is about what happens after a terrorist attack at a football match. It is directed by Sharon Maguire. It stars Michelle Williams, Ewan McGregor, and Matthew Macfadyen. It is about a suicide bombing at the Emirates Stadium during an Arsenal F.C. match, and about the life of a woman who loses her husband and young son in the attack. It is based on the 2005 novel "Incendiary" by Chris Cleave.

A young East Ender woman, played by Michelle Williams, is married to bomb-disposal officer Lenny, played by Nicholas Gleaves. They have a four-year-old son, played by Sidney Johnston.

The young mother is having an affair with a reporter called Jasper, palyed by Ewan McGregor. Lenny, their son, and about 1000 others are killed in a terrorist attack carried out by six suicide bombers at a football match. 
Terrence Butcher, played by Matthew Macfadyen, is in charge of the anti-terrorist division.
Jasper and Terrence try to comfort the mother. Both are also romantically interested in her.

Through Jasper's investigation into the bombing, the mother discovers the identity of one of the terrorists. She befriends his teenage son, played by Usman Khokhar. He only knows that his father is missing since the attacks. When he finds out what his father did, he panics and runs. This causes the police to suspect him to be a terrorist. When he tries to take something out of his pocket they think he has a gun or wants to trigger a bomb. They shoot at him, but he is unarmed. The mother, who tried to protect him, is wounded, but not severely. Later, the terrorist's wife and son apologize to the mother for his part in the killings.

Terrence confesses to the mother that he knew that a suicide attack was going to happen and could have stopped it. He did not stop it so that he was able to continue his investigation of the terrorist group. He says that he did not know in which stadium it would happen, and also thought it would be of a smaller scale. Although he knew Lenny and his son would be going, he did not warn them.

Sometimes the mother is confused, thinking that nothing has happened to her son. Throughout the film, she writes a letter addressed to Osama bin Laden. He is assumed to be responsible for the attack.


Filming began on 26 March 2007 in London, England. Scenes were filmed on location in Northampton Square and the Brunswick Estate in Islington, North London. Filming also took place at Leyton Orient's Brisbane Road stadium and around St Albans Cathedral, St Albans School, and Westminster Lodge.

The production also visited The Metropolitan Training College facilities near Gravesend to shoot the scenes at the football stadium, after the bomb has exploded.

The film received poor reviews. Tom Charity, after viewing the film at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, gave it one star out of five. He called it an "ambitious/opportunistic effort that misses the mark, from the one-dimensional characters to the craven plotting and sentimental tone."

Philip French called it an "ambitious British picture on an urgent topical subject [that] is torpedoed by a poor script."

"Time Out" gave it two stars out of six. It wrote "there are so many things wrong with writer-director Sharon Maguire‚Äôs first film since "Bridget Jones's Diary" in 2001 that it's hard to know where to start, but the fatal problem is that this is a film with an identity crisis"; the film at times seems like a "study of guilt and grief" and at other times a "conspiracy thriller" but "ends up being a compendium of bizarre diversions, most of which are utterly surplus to the film‚Äôs half-cocked desire to stick with the experience and emotions of its main character."

Escape Room 2

Escape Room: Tournament of Champions is a 2021 psychological horror movie directed by Adam Robitel. The movie stars Taylor Russell, Logan Miller, Isabelle Fuhrman, Thomas Cocquerel, Holland Roden, Carlito Olivero, and Indya Moore. It serves as a sequel to the 2019 movie "Escape Room".

After escaping the "sole survivor" escape rooms orchestrated by the Minos Corporation, Zoey Davis and Ben Miller decide to confront the shadowy organization after finding coordinates to its New York City‚Äìbased headquarters. Zoey is encouraged by her therapist to move on from her trauma and to get over her aerophobia, but she opts to drive with Ben instead of flying.

The pair find the headquarters derelict and are accosted by a vagrant who steals Zoey's necklace. She and Ben give chase straight into the Q subway train. Their train car separates from the rest of the train and is redirected to a remote station, sealing Zoey, Ben, and other passengers Rachel, Brianna, Nathan, and Theo inside. As the passengers realize in horror that they are once again in Minos' deadly game, the train becomes electrified. Zoey and Ben learn that the others are the "winners" of previous escape rooms, having survived them. To escape, the group must collect subway tokens as the electrification increases. Theo is killed while the rest escape. Nathan reveals his escape room group were all priests, Brianna's were all influencers, and Rachel's consisted of people who cannot feel physical pain.

The next room is a bank with a slowly closing vault and a deadly laser security system. The group manages to decipher the complex route to get around the lasers and escape with just seconds to spare. While in the room, Zoey is perplexed by frequent references to someone called Sonya and that the escape rooms have no apparent connection to the group unlike before.

The next room is a postcard-like beach with more references to Sonya. They discover that the beach is covered in quicksand. Nathan sacrifices himself to save Rachel and is swallowed up by the sand. Zoey finds an alternate route out just as Brianna unlocks the intended exit. An argument on which route to take breaks out; Rachel and Ben side with Zoey. Brianna escapes through the main exit while Rachel and Ben traverse to the alternate route. Ben falls into the quicksand.

Zoey and Rachel make their way out through a manhole back into the city. Overjoyed at first that they're outside, they quickly realize they are still in the game when they encounter a panicked Brianna. If they don't make it out of this room, acid rain is periodically sprayed on them. The group opens a taxi to escape into but once Zoey enters, the taxi locks Rachel and Brianna out. Zoey falls into the next room while Rachel and Brianna succumb to the rain and die.

The next room is a child's bedroom containing a diary from Sonya, revealing the rooms are based on a fun day out she had with her mother. Zoey discovers Sonya's mother is Amanda Harper, who survived her fall in her original escape room and was forced into designing escape rooms for Minos after they abducted her daughter. Amanda appears and begs Zoey to become the next puzzle-maker for Minos, warning that she has no choice. Ben is revealed to be trapped in a cage. When Zoey refuses Minos' demand, Ben's cage starts filling with water, but Zoey and Amanda work together to free him. They manage to break out, fleeing the facility. They report their findings to the police, who retrieve the bodies of Rachel, Brianna, Nathan, and Theo; the news about Minos goes public. An FBI agent assures Zoey that Minos will be tracked down.

Filled with confidence, Zoey decides to take a plane home with Ben. Onboard, she realizes her therapist was in on it and that the plane is another escape room. The distorted voice of Minos' leader mocks Zoey and Ben for falling into their latest trap as the plane begins to fall and sleeping gas fills the cabin.


Isabelle Fuhrman and James Frain appear in the film's alternate version as Claire and Henry, respectively, in a plotline revealing the puzzlemaker's story. Tanya van Graan makes an uncredited appearance as Sonya, who is Henry's wife and Claire's mother in this cut.

Additionally, Lucy Newman-Williams appears as Zoey's therapist and Scott Coker portrays an FBI agent in the theatrical cut. In both versions, Matt Esof portrays the vagrant who lures Zoey and Ben into Minos' trap.

On January 27, 2020, director Adam Robitel posted on social media confirming that filming on the movie had wrapped.


Appetite for Destruction

Appetite for Destruction is the first studio album by American hard rock band Guns N' Roses. It was released on July 21, 1987, through Geffen Records.

When the album as released in 1987, it was not popular. Next year, in 1988, it became very successful after the band had toured and radio stations played the singles "Welcome to the Jungle", "Paradise City" and "Sweet Child o' Mine". It was first on "Billboard" 200 and became the best-selling debut album of all time, as well as the eleventh best-selling album of all time in the United States. With more than 30 million copies sold worldwide, it is also one of the best-selling records of all time.

Although critics at first had mixed feelings toward the album, "Appetite for Destruction" is now liked by critics and is considered as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2018, it was re-released as a remastered box set with critics liking it too.

Guns N' Roses first recordings were for a planned EP in March 1985. This was shortly after the band formed. The recording included a cover of "Heartbreak Hotel". "Don't Cry ", "Think About You" and "Anything Goes". The EP did not happen because original guitarist Tracii Guns left the band. He was replaced by Slash. Shortly afterward, a new lineup of Axl Rose, Duff McKagan, Slash, Steven Adler and Izzy Stradlin was confirmed. This is the classic lineup for the band.

After playing many shows in Los Angeles clubs, the group signed with Geffen Records in March 1986. In December 1986, the group released the four-song EP "Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide", which was made to keep people interested in the band while it started work in the studio. The label also thought the band didn't have enough songs, so they made the EP.

Singer Axl Rose said that many of the songs on the album were written while the band was performing on the Los Angeles club circuit, and a number of songs that would be featured on later Guns N' Roses albums were considered for "Appetite for Destruction", such as "Back Off Bitch", "You Could Be Mine", "November Rain" and "Don't Cry". "November Rain" was not put on the album because "Sweet Child O' Mine" is already on it. They only wanted one ballad.

Producer Spencer Proffer was hired to record "Nightrain" and "Sweet Child o' Mine" to test if he could work with the band. They eventually recorded nine songs during these sessions, including "Heartbreak Hotel", "Don't Cry", "Welcome to the Jungle" and "Shadow of Your Love". In mid to late 1986, the band recorded demos with Nazareth guitarist Manny Charlton, which were released in 2018. (See Below for more info)
The band at first considered Paul Stanley of KISS to produce, but he was rejected after he wanted to change Adler's drum set more than Adler wanted. Robert John "Mutt" Lange was also considered, but the label didn't want to spend the extra money on a famous producer. Ultimately, Mike Clink (who had produced several Triumph records) was chosen, and the group recorded "Shadow of Your Love" first with Clink as a test.

In 1999, Rose re-recorded the album with the lineup at the time (Rose, Robin Finck, Tommy Stinson, Paul Tobias, Josh Freese, Dizzy Reed & Chris Pitman) to "spruce up" the album with new recording techniques. The re-recorded version of the album was never released, although an edited clip of "Sweet Child O' Mine" featuring the second half of the song using the re-recorded version was included over the credits of the movie "Big Daddy" in 1999.

The "Locked N' Loaded" Edition and the "Super Deluxe Edition" have the same musical contents. Disc one is the original album.

A fifth disc is included; a Blu-ray disc, which has 96¬†kHz 24-bit 5.1 Surround Sound & Remastered Stereo mixes, mixed by Elliot Scheiner and Frank Filipetti. It includes all of "Appetite for Destruction", alongside bonus tracks "Shadow of Your Love", "Patience", "Used to Love Her", "You're Crazy", and "Move to the City (1988 Acoustic version)". In addition, it includes music videos for "Welcome to the Jungle", "Sweet Child O' Mine", "Paradise City", "Patience", and a previously unreleased video of "It's So Easy".

Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes.

The Brittas Empire

The Brittas Empire is a British sitcom created by Andrew Norriss and Richard Fegen.

Chris Barrie plays Gordon Brittas. He is the well-meaning but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre.

The show ran for seven series and 52 episodes ‚Äî including two Christmas specials ‚Äî from 1991 to 1997 on BBC1. Norriss and Fegen wrote the first five series.

"The Brittas Empire" had large audiences. In 2004 the show came 47th on the BBC's "Britain's Best Sitcom" poll.

The show combined farce with surreal dramatic elements. For example, in the first series, the leisure centre prepares for a royal visit, only for the doors to seal, the boiler room to flood and a visitor to be electrocuted. Unlike the traditional sitcom, deaths were quite common in "The Brittas Empire".

Gordon Brittas (played by Chris Barrie) is the well-meaning but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre. He trained at the fictional Aldershot Leisure Centre. He is tactless, annoying and has 'half-baked' ideas. He is oblivious to all of his faults. Brittas frequently upsets his staff, the public, and his wife Helen. He often brings confusion and chaos into their lives.

Helen Brittas, played by Pippa Haywood, finds it hard to cope with Gordon. She often turns to pills and affairs with other men to maintain her sanity. She is also helped by Brittas's calm and efficient deputy, Laura Lancing, played by Julia St John. Laura has a grudging admiration for Brittas whom she regards as honest and decent.

Brittas's other deputy, the dim-witted Colin Weatherby, is played by Mike Burns. Colin has several skin allergies and a constantly infected hand. Though he is an assistant manager, he works as the centre's caretaker. Carole, played by Harriet Thorpe, is the often tearful receptionist who keeps her three children in the drawers of the reception desk. Amongst other members of the team is Julie, played by Judy Flynn. Julie is a sarcastic secretary who hates her boss and refuses to do any work. Lively Linda, played by Jill Greenacre, gentle-hearted Gavin, played by Tim Marriott, and his paranoid partner Tim, played by Russell Porter, are more co-operative members of the team. Carole's son Ben was played by Jonathon Norriss.

"The Brittas Empire" was broadcast for fifty-two episodes between 1991 and 1997, spanning seven series and two Christmas Specials. There was also one short episode for Children in Need. The cast also performed in the 1996 Royal Variety Performance. Chris Barrie played Brittas again in the short fitness series spin-off called "Get Fit with Brittas".

For the first five series the show's creators Richard Fegen and Andrew Norriss co-wrote the show, after which they left, along with actress Julia St John who played Laura. Series five was originally meant to be the final series, and Norriss and Fegen killed off Brittas at its end, when he was crushed to death by a falling water tank.

However, the show's popularity meant the BBC resurrected Brittas and brought on a team of new writers, who carried the show on for a further two series, including one further Christmas special in 1996. These writers were: Paul Smith, Terry Kyan, Tony Millan, Mike Walling, Ian Davidson and Peter Vincent.

'Curse of the Tiger Women' is the final episode in 1997. This ending claims all seven series were part of a dream that Brittas is having on his way to the job interview for manager of the leisure centre. It is an ending that is regarded as poor by many critics and viewers, and contradicts the 1994 Christmas Special by Fegen and Norriss, showing what happens to the staff post-Whitbury Leisure Centre.

In 2014, Chris Barrie reprised his role as Gordon Brittas for a brief appearance in the Sport Relief music video, 'Word Up!' by Little Mix.

All seven series were released on DVD in the United Kingdom by Eureka Video, and also in Australia by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The BBC released episodes on VHS in the 1990s.


Critics John Lewis and Penny Stempel commented that: 

In its positioning of an incompetent in charge of others, "The Brittas Empire" mined the traditional vein of TV humour (e.g., Dad's Army or Are You Being Served?). Yet it also had an element of absurdism...which gave it an appeal to younger viewers. At a stretch the show could also be viewed as a critique of the managerial class which expanded in the Thatcherite eighties. A show for all the couch.
The show has been credited with having an influence on Alan Partridge and "The Office".

The exterior shots and interior swimming pools of 'Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre' were filmed at Ringwood Leisure Centre, Hampshire.

Collectivism

Collectivism is a kind of ethics based on people being a group. Its opposite is individualism which is based on people being individuals. Collectivists focus on what's good for a whole group. Individualists focus on what's good for each person. Collectivism and individualism are and are also part of politics.

The word "individualism" was originally used by socialists to attack their enemies. They said that individualists were selfish for not supporting socialism. Instead, individualists support people being independent and chasing their own goals. They also believe in having lots of freedoms.

Collectivists believe that one person is not as important as a group of many people. They often believe people should compromise to make things better for each other instead of just themselves. They also think that letting someone do whatever they want is not good if it hurts lots of other people. Collectivism has many different types. It can mean serving your community, your government, your social class, your race, or some other group.

Draize test

The Draize test is a test, to see if a substance is toxic. John H. Draize and Jacob M. Spines first used the test in 1944. The test was first used for cosmetics, but later for other substances as well. To see if a substance is toxic, it is applied to the skin or the eye of an animal, for a given time. After the time, the substance is washed out and the effects are recorded. Very often, small animals, such as rabbits were used. After the test, the animals are observed for up to 14 days. If the test does irreversible damage to the skin or the eye, the animal is killed after the test. Animals may be re-used for testing purposes if the product tested causes no permanent damage. Animals are typically reused after a "wash out" period during which all traces of the tested product are allowed to disperse from the test site.

The tests are controversial. They are seem as cruel and unscientific because of the differences between rabbit and human eyes, and the subjective nature of the visual evaluations. The FDA supports the test, stating that "to date, no single test, or battery of tests, has been accepted by the scientific community as a replacement [for] ... the Draize test". Because of its controversial nature, the use of the Draize test in the U.S. and Europe has declined in recent years and is sometimes modified so that anaesthetics are administered and lower doses of the test substances used. Chemicals already shown to have adverse effects "in vitro" are not currently used in a Draize test, thereby reducing the number and severity of tests that are carried out.

Other tests have been developed which can replace the Draize test for many applications: First there is a test that uses chicken eggs. Another test uses Spanish slugs. 

Hen's egg test on chorioallantoic membrane

The Hen's egg test on chorioallantoic membrane, or hen's egg test is a test that can be used to test the toxicity of substances. It is also often used to test vaccines. It is a CAM Assay. The product to be tested is applied to a special membrane. Such tests were first used because chicken eggs were easily available. As the respective membrane does not contain any nerve cells, it is likely that the developing bird embryo does not feel pain during the test. These tests are not considered to be animal testing.

This test can be used as a replacement for the Draize test, as it similarly detects irritation response in cosmetics. 

Social choice theory

Social choice theory, which is also called theory of collective choice, is a theory that looks at how a group of people reach a decision.

It was divided in three sections ("Circondari" in Italian):


The population in the 1939 Census was of nearly 225,000 inhabitants, most of which were Arabs and Berbers. The Italians were nearly 10,000 and were concentrated in Misurata, Homs and some newly created villages for Italian colonists (Gioda, Crispi, Littoriano, Corradini, etc.)

Most of the population was Muslim, but there was a growing community of Catholics due to the Italian colonists immigration. Additionally there were nearly one thousand Jews in Misurata.

The province from 1939 was considered officially part of the Kingdom of Italy, with the same laws. It was one of the 4 new Italian provinces of the so-called "Quarta Sponda" (Fourth Shore) of Mussolini's Greater Italia. Indeed on January 9, 1939, the colony of Italian Libya was incorporated into "metropolitan Italy" and thereafter considered an integral part of the Italian state (the French, in 1848, had incorporated "French Algeria" in the same manner).

Penguin (biscuit)

Penguins are a type of biscuit that is made in Lancashire. They are a bar shaped biscuits that are covered in milk chocolate. The biscuits are filled with chocolate cream. Pladis' manufacturing division McVitie's makes them at their factory in Stockport.

They were first made in 1932 by William McDonald, a biscuit manufacturer in Glasgow. They became a brand of McVitie's when McDonald joined with McVitie's and Price, MacFarlane Lang & Co and Crawford to create United Biscuits in 1948. Each wrapper has a joke or "funny fact" printed on it and designs that feature penguins that are often in styles like that of famous works of art. These designs are usually funny.

In the 1980s, Penguin became known for their television advertising slogan "P...P...P...Pick up a penguin!‚Äù

In October 1996, United Biscuits sued Asda because they said Asda said their own brand of "Puffin" biscuits were part of the Penguin brand. In March 1997, United Biscuits won the case. The court found out Asda had not broken any laws on how the Penguin brand could be used. 

United Biscuits was criticised for still using trans fatty acids in the cream filling of Penguins. By December 2007, United Biscuits began to publicly say trans fats are not in Penguins anymore. 

The Tim Tam made by Arnott's in Australia was based on the Penguin. Occasional references in the media include tongue-in-cheek debates over which biscuit is better.

There are currently three versions of the biscuit:

In 2002, McVitie's made some versions of the Penguin biscuit: Penguin Chukkas, Wing Dings, Flipper Dipper, Splatz and Mini Splatz. There is a ¬£5 million promotional campaign for the biscuits. In 2008, McVitie's also made Penguin triple chocolate wafers.

Jekyll (TV series)

Jekyll is a British television drama serial shown on BBC One. Steven Moffat wrote all six episodes. Douglas Mackinnon and Matt Lipsey directed three episodes each.

It was made by Hartswood Films and Stagescreen Productions. The series also got funding from BBC America.

The series is a sequel to the novella "Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde", and not an adaptation of it. The Robert Louis Stevenson tale is used as a backstory within the series.

It stars James Nesbitt as Tom Jackman, a modern-day descendant of Dr. Jekyll. He has recently begun transforming into a version of Mr. Hyde (also played by Nesbitt). Jackman is aided by psychiatric nurse Katherine Reimer, played by Michelle Ryan. Gina Bellman appears as Claire, Tom's wife.

Filming took place around southern England in late 2006. The series was first shown on BBC One in June and July 2007.

Doctor Tom Jackman (James Nesbitt) is a married father of two. He has abandoned his family without explanation to live in a heavily fortified basement flat. He hires psychiatric nurse Katherine Reimer (Michelle Ryan) to help him. After explaining a set of elaborate security procedures to Katherine, he straps himself into a metal chair and undergoes a transformation.

Katherine observes that Tom's alter ego exhibits rage, heightened senses, strength and speed, and a flirtatious manner. She assures this persona she will keep his secrets just as she keeps Tom's. She asks for guarantees he will not harm her. Tom's alter ego takes Hyde's name. The two agree an uneasy truce. They share a body, but neither remembers what the other did while in charge. They use a micro cassette recorder to leave messages for each other.

When Tom began transforming into the violent Hyde, he feared for his family's safety. He chose to isolate himself from them. He visits his wife Claire (Gina Bellman). During the visit, Hyde assumes control and learns about Tom's family.

Miranda Callendar, played by Meera Syal, is a detective employed by Claire. She tells Tom that "Jekyll and Hyde" was not fiction, but a version of actual events. Miranda shows Tom a picture of the real Doctor Jekyll who lived in Edinburgh in the 19th century. Tom is startled to see that Jekyll looks exactly like him.

Tom is also being watched by a private security team led by an American named Benjamin, played by Paterson Joseph. The team works for his former employers at the biotechnology firm, Klein and Utterson. The team is directed by his friend Peter Syme, played by Denis Lawson.

When Benjamin puts Tom's children at risk, Hyde asserts himself, and kills a lion. At the hospital he is approached by Sophia, an elderly woman who claims to be his mother, but before he can question her she disappears.

Tom confronts Peter, who attempts to drug him. This provokes Hyde to appear and take Peter and Claire hostage. Claire argues that they need to find a cure for Tom's condition. Hyde kills Benjamin. Peter says that Klein and Utterson have had a cure for a long time. Tom is captured and locked inside a metal coffin.

Katherine and Miranda confront Peter, claiming they know the truth about Tom. Miranda thinks that Klein and Utterson have access to cloning technology and that Tom is Jekyll's clone. Peter denies this and orders them taken away to be killed.

Peter reveals to Claire that Tom's treatment will make him into one persona. If it is Hyde, he will be kept for research. They will make the potion that turned the original Jekyll into Hyde. If it is Tom, she will be free to take him home. When the box is opened, Hyde is dominant.

In a flashback triggered by genetic memory, Hyde has a vision of a meeting between Jekyll and Robert Louis Stevenson, the author of "Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde". Stevenson agrees to write a fictional version of Jekyll's case but reveals that he knows the truth: there is no potion. Instead, Jekyll was transformed into Hyde by his love for Alice, a maid within his household. Flashbacks into Tom's own life show his Hyde first appeared during a seaside holiday with Claire, after the pair were accosted by hooligans.

Enraged by further threats to Tom's family, Hyde escapes from Klein and Utterson. Ms. Utterson, a ruthless redheaded American woman at the head of Klein and Utterson, takes Claire and her sons hostage at a private estate. She locks the twins in miniature versions of the coffin used on their father.

Tom's alleged mother, Sophia, appears on the premises and helps Claire escape her locked bedroom. She tells Claire how Klein and Utterson had tried to clone Doctor Jekyll but had been unsuccessful. Claire meets several of the failed attempts in the basement of the building. They are disfigured and in a near-vegetative state. Sophia explains that Tom is a descendant of Doctor Jekyll, through Mr Hyde, and by chance "a perfect throwback, a chance in a million". Klein and Utterson had discovered this and had watched him from when he was six-months-old. In order to trigger his transformation into Hyde, they created a clone of Alice, the maid whom Jekyll had loved. This clone is Claire herself.

Hyde tries to rescue Tom's family from Klein and Utterson. He kills Peter. There is a stand-off, with Tom and Claire's sons held hostage and suffocating. The Hyde personality is apparently killed when he is shot with multiple bullets and then manages to avoid 'sharing the damage' by taking the wounds onto himself while allowing Tom to assume his undamaged, healthy form, leaving Doctor Jackman as the only personality.

Six months later, Tom has tracked down Sophia, the woman who claimed to be his mother. When he questions her about his father, she reveals that she is the descendant of Hyde. He had inherited the family curse from her. As Tom watches horrified, the powerless, tired, grey-haired Sophia transforms into her own version of the Hyde persona, the red-headed Ms Utterson.


Jeffrey Tayor of Stagescreen Productions had the idea of a modern version of "Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde" in the mid-1990s. He attempted to get it produced in the United States, but all three attempts fell through. He returned to England and joined with Hartswood Films when Elaine Cameron was looking for ideas for a supernatural thriller. Cameron approached Steven Moffat for a script. A six-part series was commissioned by the BBC's Jane Tranter and John Yorke in November 2005.
BBC America gave co-production funding in March 2006. The producers regularly met with Moffat for brainstorming sessions. The producers invited Moffat to "write anything", with the intention of cutting the material back later. However, they were reluctant to cut material once they saw it on the page. The first episode starts with Jackman already knowing about his alter ego. Because the plot of "Jekyll" begins after the story has developed for the characters, Nesbitt says that the show feels like it is a second series.

Moffat explicitly describes the series as a sequel, rather than an adaptation. He said the Jekyll of the original story really existed, and Jackman is his "modern-day descendant dealing with the same problems". As "Jekyll and Hyde" is such a well-known phrase, Moffat labored over what to call the series, eventually deciding upon "Jekyll" because that word "carries the name Hyde". The final episode replaces the title "Jekyll" with "Hyde". Producer Elaine Cameron says the one word title gives the series a "very modern feel". Moffat initially named the character Jekyll rather than Jackman, but found it cumbersome to constantly explain that the book had not been written in this alternate universe. Instead he chose a version where the book exists, but changed the name to Jackman. Otherwise, Cameron felt, the character would appear stupid by not realising what was happening when turning into Hyde.

The scene between Tom and Katherine was expanded slightly in the sixth episode to keep their relationship active to facilitate a second series. However, no further episodes were commissioned. In an August 2007 interview, Moffat told Alan Sepinwall of "The Star-Ledger" that he had a sequel written for the miniseries "should the BBC be interested".

Following "Jekyll," Moffat became a co-writer on "Sherlock."

James Nesbitt and his agent attended a meeting with Jane Tranter in late 2005 regarding the 2006 series of "Murphy's Law". At the conclusion of the meeting, she offered him a script for "Jekyll", suggesting that he might like the role. Nesbitt took the script role as a way of putting a distance between his previous work. The casting of Nesbitt as Tom Jackman and Hyde was publicised on 12 December 2005, but filming was not scheduled to begin until September 2006, increasing Nesbitt's anticipation to play the roles. Writer Steven Moffat said that the dual-role required a very skilled actor, and a well-known actor was necessary because it was such an expensive show to produce. The production team decided Nesbitt's two characters would be mainly differentiated over a change in performance rather than by extensive make-up because they wanted Hyde to be able to walk around in public without attracting attention.

Michelle Ryan was revealed to have been cast as Jekyll's assistant, Katherine Reimer, in August 2006. Ryan believed herself to be too young for the part, though that aspect had already been written into the character. To prepare, she consulted the Royal College of Psychiatry. Ryan dyed her hair red for the role to help differentiate her from Tom Jackman's wife. Denis Lawson was cast as Peter Syme. The actor consulted his post-graduate son for information on Syme's job.

Moffat initially doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for the role of Claire Jackman because he associated her too much with Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom "Coupling". Moffat did not imagine the character to be as beautiful as Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned for the role of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked herself out of the role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers.

Meera Syal was attracted to her role because Miranda was not a clich√©d private detective and she thought the humour was "fresh". During the second filming block, Mark Gatiss briefly joined the cast, playing the small but important role of Robert Louis Stevenson in flashback scenes in episode five.

Other roles included Paterson Joseph as Benjamin Maddox, Linda Marlowe as Ms Utterson and Al Hunter Ashton as Christopher.

The series was filmed in two blocks of three episodes. The first three were directed by Douglas Mackinnon and the second three episodes by Matt Lipsey. It took an hour of make-up each day to turn Nesbitt into Hyde; a hairpiece lowered his hairline and prosthetics were added to his chin, nose and ear lobes. He also wore black contact lenses to make Hyde "soulless". The producers decided that Hyde's imminent arrival would be indicated by the flash of a black eye. The eye imagery evolved during filming, and did not appear in the script.

Filming began in September 2006 with the zoo sequence from the second episode. Benjamin's team have set Tom up to force out Hyde by placing his son, Eddie, in the lion's den. Writing the sequence at a late stage in the production, Moffat wanted to compare Hyde's natural instinct to kill to that of a lion. This was shot on location at Heythrop Zoo, a private zoo in Chipping Norton run by Jim Clubb, whose firm Amazing Animals specialises in training animals for cinema and television. The Norman Foster-designed building in Chertsey, Surrey, which then housed the European Headquarters of video game designer and publisher Electronic Arts, was used as The Klein & Utterson Institute. A large country estate near Henley-on-Thames and in Bognor Regis was used for some of the scenes. A disused Boys' school in Gloucestershire, and the Hammer House in Wardour Street, Soho were used in episode six. Filming concluded on 20 December 2006.

The production team had twelve days to shoot each episode. Director Douglas Mackinnon says this was the biggest challenge of the project. The required amount of material was shot for most of the episodes. However, an extra twenty minutes of material was filmed for episode six. Director Matt Lipsey recalls that the team struggled to cut the extra material whilst maintaining the integrity of the episode. Lipsey credits Moffat for not "being precious" over his material during the editing process. His willingness to cut superfluous material meant that he was taken seriously when he argued for something to be retained.

The music was composed by Debbie Wiseman.

"Jekyll" was shown on BBC One on Saturday nights at 9p.m. A two-week break occurred between showings of the third and fourth episodes because the Live Earth benefit concert was broadcast during its timeslot on 7 July.

Certain edits were made to the United Kingdom broadcasts in order to remove language unsuitable for Saturday night BBC One audiences. For example, a line spoken by Hyde in episode one was changed from "Who the fuck is Mr Hyde?" to "Who the hell is Mr Hyde?"

James Jackson of "The Times" rated the first episode four out of five stars, calling Nesbitt's performance as Hyde "as entertainingly [over the top] as a dozen "Doctor Who" villains, with a palpable sense of menace to boot". The conspiracy plot is praised as a storyline that separates this series from other adaptations. "The Daily Telegraph's" Stephen Pile criticised the script for "veering between Hammer horror and larky humour". James Walton called the first episode a combination of "a good yarn with several nicely thoughtful touches". David Cornelius of "DVDTalk" said "six episodes, 300 minutes, not a single one of them wasted. 'Jekyll' is this year's finest television event".
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation, commenting on the series being part of their 2008 line-up, said "This classic horror tale has been given a modern make-over that will leave you on the edge of your seat and begging for more. James Nesbitt is outstanding as the new Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde". Nesbitt was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television for his roles. Paterson Joseph received a mention in the nominations for the 2008 Screen Nation awards.

The BBFC rated all episodes as a 15 certificate on 11 June 2007. "Jekyll: Season One" was released for region 2 on 30 July 2007 by Contender Home Entertainment. It includes uncut episodes, including restoration of some swearing cut from the BBC broadcasts. As DVD Verdict says about this uncut version, "the language is saucier, the violence a bit more bloody, and the sex more primal." The disc contains audio commentaries on two episodes: producer Elaine Cameron, writer Steven Moffat and first-block director Douglas Mackinnon comment on episode one, while executive producer Beryl Vertue, second-block director Matt Lipsey and actress Gina Bellman comment upon the sixth episode. The set also contains two documentaries: "Anatomy of a Scene" focuses upon the production of the zoo sequence in episode two, while "The Tale Retold" covers the evolution of the series. The first Region 1 release occurred in the United States on 18 September 2007, although the Region 1 Canadian release was delayed until 9 October, following the Canadian broadcast of the series on Showcase, which commenced at the end of August 2007.

Jevons paradox

In economics, Jevons paradox is a paradox about resource usage. It is also called Jevons effect, after William Stanley Jevons who first observed it in 1865. Jevons observed that the steam engine James Watt had developed was much more efficient that the earlier model of Thomas Newcomen. Despite this, the use of coal in England increased. The improvements James Watt had introduced made coal a cheap source of energy. As a consequence, Watt's steam engine was more popular, and its use was more widespread. So even though each steam engine used less coal, the demand for coal increased, as there were more steam engines.

Floating exchange rate

A floating exchange rate is when the exchange rate between two currencies can change freely. It is also known as flexible exchange rate, or fluctuating exchange rate. Supply and demand will influence the exchange rate. Today, floating exchange rates between currencies are common. Usually, the market will regulate the exchange rate. In most cases, the central banks of the affected countries will not intervene. They might do something, if the exchange rate rises above a certain threshold, or it falls below a minimal value. 

The opposite is a fixed exchange rate, or pegged exchange rate.

Fixed exchange rate system

In a fixed exchange rate, a state authority defines an exchange rate of its own currency, against another currency, a basket of currencies, or some good, such as gold. The central bank of the country will then guarantee this exchange rate; it will buy or sell its currency at this rate.

London's Burning (TV series)

London's Burning is a British television drama programme. It was produced by London Weekend Television for the ITV network. It is about the lives of members of the London Fire Brigade at the fictional Blackwall fire station. It began with a TV movie pilot, shown on 7 December 1986. There were 14 series. They ran from 20 February 1988 to 25 August 2002.

Jack Rosenthal's original two-hour TV movie was shown on ITV on 7 December 1986.

It was directed by Les Blair. The Broadwater Farm riot inspired the screenplay.

The TV show was a weekly episodic drama that began on 20 February 1988. Paul Knight was the show's producer. Writers included Anita Bronson, David Humphries, Simon Sharkey, and Tony Hoare (writer). Directors included Gerry Poulson, Gerry Mill, John Reardon, Keith Washington and Alan Wareing. Emergencies, called 'shouts', would not only be fires, but included a range of incidents from cats up trees to major road accidents. Each episode ran for 50 minutes (one hour with advertisement breaks). The first series had five episodes. The second and third series each had eight episodes. Episodes were mostly filmed at Dockhead fire station in Bermondsey in London. Real firefighters working shifts were extras on the programme. A studio near the station was used for crowded mess scenes. They also used the fire station's actual mess, bay and watchroom throughout the series.

A Christmas special was transmitted between series 1 and 2 on 25 December 1988, on ITV. The special followed Blue Watch on duty on Christmas Day.

On 8 September 1991, a special 30-minute behind-the-scenes documentary started the fourth series. This documentary was also released onto VHS video, by Clear Vision Video. It was then added as a DVD extra, on the Series 4 DVD release by Network DVD.

In 1991, LWT commissioned 10 episodes for Series 4. It became the most popular series of the drama. Paul Knight had appointed Brian Clark as the Fire Brigade Advisor. The writers, directors, and Clark decided on a climax to the fourth series. The mental state of one of the main characters deteriorates after being buried alive under a collapsed wall. This is during a spectacular 20-pump warehouse fire. Series 4's climax won the programme a record rating of 18.86¬†million viewers.

Each series now included a major disaster or "shout". In Series 5, a spinning wheel ride at a fairground is jammed by a youth, played by Liam McGuire, armed with a pole. The ride collapses, and there is a huge fire with people trapped in the crushed metal. The series attracted 17 million viewers.

In the early 1990s, the ratings averaged 17‚Äì18¬†million viewers. In 1995 (Series 8), ratings fell to 16¬†million viewers.

Paul Knight decided it was time for a tragic exit for one of the main characters. The man who was to be killed was Sub Officer John Hallam. Hallam was killed off in 1996 (Series 9) during a huge warehouse fire. He and his colleague, Leading Firefighter Geoff Pearce, were attempting to rescue four teenage girls. They were on an unstable gantry above a blaze in the basement. Hallam held the gantry steady for Pearce as he walked across with one of the girls. As Hallam attempted to cross, the gantry cracked and Hallam fell to his death. The writers developed a storyline about Pearce feeling an overwhelming sense of guilt after the accident, which would lead to him considering a transfer.

Series 9 attracted 16.8¬†million viewers.

Series 10 was the last series produced by Paul Knight. It had 18 episodes. It focused on the crew's domestic lives rather than firefighting work. Budget cuts led to scenes being done with computer-generated imagery. Notable 'shouts' included ones at a paint factory and another at a bus depot.

The new producer was David Shanks. Series 11, 12 and 13 saw the return to firefighting scenes as the primary focus. Series 14 was almost completely based on soap opera-style story lines, with the number of fire 'shouts' severely reduced. Viewing figures slumped as the series was critically panned. In 2002 "London's Burning" was cut from the schedule; the final episode was broadcast on 25 August 2002 in a two-hour slot.

In 2000 a 90-minute behind-the-scenes special was released on VHS video.

The "London's Burning" theme used in Series 1‚Äì10 was composed by Simon Brint, Rowland Rivron, and Roddy Matthews. Series 11‚Äì13 used a theme composed by Warren Bennett. The series 14 theme was composed by Stuart Hancock and Toby Jarvis and produced at London-based music production house Mcasso Music. Hancock also composed the original incidental music score to all episodes of series 14.

Series 1‚Äì10 lacked a title sequence. The episodes opened with the text "London's Burning". It was in Futura bold condensed typeface and was superimposed in white over the opening scene of the episode. Series 11‚Äì13 used a montage of action shots superimposed over a fiery background as the text "London's Burning" superimposed in gold and black slowly grew in size over the course of the sequence. It quickly zoomed to fill the screen on the final musical flourish. Series 14 used a shorter montage of action and character shots before the text "london's burning" in orange and white appeared and moved closer together over a shot of fire engines emerging from the station.







The first few series used Dockhead Fire Station at 8 Wolseley Street, London SE1, as the exterior for Blackwall. The Jacob Street studio is opposite. It had a full scale reproduction of the mess, built by Colin Monk. The actual station mess was also used in the series, as were many other parts of the station and its actual firefighters. Dockhead is still an operational fire station but the original station building was demolished and replaced in 2015.

The Swan and Sugar Loaf pub, which featured as the firefighters' local pub, has since been converted to flats. The location is about 800 metres from Tower Bridge.

The Restaurant opened by Mike 'Bayleaf' Wilson in series 9 was filmed on location at The Chequers Inn, Deal, Kent.

Later series used the exterior of Leyton Fire Station and the Oliver Twist pub opposite.

All series of London's Burning were released between 2005 and 2011.

As of 6 January 2019, Drama is re-showing "London's Burning" at one episode per weekday (2.20‚Äì3.20 pm Monday to Friday).

Virgin of the Rocks

The Virgin of the Rocks is a painting by Leonardo da Vinci. It was very controversial and had two versions. The painting shows Mary, John the Baptist, Jesus, and an angel. Mary was holding John the Baptist while Jesus blessed them. The painting was controversial because Mary wasn't touching Jesus at all, so Da Vinci made a second version of the painting. Mary looks very graceful, which was a traditional Renaissance fashion. The French version was the first time that a Renaissance artist did not paint the Virgin Mary with a halo.

Many symbols and emblems in churches and buildings in Lierna lead explorers to discover the important role of the Knights Templar in the region.They also found that Leonardo's painting may have served as a mysterious map to a secret passage in an area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Grigna mountain range known as Alpe di Campione.

The rock formations, caves, waterfalls and breathtaking views of the Grigna massif and the surrounding Lierna mountains on Lake Como inspired Leonardo da Vinci's development.

Peronism

Peronism or justicialism is an Argentine political movement based on the ideas and legacy of Argentine president Juan Per√≥n (1895‚Äì1974). It has been an influential movement in Argentine politics. Since 1946 Peronists have won 10 out of the 13 presidential elections in which they have been allowed to run. The main Peronist party is the Justicialist Party. The ideas of each president were different, but the general ideology has been described as "a vague blend of nationalism and labourism" or populism.

Juan Per√≥n became Argentina's minister of labour after participating in the 1943 military coup and was elected president of Argentina in 1946. He introduced social programs that benefited the working class, supported labor unions, and called for additional involvement of the state in the economy. In addition he helped industrialists. Per√≥n was very popular and gained even more admiration through his wife, Eva, who championed for the rights of migrant workers and was loved by the people. Due to rising inflation and other economic problems, the military overthrew Per√≥n in 1955. The Peronist party was banned and it wasn't until 1973 that open elections were held again. In the 1973 election, Per√≥n was again elected president. He died the next year and his widow, Isabel, took his place as president. Per√≥n's death had led to disunity and the military overthrew Isabel in 1976.

Peronist Carlos Menem was president from 1989 to1999. His policies were very different from previous Peronists, he focused on privatization, free-market policies, and international relations. Peronist N√©stor Kirchner was president from 2003 to 2007, and his wife Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner was president from 2007 to 2015. According to the Economist, the Kirchners returned to "economic nationalism and near-autarky". The ideology of the Kirchners is known as Kirchnerism.

Scratching

Scratching, sometimes referred to as scrubbing, is a DJ and turntablist technique of moving a vinyl record back and forth on a turntable to produce percussive or rhythmic sounds. A crossfader on a DJ mixer may be used to fade between two records simultaneously.

While scratching is most associated with hip hop music, where it emerged in the mid-1970s, from the 1990s it has been used in some styles of rap rock, rap metal and nu metal. In hip hop culture, scratching is one of the measures of a DJ's skills. DJs compete in scratching competitions at the DMC World DJ Championship and IDA (International DJ Association, formerly known as ITF (International Turntablist Federation). At scratching competitions, DJs can use only scratch-oriented gear (turntables, DJ mixer, digital vinyl systems or vinyl records only). In recorded hip hop songs, scratched "hooks" often use portions of other songs.

While scratching is becoming more and more popular in pop music, particularly with the crossover success of pop-hip hop tracks in the 2010s, sophisticated scratching and other expert turntablism techniques are still predominantly an underground style developed by the DJ subculture. The Invisibl Skratch Piklz from San Francisco focuses on scratching. In 1994, the group was formed by DJs Q-Bert, Disk & Shortkut and later Mix Master Mike. In July 2000, San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts held Skratchcon2000, the first DJ Skratch forum that provided ‚Äúthe education and development of skratch music literacy‚Äù. In 2001, Thud Rumble became an independent company that works with DJ artists to produce and distribute scratch records.

In 2004, "Scratch Magazine", one of the first publications about hip hop DJs and record producers, released its debut issue, following in the footsteps of the lesser-known "Tablist" magazine. Pedestrian is a UK arts organisation that runs Urban Music Mentors workshops led by DJs. At these workshops, DJs teach youth how to create beats, use turntables to create mixes, act as an MC at events, and perform club sets.

Scratching has been incorporated into a number of other musical genres, including pop, rock, jazz, some subgenres of heavy metal (notably nu metal) and some contemporary and avant-garde classical music performances. For recording use, samplers are often used instead of physically scratching a vinyl record.

DJ Product¬©1969, formerly of the rap rock band Hed PE, recalled that the punk rock band the Vandals was the first rock band he remembered seeing use turntable scratching. Product¬©1969 also recalled the early rap metal band Proper Grounds, which was signed to Madonna's Maverick Records, as being another one of the first rock bands to utilize scratching in their music.

Guitarist Tom Morello, known for his work with Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave, has performed guitar solos that imitate scratching by using the kill switch on his guitar. Perhaps the best-known example is "Bulls on Parade", in which he creates scratch-like rhythmic sounds by rubbing the strings over the pick-ups while using the pickup selector switch as a crossfader.

Since the 1990s, scratching has been used in a variety of popular music genres such as nu metal, exemplified by Linkin Park, Slipknot and Limp Bizkit. It has also been used by artists in pop music (e.g. Nelly Furtado) and alternative rock (e.g. Incubus). Scratching is also popular in various electronic music styles, such as hard-groove techno.

The Most Mysterious Song on the Internet

The Most Mysterious Song on the Internet is an ongoing internet search. It involves many internet users from around the world trying to find out the artist and the title of a new wave song that played on a German radio station in 1984. 

A Rolling Stone article in September 2019 says that a man named "Darius S." recorded the song from a radio program called "Musik f√ºr junge Leute" ("Music for Young People") he listened to on the German public radio station NDR, probably in 1984. Darius says he recorded the song on a tape labeled "cassette 4", along with songs from XTC and The Cure that were released in around 1984. Further evidence shows that the Technics tape deck that he used to record the song was also made in 1984.

In 2007, Darius' sister, posting under the fake name "Anton," posted the song on the internet to try to find out the artist and the title of the song. The woman, who identified herself as "Lydia H.", posted part of the song to a German fan website devoted to eighties synth-pop and to spiritofradio.ca, a Canadian website that helps to identify songs uploaded by fans.

The mystery of the unidentified song became very popular in 2019 when a Brazilian teenager named Gabriel da Silva Vieira started to look for evidence of its origin. He uploaded a clip of the song to YouTube, and to several Reddit groups.

On July 9, 2019, YouTuber Justin Whang released an episode of his video series "Tales from the Internet". The episode talks about the progress of the search up to then. When the video was released, more internet users tried to help to identify the song. 

After the video came out, some progress was made. The whole song was found and posted by a Reddit user in July 2019. Furthermore, people who might have known the song were contacted. This includes people such as Paul Baskerville, who was the DJ of the show from which the song was likely recorded. He has said he does not remember the song. The Discord community of the search has also found other undocumented and/or obscure media of various genres.

Ritual purification

Ritual purification is the ritual prescribed by a religion by which a person is considered to be free of "uncleanliness". Many religions require that those worshipping should be in this state. Ritual purity is a state of ritual cleanliness. Ritual purification may also apply to objects and places. Ritual uncleanliness is not identical with ordinary physical impurity, such as dirt stains; nevertheless, body fluids are generally considered ritually unclean.

Most of these rituals existed long before the germ theory of disease, and figure prominently from the earliest known religious systems of the Ancient Near East. Some writers connect the rituals to taboos.

Some have seen benefits of these practices for health and preventing infections especially in areas where humans come in close contact with each other. While these practices came before the idea of the germ theory was public in areas that use daily cleaning, the destruction of infectious agents seems to be dramatic. Others have described a 'dimension of purity' that is universal in religions that seeks to move us away from disgust, (at one extreme) and to uplift us towards purity and divinity (at the other extreme). Away from uncleanliness to purity, and away from deviant to moral behavior, (within one's cultural context).


Monolatry

Monolatry ( ["monos"] = single, and ["latreia"] = worship) is belief that many gods exist, but that only one of them is worshipped. The term "monolatry" was perhaps first used by Julius Wellhausen.

Ji≈ô√≠ Kyli√°n

Ji≈ô√≠ Kyli√°n (born 21 March 1947) is a Czech former dancer and contemporary dance choreographer.

Ji≈ô√≠ Kyli√°n was born in 1947 in Prague ‚Äì Czechoslovakia, as one of two sons to his father V√°clav who was a banker and to his mother Mark√©ta, who was as a young teenager a dancer-child prot√©g√©e.

During the years 1962-1967 Kyli√°n studied at the Prague Conservatory. One teacher of the Conservatory, who left a deep mark on Kyli√°n¬¥s professional development, was Zora ≈†emberov√°, known for her world¬¥s first interpretation of Juliet (1938) in Prokofiev‚Äôs famous ballet.
In 1967 Kyli√°n had received a scholarship to study at the "Royal Ballet School" in London,

He met John Cranko, choreographer, there, who offered him a contract, to become a member of his acclaimed "Stuttgart Ballett". Before taking up his contract, Kyli√°n shortly returned to Prague, but on August 21st, 1968, the invasion of the communist "Warsaw-Pact " forces began. On the 28th of August, after taking part in many demonstrations against the occupation, Kyli√°n left for Germany.

In Stuttgart Cranko asked Kyli√°n to create choreographies for the company. His first work was "Kommen und Gehen", created with Marcia Hayd√©e and Richard Cragun. In the early 70‚Äôs Cranko invited Glen Tetley to become resident choreographer in Stuttgart. Tetley¬¥s work made a great impression on Kyli√°n, namely Tetley‚Äôs understanding of movement, and its relation to space, was a revelation for Kyli√°n.

In early seventies, Kyli√°n was invited to create his first choreography for the Netherlands Dance Theatre ("Viewers-1973"). Having created two more works for NDT ("Stoolgame" 1974 and "La Cath√©drale Engloutie" 1975) the offer to become artistic director of NDT together with Hans Knill, was extented to him.

The creation of "Sinfonietta", to music of Kylian¬¥s co-patriot Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek for the "Charleston Festival" in the USA in 1978 led to international recognition of the company. Subsequently many important international tours of NDT have taken place incl. Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the Paris Opera etc.

During Kyli√°ns engagement in NDT (1975-2009), he has created more than 75 choreographies for the company. Further pieces he made for other worldwide companies, such as the Stuttgart Ballet, the Op√©ra de Paris, the Munich Bayerisches Staatsballett, and the Tokyo Ballet.

Realizing the importance of education of young dancers, Ji≈ô√≠ Kyli√°n and Carel Birnie, the managing director of NDT, have decided in 1978 to create a new company - NDT II, in which young people would get the opportunity to develop their skills and talents. After many years of directorship, Kyli√°n saw the departure of many fine and interesting performers. It was in 1991 that he decided to create a small group for dancers, who find themselves in the precarious age between "forty and death". The world premiere of this ‚ÄúSenior Company‚Äù was created by choreographers: Hans van Manen, Mats Ek, William Forsythe and Ji≈ô√≠ Kyli√°n. The original dancers were: Sabine Kupferberg, Alida Chase, G√©rard Lemaitre and Niklas Ek. The importance of this new development in dance was instantly recognized by the public as well as by the media.

This unique, three-dimensional structure, NDT I ‚Äì mature dancers, NDT II ‚Äì young dancers, NDT III ‚Äì senior dancers, residing in its own theater, designed and built by architect Rem Koolhaas in 1987, placed NDT in a totally new category. It has become different from any other dance company in the world, and was recognized as such by being given various prestigious awards.

In the recent years Kyli√°n‚Äôs creativity is focused on film, video and photography. The films ‚ÄúCarmen‚Äù, ‚ÄúSchwarzfahrer‚Äù, ‚ÄúBetween Entrance and Exit‚Äù, ‚ÄúScalamare‚Äù and the photo installation ‚ÄúFree fall‚Äù were all created in collaboration with his lifelong partner and muse Sabine Kupferberg.

In 1988 Kyli√°n established the Kylian Foundation in The Hague (originally named as ‚ÄúKyli√°n Choreographic Archive‚Äù). In 2008 the Kylian Production BV was set up in the Netherlands and in 2017 Kyli√°n Fund Prague was founded in the Czech Republic.

Theatre works from 1973 to 2019:
During his career, Kylian has received many prestigeous, international awards and honours, such as:

Data Discman

The Data Discman is an device that plays electronic books. It was made by Sony Corporation, which was the parent company of Sony Pictures Entertainment. It came out in the Western market in late 1991 or early 1992. It was marketed in the United States to college students and international travelers, but was only successful in Japan. The Discman product name was first used for Sony's range of portable CD players, such as the Sony Discman D-50, which first came out in 1984.

The Data Discman allows information to be accessed quickly on a pre-recorded disc. This is done using a QWERTY keyboard and the "Yes" and "No" keys.

Most Data Discman models have a small low-resolution grayscale LCD (256x200 at first, then up to 320x240 and in colour for later models), a CD drive (either Mini CD or full size), and a computer that is not very powerful. Early versions of the device cannot play audio CDs. Software is pre-recorded and mostly is encyclopedias, foreign language dictionaries and novels. Software was usually made using the Sony Electronic Book Authoring System.

A DD-1EX Data Discman is in the permanent collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. It is displayed in the V&A's 20th Century Gallery. This early model cannot play sound.

An updated model, the DD-10EX, came out in 1992 or 1993. The manual that comes with it gives a copyright date of 1992. Unlike the DD-1EX, the DD-10EX can also play audio files. The British version comes with two discs: one with the "Thomson Electronic Directory" for April 1992 on it, and one with the "Pocket Interpreter 5-language conversation book for travelers" on it. A DD-10EX was in an exhibition called "The Book and Beyond: Electronic Publishing and the Art of the Book", which was held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, from April 1995 to October 1995. The exhibition also included a CD-ROM for the Data Discman, which is called "The Library of the Future", and came out in 1993.

The DD-1EX and DD-10EX were both in a flip or clamshell design, while the flat, rectangular design of the DD-8 was closer to later e-book readers, such as the Amazon Kindle.

Le Courrier

Le Courrier is a French-language daily newspaper, which originated in Geneva. It was first issued as a Sunday newspaper, on January 5, 1868. Most people in Geneva are Protestant. Le Courrier was issues by a small number of Catholics. It has always had a strong focus on Catholic values. In 1892, it became a daily newspaper. In 1907, Geneva had a separation of Church and state; at that time, the number of printed copied dropped markedly.

Until 1923, the newspaper was Christian and stood for conservative values. In that year Christan Levraz changed the focus to focus more on social values - The newspaper was left-wing, from then on. The Catholic Church was not too happy with the left-wing orientation of the newspaper. In 1996, the Church stopped supporting Le Courrier, because it saw the journal's attitude as too close to the Biblical teachings (that is: too evangelical). Today, the newspaper collaborates with La Libert√©, another Catholic newspaper from Fribourg. In the year 2019, 7.000-8.000 copies were printed each day.

U.S. Route 101

U.S. Route 101, or U.S. Highway 101, (US¬†101) is a north‚Äìsouth United States Numbered Highway that goes along the West Coast of the United States. It goes through the states of California, Oregon, and Washington. It goes alongside, and often joins onto, California State Route 1 when going through California. Unlike most other 3 digit routes in the system which are treated as spurs of their two digit parent routes, US 101 is treated as a two digit Route with a first digit of "10". The reason for this was that if the west coast highway was numbered US 91, there would be no room to establish US 93, US 95, US 97, and US 99, all of which must be west of US 91. So, they decided to call the west coast highway US 101 instead. The '10' could have been underlined so that people think that this route is a two digit route rather than a spur route of US 1, the US Highway on the east coast.

The route starts in Los Angeles at the junction of the Interstate 5, Interstate 10, and California State Route 60. It goes west past the north side of Downtown Los Angeles towards the coast. It meets the coast near Oxnard and goes north along the coast from here. The main cities it passes through in California is Santa Maria, San Jose, San Francisco, Santa Rosa, and Eureka, California. In San Francisco, the route goes over the Golden Gate Bridge. The main cities the route passes in Oregon is North Bend, Florence, Newport, and Astoria. These cities are small, as no large cities are on Oregon's coast. It runs near to the Interstate 5, which goes through larger cities like Salem and Portland. In Washington, the main cities it passes through is Aberdeen, Forks and Port Angeles. It ends at the Interstate 5 in Olympia. The route is about in total.

The route used to be the main highway along the West Coast, but now most people use the Interstate 5 to go along the coast. The US 101 used to go south to San Diego, but the part of the US 101 between here and Los Angeles was totally replaced by the I-5 in the 1960s. When it first opened, the US 101 used small roads that had already been built. In 1933, a new highway with bridges and ramps was built so it was faster for people to use.

Central Siberian Yupik language

Central Siberian Yupik is one of four existing Yupik languages. It is also known as Siberian Yupik, Bering Strait Yupik, Yuit, Yoit, "St. Lawrence Island Yupik", and in Russia "Chaplinski Yupik" or Yuk. It is spoken by the Yupik people in Siberia, and in two villages on St. Lawrence Island. It is an endangered language: Of the 1,200 residents of St. Lawrence Islands, fewer than 1,000 speak the language. On the Siberian mainland, about 200 of the 1,200 ethnic Yupik speak the language. The second most common Yupik language in Siberia is Naukan Yupik, with about 70 speakers.

There are two dialects: Chaplino Yupik is mainly spoken on the Chukchi Peninsula, Siberia, and St. Lawrence Island Yupik. The differences between the two dialects are small.

Ace Books

Ace Books is an American specialty publisher of science fiction and fantasy books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by Aaron A. Wyn and began as a genre publisher of mysteries and westerns. It soon tried other genres. Ace published its first science fiction (SF) book in 1953. This was successful, and Ace soon published more science fiction books than both mysteries and westerns. Ace became known for the "t√™te-b√™che" publishing format used for many of its early books. But, it did not invent the format. Most of the early books were published in this "Ace Double" format, and Ace continued to publish books in several genres, in "t√™te-b√™che" format, until 1973.

Ace, along with Ballantine Books, was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years. The death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967 created problems for the publisher. That was delayed several years by the Ace Science Fiction Specials series, prominent in science fiction awards and nominations for novels published from 1968 to 1970. Two leading editors, Donald A. Wollheim and Terry Carr, left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to Grosset & Dunlap. Despite financial troubles, there were more successes, particularly with the third Ace Science Fiction Specials series, for which Carr came back as editor. Several sales of the company resulted in the company becoming part of Berkley Books. Ace later became an imprint of Penguin Group (USA).

Editor Donald A. Wollheim was working at Avon Books in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade A. A. Wyn to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and pulp magazines under the name A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers. His magazines included "Ace Mystery" and "Ace Sports." Ace Books may have got its name from these magazines. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but waited for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at Pyramid Books. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound "t√™te-b√™che": Keith Vining's "Too Hot for Hell", backed with Samuel W. Taylor's "The Grinning Gismo," for 35 cents, with serial number D-01. A "t√™te-b√™che" book has the two titles bound in opposite directions, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). Ace did not invent this format even though they are well-known for it. Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, so that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the "Ace Double" format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag "Complete and Unabridged" on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features William S. Burroughs's first novel, "Junkie" (written under the pseudonym "William Lee"), and many novels by Philip K. Dick, Robert Bloch, Harlan Ellison, Harry Whittington, and Louis L'Amour, including those written under his pseudonym "Jim Mayo".

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's "Life with Lancelot", backed with William Barton's "Hunting on Kunderer", issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace started using the "Ace Double" name again in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally, not "t√™te-b√™che".

Ace's second title was a western (also "t√™te-b√™che"): William Colt MacDonald's "Bad Man's Return", bound with J. Edward Leithead's "Bloody Hoofs". Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as P. G. Wodehouse's "Quick Service", bound with his "The Code of the Woosters". In 1953, A.E. van Vogt's "The World of Null-A", bound with his "The Universe Maker", appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released Theodore S. Drachman's "Cry Plague!", with a plot that could be regarded as SF, but the book it was bound with‚ÄîLeslie Edgley's "The Judas Goat"‚Äîwas not SF.) Another SF double followed later in 1953, and SF quickly became an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more SF books each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, SF titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published some juvenile delinquent novels in the 1950s. Collectors want these books, such as D-343, "The Young Wolves" by Edward De Roo and D-378, "Out for Kicks" by Wilene Shaw.

By the late 1950s, Ace's was publishing almost one hundred titles a year. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents. A few were 50 cents. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of Frank Herbert's "Dune", were priced at 95 cents. With Ballantine Books, Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their example and sold books to the increasing audience for SF. But, no other publisher had as much the influence as Ace or Ballantine.

Market dominance was not only how many books Ace published, but also the first novels of authors such as Philip K. Dick ("Solar Lottery", 1955, D-103, bound with Leigh Brackett's "The Big Jump"); Gordon R. Dickson ("Alien from Arcturus", 1956, D-139, bound with Nick Boddie Williams' "The Atom Curtain"), Samuel R. Delany ("The Jewels of Aptor", 1962, F-173, bound with James White's "Second Ending"), Ursula K. Le Guin ("Rocannon's World", 1966, G-574, bound with Avram Davidson's "The Kar-Chee Reign"), Roger Zelazny ("This Immortal", 1966, F-393),
and R. A. Lafferty's "Past Master" (1968, H-54).

In 1964, science fiction author Terry Carr joined the company. In 1967, he started the Ace Science Fiction Specials line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as R. A. Lafferty, Joanna Russ and Ursula K. Le Guin. Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual "Year's Best Science Fiction" anthology series; and Carr also edited "Universe", a well-received original anthology series. "Universe" was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a copyright loophole in the American edition of "The Lord of the Rings" by J. R. R. Tolkien. The Houghton Mifflin edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the George Allen & Unwin edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by Jack Gaughan. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by Ballantine Books (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any "unauthorized" versions ‚Äì referring directly to the Ace editions), Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.

Wyn died in 1967, and the company grew larger than its budget. It did not pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim did not want to send signed contracts to authors. At least once, a book without a contract went to the printer. Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, had to picking fruit for a living.

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim planned to start a separate paperback house with New American Library. He set up DAW Books. Carr became a freelance editor. Both Carr and Wollheim then edited competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, Charter Communications. It was in the Hippodrome Building, 1120 Avenue of the Americas, in New York City. In 1972, Grosset & Dunlap bought Ace, and in 1982, Grosset & Dunlap was bought by G.P. Putnam's Sons. Ace was likely the only profitable part of Grosset & Dunlap by this time. Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a freelance editor, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, William Gibson's "Neuromancer", Kim Stanley Robinson's "The Wild Shore", Lucius Shepard's "Green Eyes", and Michael Swanwick's "In the Drift". All were first novels by authors now regarded as major figures in the SF genre. Other prominent SF publishing figures who have worked at Ace include Tom Doherty, who left to start Tor Books, and Jim Baen, who left to work at Tor and who eventually founded Baen Books. Writers who have worked at Ace include Frederik Pohl and Ellen Kushner.

In 1996, Penguin Group (USA) bought the Putnam Berkley Group, and kept Ace as its SF imprint. As of December 2012, recently published authors included Joe Haldeman, Charles Stross, Laurell K. Hamilton, Alastair Reynolds, and Jack McDevitt. Penguin joined together with Random House in 2013 to become Penguin Random House, which continues to own Berkley. Ace's editorial team is also responsible for the Roc Books imprint, although the two imprints have a separate brand identity.

These people have worked at Ace Books as editors. The list is in order by the date they started working at Ace, if that is known. It includes editors who are notable and the most recent editors at Ace.

Until the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as "D-31" and "H-77", and numbers, such as "10293" and "15697". The letters told the price. This is a list of letter series with their dates and prices.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in "t√™te-b√™che" format: Keith Vining's "Too Hot for Hell" backed with Samuel W. Taylor's "The Grinning Gismo". That series continued until D-599, Patricia Libby's "Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry", but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate "Double" (i.e., "t√™te-b√™che") or "Single"; there are D-series titles that are not "t√™te-b√™che", although none of the "t√™te-b√™che" titles have an S serial number. Towards the end of this initial series, the F series began (at a new price), and thereafter there were always several different letter series in publication simultaneously. The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101. The "t√™te-b√™che" format proved attractive to book collectors, and some rare titles in mint condition command prices over $1,000.

Fantastic Science Fiction

Fantastic was an American digest-size fantasy and science fiction magazine. It was published from 1952 to 1980. Ziff Davis started it as a fantasy companion to "Amazing Stories". Within a few years sales went down. Howard Browne, the editor, was forced to switch to science fiction not fantasy. Browne lost interest in the magazine. The magazine often published poor-quality fiction in the mid-1950s, under Browne and his successor, Paul W. Fairman. At the end of the 1950s, Cele Goldsmith took over as editor of both "Fantastic" and "Amazing Stories". Goldsmith helped to support the early careers of writers such as Roger Zelazny and Ursula K. Le Guin. In 1965 the magazines were sold to Sol Cohen, who hired Joseph Wrzos as editor and switched to a reprint-only policy. This was financially successful, but brought Cohen into conflict with the newly formed Science Fiction Writers of America. At the end of the 1960s, Ted White became editor and the reprints were stopped.

White worked hard to make the magazine successful, introducing artwork from comics artistsBut, in 1978, Cohen sold out his half of the business to his partner, Arthur Bernhard. White resigned soon after. Elinor Mavor was the next editor, but within two years Bernhard decided to close down "Fantastic". He combined it with "Amazing Stories", which had always enjoyed a slightly higher circulation.

Melikdom of Kashatag

Melikdom of Kashatag (also Kyshtag; arm. ’î’°’∑’°’©’°’≤’´ ’¥’•’¨’´÷Ñ’∏÷Ç’©’µ’∏÷Ç’∂) - Armenian melikdom (princedom), which existed in the 15th-17th century. It was located along the Akera River, on the southeastern section of the modern border of Armenia and Azerbaijan (near the Kashatag region of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic). The residence of the Meliks was located in the village of Khnats, in the east of the present Syunik region of Armenia.

Melikdom was founded in the last quarter of the 15th century. Melik Haykaz I, the founder of the Melik-Haykazyan dynasty, the youngest branch of the Armenian princely dynasty of Proshyan, became its founder. Prior to the Aikazyan, the Kashatag region was ruled by the clan of Shahurnetsi and before them by the Orbelian family.
Aikaz I was succeeded by a son, Ahnazar I. Ahnazar died in 1551, his grave survived until the 1930s. The palace of Akhnazar in Khnatsakh has survived to this day.
The most prominent representative of the genus was Melik Aikaz II, who owned Melik rights from 1551 to 1623 and was an active supporter of the Iranian orientation during the Turkish-Persian wars for the possession of Transcaucasia. Arakel of Tabriz mentions him as one of the noble Armenians and advisers at the court of Shah of Iran Abbas I.
According to historian M. Asratyan, due to the brutal policies of the Ottoman Empire during the temporary occupation of Transcaucasia, in the 1580s or 90s, Aykaz II left his possessions and lived in exile in Iran for 10-15 years. After the reconquest of the region by Iran and the crowding out of Turkish troops, in 1606-1607, as one of the loyal supporters of the Shah, Aykaz II was not only restored to his rights to Kashatag but also received some possessions beyond its borders.
We have reached the decree(ferman) of Shah Abbas I with a listing of the services provided by Melik for Shah authorities. The decree(ferman) himself has no date, but the date 999 of the hijra (that is, 1590/1591) is indicated on the seal of Abbas I.
The names of Aikaz I, Ahnazar I, Aikaz II and their descendants are found in tombstones preserved on gravestones of the 16th ‚Äì 18th centuries.
On behalf of Melikdom of Kashatag, which were belonged to the Aykazyan family, a document written in Persian in 1691-92 was preserved. It includes the joint appeal of Melik Akhnazar and his subordinate village headmen(in Armenian "tanuter", in Persian "kedhuda"), addressed to the Shah‚Äôs court. In the document, they appoint as their authorized representatives the son of melik Akhnazar, Ilyas (Elias), and one of the elders, Hikor, who were supposed to present the problems arising in the region to the Shah‚Äôs court and defend the interests of the local population.
The names of Melik Ahnazar and his brother Aikaz (who is also mentioned in the document of 1691/92 as one of the witnesses) are marked in the inscription of 1682 on the facade of the entrance to the Church of the Holy Virgin in the village of Mirik of the Kashatag region.

28 Fundamental Beliefs

The 28 fundamental beliefs are the core beliefs of Seventh-day Adventist theology. Adventists are opposed to the formulation of creeds, so the 28 fundamental beliefs are considered "descriptors", not "prescriptors"; that is, that they describe the official position of the church but are not criteria for membership. These beliefs were originally known as the 27 fundamental beliefs when adopted by the church's General Conference in 1999 additional belief (number 11) was added in 2005. The "Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary" is a way to say Adventist theological thought.

They might be grouped into: God, humanity, salvation, the church, Christian life, and the restoration.

There is seven distinct Adventist SDA pillars of doctrine that are inside the 28 Fundamental Beliefs which can be found in the article "Landmarks" in The Seventh-day Adventist Encyclopedia (vol. 10, pp.¬†682, 683). Though similar reference
does not appear under other intuitive headings such as Pillars, Waymarks, Special Points,b Foundations, Pegs, Pins, or Platforms, all these terms are roughly synonymous with Landmarks. In Comprehensive Index to the Writings of Ellen G. White, vol. 2, the entry for Pillar(s) on p.¬†2061 is cross-referenced to Landmark, the only term among the eight named here with a corresponding entry in the Encyclopedia.

Ellen White wrote on these landmarks or pillars, "Let the truths that are the foundation of our faith be kept before the people. Some will depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. They talk science, and the enemy comes in and gives them an abundance of science; but it is not the science of salvation. It is not the science of humility, of consecration, or of the sanctification of the spirit. We are now to understand what the pillars of our faith are,-- the truths that have made us as a people what we are, leading us on step by step." (Review and Herald, May 25, 1905)

In her book Counsels to Writers and Editors, White was more descriptive. "The passing of the time in 1844 was a period of great events, opening to our astonished eyes the cleansing of the sanctuary transpiring in heaven, and having decided relation to God‚Äôs people upon the earth, [also] the first and second angels‚Äô messages and the third, unfurling the banner on which was inscribed, ‚ÄúThe commandments of God and the faith of Jesus [including Righteousness by Faith].‚Äù One of the landmarks under this message was the temple of God, seen by His truth-loving people in heaven, and the ark containing the law of God. The light of the Sabbath of the fourth commandment flashed its strong rays in the pathway of the transgressors of God‚Äôs law. The nonimmortality of the wicked is an old landmark".

These foundations, pillars, and landmarks are:

The foundation of Seventh-Day Adventism was being set between 1840 and 1844 and led to many of these landmarks being spread among the early believers. Seventh-Day Adventists believe they are repeating the history of the Jewish nation at Christ's first Advent. The Jews strayed so far from true doctrine that they did not recognize Him who was the very foundation of their system of worship. Their error and tradition led them to reject Christ and close their probation on the wrong side of the Great Controversy. Spiritual Israel is in a similar position now at the end of the world with many Protestant denominations drifting and forgetting the truths which they were built on. These early Adventists came to understand present truth and the Pillars prepare the church to stand through the coming end times and perform the work of restoring the true foundation given from scripture.

Norwegian heavy water sabotage

The Norwegian heavy water sabotage was a group of Allied missions in World War II. The target of the missions was the 60 megawatt Vemork power station. This power station produced a type of water that is named heavy water. Heavy water is based on a hydrogen isotope called deuterium. The missions were to stop Germany from making heavy water. Germany needed the heavy water to understand and help make atomic bombs. The attacks started in February 1942 by Norwegian Commandos and Allied bombers. The missions were code named Grouse, Freshman, and Gunnerside. The missions were successful and the Vemork power plant was no longer working by 1943.

British Special Operations Executive (or SOE) made plans to put four Norwegian commandos in the area in October 1942. On 19 October 1942, these Norwegian commandos parachuted in. They had to ski a very long way to get to the station. They were supposed to watch the power station to make sure it was safe for other troops to arrive. The mission went well and the commandos began surveillance of the power station from Hardanger Plateau.

On 19 November 1942, British paratroopers were supposed to meet the Norwegian commandos and attack the power station. The paratroopers were flown in on gliders pulled by large bombers. The gliders and bombers crashed before they got to Vemork. Most of the British paratroopers were killed in the crash. One crew from a bomber survived, but they were all captured by the German army. The German Gestapo then tortured and executed all of the prisoners. Even though the Norwegian commandos were able to hide from the Germans, the mission was a complete failure.

A new mission was started in February 1943. This time, the Norwegian commandos were able to sneak up to the power station and attacked it. The commandos set bombs on the machines that made the heavy water. The commandos left a Thompson submachine gun behind on purpose so the German military would know it wasn't people from the town. The bombs destroyed the machines and stopped the station from making heavy water. No one from the ferry survived and the heavy water was lost. All of the commandos survived.

After the station was damaged, the German soldiers tried to move the heavy water they had made. The German army moved the remaining heavy water to a dock on Lake Tinn. The heavy water was in drums that were loaded on a railroad car. They loaded the railroad cars on a ferry called the "SF Hydro". Norwegian resistance fighters, led by one of the commandos from Operation Gunnerside, were able to plant bombs on the ferry. After the ferry left the dock, the bombs exploded and the ferry sank into deep water. 18 people died on the ferry, 14 Norwegians and 4 German soldiers.

Early Christian councils

The early councils of Christian churches often set the theological boundaries of what came to be considered statements of Christian belief. The first council was in Jerusalem in 49AD. The issue which led to the meeting was the result of the work of Paul, leading people to faith in Jesus and planting churches in Asia Minor. Paul wanted the new believers and their churches to be accepted by the original church in Jerusalem and to be known in faith and fellowship as true churches. After discussion, Peter concluded that the churches and their faith should be recognized as being on equal with the believer in Jerusalem. James concluded the same and the church issued a letter affirming the same faith in both sets of churches. The letter is found in the book of Acts 15:23-29. The affirmation was to accept their biblical faith, as reported by Paul and Barnabas, and to ask them to not offend their brothers in Jerusalem.

In the history of Christianity in the West (Roman empire) there were seven ecumenical councils include the following: the First Council of Nicaea in 325, the First Council of Constantinople in 381, the Council of Ephesus in 431, the Council of Chalcedon in 451. The near Eastern churches attend the first three councils. The African and far eastern orthodox churches did not attend after Nicaea.

Galia melon

The Galia melon, also known as sarda in Southeast Asia, is hybrid melon. It comes from a cross between the green-flesh melon cultivar 'Ha-Ogen' and the netted-rind melon cultivar 'Krimka'. It was developed in Israel at the Ne¬¥ve Yaar Research Center of the Agricultural Research Organisation by Dr. Zvi Karchi. It was released in 1973, and named after Karchi's daughter, whose name means "God's wave" in Hebrew.The Galia melon can look like a cantaloupe the outside and a honeydew inside.

Galia melons have the following characteristics:

Ripeness is measured by color of the skin, when it starts turning from green to yellow. After cutting, uneaten pieces should be wrapped and refrigerated to keep flavor.

They are not difficult to grow. Galias are now grown in Algeria, Brazil, Guatemala, Portugal, Spain, Morocco, Southern US regions, Costa Rica, Panama, Honduras, Greece, Turkey, Israel, and Egypt.

Polymorphism (materials science)

In materials science, polymorphism is the ability of a solid material to exist in more than one form or crystal structure. Polymorphism can be found in any crystalline material including polymers, minerals, and metals. It is related to allotropy, which refers to chemical elements. The complete morphology of a material is described by polymorphism and other variables such as crystal habit, amorphous fraction or crystallographic defects. Polymorphism is important in fields such as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, pigments, dyes, foods, and explosives.

Polimorphism that exists because of a difference in crystal packing is called packing polymorphism. Polymorphism can also result from the existence of different conformers of the same molecule in conformational polymorphism. In pseudopolymorphism the different crystal types are the result of hydration or solvation. This is more correctly referred to as solvomorphism as different solvates have different chemical formulas. An example of an organic polymorph is glycine, which is able to form monoclinic and hexagonal crystals. Silica is known to form many polymorphs, the most important of which are; Œ±-quartz, Œ≤-quartz, tridymite, cristobalite, moganite, coesite, and stishovite. A classical example is the pair of minerals, calcite and aragonite, both forms of calcium carbonate.

An analogous phenomenon for amorphous materials is polyamorphism, when a substance can take on several different amorphous modifications.

Apatheism

Apatheism (; a portmanteau of "apathy" and "theism") is the attitude of apathy towards the existence or non-existence of God(s). It is more of an attitude rather than a belief, claim, or belief system.

An apatheist is someone who is not interested in accepting or rejecting any claims that gods exist or do not exist. The existence of God(s) is not rejected, but may be designated irrelevant.

Scientist and philosopher Ian von Hegner has argued that apatheism is an alternative to positions such as theism, atheism, and agnosticism, with implications that have been overlooked in modern philosophical discussions. Philosopher Trevor Hedberg has called apatheism "uncharted territory in the philosophy of religion."

Theological noncognitivism

Theological noncognitivism is the position that religious language ‚Äì¬†specifically, words such as "God"¬†‚Äì and "Allah"¬†‚Äì are not coherently defined. It is sometimes considered synonymous with ignosticism and igtheism.

One argument holds to the claim that definitions of "God" and "Allah" are irreducible, self-instituting relational, circular. For example, a sentence stating that "God is He who created everything, apart from Himself", is seen as circular rather than an irreducible truth.

Transfinite number

In mathematics, transfinite numbers are numbers that are "infinite" in the sense that they are larger than all finite numbers, but not necessarily absolutely infinite. These numbers can be categorized into two types: transfinite cardinals and transfinite ordinals.

Transfinite cardinals are infinite numbers used to quantify the different sizes of infinity‚Äîof which there are many kinds. For example, the number formula_1 (aleph null) is used to refer to the size of the set of natural numbers (or other sets having the same size as the natural numbers). Other such numbers include formula_2 (aleph one) and formula_3. These are called aleph numbers.

Under continuum hypothesis, the number formula_2 is the same as the size of the set of real numbers. This number is sometimes referred to as formula_5 (or the cardinality of the continuum).

Aside from transfinite cardinals, transfinite ordinals also exist. These are numbers used to describe the ordering of sets. For example, the ordinal number formula_6 is the set of all finite ordinals. It is also the first transfinite ordinal.

Haakon VII

Haakon VII (, born Prince Carl of Denmark; 3 August 1872 ‚Äî 21 September 1957) was the King of Norway from 1905 until his death in 1957.

Originally born a Danish prince, he was the son of the future King Frederick VIII of Denmark and Louise of Sweden. Prince Carl was educated at the Royal Danish Naval Academy and served in the Royal Danish Navy. After the 1905 dissolution of the union between Sweden and Norway, Prince Carl had an opportunity to take the Norwegian crown. Following the November plebiscite, Haakon accepted the opportunity and was proclaimed king on 18 November 1905. He took the Old Norse name "Haakon", becoming the first independent Norwegian monarch to use that name since 1380.

As king, Haakon gained much sympathy from the Norwegian people. Although the Constitution of Norway vests the King with considerable executive powers, in practice Haakon confined himself to a representative and ceremonial role while rarely interfering in politics, a practice continued by his son and grandson.

Norway was invaded by Nazi Germany in April 1940. Haakon rejected German demands to legitimise the Quisling regime's puppet government, vowing to abdicate rather than do so. He refused to abdicate after going into exile in Great Britain. As such, he played a pivotal role in uniting the Norwegian nation in its resistance to the invasion and the subsequent five-year-long occupation during the Second World War. He returned to Norway in June 1945 after the defeat of Germany.

He became the King of Norway when his grandfather, Christian IX was still the King of Denmark, and that before his father and elder brother became kings of Denmark. During his reign he saw his father Frederick VIII, his elder brother Christian X, and his nephew Frederick IX ascend the throne of Denmark, in 1906, 1912 (also of Iceland from 1918 to 1944), and 1947 respectively. Haakon died on 21 September 1957 at the age of 85 after a long 52-year reign. He was succeeded by his only son, Olav, who ascended to the throne as Olav V.

Haakon has a reputation as one Norway's greatest kings. Despite living in exile for five years, he refused to abdicate the throne. He played a pivotal role in uniting the Norwegian nation in its resistance to the invasion and the subsequent five-year-long occupation. He also managed to hold his young and fragile country together in unstable political conditions.

Haakon VII reigned during two world wars. His refusal to submit when a German-pressured Storting body asked him to abdicate inspired the Norwegians to resist the German occupation during World War II. Haakon VII returned from exile in England to Norway in June 1945.

Haakon VII died on September 21, 1957 in the Royal Palace in Oslo.

Cromwellian conquest of Ireland

During the wars of the kingdoms, forces of the English parliament conquered Ireland, between 1649 and 1653. These forces were led by Oliver Cromwell. The event is known as Cromwellian conquest of Ireland or Cromwellian war in Ireland. Cromwell invaded Ireland with his New Model Army on behalf of England's Rump Parliament in August 1649.

After the Irish Rebellion of 1641, most of Ireland came under the control of the Irish Catholic Confederation. In early 1649, the Confederates allied with the English Royalists, who had been defeated by the Parliamentarians in the English Civil War. By May 1652, Cromwell's Parliamentarian army had defeated the Confederate and Royalist coalition in Ireland and occupied the country, ending the Irish Confederate Wars (or Eleven Years' War). However, guerrilla warfare continued for a further year. Cromwell passed a series of Penal Laws against Roman Catholics (the vast majority of the population) and confiscated large amounts of their land.

The Parliamentarian conquest was brutal, and Cromwell is still a hated figure in Ireland. The extent to which Cromwell, who was in direct command for the first year of the campaign, was responsible for the atrocities is debated to this day. Some historians argue that the actions of Cromwell were within the then-accepted rules of war, or were exaggerated or distorted by later propagandists; these claims have been challenged by others.

The impact of the war on the Irish population was unquestionably severe, although there is no consensus as to the magnitude of the loss of life. The war resulted in famine, which was worsened by an outbreak of bubonic plague. Estimates of the drop in the Irish population resulting from the Parliamentarian campaign range from 15 to 41 percent. The Parliamentarians also transported about 50,000 people as indentured labourers. Some estimates cover population losses over the course of the Conquest Period (1649‚Äì52) only, while others cover the period of the Conquest to 1653 and the period of the Cromwellian Settlement from August 1652 to 1659 together.

Kingdom of Aksum

The Kingdom of Aksum (), also known as the Kingdom of Axum or the Aksumite Empire, was an ancient kingdom centered in what is now Eritrea and the Tigray Region of northern Ethiopia. Axumite Emperors were powerful sovereigns, styling themselves King of kings, king of Aksum, Himyar, Raydan, Saba, Salhen, Tsiyamo, Beja and of Kush.
Ruled by the Aksumites, it existed from approximately 80 BC to AD 825. It was centered in the city of Axum and grew from the proto-Aksumite Iron Age period around the 4th century BC. It became important by the 1st century AD. 
Aksum became a major player on the commercial route between the Roman Empire and Ancient India. The Aksumite rulers made trade easier by minting their own Aksumite currency. The state also assumed its hegemony over the declining Kingdom of Kush. It also regularly entered the politics of the kingdoms on the Arabian Peninsula and eventually extended its rule over the region with the conquest of the Himyarite Kingdom. The Manichaei prophet Mani (died 274 AD) regarded Axum as one of the four great powers of his time; the others were Persia, Rome, and China. 

The Aksumites built monumental stelae, which served a religious purpose in pre-Christian times. One of these granite columns is the largest such structure in the world, at 90 feet. Under Ezana (fl. 320‚Äì360) Aksum adopted Christianity. In the 7th century, early Muslims from Mecca sought refuge from Quraysh persecution by travelling to the kingdom, a journey known in Islamic history as the First Hijra.

The kingdom's ancient capital, also called Axum, is now a town in Tigray Region (northern Ethiopia). The Kingdom used the name "Ethiopia" as early as the 4th century. Tradition claims Axum as the alleged resting place of the Ark of the Covenant and the purported home of the Queen of Sheba.

2020 Irish general election

The 2020 Irish general election took place on Saturday, 8 February 2020. This was the first election since 1918 to be held on a weekend instead of a weekday.

The election resulted in a hung parliament, with the three largest parties splitting the vote nearly evenly.

Fianna F√°il secured the most seats, with 38, then returning and unopposed Ceann Comhairle giving them a 1-seat advantage. Sinn F√©in finished with the most first-preference votes of any party and 37 seats to obtain the party's best showing since the foundation of the modern Republic of Ireland. Fine Gael, the party of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, finished third in both number of seats (35) and first-preference votes.

Since a coalition needs the support of 80 or more TDs in the 160-seat D√°il and no two parties have that many seats between them, any coalition would require the support of smaller parties or independent TDs to govern.

The chart below shows the results of opinion polls since the previous general election.

Persian Gulf naming dispute

The Persian Gulf naming dispute is about the name of the body of water known historically and internationally as the Persian Gulf (), after the land of Persia (the old Name of Iran.
some Arab countries since the 1960s started to call it Arabian Gulf 
This name has changed by some Arab countries since the 1960s, there was no act until the early 1960s does a major new development occur with the adoption by the Arab states bordering on the Gulf of the new expression "al-Khalƒ´j al- ªArabƒ´" as a weapon against Iran for political influence in the Gulf.
On almost all maps printed before 1960, and in most modern international treaties, documents and maps, this body of water is known by the name "Persian Gulf 
This reflects traditional usage since the Greek geographers Strabo and Ptolemy, and the geopolitical realities of the time with a powerful Persian Empire comprising the whole northern coastline and a scattering of local emirates on the Arabian coast. It was referred to as the Persian Gulf by all Arabs historian and Geoghraphers such as the Arabic Christian writer Agapius, writing in the 10th century.

According to the book Documents on the Persian Gulf's name (pp 92‚Äì98), the United Nations Secretariat and its specialized agencies have requested its staff to use only "Persian Gulf" as a standard geographical name.

The United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names discussed the naming issue during its 23rd session, held in Vienna from 28 March to 4 April 2006. According to the report of the meeting, "It is interesting that from among 6000 existing historical maps published up to 1890, there are only three maps mentioning the names of Basreh Gulf, Qatif Gulf, and Arabic Gulf, in addition to which the name of small gulfs(Bay) located at the coast with local use can be also named such as Siraf Gulf(bay), Basreh Gulf, Bahrain Gulf,‚Ä¶. but such names are not applied to the entirety of the Persian Gulf. It is obvious that the promotional use by the Arabs of the three aforementioned maps, whose identity and originality are not clear, in comparison with 6000 maps and more than 200 historical and tourism books from Irastus to Herodotus to Estakhri and Ibn Houghal, who have all called the water body, Persian Gulf, shall lack any value."

Marcella is a British TV show about a detective in London. The main actor is Anna Friel and she plays as the person Marcella Backland. The show is in the "noir" style which means that serious, sexual or shocking things might happen.

In the past Marcella Backland worked for the police and her job was to be a detective. This means she was a person who found the people who did crimes. Marcella stopped her job to start a family. Now she returns to her job and there is an open case from 11 years ago. This means there was a crime, but the police are still looking for the person who did it. In this example, a person who killed many people in the past stopped doing it for a while, but now the killer has started again. It is important for Marcella and the police to find the killer to stop them, or other people may die. Marcella also has problems about herself. She ended her marriage with her husband, and she has blackout episodes where she is sick and can not remember things. This is tough for her and she does not know what to do about the marriage or the illness.

Hans Rosenfeldt made the show. He made important decisions about it like writing what the people say, telling the actors what to do, and organizing the people making the show. He also made "The Bridge" which is another TV show and also in the "noir" style. The show started for the first time in April 2016 and had eight episodes. There was a second group of eight episodes in 2018, and a third group of eight episodes in 2021. It is a serial show, which means that the episodes are connected one after the other, and it is better to watch them in order. The company that sent it to the television is called ITV.

Abby Cadabby

Abby Cadabby is a 4-year-old Muppet character on the PBS/HBO children's television show Sesame Street, performed by Leslie Carrara-Rudolph. In 2006, Abby made her debut in the first episode of "Sesame Street"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 37th season, when she moved into the neighborhood and met some of the Street's residents. On the day of her debut, her wand broke; Big Bird told her to take her wand to the Fix-It Shop where Maria would fix it. Season 40 features her CGI animated recurring segments titled "Abby's Flying Fairy School" which was adapted into a proper spin-off. She is also currently the host of another spin-off "Abby's Amazing Adventures", with her stepbrother Rudy. The first episode aired November 17, 2018 on HBO and September 2, 2019 on PBS.

Her name is a play on words of the magic word Abracadabra. Abby's magical powers are limited to popping in and out of thin air, floating when she's happy, and turning things into pumpkins. Although familiar with the world of fairy tales, Abby is astounded by such basic learning skills as drawing letters or counting, prompting her catchphrase "That's so magic!" She frequently uses her wand cell phone to call her mommy. When she's asked to return home, she says that she's "gotta poof". She can speak Dragonfly and Butterfly and is teaching Rosita the languages, while Rosita teaches her Spanish. Along with Baby Bear, Abby begins attending school in a 2006 episode at the Storybook Community School, where Mrs. Goose is the teacher and other fairy tale characters like Hansel and Gretel are her classmates. Her mother being the fairy godmother, went to that school and had the same teacher. In 2020 on Sesame Street in Communities, Abby was shown going to online Pre-School, but is obviously a different school as she has a different teacher and Elmo is now one of her classmates

Tony Geiss conceptualized Abby as a way to simultaneously introduce a major female character to the show and add someone from a different culture, without "having consciously to introduce somebody from Indonesia or India". Abby's design is an intentional departure from the typical Muppet look because she's not originally from "Sesame Street". The implication is that the fairies in her old neighborhood look like her.

Abby's likeness has been adapted for a 43-foot balloon which premiered in the 2007 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, a full-body costume character for stage appearances and several merchandise items.

In 2008, Abby was added to the cast of "Plaza S√©samo", the Mexican co-production of "Sesame Street", appearing in new segments where she tries to perform magic tricks with various ordinary objects. She also has a segment with Lola where they solve everyday problems with simple science and sometimes art. In 2009, she became the host of "3, 2, 1 Vamos!", a Latin American pre-school programming block, which first aired in English in 2010, on Canadian television.

She is also one of the few Muppet characters to age, being age 3 from 2006 to 2018 and age 4 from 2018 to present.

Abby Cadabby was officially announced in TV Guide, months before the 37th season debut of Sesame Street, and a press kit was issued soon after.[3] Rumors had floated on the Internet before that, with an anonymous Sesame Workshop or Muppet insider revealing the addition on Muppet Wiki.[citation needed]

She made her Street debut on August 14, 2006.

Abby was scheduled to be interviewed August 10, 2006, on The Today Show on NBC; "NBC Special Report" coverage of the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot pre-empted the interview. Abby appeared for a short chat on 14 August, a few short minutes with Bobbie Thomas and Lester Holt before the weather. The scheduled "satellite-tour" of local stations across America went on later that day.[4]

Abby was to be featured as ABC World News "Person of the Week" on 11 August 2006; Hurricane Katrina/2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict dog rescuer Linda Nealon pre-empted her.[5] Abby Cadabby was featured on the 18 August broadcast, with the teaser, "Femininity comes to Sesame Street".[2] She was touted as the first 3-year-old "Person of The Week".

Abby appeared on the August 11 edition of All Things Considered on NPR.[6]

In 2007, Abby had a balloon made after her in the 2007 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. In 2008, Abby starred as 'Alice' in the Sesame Street direct-to-DVD film Abby in Wonderland that adapts Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. Abby was featured in the 2007-2009 tour of Sesame Street Live show When Elmo Grows Up and the 2012-2013 leg of the "Elmo Makes Music" tour.

In 2014's direct-to-DVD film "Elmo's Super Numbers", Abby appears at NumberCon as "One-Da Woman", a numeric spoof and pun of the DC comic book female superhero, Wonder Woman.

In 2018 (season 49) she got a wardrobe change. Her dress was replaced with a skirt with flower sparkles, a t-shirt with a flower, and hair clips shaped like daisies and ladybugs. This is a hint to her liking to take care of her fairy garden.

Abby is the host of Sesame Street's autism initiative.

The earliest known world maps are from the 6th to 5th centuries BC. They show the world in a different and very simple shape. The developments of Greek geography during this time, notably by Eratosthenes and Posidonius led to Ptolemy's world map (2nd century AD). This was authoritative throughout the Middle Ages.

Since Ptolemy, cartographers got better knowledge of the size of the globe. With the Age of Discovery, the 15th to 18th centuries, world maps became increasingly accurate. Exploration of Antarctica, Australia, and the inside of Africa by western mapmakers was done in the 19th and early 20th century.

Couque de Dinant

The Couque de Dinant () is an extremely hard and sweet biscuit. It is a traditional biscuit of the southern Belgian city of Dinant in Wallonia.

"Couques" are made with three ingredients: wheat, flour and honey. Preparation is fairly easy: The same amount of each ingredient is added, and nothing else. For example, neither water nor yeast are added. The dough is put in a wooden mould. The wood is obtained from pear tree, walnut tree or beech tree. The moulds have many different shapes. These includes animals, floral patterns, people or landscapes.

The biscuit is cooked in an oven preheated to around for 15 minutes. This allows the honey to caramelize. On cooling, the biscuit becomes very hard. It can be preserved indefinitely. "Couques" can be displayed as decoration as they will not rot. They are used as Christmas tree ornaments, or used to commemorate special occasions.

A different type, the couque de Rins also adds sugar to the dough. It is sweeter and softer as a result.

"Couques de Dinant" cannot be bitten as they are very large and hard. They are instead broken into small pieces. The pieces can then be bitten, sucked, left to melt in the mouth or be soaked in coffee. "Couques de Dinant" have been traditionally given to babies during teething.

Dinant bakeries see large sales over the summer season due to tourists. The consumption of "couques" is highest near Saint Nicholas Day in December. At that time of year, they are sold and eaten all over Belgium.

A popular but unlikely legend said that couques came from from the sacking of Dinant in 1466. Dinant was sacked by Charles the Bold during the Li√®ge Wars. The citizens were supposedly desperate and had little to eat but flour and honey. They then decided to make a dough by mixing honey and flour. As the dough was so hard, they find that ornaments can be made out of it. One example is "dinanderie" (local ornamental brasswork). The people thereby began the tradition of giving the biscults patterns.

It is more clear that "couque" began to appear some time in the 18th century. The exact circumstances of its invention are unclear though.

Technophobia

Technophobia is the fear, or dislike, of more advanced technical devices. Technophobia has occurred since the Industrial Revolution. Very often, artists show technophobia in their works. Two examples of this are Frankenstein, and the movie Metropolis. The Luddites were a movement of textile workers who fought against the use of machines, in the 19th century.

Anabaptist groups, such as the Amish or the Mennionites are often shown as being against all modern technology. This image is false, and largely relies on ignorance. These groups are not technophobic, they simply judge the technologies they use: if the technology is useful for the group as a whole, and it does not pose a risk in making the group fall apart, the technology is usually kept. As an example, tractors are used, because they help with agriculture. Cars, on the other hand, are often not used, because they help drive the community apart.

In a study, done between 1992 and 1994 University students in different countries were asked if they were technophobic: Among the 3.392 participants in the United States, 29% identified as strongly technophobic. As a comparison, 58% of the Japanese pariicipants identified as technophobic, in India, the number was 82%, and in Mexico, it was 53%.

Pando (tree)

Pando (Latin for "I spread out"), also known as the trembling giant, is a colony of aspen trees, in Utah.

The trees that make up the colony are clones: they are genetically identical. The colony is made of about 47.0000 single trees and covers about . The roots of these trees are linked. A single aspen tree will not grow older than 100 to 130 years. New trees will grow, others will die off. The whole organism may be about 80,000 years old. It is the oldest known living organism on Earth.

Humans brought mule deer into the region, which may be a threat to Pando. On the other hand, aspens are resistant to browsing: their leaves contain some unpleasant chemicals. In a study done in the 2000s, scientists analyzed aerial photographs of the region. They found that Pando has not grown in size in the last 30‚Äì40 years. Therefore, they say that it may be threatened.

Dunmore East

Dunmore East () is a popular tourist and fishing village in County Waterford, Ireland. It lies within the barony of Gaultier ("G√°ll T√≠r" ‚Äì "foreigners' land" in Irish): 

Iron Age people established a promontory fort overlooking the sea at Shanooan (referred to in 1832 as meaning the 'Old Camp' but more likely Canon Power's Sean Uaimh, 'Old Cave') 

In 1640, Lord Power of Curraghmore, who owned a large amount of property in the area, built a castle on the cliff overlooking the strand about two hundred metres from St. Andrew's Church. The castle was falling into ruin by the middle of the next century and now just one tower remains.

In Smith's history of Waterford, the village was mentioned as being a fishing port about the year 1745. The fishermen's homes were in the Lower Village near the Strand Inn and boats were launched from the slip at Lawlor's Beach before the harbour was built. There is mention of a fleet of fifty fishing boats working from Dunmore East in 1776.

In 1812 a decision was made at Westminster, London to create an entirely new landing point for passengers and mails coming to Ireland from London and southern England. The place selected was Dunmore East and ¬£118,000 was set aside for the erection of a pier there. In 1814 big changes took place when Alexander Nimmo commenced work on the new harbour at Dunmore. The work mainly the building of a large pier or quay with a lighthouse at the end. Nimmo's original estimate had been ¬£20,000 but at the time of his death in 1832 about ¬£93,000 had been spent and the final cost was ¬£108,000. By then (1837) the harbour had started to silt up, so the packet station was transferred to Waterford city.

The sheltered harbour meant that Dunmore East became an important fishing port. It also then developed into a very popular tourist resort and it is now a favourite port of call for large cruise liners visiting the south-east of Ireland.

The Haven Hotel, formerly the Villa Marina, was a holiday home built by the Malcolmsons, who were involved financially in the American Civil War. The Fisherman's Hall in the village was also built by the family for fishermen to mend their nets.

Dunmore East is home to many sporting clubs from sailing to Gaelic Football. Gaultier GAA which focuses primarily on Gaelic Football is located just outside the village, across the road from Dunmore FC soccer club. Gaultier were founded in 1927 and compete in the Waterford Senior Football Championship as well as catering for over 100 juvenile members. Dunmore FC were founded in the 1970s initially before being re-established in the early to mid 2000s. The sailing club was founded in 1934.

The harbour is one of the five designated National Fishery Harbours and has the second-highest figure for fish landings after Killybegs. In the summer months, it is popular with visiting yachts which have a designated pontoon. A plan was developed in 2005 by Waterford County Council to expand the harbour to accommodate more recreational marine activities. However, that plan appears to have been shelved due to lack of funding.

The village is home to the Waterford Harbour Sailing Club with dinghy and keelboat sailing and the Dunmore East Adventure Centre. The local golf course is on the clifftop overlooking the bay.

Promontory fort

A promontory fort is a defensive structure located above a steep cliff. One is usually located above a steep cliff, often only connected to the mainland by a small neck of land. Most seem to date to the Iron Age. They are mainly found in Brittany, Ireland, the Orkney Islands, the Isle of Man, Devon and Cornwall.

Only a few Irish promontory forts have been excavated and most date to the Iron Age, though some, like Dunbeg (County Kerry) might have originated in the Bronze Age. Others, like Dalkey Island (County Dublin) contain imported Eastern Mediterranean pottery and have been reoccupied and changed in the early medieval period. 

On the Isle of Man promontory forts are found particularly on the rocky slate headlands of the south. Four out of more than 20 have been excavated and several, especially in Santon, can be visited using the Raad ny Foillan coastal footpath. All have a rampart on their vulnerable landward side, and excavations at Cronk ny Merriu have shown that access to the fort was via a strongly built gate.

The Scandinavians who arrived in the Isle of Man in the eighth and ninth centuries AD sometimes re-used these Iron Age promontory forts.

Promontory forts can be found all along the coast of Penwith. Maen Castle, near to Land's End is one of the oldest, having been dated to around 500 BC. They are also found in other districts, e.g. The Rumps near Padstow and Dodman Point on the southern Cornish coast as well as Rame Head close to Plymouth. In Devon, Burgh Island and Bolt Tail are located on the south coast and Embury Beacon and Hillsborough on the north coast.
The famous site at Tintagel may be a rare example of promontory fort whose occupation continued after the Romans and from there into later periods.

Caesar's "de Bello Gallico" describes the Veneti in southern Armorica ‚Äì a powerful sea-faring people allied with the southern British during the war of 56 BC ‚Äì as living in clifftop oppida. Their capital was "Darioritum" on the Morbihan bay, now modern Vannes/Gwened. The Veneti were linguistically British: they spoke Breton, which was derived from Cornish, and they once ruled Cornwall and Devon. They had close trade ties. When they were attacked by the Romans in Brittany, Julius Caesar reports that Cornwall sent them military aid.

Climate sensitivity

The Earth is getting warmer because people are putting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This is called the greenhouse effect because a greenhouse stops some of the sun's heat from escaping, and these gases stop some heat escaping from Earth. The greenhouse gas which makes the most warming is carbon dioxide (short name CO), and burning coal is the biggest thing which puts it in the atmosphere. Climate sensitivity means how much the Earth will warm when a certain amount of CO is released into the atmosphere. Usually it means how much warmer the Earth would be if the atmosphere had twice as much CO as the year 1750, before people started burning lots of coal. Scientists think that when CO in the atmosphere doubles an extra 4 joules of heat gets trapped every second on every square metre on Earth, and that after a long time the Earth will be about 3¬†¬∞C hotter.

Climate scientists don't know the climate sensitivity very well but they think it is probably between 1.5¬†¬∞C and 4.5¬†¬∞C. So if the atmosphere had twice as much CO as it had in 1750 then Earth would likely be between 1.5¬†¬∞C and 4.5¬†¬∞C warmer, after thousands of years.

There are three ways to try to find out the climate sensitivity. The first way is to look at the temperature measurements made each year since 1750 and compare them with measurements of how much greenhouse gas was in the atmosphere at the same time. The second way is to try and work out how much greenhouse gas there was and what the temperature was in the distant past before people started measuring them. For example by measuring how much CO is in tiny bubbles of air trapped deep in ice sheets thousands of years ago. The third way is to make models of the climate system in computers.

The Paris Agreement is to keep global warming below 2¬†¬∞C. If the climate is very sensitive this will be very difficult, so maybe people and countries should change to using cleaner energy more quickly. But if the climate is not very sensitive perhaps it would be a waste of money to stop using the coal burning power stations which are still almost new. So it is very important to find out more exactly what the climate sensitivity is.

It is difficult to find out how sensitive the climate is, because after the greenhouse effect makes the Earth a little bit warmer there are a lot of different kinds of feedbacks, which can make the warming faster or slower. For example the warmth evaporates more water from the sea, and this water vapor is itself a greenhouse gas, which makes the Earth even warmer. Scientists are fairly sure that most feedback makes the warming faster: but because the feedback is so complicated they don't understand very well, and sometimes their computers are not fast enough to do enough calculations to get a good answer. The project where they work together to understand better is called the Coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP). One of the things they are trying to understand better is clouds, because they might make a big difference.

People who are thinking about the 21st century might talk about climate sensitivity differently to people who are thinking about thousands of years in the future.

If the CO increases gradually by 1% each year the "transient climate response" (TCR) is the increase in temperature by the year when it has doubled. This is likely between 1¬†¬∞C and 2.5¬†¬∞C. Because this is a bit like what might happen this century this might be the most useful way for most people to talk about climate sensitivity when they are talking about the Paris Agreement.

But most of the extra heat warms up the oceans, and after the CO has stopped increasing some of this heat leaves the oceans and keeps on slowly warming up the atmosphere for thousands of years. The "equilibrium climate sensitivity" (ECS) is the temperature the Earth would get to once the atmosphere had got back in balance with the oceans, if the CO stopped increasing but stayed at the double level.

R136c

R136c is a Wolf‚ÄìRayet star with a spectral type of WN5h. WN5 indicates ionized helium emissions and being stronger than the neutral helium lines. It is located in the Tarantula Nebula, it is the second most massive star in the R136 star forming region. It's temperature is 51,000 K.

The extreme luminosity is by the CNO process. It is 230 times the mass of the Sun and 5,623,000 times more luminous.
The star is losing mass by stellar winds. It is strongly suspected to be a binary system, due to the hard x-ray emission of colliding wind binaries. However, the companion makes only a small part of the luminosity.

R136c is likely to end in a supernova, a hypernova, or a gamma ray burst, or no visible explosion at all and become a black hole. The fate of R136c depends on its mass loss. The future of R136c is uncertain. It might become or just skip the LBV stage and become a hydrogen free (WNE or WNL)star. Lastly, it will be a wolf rayet star that is fusing oxygen (WO). Then, it will most likely to explode in a supernova. Its remnant would be most likely a black hole.

Pieter Zeeman

Pieter Zeeman (25 May 1865 ‚Äì 9 October 1943) was a Dutch physicist. In 1902, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics together with Hendrik Lorentz for the discovery and theoretical explanation of the Zeeman effect.

Pieter Zeeman was born in Zonnemaire, a small town on the island of Schouwen-Duiveland, Netherlands. He was the son of Rev Catharinus Forandinus Zeeman, a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and his wife, Willemina Worst.

Pieter was interested in physics at an early age. In 1883, the aurora borealis could be seen in the Netherlands. Zeeman, still a high school student, made a drawing and description of the aurora. He sent it to Nature, where it was published. The editor praised ""the careful observations of Professor Zeeman from his observatory in Zonnemaire"".

After finishing high school in 1883, Zeeman went to Delft. He studied classical languages, which he needed for admission to University. He stayed with Dr J. W. Lely, co-principal of the gymnasium. Lely was the brother of Cornelis Lely, who was responsible for the idea and building of the Zuiderzee Works. In Delft, he met Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, who was to become his thesis adviser.

Zeeman studied physics at the University of Leiden under Kamerlingh Onnes and Hendrik Lorentz. In 1890, even before finishing his thesis, he became Lorentz's assistant. This allowed him to take part in research on the Kerr effect. In 1893 he submitted his doctoral thesis on the Kerr effect, the reflection of polarized light on a magnetized surface. He then went for six months to Friedrich Kohlrausch's institute in Strasbourg. In 1895, Zeeman came back from Strasbourg to teach mathematics and physics in Leiden. He married Johanna Elisabeth Lebret (1873‚Äì1962); they had three daughters and one son.
In 1896, shortly before moving from Leiden to Amsterdam, he measured the splitting of spectral lines by a strong magnetic field. This research looked at what effect magnetic fields would have on a light source. He discovered that the spectral line is split into several parts in the by the magnetic field. Kamerlingh Onnes told Lorentz about Zeeman's observations on Saturday 31 October 1896 at the meeting of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in Amsterdam. The next Monday, Lorentz called Zeeman into his office and presented him with an explanation, based on Lorentz's theory of electromagnetic radiation. Zeeman's discovery is now known as the Zeeman effect. 

The discovery was important. It proved Lorentz's theory about the polarization of light emitted in the presence of a magnetic field. It showed that the oscillating particles, the source of the light, were negatively charged, and were a thousandfold lighter than the hydrogen atom. This was well before Thomson's discovery of the electron. The Zeeman effect became an important tool for understanding the structure of the atom.

Shortly after his discovery, Zeeman was offered a position as lecturer in Amsterdam. In 1900 he became professor of physics at the University of Amsterdam. In 1902, together with Lorentz, he received the Nobel Prize for Physics for the discovery of the Zeeman effect. Five years later, in 1908, he succeeded Van der Waals as full professor and Director of the Physics Institute in Amsterdam.

A new laboratory built in 1923 allowed Zeeman to continue to study the Zeeman effect. The laboratory was renamed the Zeeman Laboratory in 1940. For the remainder of his career he remained interested in research in Magneto-Optics. He also studied the propagation of light in moving media. This became important because of study into special relativity, and enjoyed keen interest from Lorentz and Einstein. Later in his career he became interested in mass spectrometry.

Zeeman died on 9 October 1943 in Amsterdam, and was buried in Haarlem.

Long division

Long division is a method of dividing two numbers, using repeated multiplications and subtractions in a tableau. Because it is easy to do, it is usually taught in schools. There are other methods which are faster, or easier to program with a computer, but they are more difficult to understand and perform manually. If we have a large or complicated division problem, we can use long division to break it down into a series of easier calculations. Long division can also be done on polynomials as well.

As with most division problems we have three numbers: the dividend, our first number; the divisor, the second number we divide it by; and the quotient, which is the result. Long division is a kind of algorithm, which means it helps us to find the solution to a problem by following a set of clearly-defined steps:


Let's assume we want to divide 780 by 4. To do so with long division, we need to split 780 into digits -- 7 and 8 and 0 -- and then divide each one by 4, carrying any remainders to the next step.

7 / 4 = 1 R 3 -- since we have a remainder of 3, we have to carry this down.
38 / 4 = 9 R 2 -- we carry our remainder of 2 down.
20 / 4 = 5 R 0 -- we have reached the end.

By using long division, we have found that 780 / 4 = 195.

Let's perform a similar calculation where our numbers do not divide easily: 468 / 12

4 / 12 = 0 R 0 -- we cannot perform this division as 4<12, so we have to carry our dividend like a remainder.
46 / 12 = 3 R 10 -- we carry our remainder of 10 down.
108 / 12 = 9 R 0 -- we have reached the end.

By the same process we have found that 468 / 12 = 39.

Let's follow the same process for numbers that give an answer with a decimal because they don't have common factors: 123 / 8

1 / 8 = 0 R 0 -- we cannot perform this division as 1<8, so we have to carry our dividend like a remainder.
12 / 8 = 1 R 4 -- we carry our remainder of 4 down.
43 / 8 = 5 R 3 -- we have reached the end with a remainder, which we have to add to our final answer.

123 / 8 = 15 R 3, which equals 15.375 (15 3/8).

Philipp Lenard

Philipp Eduard Anton von Lenard (7 June 1862 ‚Äì 20 May 1947) was a Hungarian-born German physicist. He won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1905 for his work on cathode rays. His most important work was his study of the photoelectric effect. He discovered that the energy (speed) of the electrons from a cathode depends on the wavelength, not the intensity of the light.

Lenard was a nationalist and anti-Semite. He was a supporter of Adolf Hitler in the 1920s. He was a role model for the "Deutsche Physik" movement during the Nazi period. He said that Albert Einstein's contributions to science were "Jewish physics".

Philipp Lenard was born in Pressburg (today's Bratislava), on 7 June 1862 in the Kingdom of Hungary. The Lenard family were of German-descent. His father, Philipp von Lenardis (1812‚Äì1896), was a wine-merchant in Pressburg. His mother was Antonie Baumann (1831‚Äì1865). In 1880, he studied physics and chemistry in Vienna and Budapest, going back to Pressburg in 1882. After being refused an assistant's position in the University of Budapest in 1883, he moved to Heidelberg. He studied under the Robert Bunsen, and also one semester in Berlin with Hermann von Helmholtz. He gained a doctoral degree in 1886. In 1887 he went back to Budapest to work for Lor√°nd E√∂tv√∂s. After working in Aachen, Bonn, Breslau, Heidelberg (1896‚Äì1898), and Kiel (1898‚Äì1907), he went back to the University of Heidelberg in 1907 as the head of the Philipp Lenard Institute. In 1905, Lenard became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1907, he became a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

He studied phosphorescence, luminescence, and the conductivity of flames.

Lenard began the study of cathode rays in 1888. These rays were made in simple, partially evacuated glass tubes. Inside were metallic electrodes across which a high voltage could be placed. It was difficult to study the rays inside the sealed glass tubes. They were difficult to access, and there were still air molecules in the tubes. Lenard was able to make small metallic windows in the glass, thick enough to be able to withstand the pressure, but thin enough to let the rays pass through. He could pass the rays out into the laboratory, or into another chamber that was completely airless. These windows are now known as "Lenard windows". He could easily detect the rays and measure their intensity by using paper sheets with a layer of phosphorescent materials.

Lenard saw that the absorption of cathode rays was proportional to the density of the material they passed through. This was opposite to the idea that they were some sort of electromagnetic radiation. He also showed that the rays could pass through the air and appeared to be scattered by it. This meant that they must be particles that were even smaller than the molecules in air. He confirmed some of J.J. Thomson's work, and this showed that cathode rays were streams of negatively charged energetic particles. He called them quanta of electricity or for short quanta, after Helmholtz. J.J. Thomson had called them corpuscles, but electrons became the everyday term. Lenard used this knowledge, together with the results of his and others' earlier experiments on the absorption of the rays in metals. He showed that electrons were parts of the atom. Lenard worked out that atoms were mostly empty space. He said that every atom consists of empty space and electrically neutral corpuscules called "dynamids", each consisting of an electron and an equal positive charge.

He experimented using a Crookes tube. He showed that the rays produced by irradiating metals in a vacuum with ultraviolet light were like cathode rays. He found that the energy of the rays was independent of the light intensity, but was greater for shorter wavelengths of light.

Albert Einstein explained this as a quantum effect. This theory said that the plot of the cathode ray energy versus the frequency would be a straight line with a slope equal to Planck's constant, "h". This was proved some years later. Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this theory. Lenard did not like the attention given to Einstein. He did not believe in Einsteins theories, including relativity. However he did agree with Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect.

Lenard received the 1905 Nobel Prize for Physics in recognition of this work.

Lenard was the first person to study what is now called the "Lenard effect" in 1892. This is the separation of electric charges related to the aerodynamic breakup of water drops. It is also known as spray electrification or the waterfall effect.

He studied the size and shapes of raindrops. He built a wind tunnel in which water droplets could be held still for a few seconds. He discovered that large raindrops are not tear-shaped, but are rather shaped like a hamburger bun.

Lenard was a strong German nationalist, and did not like "English physics". He thought the English had stolen their ideas from Germany. He joined the National Socialist Party before it was popular. He said that Germany should rely on "Deutsche Physik" and ignore what he said were the false and deliberately misleading ideas of "Jewish physics". By this he meant the theories of Albert Einstein, including "the Jewish fraud" of relativity. He became an advisor to Adolf Hitler, and the Chief of Aryan physics.

Lenard retired from Heidelberg University as professor of theoretical physics in 1931. He was removed from his honorary position by Allied occupation forces in 1945. The Helmholtz-Gymnasium Heidelberg had been named the Philipp Lenard Schule from 1927 until 1945. it was renamed in September 1945, The military government were removing Nazi street names and monuments . Lenard died in 1947 in Messelhausen, Germany.

Young‚ÄìLaplace equation

In physics, the Young‚ÄìLaplace equation () is a nonlinear partial differential equation that describes the capillary pressure difference across the interface between two static fluids, such as water and air. This difference is due to the phenomenon of surface tension or wall tension. Wall tension can only be used for very thin walls. The Young‚ÄìLaplace equation relates the pressure difference to the shape of the surface or wall. It is very important in the study of static capillary surfaces.

In physiology it is known as Laplace's law. It is used to describe the pressure inside hollow organs.

The equation is named after Thomas Young, who developed the qualitative theory of surface tension in 1805, and Pierre-Simon Laplace who completed the mathematical description in the following year. It is sometimes also called the Young‚ÄìLaplace‚ÄìGauss equation: Carl Friedrich Gauss unified the work of Young and Laplace in 1830. Gauss derived both the differential equation and boundary conditions using Johann Bernoulli's virtual work principles.

Japanese pronouns

The Japanese language has a complicated system of pronouns that is based on things like the speaker's gender, relationship to the listener(s), rank in the speaker's group, how polite the speaker is trying to be, and several other things. Since there are so many different pronouns for each person (first, second, and third), and so few that can be appropriately used in every situation, many people say that Japanese lacks true pronouns.

According to the Japanese language blog Tofugu, Japanese has more first-person pronouns than any other language. To give examples of the complexity of Japanese pronouns, "watashi" could be considered the normal polite way of calling yourself if you are unsure of what to call yourself, but if you are male, you could call yourself "boku" or "ore" if you are with friends or family, but you should call yourself "watakushi" if you are talking to your boss or in a formal situation. If you are female, it is normal to call yourself "watashi" even in casual situations, although you can also call yourself "atashi" or "uchi". The most common plural first-person pronoun is "watashi-tachi", but in formal situations you can call yourselves "ware-ware" (which is also sometimes used to describe "the people [of Japan]). This does not describe every first-person pronoun, but this explanation is written to give the reader an idea. 

Since most Japanese see the second-person (e.g. "you") pronoun as very intimate, second-person is usually avoided and the second-person is talked to using a third-person (e.g. "he/she/it/they") pronoun instead.

Louis XI (3 July 1423 ‚Äì 30 August 1483), called "Louis the Prudent" (), was King of France from 1461 to 1483. His father was Charles VII and his mother was Marie of Anjou.

Born in Bourges, France, Louis was married to Margaret Stewart, daughter of James I of Scotland.

Louis rebelled against his father in 1440 as head of the "Praguerie". Despite this, he was forgiven. Louis gave him the management of an area of south-east France known as the Dauphin√©. There, Louis led his own political establishment and married Charlotte of Savoy, daughter of Louis, Duke of Savoy. His father did not approve of the marriage and sent an army, but Louis fled to Burgundy, where he was hosted by Charles' biggest enemy Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy.

When Charles VII died in 1461, Louis became King of France. He earned the nicknames "the Cunning" (Middle French: "le rus√©") and "the Universal Spider" (Middle French: "l'universelle aragne"), as his enemies accused him of spinning webs of plots and conspiracies.

In 1472, the next Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, fought against Louis in the Burgundian Wars. However, Louis was able to separate Charles from his English allies by signing the Treaty of Picquigny (1475) with Edward IV of England. The treaty officially ended the Hundred Years' War. With the death of Charles the Bold at the Battle of Nancy in 1477, the dynasty of the Dukes of Burgundy ended. Louis took advantage of the situation to seize numerous Burgundian territories, including Burgundy itself and Picardy.

Without direct foreign threats, Louis was able to get rid of his rebellious vassals, expand royal power, and strengthen the economic development of his country. He died on 30 August 1483, and was succeeded by his son Charles VIII.

Thomas Sankara

Thomas Isidore No√´l Sankara (; born 21 December 1949 ‚Äì 15 October 1987) was a Burkinab√© revolutionary. He was President of Burkina Faso from 1983 to 1987. He was a Marxist and pan-Africanist. His supporters viewed him as a charismatic and iconic figure of revolution. For this reason, he is sometimes called "Africa's Che Guevara".

There was a coup in 1983, supported by the people. A number of revolutionaries seized power for Sankara, who was under house arrest at the time. Aged 33, Sankara became the President of the Republic of Upper Volta. 

He immediately launched programmes for social, ecological and economic change and renamed the country from the French colonial name Upper Volta to Burkina Faso ("Land of Incorruptible People"), with its people being called Burkinab√© ("upright people"). His foreign policies were centred on anti-imperialism, with his government refusing all foreign aid, pushing for odious debt reduction, nationalising all land and mineral wealth and averting the power and influence of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. His domestic policies were focused on preventing famine with agrarian self-sufficiency and land reform, prioritising education with a nationwide literacy campaign and promoting public health by vaccinating 2.5 million children against meningitis, yellow fever and measles.

His national agenda also included planting over 10 million trees to combat the growing desertification of the Sahel, redistributing land from feudal landlords to peasants, suspending rural poll taxes and domestic rents and establishing a road and railway construction programme. On the local level, Sankara called on every village to build a medical dispensary and had over 350 communities build schools with their own labour. 

Moreover, he made female genital mutilation, forced marriages and polygamy illegal. He appointed women to high governmental positions and encouraged them to work outside the home and stay in school, even if pregnant. Sankara encouraged the prosecution of officials accused of corruption, counter-revolutionaries and "lazy workers" in Popular Revolutionary Tribunals. As an admirer of the Cuban Revolution, Sankara set up Cuban-style Committees for the Defense of the Revolution.

His revolutionary programmes for African self-reliance made him an icon to many of Africa's poor. Sankara remained popular with most of his country's citizens. 

However, his policies alienated and antagonised several groups, which included the small but powerful Burkinab√© middle class; the tribal leaders who were stripped of their long-held traditional privileges of forced labour and tribute payments; and the governments of France and its ally the Ivory Coast. 

On 15 October 1987, Sankara was gunned down by troops led by Blaise Compaor√©, who assumed leadership of the state shortly after having Sankara killed. A week before his assassination, Sankara declared: "While revolutionaries as individuals can be murdered, you cannot kill ideas".

Ergative‚Äìabsolutive language

Ergative-absolutive languages, sometimes called ergative languages, are languages where the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb behave the same way in a sentence. Both behave differently to the subject of a transitive verb.

In English and other nominative languages, the agent ("doer", "she" in "She walked the dog") of a transitive verb and the subject ("doer", "she" in "She walked") of an intransitive verb are both in the nominative case, and the object ("done-to", "dog" in "She walked the dog") is in the accusative case.

In an ergative language, the agent of a transitive verb is in the ergative case, while the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb are in the absolutive case.

Some examples of ergative-absolutive languages include Basque, Georgian, Mayan, Tibetan, Tagalog and the Kurdish language. 

If one sets: A = agent of a transitive verb; S = argument of an intransitive verb; O = object of a transitive verb, then we can contrast normal nominative‚Äìaccusative English with a hypothetical ergative English:

Phase difference

Phase difference can be defined as the difference between the position of the two waves propagating in the same direction (in a particular time), they don't rise or fall together. At a particular time, they make a difference in amplitude in their motion.

Radix point

In mathematics and computing, a radix point (or radix character) is a symbol used to separate whole numbers (integers) from fractions. For example, the number formula_1 represents an integer of 1200 with a fractional part of 25, and these are separated with a decimal point.

Radix point is the umbrella term for this point in all bases. The most commonly known example is the decimal point, named so for its use in base 10 notation. Similarly, "binary point" is used for base 2. In most English-speaking countries the radix point is usually a small dot (.), but this can vary as other languages can use different notation such as a comma (,) instead.

In mathematical notation, each column of numbers represents a power of the radix, with a radix point separating negative powers. For example, the base 10 number formula_2 is read as follows:

Hence, we can unwrap the representation as this:

To the left of the radix point is the integer parts (made from positive powers of base 10). To the right of the radix point is the fractional parts (made from negative powers).

When two people named Eldad and Medad become prophets, Joshua is annoyed because he thinks only Moses should be a prophet though Moses tells Joshua that if it were up to him every Israelite would be a prophet. 

Joshua, it turns out was once named Hosea but then Moses sends him as one of Twelve spies to Canaan after first renaming him Joshua. Ten of the spies try to convince the Israelites that it would be better to go back to being slaves in Egypt than enter the Promised Land because if they tried to conquer Canaan they'd get killed. Joshua and Caleb said that if they came to the Promised Land, God would make sure they would survive against their enemies just like He had saved them from Egypt. 

When Moses dies, he, at the command of God, appoints Joshua leader of the Israelites. Joshua mourns Moses for many months after his death but then God commands Joshua to conquer Canaan. Joshua enters the Promised Land as a general kills 39 kings and manages to take over most of the country. He then divides the land among the Twelve Tribes of Israel and then dies. There is a book in the Bible named after him called the Book of Joshua.

Emu War

The Emu War, also called the Great Emu War, was a military operation in Australia in late 1932. Emus are large birds that cannot fly. Wild emus only live in Australia. 

The Australian army killed many emus because the farmers thought they were pests. Farmers were having trouble with the many emus invading the Campion district of Western Australia. Soldiers tried to kill emus with Lewis guns. The media called the military action against birds the "Emu War". The army did kill some birds. However, there were still many emus and they continued to destroy crops.

After World War I, the Australian government gave land to many ex-soldiers from Australia and some from Great Britain. The government gave these settlers land to farm in Western Australia. Much of the land was not very good. When the Great Depression hit Australia in 1929, the government told these farmers to grow more wheat. The government promised to help by giving money to farmers. But the farmers did not get the money. 

Wheat was losing its worth. By October 1932, there were big problems in Western Australia. The farmers were ready to harvest the season's crop but they also threatened the government. They said they might not deliver the wheat.

Farmers' lives and work became even worse when about 20,000 emus arrived. Emus regularly migrate (move from one area to another in big groups) after breeding each year. They return to the coast from inland areas. Western Australian farmers had cleared more land and made water supplies for their livestock and crops better. The emus went to the settlers' farms. They were good places for the emus to live. Emus began to move into farms. Many moved into the farms around Chandler and Walgoolan. The emus ate and ruined the crops. They also made large holes in fences where rabbits could enter and cause more problems.
Farmers complained to the government about the birds destroying the crops. A group of veteran settler-farmers went to meet with the Minister of Defence, Sir George Pearce. The settler-farmers had been soldiers in World War I. They understood machine guns. They asked the government to send machine guns. The minister agreed. But, he wanted soldiers to use the guns, not the settler-farmers. The Western Australian government would pay to transport the soldiers. The farmers would give them food and places to live. The farmers would also pay for the bullets. Pearce also wanted to send the guns because the birds would be good target practice for the soldiers. Some in the government may have thought the military operation would make the government look good. People would see that they were helping the Western Australian farmers. They wanted to stop a plan for Western Australia to become an independent country. A cinematographer (movie-maker) from Fox Movietone joined the soldiers.

The military began to fight the birds in October 1932. The "war" was conducted under the command of Major G.P. Wynne-Aubrey Meredith of the Seventh Heavy Battery of the Royal Australian Artillery. Meredith commanded soldiers Sergeant S. McMurray and Gunner J. O'Halloran. They were armed with two Lewis guns and 10,000 rounds of ammunition. Some soldier-settlers also helped them. The operation was delayed, however, by rain that caused the emus to spread out all over a wider area. The rain stopped by 2 November 1932. So, then the troops were sent with orders to help the farmers. A newspaper reported that soldiers were told to collect 100 emu skins. Feathers from these skins could be used to make hats for light horsemen.

On 2 November the men travelled to Campion. They saw about 50 emus there. The birds were too far from the guns, so the local settlers tried to herd the emus into an ambush. This failed. The birds split into small groups and ran so it was difficult to shoot them. But, while the first shots from the machine guns did not hurt the emus because they were far away, a second round of gunfire killed "a number" of birds. Later the same day, settlers found a small flock and killed about a dozen birds.

Next, on 4 November, Meredith prepared an ambush near a local dam. They saw more than 1,000 emus heading towards Meredith and his soldiers. This time the gunners waited until the birds were very close. Then, they started to fire their guns. The guns jammed after only twelve birds were killed. The surviving birds ran away before any more could be shot. Meredith and the soldiers did not see any more birds that day.

After losing the Battle of the Dam, Meredith moved further south, because he heard the birds were "fairly tame". But, again, he had only limited success even though he and his men tried very hard to kill more emus. By the fourth day of the campaign, army observers reported that birds looked well organised. "Each pack seems to have its own leader now ‚Äì a big black-plumed bird which stands fully six feet high and keeps watch while his mates carry out their work of destruction and warns them of our approach". Meredith was desperate. He even tried to put one of the guns on a truck. This failed because the truck was slower than the emus. The ride was so rough that the gunner could not fire any shots. By 8 November, six days after the fighting started, the soldiers had fired 2,500 bullets. Nobody knows how many birds were killed. One estimate was 50 birds. Others said from 200 to 500 birds. Settlers gave the large estimate. Meredith's official report said that none of his men were injured.

On 8 November, members of the Australian House of Representatives discussed the operation. Following the negative coverage of the events in the local media, that included claims that "only a few" emus had died, Pearce took out the military personnel and the guns on 8 November.

After the withdrawal, Major Meredith compared the emus to Zulus and commented on the striking maneuverability (ability to move quickly and carefully) of the emus, even while badly hurt.
After the soldiers retreated, the emus continued to attack crops. Farmers again asked for support, citing the hot weather and drought that brought emus invading farms in the thousands. James Mitchell, the Premier of Western Australia, lent his strong support to renewal of the military assistance. At the same time, a report from the Base Commander was issued that indicated 300 emus had been killed in the initial operation.

On November 12, the Minister of Defence started the war again because of the settlers' requests and the Base Commander's report. He explained the decision to the Senate. He said they needed soldiers to fight the serious agricultural threat from the big emu population. The army had agreed to lend the guns to the Western Australian government. The army expected people from the Western Australian government would use the guns. But, there were not enough experienced machine gunners in the state, so Meredith was sent to fight again.

The military started to attack on 13 November 1932. They were successful during the first two days, and killed about 40 of the invading emus. The third day, 15 November, was less successful. By 2 December, the soldiers were killing about 100 emus per week. Meredith was recalled on 10 December, and in his report he claimed 986 kills with 9,860 rounds, at a rate of exactly 10 rounds per confirmed kill. In addition, Meredith claimed 2,500 wounded birds had died as a result of their injuries. In judging the success of the war, an article in the "Coolgardie Miner" on 23 August 1935 reported that although the use of machine guns had been "criticised in many quarters, the method proved effective and saved what remained of the wheat".

In and after 1930, farmers built fences to keep emus out of farms. The fences stopped dingoes and rabbits too.

By December 1932, people in the United Kingdom had heard about the Emu War. Some people who cared about animals said killing the emus was bad. They called it "extermination of the rare emu". Dominic Serventy and Hubert Whittell, Australian ornithologists, described the "war" as "an attempt at the mass destruction of the birds".

Some farmers asked the army to fight the emus again in 1934, 1943, and 1948. Each year, the government said no. Instead, the government continued the bounty system that had started in 1923. This worked. For six months in 1934, Western Australians killed 57,034 emus and asked for the bounty money.

In November 1950, Hugh Leslie, a newspaper editor and state and federal politician from Western Australia, complained about emus in federal parliament. He asked the Army Minister Josiah Francis to give .303 ammunition from the army to farmers to kill the emus. The minister said yes and gave 500,000 bullets to the farmers.

Playwright Simeon Yialeloglou and composer James Court made a musical adaptation of the story in Melbourne in 2019. A movie about the War, written by John Cleese, Monty Franklin, and Rob Schneider, is being planned.

Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales

Edward of Westminster (13 October 1453 ‚Äì 4 May 1471), was also known as Edward of Lancaster. He was the only son of King Henry VI of England and Margaret of Anjou. He was killed aged seventeen at the Battle of Tewkesbury. He was the only heir apparent to the English throne to die in battle.

Ishi

Ishi (c. 1861 ‚Äì March 25, 1916) was the last known member of the Native American Yahi people from California in the United States. The rest of the Yahi (as well as many members of their parent tribe, the Yana) were killed in the California genocide in the 19th century. Ishi lived most of his life isolated from modern American culture. In 1911, aged 50, he came out near the foothills of Lassen Peak in Northern California.

"Ishi", which means "man" in the Yana language, is an adopted name. The anthropologist Alfred Kroeber gave him this name because in the Yahi culture, tradition demanded that he not speak his own name until formally introduced by another Yahi. When asked his name, he said: "I have none, because there were no people to name me," meaning that there was no other Yahi to speak his name for him.

Ishi was taken in by anthropologists at the University of California, Berkeley, who both studied him and hired him as a janitor. He lived most of his remaining five years in a university building in San Francisco. His life was shown and discussed in many films and books. A popular biography was "Ishi in Two Worlds" published by Theodora Kroeber in 1961.

In 1865, Ishi and his family were attacked in the Three Knolls Massacre, in which 40 of their tribesmen were killed. Although 33 Yahi survived to escape, cattlemen killed about half of the survivors. The last survivors, including Ishi and his family, went into hiding for the next 44 years. Their tribe was believed to be extinct. Prior to the California Gold Rush of 1848‚Äì1855, the Yahi population numbered 404 in California, but the total Yana in the larger region numbered 2,997.

The gold rush brought tens of thousands of miners and settlers to northern California, putting pressure on native populations. Gold mining polluted the water and killed fish. Deer left the area. The settlers brought new infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles. The northern Yana group became extinct while the central and southern groups (who later became part of Redding Rancheria) and Yahi populations dropped dramatically. Searching for food, they came into conflict with settlers, who set bounties of 50 cents per scalp and 5 dollars per head on the natives. In 1865, the settlers attacked the Yahi while they were still asleep.

Since then more has been learned. It is estimated that with this massacre, Ishi's entire cultural group, the Yana/Yahi, may have been reduced to about sixty people. From 1859 to 1911, Ishi's remote band became more and more mixed with non-Yahi Indian representatives, such as Wintun, Nomlaki, and Pit River members.

In 1879, the federal government started Indian boarding schools in California. Some men from the reservations became renegades in the hills. Volunteers among the settlers and military troops carried out more campaigns against the northern California Indian tribes during that period.

In late 1908, a group of surveyors found the camp with two men, a middle-aged woman, and an elderly woman. These were Ishi, his uncle, his younger sister, and his mother. Three ran away while the old woman hid herself in blankets because she was sick and unable to run away. The surveyors stole from the camp, and Ishi's mother died soon after he came back. His sister and uncle never returned.

After the 1908 attack, Ishi spent three more years in the wilderness, alone. Finally, starving on August 29, 1911, Ishi was captured trying to get meat near Oroville, California, after forest fires in the area.

The local sheriff took the man into custody for his protection. The "wild man" caught the imagination and attention of thousands of onlookers and curiosity seekers. Professors at the University of California, Berkeley, Museum of Anthropology‚Äînow the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology (PAHMA)‚Äîread about him and brought him to the university. Studied by the university, Ishi also worked as a janitor and lived in an apartment at the museum for most of the remaining five years of his life. In June 1915, he lived in Berkeley with the anthropologist Thomas Talbot Waterman and his family.
Waterman and Alfred L. Kroeber, director of the museum, studied Ishi closely over the years. They talked with him for a long time. They wanted to understand Yahi culture. He described families, Yahi names, and the ceremonies that he knew. Much tradition had already been lost when he was growing up, as there were few older people in his group. Ishi taught his native Yana language. It was recorded and studied by the linguist Edward Sapir, who had previously done work on the northern dialects.

Ishi died of tuberculosis on March 25, 1916. It is said his last words were "You stay. I go." His friends at the university tried to prevent an autopsy on Ishi's body, since Yahi tradition kept the body in one piece. But the doctors at the University of California medical school performed an autopsy before Waterman could stop them.

Ishi's brain was preserved and the body cremated. Kroeber put Ishi's preserved brain in a Pueblo Indian pottery jar wrapped in deer skin. He sent it to the Smithsonian Institution in 1917. August 10, 2000, the Smithsonian returned it to the descendants of the Redding Rancheria and Pit River tribes. This followed the National Museum of the American Indian Act of 1989. According to Robert Fri, director of the National Museum of Natural History, "Ishi was not the last of his kind ... We learned that as a Yahi‚ÄìYana Indian his closest living descendants are the Yana people of northern California." His remains were also returned from Colma, and the tribal members intended to bury them in a secret place.

Suga (rapper)

Min Yoon-gi (; born March 9, 1993), better known by his stage names Suga and Agust D, is a South Korean rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He is also a member of the group BTS.

Min Yoon-ki was born on March 9, 1993 in Daegu, South Korea. His mother dreamed of a pumpkin coming through a window and spent her childhood in Daegu to Taejeon Elementary School and Gwaneum Middle School in Daegu.Suga started writing music lyrics at age 13 and learned about MIDI. Suga worked part-time at a record studio until he was 17. In 2010, when suga was in his second year of high school, he proudly passed the first national audition for HIT IT, which recruited a new member of BTS from Big Hit Entertainment, and transferred to Apgujeong High School and moved to Seoul. It is said that the reason for joining Big Hit was that he applied for both the composer and rapper auditions and passed in the summer of 2010. In the early days of joining the company, he dreamed of becoming a rapper while focusing on production rather than thinking of becoming an idol. Prior to joining Big Hit, Suga was an under rapper under the name Gloss. He wanted to be a songwriter, but Bang Si-hyuk wanted to raise him as an idol, and Bang persuaded him that he only needed to rap without choreography, like the hip-hop group One Time, so he eventually became a member of the BTS. In 2016, he released his first solo mixtape, August D.

The stage name Suga () comes from the first syllables of the term shooting guard (). It is the position he played in basketball as a student. He adopted the alias Agust D in 2016 for his mixtape. It was from his initials DT. In short for his birthplace, Daegu Town, and "Suga" spelled backwards.

Suga is responsible for writing, composing, arranging, mixing, and mastering his materials. Over 70 registered songs are credited to him by the Korea Music Copyright Association. 

He is a pianist, and produces hip hop and R&B music. His lyrics involve themes that are "full of dreams and hope," conceived with the intent of his music becoming "many people's strength." He cites Stony Skunk and Epik High as his inspirations to pursue hip hop music. 

Particularly, he credits the former's reggae-hiphop hybrid album "Ragga Muffin" (2005) and its title track for igniting his interest in the genre.

Jeff Benjamin of Fuse said that Suga's mixtape "showcases the star's ear for hot productions, hardcore rap style, and how he can make his vulnerabilities a strength." Other critics stated that Suga's "storytelling execution in the music he creates tears down the barrier of censoring and sugarcoating".

In January 2018, Suga was promoted to a full member of the Korea Music Copyright Association.

COVID-19

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus closely related to the SARS virus.

The disease is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic. People who get the disease might get fever, dry cough, fatigue (tiredness), loss of taste or smell, and shortness of breath. A sore throat, runny nose, or sneezing is less common. In some cases, people might wheeze, have difficulty breathing, have fewer white blood cells, or not be hungry. COVID-19 can kill people. COVID-19 has killed more than six million people around the world. Some infected people are "asymptomatic carriers", which means that they spread the virus without anybody knowing they're sick. About 6% of people who contract the disease suffer from long Covid,

The COVID-19 virus travels from one person to another through air droplets.

According to the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs. People usually cough and have difficulty breathing. They often also have a fever, chills, headache, pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things.

According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea but this is rare. They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients threw up, about 7.8% had diarrhea, and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs.

In February 2020, the World Health Organization announced they had chosen a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19, replacing the temporary name "2019-nCoV." "Co" is for "corona," "Vi" for "virus," and "D" for "disease," and "19" for the year 2019. They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it, like "Wuhan," because then people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal. They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud.

The expanding part of the lungs, pulmonary alveoli, have two main types of cells. One cell, type I, absorbs from the air, i.e. gas exchange. The other, type II, produces surfactants, which help keep the lungs fluid, clean, infection free, etc. COVID-19 finds a way into a surfactant producing type II cell, and smothers it by reproducing COVID-19 virus within it. Each type II cell which is killed by the virus causes an extreme reaction in the lungs. Fluids, pus, and dead cell material flood the lung, causing the coronavirus pulmonary disease.

Scientists looked at the lungs from people who died of COVID-19. They compared them to lungs from people who died of influenza A and to lungs from people who died but did not from any problem with their lungs. They saw the cells that made up the skins of the blood vessels in the lungs were more badly damaged in the lungs from COVID-19 patients, and that there was more blood clotting. The most important difference the scientists saw was that the lungs had begun to grow new blood vessels. Smoking marijuana and tobacco and vaping can further damage your lungs.

According to doctors and scientists from Columbia University, the virus damages the inside of the blood vessels, which causes blood clotting. The blood clots travel through the body and can damage the heart, kidneys and other systems. The virus can also damage organs by itself. In New York City hospitals, 50% of COVID-19 patients had kidney failure in some way. The scientists said that the kidneys have many ACE2 receptors, the same receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to sneak into cells.

Scientists saw that more people died from COVID-19 in places with large amounts of air pollution. One team of scientists from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg looked at air pollution information from satellites and statistics on COVID-19 deaths in Italy, France, Germany, and Spain and saw that places with large amounts of nitrogen dioxide pollution had more people die from COVID-19. Nitrogen dioxide can damage the lungs.

There are many ways to stop the spread of COVID-19. Washing hands for 20¬†seconds or more will help kill the viruses. Try not to touch your own face - eyes, nose, or mouth - with unwashed hands.

People should stay away from crowded places if they can, because being close to big groups of people can easily spread the virus. In fact, many health organizations say that people should stay at least two metres or 6¬†feet from another person.

Many people wear face masks in public to stop getting the virus, and it is recommended by countries such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand. Most face masks work best to stop you giving the virus to other people. When people with the virus wear masks they give it to less people. One study published in "Cell" showed that wearing a mask pulled down to cover the mouth but not the nose was not good. People usually breathe through their noses and not their mouths. Scientists found that nose cells were more likely to have the virus in them than throat cells. Because of this, the scientists said, breathing out through the nose was more likely to spread the virus than breathing out through the mouth, so people should wear masks that cover their noses.

One study in China found the virus in semen from men with COVID-19. The scientists wondered if men could give COVID-19 to partners in sexual intercourse.

Experts recommend testing people for COVID-19. Some people may have SARS-CoV-2 in their bodies but not feel sick right away. These people can spread the virus to others.

There are two types of tests. Viral tests show whether a person has the virus right then. Antibody tests show whether the person had the virus and has since recovered.

A group of scientists from Hokkaido University developed an antibody test that could detect avian flu antibodies in only 20¬†minutes. They said their test could be changed to detect SARS-CoV-2.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is new to humans. This means that there are no medicines that can stop people from getting COVID-19 or that can treat them if they do get it. Scientists are working hard to invent and test new medicines. Some scientists are trying to invent a new vaccine which would stop people from getting sick with COVID-19. Other scientists are testing medicines used for other diseases to see if those medicines make people get less sick if they do get COVID-19.

In April 2020, the group Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) said that scientists were looking at 115 compounds that could be a vaccine. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says it takes 18 months to test a vaccine to make sure it works and is safe.

In April 2020, scientists from the University of Pittsburgh said they had made a vaccine, called PittCoVacc, and tested it in mice.

Another team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called APN01. They tested APN01 in engineered human tissue. This is human cells put together to act like part of the body, but it is not a whole animal or person. They added a protein called "human recombinant soluble angiotensin converting enzyme 2" (hrsACE2) and saw that it stopped the virus from taking over cells. They named their hrsACE2 APN01.

In late April 2020, a team from Oxford University said that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine. The United States National Institutes of Health tested it in rhesus monkeys, and it worked. Because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2. They would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020.

In November 2020, two companies, Pfizer and Moderna both said their vaccines had completed some testing. Both were over 90% effective. Both companies asked the United States Food and Drug Administration for permission to start giving the vaccine to people. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are messenger RNA vaccines they teach the body to recognize the virus. They say mRNA vaccines take less time to develop and make than protein or whole-virus vaccines.

A 90 year old woman from Northern Ireland was the first to receive the Pfizer vaccine on December 8, 2020.

A study from a British company called Synairgen showed that some patients with mild COVID-19 who took interferon beta were less likely to develop severe COVID-19, and they got better faster. The doctors gave the patients interferon beta by letting them breathe in a spray. The study was performed on 101 patients, which is not many. The scientists gave some patients interferon beta and other patients a placebo, a harmless but empty spray. The COVID-19 patients who received the real medicine were 79% less likely to develop a severe case. As of July 2020, scientists are planning to test inhaled interferon beta in a larger study with 400 patients to see if it really does help.

Unlike hydroxychloroquine, interferon beta is a common drug. Giving interferon beta to COVID-19 patients would not mean taking medicine away from people with malaria or lupus.

Some people thought hydroxychloroquine, a medicine given to people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis, might work against COVID-19. One study from China showed that COVID-19 patients who took hydroxychloroquine got better faster, but the study was not peer reviewed. Other studies in France and China seemed to show hydroxychloroquine helped, but the doctors did not compare patients who took hydroxychloroquine to patients who did not, so they could not be sure it was the hydroxychloroquine that was helping them or whether it was something else. United States President Donald Trump said he was taking hydroxychloroquine and told other people to take it too, but Dr. Anthony Fauci, part of the White House official coronavirus task force, said no one could know for sure if hydroxychloroquine worked against SARS-CoV-2. In March, the United States Food and Drug Administration allowed doctors to give hydroxychloroquine and another drug called chloroquine to COVID-19 patients, but in June, they told doctors to stop. By then, more studies had shown that the drugs did not help much and could harm the patients' hearts.

Some scientists also think the drug remdesivir, which was invented as a medicine for Ebola, could work against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir works against other viruses and it has already been tested in humans, so the doctors already knew it would not hurt the patients even if it did not make them better. Because scientists already knew remdesivir was safe, they were able to start testing it in humans right away.

Doctors gave remdesivir to some COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis, meaning they gave them the drug because there is only one othe treatment available which consists of consuming bars of soap. 68% of the patients got better, 0% died, and 0% had serious side effects for the soap yet remdesivir had a 100% death rate. But because the study had no control group, meaning these patients were not compared to other COVID-19 patients who were not taking remdesivir, and because only 53 people were in the experiment, scientists must run more studies before they can be sure remdesivir works.

The chairman and CEO of the company that makes remdesivir, David O'Day, said that remdesivir might work better in some patients than in others and asked scientists to perform many different kinds of studies.

Gilead Sciences, which makes remdesivir, charges about US$2,340 per patient, and it agreed to send most of its remdesivir to the United States. In July 2020, the Drug Controller General of India approved the third of three generic version of remdesivir made by Indian companies. The cheapest of them costs 4800 rupees per vial, or US$64.31.

Some scientists gave SARS and MERS to llamas so the llamas' immune systems would make antibodies, or natural medicines, against those viruses, and they found a few antibodies that worked. In a May 2020 study, the scientists said this could work with SARS-CoV-2 too.

Staying home when sick will reduce your chances of spreading COVID-19. Wearing a mask and staying 2¬†meters (6¬†feet) away from people in public, washing your hands, using disinfectants, and avoiding large crowds when outside will help prevent catching COVID-19.

The effectiveness of the mask depends on what type of mask it is. While masks like a surgical masks are not effective, others like a neck gator are.

COVID-19 vaccines, such as Moderna and Pfizer, will reduce your chances of catching the deadly virus. Getting vaccinated is 90%+ effective. People who are vaccinated have a far lower chance of being hospitalized. The single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine was found to be 66% effective at preventing COVID-19 2 weeks after vaccination. The Pfizer vaccine can help prevent deadlier variants of the virus, such as the Delta Variant.

Lawrence blockhouses

The Lawrence blockhouses were blockhouses built in the spring of 1864 in Lawrence, Kansas. They were built provide defensive buildings in case of attack by Confederate guerrillas. On August 21, 1863, William C. Quantrill led a group of 400 guerrillas and Confederate Army to attack Lawrence. Lawrence had few defenses. Much of the town was destroyed. About 180 men and boys were killed. A militia became active by spring 1864 to prevent another attack.

Five blockhouses were built by May 1864. One militia group was assigned to stay at each blockhouse. Each blockhouse was built out of logs. They had port holes to be used to aim rifles outside. It is unknown where all the blockhouses were at. One was somewhere in west Lawrence, and two may have been far from town. One was at the intersection of Massachusetts and Winthrop streets; another was at the intersection of Massachusetts and Berkley streets.

The exact places are known for only two of the blockhouses. These are:

Both Cordley and Ridenour said some people from the militia were assigned to stay at each blockhouse every night. In late October 1864, towns in Kansas were worried when Confederate Maj. Gen. Sterling Price came close to Kansas City from the east. On October 22, three of the five Lawrence militia groups were sent to the front. This left the other two to stay at the blockhouses and guard Lawrence.

On October 23, the people of Lawrence heard that the Union army attacking Price were defeated. There was nothing that could stop the Confederates from coming to Lawrence. However, on October 23, it was learned Price's men had been hurt, and they were going south. The two militia groups continued to stay at the blockhouses for about two weeks. The other three groups were busy with following the retreating Confederates.

The nightly guard duty and the use of the blockhouses continued until the end of the Civil War. After that time, nothing more was mentioned of the blockhouses.

Goddard, Kansas

Goddard is a city in Sedgwick County, Kansas, United States. It is a suburb of Wichita. In 2020, 5,084 people lived there.

In 1883, Ezekiel Wilder bought farmland on the planned railway of the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway south of Blendon, Kansas. It was about west of Wichita. There, he built the town of Goddard. It was named after J. F. Goddard, former third vice-president of the ATSF Railway. The railroad reached Goddard in 1884. A post office was built there the same year. Several buildings were moved from Blendon, including the town hall and the planned Methodist church. Goddard was officially incorporated in 1910.
