Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Cheshmah

Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah ( Taarak Mehta's inverted spectacles ) is one of India's longest running sitcoms. It is produced by Neela Tele Films Private Limited. The show went on air on 28 July 2008. It airs from Monday to Saturday on SAB TV. Reruns of the show started on Sony Pal from 2 November 2015.

The show is based on the column "Duniya Ne Undha Chashma" written by columnist and journalist/playwright Taarak Mehta for the Gujarati weekly magazine "Chitralekha".

Gokuldham Society is a residential society in Powder Galli, Goregaon East, Mumbai with four wings: A Wing, B Wing, C Wing and D Wing. Although the society has 17 flats, the show revolves around the lives of eight families. The residents are like one family :


There are also other recurring characters including Sundarlal (brother of Jethalal's wife Daya, from Ahmedabad, Gujarat) and his friends Baka and Bhailu. Abdul, the shopkeeper of the provision store located outside the society entrance, reporter Rita Shrivastav from 'Kal Tak' a news channel, Inspector Chalu Pandey, Asit Kumarr Modi as himself, Jethalal's shop assistants - Natwarlal Prabhashankar Udhaiwala (Natu Kaka), his nephew Bagheshwar Dadu Udhaiwala (Baagha), who are often bent on doing the wrong job and Baagha's fiancee Bawri Dhondulal Kanpuria.

The members of the society and other characters have a good psychological bond of love and sympathy for one another that makes them live like members of one family. They are often seen celebrating festivals and participating in events together. Although they are shown to live the lives of typical Indian families, the characters, more often than not Jethalal Gada, tend to find themselves in trouble, cropping up from routine activities that intensify in a comical manner.

The quirks of the individual characters seek to enhance the humour quotient of the show. Whatever the nature of the problem that a member of the society encounters, all the other members stand by them to extend every possible help. In an episode, the resolution of the problem that a character faces is usually followed by a moral message at the end by Taarak Mehta, which is meant for all the characters of the show as well as the viewers.



The major part of the shooting is done in Mumbai. However, some parts of the show have also been shot in places such as Gujarat, New Delhi, Goa and in foreign locations such as London, Brussels, Paris, Hong Kong and Singapore.

To celebrate "Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah" completing 1,000 episodes on 6 November 2012, the director "decided to shoot the film on a different canvas as he does not want the audience to feel that they are watching yet another episode of the serial."

In February 2015, Joshi, Vakani, and Lodha hosted the red carpet at the 60th Britannia Filmfare Awards to promote the "Clean India" campaign.

In the first week of 2017, the show stood in fourth position with 6,004 TVT ratings. In the fourth week, the show entered the top five and stood in fifth position with 6,059 TVT ratings. In March 2017, the show remained within the top five shows urban rural metrics. In the 25th week of 2017, the show stood at the top spot with 6,092 TVT ratings. In the 26th week of 2017, the show stood at third spot with 6,049 TVT ratings. It is the longest running scripted show on Indian television.In the 1st week of 2018 the show topped the trp chart with 6961 tvt ratings.

It flows from the Andean foothills to the Atlantic coast in a nearly west-to-east direction like the Amazon River. Seismic data and temperature variation with depth measured in 241 inactive oil wells helped find the aquifer.

Except for the flow direction, the Amazon and the Hamza have very different characteristics. The most obvious ones are their width and flow speed. While the Amazon is to wide, the Hamza is to in width. But the flow speed is in the Amazon and less than speed in the Hamza.

Several geological factors have played a vital role in the formation and existence of these subterranean water bodies. Water has worn away calcium carbonate rocks far under the ground. Water drops to great depths. East-west trending faults and the karst topography may have some role in supplying water to the "river".

The 153 km-long underground river in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula, and the 8.2 km-long Cabayugan River in the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park in the Philippines have come into being thanks to the karst topography. Water in these places has dissolved the carbonate rock to form extensive underground river systems.

Night service (public transport)

Nocturnal transportation is an all-encompassing name for public transportation that operates during the night. Nocturnal transport is operated by governments and municipalities, and operates mainly in large cities. Nocturnal transport is divided into two main types: urban nocturnal transport and inter-urban nocturnal transport. Urban night traffic is less common, and has flourished mainly in recent years. Transportation lines, which include mainly trams and buses, are usually marked with different numbers than usual, and their routes are also different, stopping at fewer stations. By contrast, inter-city night transport is very common, as many prefer to travel by train, for example, during the night, and arrive at their destination the next morning.

Break-open shotgun

A break-open shotgun is a type of shotgun that loads shotgun shells by opening up the barrels, taking out the spent shells, placing a new shell in each chamber, then closing the barrels. Most are either single- or double-barrel. Triple- and quadruple-barrel (three and four barrel) shotguns also exist, but single- and double-barrel shotguns are easier to make and less likely to jam. 

Most double-barrel shotguns are made with their barrels touching side-by-side. However, there are also shotguns where one barrel is on top of the other. Over-and-under shotguns are easier to aim than side-by-side shotguns because you do not need to aim a little to the left or right.

Since the metal cartridge was invented in 1845, most shotguns were break-open shotguns until the repeating shotgun was invented. Break-open shotguns are still popular with civilians because they are easier to use and less likely to jam than repeating shotguns; however, they hold fewer shells than repeating shotguns.

In early 2013, he released his debut single "Simple Life" through MCA Nashville. On August 19, 2016, White released "Spark", his debut album under Dot Records. It charted at No. 4 on the Top Country Albums chart. The album's third single, "Makin' Me Look Good Again", was released in 2016.

In January 2019, White was diagnosed with arteriovenous malformation (AVM), a rare vascular disease.

Arteriovenous malformation

Arteriovenous malformation is a rare disorder. It affects the areas between arteries and veins, and bypasses the capillary system. 

This happens in the central nervous system (usually cerebral AVM), but may appear in any location. The disease can cause intense pain or bleeding or lead to other serious medical problems such as cerebral hemorrhages or strokes.

AVMs are usually congenital. The genetic patterns of AVMs are incomplete, but there are known genetic mutations.

The general symptoms of a cerebral AVM include headaches and epileptic seizures. More specific symptoms occurring that normally depend on the place of the malformation.

Cerebral arteriovenous malformation

A cerebral arteriovenous malformation (cerebral AVM, CAVM, cAVM) is a rare connection between the arteries and veins in the brain. It is an arteriovenous malformation in the cerebrum.

In serious cases, the blood vessels rupture and there is bleeding within the brain (intracranial hemorrhage). Nevertheless, in more than half of patients with AVM, hemorrhage is the first symptom.

The most problems related to an AVM, are headaches and seizures, cranial nerve deficits, backaches, neckaches and eventual nausea.

Peter Ellis (childcare worker)

Peter Hugh McGregor Ellis (30 March 1958 – 4 September 2019) was a New Zealand childcare worker who was wrongly accused of child sexual abuse. He was a child care worker who worked in Christchurch. He was convicted in June 1993 and released from prison in February 2000. In October 2022 the Supreme Court of New Zealand said he had been wrongly accused and cleared him of all charges.

In June 1993, Ellis was found guilty in the High Court on 16 counts of sexual offences involving children in his care at the Christchurch Civic Creche and sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment. Many people have said he was wrongly accused, because of the way the children were interviewed and the way their interviews were shown to the jury. 

Many people believe in Ellis' innocence and many New Zealanders have supported his calls to overturn the conviction.

In 1994, the Court of Appeal removed convictions on three of the charges, but kept the sentence. His conviction and sentence were removed for a second time in the Court of Appeal in October 1999. Ellis refused to attend parole board hearings while in prison because he would have to confess to the crimes in order to argue for early release. He was released in February 2000 after serving seven years in prison.

Ellis has continued to campaign to clear his name. In 2019, he appealed to the Supreme Court to have his conviction removed from his background.

The Ellis case was one of many high profile child abuse cases around the world in the 1980s and early 1990s. It has been mentioned as a reason for the decrease in the number of male teachers in New Zealand schools.

In October 2022 the Supreme Court of New Zealand said he had been wrongly accused and cleared him of all charges, even though he had died in 2019.

Ellis was born in Christchurch. He was openly bisexual. 

On 26 July 2019, Ellis announced that he was diagnosed with terminal bladder cancer. He died on 4 September 2019 while appealing his conviction in Christchurch from the disease, aged 61.

2019 Brazil wildfires

The 2019 Brazil wildfires is the result of at least 75,336 wildfires occurred in the country since January 2019.

As of August 20, there are fires burning in the Amazon rainforest in four Brazilian states: Amazonas, Rondônia, Mato Grosso and Pará. At least 39,194 fires have been detected in Amazonas, which is the largest state in Brazil by area, and which has the "largest standing tracts of unbroken rainforest" in the world.

A state of emergency was declared by the government of Amazonas on August 11.

The federal government and President Jair Bolsonaro claims that the data on the numbers are "fake" and refuses to help end the fires or allow other countries to help.

In August, Bolsonaro said no one was allowed to set fires in the Amazon for 60 days. When someone wants to change rainforest land into a farm or other thing, first they cut down the trees and leave them there. Then they allow the land to dry. Then they set it on fire. So many of the trees were still killed because people could cut them down and wait to burn them until later.

Wildfires were also a problem on the Cerrado grassland, a place with many rare plants and animals. 40% of its animals do not live in any other place on Earth.


Yap

Yap or Wa′ab traditionally refers to an island in the Caroline Islands of the western Pacific Ocean, a part of the Federated States of Micronesia. The name "Yap" in recent years has come to also refer to the state within the Federated States of Micronesia, inclusive of the Yap Main Islands and its various outer islands.

The Yap Main Islands are considered to be made up of four separate islands: Yap Island proper ("Marbaq"), Gagil-Tamil, Maap, and Rumung. The four are contiguous, though separated by water, and are surrounded by a common coral reef. They are formed from an uplift of the Philippine Sea Plate, and are referred to as "high" islands as opposed to atolls. The land is mostly rolling hills, densely vegetated. Mangrove swamps line much of the shore, although there are beaches on the northern sides of the islands. Excluding the reef area, Yap is approximately 24 km long, 5–10 km wide, and 98 km. The highest elevation is at Mount Taabiywol in Fanif municipality on Yap island proper. The Yapese people's indigenous cultures and traditions are strong compared to other states in Micronesia.

Colonia is the capital of the State of Yap which includes the Yap Main Islands and the Yap Neighboring Islands—the outer islands (mostly atolls) reaching to the east and south from the Yap Main Islands for some 800 km (500 mi), namely the atolls of Eauripik, Elato, Faraulep, Gaferut, Ifalik, Lamotrek, Ngulu, Olimarao, Piagailoe (West Fayu), Pikelot, Sorol, Ulithi, and Woleai, as well as the islands of Fais and Satawal (see map). Historically, a tributary system existed between the Neighboring Islands and the Yap Main Islands. This probably related to the need for goods from the high islands, including food, as well as wood for construction of seagoing vessels.

In 2000 the population of Colonia and ten other municipalities totalled 11,241. The state has a total land area of .

Typhoon Krosa (2019)

Typhoon Krosa was a storm that affected Japan. It was the next typhoon after Lekima, in the 2019 Pacific typhoon season.

A tropical depression formed near Mariana Islands on August 5. By August 6, it intensified into a tropical storm, and was named Krosa by the JMA. Tropical Storm Krosa soon became a typhoon, and rapidly intensified to become a category 3-equivalent typhoon on August 8. Upwelling of cooler waters induced weakening thereafter; by August 13, Krosa weakened below typhoon intensity. Krosa continued moving, albeit slowly, towards Japan with little change in intensity. Moderately conducive conditions were unable to aid Krosa in strengthening, and it stayed the same intensity before landfall in Japan. On August 14, Krosa emerged in the Sea of Japan and a few days later on August 16 Krosa transitioned into an extratropical low.

The typhoon brought torrential rain to parts of Shikoku and Honshu, with accumulations peaking at at Yanase in Kochi Prefecture. Wind gusts reached in Muroto. Rough seas produced by the storm killed two people while flooding killed one other. Fifty-five people were injured in various incidents. Agricultural damage in Japan reached ¥279.61 million (US$2.64 million).

However, it is not known whether he was referring to rapes or cannibalization, nor is it known if the statement was truthful. Fish was a suspect in at least five murders during his lifetime. Fish confessed to three murders that police were able to trace to a known murder, and he confessed to stabbing at least two other people. He was put on trial for the kidnapping and murder of Grace Budd, and was convicted and executed by electric chair at Sing Sing. His last words were, "I don't even know why I'm here."

Fish was known to stab himself with pins, as could be seen from X-rays. He was also known to eat his own feces. Fish supposedly ate the penis of at least one of his victims.

Due to modus operandi, his crimes were sometimes confused with those of nearby serial killer Peter Kudzinowski.

Mac OS X Public Beta

Mac Os X Public Beta is a Operating System of Apple Computers which are Developed by Apple Inc. Which is later on Updated to the version Mac OS X 10.0

The Mac OS X Public Beta was an early, test version of the Mac OS X operating system released to the public in late 2000 for USD $30. Hardcore Macintosh fans could therefore get a taste of the upcoming operating system before its final release. It was named Kodiak internally by Apple. The name was not publicly used.

The Public Beta was the first time people could use the Aqua interface. Virtually everything was new in the operating system: fonts, the Dock, even the menu bar (with an Apple logo at the centre, which was later repositioned). The icons exploded in size, and new OS eye candy was all the rage.

As it was a public beta, this version was not without its bugs and inconveniences. Apple used user feedback to improve upon the OS, so that a vastly improved Golden Master version of Mac OS X was ready for release by March 2001.

The Public Beta version came with a price tag, and a time limit (set for May 15, 2001). In spite of all these shortcomings, it was still welcomed by the Mac community, with people eager to test drive the new OS.

The Public Beta was superseded by Mac OS X 10.0.0, the first final release of Mac OS X.

Zorro

Zorro, Spanish for fox, is the name used by a fictional Mexican-era California masked hero and master swordsman of the Old West. 

In the stories, his real name is Don Diego De La Vega who fights for the people against the corrupt tyranny of Govenor Montero where he proves to be much too foxlike and cunning for the bumbling authorities to catch.

The first Zorro story was a 1919 novel, "The Curse of Capistrano", by Johnston McCulley. He soon becomes a regular character in pulp fiction magazines. McCulley was inspired by the story of the real bandit Salomon Pico and other real Mexican bandits who robbed Americans after the Mexican-American War. However, because his readers were Americans, McCulley had his Zorro fighting Spanish people instead of Americans.

The character has been also adapted for numerous movies, the most famous of which include:

There was one parody movie in 1981, "", which starred George Hamilton.

There were also numerous television shows with the best known one being one shown in the 1950s staring Guy Williams.

Foot odor

Foot odor (or foot odour) is a type of body odor that affects the feet of humans. Some people think it is an unpleasant smell. Others may enjoy it when they have a foot fetish or olfactophilia (being attracted to certain smells). A 1994 study found that 45% of people with a foot fetish were also aroused by smelly socks and/or feet.

The main cause of foot odor is foot sweat. Sweat itself does not smell a lot, but some bacteria can grow better in a sweaty environment, which then cause the odor. These bacteria are normally on our skin and are not harmful. 

The front part of the foot produces the most sweat. 

Sweating on the feet can be increased by wearing closed shoes or boots. Especially thick materials such as leather or rubber will hold the sweat in them and can increase the odor intensity. Certain types of socks can also make the smell stronger.

The quality (aroma) of foot odor is often described as thick and smelling like cheese. This is because some of the bacteria that create foot odor (like "Brevibacteria") are also used in the production of cheese. They produce the chemical "3-Methylbutanoic acid," which is a main part that is responsible for the odor. This chemical is also often used to make perfumes.

Because of acids in the foot sweat, the odor may also be sour, similar to that of vinegar.

Other things that can influence foot smell are the type of socks and shoes a person wears, how long they are worn at a time, and many individual factors, for example if the person does a lot of sports or other physical activities. Because men sweat more than women, they generally have smellier feet.

The best method for preventing food odor is to maintain a good foot hygiene. Regular cleaning of the feet removes dead skin cells from the feet, along with sebum (a type of body oil). This reduces the opportunities for bacteria to cause smelly feet. By regularly cleaning feet properly, feet will not have a strong foot odor. A foot file or pumice stone can be used to remove dead skin cells.

Iñigo Manterola Ondarra

Iñigo Manterola Ondarra (born 1973 in Orlo) is a Spanish painter and Basque sculptor.

Iñigo Manterola was born in Orio in 1973. He was born in a familiar core of sailor tradition. Since he was little showed a lot of interest by the drawing and the painting. When he had only 8 years old, his teacher spoke with his mother and aimed him to extracurricular classes of painting. Because of this passion by the art , Iñigo starts his studies of painting in the Faculty of Fine arts in Bilbao between 1993 and 1998, licensing in the speciality of painting.

After finishing his studies, Iñigo made diverse workshops between which stand out, on the one hand the workshop of MASTER painting OF THE FIGURACIÓN, together with Antonio López García and Juan José Aquerreta , in the School of Architecture of Pamplona in 2006. On the other hand, the workshop TEXTURES, given by the Australian artist David Kelly with reason o the exhibition AUSTRALIS in the room Kubokutxa of Donostia- San Sebastián in 2010.

Besides, we can stand out a lot of projects during his artistic path, as well as "Way between two waters", of the figuración to the abstraction ,in 2005, multidisciplinary exhibition that presented to the Gallery ISPILU of Zarautz as in Madrid in the gallery JOVENART. In 2007 Animated Paintings, a seasickness in the Bay of Biscay, in the gallery 3And of Bilbao. In the year 2011 made a project beside the artist Gorka Larrañaga, Txantxareatzen  that consisted in making a plastic exercise between both with his back exhibition in the gallery THE HOUSE in Mexico D.F. In the year 2016, made RTRAZO, X-ray of a gesture agonizante, in the room POLVORÍN of the Citadel of Pamplona, that later travelled to the gallery ENELESTUDIO of San Sebastián.

If there is something that stand out in the path of Iñigo is his constant and vital evolution. The need to go burning stages and to present new proposals is tangible. After devoting him 15 years exclusively to the painting, began to incorporate in his projects another type of disciplines like the sculpture, the photography and the installation, with spirit to go growing in his work.

Iñigo has been able to expose more than 50 individual exhibitions and 20 collective ,in cities like San Sebastián , Vitoria, Pamplona, Bilbao, Valencia, Seville, Madrid, Barcelona, Biarritz, Mexico D.F , Port wine, Abu Dabi etc., in all has been able to see his evolution. Recently, Iñigo has incorporated the resin to make his pieces and also the dibond like support in his paintings, specifically in the series Rtrazo.

Besides, on 21 June of the 2019, Iñigo inaugurated his new study in Zarautz.

As Iñigo was born in a family of sailor tradition, his thematic shows prompt to the balcony of the pesqueros of bajura, the arrantzales and the bustle of the port. And it has not changed until today, I save in his exercises, that submerge it by a time in the language no figurativo. Also Manterola has worked the sculpture, converting each piece in an only piece using different materials so much the iron , steel cut ,copper , iron galvanised , nylon, stainless steel, resin or iron painted.

Another of the appearances to stand out of Manterola is that it believes in the synergies and in the collaborations with other artists and disciplines. It says that it exists a mutual enrichment in all maridaje. Proof of this are the exercises with artists like Gorka Larrañaga and Samuel Dougados, the project "UNYON" beside Ivory Jewellers and, more recently, the collaboration with the chef French , that has 3 stars Michelin, for the one who has designed the servilleteros of his restaurant of Paris and where in each table luce one of his sculptures.

Robert J. Walker

Robert John Walker (July 19, 1801November 11, 1869) was an American lawyer, economist and politician. He was in the Democratic Party. He was a senator from Mississippi from 1835 until 1845. He was the Secretary of the Treasury from 1845 to 1849 under President James K. Polk. He was the Territorial Governor of Kansas in 1857.

President Polk asked Walker to become U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. Walker was the Treasury Secretary during all of Polk's presidency (from March 8, 1845 until March 5, 1849).

As Treasury Secretary, Walker was responsible for financing the Mexican–American War. However, he did not do a very good job.

In 1853, President Franklin Pierce asked Walker if he wanted to be the United States Minister to China, but Walker said no.

He was chosen to be governor of Kansas Territory on May 27, 1857 by President James Buchanan. However, he quit in December 1857. He quit because of he didn't agree with the Lecompton Constitution. In a to Secretary of State Lewis Cass dated December 15, 1857, he said his reasons for quitting was because clear voting fraud and improper political pressure from Franklin Pierce's administration.

Lecompton Constitution

The Lecompton Constitution (1857) was one of four proposed constitutions for the state of Kansas. It was written by pro-slavery people. It included parts to allow slavery in the state. It also had parts to not include free blacks from its bill of rights. It was defeated on January 4, 1858 by a majority of voters in the Kansas Territory. The rejection of the Lecompton Constitution, and the admission of Kansas to the Union as a free state, showed the unusual and fraudulent voting practices. These practices had been used in earlier efforts by bushwhackers and border ruffians to create a state constitution in Kansas that allowed slavery.

The Topeka Constitution was written before the Lecompton Constitution. The Leavenworth and Wyandotte Constitutions were written after the Lecompton Constitution. The Wyandotte Consitution became the Kansas state constitution. The document was written in response to the anti-slavery 1855 Topeka Constitution. That constitution was written by James H. Lane and other free-state people. The territorial legislature was filled mostly with slave owners. They met at the chosen capital of Lecompton in September 1857. They met there to write a document that would compete against the other constitutions. Most actual settlers were anti-slavery. They [boycott]ed the vote. Territorial governor of Kansas, Robert J. Walker, was very pro-slavery. However, he was against the obvious unfairness of the Constitution. He quit being governor so he did not have to enforce it.

President James Buchanan was very pro-slavery, so he supported the Lecompton Constitution when it was sent to Congress. The president received the support of the Southern Democrats. However, many Northern Democrats, led by Stephen A. Douglas, voted with the Republicans to be against the constitution.


Dalmatian language

Dalmatian was a Romance language, which was spoken in Dalmatia, on the Eastern Adriatic Sea. The language became extinct in the Middle Ages. In places it was used until the 18th or 19th century. Today, few sources are left. Only the dialect of Veglia (Krk) and Ragusa (Dubrovnik) have enough sources so they can be studied. From the other dialects, there are only isloate words, or short phrases. 

In 1897, the scholar Matteo Bartoli, himself a native of nearby Istria, visited postman Tuone Udaina (), nicknamed "burbur" ('barber' in Dalmatian) the last known speaker of any Dalmatian dialect, to study his language. Bartoli wrote down approximately 2,800 words, stories, and accounts of his life, which were published in a book in German ("") in 1906. That book has provided much information on the vocabulary, phonology, and grammar of the language. 

One year after the interview, on 10 June 1898, Tuone Udaina was accidentally killed at 74 in a roadwork explosion.

Arhat

An arhat is a type of enlightened person in Buddhism. They have achieved enlightenment by following the teachings of a Buddha. Many of the Buddha's disciples became arhats. 

The importance of the arhat is different depending on the Buddhist school. 

The aim of becoming an arhat is to seek perfect calm and understanding in one's mind. 

"Arhat" is a Sanskrit word. It means "someone who deserves to be to honored."

The ultimate goal in Theravada Buddhism is to become an arhat. Someone who becomes an arhat is the same as someone who attains enlightenment. The Buddha is also sometimes called an "arhat."

In Mahayana Buddhism, bodhisattvas are seen as better than arhats. A bodhisattva will eventually become a Buddha, who can teach all living beings. An arhat can teach too, but only achieves enlightenment for him or herself.


Nāga

A naga is a type of deity in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. 
They are snake gods that live in the ocean and underground in an underworld called "Patala." They can sometimes appear in human form. There are three main forms:
A female naga is called a "nagi" or "nagini". A "nagaraja" is a king of the nagas. They are common in Indian mythology and play an important role in many religious traditions.

"Naga" (नाग; nāga) is a Sanskrit word that means "cobra." The word is sometimes also used to refer to any kind of snake.

Nagas are very common in Hindu mythology and art. They are described as a proud and powerful race of semi-divine beings that can take on many forms. They live in an enchanted underworld filled with jewels, gold and other treasures. This world is called “Naga-loka” or “Patala-loka”. The nagas are guardians of treasure and keepers of magic. They are often seen in bodies of water such as lakes and oceans. 

Their power and venom is potentially dangerous to humans. However, many nagas are benevolent, such as in the story called Samudra manthan, where the Nagaraja Vasuki who lays on Shiva's neck becomes a rope used by the gods and asuras for churning the Ocean of Milk. 

The nagas’ eternal enemies are the garudas, a bird-like deity.
Vishnu is often portrayed resting under Shesha’s hood or laying on Shesha, but this symbolism can be found among other deities too. The serpent is commonly seen in art featuring Ganesha. 

Nagas are a common deity in Buddhism. They usually appear in the form of a giant cobra, with one head or many heads. Sometimes nagas will use their magic powers to transform into human form. They are often called "dragons" in English and are understood across Asia as being the same as dragons. It is believed that nagas live both underground in their own world and in the world of humans. Some live in the earth in places like caves and caverns while others live in water such as oceans and lakes.

The nagas are the followers of Virupaksha one of the Four Heavenly Kings. They are also guardians on Mount Sumeru and protect the devas of Trayastrimsha heaven from the asuras.

There is a story of a naga who appeared in human form so that he could become a Buddhist monk. The Buddha told him that only humans were allowed to become monks. The naga took the five precepts so that he could be reborn as a human in a future life.

There is also an episode in the "Lotus Sutra" where the eight year old daughter of the dragon king transforms into a male bodhisattva and then becomes enlightened. This story may be a reference to the idea that a person must have a male body in order to become a Buddha.

One popular naga in Buddhism is Mucalinda, who is a Naga King and protector of the Buddha. In the Vinaya Sutra, King Mucalinda uses his hood and seven heads to shelter the Buddha from a storm. Then the king takes the form of a young Brahmin and worships the Buddha.

According to tradition, Nāgārjuna was given the Prajñapāramita sutras by nagas who were guarding them after the Buddha left the world.

Dhritarashtra

Dhritarashtra (Sanskrit: धृतराष्ट्र, "Dhṛtarāṣṭra") or Dhatarattha (Pali: धतरट्ठ "Dhataraṭṭha") is one of the Four Heavenly Kings and an important person in Buddhism. 
The name Dhṛtarāṣṭra comes from two Sanskrit words: "dhṛta" (possessing; bearing) and "rāṣṭra" (kingdom; territory).

Dhṛtarāṣṭra is the guardian god of the East. He lives on the eastern part of Mount Sumeru. He is leader of the gandharvas and the pishacas.

He is often shown in art playing a stringed instrument.

In the Pāli writings of the Theravada Buddhist tradition, Dhṛtarāṣṭra is called "Dhataraṭṭha". Dhataraṭṭha is one of the Four Great Kings, each one of which rules over a direction. Vessavaṇa's direction is the eastern quarter of the world. 

He has many sons called "Indra." He also has a daughter named "Sirī".

In Japan, Jikokuten (持国天) is often shown wearing a suit of armor. He usually holds a sword and a trident while standing on top of a demon called a "jaki".

The trail was opened in February 2019, the 500th anniversary of Leonardo's death. It goes through places that were important in the life and art of Leonardo.

The other half goes between Pavia and San Bernardino along the western side of Lake Como. The trail is 540 kilometers long in total. It takes 26 days to walk both halves.

Alessandro Manzoni and Leonardo da Vinci are numerous and it seems that their families knew each other.
The Last Supper inside the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie in nearby Milan sees the profiles of its characters perfectly matching the profiles of Monte Resegone on Lake Como.

Numerous symbols and emblems in local churches of the Lierna Lake Como area and other medieval structures also lead explorers to discover the important role of the Knights Templar in this region, including indications that Leonardo's painting may have served as a mysterious map to a secret passage in a area of ​​the Grigna mountain range known as Alpe di Campione.

The rock formations, caves, waterfalls and breathtaking views of the Grigna massif and the surrounding Lierna mountains on Lake Como deeply inspired Leonardo da Vinci's development.

Significant places for Leonardo da Vinci on Lake Como:

Porta Romana (Milan)

Porta Romana ("Roman Gate") is a former city gate of Milan, Italy. In its present form, the gate dates back to the 16th century Spanish walls of Milan.

Sexagesimal

Sexagesimal (base 60) is a number system with sixty as its base. It was invented by the ancient Sumerians in the 3rd millennium BC. It was passed down to the ancient Babylonians, and it is still used—in a modified form—for measuring time, angles, and geographic coordinates.

The number 60 is a composite number. It has twelve factors, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60, of which 2, 3, and 5 are prime numbers. 

Therefore, using sexagesimal numbers, fractions are simplified. For example, one hour can be divided evenly into sections of 30 minutes, 20 minutes, 15 minutes, 12 minutes, 10 minutes, 6 minutes, 5 minutes, 4 minutes, 3 minutes, 2 minutes, and 1 minute. 

60 is the smallest number that is divisible by every number from 1 to 6; that is, it is the lowest common multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Note: here in this article, all sexagesimal digits are represented as decimal numbers. For example, "10" means the number ten and "60" means the number sixty.

He was a candidate for the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination in 2000, as well as a candidate for the United States Senate election in Virginia in 2002. He was born in Laredo, Texas.

In April 2019, Hornberger was seen as a possible 2020 candidate for the Libertarian nomination. On October 23, 2019, he filed to run for the Libertarian Party 2020 presidential primary. Though Hornberger won the most primaries and received the most votes, Jo Jorgensen was chosen as the party's presidential nominee on the night of May 23, 2020, after four rounds of voting.

In February 2023, Hornberger announced his third presidential candidacy for the 2024 election.

Jacob grew up on a farm on the Rio Grande near Laredo, Texas, which at the time was the poorest city in the United States. His father was German-American and his mother was Mexican-American.

Jacob Hornberger received a bachelor's degree in economics from the Virginia Military Institute, and a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Texas.

Jacob Hornberger was an attorney in the state of Texas for twelve years. Hornberger was an adjunct professor at the University of Dallas, teaching economics and law. Hornberger stopped practicing law in 1987 to become the director of programs for the Foundation for Economic Education. Since then, he has been an advocate for free markets and founded the Future of Freedom Foundation.

In early 1999, Hornberger formed an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian nomination for president in 2000. Two months later, Hornberger withdrew from the race. Harry Browne, who had been the 1996 Libertarian nominee for president, was running for the nomination in 2000 and was considered the frontrunner. Hornberger began publishing essays criticizing Browne for not being committed to libertarian principles, alleging that Browne was running a "Republican-lite" campaign.

Then, a week before the 2000 Libertarian National Convention, Hornberger rejoined the race for the presidential nomination. At the convention, Hornberger focused most of his messaging on the criticisms of Browne he had been publishing in the previous year. Browne secured the nomination on the first ballot with 56.15% of the vote, while Hornberger finished in third place with 13.67% of the vote.

During the 2000 Libertarian presidential primary, Hornberger published an essay titled "Lord Acton Was Right: A Response to David Bergland: Part 3 (of 3)". In it, Hornberger accused then-candidate for chair of the Libertarian National Committee Jim Lark of silencing a presidential candidate, Don Gorman, during the Libertarian Party of Virginia's state convention. Hornberger also detailed a conversation he had overheard between Lark and Gorman that supported these accusations. Both Lark and Gorman, as well as others, denied this conversation happening. Hornberger acknowledged this two years later in an essay titled "Correction and Apology." 

Shortly after this essay was published, Hornberger announced his intent to run for senate in Virginia as a Libertarian. Lark, as well as other members of the Libertarian Party of Virginia, expressed opposition to Hornberger's candidacy, citing his false accusations against them from 2000. Hornberger requested that the Libertarian Party of Virginia assist his campaign in collecting ballot access signatures, but the party denied since Hornberger had not been formally nominated as the party's candidate yet. Hornberger then decided to instead run as an independent in the 2002 Virginia senate race.

In the general election, Hornberger was one of three candidates who qualified for the ballot, alongside Republican incumbent John Warner and independent Nancy Spannaus, a Lyndon LaRouche movement activist; there was no Democrat challenger. Hornberger finished in third place with 106,055 votes and 7.1% of the popular vote.

In April 2019, Hornberger was seen as a possible 2020 candidate for the Libertarian nomination. On October 29, 2019 Hornberger officially filed to run for president as a Libertarian Shortly after he released a YouTube video announcing his candidacy, expressing a view that the candidates in the race before him were insufficiently committed to abolishing Medicare. Hornberger began his campaign by focusing on the North Carolina primary, declaring his intent to win the vote on March 3rd.

Editorial

An editorial, leading article (US) or leader (UK), is an article written by the senior editors of a newspaper or magazine. The article is often unsigned. Australian and major United States newspapers, such as "The New York Times" and "The Boston Globe", often give editorials the heading "opinion".

Editorials can also be in the form of a cartoon.

The editors decide on which issues their readers will want to know the newspaper's opinion.

Editorials are usually published on a special page, called the editorial page. This often features letters to the editor from members of the public. The page opposite this page is called the op-ed page (opposite the editorial); and has opinion pieces by writers not employed by the publication. However, a newspaper may choose to publish an editorial on the front page. In the English-language press, this occurs rarely and only on topics considered very important; it is more common, however, in some European countries such as Spain, Italy, and France.

Many newspapers do not put the name of the author on the editorial. Tom Clark, editorial writer for "The Guardian", argues that it helps readers discuss the issue, not the author. On the other hand, an editorial does reflect the position of a newspaper and the head of the newspaper, the editor, is known by name. Whilst the editor will often not write the editorial themselves, they maintain oversight and retain responsibility.

When "The Press", a New Zealand newspaper based in Christchurch, changed after 157 years from broadsheet to compact in 2018, they published a list of editorials where current thinking differs from opinions expressed at the time. One example was the change in their view on women's suffrage in New Zealand. The government gave women the vote in 1893, and the editorial said that women would "much prefer staying at home and attending to their household duties" than going to the polling booths.

In fashion publishing, the term is often used to refer to "photo"-editorials. These are often full-page photographs on a particular theme, designer, model or other single topic, with or (as in a photo-essay) without accompanying text.

Instead of just performing ballet classics, they had their six dancers dance new ballets by Joffrey. The troupe first performed in a major city in Chicago in 1957. The Joffrey Ballet originally settled in New York City, where joffrey was teaching dance to pay for the company. At that time, it was called the Robert Joffrey Theatre Ballet. The company began touring internationally in 1962. They first toured in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. In 1963, the company performed in the USSR. After some troubles, Joffrey built the company anew in 1965. 

The new company was called the Joffrey Ballet. Following a successful season at the New York City Center in 1966, it was invited to become City Center's resident ballet company with Joffrey as artistic director and Arpino as chief choreographer. In 1973 Joffrey asked Twyla Tharp to create her first commissioned ballet, "Deuce Coupe". The company continued as City Center Joffrey Ballet until 1977. From 1977, it performed as the Joffrey Ballet, with a second home in Los Angeles from (1982-1992). In 1995, the company left New York City and moved to Chicago. At first, the Joffrey had financial difficulties in Chicago. But then it became successful. In 2005 the Joffrey Ballet celebrated its 10th anniversary in Chicago. In 2006 and 2007, it held two-season-long 50th anniversary celebrations. The celebrations included "River to River" tour of free, outdoor performances across Iowa, sponsored by Hancher Auditorium at the University of Iowa.

In 2007 Gerald Arpino retired from day-to-day operations, becoming artistic director emeritus until his death in 2009. In October 2007 former Joffrey dancer Ashley Wheater, assistant artistic director and ballet master for San Francisco Ballet, became the third artistic director.

In 2020, the company was one of a number of Chicago cultural organizations to receive financial support as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic/ That same year, the Joffrey canceled its entire 2020 season due to the pandemic. "In addition, the Joffrey Academy of Dance, Official School of The Joffrey Ballet, and Joffrey Community Engagement . . . shifted to virtual programming until further notice."

Cradle of civilization

A cradle of civilization is a place where civilization emerged. There was no single "cradle", but several civilizations that developed independently. The Fertile Crescent (Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia), Ancient India, and Ancient China were the first. Whether there was influence between the early civilizations of the Near East and those of East Asia is not known. 

Scholars accept that the civilizations of Mesoamerica emerged independently and later than those in Eurasia. They were mainly in modern Mexico, and Norte Chico, in the north-central coastal region of Peru.

Civilization involves the use of writing, building cities, a class-based society, agriculture, animal husbandry, public buildings, metallurgy, and monumental architecture. The term "cradle of civilization" has been applied to a variety of cultures and areas, in particular the Ancient Near Eastern Chalcolithic and Fertile Crescent, Ancient India and Ancient China. It has also been applied to ancient Anatolia, the Levant and Iranian plateau, and used to refer to culture predecessors—such as Ancient Greece as the predecessor of Western civilization.

Eocene–Oligocene extinction event

The end of the Eocene was the beginning of the Oligocene (33.9 million years ago). It is marked by a large-scale floral and faunal turnover. 

Most of the affected organisms were marine or aquatic in nature. They included the last of the ancient cetaceans, the Archaeoceti.

This was a time of major climatic change, especially cooling. At first, it was not linked with any single major impact or any catastrophic volcanic event. 

But volcanic activity may have caused the extinction event. Several large meteorite impacts occurred about this time. One such event caused the Chesapeake Bay impact crater , and another at the Popigai crater in central Siberia, scattering debris perhaps as far as Europe. New dating of the Popigai meteor suggests it may be a cause of the mass extinction.

A leading scientific theory on climate cooling at this time predicts a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide, which slowly declined in the mid to late Eocene and possibly reached some threshold about 34 million years ago. This boundary is closely linked with the Oligocene Oi-1 event, an oxygen isotope change which marks the beginning of ice sheet coverage on Antarctica.

Professor Moriarty

Professor James Moriarty is a fictional character in some of the Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Moriarty is a criminal mastermind whom Holmes describes as the "Napoleon of crime". 

Doyle got the phrase from a Scotland Yard inspector. The inspector was referring to a real-life criminal. The character was introduced to allow Doyle to kill Sherlock Holmes, and only featured in two of the Sherlock Holmes stories. Later, he has often been treated as Holmes' archenemy.

Professor Moriarty's first and only appearance occurred in "The Adventure of the Final Problem". There Holmes is about to deliver a fatal blow to Moriarty's criminal organization. Suddenly he is forced to flee to continental Europe to escape Moriarty's revenge. Moriarty follows. 

The pursuit ends in Switzerland on top of the Reichenbach Falls. The encounter that apparently ends with both Holmes and Moriarty falling to their deaths.

Early in the relationship, Dr Watson becomes engaged to marry Miss Mary Morstan, a former client of Sherlock Holmes (see "The Sign of Four"). Later it seems Watson's fiancée has apparently died.

Edmund Kean

Edmund Kean (4 November 1787 – 15 May 1833) was a British Shakespearean stage actor born in England.

Kean was born in Westminster, London. His father was Edmund Kean, an architect’s assistant, and his mother, Anne Carey, was an actress. His mother was the daughter of the 18th-century composer and playwright Henry Carey.

Kean starting acting at the age of four, as a Cupid in Jean-Georges Noverre’s ballet of "Cymon". As a child, his cheerfulness made him a universal favourite, but his background and lack of discipline, helped him develop independence and stubborn habits. In 1794, a few kind-hearted people paid for his school fees. Even though he did well in school, he found it unbearable. As such, he decided to work as a cabin boy at Portsmouth. Finding life at sea even more limiting, he pretended to be deaf and lame so skilfully that he managed to trick the doctors at Madeira.

After returning to England, he requested for the protection of his uncle, Moses Kean, an entertainer, who introduced Kean to the study of Shakespeare. At the same time, Miss Charlotte Tidswell, an actress who had been especially kind to him since he was young, taught him the basics of acting.

When his uncle died, Miss Charlotte was responsible in looking after Kean, and he began studying the main characters of Shakespeare. Kean displayed the creativeness of his mind by acting in a very different way from John Philip Kemble, an actor for many Shakespearean characters. A Mrs Clarke adopted Kean for his talents and appearance, but he was upset about a visitor's comments and suddenly left her house and went back to Miss Charlotte.

At the young age of 14, Kean was hired to act as main characters for 20 nights in the York Theatre, acting as Hamlet, Hastings and Cato. While he was at Richardson's Theatre, a travelling theatre company, the news of his talents reached George III, who ordered him to be at Windsor Castle. Kean later joined Saunders's circus, where while performaning as a horse rider, he fell and broke both legs. The accident left swelling on his foot throughout his life.

Kean learned music from Charles Incledon, dancing from D’Egville, and fencing from Angelo. 

In 1807, he had a chance to act in leading parts at the Belfast theatre with Sarah Siddons, who began by calling him "a horrid little man" and changed to saying that he "played very, very well," but that "there was too little of him to make a great actor" after seeing his abilities.

The next year, Kean joined Samuel Butler's provincial troupe and went on to marry Mary Chambers of Waterford, a leading actress, on 17 July. His wife gave birth to two sons, one of whom was actor Charles Kean.

For several years, Kean's career had little chances to grow. But in 1814, the committee of Drury Lane Theatre, which was about to go bankrupt, decided to give Kean a chance among the "experiments" they were making to gain more popularity. When the hope of his first appearance in London got higher, he was so nervous that he exclaimed, "If I succeed I shall go mad." As he was unable to pay for his elder son's medical treatment for some time, his son died the day after Kean signed the three-year Drury Lane contract.

His appearance at the Drury Lane Theatre on 26 January 1814 as Shylock left the audience enthusiastic. People recognised that Kean had brought self-respect and humanity to his role of the character. Jane Austen refered to his popularity in a letter she wrote to her sister, Cassandra, on 2 March 1814: "Places are secured at Drury
Lane for Saturday, but so great is the rage for seeing Kean that only a third and fourth row could be got". 
Appearances in "Richard III", "Hamlet", "Othello", "Macbeth" and "King Lear" demonstrated his ability to control his range of emotions. His joy was so great that he himself said, "I could not feel the stage under me."
In 1817, Charles Bucke, a local playwright, submitted his play "The Italians, or; The Fatal Accusation" to Drury Lane, for which Kean was to play the main role. The play was well received by everyone until Kean said that his part was too small for him. Then, after a performance in February 1819 where Kean went to make a mess at the opening night of "Switzerland" by historical novelist Jane Porter, for whom Kean had had a personal dislike, Bucke pulled the play out of disrespect for Kean's actions.

After much persuasion to still perform the play by the theater staff, Mr. Bucke then later had it republished with a introduction concerning the incident, including parts of conversation between the involved parties, which was later questioned in two books, "The Assailant Assailed" and "A Defense of Edmund Kean, Esq." The result was embarassment on both sides and the play being performed anyway on 3 April 1819 to a terrible reception thanks to the dispute already surrounding the play and Kean's previous conduct.

On 29 November 1820, Kean appeared for the first time in New York City as Richard III. The success of his visit to America was unmistakable, although he fell into a annoying dispute with the news media. In 1821, Kean appeared in Boston with Mary Ann Duff in "The Distrest Mother", by Ambrose Philips, an adaptation of Racine's Andromaque. On 4 June 1821, he returned to England.

Kean was the first to fix the terrible ending to Shakespeare's "King Lear", which had been replaced on stage since 1681 by Nahum Tate's happy ending adaptation "The History of King Lear". Kean had previously acted as Tate's Lear, but told his wife that the London audience "have no notion of what I can do till they see me over the dead body of Cordelia." Kean played as Lear for a few performances. They were not well received, though one critic described his dying scene as "deeply affecting", and with regret, he changed back to Tate.

Kean's lifestyle disrupted his career. As a result of his relationship with Charlotte Cox, the wife of a London city council member, Kean was sued by Mr Cox for criminal conversation (adultery). Kean was ordered to pay £800 to Mr Cox by a jury that only discussed for just 10 minutes. "The Times" launched a violent attack on him. The decision in the criminal conversation case of Cox v. Kean on 17 January 1825 caused his wife to leave him, and caused him to have such bitter feeling that he was boo-ed and attacked with fruits when he re-appeared at Drury Lane and nearly decided to retire permanently into private life. For many years, he lived at Keydell House, Horndean.

The purpose of Kean's second visit to America in 1825 was due to the repeated abuse he suffered in England. Some cities showed him a spirit of charity; many audiences submitted him to insults and even violence. In Quebec City, he was amazed with the kindness of some Huron Indians who went to his performances. He was made an honorary (unofficial) chief of the tribe, receiving the name "Alanienouidet". Kean's last appearance in New York was on 5 December 1826 in "Richard III", playing the same role in which he first acted in America.

When Kean returned to England, he was received with favour in the end. However, his heavy reliance on the use of stimulants caused him his talents. Still, his great powers was successful during the moments of his creativity over the absolute ruin of his physical potential. His appearance in Paris was a failure due to being drunk.

His last appearance on the stage was at Covent Garden on 15 March 1833, when he played in "Othello. When saying "Villain, be sure," in scene 3 of act iii, Kean suddenly started crying in a stammered voice "O God, I am dying. Speak to them, Charles," fell unconscious into his son, Charles Kean's, arms. He died in Surrey in 1833, and is honoured in the Parish Church where there is a memorial tablet on the floor, marking his grave and a wall plaque originally on the outside but moved inside and heavily restored during restoration work in 1904. He is buried in the parish church of All Saints, in the village of Catherington, Hampshire. His last words were claimed to have been "dying is easy; comedy is hard." In Dublin, Gustavus Vaughan Brooke acted as William Tell after Kean's death.

As stated in the "Encyclopædia Britannica" Eleventh Edition, it was in the impression of the great creations of Shakespeare's fine mind that the varied beauty and magnificence of the acting of Kean were displayed in their highest form, although probably his most powerful character was Sir Giles Overreach in Philip Massinger’s "A New Way to Pay Old Debts", the effect of his first performance of which was such that the pit rose altogether, and even the actors and actresses themselves were defeated by the terrific dramatic illusion. His main disadvantage as an actor was his height. Coleridge said, "Seeing him act was like reading Shakespeare by flashes of lightning."

His strangeness at the height of his fame were numerous. Sometimes he would carelessly ride on his horse, Shylock, throughout the night. He was offered a tame lion with which he might be found playing in his drawing-room.

Prize-fighters Mendoza and Richmond the Black were among his visitors and Henry Grattan was his loyal friend.

In his earlier days, François Talma said of Kean, "He is a magnificent uncut gem; polish and round him off and he will be a perfect tragedian." William Macready, who was amazed by Kean's "Richard III", met the actor at supper, speaks of his "unassuming manner ... partaking in some degree of shyness" and of the "touching grace" of his singing. Kean's way of saying "I answer—No!" while acting as Sir Edward Mortimer in "The Iron Chest", made Macready know that he had no chance of getting the role from Kean. Kean's life was so full of dramatic interest that it was the subject (topic) for the play "Kean" by Jean-Paul Sartre as well as a play by Alexandre Dumas, entitled "Kean, ou Désordre et génie", where actor Frédérick Lemaître achieved one of his greatest success. In 1924, director Alexandre Volkoff made play by Alexandre Dumas into a French silent feature film with Russian actor Ivan Mosjoukine, who was then living in Paris, as the lead actor.

Quite a number of theatrical works have been based on Kean's life, such as:

Peter O'Toole, a well-known 20th century British theatre and film actor, owned a ring that had once belonged to Kean, and he used the ring as a muse (insipration) for the writing of the second part of his autobiography "Loitering With Intent: The Apprentice" (1997). O'Toole said the line, "dying is easy; comedy is hard" and credited it to the last words of Kean in the 1982 movie "My Favorite Year".



Sanctuary city

A sanctuary city is a city that does not help its country's immigration police.

Sanctuary cities say they wish to cut down fear of deportation and possible family breakups with people who are in a country illegally. That's so that such people may be willing to report a crime and send their children to school.

Some states, such as Alabama, Iowa, Mississippi, Georgia, Missouri and Florida do not allow sanctuary cities. Others, such as Connecticut, Rhode Island, Illinois New York, Colorado and California allow sanctuary cities.

In early 2018, a Chicago federal judge said that the Trump administration could "not" withhold public safety grants to sancutary cities. Those decisions were seen as a setback to the Trump administration efforts for helping authorities police illegal immigrants.

Rafting

Rafting is an outdoor sport in which a person uses an inflatable raft to navigate a river or other body of water. This is often done on rough water. This usually requires teamwork. Rafting is a dangerous sport. People can die while rafting. Rafting is also a competitive sport. 

Rafting goes back to 1811 when the first attempt to go on the Snake River was planned. With no training, the river was too difficult and dangerous.

The International Scale of River Difficulty use six grades of difficulty to describe rivers for white water rafting. The scale ranges from simple to very dangerous and potential death or serious injuries.


Doom 64

Doom 64 is a video game that first came out only on the Nintendo 64, but can now be played on today's video game consoles. It is a direct sequel to Doom 2, making it the third part of the Doom story. This is ironic because the story of Doom 3 is not related to Doom or Doom 2, but it is a reboot, which means it is a new start to the Doom story.

Doom 64 has all the same weapons and monsters from Doom 2, but it has a few more new types of monsters and a new weapon, the Unmaker. The weapons and monsters look a little different from the earlier games, but there are fewer differences than in Doom 3. Other than the new graphics and new weapon, the gameplay was not much different from the earlier Doom games. It came out in 1997, but the game did not sell well because many popular FPS games came out that same year, including GoldenEye 007, Quake II, , and . However, the game does have a cult following and fans had made unlicensed mods on the PC and other video game consoles. Due to its popularity, Bethesda announced during Nintendo Direct 2019 that it would sell the game digitally on the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Steam on November 22, 2019. However, it was delayed until March 20, 2020, so that it could be sold the same day as Doom Eternal, the sequel to Doom (2016). It was the same game, but the lighting of the game was fixed, which was a major criticism of the N64 version of the game.

Mystic, Connecticut

Mystic is a U.S. village and census-designated place (CDP) in Groton and Stonington, Connecticut. Mystic has no independent government because it is not a municipality in the state of Connecticut.

Historically, Mystic was a leading seaport of the area. The story of Mystic's nautical background is told at Mystic Seaport, the nation's largest maritime museum, which has preserved a number of sailing ships, such as the whaling ship "Charles W. Morgan". The village is located on the Mystic River, which flows into Long Island Sound, giving access to the sea. The Mystic River Bascule Bridge crosses the river in the center of the village. According to the Mystic River Historical Society, the name "Mystic" comes from the Pequot words ""missi-tuk"" as describing a large river whose waters are driven into waves by tides or wind. The population was 4,348 at the 2020 census.

Reboot (fiction)

A reboot is a new start on a fictional universe that already exists. Some of the same themes may exist, but the story of the reboot is unrelated to earlier parts of the story. An example of this is the movie "Batman Begins". Even though it is set in the Batman universe, the story has no relation to any of the earlier Batman movies made by Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher. In video games, an example of this is "". Even though the game is still about a half-demon named Dante, like in the first game, the game's story has no relation to the earlier "Devil May Cry" games, and Dante in DmC has a very different look and personality from the earlier Dante.

A reboot is different from a remake because a remake is a retelling of a story that already exists. For example, the James Bond movie "Never Say Never Again" is a remake of "Thunderball". "Never Say Never Again" is a retelling same story as "Thunderball", but it is only a little different. In video games, an example of a remake is "", which has the same story as the first "Metroid" game, but it has more detailed graphics, new Power Suit abilities, and an entirely new area that is playable after the part of the game where the first game ended.

Bey

Bey also spelled as Baig, Bayg, Beigh, Beig, Bek, Baeg or Beg is a Turkic title for a chieftain, and an honorific title traditionally applied to people with special lineages to the leaders or rulers of variously sized areas in the numerous Turkic kingdoms, emirates, sultanates and empires in Central Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East, such as the Ottomans, Timurids or the various khanates and emirates in Central Asia and the Eurasian Steppe. The feminine equivalent title was begum. The regions or provinces where "beys" ruled or which they administered were called "beylik", roughly meaning "governorate" and/or "region" (the equivalent of county in other parts of Europe). However the exact scope of power handed to the beks (alternative spelling to beys) varied with each country, thus there was no clear-cut system, rigidly applied to all countries defining all the possible power and prestige that came along with the title.

In modern times, the word is still used formally as a social title for men. It is cited after the name and is used generally with first names and not with last names.

The word entered English from Turkish "bey", itself derived from Old Turkic "beg", which - in the form "bäg" - has been mentioned as early as in the Orkhon inscriptions (8th century AD) and is usually translated as "tribal leader". The actual origin of the word is still disputed, though it is mostly agreed that it was a loan-word, in Old Turkic. This Turkic word is usually considered a borrowing from an Iranian language. However, German Turkologist Gerhard Doerfer assessed the derivation from Iranian as superficially attractive but quite uncertain, and pointed out the possibility that the word may be genuinely Turkic.

Vincenzo Ferdinandi (Newark, 29 November 1920 - Rome, 22 April 1990) was an Italian fashion designer and one of the founders of Italian high fashion.

Born in the United States, he returned to Italy in the early fifties to open an atelier in Rome in the highly fashionable Via Veneto.
He was among the first great haute couture designers to compete with the most renowned French couturiers. In 1949 he was in Paris, called by Christian Dior for a stylistic collaboration. After that experience, Clark & Morland Ltd in London also called him to design a line of shoes.
Together with other names of the Italian fashion of the time such as Roberto Capucci, the Sartoria Antonelli, the atelier Carosa, Giovanelli Sciarra, Germana Marucelli, Polinober, the Sartoria Vanna and Jole Veneziani, he participated in 1952 in the first historical parade at the Sala Bianca in Palazzo Pitti in Florence. A very young Oriana Fallaci sent by the weekly Epoca told the news.
In 1953, together with other major names of the time (including Emilio Schuberth, the Sorelle Fontana, Alberto Fabiani, Giovannelli-Sciarra, Mingolini-Guggenheim, Eleonora Garnett and Simonetta), he founded the SIAM - Italian High Fashion Syndicate (later to become the National Chamber of Italian Fashion).

History of the University of Kansas

The history of the University of Kansas starts in 1855. This was when people wanted to build a "University of the Territory of Kansas." Nine years later in 1864, with the help of Amos Adams Lawrence, Kansas Governor Charles L. Robinson, and several other important people, the Kansas Legislature chartered the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas. The university was at first funded by a $15,000 donation on a area of land from Charles Robinson and his wife Sara. The university started preparatory-level classes in 1866 and college-level classes in 1869.

The idea for a public university in the Kansas Territory was first mentioned by Territorial Governor Andrew Reeder on July 3, 1855. He gave a speech to members of the first territorial legislature, saying: "To enlarge upon the necessity of general education for producing good government," he told the lawmakers, "would be at this day a work of supererogation, and I leave the matter in your hands, confident it will receive the attention it deserves." After his speech, the session responded by creating a system of common schools for the territory. They also approved a charter for a "University of the Territory of Kansas," proposed to be built in Douglas, Kansas (near present-day Lecompton). However, this proposed university was never built.

Lawrence residents had first thought of opening a private Free-State college in the town when it was first settled. This was in the summer of 1854. That fall, one of the members of the New England Emigrant Aid Company, Charles Robinson, told treasurer Amos Adams Lawrence that the people of Lawrence would start a college as soon as possible. It was supposed to be on top of Hogback Ridge (later known as Mount Oread). By 1856, no private college for Lawrence was yet created. However, the people of Lawrence were still hoping to create one. They also started to hope that it could later be changed into the state's university. On Christmas Day of 1856, a group of important Lawrence people approved a bill from a business committee. It said that the time had come to create a college in Lawrence. Fifteen trustees were chosen to govern the college. They immediately chose a committee to petition congress for land. It was estimated that $100,000 would be needed to get the college started properly. It was also believed that nearly all of this money would have to be raised outside of the Kansas Territory. The territorial legislature chartered a private "University of Lawrence" in January 1859. However, the people were never able to create a private college in Lawrence.

In 1859, in the Wyandotte Constitution - the constitution that Kansas became a state with - parts were written to create a state university. The first Kansas state legislature meeting in 1861, passed a bill that would create the state university in Manhattan, Kansas. They used the assets of the existing Blue Mont Central College. However, the bill was vetoed by Governor Charles Robinson of Lawrence. An attempt to override the veto in the Legislature failed by two votes. In 1862, another bill to make Manhattan the place of the state university failed by one vote. On February 16, 1863, the state accepted Manhattan's offer to donate the Blue Mont College building and grounds, and it created the state's land-grant college at the place. This would become Kansas State University.

However, the legislature said Manhattan's land-grant institution was different than what a "state university" is. On February 20, 1863, Kansas Governor Thomas Carney signed into law a bill creating the state university in Lawrence. The law said that if Lawrence wanted the college, Lawrence would need to give a $15,000 endowment fund and a place for the university. The place would have to be in or near the town, and it had to be at least forty acres (160,000 m²) big. If Lawrence did not do these, Emporia would get the university instead of Lawrence.

The place chosen for the university was a hill known as Mount Oread or Hogback Ridge. It was owned by former Kansas Governor Charles L. Robinson. Robinson and his wife Sara traded the area to the State of Kansas in exchange for land somewhere else. The philanthropist Amos Adams Lawrence gave $10,000 of the needed endowment fund. The people of Lawrence raised the remaining cash by issuing notes supported by Governor Carney. On November 2, 1863, Governor Carney said that Lawrence had met the conditions to get the state university. On March 1, 1864, the University of Kansas was officially chartered.

The school's Board of Regents had its first meeting in March 1865. This is the event that KU dates its creation from. Work on the first college building (Old North College) started later that year. On July 19, 1866, the Board of Regents elected KU's first three faculty members.

The University of Kansas officially opened on September 12, 1866. It had 26 girls and 29 boys registered in the preparatory school. The school started teaching college-level classes in 1869. The first class (of four students) graduated from the university in 1873. It was one of the first public colleges to admit women and men equally in the United States.

From these beginnings, a rivalry with Kansas State, the oldest public college in the state of Kansas, started.

A student of the early 1870s was writer and journalist Frank Harris. In Volume 1 of his memoirs ("My Life and Loves", 1922), he described the intellectual climate he found in the university at that time. He said its New England liberal roots were being overtaken by conservatism.

In April 1874, the school's first serious student publication, "Observer of Nature", was issued. In March 1878, former Chancellor James Marvin led the school's first "campus beautification" project. Over 300 trees were planted, including an area which is now known as the "Marvin Grove".

In May 1886, professor Edgar Henry Summerfield Bailey first proposed the cheer that would become the "Rock Chalk Jayhawk, K.U.” chant. Initially created for the KU science club, Bailey's version was "Rah, Rah, Jayhawk, KU" repeated three times. The rahs were later replaced by "Rock Chalk." This is a transposition of chalk rock, the name for the limestone found on Mount Oread, where the Lawrence campus is. Over time, the chant became known worldwide. Former U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt said it the "greatest college chant he'd ever heard." In 1920, the King of Belgium asked for a normal American college chant at the Olympic Games. After discussion, the athletes at the Games agreed on the Rock Chalk chant.

In 1893 the Kansas Legislature allowed $50,000 to build a new physics and electrical engineering building. The building resembled a French chateau now remembered as "old" Blake Hall. The next year, the university's library, Spooner Hall, was finished and opened. It is the oldest free-standing building still at KU. In 1895, the first long distance ship-to-shore message was sent by physics and engineering professor, Lucien I. Blake. The message was sent using underwater wireless technology.

In March 1898, lightning struck the engineering building and the heating plant. It started major fires, and destroyed both buildings. As a result, former Kansas City businessman George Fowler gave $18,000 to rebuild. It became known as the Fowler Shops. The building is now Stauffer-Flint Hall, where the journalism school is.

Starting in 1910, electric trolleys started providing service throughout Lawrence and the KU campus. In the same year, Marvin Hall was dedicated as the School of Engineering. Haworth Hall was dedicated for the departments of geology and mineralogy. One year later, a commencement ceremony was held. This marked the completion of Potter Lake. On February 8, 1912, a group of KU women organized the Women's Athletic Association. It was the first group of its kind in the school's history. William B. Thayer and his wife donated their personal art collection to KU, valued at $150,000.

In 1921, the Memorial Stadium was built to replace McCook Field. The football team still plays in Memorial Stadium. This makes it the seventh oldest college football stadium in the United States.

On May 13, 1923, William Allen White became the first KU alumnus to win a Pulitzer Prize. It was awarded to him for his Emporia Gazette editorial “To An Anxious Friend”. In that editorial, White defended free speech. The School of Business was created in 1924. The first campus union was built on in 1926 as a campus community center. On February 18, 1930, future KU alumnus Clyde Tombaugh said he discovered the planet Pluto. Later in 1930, present-day Snow Hall was completed and dedicated. It replaced the old, broken building. In 1932, one of KU's most famous football and wrestling stars, Pete Mehringer, qualified for the 1932 Olympics.

A major civil rights decision came on August 8, 1938. Under severe pressure from Kansas Governor Walter Huxman and several civil rights leaders, the Kansas Board of Regents voted to stop rules which had stopped black students from completing their education at the KU School of Medicine. The current chancellor's residence was finished in 1939. It was known as "The Outlook". The residence was able to be built because of Elizabeth Watkins. Danforth Chapel was officially dedicated in April 1946.

In January 1946, the University of Kansas Press was created. The publishing house later joined with other universities in Kansas. It became the statewide University Press of Kansas.

To honor the 276 KU men and women who died in World War II, the Memorial Carillon and Campanile were dedicated on May 27, 1951. In 1954, the debate team won their first National Debate Tournament. Allen Fieldhouse was dedicated on March 1, 1955. The KU basketball team would win its only home game of the season on the same night. In 1968, former senator Robert F. Kennedy had presidential nomination speeches at both KU and K-State.

In early 1970, a firebomb exploded throughout the Kansas Union. It caused almost $1 million in damage. The School of Nursing was created in 1974 as a joint and co-equal unit of the KU Medical Center. The debate team had more success throughout the 1970s. They won the National Debate Tournament in 1970 and 1976. On February 21, 1978 former U.S. President Gerald Ford dedicated the new KU School of Law, Green Hall.

In 1983, the debate team won the National Debate Tournament for the fourth time. KU dedicated its Vietnam Memorial in 1986. It was the first university in the United States to build a monument like that. On June 15, 1991, lightning hit Hoch Auditorium. This created a fire which destroyed the building in less than an hour.

In 1993, the KU Edwards Campus was created in Overland Park, Kansas. It was created in order to provide adults with a chance to get college degrees and to get better education. The Edwards campus started providing programs developmental psychology, public administration, social work, systems analysis, engineering management and design.

The football team, led by coach Mark Mangino, won the 2008 Orange Bowl. They finished the season 12–1.
In 2009, the debate team won the National Debate Tournament for the fifth time in KU's history. Also in 2009, Bernadette Gray-Little became the first woman and African American to be the chancellor at the university. Gray-Little retired on June 30, 2017.

Executive functions

Higher animals, including humans use their brain to control their behavior. The cognitive processes they use are known as executive functions (also called cognitive control): They are used to choose what to do and what to control, and whether the chosen goals have been achieved. Some executive functions are basic cognitive processes such as attentional control, cognitive inhibition, inhibitory control, working memory and cognitive flexibility. Higher-order executive functions require the use of several basic executive functions and include planning and fluid intelligence (for example reasoning and problem-solving).

Executive functions develop over time. They change during lifespan of an individual and can be improved at any time. Similarly, these cognitive processes can be adversely affected by different events.

Tests have been developed to assess the level of these functions. Rating scales can be used. These tests are usually performed as a part of a larger series of tests, which ain to find neurological and psychiatric disorders. An example of such a test is the Stroop test. An example of a scale is call Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive functions.

A counterexample of this is operant and classical conditioning: With these processes, individuals are "taught" to react in a certain way to a given stimulus. In such a situation, the individual must override the response to a stimulus using executive functions. This is called inhibitory control. The prefrontal cortex is necessary but not solely sufficient for executive functions; other parts of the brain also have a role in mediating inhibitory control.

Certain conditions affect cognitive control. These include addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, and other central nervous system disorders. Stimulus-driven behavioral responses that are associated with a particular rewarding stimulus tend to dominate one's behavior in an addiction.

The executive system is thought to be heavily involved in handling new situations outside the domain of some of our 'automatic' psychological processes that could be explained by the reproduction of learned schemas or set behaviors. Psychologists Don Norman and Tim Shallice have outlined five types of situations in which routine activation of behavior would not be sufficient for optimal performance:


A "prepotent response" is a response for which immediate reinforcement (positive or negative) is available or has been previously associated with that response. 

Executive functions are often invoked when it is necessary to override prepotent responses that might otherwise be automatically triggered by stimuli in the environment. For example, on being presented with a potentially rewarding stimulus, such as a tasty piece of chocolate cake, a person might have the automatic response to take a bite. However, where such behavior conflicts with internal plans (such as having decided not to eat chocolate cake while on a diet), the executive functions might be engaged to inhibit that response.

Although suppression of these prepotent responses is usually considered adaptive, problems for the development of the individual and the culture arise when feelings of right and wrong are overridden by cultural expectations or when creative impulses are overridden by executive inhibitions.

This practice has been in existence since the times of Guru Nanak Dev (1469 - 1539). During that time-period, this ceremony was known as Charan Amrit or Charan Phul or the Pag Pahul, the words "Charan" and "Pag" both signifying the foot of the teacher. During that time-period, the neophytes poured water over Guru's toe to be initiated into the fold. When the Guru was not present, the "masands" or the local "sangat" leaders officiated. The water was poured on Guru's toe and then the devotees would drink it and seek blessings of the Guru. The Guru would guide the Sikhs about the Sikh teachings and instruct them to adopt them as a way of life.

Khande di Pahul (Amrit ceremony) was initiated in the times of Guru Gobind Singh when Khalsa was inaugurated at Sri Anandpur Sahib on the day of Baisakhi in 1699. Guru Gobind Singh asked a gathering of Sikhs, "who is prepared to die for God?" At first, the people hesitated, and then one man stepped forward, and he was taken to a tent. After some time, Guru Gobind Singh came out of the tent, with blood dripping from his sword. He asked the same question again. After the next four volunteers were in the tent, he reappeared with the five, who were now all dressed like him. These five men came to be known as Panj Pyares or the Beloved Five. These five were initiated into the Khalsa by receiving Amrit. These five were Bhai Daya Singh, Bhai Mukham Singh, Bhai Sahib Singh, Bhai Dharam Singh and Bhai Himmat Singh. Sikh men were then given the name ""Singh"" meaning "lion" and the women received the last name ""Kaur"" meaning "princess"

"Khande Di Pahul" not only embodies the primary objects of Sikh faith and the promises connected therewith, but also is itself a promise to lead a pure and pious life to unite with Almighty Lord. It is about inward cleansing of the conscience and seeking unity with The Supreme Lord through His Grace. The word "Pahul" is a derivative from the substantive, "Pahu"- which is an agent which brightens, accelerates or sharpens the potentialities of a given object.

Amrit Chhakhna refers to the drinking of the Amrit or the Nectar. The Amrit is administered in the presence of the holy text of the Sikhs, the Guru Granth Sahib which is consideded the 11th Guru. The candidates take a full bath, wear the five 5 Kakas and present themselves before the Guru Granth Sahib for initiation of Amrit.

The five Sikhs, who represent the five beloved, who have led a virtuous life and have strictly observed the Sikh discipline are chosen to prepare and administer the Amrit. The candidates for baptism are apprised of the Amrit conditions for acceptance before the ceremony is started. They are apprised about the pure and virtuous life they must lead. When the candidates agree to live by the discipline and code of Sikh conduct, the "Panj Pyares" start preparing the Amrit.

A "Sarb Loh" (Iron or steel) cauldron (Bata or bowl) is filled with clean water. Some "Patashas" (sugar crystals/plums) are poured into the water. The Five Beloveds then sit in "Vir Asan" ( seated on the ground with left knee down and the right knee up) around the cauldron.

The mixture of Amrit is stirred with a "Khanda" while the Panj Pyares recite path of five Banis ("Japji Sahib", "Jaap Sahib", "Sawayae", "Chaupai Sahib" and "Anand Sahib") from Sri Guru Granth Sahib and Dasam Granth with attention and full concentration on the Amrit preparation in the cauldron. The solution thus prepared is called Amrit (nectar of immortality).

In this religion, it is believed that it should not be taken into mind that Amrit Chhakhna is the end purpose. It is the start of one's journey on a right path to attain a pure and pious life which is essential to attain God (according to the Guru Granth Sahib). It is not something external.

The person to become "Amritdhari" must wear the five holy symbols.

Monetary authority

In finance and economics, a monetary authority is the organization which controls the money supply of a currency. Their goal is to control inflation, interest rates, real GDP or the unemployment rate. With its monetary tools, a monetary authority is able to effectively influence the development of short-term interest rates for that currency. However, they can also influence other things which control the cost and availability of money.

A monetary authority is usually a central bank or currency board. Central banks usually have a some independence from the government and its political decisions. However, depending on the political set-up, governments can sometimes have almost total control over monetary policy if they are allowed to influence or control their central bank.

Money supply

The money supply (or money stock) is the total value of money available in an economy at a point of time. There are many ways to define "money". Normal measures usually include currency in circulation and demand deposits. Each country’s central bank may use its own definitions of what they consider to be money for its purposes.

Money supply data is recorded and published. It is done usually by the government or the central bank of the country. Public and private sector analysts look at changes in the money supply. This is because they believe that changes affect the price level of securities, inflation, the exchange rates and the business cycle.

Money is used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and as a ready store of value.

The different types of money are typically classified as "M"s. The "M"s usually range from M0 (narrowest) to M3 (broadest) but which "M"s are actually focused on in policy formulation depends on the country's central bank. The typical layout for each of the "M"s is as follows:

The ratio of a pair of these measures, most often M2 / M0, is called an (actual, empirical) money multiplier.


Monetary policy

Monetary policy is the policy used by the monetary authority of a country that controls either the interest rate that can be paid on very short-term borrowing or the money supply. They often target inflation or the interest rate to help make price stability and general trust in the currency.

Other goals of a monetary policy are usually to help make the gross domestic product more stable, to get and keep low unemployment, and to have predictable exchange rates with other currencies.

The term "Celtic punk" is usually used to describe bands who base their music in Irish or Scottish traditional music. It is considered part of the more general folk punk genre. However, folk punk is usually used for bands that use English, American and other forms of folk music as inspiration. 

The usual Celtic punk band includes a rock instrument as well as traditional instruments such as bagpipes, fiddle, tin whistle, accordion, mandolin, and banjo. Like Celtic rock, Celtic punk is a form of Celtic fusion.

In contrast, Jodi's older sister Harper is of average height and a multiple beauty pageant winner. Jack Dunkleman, a life-long friend, frequently asks her out, but she is reluctant, partly because he's much shorter than her.

Stig Mohlin, a Swedish foreign exchange student, joins Jodi's class, and she is immediately interested, along with most girls in her school. However, Kimmy Stitcher, her bully, starts showing him around. Dunkleman is distressed to learn that Stig will be staying at his house as the host family. Jodi asks Harper for help getting Stig to notice her. Harper and their mother help her with a complete makeover.

Kimmy and Schnipper prank call Jodi, pretending to be Stig and asking her to homecoming. To Fareeda's frustration, Jodi hides in the bathroom to avoid Kimmy. Stumbling across Stig playing the piano, he encourages her to play, and they sing the duet "I've Never Been in Love Before" from the musical "Guys and Dolls".

Jodi finds her father has organized a Tip Toppers (tall people club) chapter meeting in their house, which she finds upsetting. Stig calls, and at first, thinking it is another prank call, she yells at him, but he invites her to watch a musical. She turns up to Dunkleman's house, and he becomes jealous when he realizes she is there to see Stig. He continually interrupts their evening, but as Stig escorts Jodi home, they kiss. Later, feeling guilty, Stig asks Dunkleman for advice, and he tells him to focus on being with Kimmy. Jodi gets angry at Dunkleman when she learns this.

Meanwhile, another girl—Liz—asks Dunkleman on a date. Schnipper is now interested in Jodi, so he gets Kimmy to ask her to join them for an escape room; Jodi ditches a concert with Fareeda to go.

Margaret of Anjou

Margaret of Anjou (; 23 March 1430 – 25 August 1482) was the Queen consort of England by marriage to King Henry VI from 1445 to 1461 and again from 1470 to 1471. She was born in the Duchy of Lorraine into the House of Valois-Anjou. Margaret was the second eldest daughter of René, King of Naples and Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine.

Margaret was important in the Wars of the Roses. At times, she personally led the House of Lancaster into battle. Her husband had several nervous breakdowns. They were seen as insanity, so Margaret ruled the kingdom in his place. It was she who called for a Great Council in May 1455 that excluded the House of York headed by Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York. This started a civil conflict that lasted for more than thirty years. This conflict caused the deaths of thousands of men. One of those who died was her only son Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, at the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471.

Margaret was taken prisoner by the Yorkists after the Lancastrian defeat at Tewkesbury. In 1475, she was ransomed by her cousin, King Louis XI of France. She went to live in France as a poor relation of the French king. She died in France at the age of 52.

Margaret was born on 23 March 1430 at Pont-à-Mousson in Lorraine. Margaret was the second daughter of René, King of Naples and of Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine. She had five brothers and four sisters, as well as three half-siblings from her father's relationships with mistresses. Her father, popularly known as "Good King René", was duke of Anjou and titular king of Naples, Sicily and Jerusalem; he has been described as "a man of many crowns but no kingdoms". Margaret was baptised at Toul in Lorraine. She spent her early years at the castle at Tarascon on the River Rhône in Provence and in the old royal palace at Capua, near Naples in the Kingdom of Sicily. Her mother took care of her education and may have arranged for her to have lessons with the scholar Antoine de la Sale, who taught her brothers. In childhood Margaret was known as "la petite créature".

On 23 April 1445, Margaret married King Henry VI of England, at Titchfield Abbey in Hampshire. Henry was eight years older than she was. The king and queen of France were the uncle and aunt of the groom and the bride respectively: Henry's late mother, Catherine, had been the sister of King Charles VII, whose wife Marie of Anjou was a sister of Margaret's father René. Further, Henry claimed for himself the Kingdom of France. He also controlled parts of northern France. Due to all this, the French king agreed to the marriage of Margaret to his rival on the condition that he would not have to provide the customary dowry and instead would receive the lands of Maine and Anjou from the English. The English government, fearing a highly negative reaction, kept this provision secret from the English public.

Margaret was crowned Queen Consort of England on 30 May 1445 at Westminster Abbey by John Stafford, Archbishop of Canterbury at the age of fifteen. She was described as beautiful, and furthermore "already a woman: passionate and proud and strong-willed". Those that anticipated the future return of English claims to French territory believed that she already understood her duty to protect the interests of the Crown fervently. She seems to have inherited this from her mother, who fought to establish her husband's claim to the Kingdom of Naples, and from her paternal grandmother Yolande of Aragon, who actually governed Anjou "with a man's hand", putting the province in order and keeping out the English. Thus by family example and her own forceful personality, she was fully capable of becoming the "champion of the Crown".

Henry was more interested in religion and learning than in military matters and was not a successful king. He had reigned since he was only a few months old. Many of his actions had been done by people who ruled in his place. When he married Margaret, his mental condition was already unstable. At the time their only son, Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales was born (on 13 October 1453), Henry had already suffered a complete breakdown. There were rumours that he was incapable of fathering a child and that the new Prince of Wales was the result of an adulterous liaison. Many have speculated that either Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, or James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond was the young prince's actual father. Both were faithful allies of Margaret.

Although Margaret was aggressively partisan and had a volatile temperament, she shared her husband's love of learning because of her cultured upbringing. She also gave her patronage to the founding of Queens' College, Cambridge.

Elizabeth Woodville (born ca 1437), later Queen of England as future wife of Margaret's husband's rival, King Edward IV, may have served Margaret of Anjou as a maid of honour. However, there is to little evidence to permit historians to establish this with absolute certainty: several women at Margaret's court bore the name Elizabeth or Isabella Grey.

After retiring from London to live in lavish state at Greenwich, Margaret was occupied with the care of her young son and did not display any signs of political will until she believed her husband was threatened with deposition by the ambitious Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, who had been appointed Lord Protector while Henry was mentally incapacitated from 1453 to 1454. The duke was a credible claimant to the English throne and by the end of his protectorship there were many powerful nobles and relatives prepared to back his claim. The Duke of York was powerful; Henry's advisers corrupt; Henry himself trusting, pliable, and increasingly unstable; Margaret defiantly unpopular, grimly and gallantly determined to maintain the English crown for her children. Yet at least one scholar identifies the source of the eventual Lancastrian downfall not as York's ambitions nearly so much as Margaret's ill-judged enmity toward York and her over-indulgence in unpopular allies. Nevertheless, Queen Margaret was a powerful force in the world of politics. King Henry was putty in her hands when she wanted something done.

Margaret's biographer Helen Maurer, however, disagrees with earlier historians having dated the much-vaunted enmity between the Queen and York to the time he obtained the office of the protectorship. She suggests the mutual antagonism came about two years later in 1455 in the wake of the First Battle of St Albans, when Margaret perceived him as a challenge to the king's authority. Maurer bases this conclusion on a study of Margaret's pattern of presenting gifts; this revealed that Margaret took a great deal of care to demonstrate that she favoured both York and Edmund Beaufort (Somerset) equally in the early 1450s. Maurer also claims that Margaret appeared to accept York's protectorship and asserts there is no substantial evidence to back up the long-standing belief that she was responsible for the Yorkists' exclusion from the Great Council following Henry's recovery (see below).

The late historian Paul Murray Kendall, on the other hand, maintained that Margaret's allies Edmund Beaufort (Somerset) and William de la Pole, then Earl of Suffolk, had no difficulty in persuading her that York, until then one of Henry VI's most trusted advisers, was responsible for her unpopularity and already too powerful to be trusted. Margaret not only convinced Henry to recall York from his post as governor in France and banish him instead to Ireland, she attempted to have him assassinated during his travels to and from Ireland, once in 1449 and again in 1450. Edmund Beaufort (Somerset) and Suffolk's joint responsibility for the secret surrender of Maine in 1448, and then the subsequent disastrous loss of the rest of Normandy in 1449 embroiled Margaret and Henry's court in riots, uprisings by the magnates, and calls for the impeachment and execution of Margaret's two strongest allies. It also might have made an ultimate battle to the death between Margaret and the House of York inevitable by making manifest Richard's dangerous popularity with the Commons. Richard of York, safely returned from Ireland in 1450, confronted Henry and was readmitted as a trusted advisor. Soon thereafter, Henry agreed to convene Parliament to address the calls for reform. When Parliament met, the demands could not have been less acceptable to Margaret: not only were both Edmund Beaufort (Somerset) and Suffolk impeached for criminal mismanagement of French affairs and subverting justice, but it was charged as a crime against Suffolk (now a duke) that he had antagonised the king against the Duke of York. Further, the demands for reform put forward included that the Duke of York be acknowledged as the first councillor to the king, and the Speaker of Commons, perhaps with more fervour than wisdom, even proposed Richard, Duke of York, be recognised as heir to the throne. Within a few months, however, Margaret had regained control of Henry, Parliament was dissolved, the incautious Speaker thrown in prison, and Richard of York retired to Wales for the time being.

In 1457, the kingdom was again outraged when it was discovered that Pierre de Brézé, a powerful French general and an adherent of Margaret, had landed on the English coast and burnt the town of Sandwich. As leader of a French force of 4,000 men from Honfleur, he aimed at taking advantage of the chaos in England. The mayor, John Drury, was killed in this raid. It thereafter became an established tradition, which survives to this day, that the Mayor of Sandwich wears a black robe mourning this ignoble deed. Margaret, in association with de Brézé, became the object of scurrilous rumours and vulgar ballads. Public indignation was so high that Margaret, with great reluctance, was forced to give the Duke of York's kinsman Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, a commission to keep the sea for three years. He already held the post of Captain of Calais.

Hostilities between the rival Yorkist and Lancastrian factions soon flared into armed conflict. In May 1455, just over five months after Henry VI recovered from a bout of mental illness and Richard of York's protectorship had ended, Margaret called for a Great Council from which the Yorkists were excluded. The Council called for an assemblage of the peers at Leicester to protect the king "against his enemies". York apparently was prepared for conflict and soon was marching south to meet the Lancastrian army marching north. The Lancastrians suffered a crushing defeat at the First Battle of St Albans on 22 May 1455. Edmund Beaufort (Somerset), the Earl of Northumberland and Lord Clifford were killed, Wiltshire fled the battlefield and King Henry was taken prisoner by the victorious Duke of York. In March 1458 along with her husband and leading nobles of the warring factions, she took part in The Love Day procession in London.

In 1459, hostilities resumed at the Battle of Blore Heath, where James Tuchet, 5th Baron Audley, was defeated by a Yorkist army under Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury

While Margaret was attempting to raise further support for the Lancastrian cause in Scotland, her principal commander, Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset, gained a major victory for her at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460 by defeating the combined armies of the Duke of York and the Earl of Salisbury. Both men were beheaded and their heads displayed on the gates of the city of York. As Margaret was in Scotland at the time the battle had taken place, it was impossible that she issued the orders for their executions despite popular belief to the contrary. She followed up with a victory at the Second Battle of St Albans (at which she was present) on 17 February 1461. In this battle, she defeated the Yorkist forces of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, and recaptured her husband. It was after this battle that she, in a blatant act of vengeance, ordered the execution of two Yorkist prisoners of war, William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville, and Sir Thomas Kyriell, who had kept watch over King Henry to keep him out of harm's way during the battle. The king had promised the two knights immunity, but Margaret gainsaid him and ordered their executions by decapitation. It is alleged that she put the men on trial at which her son presided. "Fair son", she allegedly asked, "what death shall these knights die?" Prince Edward replied that their heads should be cut off, despite the king's pleas for mercy.

The Lancastrian army was beaten at the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461 by the son of the late Duke of York, the future Edward IV of England, who deposed King Henry and proclaimed himself king. Margaret was determined to win back her son's inheritance and fled with him into Wales and later Scotland. Finding her way to France, she made an ally of her cousin, King Louis XI of France, and at his instigation she allowed an approach from Edward's former supporter, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, who had fallen out with his former friend as a result of Edward's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, and was now seeking revenge for the loss of his political influence. Warwick's daughter, Anne Neville, was married to Margaret's son Edward, Prince of Wales, in order to cement the alliance, and Margaret insisted that Warwick return to England to prove himself before she followed. He did so, restoring Henry VI briefly to the throne on 3 October 1470.

By the time Margaret, her son and daughter-in-law (Anne) were ready to follow Warwick back to England, the tables had again turned in favour of the Yorkists, and the Earl was defeated and killed by the returning King Edward IV in the Battle of Barnet on 14 April 1471. Margaret was forced to lead her own army at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May 1471, at which the Lancastrian forces were defeated and her seventeen-year-old son Edward of Westminster was killed. The circumstances of Edward's death have never been made clear; it is not known whether he was killed in the actual fighting or executed after the battle by the Duke of Clarence. If he died in battle, he would have been the only Prince of Wales ever to do so. Over the previous ten years, Margaret had gained a reputation for aggression and ruthlessness, but following her defeat at Tewkesbury and the death of her only son, she was completely broken in spirit. After she was taken captive by William Stanley at the end of the battle, Margaret was imprisoned by the order of King Edward. She was sent first to Wallingford Castle and then was transferred to the more secure Tower of London. Henry VI was also imprisoned in the Tower in the wake of Tewkesbury and he died there on the night of 21 May; the cause of his death is unknown, though regicide was suspected. In 1472 she was placed in the custody of her former lady-in-waiting Alice Chaucer, Duchess of Suffolk, where she remained until ransomed by Louis XI in 1475.

Margaret lived in France for the next seven years as a poor relation of the king. She was hosted by Francis de Vignolles and died in his castle of Dampierre-sur-Loire, near Saumur (Anjou) on 25 August 1482 at the age of 52. She was entombed next to her parents in Angers Cathedral, but her remains were removed and scattered by revolutionaries who ransacked the cathedral during the French Revolution.

Many letters, written by Margaret during her tenure as queen consort, still exist. One was written to the Corporation of London regarding injuries inflicted on her tenants at the manor of Enfield, which comprised part of her dower lands. Another letter was written to the Archbishop of Canterbury. Margaret's letters, which were typically headed with the words "By the Quene," are compiled in a book edited by Cecil Monro, which was published for the Camden Society in 1863.

Cooperative gameplay

Cooperative gameplay (often abbreviated as co-op) is something in video games that allows players to work together as teammates. This would be different from other multiplayer modes, such as competitive multiplayer modes like player versus player or deathmatch. Playing at the same time allows players to help each another in many ways: giving weapons or items, healing, giving covering fire in a firefight, and doing cooperative things such as helping a teammate go past obstacles.

Co-op gameplay has been becoming more popular in video games in recent years. This is partly because controller and networking technology has become better.

It still sells, with over 1.5 million digital copies sold in the United States. It is considered to be Denver's signature song.

The song has a status as an iconic symbol of West Virginia, which it describes as "almost Heaven". In March 2014, it became one of the four official state anthems of West Virginia.

"Take Me Home, Country Roads" received a positive response from West Virginia people. The song is the theme song of West Virginia University. It has been performed during every home football pregame show since 1972.

This song was played at the funeral memorial for West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd at the state capitol in Charleston on July 2, 2010.

The popularity of the song has gotten bills in the West Virginia Legislature to make "Take Me Home, Country Roads" an official state song. On March 7, 2014, the West Virginia Legislature approved a bill to make "Take Me Home, Country Roads" an official state song of West Virginia. They did this along three other songs: "West Virginia Hills", "This is My West Virginia", and "West Virginia, My Home Sweet Home".

Neper (mythology)

Neper was the god of grains, specifically grains that were significant in Ancient Egyptian times, such as wheat, corn, and barley. His name means lord of the mouth. Neper also represented sustenance and nourishment. It was said that he predicted the times of the year when the crops grew, were harvested, and disappeared. He was worshipped mainly because he was a god that kept people healthy through their food.
Neper was a god in human form. However, he had distinctive marks to represent grains. He had dots on his clothing to represent corn grains. He also had grains above his head, like in the picture to the left. He was also often shown carrying wheat, or similar crops. He wore little clothes, like in the picture where it shows him wearing a cloth around his waist. Neper was worshipped all over Egypt. 

Neper had a female version of himself, called Nepit. Nepit was the goddess of grain. Neper's mother, Renenutet, was a goddess of nourishment, and harvesting, who also represented grains. Neper was also seen as a form of Osiris, the god of death and the underworld. People saw him as a form of Osiris because he appeared and disappeared at the times of annual harvest, just like Osiris came back from the dead. He, along with Osiris, was often thought of the god that was "Living after he had died".

Blackface

Blackface is a kind of costume or make up which involves putting black make-up on to imitate a racist image of a Black or African American person. Blackface became popular in the 19th century especially during Reconstruction after the American Civil War.

By the mid 19th century, blackface minstrel shows became a distinctive artform. It translated formal works, like opera, into popular terms for general audiences.

.gov

The domain name gov is the generic top-level domain used by government websites used in the United States at the federal, state, and local levels. It was one of the first top-level domains, made in January 1985.

The U.S. is the only country that has a government-specific top-level domain in addition to its ccTLD. Other countries typically use a second-level domain for this purpose, e.g., .gov.au for Australia, .gov.uk for the United Kingdom, .gc.ca for Canada, and .gouv.fr for France. Since the United States controls the .gov Top Level Domain, it would be impossible for another country to create a domain ending in .gov, for example, .jp.gov.

Some U.S. federal agencies use .fed.us rather than .gov. The Department of Defense and its subsidiary organizations use .mil. Some U.S. governmental entities use other domains, such as the use of .com domains by the United States Postal Service (usps.com) and the United States Army (goarmy.com). Internet purists consider these usages to be improper, as these are governmental or military entities rather than commercial ones.

All governments in the U.S. are allowed to use .gov, such as atlantaga.gov for the city of Atlanta, and georgia.gov for the U.S. state of Georgia. This was not always true; under an earlier policy, only federal agencies were allowed to use the domain, and agencies beneath cabinet level were needed to use subdomains of their parent agency.

The usage of .gov as a gTLD controlled only by the U.S. is controversial, as some people believe this to be an example of arrogance by the U.S. – such views hold that usage of .fed.us or a new second-level domain of .gov.us would be more suitable. Others believe that U.S. control of .gov is a natural result of the fact that the U.S. federal government was responsible for the initial creation of the Internet and its first user.

Despite this, merger talks continued in the hopes that they might be able to pull off a last-minute deal. However, on August 2, Child World announced that the plan failed and continued the process of shutting down the last 71 stores in the next 6 weeks.

The Addams Family (1991 movie)

The Addams Family (1991) is an American movie based on the cartoon by Charles Addams and the TV series by David Levy. It was the first movie directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. A sequel was released in 1993.

Gomez Addams (Raul Julia) misses his brother Fester (Christopher Lloyd), who left 25 years earlier after they had a big fight. Gomez's lawyer, Tully Alford (Dan Hedaya), owes money to Abigail Craven (Elizabeth Wilson), and notices that her adopted son, Gordon looks like Fester. Tully tells Gordon to pretend to be Fester to get close to the Addams family and find their riches. Tully and his wife, Margaret (Dana Ivey), join Grandmama to try to talk to Fester's ghost. Gordon arrives, pretending to be Fester, and Abigail tells the family Fester has been in the Bermuda Triangle.

Gomez takes him to the family vault to watch home movies from their childhood. Gordon learns that Gomez was jealous of Fester, and he dated the Amor twins to get even with Fester. Gomez starts to think that this is not the real Fester. Gordon tries to return to the vault, but can't get past a booby trap. Gomez's wife, Morticia (Anjelica Huston), threatens the fake Fester, saying how much the Addamses love family, and don't trust outsiders.

Gordon grows closer to the Addams family, particularly the children Wednesday (Christina Ricci) and Pugsley (Jimmy Workman), and he teaches them about swords for a school play. Fake Fester goes to the play, even though Abigail told him not to do so. After the play, Abigail says fake Fester must go away again, so the Addamses throw a large party. Wednesday hears Abigail and Gordon talking about plans to break into the vault. Tully learns that Fester, as the biggest brother, owns all of the Addams property. The Addamses' neighbor, Judge George Womack (Paul Benedict), helps the bad guys kick the Addamses out of their house.

Abigail, Gordon and Tully try and fail many times to get past the booby trap blocking the vault. The Addams family must move to a motel and get jobs. Morticia tries being a preschool teacher, Wednesday and Pugsley sell poisoned lemonade, and Thing (Christopher Hart)—the family's living hand—becomes a "delivery hand." Gomez is too sad to work.

Morticia returns to the Addams home and Abigail and Tully catcher her and punish her, trying to learn how to get in the vault. Thing sees them and tells Gomez. The Addamses rush to save Morticia. Abigail threatens to kill Morticia unless they give her their money. Gordon stops Abigail. He uses a magic book to make a storm hit the house. Lightening strikes his head and launches Tully and Abigail out a window and into graves Wednesday and Pugsley had dug.

Gordon's memory returns after the lightening strike, and he remembers that he was the real Fester all along. Morticia tells Gomez that she is pregnant.

The soundtrack for "The Addams Family" features the song "Addams Groove" by MC Hammer.

Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump

An impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump began on September 24, 2019, when Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, announced in a televised speech the beginning of a formal impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States. 

It began after President Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani repeatedly wanted the Ukrainian government to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden, in what was seen as an attempt to hurt Biden's candidacy for president and for Trump to gain advantages in the 2020 election.

In July prior to the phone call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump stopped military aid to Ukraine; he released the hold in September.

Further revelations have been revealed, including; President Trump claiming to Russian officials in 2017 that he was unconcerned with Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo participating in the phone call to the Ukrainian President despite not being present in the released memo from the Trump Administration, as well as President Trump also pressuring Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison in a phone call to investigate the origins of the Mueller Report in an attempt to discredit it. 

On October 28, 2019, Speaker Pelosi announced she would hold a floor vote on a resolution to formally establish the procedures for the impeachment hearings. On October 31, 2019, the House voted 232–196 to create procedures for public hearings.

The inquiry ended on December 3. On December 5, Nancy Pelosi asked the Judiciary Committee to draft articles of impeachment against President Trump. On December 16, the House Judiciary Committee released a report specifying criminal bribery and wire fraud charges as part of the abuse of power charge. The house voted to impeach Trump on December 18, 2019. On February 5, 2020 the Senate acquitted Trump on both count. The votes were 52-48 to acquit on the first count and 53-47 to acquit on the second count.

First impeachment of Donald Trump

The first impeachment of Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, began on September 24, 2019, after a whistleblower alleged that Trump had pressured foreign leaders. The scandal was about Trump telling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden and his father Joe Biden, a former vice-president and a candidate for the 2020 presidential election. It ended on February 5, 2020.

The inquiry stage of Trump's impeachment lasted from September to November 2019. In October 2019, three Congressional committees (Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs) deposed witnesses.

In November 2019, the House Intelligence Committee held a number of public hearings in which witnesses testified publicly. On December 3, the House Intelligence Committee voted 13–9 along party lines to adopt a final report.

A set of impeachment hearings before the Judiciary Committee began on December 4, 2019. On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee voted 23–17 along party lines to recommend two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Judiciary Committee also released a report on the articles of impeachment on December 16.

The first hearing, held on December 4, 2019, was an academic discussion on the definition of an impeachable offense. The witnesses invited by Democrats were law professors Noah Feldman from Harvard, Pamela S. Karlan from Stanford, and Michael Gerhardt from the University of North Carolina. Republicans invited Jonathan Turley, a constitutional scholar at George Washington University.

On December 18, the full House approved the articles of impeachment, making Trump the third president in U.S. history to be impeached.

On January 10, 2020, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she had "asked Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to be prepared to bring to the Floor next week a resolution to appoint managers and transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate".

At the end of the January 21 session, the Senate voted along party lines to pass Mitch McConnell's proposed trial rules and reject 11 amendments proposed by Democrats. The prosecution's opening arguments and presentation of evidence took place between January 22–24. Trump's defense presentation began on January 25. The primary arguments were a lack of direct evidence of wrongdoing, and that Democrats were attempting to use the impeachment to steal the 2020 election. Under the U.S. Constitution, a two-thirds majority of the Senate is required to convict the president.

On February 5, 2020 the Senate acquitted Trump on both count. The votes were 52-48 to acquit on the first count and 53-47 to acquit on the second count.

The Treaty of Fort Wise of 1861 was a treaty signed between the United States and six chiefs of the Southern Cheyenne and four of the Southern Arapaho Indian tribes.

However, in November 1858, people found gold in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado (then part of the western Kansas Territory). This created a gold rush.

Greenwood, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, came to Bent's New Fort along the Arkansas River to make a new treaty.

On February 18, 1861, six chiefs of the Southern Cheyenne and four of the Arapaho signed the Treaty of Fort Wise with the United States. This was at Bent's New Fort at Big Timbers. This was near what is now Lamar, Colorado. Lamar had been recently leased by the U.S. Government, and the name changed to Fort Wise. The Native Americans gave most of the lands given to them by the Fort Laramie treaty to the United States.

Wichita State University football team plane crash

On Friday, October 2, 1970 at 1:14 p.m. MDT in Colorado a chartered Martin 4-0-4 airliner crashed into a mountain eight miles (13 km) west of Silver Plume. It happened in clear weather. The twin-engined propliner carried 37 passengers and a crew of three; 29 were killed at the scene and two later died of their injuries while under medical care. It was operated by Golden Eagle Aviation.

It was one of two aircraft carrying the Wichita State University football team to Logan, Utah. They were going to Utah for a game against Utah State University. The other plane flew a normal route and arrived safely in Utah. Pilot errors, including bad in-flight choices and bad pre-flight planning, were officially reported as what caused the crash.

Windshield

The windshield (American English) or windscreen (Commonwealth English) is the front window of a vehicle. It lets drivers see out while at the same time protecting passengers and the driver from weather. Aircraft, cars, buses, motorbikes or trams can all have windshields. 

Windshields on cars and aircraft are designed to protect the vehicle against wind and flying debris (such as dust, rocks, and insects). Windshields on motorbikes are designed to shield the driver from wind, though it doesn't protect as much as other vehicle windshields do.

Modern windshields are generally made of laminated safety glass, a type of treated glass. The laminated safety glass used for vehicles is made of two curved sheets of glass with a plastic layer between them. This laminated safety glass is then joined into the window frame. 

Motorbike windshields are different to the ones found on cars or aircraft. Motorbike windshields are often made of high-impact polycarbonate or acrylic plastic.

Before laminated safety glass, vehicles used ordinary window glass as a windshield. However, ordinary window glass can shatter if the vehicle had a massive physical impact, which would produce flying sharp pieces of glass that can injure people. On 1917, Henry Ford developed the laminated safety glass from the French, which would help prevent broken glass from shattering. Modern windshields were developed from Ford's developments.

Archaic period (North America)

In the classification of the , the Archaic period or "Meso-Indian period" in North America, starts from about 8000 BC, and it ends at about 1000 BC. In the sequence of North American pre-Columbian cultural stages, is a period defined by the "archaic stage" of cultural development. 
The Archaic stage is characterized by subsistence economies. These economies were supported through the use of nuts, seeds, and shellfish. Because it ended when people started using sedentary farming, this date can be different by a lot across the Americas.

The rest of the Americas also have an Archaic Period.

This classification system was first proposed by Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips in the widely accepted 1958 book "Method and Theory in American Archaeology".
In the organization of the system, the Archaic period is after the Lithic stage. The Archaic period is before the Formative stage.


Thatching

Thatching is building a roof with dry vegetation such as straw, reeds, sedge ("Cladium mariscus"), rushes, heather, or palm branches. The vegetation is put on top of each other so as to make sure water stays away from the inner roof.

Thatch can occasionally catch fire. This is one reason for its replacement by slates in modern buildings. Ceramic slates for roofing can be made by industry, and have replaced natural slates in modern housing. Thatched rooves were once a source of fires, but slates are fireproof. That explains the gradual decline in thatched rooves.

37th parallel north

The 37th parallel north is a circle of latitude that is 37 degrees north of the Earth's equatorial plane. It crosses Europe, the Mediterranean Sea, Africa, Asia, the Pacific Ocean, North America, and the Atlantic Ocean.

At this latitude, the sun can be seen for 14 hours, 42 minutes during the summer solstice and 9 hours, 37 minutes during the winter solstice. This is about the northern limit of the visibility of Canopus, the second-brightest star of the night sky.

Starting at the Prime Meridian and heading eastwards, the parallel 37° north passes through:

In the United States, the parallel is the southern borders of Utah, Colorado, and Kansas, and the northern borders of Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. The border comes from the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 when Congress divided Indian Territory into Kansas and Nebraska north of the 37th parallel. They gave the rest to the Indian Territory to the south.

KHD was a German company that owned the Deutz-Fahr brand of agriculture equipment. KHD had bought parts of the Allis-Chalmers agricultural equipment business five years earlier.

In March 1991, AGCO bought the Hesston Corporation.<ref name="AGCO-Jul-1996-S-4/A"></ref> Because of this, they gained hay and forage equipment as well as technologies such as the grain auger (used to unload grain quickly from combines), invented in 1947 by Lyle Yost. Hesston had a 50 percent joint venture with Case International, now a part of CNH Global. AGCO bought the White Tractor line from the Allied Corporation's White-New Idea company. In 1993, AGCO bought the rest of White-New Idea, gaining New Idea hay equipment and manure spreaders, and White planters. White New Idea had a big manufacturing plant in Coldwater, Ohio, USA.

In 2013, AGCO’s GSI acquired Johnson System, a manufacturer of catwalks and towers. 

In 2017, AGCO acquired Precision Planting, LLC, a planting equipment and technology business.

1951 Central Missouri State vs. Southwestern football game

The 1951 Central Missouri State vs. Southwestern football game was a college football game between the Central Missouri State Mules and the Southwestern Moundbuilders. It was played on September 14, 1951. The game was played at Sonner Stadium in Winfield, Kansas. The game is known for a team rejecting a touchdown awarded by the game officials.

Central Missouri's head coach Tate C. Page called it "the finest act of sportsmanship" that he ever saw. In the third quarter, Southwestern halfback Arthur Johnson completed a long run down the sidelines nearest Southwestern's bench. The referee signaled a touchdown. The crowd of 2,000 cheered.

Southwestern's head coach Harold Hunt ran out on the field to shout, "Southwestern rejects the touchdown!" He then told the officials that Johnson had stepped out of bounds. This would undo the touchdown. None of the referees had seen this happen, but they agreed to undo the touchdown. They put the ball back to the place where Coach Hunt said Johnson had stepped out. A photo of the run later showed Coach Hunt was correct. It was published in the Winfield Daily Courier.

Referee W. P. Astle noted that there had been only three officials at the game instead of the regulation four. He later said, "If the fourth official had been present to cover what was impossible for me to cover ... I would never have discovered the ‘biggest’ man I ever met."

Southwestern's Coach Hunt was nominated for "Football's Man of the Year" by This Week magazine. This was because he showed so much sportsmanship.

Southwestern Moundbuilders

The Southwestern Moundbuilders are the athletic teams that represent Southwestern College in Winfield, Kansas. They are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). They compete in the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference (KCAC).

The school boasts the following accomplishments:

1905 Washburn vs. Fairmount football game

The 1905 Washburn vs. Fairmount football game was a college football game between Fairmount College (now called Wichita State University) and the Washburn Ichabods. It was played on December 25, 1905, in Wichita, Kansas. It was the first experiment with the forward pass. It was also the first experiment with the ten-yard requirement for first downs. It is unclear if the game was considered "regular season", "post season", or "exhibition" in classification.

Fairmount college was coached by Willis Bates. The head coach for Washburn that season was John H. Outland. However, since he was officiating, it is likely that the coaching job was given to assistant coach (and next year's head coach) Garfield Weede. The game ended in a 0–0 tie.

The weather for the game were good, but neither side was able to get close to the other team's goal except by a punt. Only seven first downs were made the entire game—four by Washburn and three by Fairmount. Most of the game was played in the middle of the field. The fans were upset.

Both teams had played a previous game that same season. What made this second game different was that it was a test of a different way to play. During the game, each team's offense was required to gain ten yards in three downs instead of four to earn a new first down.

The experiment was considered a failure. Football legend John H. Outland officiated the game and said, "It seems to me that the distance required in three downs would almost eliminate touchdowns, except through fakes or flukes." The "Los Angeles Times" said that there was much kicking and that the game was considered much safer than regular play, but that the new rule was not "conducive to the sport."

Three days later, 62 schools met in New York City to discuss rule changes to make the game safer. As a result of that meeting, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later named the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), was created. Several other rule changes were made to make the game safer for players, including the addition of the forward pass.

In his history of the sport of football, David M. Nelson said that "the first forward passes were thrown at the end of the 1905 season in a game between Fairmount and Washburn colleges in Kansas." Nelson says that Washburn did three passes, and Fairmount did two. Credit for the first pass goes to Fairmount's Bill Davis, who did a pass to Art Solter.

Harold Hunt (coach)

Harold Seymore Hunt (December 12, 1907 – November 1, 1992) was an American football and basketball coach. He got nationwide exposure as an example of sportsmanship when he rejected a touchdown that would have won a game for his team.

Hunt was the 13th head football coach for the Southwestern College in Winfield, Kansas. He was coach for three seasons, from 1949 to 1951, and compiled a record of 6–18–3

During the 1905 season, the Coleman Company set up temporary gas-powered lighting for a night game against Fairmount College (now called Wichita State University). It was the first night football game played west of the Mississippi River. Fairmount won the game 24–0.

AGA cooker

The AGA cooker is a heat storage stove and cooker. The heavy frame is made of cast iron and absorbs heat from a low-intensity source. Originally, AGAs burnt coke or anthracite. Later versions used gas as the heat source.

The heat is used for cooking. It was invented and initially produced in Sweden. From 1957 all production has been in the United Kingdom.

The cast-iron parts were cast at the Coalbrookdale foundry in the 1940s. They were still made there by the Aga Rangemaster Group until November 2017 when the company closed the site.

Owners often talk about how the AGA actually makes their homes more energy efficient. The AGA does a number of jobs: it replaces several radiators, a tumble dryer, electric kettle and toaster. It is not just a cooker.

The company which makes AGAs also makes other stoves, such as the Rayburn range. It is the Aga Rangemaster Group, which was taken over by the US company Middleton Corporation in 2015.

Topeka Constitution

The Topeka Constitutional Convention met from October 23 to Nov 11, 1855 in Topeka, Kansas Territory at Constitution Hall. It wrote the Topeka Constitution that would have made slavery in Kansas illegal. The convention was organized by Free-Staters to go against the pro-slavery Territorial legislature elected March 5, 1855. The territorial legislature was elected in polling that had a lot of electoral fraud and the intimidation of free state settlers.

The Topeka Constitution was the first effort to create a Kansas governmental structure and write its basis in law. Free-State people passed the constitution on December 15, 1855. The constitution was sent to Washington. They really wanted the U.S. Congress to pass it. President Pierce hated the document. It was presented in the Senate by Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan and in the House by Representative Daniel of Indiana. It passed the House by two votes on July 2. However, it was held in committee by the Senate. On July 8, Senator Stephen A. Douglas took up the Topeka Constitution in a bill counter to Senator Cass. Cass sent the issue back to the people of Kansas to follow the Kansas-Nebraska Act.



Leavenworth Constitution

The Leavenworth Constitution was one of four Kansas state constitutions written during the era of Bleeding Kansas. The Leavenworth Constitution was written by a convention of Free-Staters. It was the most progressive of the four proposed constitutions. Important parts of this Constitution were a Bill of Rights that referred to ""all men"" (making no distinction between the rights of white men and black men), making slavery in the state illegal, and a basic framework for the rights of women.

The constitutional convention that wrote the Leavenworth Constitution was provided for by an act of the Territorial Legislature passed in February 1858, while the Lecompton Constitution was being debated in Congress. The constitution was adopted by the convention at Leavenworth April 3, 1858. It was also chosen by the people at an election on May 18, 1858.

The Leavenworth Constitution did not have a big impact on the history of Kansas since the US Senate did not approve of the laws in the document. The other proposed state constitutions were the Topeka Constitution (1855), the Lecompton Constitution (1857) and the Wyandotte Constitution (1859).

Fowler first played for an all-white professional team based out of New Castle, Pennsylvania in 1872. He was 14 years old. He is documented as playing for another professional team on July 21, 1877. He was 19. On April 24, 1878, he pitched a game for the Picked Nine, who defeated the Boston Red Caps, champions of the National League in 1877. He pitched some more for the Chelsea team, then finished that season with the Worcester club.

Baseball color line

The color line, also known as the color barrier, in American baseball stopped players of black African descent from playing Major League Baseball and its affiliated Minor Leagues until 1947 (with a few notable exceptions in the 19th century before the line was firmly established). Racial segregation in professional baseball was sometimes called a gentlemen's agreement. This means an understanding, as there was no written policy at the highest level of organized baseball, the major leagues. There was minor league's vote in 1887 against allowing new contracts with black players within its league. It sent a powerful message that eventually led to blacks not being allowed to play at all.

African Americans created the Negro leagues starting in 1887. In these leagues, African American baseball teams played against each other. 

The color line was broken for good when Jackie Robinson signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers organization for the 1946 season.

The beginning of segregation followed the baseball season of 1867. On October 16, the Pennsylvania State Convention of Baseball in Harrisburg denied admission to the "colored" Pythian Baseball Club.

In 1888, Leavenworth returned to the loop and went 7-7 under L. M. Cretors. They were in second place when the league stopped operations on June 21. A J. Curran was leading the club in batting average at .300.

Barn raising

A barn raising, also historically called a raising bee or rearing in the U.K., is a collective action of a community, in which a barn for one of the members is built or rebuilt by members of the community. Barn raising was common in 18th- and 19th-century rural North America. A barn was a necessary building for any farmer. Yet a barn was also a big and expensive building. Building a farm needed many people than a typical family could provide. Barn raising addressed the need by getting members of the community, unpaid, to help in the building of their neighbors' barns. Because each member was entitled to recruit others for help, the favor would eventually return to each participant.

One or more people with experience or with specific skills are chosen to lead the project. Young people helping for the first time have watched many barn raisings and know what is expected of them.

Coronado, Kansas

Coronado was an unincorporated community in Wichita County, Kansas, United States. It was platted in 1885. Coronado was involved in the bloodiest county seat fight in the history of the American West.

Coronado had a post office from 1886 until 1899.


County seat war

A county seat war is an American phenomenon that happened mostly in the Old West as it was being settled. Although, there were similar events elsewhere, such as in southeastern Ohio. As new towns were created and county lines were drawn, there was intense competition for the status and tax benefits received by becoming a county seat. These "wars" often involved nothing more than lining up at the ballot box. However, sometimes people from a particular town would use voter fraud, intimidation or violence. 


Transcontinental railroad

A transcontinental railroad is a network of railroad trackage that crosses a continental land mass. It must be continuous. It has terminals at different oceans or continental borders. Such networks can be via the tracks of either a single railroad, or over those owned or controlled by multiple railway companies along a continuous route.


Pacific Railroad Acts

The Pacific Railroad Acts of 1862 were a series of acts of Congress that supported the construction of a "transcontinental railroad" (the Pacific Railroad) in the United States. This happened through authorizing issuing government bonds and the grants of land to railroad companies. The War Department under then-Secretary of War Jefferson Davis was authorized by the Congress in 1853 to do surveys of five different potential transcontinental routes from the Mississippi. These surveys ranging from north to south and submitted a massive twelve volume report to Congress with the results in early 1855. However, no route or bill could be agreed upon and passed authorizing the Government's financial support and land grants. This change when the secession of the southern states in 1861 ended their opposition to a central route. The Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 () was the original act. Some of its provisions were changed, expanded, or repealed by four more amending Acts: The Pacific Railroad Act of 1863 (), Pacific Railroad Act of 1864 (), Pacific Railroad Act of 1865 (), and Pacific Railroad Act of 1866 ().

The Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 started federal government land grants directly to corporations; before that act, the land grants were made to the states, for the benefit of corporations.

Pee Wee Gaskins

Donald Henry "Pee Wee" Gaskins Jr. (March 13, 1933 – September 6, 1991) was an American serial killer. He was executed by electrocution by South Carolina in 1991.

Gaskins was born in South Carolina, the last in a string of illegitimate children. Due to his smallness, he was nicknamed "Pee Wee". His youth was characterized by considerable neglect; for instance, when he was one year old, he drank a bottle of kerosene. He grew to 5 foot 2 inch and 130 pounds.

Gaskins' serial crime began before the concept was even realized, as a juvenile, which included along with a group of other youths: robberies, assaults and a gang rape. In prison, he was regularly raped. He escaped from prison in 1955 by sitting in the back of a garbage truck and fled to Florida; he was re-arrested, remanded and paroled in August 1961.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Gaskins murdered several teenaged girls and young women. He was later found guilty of eight counts of murder and sentenced to death by South Carolina. While on death row, Gaskins murdered a fellow death row inmate, earning him the title "Meanest Man in America". Gaskins was put to death in the electric chair by South Carolina on September 6, 1991.

He would use several pseudonyms, posing as a professional photographer to lure his victims with the promise of a modelling career.

Glatman was later found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder by California and sentenced to death, a sentence that he accepted willingly. He specifically asked the warden to do nothing to save his life. He was executed in the gas chamber of San Quentin State Prison on September 18, 1959.


Fuzhou dialect

The Fuzhou dialect (, FR: ), also Foochow, Hokchew, Hok-chiu, or Fuzhounese, is the prestige variety of the Eastern Min branch of Min Chinese spoken mainly in the Mindong region of Eastern Fujian Province.

Fuzhou dialect is also a dialect of Mindong. Unlike Minnan dialect, Fuzhou dialects say that there are fewer people. This is mainly because the social development model of Fuzhou and Minnan is different. Therefore, the two languages spread differently. The eastern part of the country is dominated by agriculture, while southern Fujian has a large number of fisheries.

Fuzhou dialect is popular in the seven counties of Fuzhou in the eastern part of Fujian, Ningde City and Nanping City, as well as Taiwan, Indonesia, Thailand, Brunei, Singapore. In addition, Fuzhou dialect is also popular in many Chinese communities in North America, South America, Europe, and Australia.

Fuzhou dialect is derived from ancient Chinese and medieval Chinese. Due to the large-scale immigration of Han, Jin and Tang Dynasty, these ancient languages merged into the current Fuzhou dialect. Fuzhou dialect has experienced slow and obvious changes in pronunciation and vocabulary in the last 200 years.

In ancient times, Yue people lived along the banks of the Li River. Since the kingdom of Chu destroyed the country, the descendants of the king led some of the subjects to migrate to Fujian and merged with the Yue people into the Yue ethnic group. In 110 BC, the Yue dynasty against Han and was settled by Emperor Wu of Han Dynasty, after which most of the Yue people were moved to the Jianghuai area. During the Western Han Dynasty, the Central Plains Han people entered the shackles for the first time, and merged with the Yue and Yue people. Fuzhou dialect was integrated into the Central Plains dialect.

During the Jin Dynasty, the Central Plains people entered the country for the second time. The Han people and the Yue people further merged. The Han people became the main residents of Fuzhou, and the Central Plains dialect was once again integrated into the Fuzhou dialect.

At the end of the Tang Dynasty, the Han people of the Central Plains entered the country for the third time. Wang tried to establish the Shu Kingdom and strengthened the integration of the Central Plains dialect and the Gan dialect. Fuzhou dialect was basically formed in the Tang Dynasty and is gradually developing.

The Mandarin language movement in recent decades has led to fewer and fewer people in Fuzhou. Recently, the government and civil society have realized this problem and have taken many measures to promote it. According to statistics, half of Fuzhou young people now speak Fuzhou dialect.

The first book on the pronunciation of Fuzhou is the 'Yulin Sounds', which was published in the 17th century and provides a standard for Fuzhou dialect.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Western scholars studied Fuzhou dialect, compiled a dictionary, and translated the Bible into Fuzhou dialect. Japanese scholars published a series of books on Fuzhou dialect in the 1940s. The efforts of Western scholars have developed the use of the Latin alphabet to write Fuzhou dialect, which was standardized in 1890. This set of standards is mainly used in churches.

Victor Licata

Victor Licata (c. 1912 – December 4, 1950) was an American murderer who killed most of his family with an axe. On October 16, 1933 in Ybor City, Tampa, Florida, Licata used an axe to murder his parents, two brothers, and a sister while they were asleep. All died from blows to the head. The killings, which were reported by the media as the work of an "axe-murdering marijuana addict", were used as prima facie evidence that there was a link between recreational drugs, such as cannabis, and crime. This led to the killings being used in 1930s anti-drug campaigns against marijuana. At trial, Licata was found criminally insane and committed to an insane asylum, where he later hanged himself in 1950.

Marsha P. Johnson

Marsha P. Johnson (August 24, 1945 – July 6, 1992) was an American gay and transgender rights activist. They are best known for participating in the Stonewall riots in 1969. A founding member of the Gay Liberation Front, Johnson co-founded the advocacy group S.T.A.R. (Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries), alongside their friend Sylvia Rivera. From 1987 through 1992, Johnson was an AIDS activist with ACT UP.

Johnson was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey on August 24, 1945. They were one of seven children. Their father, Malcolm Michaels Sr, worked for General Motors. Their mother, Alberta Claiborne, was a housekeeper. Johnson attended an African Methodist Episcopal Church as a child. Johnson was very religious. They were very interested in Catholicism, and kept a private altar at home. Johnson began wearing dresses at the age of five but stopped due to bullying from boys in their neighborhood. Johnson did not come to terms with being gay until the age of 17. Their mother was reportedly very homophobic, but Johnson has said that their mother was unaware of the LGBT community. After graduating from high school, Johnson moved to Greenwich Village, New York on their own. They supported themself by waiting tables. After meeting other gay people in the city, Johnson gained the confidence to come out themself.

Johnson began working as a drag queen after coming out as gay. They chose the drag name "Marsha P. Johnson". "Johnson" comes from the restaurant Howard Johnson's. They said that the "P" stood for "pay it no mind," a phrase they would use when people asked their gender. Johnson referred to themself as gay, a transvestite, and a drag queen interchangeably and preferred "they," rather than "she," to be used as a pronoun. Although they never referred to themself as being transgender, many modern scholars believe that was only because the term still was rarely used during their lifetime.

Johnson said that their style of drag was not serious because they could not afford expensive clothes. They made flower crowns out of leftover flowers from the Flower District of Manhattan, which they began well known for wearing. Johnson was tall, thin and wore long flowing clothes, red high heels and bright wigs. This tended to draw a lot of attention. Their style was often described as being masculine and feminine at the same time.

In 1972, Johnson became a member of the New York-based drag performance troupe Hot Peaches. Johnson also performed with the troupe The Angels of Light. In 1975, Johnson was photographed by famous artist Andy Warhol, as part of a series called "Ladies and Gentlemen".

The Stonewall riots were a series of riots in New York City in 1969. They happened after the police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village. Johnson is often said to have been one of the first people to begin rioting against the police, some going as far to say they "threw the first brick at Stonewall". Johnson denied this, but they did become heavily involved in gay rights activism after the police raid.

After the Stonewall uprising, Johnson joined the Gay Liberation Front, which worked to fight against homophobia. They participated in a rally on the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots in 1970. Also in 1970, Johnson and their fellow GLF members staged a sit-in protest at New York University after the university staff canceled a dance when they learned it was sponsored by gay organizations. 

Johnson and their close friend Sylvia Rivera co-founded the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) organization. STAR advocated for transgender rights and also provided shelter for gay and transgender youth in the "STAR House", which also provided shelter for sex workers. Johnson worked to provide food, clothing, emotional support and a sense of family for homeless gay and transgender youth.

The two were banned from participating in the gay pride parade in 1973 when the staff running the event stated they were not going to allow drag queens at marches because they were "giving them a bad name". Their response was to march defiantly ahead of the parade. They believed it was their right to participate in pride alongside other members of the LGBT community.

When they first came to New York City, Johnson became a sex worker to make money. They were arrested many times due to laws against prostitution. 

Johnson spoke of first having a mental breakdown in 1970. They would purposefully get themself arrested so that they would be given antipsychotic medication.

Though remembered by most as a kind and generous person, they were known to have occasional bouts of anger and aggression. It is believed that they may have suffered from a mental illness which caused mood swings.

Johnson was found dead shortly after the 1992 pride parade. Their body was discovered floating in the Hudson River. According to their friend, Randy Wicker, a witness saw Johnson fighting a man who later bragged about killing a drag queen named "Marsha". No arrests were made following this. Many locals believed that the law enforcement was unwilling to investigate Johnson's death because of their status as a drag queen and a sex worker.

Johnson was cremated and their ashes were released over the Hudson River by her friends following a funeral at the local church.

In November 2012, activist Mariah Lopez was able to get the New York police department to reopen the case as a possible homicide.

Johnson is remembered by many as an important figure in the fight for gay liberation.

The 2012 documentary "Pay It No Mind – The Life and Times of Marsha P. Johnson" features segments from a 1992 interview with Johnson, which was filmed shortly before their death. Many of their friends from Greenwich Village are interviewed for the documentary.

In 2018 the "New York Times" published a belated obituary for them.

On May 30, 2019, it was announced that Johnson and Sylvia Rivera would be honored with monuments at Greenwich Village, near the site of the Stonewall club.

In June 2019, Johnson was one of fifty American “pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes” inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City’s Stonewall Inn.

Hiatal hernia

A hiatal hernia is a kind of hernia in which abdominal organs, usually the stomach, slip through the diaphragm. This may result in gastroesophageal reflux disease (or GERD) or heartburn. There are other symptoms, like dysphagia (or trouble swallowing) and chest pain. Other problems may include bowel obstruction and iron deficiency anemia.

The most common risk factors are obesity and older age. Other risk factors are scoliosis, injury and several types of surgery.

Between ten and eighty percent of people in the United States are affected with hiatal hernias.

The symptoms from a hiatal hernia might be improved by changes, like weight loss, changing eating patterns and raising the head of a bed.

Sliding hiatal hernia:- This happens when part of the stomach and the place where the stomach and esophagus meet slide up into chest through the opening (hiatus).

Paraesophageal hernia:- Happens when part of stomach pushes up through the opening (hiatus) into chest and is next to the esophagus.


Scoliosis

Scoliosis is a medical condition in which the human or animal spine has a sideways curve. The curve is usually S-shaped or C-shaped. In some, the curve is stable. In others, though, 
it increases over time. Mild scoliosis does not often cause problems. Severe cases, however, can interfere with breathing and can cause pain.

The cause of most cases is unknown. However, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include having affected family members.

Diagnosis is often confirmed with x-rays.

Scoliosis usually occurs between ages 10 and 20. Males can be affected, although females are more often affected.

Environmental factor

An environmental factor (also called eco factor) is any factor which influences living organisms. Abiotic factors include ambient temperatures, the amounts of sunlight and PH of water soil in which organisms live. Biotic factors include the availability of food organisms and the presence of predators, parasites and competitors.

Cancers are often related to environmental factors. Having a healthy diet, healthy weight, limiting alcoholic drinks and quitting or not starting smoking cuts down the risks of getting cancer.

Environmental triggers for asthma and autism have been studied also.

Consortium

A consortium (which may also be called syndicate) is formed by two or more independent companies, individuals, or other economic actors that work together for a limited amount of time, usually to fulfill a purpose. Consortia are common in the building industries, roads and bridges are often built by consortia.

Very broadly speaking there are two kinds of consortia:
The term can be traced to the 16th century, where it developed from "con sortes", which is the plural of Latin "consors". It can roughly be translated as "united by fate". The english word consort probably has the same origin.

The company Airbus started as a consortium of different companies with the aim of building airplanes. 

In 1970, they officially formed a "groupement d'intérêt économique" (which is a consortium, in the French legal system). Today, Airbus is a Societas Europaea, a shareholding company under European law. Not all consortia are done for profit: The Unicode consortium wants to promote the Unicode standard. It is a non-profit organisation, based in California.

Graph coloring

Graph coloring is the name for a number of problems from graph theory. These problems are concerned with coloring (or labelling) the vertices of a graph, given certain conditions. A simple problem in this context might look for the minimal number of colors needed to color the vertices, when two connected vertices cannot have the same color. In the graph shown, the circles are called vertices and the lines connecting them are called edges. The minimum number of colors needed to color a graph is called its chromatic number.

Cabbage Patch Kids

The Cabbage Patch Kids are a line of soft-sculptured dolls. They were registered in the United States' copyright office in 1978 as 'The Little People'. When the dolls went into mass production in 1982, they were then renamed 'Cabbage Patch Kids'.

The doll brand was one of the most popular toy trends of the 1980s. It was one of the longest running doll franchises in the United States. The characters showed up in many other Cabbage Patch products, including animated cartoons, board games and record albums.

Over the years, the Cabbage Patch Kids have been produced by different companies.

Infidelity

People who form a couple, or who are married, very often have an agreement that they will only have sex with each other, and with no one else. If one of the two has sex with someone else, this is called infidelity.

Infidelity is common: About half of the men, and a quarter of women reported having an extra-marital affair, according to the Kinsey Reports, done in the 1950s.

In many countries, where religion is still present in everyday life (mostly in Africa and Asia), being untrue to the one you love is a criminal offense. In most European countries and the Americas, it is no longer a crime punishable by law.

Infidelity is one the reasons and causes for divorce.

Yuriy Meshkov

Yuri Alexandrovich Meshkov (, ("Yuri Alexandrovich Meshkov"); October 25, 1945 – September 29, 2019) was a Crimean politician. He was a leader of the pro-Russian movement in Crimea. Meshkov was the only President of Crimea from 1994 to 1995.

Yuri Meshkov was born on October 25, 1945 in Synelnykove, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Ukraine (now Ukraine) of a mother of Ukrainian origin and a Russian father of Kossan Cossacks. He grew up in Simferopol, where he finished high school. When he was about eight years old, the Crimea region was officially transferred from the Russian RSFS to the Ukrainian SSR. For his military duties, he served in the Border Guard. In 1967 (in some sources in 1977), he graduated from the Faculty of Law of the Moscow State University. Until 1982, he worked as a detective and then as chief inspector in the district attorney's office. From 1982 to 1985, he spent time on the Skif scientific research yacht. After 1985 and until 1990, he worked privately as a legal consultant. At that time, he was also one of the heads of the "Memorial" department of the Crimean Illuminating Society "All-Union" and president of the Crimean kick-boxing Federation.

In 1990, Meshkov was elected deputy to the Supreme Council of Crimea (the parliament of the republic). There, he became the co-founder of the RDK (Republican Crimean Movement) party. In 1994, he headed the electoral block "Russia" for the Republican presidential elections, where he easily defeated Mykola Bahrov in the second round. Mykola Bahrov was at that time head of the Supreme Council of Crimea. In the second round of the presidential elections in Crimea in 1994, Meshkov won 72.9% and was elected only president of the republic.

Its main political program was to facilitate much closer relations with the Russian Federation until the possible reunification of Crimea with Russia. Mechkov tried to initiate a political-military union with Russia and completely ignored the positions of the Ukrainian government. He also tried to force the rotation of the Russian currency, issue Russian passports to the population of Crimea and even transfer Crimea to the same time zone as Moscow. Due to the unexpected resistance of the local opposition, Meshkov only managed to place his autonomous republic in the Moscow time zone. He also appointed the Deputy Prime Minister, Russian economist Yevgeny Saburov, who has practically become the head of government. He then said in confrontations with other government officials about the legitimacy of his designee that he did not even have a Ukrainian passport. Because of this, Yevgeny Saburov was forced to resign. After that, he managed to paralyze the work of the Supreme Council of Crimea.

In 1995, the Ukrainian Parliament repealed the Crimean Constitution and abolished the office of president on March 17, 1995. After some previous warnings in September and November 1994 on March 17, 1995, the President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma , signed the law of Ukraine that repeals the amended Constitution of Crimea and some other laws of the Republic of Crimea, because they were contrary to the Constitution of Ukraine and jeopardized the sovereignty of Ukraine.

Muff

A muff is a tube made of fur or other warm material into which the hands are placed for warmth.

They are rarely used today. Changes in fashion might be one reason. Also, vehicles which transport people today are usually heated. 

In Roman times, the place of the glove was taken by long sleeves (manicae) reaching to the hand, and in winter special sleeves of fur were worn. In Medieval Latin we find the word muffulae, defined by Du Cange as chirothecae pellitae et hibernae ("leather winter gloves"). He quotes from a cartulary of the year 817, of the issuing to monks of sheepskin coverings to be used during the winter. These may have been, as the Roman certainly were, separate coverings for each hand, although the cartulary referred to also tells apart the glove for summer from the muffulae for winter wear. The Old French moufle meant a thick glove or mitten, and from this the Dutch mof, Walloon mouffe, and from that time, English "muff", are probably made from.

Armando Villanueva

Armando Villanueva Del Campo (25 November 1915 – 14 April 2013) was a Peruvian politician. He was the leader of the Peruvian American Popular Revolutionary Alliance. Villanueva was born in Lima. He was the Prime Minister of Peru from 17 May 1988 through 15 May 1989 during Alan García's first presidency. 

At the age of 15 Villanueva became a member of APRA's "Juventud Aprista Peruana" in opposition to the military dictatorship of Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro. At the age of 18 he was imprisoned in El Frontón prison (located on the small island of "San Lorenzo" off the coast of Callao, Lima's main port) for his subversive activities in Peru. He was a political ally and personal friend of Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, the founder and most prominent leader of the APRA party.

Villanueva spent most of his early life in different prisons for his political activities. In 1940, along with other APRA political activists, Villanueva was exiled to Chile. Between the 1940s and 1960s Villanueva spent his time in between Peruvian prisons and deportations to Chile and Argentina. While living in Santiago he met and married Lucia Ortega. They had a daughter: Lucia del Pilar Villanueva Ortega. 

In late 1961, before a general amnesty was granted to members of APRA, Villanueva entered Peru secretly. He needed to start organizing the multiple party cells in preparation for their return to full political activities. Afraid that he would be caught, he sought refuge at his cousin's house in San Isidro. Ana Maria Villanueva de Riva-Vercellotti was married to an Italian, and Armando was convinced that Peru's secret police would never find him there. He was able to stay there, unperturbed, till full amnesty was granted.

From 1963 to 1968 Villanueva served as a deputy in the lower house of the Peruvian legislature representing Lima, serving as President of the Chamber of Deputies from 1967 to 1968. Villanueva led the Aprista opposition to the military government of Juan Velasco.

The death of Haya de la Torre in 1979 propelled Villanueva to the leadership of the APRA party. As leader of the party Villanueva ran for the presidency in 1980 resulting in a second-place loss to the "Popular Action" party candidate Fernando Belaúnde. It is said that he lost the elections because the opposition mounted a negative campaign against him, claiming that he was married to a Chilean-born citizen. Chile's victory in the "Guerra del Pacifico" in 1883, which resulted in Peru losing a large chunk of its southern border to Chile, is still a subject of bad feeling in Peru.

In 1985 Villanueva was elected to the Peruvian Senate and elected as the President of the Senate from July 1986 to July 1987. During the presidency of Alan García, he served as prime minister from 1988 to 1989. In 1990, Villanueva was elected to his last term in the Senate, from 1990 to 1992 when Alberto Fujimori shut down Congress.

Villanueva retired in 2005, at the age of 90, to dedicate the rest of his life to his family and writing. In May 2005, with the death of his cousin Ana Maria, he also assumed the title of family patriarch. Villanueva died of a heart attack in Lima on 14 April 2013 at the age of 97.

He found a backpack filled with three pipe bombs on the park grounds, Jewell called the police and helped to evacuate the area before the bomb exploded, saving many people from injury or death. 

After the bombing, Jewell was seen as a hero but later he was viewed as a suspect, before being cleared. Jewell's case is considered an example of the damage that can be done by media reporting based on unreliable or incomplete information.

Despite never being charged, the media continued to criticize Jewell and calling him the suspected bomber. Jewell was eventually found not guilty, and Eric Rudolph was later found to have been the bomber. 

In 2006, Governor Sonny Perdue publicly thanked Jewell on behalf of the State of Georgia for saving the lives of those at the Olympics.

Safety razor

A safety razor is a shaving implement with a protective device put between the edge of the blade and the skin. The reason for the protective devices was to make it easier for people to shave without getting hurt. This made professional barbers less needed. The term was first used in a patent issued in 1880.

Plastic disposable razors and razors with replaceable blade attachments are in common use today. Razors commonly include one to five cutting edges, which are sharp.

Safety razors first had an edge protected by a comb patterned on different types of protective guards that had been placed to open-blade straight razors during the preceding decades.

To maintain the sharpness, razors can be stropped using an old strip of denim.

Safety razors are usually made of razor steel. That is a low chromium stainless steel, and it can be made very sharp. However, it corrodes easily. Drying the blades after using them can make them last longer. Salt from human skin also can corrode the blades, but washing and carefully drying them can make them last longer.

Disposable product

A disposable (also called disposable product) is a product designed to be used only once, and then it would be recycled or is thrown away as solid waste. The word often implies cheapness and short-term convenience instead of something that will last for a long time. The term is also sometimes used for products that may last several months (e.g. disposable air filters) to distinguish from similar things that last forever (e.g. washable air filters).

"Disposable" is an "adjective" meaning "something not reuseable but is disposed of after use". Many people now use the word as a noun or substantive (i.e. "a disposable") but it is still an adjective. This is because the "noun" (product, nappy, etc.) is implied.


Cannonball Run

Cannonball Run is a 1981 American Hong Kong action comedy movie starring Burt Reynolds, Jackie Chan, Dom DeLuise and Farah Fawcett.


Disposable and discretionary income

Disposable income is the income someone has after they have paid their taxes. Mathematically, it is total personal income minus personal current taxes. In national accounts definitions, personal income minus personal current taxes equals disposable personal income.


Autonomous consumption

Autonomous consumption (also exogenous consumption) is when people are paying for things when they have no income. In other words, it is the consumption expenditure that happens when income levels are zero. Such consumption is considered autonomous of income only when spending on these consumables does not change much income is changed; generally, it may be needed to pay for things that are needed and pay off debt. If income levels are actually zero, this consumption is called dissaving. This is because it is paid for by borrowing or using up savings. Autonomous consumption is different from induced consumption because it does not consistently change with income, whereas induced consumption does. The two are related, for all households, through the consumption function:

where


Consumption function

In economics, the consumption function shows a relationship between consumption and disposable income. It is believed that John Maynard Keynes introduced the idea in macroeconomics in 1936. He used it to develop the idea of a government spending multiplier. 

Its simplest form is the "linear consumption function". It is used often in simple Keynesian models:

where formula_2 is the autonomous consumption that is independent of disposable income; in other words, consumption when there is no income. The term formula_3 is the induced consumption that is influenced by the economy's income level. It is generally assumed that there is no correlation or dependence between formula_4 and "C".



Induced consumption

Induced consumption is the part of consumption that changes with disposable income. It is when there is a change in disposable income “induces” (persuades or makes someone want to do something) a change in consumption on goods and services. In contrast, spending for autonomous consumption do not change with income. For example, spending on a consumable that is considered a normal good would be considered to be induced.

In the simple linear consumption function,

formula_1

induced consumption is represented by the term formula_2, where formula_3 shows disposable income. formula_4 is called the marginal propensity to consume.

Ferrodraco

Ferrodraco lentoni, "Lenton's Iron Dragon", is a species of pterosaur. The only known fossil of the pterosaur was found in 2017 north east of Winton, Queensland, Australia. 

The pterosaur had a wingspan of about four metres, and when on the ground walked on its four limbs. The name, "Ferrodraco lentoni", comes from the Latin word, "ferrum" (iron), for the ironstone in which the fossil was found, and "draco", the Latin word for dragon. The species also is named after Graham Thomas 'Butch' Lenton, who was the mayor of Winton. 

Only small parts of 15 different pterosaurs have been found in Australia. "Ferrodraco" is the most complete specimen found. Scientists have been able to identify five vertebrae, eight limb bones, a large part of the jaw and skull, and 40 teeth. They believe that the pterosaur lived about 96 million years ago. That is in the Upper Cretaceous. 

The fossil is similar to pterosaurs found in England, except that it has much smaller teeth. This might be because of the type of food it ate, perhaps a diet of fish. Bones of pterosaurs were thin, and hollow, and because of this, very few have survived. 

Winton is well known as an area where dinosaur fossils are found, but this was the first pterosaur discovered here.

Marginal propensity to consume

In economics, the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is a measurement that can put induced consumption into numbers. Induced consumption is the idea that an increase in personal consumer spending (consumption) happens with an increase in disposable income (income after taxes and transfers). The proportion of disposable income which people spend on consumption is called the propensity to consume. MPC is the proportion of more income that a person spends. For example, if a household earns one extra dollar of disposable income, and the marginal propensity to consume is 0.65, then the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents of that dollar. Obviously, the household cannot spend "more" than the extra dollar (without borrowing).

John Maynard Keynes says that the marginal propensity to consume is less than one.

The MPC is higher for poorer people than in rich.

Mathematically, the formula_1 function is written as the derivative of the consumption function formula_2 with respect to disposable income formula_3, i.e., the instantaneous slope of the formula_2-formula_3 curve.

or, approximately,

Marginal propensity to consume can be found by dividing change in consumption by a change in income, or formula_10. The MPC can be explained with the simple example:
Here formula_11; formula_12
Therefore, formula_13 or 83%.
For example, suppose you receive a bonus with your paycheck, and it's $500 on top of your normal annual earnings. You now have $500 more in income than you did before. If you decide to spend $400 of this marginal increase in income on something, your marginal propensity to consume will be 0.8 (formula_14).



Consumer spending

Consumer spending, consumption, or consumption expenditure is when people buy goods and services. It is the biggest part of aggregate demand in macroeconomics. There are two parts of consumer spending: induced consumption (which is changed by the level of income) and autonomous consumption (which is not).

In the United States, the Consumer Spending figure published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis includes three big categories of personal spending.

Aggregate demand

In macroeconomics, Aggregate Demand (AD) or Domestic Final Demand (DFD) is the total demand for final goods and services in an economy at a time. This is the demand for the gross domestic product of a country. It shows the amount of goods and services that will be bought at all possible different prices.


Tommy Douglas

Thomas Clement Douglas (20 October 1904 – 24 February 1986) was a Canadian socialist politician from Saskatchewan. 

Douglas founded a political party called the CCF representing socialism and the working class. Douglas was elected Premier of Saskatchewan and created universal healthcare for it. Douglas’s health plan was copied by other provinces and spread to all of Canada. Douglas also created a Socialist political party called the New Democratic Party or NDP. 

Douglas is generally very respected because he created Canada’s universal healthcare system but recently some people have suggested that he should not be that praised because in the 1930’s he was a supporter of eugenics.

The Eisenhower Executive Office Building, formerly known as the Old Executive Office Building, and the State, War, and Navy Building, is a U.S. government building situated just west of the White House in the U.S. capital of Washington, D.C.

The building was commissioned by President Ulysses S. Grant. It was built between 1871 and 1888, on the site of the original 1800 War/State/Navy Building and the White House stables.

Wolfe + 988 Sr., Hubert Blaine Wolfe+585 Sr., and Hubert Blaine Wolfe+590 Sr., among others) is the shortened name of a man who has had the record for the longest personal name ever used. Hubert's given name is made up from 27 names. Each of those names start with a different letter of the alphabet in alphabetical order; these are followed by an very longword surname.

He is also known to have been a member of the American Name Society for a while.

His name first got attention when it was shown in the 1938 Philadelphia telephone directory on page 1292, column 3, line 17, and in a court order of judge John Boyle of May 25, 1938: "Wolfe­schlegel­stein­hausen­berger­dorff, Jr., etc., vs. Yellow Cab Co., petition for compromise settlement granted"—with people believing that the case was settled because "they couldn't pronounce it".

In the 1970s and 1980s, Wolfe­schlegel­stein­hausen­berger­dorff appeared in the "Guinness Book of World Records" as having the longest personal name. His picture was taken for the book in front of a New York City marquee displaying his name. His name was misspelled. but was all of this true?

Geometer moth

Geometer moths are a large family of moths in the Lepidoptera. Over 23,000 species have been described. Most of them are nocturnal: only a few are active during the day. 

The imagos (adults) have wingspans between and . Their caterpillars move in a special way, they seem to "measure the earth". For this reason, the caterpillars are sometimes called inchworms. 

A well-known species is the peppered moth ("Biston betularia"). Many species are classified as pests.

Many geometrids have slender abdomens and broad wings which are usually held flat with the hindwings visible. They look a bit like butterflies, but in most respects they are typical moths. Most fly at night. They have a frenulum to link the wings, and the antennae of the males are often feathered. They blend into the background with camouflage. In some species, females have reduced wings.

Most caterpillars have four pairs of feet in their central section but geometer moth caterpillars only have two. This means that they are unable to move like the other caterpillars. They use the front pair of feet to hold on to a support, and then they pull the rest of their body up close. Next, they use the pairs of feet in the back part of their body to hold on, and push the front part forward. This means they are often in a position which looks like the Greek letter Omega, as can be seen in the photo. 

Key derivation function

In cryptography, a key derivation function (KDF) makes a long secret key (which is called a "hash") from a secret phrase, like a password. The output of a key derivation function will look common to another result made from a random phrase. They are also used to re-use secret keys in a specific format, like using a shared secret key from the Diffie–Hellman key exchange for sending secrets in AES.

Key derivation functions are important in security. They allow a smaller "secret phrase" to be expanded into a larger key (of a fixed length decided by the KDF's digest size). This makes trying to find the original "secret phrase" more difficult. The length of the key makes it more difficult to discover the phrase or the hidden secret by trial and error (i.e. through brute-forcing), by making it difficult for a computer to guess. Sometimes, a small piece of random data (called a "salt") is added to the secret phrase before it is used with a KDF to make it more difficult guess the original "secret phrase" with a list of known "hashes".

It makes checking passwords safer without using the real password. Instead of keeping the real password, a "hash" of the key is kept and when checking the password, the "hash" of the real password is checked with the input. Some software put a limit on the length of a password and is sometimes used to make larger secret phrases smaller. KDFs are also made in a way so that, it takes a computer some effort to make the "hash". This makes making a list of potential combinations difficult.

COX-2 inhibitors

COX-2 inhibitors are a special type of analgesic. Cyclooxygenase (commonly abbreviated as COX) is an enzyme that has an important role in starting an inflammation and pain. There are many different types of COX; the most common are known as COX-1 and COX-2. NSAIDs work by blocking COX. The problem with blocking all COX is that COX-1 is also used to regulate kidney function. Blocking COX-1 runs the risk of bleeding of the stomach, and reduction of the kidney function. COX-2 inhibitors only block COX-2, and do not have an effect on COX-1.. Clinical studies have shown that they increase the risk of a heart attack, and of a stroke. Several COX-2 inhibitors have been taken off the market, because of these side-effects. 

Other than as an analgesic, COX-2 inhibitors have also been used in the treatment of cancer, and of some neurological conditions, such as depression, and schizophrenia.

Because of the severe side-effects, COX-2 inhibitors are usually only available with a prescription.

Mad scientist

A mad scientist is a fictional character who is a genius, but who wants to find out and do what no one else ever has and often what he should not. The character Victor Frankenstein is often said to be the first mad scientist, though Coppelius from The Sandman (short story) could also be called a mad scientist and The Sandman was published a year before Frankenstein was. 

They often work with fictional technology, they either fail to recognise the dangers of their actions or don't care about the consequences, and some attempt to play God.

Mad scientists are often shown as evil (evil genius) or insane. Some may be neutral or good, even if their actions are dangerous and irresponsible, which can make them mad scientists.

First battle of Panipat

Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi in the first battle of Panipat in 1526. In this Babur used the Rumi (Ottoman) device of lashing a large number of carts to form a defending wall with breastwork in between to rest guns (Tughlama system of welfare). His artillery was led by Ustad Ali and Mustafa. It marked the beginning of the Mughal Empire. This was one of the earliest battles involving gun powder firearms and field artillery.

The Mughal forces of Babur, the Timurid ruler of Kabulistan, defeated the much larger ruling army of Ibrahim Lodi, Sultan of Delhi. The battle was fought on 21 April near the small village of Panipat, in the present day Indian state of Haryana, an area that has been the site of a number of decisive battles for the control of Northern India since the twelfth century.

The use of guns by troops of Babur helped them claim victory in the battle. The Lodi troops were lagging in terms of artillery skills and the sound emitted by canons frightened the war elephants of Lodi.

Electronic Frontier Foundation

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is an international non-profit based in San Francisco, United States. It was started in July 1990 by John Gilmore, John Perry Barlow and Mitch Kapor to promote Internet freedoms.

The EFF sponsors legal defense, defends individuals and new technology from unfair legal threats. It also monitors proposals that may weaken internet freedoms and liberties. It also monitors for possible weakening of fair use.

One of the first high profile cases of the EFF was "Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service." In early 1990, Steve Jackson Games was under a massive search and seizure operation. Copies of the game GURPS Cyberpunk was considered as proof by mistake. Emails were also modified and were a new technology at the time. It was not considered to be protected by the right to personal privacy at the time.

"Bernstein v. United States" was the second large case of the EFF. Programmer Daniel J. Bernstein had sued the US Government for permission to release his cryptographic software against limits put by the government.

During the mid-1990s, the United States Government did not allow for international use of any cryptographic product unless the ciphertext could be decrypted by a third-party with a promise that the government could not read messages protected by the Data Encryption Standard (DES) even after it was shown as weak and broken. The EFF had made a piece of hardware called the "EFF DES Cracker" that could crack a message within 24 hours.

The plans and source code were made public.

The EFF has made software and browser add-ons like Switzerland, HTTPS Everywhere, and Privacy Badger.

E. D. Hirsch

E. D. Hirsch is Eric Donald Hirsch Jr. (; born March 22, 1928. He is an American educator and academic literary critic. He is professor emeritus of education and humanities at the University of Virginia. 

In the 1960s Hirsch's "Validity in Interpretation" made an important work to contemporary literary theory and he was called "the founder of contemporary intentionalism". 

In popular culture Hirsch is best known for his work on cultural literacy, and is the founder and chairman of the Core Knowledge Foundation. 
He is a long-term critic of American schools, and promotes ideas for improving the education of children. His "The Schools We Need: And Why We Don't Have Them" (1996) was hated by the liberal left. It also managed to annoy the right wing because it attacked the local control of schools. in 2016 he published " Why Knowledge Matters: Rescuing our Children from Failed Educational Theories". This outlined three major problems with education in the United States. These are, according to him, the emphasis on teaching skills, such as critical thinking skills, rather than knowledge, individualism rather than communal learning, and developmentalism, that is, teaching children what is "appropriate" for their age.

Beginning in 1990s, Hirsch began publishing books in the "Core Knowledge Grader Series" which the Foundation describes as "an engaging, illustrated guide to the essential knowledge outlined in the Core Knowledge Sequence". This series of books was received well by parents educating children at home, and it has been adopted by many school systems.
Sol Stern, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who has written extensively on education reform, wrote in 2013 that Hirsch was "the most important education reformer of the past half-century."

Estimator

In statistics, an estimator is a rule for calculating an estimate of a given amount based on observed data. The rule (the estimator), the amount that is being measured (the estimand) and its result (the estimate) are different.

An estimator of a parameter formula_1 is often written as formula_2. If the expected value of the estimator is equal to the parameter, then the estimator is called unbiased. Otherwise, it is called biased.



Statistical parameter

A statistical parameter or population parameter is an amount put into the probability distribution of a statistic or a random variable. It can be thought of as a numbered amount of a trait of a statistical population or a statistical model.

A statistical parameter is different from its estimator in that the parameter is a fixed amount, while the value of an estimator changes according to some probability distribution. The notations formula_1 (for the parameter) and formula_2 (for the estimator) are often used to clarify this distinction.


Efficiency (statistics)

In the comparison of statistical procedures, efficiency is a measure of an estimator's quality. This would be about the estimator of an experimental design, or of a hypothesis testing procedure. Basically, a more efficient estimator, experiment, or test needs fewer observations than a less efficient one to get a given performance.

Method of moments (statistics)

In statistics, the method of moments is a method of estimation of population parameters.

Suppose that the problem is to estimate formula_1 unknown parameters formula_2 describing the distribution formula_3 of the random variable formula_4. Suppose the first formula_1 moments of the true distribution (the "population moments") can be expressed as functions of the formula_6s:

Suppose a sample of size formula_8 is drawn, and it leads to the values formula_9. For formula_10, let 
be the "j"-th sample moment, an estimate of formula_12. The method of moments estimator for formula_13 denoted by formula_14 is defined as the solution (if there is one) to the equations: 

The method of moments is simple and gets consistent estimators (under very weak assumptions). However, these estimators are often biased.

Parks and Recreation

Parks and Recreation is a television sitcom. It was on TV from April 9, 2009 to February 24, 2015, with a special reunion episode airing on April 30, 2020. During this time, it showed 126 episodes over seven seasons. It ran on the channel NBC. It was created by Greg Daniels and Michael Schur. The show is about a group of people who live in a fictional town called Pawnee in the state of Indiana. They work in the government of Pawnee, in the Department of Parks and Recreation. The main character of the show is Leslie Knope. She is an optimistic person who loves her job and the city of Pawnee. The actress who plays her is Amy Poehler. There are many other characters in the show. They are: Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones), Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider), Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari), Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman), April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza), Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt), Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott), Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe), Jerry Gergich (Jim O'Heir), Donna Meagle (Retta), and Craig Middlebrooks (Billy Eichner).

The series changed as time went on. The writers wanted to make the show like real life. To do this, they learned about how governments of cities really worked. They also talked about current political issues in episodes of the show. For example, one episode has the government of Pawnee shut down. This means that there is not enough money for the government to work correctly, so it stops doing everything that is not very important. The writers put this in the show because of a real government shutdown. The real shutdown happened because of a financial crisis in 2007-2008, and this was the same time that the episode was being written. Sometimes, real politicians also acted on the show. Joe Biden, John McCain, and Michelle Obama were some of the politicians who did this. The characters in the show also changed. Some people watched the first season and thought that Leslie Knope was too ditzy—that is, unintelligent and unable to do her job correctly. So the writers changed the way they showed Leslie. They wanted viewers to know she really was smart. During the show, many of the characters have changing romantic relationships and get different jobs. They changed just like people change in real life.

The first season only had six episodes. It got mixed reviews. People thought some things about it were good, and some things about it were bad. Many people thought it was too much like "The Office." Like "Parks and Recreation, The Office" was another sitcom that Daniels created. But after the first season, it got positive reviews. Many people thought it was good, and it won many awards. It was nominated for an Emmy Award 14 times. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series—Musical or Comedy. It won a Golden Globe Award for the good job Poehler 
did playing Leslie Knope.

Drosophilidae

The Drosophilidae is a huge, widespread (cosmopolitan) family of flies, which includes the famous fruit flies. The family has over 4000 species in 75 genera. A recent publication lists the species:

There is another unrelated family of flies, the Tephritidae, which includes species also known as "fruit flies".

The best known species of the Drosophilidae is "Drosophila melanogaster". This species and its relatives are often used for studies on genetics, development, physiology, and behaviour.

"D. melanogaster" is not so much studied in the field as in the laboratory. The best-known studies of "Drosophila" in a natural environment was done by Dobzhansky and colleagues on "Drosophila pseudoobscura" from the early 1930s to 1970. Reprints and discussions are in Lewontin "et al" 2003, and theoretical discussions in Dobzhansky, 1970.

The cells of fruit flies usually do not divide after the imago is hatched. The fruit fly is mostly composed of post-mitotic cells, has a very short lifespan, and shows gradual ageing. As in other species, temperature influences the life history of the animal. They live longer in colder weather. Several genes can be manipulated to extend the lifespan of these insects.

The Drosophilidae has two subfamilies, the Drosophilinae and the Steganinae.

Sara Danius

Sara Maria Danius (5 April 1962 – 12 October 2019) was a Swedish scholar of literature, aesthetics and former member of the Nobel prize in literature committee.

Danius was a member of the Swedish Academy and its first female permanent secretary. She was one of the central figures in the 2018 controversies resulting in the cancellation of the Nobel Prize in Literature that year and the following restructuring of the academy. She was born in Täby.

Danius died on 12 October 2019, aged 57, after having suffered from breast cancer for several years.



Steganinae

The Steganinae is the smaller of two subfamilies in the fruit fly family Drosophilidae. The other subfamily is the Drosophilinae.

Drosophilinae

The Drosophilinae are the largest subfamily in the Drosophilidae. The other subfamily is the Steganinae.

A huge amount of research has shown the way the fly has evolved many species as it spread across the world.

The genus "Drosophila" is paraphyletic because several genera (with many species), such as "Zaprionus", "Scaptomyza" and "Lordiphosa", are within the genus. What this means is that they have evolved from more standard "Drosophila" over time. This is pretty well supported by the evidence of their genome.

In taxonomy, there are two ways of solving this kind of problem:
Genus "Drosophila" could be raised to a supergenus, or the related offshoot genera could be demoted to subgenera.

Sugarcane juice

Sugarcane juice is the liquid extracted from pressed sugarcane. Especially, in places where sugarcane is grown commercially, it is a popular drink. Today, most sugarcane comes from Southeast Asia, India, Northern Africa, and Latin America. In Spanish-speaking countries, sugarcane juice is usually called Guarapo, or guarapa. In Portugese, it is called garapa. These names can also refer to palm syrup. 

In the United States where processed sugarcane syrup is used as a sweetener in food and beverage manufacturing, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers "evaporated cane juice" to be a misleading term for "sugar" on product labels. The FDA regards "juice" as a liquid derived from fruits or vegetables, so the preferred term is "cane sugar".

In Brazil, laboratories use sugarcane juice to make ethanol fuel.

Contreras was at that time one of the two choices who would succeed Barrow as Leader of the UDP, if he were to resign then. The other choice was Shadow Minister of Police and the Army, Michael Finnegan. After the UDP won the 2006 municipal election, Barrow kept his promise and remained as UDP Leader.

Contreras had the support of Prime minister, Manuel Esquivel and Former UDP Leader, Dean Lindo, while Valdez was backed by Deputy prime minister, Barrow and Minister of Police and the Army, Michael Finnegan (Belizean politician). In the end, Contreras won 1,537 votes to Valdez’s 1,527 votes. Contreras then prepared himself to face Amin Hegar of the People’s United Party (PUP) in the 1998 Belizean general election who had been the MP for Cayo West for over five years. Contreras had a disadvantage and new that the road to Cayo West was not easy. He was even criticised for “lack of experience”. When Esquivel called the election, Contreras led his People in a March from Cinderella Plaza through downtown Belize City to the Island. It was a very Successful March which energised his Party. After the March concluded, Lindo spoke to News 5 and said that he has full confidence that Contreras will win and deliver Cayo West for his People. Public support for Contreras indicated that he was going to win his Constituency with a Landslide victory. However that all changed on Election Day. It was found that Contreras had allegedly handed out leases to over four hundred lots on Election Day and this constituted Bribery under the Election laws. The written Opinion in the case has not yet been released. After a determined Campaign, Contreras emerged Victorious, gaining 1,537 votes to Hegar’s 1,527 votes retiring the one term MP. Bucking a National trend, Contreras as the Only UDP Candidate to defeat a PUP House Incumbent In 1998 and one of the only three UDP members elected nationwide that Year. After the UDP’s Landslide lost in the 1998 election, Esquivel resigned as UDP Leader and the Party had only three suitable candidates for the post. A The first being Front-runner, Barrow who was considered favourite in the race and the others being, Finnegan and Contreras. Both declined the offer to run for Party Leader and instead Contreras submitted his Nomination to run for Second Deputy Leader of the UDP and so the Party had no other option but to elect Barrow as their Leader. Barrow formed his Shadow cabinet comprising with just three Opposition Ministers. He appointed Contreras as Shadow Minister of Economic Development, Investment and Traderesponsible for aguing with Minister, Ralph Fonseca on issues concerning the Budget planning and management, Economic development, Investment and Trade. Contreras discharged his duties in the portfolio faithfully and eagerly. In 1999, he provided free Petrol to cars in his Constituency and reduced the sales of Vechicals by $1000. As a result, many of his constituents were able to afford them. In 2000, he officially opened a Sewing shop in Benque Viejo del Carmen. Soon the 2003 general election came, and it was time for Contreras to secure another term in Cayo West. He was endorsed unopposed as Standard-Bareer for the Constituency In 2002.

Multirole combat aircraft

A multirole combat aircraft (MRCA) is a military airplane designed for more than one purpose. A multirole fighter is a multirole combat aircraft that can be used to attack enemy airplanes.

The term "multirole" is the ability for the airplane to perform more than one task or combat role. Many times airplanes will be designed for one task, and later someone will make small changes to the airplane to perform a different task. For example, the F-15 Eagle was first designed as an air superiority fighter to destroy other enemy fighters. Many years later its designers made changes to allow it to carry bombs and missiles and attack targets on the ground.

In the European Union, English is one of 24 official languages and is widely used by institutions, and by almost all of the population as the native language in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is a second language in other member states.

Estimates that include second language speakers vary greatly, from 470 million to more than 2 billion. David Crystal calculates that, as of 2003, non-native speakers outnumbered native speakers by a ratio of 3 to 1. When combining native and non-native speakers, English is the most widely spoken language worldwide.

Besides the main dialects of English, countries such as South Africa, India, Nigeria, the Philippines, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago have millions of native speakers of dialect continua. These versions range from English-based creole languages to Standard English. Other countries such as Ghana and Uganda also use English as their primary official languages.

India now claims to be the world's second-largest English-speaking country. The most reliable estimate is about 10% of its population or 125 million people, second only to the US. It may be four times larger in the next decade from 2012.

The belt contains bright stars in many constellations including (in order going more or less eastward) Cepheus, Lacerta, Perseus, Orion, Canis Major, Puppis, Vela, Carina, Crux (the Southern Cross), Centaurus, Lupus, and Scorpius (including the Scorpius-Centaurus Association). 

Star-forming regions with bright O and B stars make up the Gould Belt. These regions include the Orion Nebula and the Orion molecular clouds, the Scorpius-Centaurus OB Association, Cepheus OB2, Perseus OB2, and the Taurus-Auriga Molecular Clouds. 

A theory proposed around 2009 suggests that the Gould Belt formed about 30 million years ago when a blob of dark matter collided with the molecular cloud in our region. There is also evidence for similar Gould belts in other galaxies.



Drosophila subobscura

Drosophila subobscura is a species of fruit fly in the family Drosophilidae. 

It was originally found around the Mediterranean, but it has spread to most of Europe and the Near East. It has been introduced into the west coasts of Canada, the United States, and Chile.

In 1933, A.H. Sturtevant captured a species of Drosophila in England. It was a member of "Drosophila subobscura".

"D. subobscura", with others in its species group, is a model organism for evolutionary-biological studies. Its genetics and ecology have been studied for over fifty years.

They have served as favourable models ever since Dobzhansky and his colleagues published their influential works in the 1930s and 40s. 

Their use as a regular laboratory fly was promoted by J.B.S. Haldane and John Maynard Smith at University College London over a period of about 30 years. There it was used for research into population genetics, and for teaching genetics. For many years this species was the European "rival" to the "D. pseudoobscura" favoured by the group in California led by Dobzhansky.

Serbo-Croatian

Serbo-Croatian is the name of a South Slavic language, which is spoken in modern-day Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro. After the breakup of Yugoslavia, it has been divided into four variants. The variants of this language are all based on a single dialect, Shtokavian. Speakers of these variants all understand each other.

Between 1954 and 1992, it was one of the official languages of Yugoslavia (the others were Slovenian and Macedonian). The term Serbo-Croatian was first used in the 1830s. Today, people often speak about Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin languages. Research has also shown that what is called Serbo-Croatian language, is in fact a number of slightly different sub-dialects. People speaking one of the dialects easily understand other people speaking a different dialect. People in Croatia use the Latin alphabet to write the language, while people in other parts use both Latin and Cyrillic alphabets.

Iranian toman

The Iranian toman (; from Mongolian "tomen" 'unit of ten thousand'), is the superunit of the official currency used in Iran, the rial. One toman is equal to ten rials. Even though the rial is the official currency, Iranians use the toman daily.

In the beginning, the toman consisted of 10,000 dinars. Between 1798 and 1825, the toman was split into eight rials, each of 1,250 dinars. In 1825, the qiran was introduced. The qiran was worth 1,000 dinars or one-tenth of a toman.
