A type of UEFI application is an OS boot loader such as GRUB, rEFInd, Gummiboot, and Windows Boot Manager; which loads some OS files into memory and executes them. Also, an OS boot loader can provide a user interface to allow the selection of another UEFI application to run. Utilities like the UEFI Shell are also UEFI applications.

EFI defines protocols as a set of software interfaces used for communication between two binary modules. All EFI drivers must provide services to others via protocols. The EFI Protocols are similar to the BIOS interrupt calls.

The EFI 1.0 specification defined a Universal Graphic Adapter) protocol as a way to support graphics features. UEFI did not include it and replaced it with GOP (Graphics Output Protocol).

UEFI 2.1 defined a "Human Interface Infrastructure" to manage user input, localized strings, fonts, and forms (in the HTML sense). These enable original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or independent BIOS vendors (IBVs) to design graphical interfaces for pre-boot configuration.

Most early UEFI firmware implementations were console-based. Today many UEFI firmware implementations are GUI-based.

SEC – Security Phase is the first stage of the UEFI boot but may have platform specific code. It is built as code written in assembly language for the specific architecture. It initializes temporary memory (often CPU cache as RAM) and serves as the system's software root of trust.

PEI – Pre-EFI Initialization. This second stage of UEFI contains a dependency-aware dispatcher that loads and runs PEI modules to handle hardware tasks such as main memory initialization and firmware recovery operations. It's also responsible for the discovery of the boot mode and handling many ACPI S0ix/ACPI S3 operations. In the case of ACPI S0ix/ACPI S3 resume, it is responsible for restoring many hardware registers to a pre-sleep state. PEI also uses CPU cache as RAM.

DXE – Driver Execution Environment is made of C modules and a dependency-aware dispatcher. With main memory now available, CPU, chipset, mainboard and boot devices are initialized in DXE and BDS.

BDS – Boot Device Select is a part of the DXE. In this stage, boot devices are initialized, UEFI drivers or Option ROMs of PCI devices are executed according to system configuration, and boot options are processed.

TSL – Transient System Load is the stage between boot device selection and hand-off to the OS. At this point one may enter UEFI shell, or execute an UEFI application such as the OS boot loader.

RT – Runtime - The UEFI hands off to the operating system (OS) after is executed. A UEFI compatible OS is now responsible for exiting boot services triggering the firmware to unload all no longer needed code and data, leaving only runtime services code/data, e.g. SMM and ACPI. A typical modern OS will prefer to use its own programs (such as kernel drivers) to control hardware devices.

When a legacy OS is used, CSM will handle this call making sure that the system is compatible with legacy BIOS expectations.

Many digital rights activists have protested against UEFI. Some experts have blamed UEFI as an attempt to remove the ability of the user to control the computer. It does not solve the BIOS's long-standing problems of requiring two different drivers—one for the firmware and one for the operating system—for most hardware.

Open-source project TianoCore also provides UEFI interfaces. TianoCore doesn't have the specialized drivers that initialize functions, which are instead provided by coreboot, of which TianoCore is one of many payload options. The development of coreboot requires cooperation from CPU manufacturers to provide the specifications needed to develop initialization drivers.

In 2011, Microsoft announced that computers certified to run its Windows 8 operating system had to release with Microsoft's public key enrolled and Secure Boot enabled. Following the announcement, Microsoft was accused by critics and free software/open source advocates (including the Free Software Foundation) of trying to use the Secure Boot functionality of UEFI to prevent the installation of alternative operating systems such as Linux. Microsoft denied that the Secure Boot requirement was intended to serve as a form of lock-in. They also clarified its requirements by stating that 32-bit-based systems certified for Windows 8 must allow Secure Boot to enter custom mode or be disabled, but not on systems using the ARM architecture. Windows 10 allows OEMs to decide whether or not Secure Boot can be changed by users of their 32-bit systems.
Other developers concerned about the issues of implementing support for Secure Boot on Linux systems in general. Former Red Hat developer Matthew Garrett noted that conditions in the GNU General Public License version 3 may prevent the use of the GNU GRand Unified Bootloader without a distribution's developer disclosing the private key (however, the Free Software Foundation has since clarified its position, assuring that the responsibility to make keys available was held by the hardware manufacturer), and that it would also be difficult for advanced users to build custom kernels that could function with Secure Boot enabled without self-signing them. Other developers suggested that signed builds of Linux with another key could be provided, but noted that it would be difficult to persuade OEMs to ship their computers with the required key alongside the Microsoft key.
It has been disputed whether the operating system kernel and its modules must be signed as well; while the UEFI specifications do not require it, Microsoft has asserted that their contractual requirements do, and that it reserves the right to revoke any certificates used to sign code that can be used to compromise the security of the system. In Windows, only the WHQL kernel driver is allowed if Secure Boot is enabled. In February 2013, another Red Hat developer attempted to submit a patch to the Linux kernel that would allow it to parse Microsoft's authenticode signing using a master X.509 key embedded in PE files signed by Microsoft. However, the proposal was criticized by Linux creator Linus Torvalds, who attacked Red Hat for supporting Microsoft's control over the Secure Boot infrastructure.

Fustanella

Fustanella (; ) is a pleated, or folded, skirt like a Scottish kilt. It is worn by men from different countries in Southeast Europe.

The fustanella originates from ancient Greek clothing like the "chiton" (or tunic) and the "chitonium" (or short military tunic). An ancient Greek statue in Attica shows a stonecutter named Archedemus wearing a folded skirt like the fustanella. The ancient Roman toga may have also impacted the development of the fustanella.

In the Byzantine Empire, the fustanella was worn and called the "podea" (). It was commonly used in Greek lands as early as the 12th century AD. In Byzantine art and music, the wearer of the "podea" was either a hero or a Greek warrior defending the empire's borders. The fustanella was part of a military outfit consisting of bows, swords, battle-axes and armor (corselet or chain mail). In the Ottoman Empire, the fustanella was worn by Greek guerillas like the klephts and the armatoloi. In Albania, the fustanella is first mentioned in 1335 in a list of items taken from a sailor at the port of the Drin River. 

The Albanian fustanella is based on the Greek fustanella. But the difference is in the number of pleats. The "Bridegroom's coat" is a Greek fustanella with two-hundred pleats that a bride would buy as a wedding gift for her groom. The Albanian fustanella has around sixty pleats or usually a moderate amount of folds.





Buck Wild

Buckminster "Buck" Wild is a weasel that appeared in "". He is missing his right eye and wears a leaf as an impromptu eyepatch, as well as having a scar on one of his ears and seems slightly insane (he claims that he woke up one day, married to an ugly pineapple, but he still loved "her", and Manny calls him a "deranged hermit." He also claims to have sadly been "killed by Rudy," although he was not). According to the official website, Buck is one-eyed and relentless in his hunting for dinosaurs. Buck's archenemy is a large albino Baryonyx he calls Rudy, who gouged out Buck's eye and attempted to eat him, but failed after Buck grabbed onto to Rudy's uvula, swung on it, and then let go, knocking out Rudy's teeth, which he kept and later sharpened into a knife that he carries with him. Buck is the only inhabitant of the dinosaurs' world who does not fear Rudy in the slightest, though he possesses a deep respect for him. Due to living underground for so long, he has an extensive knowledge of the dangers of the dinosaur world.

Buck first met Manny, Crash, Eddie, Diego, and Ellie (who he at one point refers to as "preggers") after they descend into the jungle in pursuit of Sid and Momma, and saves them from a dinosaur attack. He has been living in the jungle for quite some time, persistently hunting Rudy to avenge the loss of his eye, and agrees to lead them to Lava Falls, where Momma has taken Sid, and rescues him after taking control of a Harpactognathus. After Rudy's potential death, Buck, having lost his purpose in life, decides to join the herd and live on the surface. Upon hearing a distant familiar roar that tells him that Rudy survived the fall, he chooses to stay and causes a cave-in that seals off the path between the surface and the underground jungle, trapping him inside and everyone else on the surface. He and Rudy proceed to continue their battle.

Buck and Rudy make brief cameos in "Scrat's Continental Crack-Up" and "" when Scrat falls through the Earth and passes them.

He returns to help the herd with an ancient stone pillar and rejoins them to stop the asteroid in "" while being pursued by a family of Dino-Birds.

Due to being voiced by Simon Pegg, Buck speaks with a British accent.

Open Market

The phrase "open market" describes an economic system like free trade. It can also mean banks trading assets.

Deaf-mute


Deaf-mute is a term which refers to deaf people who cannot speak a language. They cannot speak by mouth. Or, they may choose not to speak because of the attention unusual voices attract.

They communicate using sign language.

Today some prefer simply "deaf". However, it may be important for others to know whether a deaf person can speak, even imperfectly.

There is a complete range of intelligence in deaf-mutes. However, the limitations of their language ability may have an effect on their understanding of the external world. Many live communally amongst others who are expert in using their particular sign language. But sign languages differ greatly between countries, and may also differ inside a country.

Goitre and associated deaf-muteism was widespread in Switzerland until the 1920s, when iodised salt was introduced.

Charadrahyla nephila

The Oaxacan cloud forest tree frog ("Charadrahyla nephila") is a frog that lives in high places in the state of Oaxaca in Mexico. Scientists have seen it between 680 and 2256 meters above sea level. They think it might also live in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas.

The adult male frog is 52.9 to 61.9 mm long from nose to rear end] and the adult female frog is 59.6 to 80.7 mm long.

The adult male frogs and adult female frogs are different colors. The female frog is red-brown and the male frog is gray-brown to almost pink. The bars on the female frog's legs can be a little green, and the bars on the male frog's legs are brown. Female frogs have spots on their sides, and male frogs have light colored sides with green, brown, or black spots.

These frogs lay eggs in streams. The eggs stick to rocks or to wood. They lay 980 to over 2000 eggs at a time. The eggs are about 2 mm long.

This frog is in danger of dying out. This is because human beings change the forests where it lives, cutting down trees for lumber and to build towns.

The scientific name for this frog "nephilia" comes from the Greek language words "nephos" for clouds and "filia" for to love. Together, it means "the frog that loves clouds."

Priscus

Priscus of Panium () was a Roman diplomat and Greek historian from the 5th century AD.

Priscus was born between 410 and 420 AD in Panium (or Panion), Thrace. He joined in 448/449 AD the Roman embassy, led by Maximinus and speaking on behalf of Emperor Theodosius II, on a diplomatic mission to the court of Attila the Hun. While he was there, Priscus met and spoke with a Greek trader dressed in Hunnic clothes who was captured in around 441–442 AD when the Huns pillaged the city of Viminacium in modern Serbia. The trader then told Priscus that he was a slave of a Hunnic nobleman named Onegesius, but got his freedom and chose to live among the Huns. Priscus finally had a debate with the Greek defector about life and justice in both the Roman Empire and in barbarian kingdoms.

Priscus traveled to Rome, Alexandria, and Egypt. In around 456 AD, he was with the staff of Euphemios as the "magister officiorum" of Emperor Marcian. Priscus died after 472 AD.

Priscus wrote in the Greek language a history of the Byzantine Empire in eight books. The books probably covered the time from the rise of Attila the Hun to the rise of Emperor Zeno, or from 433 up until 474 AD. Priscus was very influential in the empire and his books were used by different writers: Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus ("Excerpta de Legationibus"), Evagrius Scholasticus, Cassiodorus, Jordanes, and author of the Suda. The style of Priscus's writing is direct and his work is considered a trustworthy account of Attila the Hun, his court, and the admission of the Roman ambassadors. Priscus relied on a style of historiography that was part of an ancient Greek tradition dating back to the 5th century BC.

The books of Priscus are published in four collections:

Skanderbeg

Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu (1405 – 17 January 1468), known as Skanderbeg ( from , "İskender Bey"; Latin:,) was an Albanian nobleman and military commander. He led a rebellion against the Ottoman Empire in what is today Albania, North Macedonia, Greece, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia.

Because he defended his principality (the Principality of Kastrioti) against Ottoman influences, he was given the Latin title "Athleta Christi" (meaning "warrior of Christianity") by Pope Callixtus III. Today, many people see him as an Albanian national hero. 

He was only able to hold his own possessions within the very small area in today's northern Albania. This is where almost all of his victories against the Ottomans took place. Skanderbeg's military skills were a major obstacle to Turkish expansion, and many in western Europe thought he was a model of Christian resistance against the Muslim Turks. For 25 years, from 1443 to 1468, Skanderbeg's 10,000-man army marched through Ottoman territory, winning against larger and better-supplied Ottoman forces. He was greatly admired for this.

The Albanians honor him and his 25 victories by including 25 wings on the Albanian black eagle.

He also produced "Garfield & Friends", a series which also aired on CBS from 1988 to 1994.

Davis was born in Marion, Indiana. He spent his time at a Black Angus cow farm in Fairmount, Indiana with his parents. His farm chores inspired the creation of Garfield's owner, Jon Arbuckle. Just like the author, Jon's birthday is on July 28. His education came from the Ball State University studying art and business.

In Fairmount High School, Davis took part of the newspaper known as "The Breeze". His first comics appeared here.

Today, most of his older comics are safely kept in a room. Davis uses a graphics tablet to draw his comics.

Before his job as a cartoonist, Davis worked for an advertising agency. In 1969, he worked with Tom Ryan's comic strip "Tumbleweeds". His first independent comic strip called "Gnorm Gnat" ran for two years in "The Pendleton Times". He believed that a cat should be the main character, and that cats were needed more than dogs.

The comic strip "Jon" was created, and was eventually renamed to "Garfield". The idea spread across 41 newspapers on June 19, 1978.

A lesser known comic Davis produced was "U.S. Acres". With Brett Koth, they made a strip inspired by the Mr. Potato Head toy.

The Professor Garfield Foundation was founded by Davis. It was to support the growth of children by reading.

In 2019, Davis gave permissions to ViacomCBS for a television show.

Evening glove

Evening gloves are long gloves for women's formal wear. These gloves are often worn with evening dress for debutante(ball gown) and wedding dresses. The longest of the evening gloves are called the "opera gloves". Opera gloves are very long gloves that go far beyond the elbow.

The appropriate length of the evening gloves is determined by the length of the sleeves of the dress. The shorter the sleeves of the dress, the longer the gloves should be. Evening gloves for formal(white tie) and semi-formal(black tie) wear come in three lengths for women: wrist, elbow, and opera. The opera reaches over the elbow, usually reaching to the biceps but sometimes to the full length of the arm. The "elbow-length or longer" part is the key; gloves which cover a substantial portion of the forearm, up to just below the elbow, can legitimately be called "long gloves" or "evening gloves", but never "Opera Gloves". In this case, the term "opera" is the same as "opera length necklace" or "opera length stockings" and refers to the length of the object rather than the type of party.

The most formal fabric for evening gloves is kidskin (young goats leather). The most expensive opera length gloves are custom-made of kidskin. Many other types of leather, most usually soft varieties of cowhide, are used in making full-length gloves; patent leather and suede are especially popular as alternatives to kidskin, and are often more affordable than kidskin. Satin and stretch satin materials are extremely popular, and there are mass-produced varieties as well. More unusual glove materials include leathers made from salmon, python, and stingray.

Charadrahyla esperancensis

The esperanza tree frog ("Charadrahyla esperancensis") is a frog that lives in Mexico. Scientists have seen it in Oaxaca at 1640 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is 44.3 to 48.9 mm long from nose to rear end.

This frog has smooth skin on its back and legs. It has bumpy skin on its belly. The top of the head and top of the back are either light brown or green-brown in color. The sides of the head has dark brown color from the nose to the eardrum. The sides of the frog's body are dark brown with yellow spots. The spots are not perfectly round. The tops of the legs are light brown with darker brown stripes going across. The legs have yellow spots. This frog has disks on its toes for climbing. The disks are darker in color than the rest of the toe. The belly is light in color.

"Esperanza" is "hope" in Spanish. Scientists named after the place where they saw the frog: La Esperanza in Sierra Juarez.

This frog is in some danger of dying out. This is because human beings change the places where it lives by cutting down trees to have wood or make towns and cities. This cuts the place where the frog lives into small pieces, where frogs in different places cannot go to each other. This makes them make young only with other frogs nearby, and they may be too closely realted to each other. These frogs also die from disease and climate change.

Human beings who live near La Esperanza have saved 4000 hectares of land to save this frog and other animals that live there.

United States of Europe

The United States of Europe (USE for short) is the idea that the countries of the European Union (EU for short) will unite into a single sovereign state. It would be similar to the United States of America (USA for short).

The USE would have much more influence (politically, economically, militarily, culturally, etc.) at the international level than an EU member country alone. It would be the world's third most populous country with a population of almost 450 million people. The economy of the USE would be the world's third-largest by GDP with almost 14 trillion euros.

Some critics believe that there will not be a USE in the near future because they think that:

-countries do not want to give up their national language for an official language of the USE

-countries do not want to give up their national identity

-countries with a small population do not want to end up as federal states with little voting weight

Paper marbling

Paper marbling is a method of which can make patterns. The patterns are the result of paint floated on water. The colouring is transferred to an absorbent surface, such as paper or fabric. 

It is often used as a writing surface for calligraphy, and especially book covers and endpapers in bookbinding and stationery.

It is rarely used today, but was common in the 19th century. The reason for its lack of use today may be that it adds to the expense of the finished book.

Johannes Diderik van der Waals

Johannes Diderik van der Waals (; 23 November 1837 – 8 March 1923) was a Dutch theoretical physicist and thermodynamicist. He became famous for his pioneering work on the equation of state for gases and liquids. Van der Waals started his career as a school teacher. In 1877, he became the first physics professor of the University of Amsterdam. Van der Waals won the 1910 Nobel Prize in physics for his work on the equation of state for gases and liquids.
His name is primarily associated with the Van der Waals equation of state that describes the behavior of gases and their condensation to the liquid phase. His name is also associated with Van der Waals forces (forces between stable molecules), with Van der Waals molecules (small molecular clusters bound by Van der Waals forces), and with Van der Waals radii (sizes of molecules). As James Clerk Maxwell said, "there can be no doubt that the name of Van der Waals will soon be among the foremost in molecular science."
In his 1873 thesis, Van der Waals noted that real gases were not ideal: He thought this was because there are intermolecular interactions. He introduced the first equation of state derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent molecules. Spearheaded by Ernst Mach and Wilhelm Ostwald, a strong philosophical current that denied the existence of molecules arose towards the end of the 19th century. The molecular existence was considered unproven and the molecular hypothesis unnecessary. At the time Van der Waals's thesis was written (1873), the molecular structure of fluids had not been accepted by most physicists, and liquid and vapor were often considered as chemically distinct. But Van der Waals's work affirmed the reality of molecules and allowed an assessment of their size and attractive strength. His new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state. By comparing his equation of state with experimental data, Van der Waals was able to obtain estimates for the actual size of molecules and the strength of their mutual attraction.
The effect of Van der Waals's work on molecular physics in the 20th century was direct and fundamental. By introducing parameters characterizing molecular size and attraction in constructing his equation of state, Van der Waals set the tone for modern molecular science. That molecular aspects such as size, shape, attraction, and multipolar interactions should form the basis for mathematical formulations of the thermodynamic and transport properties of fluids is presently considered an axiom. With the help of the Van der Waals's equation of state, the critical-point parameters of gases could be accurately predicted from thermodynamic measurements made at much higher temperatures. Nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and helium subsequently succumbed to liquefaction. Heike Kamerlingh Onnes was significantly influenced by the pioneering work of Van der Waals. In 1908, Onnes became the first to make liquid helium; this led directly to his 1911 discovery of superconductivity.

PS General Slocum

The PS General Slocum was a ship. It was a steam ship. One June 15, 1904, it caught fire in the East River in New York. More than 1000 people died.

The PS Slocum was built in 1891. It had a sidewheel system. It was a paddle boat. It was a passenger ship. The Solcum was built to take as many as 2500 passengers. It had 2500 life vests. In May 1904, a fire inspector looked at the ship and said its fire stopping tools were in "fine working order."

St. Mark's Evangelical Lutheran Church was on the Lower East Side of Manhattan island. It was in a German-American neighborhood called "Kleindeutschland", or "Little Germany." The church paid the Knickerbocker Steamboat Company $350 for the General Slocum to take a special trip. The trip was to celebrate the end of the school year. Not everyone who came on the trip was German-American. Churchgoers invited their friends and neighbors to come too. Most people wore their best clothes. The people on the boat planned to go to Locust Grove on Long Island's North Shore for the day. They brought baskets of food for picnics. There were 1,358 people on the boat in total, passengers and crew. Most of the passengers were women and children.

The ship left Manhattan at 9:00 a.m. Before 9:30, something on the ship began to burn. The ship caught fire. People had to decide whether to burn on the boat or jump into the water. Most people in 1904 New York could not swim. The clothes people wore in 1904 New York became very heavy when they got wet, so even people who could swim a little were pulled down into the river.

The crew tried to put out the fire with fire hoses. But the hoses were old and broke apart. There were life vests on the ship, but they were so old that they only sank into the water. They had been made with cork, but the cork had turned to powder. The life boats were old and could not float. The crew had not done any fire drills. The crew did not know what to do when the passengers became frightened.

The captain, William Henry Van Schaick, tried to find a place to land, and he chose North Brother Island a mile away. He made the ship move very fast. This made the fire worse.

Some people saw the fire and tried to help. Tug boats came to the ship. The people tried to pull people from the General Slocum out of the water. Mostly, they found dead bodies, but the people on the tug boats pulled dozens of living people out of the water. A ship from the New York Yacht Club came near the General Slocum, but the man on it only watched.

The ship came to North Brother Island. The island had a hospital on it for people with typhoid. The people in the hospital blew their fire whistle. They brought hoses and equipment to put out the fire. Nurses threw ropes and anything that would float to people in the water. Some nurses jumped into the water and swam to pull people out. But the fire was very hot and many people burned to death.

321 people lived. 1021 died. This was the highest number of dead people from one thing in New York City until the September 11 attacks in 2001. The river water washed dead bodies onto the ground for days.

People are not sure how the fire started, but it could have been from a match or cigarette falling onto some hay.

Frank A. Barnaby, the President of the Knickerbocker Steamboat Company, said the captain and crew had done well.

People said Captain Van Schaick decided not to steer the ship back to the city when the fire started. They said this was because of insurance. But it may not be true. Van Schaick steered the ship toward North Brother Island. Van Schaick said this was because he would have had to land the ship near 130th street near the Bronx, which had wood yards and gas tanks.

Captain Van Shaick was put on trial in a United States Circuit Court for criminal negligence. On Janaury 27, 1906, he was found guilty. They said the disaster was his fault because he did not make the crew do fire drills. Judge Thomas sentenced him to 10 years hard labor. The Knickerbocker Steamboat Company was not punished.

Van Schaick went to Sing Sing prison. His wife asked President William Howard Taft to pardon him. Taft did in 1911.

The German-American community in Manhattan changed after the disaster. Many people whose families had died killed themselves or were so sad that it became an illness. The Jewish-American and Italian-American communities lost many people too. There is a marble monument to the people who died in Tompkins Square Park. The Sympathy Society of German Ladies put it there in 1906.

Because most of the people on the boat were women and children, many German-American men suddenly had no wives or children. Many of them moved north to be nearer the place where their families had died. Soon, there was a German-American neighborhood on the Upper East Side. The Kleindeutschland neighborhood faded away. New people from Poland and Russia came to live there instead.

Navy bean

The navy bean, haricot, pearl haricot bean, Boston bean, white pea bean, or pea bean is a variety of the common bean ("Phaseolus vulgaris") native to the Americas, where it was first domesticated. It is a dry white bean that is smaller than many other types of white beans, and has an oval, slightly flattened shape. It features in such dishes as baked beans, various soups such as Senate bean soup, and even pies.

The green bean plants that produce navy beans may be either of the bush type or vining type, depending on which cultivar they are.

The name "Navy bean" is an American term coined because the US Navy has served the beans as a staple to its sailors since the mid-1800s.

In Australia, navy bean production began during World War II when it became necessary to find an economical way of supplying a nutritious food to the many troops—especially American troops—based in Queensland. The United States military maintained a large base in Kingaroy and had many bases and camps throughout south-east Queensland. It actively encouraged the widespread planting of the beans. Kingaroy is known as the Baked Bean Capital of Australia. Another popular name for the bean during this time was "the Yankee bean".

Navy bean cultivars include:


Other varieties of white beans include:


White beans are the most abundant plant-based source of phosphatidylserine (PS) yet known. It contains notably high levels of apigenin, , which vary widely among legumes.

Consumption of baked beans has been shown to lower total cholesterol levels and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This might be at least partly explained by the high saponin content of navy beans. Saponins also exhibit antibacterial and anti-fungal activity, and have been found to inhibit cancer cell growth. Furthermore, navy beans are the richest source of ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid among the common bean varieties.

Dried and canned beans stay fresh longer by storing them in a pantry or other cool, dark place under . With normal seed storage, seeds should last from one to four years for replanting, with a very large timetable for cooking for well-kept seeds, nearing on indefinite. Avoid beans that are discolored from the pure white color of these beans, as they may have been poorly handled while they dried.

Cingulate cortex

The cingulate cortex is a part of the brain in the middle of the cerebral cortex. The two parts of the cingulate cortex are the cingulate gyrus and the cingulate sulcus. The cingulate cortex is above the corpus callosum. 
The cingulate cortex is connected to many other parts of the brain. It gets input from the thalamus and the neocortex. Neurons send information from the cingulate cortex to the entorhinal cortex.
The cingulate cortex is a part of the limbic system. It is important for emotions, learning, and memory. The cingulate gyrus is very important for learning from the result of actions (eg. a child did an action that caused a bad outcome, so the child learned to not do that action). The cingulate cortex is also important in depression and schizophrenia.

Transformice

Transformice is a massively multiplayer online game that is available to play online. It is also a platform game and is free-to-play. It was created by Tigrounette and Melibellule on May 1, 2010. "Transformice" needs either a web browser running Adobe Flash Player 9.0+, Adobe AIR to use the official standalone or Steam to play the game. In 2012, the game had 10 million accounts, 60 million in 2015, 70 million in 2017, and 100 million in 2019.

The aim of the game is to collect the cheese as a mouse and take it back to the mouse hole. Players control the mouse with the arrow keys.

When a player gets the highest score on the scoreboard, they will become a shaman on the next map. The shaman helps other players get the cheese and bring it back to the hole. The shaman can make objects such as planks, boxes, anvils and balloons to create structures.

Cheese can be used to buy clothes for the mouse.

Players can win rewards such as titles, badges and clothes by completing tasks.

"Transformice" has different game modes.

This is the normal mode of "Transformice". It has maps mostly made by players.

Vanilla is very similar to "Transformice". It only has official maps.

In this mode, the shaman tries to kill the mice using cannonballs.

In this mode, players compete to finish maps as fast as possible. Shortcuts help finish the map quickly.

Bootcamp levels are very hard.

The map moves horizontally and players must keep up with it. There are points around the map and mice must collect as many as possible before getting the cheese and entering the hole.

This mode has minigames made by other players using a programming language called Lua. There are over 40 official modules and over 70 semi-official modules.

There is no objective in this game mode. The map looks like a village, with several non-player characters. Players use the village to chat, roleplay or trade.

The game was created by Melibellule (real name Mélanie Christin) and Tigrounette (real name Jean-Baptiste Le Marchand). They met at work and became friends. Tigrounette had experience making games in the past and wanted Melibellule to make the artwork. Melibellule came up with the idea of a little mouse who had to get cheese and bring it back to the mouse hole as quickly as possible.

After quitting their jobs, Melibellule and Tigrounette created the gaming company Atelier 801. They later made the games "Run for Cheese!", "Bouboum", "Nekodancer", "Fortoresse", "Dead Maze" and "Tomb Rumble". A sequel called "Transformice Adventures" is being made.

Domeykosaurus

Domeykosaurus (meaning "Domeyko lizard", after 19th century scientist Ignacy Domeyko) is a genus of dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous. It was a sauropod, more specifically a Titanosaur Its fossils were found in Chile by paleontologists David Rubilar and Alexander Vargas in 2003. At 40 percent complete, the Domeykosaurus fossil is the most complete example of any dinosaur found in Chile.

Domeykosaurus was 25 feet long and 6.5 feet wide, with the long neck and tail typical of titanosaurs. It was uncharacteristically gracile, with more slender limbs than are usually associated with its type. Paleontologists speculate that the herbivore most likely ate such plants as the extant genus Araucaria, also known as the "Monkey Puzzle Tree", which is native to the area.

Oxyrhynchus hymn

The Oxyrhynchus hymn is a Christian Greek religious song with lyrics and musical notation from the 3rd century AD. The hymn was written on a manuscript that was discovered in 1918 in modern Egypt, published in 1922, and now preserved in Oxford University.

The lyrics of the Oxyrhynchus hymn were written in the Greek language. They use poetry to summon silence in praise of the Holy Trinity, a motif of ancient Greek hymns called "cosmic stillness". The music of the Oxychynchus hymn is composed in Greek vocal notation. Overall, the Oxyrhynchus hymn illustrates the historical continuity of Greek culture where educated Christian Greeks accepted and used the musical notation of their ancient Greek ancestors.

Specials (Unicode block)

Specials is a short Unicode block of characters put at the very end of the Basic Multilingual Plane, at U+FFF0–FFFF. Of these 16 code points, five have been used since Unicode 3.0:

FFFE and FFFF are not unused in the usual way, but guaranteed not to be Unicode characters at all. They can be used to guess a text's scheme, since any text using these is not a correctly encoded Unicode text. Unicode's character can be put at the start of a Unicode text to signal its endianness: a program reading such a text and finding 0xFFFE would then know that it should switch the byte order for all the following characters.

Its block name in Unicode 1.0 was Special.

The replacement character (�) (often displayed as a black rhombus with a white question mark) is a symbol found in the Unicode standard at code point U+FFFD in the "Specials" table. It is used for problems when something is unable to render a stream of data to a correct symbol. It is usually seen when the data is not valid and does not match any character:

Consider a text file containing the German word (meaning 'for') in the ISO-8859-1 encoding (codice_1). This file is now opened with a text editor that thinks that the input is UTF-8. The first and last byte are valid UTF-8 encodings of ASCII, but the middle byte (codice_2) is not a valid byte in UTF-8. So, a text editor could replace this byte with the replacement character symbol to make a valid string of Unicode code points. The whole string now looks like this: "f�r".

A poorly made text editor might save the replacement character in UTF-8, and the text file data will then look like this: codice_3, which will be displayed in ISO-8859-1 as "fï¿½r" (this is called mojibake). Since the replacement is the same for all errors this makes it impossible to get the first character. A better (but harder to make) way is to keep the original bytes, including the error, and only convert to the replacement when "displaying" the text. This will allow the text editor to save the original byte sequence, while still showing the error to the user.

At one time the replacement character was used a lot when there was no glyph that can be used in a font for that character. However, most new text rendering systems instead use a font's character, which most times is an empty box (or "?" or "X" in a box), sometimes called a "tofu" (this browser displays 􏿾). There is no Unicode point for this symbol.

So, the replacement character is now only seen for encoding errors, such as invalid UTF-8. Some software tries to hide this by translating the bytes of invalid UTF-8 to matching characters in Windows-1252 (since that is the most likely source of these errors), so that the replacement character is never seen.

The following Unicode-related documents record the purpose and process of defining specific characters in the Specials block:

The Santa Barbara tree frog or Alvarenga's tree frog ("Bokermannohyla alvarengai") is a frog that lives in Brazil. It lives in the Serra do Espinhaço mountains.

With most frogs, the adult female is larger than the adult male. But with these frogs, the male frog is larger than the female frog. The male frogs also have larger, stronger front legs and larger spines. Scientists say that when male frogs are larger than female frogs, it is because the male frogs fight each other. Male Santa Barbara tree frogs sometimes have scars on their skin that could be from fighting each other.

Bokermannohyla saxicola

The ledge tree frog ("Bokermannohyla saxicola") is a frog that lives in Brazil. It lives in the Serra do Espinhaço and Serra de Cipó mountains, usually more than 800 meters above sea level.

This frog is 5.0 to 5.4 cm long from nose to rear end.

These frogs live in montane meadows, grassy places partway up mountains. It lays eggs in rocky streams. This frog only lives below 800 meters above sea level when the streams stay rocky that low. Scientists have seen it as close to sea level as 600 meters, always by rocky streams. The tadpoles take about five months to grow.

There are four different groups of ledge tree frogs, each living around the top of a different mountain.

Scientists looked at the frog's DNA. They saw it became its own species 6.1 million years ago, during the c. 6.1 million years ago Miocene era.

Voiced alveolar lateral fricative

The voiced alveolar lateral fricative is a type of consonant. Some spoken languages use it. The letter for this sound in the International Phonetic Alphabet is (sometimes called "lezh"). The X-SAMPA symbol for this sound is codice_1. The voiced alveolar lateral fricative is not used in English.

A pharyngealized voiced alveolar lateral fricative is reconstructed to be the ancient Classical Arabic pronunciation of the Arabic letter . (This means that linguists do not know how the letter was actually pronounced. However, by looking at modern languages, they think that this is how it was pronounced in the ancient language.) Today, the letter is pronounced in Modern Standard Arabic as a pharyngealized voiced coronal stop. This sound can be either alveolar or denti-alveolar .

In 1938, a letter shaped similarly to heng was approved as the official IPA letter for this sound. It replaced . However, the International Phonetic Association also suggested that a compromise between the two letters could be used if the author wanted. This compromise letter was included in the 1949 "Principles of the International Phonetic Association" and the IPA charts of that year. Although the International Phonetic Association said to use this letter, some authors still used from the 1960s to the 1980s. Later, this new letter was replaced by at the 1989 Kiel Convention.

Equation of state

In physics, chemistry and thermodynamics, equations of state are used to describe the state a dynamical system is in. . Equations of state are commonly used to describe the state of gases and fluids. In the real world, equations of state are approximations. They can be quite complex to write down, and usually, they are solved using numerical methods.
There are certain variables such as pressure, volume, or temperature, that can be used to describe such a system. So in its simplest form, an equation of state is a function, that takes these dependent variables as input, the state can then be as simple as saying that in its current state, the function has the numerical value zero:

formula_1

where p ist the pressure, V is the volume, and T is the temperature.
The simplest of these describes an ideal gas, it is the ideal gas law. This law can also be used to describe the state of real gases, in certain conditions (such as with a low pressure, and high temperature).

Nepali tea

Tea plants grown in Nepal, are used to make tea. This tea is called Nepali tea. These plants look, smell, and taste a bit different from other tea plants. They are similar to the tea plants grown in Darjeeling, which are used to make Darjeeling tea. This may be because the eastern parts of Nepal are geographically similar to the Darjeeling region. Darjeeling produces a lot more tea than Nepal. For this reason, tea from Nepal is not as well-known. 

There are two types of Nepali tea:


Like Darjeeling Tea, Orthodox Tea is made from the Chinese variety of tea plants. The tea is rolled by hand, or using a machine. Most speciality teas like green tea, oolong tea, white tea, and hand rolled tea fall under the category of orthodox tea. In Nepal, Orthodox Tea is produced and processed in the mountain regions, at altitudes between and . There are six major districts, primarily in the eastern regions of Nepal that are known for producing quality orthodox tea. They are Ilam, Panchthar, Dhankuta, Terhathum, Sindhulpalchok and Kaski.

With Nepali tea, the time of the year, when it is collected, is also recorded. There are four main times, called "flushes"

Crush, tear, curl (CTC) tea is a method of processing the Assam variety "(Camellia sinensis" var. "assamica)". It grows at a lower altitude, where the climate is hot and humid. Most of it is grown on the plains of the Jhapa district. Most tea drunk in Nepal is of this variety, almost 95%. Because it is easier to produce, it is also cheaper than orthodox tea. 

The Nepal CTC tea also has four pronounced flushes, the First, Second, Monsoon and Autumn flushes, but unlike the orthodox tea, the CTC tea is more or less uniform throughout, often showing a strong color and subtle aroma after infusion. However, the flushes do not begin and end in accordance with that of the orthodox tea, mainly because of differences in local conditions.

Weiss was born in Breslau, Silesia. His father, Johann Jacob Weiss, was a lute player. His brother, Johann Sigismund Weiss, was also a lute player. Weiss learned playing the lute from his father. 

In 1706, he worked for Charles III Philip, Elector Palatine. He wrote his first piece of music in Düsseldorf, which was a lute sonata in C major. In 1708, Prince Alexander Sobiesky invited Weiss to Italy. He stayed in Rome with the prince's family. He might have worked with Italian composers in Rome. He had to return to Germany when the prince died.

Weiss worked for Elector Charles Philipp again. In 1718, Weiss travelled to London. In London, he gave a concert every week. In August 1718, he became a member of the court chapel in Dresden. In 1718, Weiss visited Vienna. He played for the emperor. In 1722, he was attacked by a French violinist named Petit. Petit tried to bite Weiss' right thumb off. Weiss was not hurt badly. 

In 1723, Weiss went to Prague with Johann Joachim Quantz and Carl Heinrich Graun. They performed Johann Joseph Fux's opera, "Constanza e fortezza". In 1728, he went to Berlin. He stayed in Berlin for three months. He taught Frederick the Great's sister, Princess Wilhelmine. Weiss also taught other lutenists. One of his students was Adam Falckenhagen.

Weiss died on 16 October 1750 in Dresden. He was buried in the Catholic Cemetery in Dresden. Weiss was the highest-paid musician in Dresden. Even so, his family was poor when he died.

Weiss was one of the most important composers for the lute. He was one of the greatest players of the instrument. Even so, people forgot about Weiss' music after he died. This was because the lute was being replaced by keyboard instruments. Not everyone can read Weiss' music, because it was written in tablature notation.

A lot of Weiss' music is now lost. 

Johann Sebastian Bach knew Weiss' music. He arranged a lute sonata by Weiss for violin and harpsichord.

Kitana

Kitana is a fictional character in the "Mortal Kombat" electronic game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. 
Kitana appeared for the first time in the "Mortal Kombat II" (1993) game, where she is shown as a royal from Edenia, a fictional realm (kingdom). In the game, she uses a pair of fans made of steel, also named "tessenjutsu". Kitana uses these fans to make special attacks.

Commune of Llico

Llico was one of the communes that was part of the department of Vichuquén, in the province of Curicó.

The 1907 Chilean census established it had a population of 8.430 inhabitants.

The commune was created by decree of 22 December 1891, with the territory of Llico and Iloca subdelegations.

It was suppressed by the Decree with Force of Law No. 8.583, on 30 December 1927, by dictator Carlos Ibáñez del Campo as part of a greater political and administrative reform, adding its territory to the commune of Vichuquén. The commune was effectively suppressed on 1 February 1928.

Commune of Auquinco

Auquinco was one of the communes that was part of the department of Santa Cruz, in the province of Curicó.

The 1920 Chilean census established it had a population of 2.886 inhabitants.

The commune of Auquinco was created by Decree number 3.458 on 19 August 1918.

It was suppressed by the Decree with Force of Law No. 8.583, on 30 December 1927, by dictator Carlos Ibáñez del Campo as part of a greater political and administrative reform, adding its territory to the commune of Chépica. The commune was effectively suppressed on 1 February 1928.

Tomaso Albinoni

Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni (8 June 1671 – 17 January 1751) was a Venetian composer. He wrote operas and instrumental music. He is best remembered as the composer of a work called "Adagio in G Minor". Albinoni did not actually write the Adagio.

Albinoni was born in Venice. He learned to play the violin and to sing. It is not known who his teachers are. His first opera, "Zenobia, regina de Palmireni", was performed in Venice in 1694.

In 1705, he married Margherita Rimondi, a soprano singer. 

He became famous and he performed his operas in many Italian cities, including Venice, Genoa, Bologna, Mantua, Udine, Piacenza, and Naples. He also wrote and published instrumental music during this time. Albinoni did not try to find a job in a church or a court. He remained an independent composer and published music on his own.

He retired from writing music after 1741, and died in Venice in 1751.

Most of Albinoni's operas are lost. This is because he did not publish his operas during his life. His instrumental music has survived. Nine collections of instrumental music were published. Because of this, he is better known for writing instrumental music today. He is the first Italian composer to publish an oboe concerto.

He was known by Johann Sebastian Bach, who wrote at least two fugues based on themes by Albinoni.

Voiceless alveolar fricative

The voiceless alveolar fricative is a type of consonant. The letter for this sound in the International Phonetic Alphabet is ⟨⟩. The X-SAMPA symbol for this sound is ⟨s⟩. The English language has this sound, and it is the sound represented by 's' in "sun" and "sorry".


List of numbers

This is a list of numbers. This list will always be not finished. This happens because there are an infinite amount of numbers. Only numbers will be added. Numbers can be added as long as they are popular in math, history or culture.

This means that numbers can only be if they are a big part of history. A number isn't if it is only related to another number. For example, the number (3,4) is a number when it is a complex number (3+4i). When it is only (3,4), however, it's not notable.

Natural numbers are a type of integer. They can be used for counting. Natural numbers can also be used to find out about other number systems. A negative number is not a natural number.

0 is argued on whether or not it is a natural number. To fix this, people use the terms "non-negative integers", which cover 0 and "positive integers", which does not.

A prime number is a type of natural number. It only has two divisors: 1 and itself.

A highly composite number is a type of natural number. It has more divisors than any smaller natural number. They are used a lot in geometry, grouping, and time measurement.

The first 20 highly composite numbers are:

1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, 720, 840, 1260, 1680, 2520, 5040, 7560

A perfect number is a type of integer. It has the sum of its positive divisors (all divisors except itself).

The first 10 perfect numbers:

Integers are a set of numbers. They usually are in arithmetic and number theory. There are many subsets of integers. These can cover natural numbers, prime numbers, perfect numbers, etc.

Popular integers are −1 and 0.

Integers can be written in orders of magnitude. This can be written as 10, where "k" is an integer. If "k" = 0, 1, 2, 3, then the powers of ten for them are 1, 10, 100 and 1000. This is used in scientific notation.

Each number has its own prefix. Each prefix has its own symbol. For example, "kilo-" may be added to the beginning of "gram." This changes the meaning of "gram" to mean that the gram is 1000 times more than a gram: one kilogram is the same as 1000 grams.

A rational number is a number that can be written as a fraction with two integers. The numerator is written as formula_1. The denominator(which cannot be zero) is written as formula_2. Every integer is a rational number. This is because, in integers, 1 is always the denominator of a fraction.

Rational numbers can be written in infinitely many ways. For example, 0.12 can be written as "three twenty-fifths" (formula_3), "nine seventy-fifths" (formula_4), etc.

Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as a fraction. These are written as algebraic numbers or transcendental numbers.

The real numbers are a superset(or category) of numbers. They cover algebraic and transcendental numbers.

A hypercomplex number is a word for an element of a unital algebra over the field of real numbers.


Transfinite numbers are numbers that are "infinite". They are larger than any finite number. They are, however, not absolutely infinite.

Physical constants are constants that can be used in the universe to figure out information.

Sierra Entertainment

Sierra Entertainment was an American video game developer/publisher founded in the late 1970s by Ken and Roberta Williams.
The company is known for making the graphic adventure game genre, including the first game, Mystery House. It is also known for its adventure game series King's Quest, Space Quest, Police Quest, Gabriel Knight, Leisure Suit Larry, and Quest for Glory, as well as being the original publishers of Half-Life.
After 17 years as a lone company, Sierra was bought by CUC International in February 1996 to become part of CUC Software. However, CUC International was caught in an scandal in 1998. Therefore many of the original founders of Sierra including the Williamses left the company. Sierra remained as part of CUC Software as it was sold and renamed several times over the next few years; Sierra was dissolved as a company and reformed as a division of this group in 2004. The former CUC Software group was acquired by Vivendi and branded as Vivendi Games in 2006. The Sierra division continued to operate through Vivendi Games' merger with Activision to form Activision Blizzard in 2008. However, it was shut down later. The Sierra brand was revived by Activision in 2014 to re-release former Sierra games and some independently developed games.

Sierra Entertainment was founded in 1979 as On-Line Systems in Simi Valley, California, by Ken and Roberta Williams. Ken, a programmer for IBM, had planned to use the company to create business software for the TRS-80 and Apple II. Ken had brought a teletype terminal home one day in 1979, and while looking through the host system's catalog of programs, discovered the text adventure "Colossal Cave Adventure". He encouraged Roberta to join him in playing it, and she was thrilled by the game; after Ken had brought an Apple II to their home, she played through other text adventures such as those by Scott Adams and Softape to study them. Dissatisfied with the text-only format, she realized that the graphics display capability of the Apple II could improve the adventure gaming experience. With Ken's help in some of the programming, Roberta designed "Mystery House", inspired by the novel "And Then There Were None" and the board game "Clue", using text commands and printout combined with graphics depicting the current setting.

On-Line Systems leased their first office space from Ponderosa Printing, a modest space in the back of a small town print shop.

"Mystery House" was released in 1980. It was a great success with 15,000 copies sold, earning 167,000 American dollars (equivalent to 525,539 American dollars in 2020). It is the first computer adventure game to have graphics, although made with crude, static, monochrome line drawings. The two decided to shift the company's focus to developing more graphical adventure games. "Mystery House" became the first of their "Hi-Res Adventure" series. The "Hi-Res Adventure" series continued with "Mission Asteroid", which was released as "Hi-Res Adventure #0" though being the second release. The next release, "Wizard and the Princess", also known as "Adventure in Serenia", is considered a prelude to the later "King's Quest" series in both story and concept. Through 1981 and 1982, more games were released in the series including "Cranston Manor", "Ulysses and the Golden Fleece", "Time Zone", and "The Dark Crystal". A simplified version of "The Dark Crystal", intended for a younger audience, was written by Al Lowe and released as "Gelfling Adventure".

On-Line Systems was renamed Sierra On-Line in 1982, and they moved to Oakhurst, California. The "Sierra" name was taken from the Sierra Nevada mountain range that Oakhurst was near, and its new logo had the image of a mountain reflecting that. By early 1984 "InfoWorld" estimated that Sierra was the world's 12th-largest microcomputer-software company, with $12.5 million in 1983 sales.

The company weathered the video game crash of 1983 by seeing only a 20% increase in sales, after analysts in 1982 had predicted a doubling in 1983 of the entire software market. The company had spent much of 1983 developing for a Commodore machine and the TI-99/4A which were both obsolete by the end of the year. Ken Williams was reportedly described as "bewildered by the pace at which computers come into and fall out of favor", and Williams said, "I've learned my lesson. I'm not moving until I understand the market better."

Many of Sierra's most well known series began in the 1980s. In 1983, Sierra On-Line was contacted by IBM to create a game for the new PCjr. IBM offered to fund the entire development and marketing of the game, paying royalties. Ken and Roberta Williams accepted and started on the project. Roberta Williams created a story featuring classic fairy-tale elements. Her game concept includes animated color graphics, a pseudo 3D-perspective where the main character is visible on the screen, a more competent text parser that understands advanced commands from the player, and music playing in the background through the PCjr sound hardware. For the game, a complete development system called Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) was developed. In mid-1984, "King's Quest: Quest for the Crown" was released to much acclaim, beginning the "King's Quest" series.

Sierra On-Line expanded into a larger headquarters in the early-1980s.

While working to finish "The Black Cauldron", programmers Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy began to plan for an adventure game of their own. After a simple demonstration to Ken Williams, he allowed them to start working on the full game, which was named "Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter". The game was released in October 1986 as an instant success, spawning many sequels in the "Space Quest" series in the following years.

Al Lowe, who had been working at Sierra On-Line for many years, was asked by Ken Williams to write a modern version of Chuck Benton's "Softporn Adventure" from 1981, the only pure text adventure that the company had ever released. "Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards" was a great hit and won the Software Publishers Association's Best Adventure Game award of 1987. It can be deduced that the game first became famous as an early example of software piracy, as Sierra sold many more hintbooks than actual copies of the game. A series of "Leisure Suit Larry" games followed.

Ken Williams befriended a retired highway patrol officer named Jim Walls and asked him to produce an adventure series based on a police theme. Walls proceeded to create "Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel", which was released in 1987. Several sequels followed, and the series was touted for adherence to police protocol (relevant parts of which were explained in the games' manuals), and presenting some real-life situations encountered by Walls during his career as an officer.

"Quest for Glory" is a series of hybrid adventure/role-playing video games designed by Corey and Lori Ann Cole. The first game in the series, "Quest for Glory: So You Want to Be a Hero", was released in 1989. The series combines humor, puzzle elements, themes and characters borrowed from various legends, puns, and memorable characters, creating a five-part series of the Sierra stable. Although the series was originally titled "Hero's Quest", Sierra failed to trademark the name. Milton Bradley successfully trademarked an electronic version of their unrelated joint Games Workshop board game, "HeroQuest," which forced Sierra to change the series' title to "Quest for Glory". This decision caused all future games in the series (as well as newer releases of "Hero's Quest I") to switch over to the new name.

In 1987, Sierra On-Line started to publish its own gaming magazine, about its upcoming games and interviews with the developers. The magazine was initially named "The Sierra Newsletter", "The Sierra News Magazine", and "The Sierra/Dynamix Newsmagazine". However, since Sierra Club already published a magazine called "Sierra Magazine", the name of the magazine published by Sierra On-Line was changed to "InterAction" in 1991. It was discontinued in 1999.

Sierra's Adventure Game Interpreter engine, introduced with "King's Quest", was replaced in 1988 with Sierra's Creative Interpreter in "King's Quest IV". The game was released under both engines, so those who had newer computers could use the new engine and better rendering technology.



Sunkist (soft drink)

Sunkist (also marketed as Sunkist Soda) is a brand of mostly orange flavoured soft drinks that was created in 1979. Sunkist is a competitor of The Coca-Cola Company's Fanta brand and Keurig Dr Pepper's Orange Crush brand. 

Sunkist was first licensed by Sunkist Growers to the General Cinema Corporation, the main bottler of Pepsi-Cola products. The soft drink was the idea of Mark Stevens, who foresaw the potential based on market research which indicated that, worldwide, orange was the third-best-selling soft drink flavor (largely due to Fanta). 

Half-Life: Blue Shift

Half-Life: Blue Shift is an expansion pack for the game "Half-Life". It was made by Gearbox Software with Valve and published by Sierra Entertainment. "Blue Shift" was the second expansion for "Half-Life", originally intended as part of a port of "Half-Life". Although the port was cancelled, the Windows version was published as a standalone product in 2001 for Windows. It was published on Steam on August 24, 2005. The name is a pun on blue shift, a science term, and the fact that the player is on duty as a blue-wearing security guard.

As with Gearbox's previous expansion pack, "", "Blue Shift" returns to the events of "Half-Life", but portrays the story through the perspective of someone else. You play as security guard Barney Calhoun, hired by the Black Mesa Research Facility, who must fight his way to safety during an incident. "Blue Shift" also includes a pack that upgrades the "Half-Life" models and textures.

"Blue Shift" received both good and bad reviews. Many reviewers were critical of the short length and lack of new content, although the new graphics were praised.

Half-Life: Opposing Force

Half-Life: Opposing Force is an expansion pack for the game "Half-Life". The game was developed by Gearbox Software and Valve and published by Sierra Entertainment for Windows in 1999. "Opposing Force" was the first expansion for "Half-Life" and was announced in April 1999. Lead designer Randy Pitchford believed Gearbox was selected to develop "Opposing Force" because Valve, the creators of "Half-Life", wanted to focus on their future games. The name is a pun on the scientific term “opposing force”.

"Opposing Force" returns to the same setting as "Half-Life", but instead portrays the events from the perspective of a U.S. Marine, one of the enemy characters in the original game. The player character, Adrian Shephard, is sent in to neutralize the Black Mesa Research Facility when a incident causes it to be invaded by aliens, but quickly finds that the Marines are outnumbered by enemies. The game is notable for featuring an entirely new alien faction called Race X that is never seen anywhere else in the series, as well as new weapons and mechanics like commanding squads of marines and using night-vision instead of a flashlight.

Half-Life: Decay

Half-Life: Decay is a multiplayer expansion pack for "Half-Life". Created by Gearbox Software and published by Sierra, "Decay" was released as part of the PlayStation 2 version of "Half-Life" in 2001. It is the third expansion pack for "Half-Life", and like the other expansion packs, "Decay" returns to the setting and timeline of the original story and portrays the story from the perspective of a different set of protagonists: two female scientists working in the Black Mesa Research Facility. "Decay" is a cooperative multiplayer game, designed to be played by two people working together to pass through the game's levels.

Megaron

The megaron (, , plural "megara") is the rectangular great hall in Mycenaean and ancient Greek palace architecture. The hall was: 1) surrounded by four columns, 2) had an open portico with two columns in the front, and 3) had a central, open hearth venting through an oculus, or opening, in the roof. 

The megaron also had the throne-room of the "wanax", or Mycenaean Greek ruler, whose throne was in the main room with the central hearth. Similar architecture is found in the Near East but the open portico supported by columns is particular to the Aegean region. Megara are sometimes called "long-rooms" because of their rectangular shape and the position of their entrances. There were often many rooms around the central megaron, such as archive rooms, offices, oil-press rooms, workshops, potteries, shrines, corridors, armories, and rooms storing wine, oil and wheat.

The megaron was used for sacrifices, royal events, and court meetings.

Halls in the shape of rectangles were a defining theme of Greek architecture. The Mycenaean megaron originated from the "megaroid", or large hall-centered rectangular building, of Greece dating back to the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. Also, it was the architectural forerunner to ancient Greek temples. The megaron's structural layout included a columned entrance, a "pronaos", a central "naos" (or "cella"), and one of many roof types (i.e., pitched, flat, barrel). The roof was supported by wooden beams. The floor was made of patterned concrete and covered in carpet. The walls were built with bricks of mud, and were decorated with frescoes. There were metal doors often having two-leaved wood decorations. Footbaths were also used in the megaron as mentioned in Homer's "Odyssey" where Odysseus's feet were washed by Eurycleia. The dimensions involving a larger length than width are similar structurally to the early temples of the Dorian Greeks.

A famous megaron is in the king's large reception hall in the Bronze Age palace of Tiryns where the main room had a raised throne placed against the right wall and a central hearth bordered by four Minoan-style wooden columns supporting the roof. The Cretan elements in the megaron of Tiryns were adopted by the Mycenaean Greeks from Minoan palace architecture. Frescoes from Pylos show people eating and drinking, which were important activities in Greek culture. Artistic images of bulls, a common animal motif in Mycenaean vase painting, appear on Greek megaron frescoes such as the one in the Pylos megaron where a bull is shown at the center of a Mycenaean procession. Other famous megara include the ones at the Mycenaean palaces of Thebes and Mycenae. Different Greek cultures had their own megara where, for example, the Greeks of the mainland separated their central megaron from the other rooms whereas the Greeks of Crete did not do this.

Despite clashing with Aamir Khan's "Secret Superstar", "Golmaal Again" became one of the year's highest grossers and was a blockbuster at the box office. Its lifetime domestic net collection was more than 205 crores, while the worldwide gross ended at 311 crores. The film received mixed reviews from critics with praise for its humour and performances and criticism for its flaws in the technical aspects. In 2019, a show based on the Golmaal film series was made and it was called Golmaal Jr, which is a show about two rival prank gangs of kids, headed by Gopal and Madhav. A spin-off film titled "Cirkus" was released on 23 December 2022.

Gopal, Madhav, Lucky, Laxman and Laxman 2 are orphans in an orphanage in Ooty managed by businessman Jamnadas. Gopal is afraid of ghosts. Lucky is mute and Laxman has a speech impediment. The boys find a baby girl and take her in, naming her Khushi. They care for her and are also aware of librarian Anna's ability to see ghosts and spirits. One day, when Madhav pranks and scares the timid Gopal in an empty bungalow, a fight ensues between the boys. Gopal gets punished, which prompts Gopal and Laxman to leave the orphanage, and soon, Madhav, Lucky and Laxman also do the same. Khushi is later adopted by the loving Colonel Chauhan and his wife.
Some years later, Gopal and Laxman work with Babli Bhai and Madhav, Lucky and Laxman work with Vasooli Bhai. The group reunites after learning about Jamnadas' demise. Returning to the orphanage after 25 years, they meet Col. Chauhan, Anna and Pappi, another orphan from the orphanage who has frequent memory loss. They meet a girl who they think is the bungalow's caretaker, Damini and learn about Khushi's demise. At an event after Jamnadas' funeral, businessman Vasu Reddy reveals the orphanage would be demolished and moved elsewhere in plans to make his own building. When the group leaves the orphanage and returns, a ghost possesses Laxman and speak in Nana Patekar's voice which scares Gopal. Next, the ghost possesses Madhav and prompts Vasooli to give them a task, indirectly bringing the three back to Ooty. A scared Gopal calls Anna, who reveals that there is a spirit in their house and suggests him and Laxman to move to Col. Chauhan's house. Upon reaching Ooty, the two groups start fighting each other out of anger. The three try to scare Gopal into leaving the house, but Gopal gets possessed and beats Lucky and Laxman badly. Later, Vasu Reddy assigns Madhav, Lucky and Laxman to burn down the house. But things go awry when Lucky gets possessed by the spirit and starts talking, which scares the group. The two groups then decide to leave, but Anna and Damini convince them to stay for the birthday celebration, and the group makes amends. The four find that Gopal has fallen in love with Damini and force him to confess his feelings. Pappi arrives and reveals that the girl they assumed to be Damini is actually Khushi, who is dead, while the real Damini is Pappi's girlfriend. The boys get terrified and try to escape the house along with Pappi, Babli Bhai and Vasooli Bhai after Damini confesses it herself. Anna arrives and stops them and explains to them that the ghost is none other than their childhood friend Khushi.
A flashback narrated by Khushi explains how her boyfriend, Nikhil Surana, a young businessman and Jamnadas' nephew, killed him in order to obtain the orphanage in his name and demolish it for the construction of a site. Upon confronting him and threatening to go to the police, Khushi was strangled to death by Nikhil. With the help of Vasu Reddy, he managed to prove the killings to be accidents. However, Khushi's spirit came for help to Anna, who was surprised that the boys could see Khushi and eventually brought them to the house to help get justice for Khushi.
Back to the present, Gopal thrashes the goons sent by Vasu Reddy while the rest of the boys, who wanted to stay away from the matter, get emotionally convinced to stay. They convince Gopal to stop chasing the goons and later almost manage to scare Vasu into confessing the truth, but Nikhil arrives before they can and reveals there's no evidence to prove him guilty. This leads to a fight, during which Khushi attacks and nearly kills Nikhil but is calmed down by Anna, and Vasu convinces Nikhil to confess. With the orphanage saved, Khushi's spirit departs to heaven after bidding goodbye to the boys and Anna.

Grotte Mandrin

The Grotte Mandrin is a cave near Montélimar. It is near the small French town Malaverne, in the Drôme department. It is more like a shelter, that protects from the weather, and not really a cave. It is an archeological site: There are many well-preserved finds from the transition from the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic. The oldest layer of finds is 120,000 years old.

It is named after the French folk hero Louis Mandrin. 

The Abri is about southeast of Malataverne town center. It is at the foot of an exposed limestone cliff at 245 m height. At the site, the valley is very narrow, only about . Important traffic routes pass through there: the A7, N7, D169 and the high-speed line LGV Méditerranée .

Today, the Grotte Mandrin has a depth of . At some point part of it collapsed. Today, large boulders on the slope below are still there. The covered area was originally much larger. There is an opening of about facing north. At the front, the cave has a height of about . From the middle of the cave, it gets lower. At the back, the height is about less. 

In 2013, a fence was built on the space in front of the case. In 2016, video surveillance was installed.

When he found traces Bronze Age settlements there in 1960, Gaston Etienne (1923-2010) recognized that the case was important for archaeology. Etienne was a councillor in Malaverne. Since 1993, there have been excavations each year. Since 2006, Ludovic Slimak - a research associate from the University of Toulouse and the CNRS is overseeing these excavations. There are twelve cultural layers at the site, In 2014, seven layers had been excavated. The layers date from 42.000 BP (called early Aurigacien) to 56,000 BP (La Quina-Mousterian).

The oldest known evidence of anatomically-modern humans (homo sapiens) in Europe was found in the Batcho Kiro Cave in Bulgaria. This evidence is 45,820 to 43,650 years (Cal BP) old. In February 2022, it was announced that part of a tooth was found at the Mandrin Cave. It came from a layer of the Mandrin Cave under and over which Neanderthal remains have been recovered, but this "baby tooth" has been attributed to a child of Homo sapiens. Articles in the Journals Science, as well as in Nature, said that the tooth was too badly damaged to be able to tell with certainty if it was from a Neanderthal, or a human. 


Superabundant number

A superabundant number is a type of natural number. They were defined by Leonidas Alaoglu and Paul Erdős in 1944. 
Any natural number "n" is called superabundant when a certain equation is true.

In this equation, "m" is every integer less than "n". "σ" is the sum of every positive divisor of that number.

An example would be to use the number 9. For every number less than 8, the sigma is 1, 3, 4, 7, 6, 10, 8 and 16. ("σ"("m"))/"m" is 16/9. ("σ"(n))/n is equal to 13/9. 13/9 is less than 16/9. This makes 9 not a superabundant number

The first few superabundant numbers are 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, ... .

Leonidas Alaoglu and Paul Erdős proved that if "n" is superabundant, then there is a "k" and "a", "a", ..., "a" such that

where "p" is the "i"-th prime number, and

Basically, they proved that if a number is superabundant, the exponent of a larger prime number is never bigger than a smaller prime number during prime decomposition(the process of a composite number become smaller prime numbers). All primes from 0 to formula_4 are also factors of "n". The equation says that a superabundant number has to be an even integer. It also is a multiple of the "k"-th primorial formula_5

Superabundant numbers are like highly composite numbers. Not all superabundant numbers are highly composite numbers, though.

Alaoglu and Erdős observed that all superabundant numbers are also highly abundant. 



Eyeliner

An eyeliner (sometimes written eye liner) is a type of makeup used for the eyes. It is applied around the contours of the eyes to create different aesthetic effects.

In the 20th and 21st century, the use of eye liner has also been associated with Goth and Punk fashion.

Eye liner was first used in Ancient India, Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia as a dark black line around the eyes. As early as 10,000 BC, Egyptians and Mesopotamians wore various cosmetics including eye liner not only for aesthetics but to protect the skin from the desert sun. Eye liner may also have been worn to protect the wearer from the evil eye. The characteristic of having heavily lined eyes has been frequently shown in ancient Egyptian art. They produced eye liner with a variety of materials, including copper ore and antimony. Ancient Egyptian kohl contained galena, which was imported from nearby regions in the Land of Punt, Coptos and Western Asia.

In the 1960s, liquid eye liner was used to create thick black and white lines around the eyes in the make-up fashion associated with designers like Mary Quant. The '60s and '70s also saw new fashion trends which made use of eyeliner, eyeshadow and mascara in new ways. As goth and punk fashion developed, they employed eyeliner for a dark and dramatic effect.

Voiceless alveolar trill

The voiceless alveolar trill differs from the voiced alveolar trill in its phonation (whether or not the vocal chords are vibrating while pronouncing the sound). It is used in a few languages. In languages that also have the voiced alveolar trill, it can be a similar sound or an allophone (another way a certain sound can be pronounced).

In Proto-Indo-European, the sound *sr became a sound spelled , with the letter for and the diacritic for , in Ancient Greek. This sound was probably a voiceless alveolar trill. It became the regular word-initial (meaning "at the start of a word") allophone of in standard Attic Greek. This sound has disappeared in Modern Greek.

Features of the voiceless alveolar trill:
The voiceless alveolar fricative trill is not known to be a sound in any language, except maybe the East Sakhalin dialect of Nivkh. However, it is an allophone (another way of pronouncing a specific sound) in Czech.

Features of the voiceless alveolar fricative trill:



Voiceless alveolar plosive

The voiceless alveolar stop is a type of consonant. The letter for this sound in the International Phonetic Alphabet is ⟨⟩. The X-SAMPA symbol for this sound is . The English language has this sound, and it is the sound represented by "t" in "tear" and "tool".

Financial modelling

The financial model for a start-up is an exercise in creativity and forward-thinking. It’s an opportunity for entrepreneurs to let their imagination run wild, finally voicing their visions on paper. As startups are generally risky investments, the financial model is a tool that helps investors evaluate the venture before committing funds. The main purpose of the startup financial model is to show investors that your company can reach profitability within a reasonable time frame and make them enough money to justify their investment.

Financial modeling is an integral part of the startup world. You can use models to predict future growth, understand the impact of certain decisions, and help raise funding. It's also a great tool to see how sensitive your business is to certain assumptions. You can change certain inputs to see how they affect your bottom line or different stages in your model. Models are also good tools for learning about new industries and understanding valuations (if you're looking at acquiring another business).

Financial models are mathematical representations of a financial situation. They can range from simple to complex, depending on the purpose and users of the model. Different model types are appropriate for different purposes, such as long-term strategic planning or annual budgeting.

A company may use several different types of models at the same time. For example, a company may have a long-term strategic plan that it uses to inform its capital investment decisions, but it will also create an annual budget model to plan out how much cash it expects to spend and earn over the course of the year.


Financial modelling for startups is the creation of a financial representation of a startup business. It's used to forecast future cash flows and profitability.

Financial modelling is often used to assess a company's current financial health, its valuation and its potential for future growth. Financial modeling for startups is often used to prepare a document known as a pitch deck. This document is presented to investors and contains information such as: the company's business model, its target market, how it will make money, founders' backgrounds and its revenue projections.

A financial model is not complete without a full set of business assumptions that make up the model. These assumptions are typically broken down by revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), operating expenses, depreciation and amortization (D&A) and capital expenditures (CAPEX). The process of building a startup financial model is usually referred to as financial modeling.

National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics

The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) was a United States federal agency. It was founded on March 3, 1915. The agency researched flight technology and aircraft. On October 1, 1958, the agency was dissolved. Its employees were moved to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

NACA was founded on March 3, 1915. At that time, technology and culture were changing quickly. American flight technology was not as advanced as Europe's. The American public had mixed feelings about flight technology. Some people thought that flying was dangerous and foolish. Some thought that it was an important achievement in technology. But in Europe, people were more confident in flight technology. 

When World War I started in Europe, the Europeans were already using advanced flight technology. The Germans used airships to bomb British cities. Airplanes were used to spy on enemies. This worried the Americans, who realized that their flight technology is behind Europe's. In response, the federal government of the United States created NACA on March 3, 1915.

By the 1920s, the NACA's mission was to promote military and civilian flight. The NACA did this by researching new flight technologies. To help this research, the NACA built many testing facilities. This included wind tunnels, test stands, and flight test facilities. The agency received a budget of $5000 in 1915. 

The NACA was involved in World War II. They helped research many flight technologies. A lot of the research that the NACA did before World War II was used to make American fighter planes fly better. They researched how to reduce drag. Drag slows down airplanes when moving in the air. They also researched how to stop the propellers of the plane from freezing. 

On November 21, 1957, Hugh Dryden, NACA's director, established the Special Committee on Space Technology. This committee was created to help develop a space program.

Triprion petasatus

The Yucatán shovel-headed tree frog, Yucatan casque-headed tree frog, or Yucatan casquehead tree frog ("Triprion petasatus") is a frog that lives in Mexico and Guatemala. Scientists also saw it just once in Honduras.

This frog's Latin "petasatus" means "with a hat on." The Latin and English names come from the frog's big head, which looks like a hat or helmet.

The adult male frog is 48.1 to 60.8 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 65.0 to 75.2 mm long. It is named after its large, bony head, which looks like a hat or helmet. The adult male frog is olive green. The adult female frog is light brown or green-brown. There are dark brown or black marks on the back and legs. Some frogs have silver marks on their backs and head. The frogs have yellow color on their sides or red brown on their back legs. The belly is white and tan.

This frog lays eggs when the weather is rainy. The male frog climbs to a branch about 2.5 meters over the ground and sings for the female. The male and female mate in trees or other high places. The female lays eggs in shallow water. When the weather is dry or the sun is hot, this frog goes to a hole in a tree. It puts its body inside and its head against the hole.

This frog is not in danger of dying out. This is because human beings change the places where the frog lives. Human beings cut down the forests for wood, farms, towns, and places for animals to eat grass.

Human beings catch and breed this frog to sell as pets.

Highly abundant number

Highly abundant numbers are a type of natural number. Any natural number "n" is called highly abundant when a certain equation is true.

formula_1

In this equation, "m" is every integer less than "n". "σ" is the sum of every positive divisor of that number.
An example would be to use the number 5. "σ" of 5 is 5 + 1 = 6. Every "σ" less than 5, however, is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. 7 is greater than 6. This makes 5 not a highly abundant number.
Highly abundant numbers were first learned about by Subbayya Sivasankaranarayana Pillai in 1943. Work on the subject was done by Paul Erdős and Leonidas Alaoglu in 1944. Alaoglu and Erdős discovered every highly abundant number up to 10. They also showed that the number of highly abundant numbers less than "N" is proportional to log "N".

The first few highly abundant numbers are

There are only two odd highly abundant numbers. They are 1 and 3.

The first eight factorials are highly abundant. However, not all factorials are highly abundant. For example,

but there is a smaller number with larger sum of divisors,

This makes 9! is not highly abundant.

Alaoglu and Erdős discovered that all superabundant numbers are also highly abundant. There are, however, an infinite number of highly abundant numbers that are not superabundant numbers. This was proven by Jean-Louis Nicolas in 1969.

7200 is the largest powerful number that is also highly abundant. This is because every highly abundant number that is larger has a prime factor that divides them only once.

Palembangese noble titles are highly influenced by the Javanese nobility system due to the Javanese royals relationship with the Palembangese royals.








Teuku Iskandar

Teuku Iskandar was an Indonesian scholar, literary critic, lexicographer, historian, and nobleman. He was one of the native Indonesians of Acehnese who wanted to find explore the historical records of the indigenous civilizations of the Indonesian island of Sumatra (mainly revolve about the literatures of Acehnese, as well as Malay). In the modern days, Teuku Iskandar considered as the linguistic father of Standard Malay, a standardized form of Malay which heavily based on the Standard Indonesian linguistic elements.

Teuku Iskandar was born at the district of Trienggadeng in the Pidie Jaya regencial territory of Aceh (part of modern-day Indonesia). He was a native Acehnese who was born to a father who were an Aceh's "uleebalang" ( in Acehnese). His front name "Teuku" indicated that he was originally from notable Acehnese family background.

In 1947, a day after Queen Juliana appointed as regent, the 18-year-old Teuku Iskandar was able to continue his study at Leiden University in Leiden (part of the Netherlands).

In 1955, he earned his doctorate from Leiden University with a dissertation which was later published as a book, "De Hikajat Atjeh" (). Topics related to Aceh has become his personal interest due to his personal ancestry background, which later also became his main topic of his dissertation. His interest was mainly driven by his personal background because at that time he was part of the first-known generation of Acehnese who studied at the Leiden University in Netherlands. Moreover, at that time he was motivated by the fact that there were not as many books written by native Indonesians that discuss about the state of Aceh and its natives (the Acehnese people and Acehnese language). In addition, Teuku Iskandar adore the Acehnese culture so much, as he told to his children.

In the 1960s, Teuku Iskandar asked by Sukarno (the first president of Indonesia) to be part of the founders of a state university in the state of Aceh, which later publicly known as the Syiah Kuala University, which he was briefly served as the dean for the Faculty of Economics for several years.

His diligence in studying the Malay literature as one of the indigenous languages of Sumatra (and also the native culture of Sumatra in general) attracted another countries interest, such as the federation of Malaysia who had no capable linguists or even scholars at that time (as Malaysia was developed as newly created country), he was offered to work at the "Dewan Pustaka dan Bahasa" () of Malaysia. During his tenure, Teuku Iskandar asked by the Malaysia's linguistic council to copied the "Bahasa Indonesia dan Pembakuannya" () and "Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia" () who were developed by Raja Ali Haji (an Indonesian Bugis scholar) since 19th century and Anton Moeliono in 1969 to re-branded and claimed it as the "Kamus Dewan" () that published in 1970 and designated as the main linguistic reference for the Malay language in the region (which later also known as Malaysian Malay). At the same time, he was also asked by the Sultan of Brunei Darussalam to become a lecture at the University of Brunei Darussalam and he received a professorship from the university. His works are still used as the main linguistic source for the Standard Malay until nowadays in all respective Malay-speaking countries (which may include Singapore).

Teuku Iskandar later returned to Leiden to serve as the lecturer. Within his alma-mater (Leiden University) educational environment, he became a prominent and ultimate professor for Acehnese and Malay literature, and also gave special classes in the Acehnese language. As an Acehnese enthusiast, he also continued to produce his works related to Aceh including "the Catalog of Acehnese Manuscripts" (compiled with Voorhoeve), two large volumes of "the Catalog of Malay, Minangkabau and South Sumatra, and Manuscripts" (in the Netherlands).

Studying classical literary manuscripts is a job that not many people can do. It takes passion, perseverance, thoroughness and high concentration. But, indeed, such qualities seem to be attached to Teuku Iskandar. "Dad really likes history and art", said Tjut Njak Ubit Iskandar who are the second daughter of Teuku Iskandar. Teuku Iskandar is very thorough even in reading the books he referenced.

As a close daughter, Tjut Njak Ubit Iskandar often found his father's handwritten notes in reference books, which indicated that the information in the books could be referenced or questioned. Ubit also said that his father is the type of person who reads and contemplates a lot. Despite his abundant knowledge, he is not an 'outsider' or talkative person. Not all of his interlocutors can also make him interested in talking. But if he meets someone he thinks is sharp-minded, this father of three will be an extraordinary storyteller. “When there is a moment like that, my mother usually asks me to bring a recording device to save the interesting conversation,” recalls Ubit.

Teuku Iskandar was also a scholar and person who holds principles. He's not the kind of person who wants to please others but rather be himself. In Ubit's eyes, his father was not interested in politics even though he loved Sumatran (especially Acehnese and Malay) culture very much, he was an intellectual who carried himself as a citizen of the world. Also, not many people know that Teuku Iskandar is very fond of architectural history. According to Ubit, it can be said that his father's first love was precisely in architecture. However, because his chemistry skills were not sufficient to become a scholar of architecture, he then chose to study literature.

Teuku Iskandar's passion for architecture can be found in his residence in Jakarta which he designed himself. He also built a rest house with an English garden-style garden in Bogor, which he also designed his own architecture. At his home in the Netherlands, Teuku Iskandar designed a fireplace made of wood from a bridge from the 17th century with Acehnese decorations. One of his other hobbies is sketching. Teuku also once conveyed his dream to his sons and daughters, he wanted to build a farmhouse in Aceh. "I have a dream (to develop) in Aceh", Ubit remembers his father.

In one of his works, a book that discusses "Bustanas-Salatin" by Nuruddin ar-Ranniry, Teuku Iskandar asked Ubit to translate it into English. For years, the father and daughter studied books by 17th century clerics who were read by scholars and sultans in the Aceh Kingdom. For Ubit, it was a wonderful experience that was unforgettable.

As a respected scholar (mainly in Indonesia and Southeast Asia), Teuku Iskandar was known as a very down-to-earth person. Tjut Rosmanida, his first daughter who lived in Medan, said, “Father is a humble and simple person. His demeanor is mediocre. When you go home to Aceh, you always ask for Acehnese food to be cooked. He likes all Acehnese dishes.” A valuable lesson from his father that he always reminded him to be proud to be an Acehnese and proud to speak the Acehnese language.

Teuku Iskandar was officially awarded in 2017 as the ‘"Satyalancana Budaya"’, an award by the national government of the Republic Indonesia due to his revolutionary and persistent works, especially in revivifying the indigenous Sumatran linguistics and cultures (mainly revolve about Acehnese, as well as Malay).

Almost perfect number

In math, an almost perfect number (also called slightly defective or least deficient number) is a type of natural number "n". The sum of "n"'s divisors must be equal to 2"n" − 1. Every known almost perfect number is a power of 2 and has non-negative exponents .
For example, the divisors of 32 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32. The sum of those is 63. 32 ⋅ 2 - 1 is 63. This makes 32 an almost perfect number.
The only known odd almost perfect number 1. An odd almost perfect number that's not 1 is possible. It would, however, have to have six prime factors.

Triprion spinosus

The spiny-headed tree frog, spine-headed tree frog, crowned hyla, coronated tree frog, or spinyhead tree frog ("Triprion spinosus") is a frog that lives in Mexico, Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala. Scientists have seen it between 800 and 2,068 m meters above sea level in Mexico, 95 meters above sea level in Honduras, and 350 and 1330 meters above sea level in Costa Rica and Panama.

This frog used to be the only species in the genus "Anotheca", but then scientists moved it to "Triprion".

The adult male frog is 68 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 80 mm long. It has large, bony head with spines on it. In adult frogs, the skin has partially grown into the bone. Younger frogs do not have this. These frogs are dark brown in color, black bellies, and white sides. Male frogs do not have vocal slits in their throats, but they can sing anyway.

The female frog lays her eggs in holes in trees. First the male frog sits in the hole and sings. Then the female frog comes to him.

The female feeds the tadpoles by laying unfertilized eggs in the water inside the tree hole. Scientists have also seen the same female lay a second clutch of fertilized eggs in the same hole as her first clutch. Then the younger tadpoles disappear. The scientists believe that the older tadpoles eat them.

The tadpoles are white when they first hatch. Later they turn dark brown and blue-gray.

This frog is nearly in danger of dying out but there are fewer of them than there were. This is because human beings change the places where the frog lives. Human beings cut down the forests for wood, farms, towns, and places for animals to eat grass.

Kao (bull)

Kao (/káo/) is a legendary bull captured by Khuman Khamba in Meitei mythology and folklore of Ancient Moirang. It appears in the legend of "Kao Phaba" (), also known as "Khambana Kao Phaba" () of the Khamba Thoibi epic.
In Meitei (Manipuri), the word "Kao" has many meanings. It may mean (1) to forget, (2) a sacrifice bull or (3) to kick. Here, it means bull. As a noun, it means a stray bull that roams freely instead of living on a ranch or farm. In verbal form, it means to offer a bull as a living sacrifice to God. People also say "Kaoren" or "Kaorel" to talk about the bull. "Kaoren" is made up of two parts, "Kao" and "-ren". "-ren" refers to excellence. So, "Kaoren" or "Kaorel" means "an extraordinary bull", "a powerful bull", "a super bull" or "a supernatural bull".

Once Angom Nongban Kongyamba met fisher women from the Khuman kingdom in a place called Moirang. Both the Khuman kingdom and the Moirang kingdom were on the shores of the Loktak lake.
The women came to Moirang besides having their own fishing area. So, Kongyamba asked them the reason for coming to Moirang. 
The women said that a dangerous bull had killed many people near the water, so they could not fish:
<poem>"There is a great bull that lurks among the reeds of the shores of the lake, and it had claimed life of many. So, we dare not to fish there."</poem> 
Suddenly, an idea came to Kongyamba's mind. He went to the king. He acted as a person possessed by a divine spirit. Kongyamba told the King,
<poem>"God Thangjing had spoken in my ears and I have his behest upon me. Verily said the God, I am sated with offerings of flesh and fish, but this year, my heart longs for the sweet savour of the flesh of the mighty bull that lurks in the reeds that border the water of the lake. My servant Khamba vows that he will bring it for my honor and for the welfare of the State."</poem>
The king called and asked Khamba about his promise. Khamba denied it. There resulted a great conflict between Khamba and Kongyamba. Later, Khamba told the king he would catch the bull if it was the God’s will. 
The king was happy with Khamba. So, he promised him he could marry Princess Thoibi if he did catch the bull. Minister Thonglen put seven marks on the lintel post of the capital city. It was the record of the King's promise.

The king of Moirang sent an embassy to the king of Khuman. The embassy proposed to organize the great sport of capturing the wild bull. The Khuman king agreed. A grand Colosseum was built for the event. The Colosseum could hold a capacity of the audiences from both the two kingdoms.

Khamnu revealed a secret to Khamba. She said that the bull had once belonged to their father. She told him that if Khamba told the bull their father's name, it would be tame and gentle:
<poem>"This great bull was once the Lord of your father's herd. Go to him, speak your father's name in his ear, and show him this Rope of silk."</poem>
On the day of the adventure, Khamba stood face to face with the bull. The bull ran towards him with its dangerous horns. Khamba bent a little to the side. The people watching asked him if he was afraid. Khamba answered that he was waiting for a good position. Then, he stood on firm ground and caught the bull. The strong bull carried him away into the thick woods.
Khamba did everything as his sister had told him to do. Immediately, the wild bull became tame and gentle. Khamba brought the bull back.
On the way back, Kongyamba came to him before anyone saw them. Kongyamba pretended to help Khamba to hold the bull. Kongyamba held the rope. When everyone saw, Kongyamba claimed that he had captured the bull. He added that he even rescued Khamba who had fallen into the ditch. Once again, there was a great conflict between Khamba and Kongyamba over the claim. The two kings could not find out who was right. So, Kongyamba was asked to fight the bull within an enclosure. But Kongyamba was afraid of the bull. He climbed up on the heights to save himself. Khamba faced the bull bravely. He once again captured the bull.

In popular culture, Kao appears in arts, books, movies, theatres and many others.
In 2001, Khambana Kao Phaba (painting) was kept in the permanent collection of the Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sangrahalaya (IGRMS) Museum, Bhopal, India.
In July 2019, the painting was selected as the "Exhibit of the Month" in the same museum.

In 2011, ""Kao, the sacred bull"" was produced by the Laihui Ensemble. This theatrical show was based on the story of the bull Kao. According to the story, an Oracle said that the King of Moirang will soon die and his people will lead miserable life. The only solution told was to offer the powerful bull roaming in the Khuman kingdom to God Thangjing. Orphan Khuman Khamba was chosen to capture the bull. He was known for his bravery and goodness. To capture the bull with no harm to it was not easy. Khamba's motherly sister Khamnu disclosed to him the secrecy of the bull. The bull was once domesticated and treated as a family member during the good days of their parents.
In 2020, a named ""Kao Faba"" was produced by Western Cultural Association in Manipur. It was sponsored by the Sangeet Natak Akedemi of New Delhi, India. The play was released in the Iboyaima Shumang Leela Shanglen, Palace Compound, Imphal.

Jan Dismas Zelenka

Jan Dismas Zelenka (16 October 1679 – 23 December 1745) was a Bohemian baroque composer.

Zelenka was born in Louňovice pod Blaníkem, Bohemia. It is a small market town southeast of Prague. He was baptized as Jan Lukas Zelenka. His first music teacher was likely his father, Jiři. His father was an organist and organist in Louňovice. He received more musical training at the Jesuit college Clementinum in Prague. He learned to play the violone (a kind of contrabass in the Baroque period). 
In 1709, he studied with Johann Hubert Hartig in Prague. Zelenka had access to a lot of Italian baroque music through his teacher's library.
Zelenka moved to Dresden in 1710 or 1711. He became the violone player in the Dresden court orchestra. He received a salary of 300 thalers when he started working in Dresden. He must have been a very impressive musician. His salary was increased to 400 thalers in 1714. He wrote his Mass, the "Missa Sanctae Caeciliae" (St. Cecilia Mass) in 1711.
In 1716, Zelenka visited Vienna to study with Johann Joseph Fux. Fux was the Imperial in Vienna. That means Fux was in charget of the music for the Holy Roman Emperor. It is unclear if he also visited Venice during this time.
Zelenka returned to Dresden in 1719. He visited Prague from 1722 - 23. He wrote some of his instrumental works while in Prague.

The "Kapellmeister" in Dresden at that time was Johann David Heinichen. Because Heinichen was often ill, Zelenka managed the sacred music in Dresden. When Heinichen died in 1729, Zelenka became an acting "Kapellmeister". He finally became a "Kapellmeister" in 1734. In 1726, Zelenka started a list of works composed by the composers in Dresden. This list is called the "Inventarium". It is an important document for Dresden baroque music. 

In the 1730s, a group of Italian-trained singers arrived at Dresden. They were prepared to resurrect opera in Dresden. Zelenka's job was to train these singers. He wrote some arias for the singers to practice. After August II, Zelenka's employer died, Zelenka asked the new King August III for the title of "Kapellmeister". This title was granted to Zelenka on 1734. Johann Sebastian Bach also received the title of "Royal Polish Composer" in 1736. 

On 23 December 1745, Zelenka died of dropsy. Because he was a Catholic, he was allowed to be buried in the Catholic cemetery. According to the records in Dresden, Zelenka never married. He lived alone. His music became valuable after he died. Georg Philipp Telemann tried to publish Zelenka's works. He was not successful. The manuscripts of Zelenka's music remained locked in Dresden. There are no known paintings of Zelenka.

Zelenka's musical style is very unique. He used unexpected harmonies and rhythms. His musical writing shows that he mastered counterpoint. Zelenka may have used elements from Bohemian folk music in his music. He was respected by Bach. Bach performed some of Zelenka's music in Leipzig, where Bach worked.

Colossally abundant number

In math, a colossally abundant number (also written as CA) is a type of natural number that has to follow a special set of rules. CAs usually have a lot of divisors. To figure out whether or not a number is a CA, however, it has to follow an equation. For a number to be colossally abundant, ε has to be greater than 0. "k" a number greater than 1 and σ is the sum of every divisor that the number has.

All colossally abundant numbers are also superabundant numbers, but not all superabundant numbers are colossal.

The first 15 colossally abundant numbers are 2, 6, 12, 60, 120, 360, 2520, 5040, 55440, 720720, 1441440, 4324320, 21621600, 367567200, 6983776800 . These are also the first 15 superior highly composite numbers.

Colossally abundant numbers were first learned about by Ramanujan. They were written about in his paper about highly composite numbersin 1915.

In 1944, Leonidas Alaoglu and Paul Erdős expanded on what Ramanujan's wrote about and learned more about it.

In the 1980s, Guy Robin showed that the Riemann hypothesis is the same for whenever "n" is greater than 5040(γ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant).

This doesn't work for 27 different numbers :

Robin showed that if the Riemann hypothesis is true then "n" = 5040 is the last integer that doesn't work in this equation. This inequality is also known as Robin's inequality.

From 2001–2002 Lagarias showed that Robin's inequality can be written another way. This inequality uses the harmonic numbers instead of logarithms and works for any CA that is bigger than 60.

The next inequality works for when "n" is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 24 or 60.

Christoph Graupner

Christoph Graupner (13 January 1683 – 10 May 1760) was a German composer and harpsichordist.

Graupner was born in Hartmannsdorf near Kirchberg in Saxony. He studied music with Nicolaus Kuester, an organist. Graupner went to Reichenbach with Kuester. He stayed there until he was accepted at the Thomasschule in Leipzig. Johann Schelle and Johann Kuhnau were his music teachers in Leipzig. Graupner also studied law while in Leipzig. At that time, many composers studied law and music.

In 1706, Graupner moved to Hamburg. He became the harpischordist of the Hamburg Opera. Graupner wrote some of his operas in Hamburg. He remained in Hamburg for three years. In 1709, Ernst Ludwig, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt offered Graupner a position as vice "Kapellmeister" at the court of Darmstadt. A "Kapellmeister" is a person who manages the music for a nobleman. Graupner married in 1711. He had six sons and a daughter.

Graupner composed a lot of cantatas in Darmstadt. In 1722 he was chosen to become the "Kantor" of the Thomaskirche in Leipzig. A "Kantor" is a musician who manages the music in a church. However, Graupner decided to remain in Darmstadt. That is because his employer increased his salary. Instead, Johann Sebastian Bach became the next "Kantor" of the Thomaskirche. 

Graupner continued to compose in Darmstadt. Johann Friedrich Fasch was his student. He went blind in 1754. He died in Darmstadt in 1760.

Graupner wrote a lot of music. He wrote 13 sinfonias, 85 ouvertures, 44 concertos, 8 operas, 1,418 religious and 24 secular cantatas, 66 sonatas and 57 harpsichord partitas. Almost all of Graupner's music is kept in the ULB (Technical University Library) in Darmstadt, Germany.

Water clock

A water clock was a tool for measuring time by the flow of liquid into or out of a vessel. Water clocks are one of the oldest time-measuring tools. The bowl-shaped outflow is the simplest form of a water clock and is known to have existed in Babylon, Egypt, and Persia around the 16th century BC. Other regions of the world, including India and China, also have early evidence of water clocks.

A water clock uses the flow of water to measure time. There are two types of water clocks: inflow and outflow. In an outflow water clock, a container is filled with water, and the water is drained slowly out of the container. An inflow water clock works in basically the same way, except instead of flowing out of the container, the water is filling up the marked container. As the container fills, the observer can see where the water meets the lines and tell how much time has passed.

The simplest and more useable clock was a Persian water clock used by manager of the qanat . The use of water clocks in Persia or Greater Iran ,especially in desert area of Iran such as Yazd, Isfahan, and Gonabad,dates back to 500 BC. Later they were also used to say the exact time of holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as telling the time of the equal day and night ( "Nowruz)", "Chelah", or "Yaldā" – the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and nights of the years. The water clocks used in Iran were one of the most practical ancient tools for timing the yearly calendar. The water clock, or "Fenjaan", was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a qanat or well for irrigation, until it was replaced by more accurate current clocks. Persian water clocks were a practical and useful and necessary tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate the length of time they could divert water to their farms or Gardens. The qanat (Kariz) was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation in arid areas so a just and fair water distribution was very important. A very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock called Mir Aab, and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of Fenjans or Pengan hours and announce the exact time of the days and nights from sunrise to sunset because share holders usually were divided to the days owners and night owners. The Fenjaan consisted of a large pot full of water and a bowl with a small hole in the center. When the bowl became full of water, it would sink into the pot, and the manager would empty the bowl and again put it on the top of the water in the pot. He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar. The place where the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as "khaneh Fenjaan" (time house). Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of Sunset and Sunrise. The Zibad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.
it is not clear how Egyptians used water clocks. 
In Babylon, water clocks were of the outflow type and were cylindrical in shape. In Babylonian times, time was measured with temporal hours. So, as seasons changed, so did the length of a day. "To define the length of a 'night watch' at the summer solstice, one had to pour two mana of water into a cylindrical clepsydra; its emptying indicated the end of the watch. One-sixth of mana had to be added each succeeding half-month. At the equinox, three mana had to be emptied in order to correspond to one watch, and four mana was emptied for each watch of the winter solstitial night."

According to N. Kameswara Rao, pots excavated from the Indus valley civilization site of Mohenjo-daro (around 2500 BC) may have been used as water clocks.

Descriptions of similar water clocks are given in the "Pañca Siddhāntikā" by the polymath Varāhamihira (6th century AD), which adds further detail to the account given in the "Sürya Siddhānta".. Further descriptions are recorded in the "Brāhmasphuṭa Siddhānta", by the mathematician Brahmagupta (7th century AD). A detailed description with measurements is also recorded by the astronomer Lalla (8th century AD), who describes the "ghati" as a hemispherical copper vessel with a hole that is fully filled after one "nadika".

In ancient China, as well as throughout East Asia, water clocks were very important in the study of astronomy and astrology. The oldest written reference dates the use of the water clock in China to the 6th century BC. From about 200 BC onwards, the outflow clepsydra was replaced almost everywhere in China by the inflow type with an indicator-rod borne on a float.

Some scholars suspect that the clepsydra may have been used as a stop-watch for imposing a time limit on clients' visits in Athenian brothels. Slightly later, in the early 3rd century BC, the Hellenistic physician Herophilos had a portable clepsydra on his house visits in Alexandria for measuring his patients' pulse-beats. By comparing the rate by age group with empirically obtained data sets, he was able to determine the intensity of the disorder.

The biggest achievement of the invention of clepsydrae during this time, however, was by Ctesibius with his incorporation of gears and a dial indicator to show the time as the lengths of the days changed throughout the year. This is because of the temporal timekeeping used during his day. Also, a Greek astronomer, Andronicus of Cyrrhus, supervised the construction of his Horologion, known today as the Tower of the Winds, in the Athens marketplace (or agora) in the first half of the 1st century BC. This octagonal clocktower showed both sundials and mechanical hour indicators. It featured a 24-hour mechanized clepsydra and indicators for the eight winds from which the tower got its name, and it displayed the seasons of the year and astrological dates and periods.

In the medieval Islamic world (632-1280), the use of water clocks has its roots from Archimedes during the rise of Alexandria in Egypt and continues on through Byzantium. The water clocks by the Arabic engineer Al-Jazari, however, are credited for going "well beyond anything" that had preceded them. At daybreak, the tap was opened and water flowed from the top tank to the bottom tank via a float regulator that maintained a constant pressure in the receiving tank.
In 1434 during the Joseon Dynasty, Jang Yeong-sil, Palace Guard and later Chief Court Engineer, constructed the Jagyeongnu (self-striking water clock or striking clepsydra) for King Sejong.

What made the Jagyeongnu self-striking (or automatic) was the use of jack-work mechanisms, by which three wooden figures (jacks) struck objects to signal the time. This innovation no longer required the reliance of human workers, known as "rooster men", to constantly replenish it. The uniqueness of the clock was its capability to announce dual-times automatically with both visual and audible signals. Jang developed a signal conversion technique that made it possible to measure analog time and announce digital time simultaneously as well as to separate the water mechanisms from the ball-operated striking mechanisms.

After finishing the experiment, they developed todays’ secret recipe for their Milk Chocolate Chip cookie. The Milk Chocolate Chip cookie and Chilled Sugar cookie are now staples on their menu with the Milk Chocolate chip consistently being their best-seller.

Samuel Cooper was born in New Hackensack, Dutchess County, New York. He was a son of Samuel Cooper and his wife Mary Horton. 

In 1813 he entered the United States Military Academy at age 15 and graduated two years later. He was appointed a brevet lieutenant in the U.S. Light Artillery on December 11, 1815. He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1821 and to captain in 1836.

In 1827, Cooper married Sarah Maria Mason who was the sister of James M. Mason. Cooper served as aide-de-camp for Gen. Macomb from 1828 to 1836. Under his supervision authored "A Concise System of Instructions and Regulations for the Militia and Volunteers of the United States".

Cooper served in many artillery units until 1837. That is when he was appointed chief clerk of the U.S. War Department. In 1838 he received a promotion to Brevet major and was appointed assistant adjutant general of the Army. Nine years later, with a brevet as lieutenant colonel, he served in the same capacity.

Cooper's service in the Second Seminole War of 1841–42 was a rare departure for him from Washington, D.C. He was chief of staff for Col. William J. Worth, and after bad relations ended he returned to staff duty in Washington from 1842 to 1845. Cooper received a brevet promotion to colonel on May 30, 1848, for his War Department service in the Mexican–American War, and was promoted to the permanent rank of colonel in the regular army and appointed the army's Adjutant General on July 15, 1852.

Cooper was also a slave owner. At the time of the 1850 census, he owned six slaves. 

On February 5, 1857, his daughter Sarah Maria Mason Cooper (August 4, 1836 – December 15, 1858) married Frank Wheaton, who would become a Union general during the coming war. They had one child, Sarah Maria Cooper Wheaton, in 1858.

At the beginning of the American Civil War, he was loyal to the South. His wife's family was from Virginia. He also had a close friendship with Jefferson Davis, who had also been U.S. Secretary of War. One of his last official acts as Adjutant General of the U.S. Army was to sign an order dismissing Brig. Gen. David E. Twiggs from the army. Twiggs had surrendered his command and supplies in Texas to the Confederacy on March 1, 1861 and Cooper resigned six days later. He traveled to Montgomery, Alabama to join the Confederate States Army.

When he reached Montgomery, Cooper was immediately given a commission as a brigadier general on March 16, 1861. He served as both Adjutant General and Inspector General of the Confederate Army, a post he held until the end of the war. Cooper provided organization and knowledge to the fledgling Confederate War Department from on his years performing such duties as Adjutant General of the U.S. Army.

On May 16, 1861, Cooper was promoted to full general in the Confederate Army. He was one of five men promoted to the grade at that time, and one of only seven during the war. It was the earliest date of rank. 

At the war's end in 1865, Cooper surrendered and was paroled on May 3 at Charlotte, North Carolina.

While building defenses near Washington, D.C., Union forces demolished his home and used its bricks to build a fort dubbed "Traitor's Hill" in dishonor of Cooper.

Cooper's last official act in office was to preserve the official records of the Confederate Army and turn them over intact to the United States government. They form a part of the "Official Records", "The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies". The publishing started in 1880. Military historians have highly regarded Cooper for this action. Historian Ezra J. Warner believed that in doing so Cooper was "thereby making a priceless contribution to the history of the period."

After the war, Cooper was a farmer at his home, Cameron, near Alexandria, Virginia. His house had been taken over by the U.S. government during the war and turned into a fort. But he was able to move into what had been an overseer's house. Due to his age Cooper earned a meager living. On August 4, 1870, Robert E. Lee, on the behalf of other former Confederates, sent Cooper $300. Lee wrote to him saying, "To this sum I have only been able to add $100, but I hope it may enable you to supply some immediate want and prevent you from taxing your strength too much." Samuel Cooper died at his home in 1876, and was buried in the Christ Church Episcopal Cemetery.

Arabization

Arabisation (or Arabization) is a process where the influence of Arabic populations grows in an area. This will mean that the Arab ways of doing things will replace other ways over time. It will also mean that the Arabic lanuage will become more important. Usually, this will also mean that Islam will spread in the area. Non-Arabic populations will be assimilated over time (or leave the area altogether).

Examples where Arabization happened are the south of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal, called Mozarabs), in the Middle Ages (undone by the Reconquista). In the Mahgreb, Arabization drove away many Berber people. Arabization also happened in the Near and Middle East. 

In Sudan and other parts of East Africa, Arabization also took place. In those areas, it was driven by trade.

When Turkish troops and their allies conquered the city of Afrin in Syria, in 2018, they settled Arab people there. According to Kurdish sources, in June of 2018, almost 60 percent of the population of Afrin were Arabs. Before the Turkish troops took the city, the German newspaper, 'Die Welt' reported that ninety percent of the popuation of Afrin had been Kurds.

Badagry is a coastal town, historical city and also a Local Government Area in Lagos State. Badagry is known locally as Gbagle or Gbagli, It is also a border town in Nigeria located on the north bank of Porto Novo Creek, an inland waterway that connects Lagos (Nigeria's largest city and economic capital) to Porto-Novo the Capital of Republic of Benin. According to 2006 census in Nigeria, Badagry has the population of 241,093. 

In 1736 and 1851, Badagry emerged as a commercial center on the West African coast. Because of its connection with lakes, creeks and inland lagoons, these helps people to trade and reside in the ancient town. During the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, the town was a middleman between European traders on the coast and traders from the nearby cities. 
There is a traditional Yoruba story that the first settlement within the area was an Awori group originally from Ile-Ife who lived at a nearby settlement. Robin Law, a scholar of West African history, notes an origin that sprouted out of a resettlement for displaced peoples of varied ethnic groups mostly Ogu people, Ewe people and Oyo Yorubas. Another source links the people living at a settlement called Gberefu as the Ewe's of Oyo, an island along the Atlantic coast.

One of the recorded popular events in the history of Badagry was the acquisition of land by a European trader who was locally known as Yovo Huntokonu. Many sources identify the European to be a Dutch trader called Hendrik Hertogh. Huntokonu arrived from the west, settling in the area after fleeing the wrath of an African chief. He reached the settlement called Apa under the Obaship of Alapa and he was given farmland to use for trading.

The name Badagry was said to be derived from the city's indigenes' methods of subsistence, which include fishing, farming, and salt production. Others think the city was called after Agbedeh, a well-known farmer whose farm, Agbadarigi, was renamed Badagry by Europeans. Badagry served as a corridor for Europeans to carry slaves to new destinations in the early eighteenth century. Its cenotaph is called "Point of No Return," and the well at this location was charmed to make slaves who drank from it forget their fate. Badagry was one of the routes that benefited from the ongoing slave trade conflict between Portnovo and Dahomey at the end of the eighteenth century. Slaves taken during inter-villages conflict were auctioned off at Badagry.

Chief Mobee was one of the African chiefs who participated in the slave trade in 1883. In Marina, Badagry, the first two-story structure was constructed in 1845.

Tabular Islamic calendar

The Tabular Islamic calendar is a variation of the Islamic calendar. It has the same numbering of years and months, but the months are determined by rules rather than by observing the crescent moon directly. The calendar was developed by early Muslim astronomers of the second hijra century (the 8th century of the Common Era). They wanted to be able to predict the positions of the moon, sun, and planets. It is now used by historians to convert an Islamic date into a Western calendar when no other information (like the day of the week) is available. Its calendar era is the Hijri year and its epoch (year 1) is the date of the Hijra (622 in the Common Era or Gregorian calendar).
It is used by some Muslims in everyday life, particularly in Ismaili and Shi'a communities, who believe that this calendar was developed by Ali. They believe that when Ali drew up this calendar, the previous events of the earlier prophets also fell into line with this calendar. It is their belief that all Fatimid Imams and their Da'is have followed this tradition.
Each year has 12 months. The odd numbered months have 30 days and the even numbered months have 29 days, except in a leap year when the 12th and final month Dhu al-Hijjah has 30 days.

Veined tree frog

The veined tree frog, merian frog, common tree frog, warty tree frog, marbled tree frog, lost treefrog, Laurenti's brown tree frog, vein-eyed glue frog, Amazon milk frog, or pepper tree frog ("Trachycephalus typhonius") is a frog that lives in Brazil, Colombia, Nicaragua, Surname, Argentina, Bolivia, Guianas, Paraguay, Argentina, Venezuela, Peru, Trinidad, and Tobago.

This animal is large for a tree frog. The adult male is 7.0 to 10.0 cm long from nose to rear end and the adult female is 9.3 to 11.4 cm long. It has thick yellow, gray, or red-brown skin on its back with a large tan or brown mark. It has strong toes with disks on them for climbing. There is a little webbing on the front feet and more webbing on the back feet. The adult male frog has vocal sacs for singing. Unlike other tree frogs, it has green bones and solid color on its sides. But it can have stripes on its legs. This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. People have seen it high in the tree branches.

This frog lays eggs after big rainstorms. The female lays eggs on the surface of a pond. The tadpoles take 37 to 47 days to become young frogs. The tadpoles have large lungs and large gills. This is because there is not much oxygen in the warm water where they live. They eat algae.

Scientists have seen this frog glide through the air. They call this kind of gliding parachuting. The frog falls in the same direction, with its legs spread out.

This frog makes a sticky white substance in its skin. This substance has chemicals that can cause human beings' skin and eyes to hurt. One of its names "pepper tree frog," comes from the idea that it makes people sneeze, like pepper does. If a snake or other predator tries to eat the frog, it will make this white substance come out of its skin. This will hurt the predator's mouth so the frog can hop away. Because this substance does not dissolve in water, like wax does not, scientists also think it might also stop the frog from drying out and dying.

Amazon milk frog

There is more than one animal called Amazon milk frog:


Bokermannohyla luctuosa

The reservoir tree frog ("Bokermannohyla luctuosa") is a frog that lives in Brazil.

This frog is large for a tree frog. It is 5.5 to 7.0 cm long from nose to rear end. It has large eyes that stick out. Its eardrums are not fully round; they are oval instead. It has disks on its toes for climbing. The skin on its back is brown and the skin on its sides and belly are creamy white. The skin on its legs can be brown with black marks. The male frogs have vocal slits on their necks.

This frog lives in forests. Human beings tend to see it near bodies of water that dry up for part of the year. Human beings to see it on days when it has rained softly.

There are fewer of these frogs than there were. This is because human beings cut down the forests where they live for lumber, to build towns and farms, and to make places for animals to eat grass.

Voiced velar plosive

The voiced velar stop is a type of consonant. The letter for this sound in the International Phonetic Alphabet is ⟨⟩. The X-SAMPA symbol for this sound is ⟨g⟩. The English language has this sound, and it is the sound represented by the "g" in "gear" and "grow".

Linguolabial consonant

Linguolabials or apicolabials are consonants articulated by putting the tip of the tongue against the top-side of the lip. The lip then goes to the tongue.

Linguolabial consonants are not seen very often in languages, but they are not very hard to make with your mouth, unlike click consonants or ejectives. Some languages that do have lots of linguolabial consonants are Vanuatu, Bijago, in Umotína and as paralinguistic sounds. They can be sometimes seen in disordered speech.

They can be typed as to the alveolar consonant that fits it. You can also use the apical diacritic, to the bilabial consonant that fits it.


Voiceless glottal fricative

The voiceless glottal fricative is a type of consonant. The letter for this sound in the International Phonetic Alphabet is ⟨⟩. The X-SAMPA symbol for this sound is ⟨h⟩. The English language has this sound, and it is the sound represented by the "h" in "hear" and "have".

The voiceless bilabial nasal is a type of consonant. It is a rare sound. The letter for this sound in the International Phonetic Alphabet is ⟨⟩. The X-SAMPA symbol for this sound is ⟨m_0⟩. The English language does not have the sound.

Features of the voiceless alveolar trill:

Close vowel

A close vowel, also called a high vowel, is a type of vowel. It is used in many spoken languages. When you say a close vowel, your tongue is very close to the top of your mouth. It isn't touching the top, however, because if it were to touch the top of your mouth, it would be called a consonant.

"Close" is recommended by the International Phonetic Association. In America, however, they are called high vowels.

In the International Phonetic Alphabet are six closed vowels:


There also are three close vowels that don't have symbols in the IPA:


Close front unrounded vowel

The close front unrounded vowel(also called high front unrounded vowel), is a type of vowel. It is an i in the International Phonetic Alphabet. It sounds like the English word "meet." It is also called a long-e in American English. In English this sound has more length then it should and is not usually pronounced as a pure vowel(it is a diphthong). A pure sound can be heard in languages such as French with words like "chic".

English phonology

English is a language with many ways to pronounce things. Pronunciation changes both through history and from dialect to dialect. Mostly, however, English has a mostly similar phonological system throughout the world. Most dialects are different from one another because they have different types of stress in syllables. Stops, affricates, and fricatives are also changed in consonants in different dialects.

There is also lots of research done on prestige(more formal) or standard(more common). These can mean Received Pronunciation for England, General American for the United States and General Australian for Australia.

Many dialects will grow independently from other dialect which make them different from others.

Most dialects in English use the shown 24 consonants. is a little less common. There are, of course, exceptions to all of these in accents such as Hiberno English, New York, South Asian, etc.

The table below shows common examples of words in English that start with these letters.
English has an unusually large number of vowels. In English, vowels in different dialects change a lot. These vowels can also be written differently throughout different dialects. For example, the vowel in is in Received Pronunciation but in General American.

John C. Wells made a popular lexicon set that shows the pronunciation in Received Pronunciation(RP) and General American(GA). It is shown below.

The next three tables show the vowel phonemes in Received Pronunciation, General American and General Australian.

Some of the short vowels may also be combined with ( "bay", "buy", "boy"), with ( , "beau") or with ( "peer", "pair", "poor"). The vowel inventory of English RP in MacCarthy's system therefore totals only seven phonemes. Analyses such as these could also posit six vowel phonemes, if the vowel of the final syllable in "comma" is considered to be an unstressed allophone of that of "strut". These seven vowels might be symbolized , , , , , and . Six or seven vowels is a figure that would put English much closer to the average number of vowel phonemes in other languages.

A radically different approach to the English vowel system was proposed by Chomsky and Halle. Their "Sound Pattern of English" proposed that English has lax and tense vowel phonemes which are operated on by a complex set of phonological rules to transform underlying phonological forms into surface phonetic representations. This generative analysis is not easily comparable with conventional analyses, but the total number of vowel phonemes proposed falls well short of the figure of 20 often claimed as the number of English vowel phonemes.

Piani dei Resinelli

I Piani dei Resinelli o Piani Resinelli is a plateau of the Lombard Prealps, in the province of Lecco, between 1200 and 1300 m above sea level, at within the territory of the municipalities of Abbadia Lariana, Mandello del Lario, Ballabio and Lecco, on the slopes of the Grignetta. it is a base for excursions.

At the end of the 19th century the first shelters were built: in 1899 that of the Milanese excursionist society, in 1911 the Carlo Porta shelter. In 1917 the small church designed by the architect Paolo Mezzanotte dedicated to the Sacred Heart was built.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, with the spread of mountaineering and tourism, the need arose to connect the Piani, then reachable by mule track, to the valley floor by a driveway. The first project, carried out by the engineer Naco Guzzi, dates back to 1915. The Strada Consortile Ballabio - Piani Resinelli arrived on 7 October 1936. The road that was owned by a consortium made up of the four municipalities of Ballabio, Abbadia Lariana , Mandello del Lario and Lecco, had a toll until 1980.

After the construction of the road, the Plans had a tourist development with the construction of shelters, hotels, holiday homes and ski resorts. The practice of skiing at Resinelli has very ancient origins. In February 1913 the SEL (Lecco Excursionist Society) organized the first Italian championships and later a ski jump was built, which was later dismantled.

At the end of the 1950s the first ski lifts were built; in a few years three lifts were opened: the Coltignone and Baby ski lifts and the Campo Scuola ropeway. It was busy as it is excellent for both beginners and more experienced skiers, who could try their hand on the slopes served by the Coltignone ski lift. In the 1980s fewer people came. There was less snow. The ski resorts were abandoned. Today only their ruins remain. During the thirties the Moto Guzzi administrator, Angelo Parodi, built his villa right here. Today his villa belongs to a lawyer from Lecco.

Here the Calolden stream is born.

The Piani Resinelli Mining Park allows visitors to visit the lead-zinc mines located at 1300 m in the formation known as the "metalliferous dolomia". They were exploited from the 16th century until the Second World War.

The adventure park is on the path that leads to the Valentino park consisting of 11 paths in the trees suitable for everyone from 2 to 99 years old. The paths allow you to walk between one tree and another in complete safety equipped with a harness and carabiners, along Tibetan bridges, log walkways and zip line ropes.

In 1961, following the donation made by the Lecco family Gerosa-Crotta to the Italian Touring Club of an area of ​​about 185 hectares extended north of Mount Coltignone, Parco Valentino was born in the Resinelli Plains, at the center of which is the naturalistic museum of the Grigne. .

The Giro d'Italia arrived twice at Pian dei Resinelli.

Here the mountaineer and explorer Walter Bonatti took his first steps.

Russian invasion of Ukraine

On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. The invasion is causing thousands of deaths every month (as of 2024).

It is part of the Russo-Ukrainian War that started in 2014. The 2022 invasion started after the 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis. Russia supported the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic in the months before the invasion.

More Russian soldiers came to the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine on 21 February 2022. The invasion was condemned by many countries. In Russia, many opposition groups formed anti-war protests. Many of the protesters were arrested by the Russian government.

Millions of refugees fled to western Ukraine or to Poland and other foreign countries. Many foreign countries denounced the invasion. On 2 March 2022, United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-11/1 demanded that Russia take its troops out of Ukraine.

At about 06:00 Moscow time (UTC+3), Russian president Vladimir Putin announced a military operation in eastern Ukraine. Minutes later, missile strikes began at locations across the country, including in the capital Kyiv. The Ukrainian Border Service said that its border posts with Russia and Belarus were attacked.

Minutes after Putin's announcement, explosions were heard in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odessa and the Donbas. Ukrainian officials said that Russia landed soldiers in Odessa and Mariupol and launched cruise and ballistic missiles at airfields, military headquarters, and military depots in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Dnipro. Soldiers also went into Ukraine through Belarus. It is the largest attack by one country against another in Europe since World War II.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said that there would be martial law in Ukraine. Later he ordered the Ukrainian Army to kill as many Russian invaders as possible.

Moments after the invasion on 24 February, the Ukraine government said that Russia took Chernobyl and Pripyat. The US government said that the Russians were holding the workers of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant hostage. At 22:00 (UTC+2), Russian forces captured Snake Island after a naval and air attack of the island. The thirteen border guards on the island were thought to have been killed in the bombardment after refusing to surrender to a Russian warship. President Zelenskyy announced that the border guards would be posthumously granted the title of Hero of Ukraine, the country's highest honor. However, it was found out later that the border guards were alive and captured by Russian forces.

On 25 February, while Russian soldiers approached Kyiv, Zelenskyy asked residents to create Molotov cocktails to "neutralise" the enemy. Putin meanwhile called on the Ukrainian military to overthrow the government. Ukraine gave 18,000 rifles (a kind of gun) to Kyiv residents who wanted to fight. Some Russian soldiers did enter northern Kyiv.

On 26 February, heavy fighting was reported to the south of Kyiv, near the city of Vasylkiv and its air base.

The next day, Russia claimed to have captured its first large city, the Black Sea port of Kherson, as fighting intensifies across many parts of Ukraine, including civilian areas. That same day, the International Criminal Court began an investigation into possible war crimes committed in Ukraine.

On 3 March, Ukraine passed a law that states captured Russian military equipment and tanks does not need to be declared and tax will not be applied on them. The next day, Russian forces attacked and bombed the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The main reactor was not hit and fallout did not occur.

On 5 March, Russia announced a temporary ceasefire to allow civilians to leave the cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha. The next day, Vinnytsia International Airport was destroyed by Russian missiles, as President Zelenskyy called for a no-fly zone to stop future attacks in Ukraine.

On 7 March, Ukraine rejected a proposal by Moscow to open refugee passages after Russia said refugees would only be allowed to reach Belarus or Russia.

Putin had denied on 7 February, that Russian conscripts were used in the invasion, because Russian law does not allow the use of conscripts in battle outside Russia. Russian media later said that conscripts were used.

On 2 April, Russia said that the country would not work with Western countries on the International Space Station until the "full and unconditional removal of illegal sanctions". The next day, Ukraine accused Russia and Putin of war crimes because of civilian killings such as the Bucha massacre. U.S. President Joe Biden called for Putin to be tried for war crimes. On 7 April, Russia was suspended from the United Nations Council on Human Rights. This followed a vote which was backed by 97 nations.

Illa de Arousa

Arousa Island, officially in Galician A Illa de Arousa or Illa de Arousa () is the only island municipality in Galicia, Spain in the province of Pontevedra. It is in the heart of the Ria de Arousa. According to 2011 INE the island's population was 5,020 inhabitants. The population is divided into several neighborhoods, and places of interest are the lighthouse's environment, Areoso islet (close to the Illa de Arousa) and Carreirón Natural Park, which is listed as a special protection zone for heron birds populations among other birds that inhabit the island. 

O Santo (The Holy) viewpoint is the highest point on the island. 
""San Xulián da Illa de Arousa"" is the only parish in this island. Some of its beaches are the following ones: A Area da Secada, A Lavanqueira, O Vao, Camaxe, Carreirón, Espiñeiro and O Cabodeiro.

A Illa de Arousa has five ports. Xufre is the most important and the other important docks include O Campo, Chazo and Cabodeiro.

There are two kindergartens ("Galescola - A Galiña Azul" and "Escola infantil 'Sorrisos e lágrimas"' ), one public and one semi-arranged; a primary education center (CEIP ""Torre-Illa""), a secondary education institute (IES da Illa de Arousa ), a municipal music education center and the Galician Institute of Aquaculture Training (Instituto Galego de Formación en Acuicultura, IGAFA). 

There is also an Interpretation Center for Canned Seafood and Fishing, which acts as a museum and receives educational visits from other schools in Galicia.

According to E. Bascuas, "Arousa", registered as "insulam Arauza" in 899, would belong to the old European hydronymy, and is derived from the Indoeuropean root "*er-" 'flow, move'. 

According to M. Santalha, its origin is Arautia or Arautsia. In any case, both have their origin in the Celtic "Arausiu".

There are speculations that relate the place name to a Roman altar (Ara; Ara Augusta)

Scholars say that in "Ara" means ""source of the head"," and in Gaelic ""Before the ear"" (in toponymy refers to a coastal outcrop). Arautia also adds the ending "aunt" of participle, meaning ""the one before the ear"" (and the "ear" turns out to be the Barbanza Peninsula). In this way, Arautia would mean: ""before the ear - Barbanza"" or ""east of Barbanza"".



The Pearl Island

The Pearl Island (Arabic: جزيرة اللؤلؤة, romanized: jazeerat luluwa) in Doha, Qatar, is an artificial island spanning nearly four square kilometers.

Once fully completed, The Pearl Island will create over 32 kilometers of new coastline, for use as a residential estate with an expected 18,831 dwellings and 45,000 residents by 2018. Developed by United Development Company and planned by architecture and design firm Callison, the island is located 350 meters offshore of Doha's West Bay Lagoon area. In 2004, when the project was first revealed, the initial cost of constructing the island stood at $2.5 billion. It is now believed the project will cost $15 billion upon completion.


IGAFA

The Galician Institute of Aquaculture Training ( IGaFA or IGAFA ) is an educational body dependent on the "Dirección Xeral de Innovación e Desenvolvemento" (Directorate General of Innovation and Development) of the Consellería de Pesca e Asuntos Marítimos (Ministry of Fisheries and Maritime Affairs) of the Galician autonomous government (Xunta de Galicia). It is co-financed by the European Social Fund. Courses are taught for obtaining the certificates of shell fisherman, aquaculturist and specialist in marine cultures.

The center is located in the municipality of Arousa Island (Illa de Arousa).

The first attempts to found a "Pisciculture" center in the Ría de Arousa were due to Antón Vila Nadal, at the end of the 19th century, when he proposed the creation of a single Galician Biological Station, located in Carril. In the pamphlet "Objeto y descripción del Acuario Ambulante de la Estación Zoológica de Barcelona y Escuela de Piscicultura de Arosa" (1892) he explained the details and set out his ideas about the Station. In 1900 the first stone of the Station was laid in Carril. Under the auspices of the reform of the Museum of Natural Sciences, the establishment was intended to be created, dependent on the University of Santiago de Compostela and in charge of the professor of Natural History. However, it was not until 1952 that the Marine Research Institute was created in Vigo. 

Much later, public bodies such as the Center for the Control of the Marine Environment (CCMM), CIMA and INTECMAR were created.

In the second half of the 80's, during the presidency of the Xunta de González Laxe, the IGAFA was tendered, the main architect was Pascuala Campos de Michelena, and others collaborated such as Rodríguez Abilleira and Teresa Táboas. Formally, they sought continuity with the large number of canneries on the island, and the Museo do Mar de Galicia, designed in Vigo by César Portela, bears similarities to the IGAFA building. It was inaugurated in 1992, under the presidency of Fraga Iribarne.

Since 2005, IGaFA has been the ""National Center for Occupational Vocational Training in the Aquaculture Training Area"" and has been ISO 9001: 2000 certified by the Quality Management System.

Occupational training courses in aquaculture were initially held at the center until 1994.

It is possible to study diving and aquaculture courses at the center. 

It is part of the "Erasmus +" organization. 

The offer of non-regulated courses includes those of shellfishing and professional diving, since 1999, being the only center in Galicia that provides this training.
The offers of regulated training courses since 1994 is the Specific Vocational Training Cycles :


The center has common facilities for teaching aquaculture and diving, with 11 classrooms for theoretical classes, a library, an auditorium, science and biology laboratories, an audiovisual classroom and a computer room.

For the specific education of aquaculture it has cultivation facilities of 1,175 m with the necessary sections for the conditioning of the breeders, incubation, larval culture, larval feeding ( phytoplankton and zooplankton ) and pre-fattening of cultivated species, in the areas of auxiliary crops, cultivation of fish, shellfish farming and shellfish farming.

In addition, it has four laboratories equipped with optical material for the practices of aquaculture cycles, as well as a workshop on marine culture facilities.

It also has a raft for the cultivation of molluscs, two cages for fattening fish and crustaceans and an intertidal park provided by the Fishermen's Guild of A Illa de Arousa.

In the outer enclosure are located two mini-farms of molluscs, a greenhouse for continental fish farming and facilities of the ""Plan of Repopulation of Marine Species of the Galician Coast" ".

For professional diving lessons, there are equipped rooms, an indoor swimming pool, an outdoor pool, a hyperbaric chamber, a gas charging station, an aquarium room, a welding workshop, a mechanics workshop and several boats.

Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation

In February and March 2014, Russia invaded and annexed (took over) the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine. This event took place after the Revolution of Dignity. It is part of the wider Russo-Ukrainian conflict.

On 22–23 February 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with security service chiefs to discuss how to save the deposed Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych. At the end of the meeting, Putin remarked that "we must start working on returning Crimea to Russia". On 23 February, pro-Russian demonstrations were held in the Crimean city of Sevastopol. On 27 February, masked Russian soldiers in unmarked green military uniforms took over the Supreme Council (parliament) of Crimea and captured strategic sites across Crimea, which led to the installation of the pro-Russian Sergey Aksyonov government in Crimea. This government held the Crimean status referendum, and declared Crimea's independence on 16 March 2014. Russia formally incorporated Crimea as two Russian federal subjects—the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol on 18 March 2014. After the event, Russia deployed more military on the peninsula and came with threats about using nuclear weapons so that Russia could keep its new power in Crimea (or solidify the new status quo on the ground).

Ukraine and many other countries condemned the annexation and consider it to be a violation of international law, as well as Russian-signed agreements safeguarding the territorial integrity of Ukraine, including the 1991 Belavezha Accords that established the Commonwealth of Independent States, the 1975 Helsinki Accords, the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances and the 1997 Treaty on friendship, cooperation and partnership between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. It led to the other members of the then G8 suspending Russia from the group and then introducing a first round of sanctions against the country. The United Nations General Assembly also rejected the referendum and annexation, adopting a resolution affirming the "territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders". The UN resolution also "underscores that the referendum [is not valid, and] cannot form the basis for any alteration of the status of [Crimea]" and called upon all states and international organizations not to recognize or to imply the recognition of Russia's annexation. In 2016, the UN General Assembly reaffirmed non-recognition of the annexation and condemned "the temporary occupation of part of the territory of Ukraine—the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol".

The Russian government opposes the "annexation" label, with Putin defending the referendum as complying with the principle of self-determination of peoples.

The conflict has many names.

In Russia, it is known as

Constantine XI Palaiologos

Constantine XI Dragases Palaiologos or Dragaš Palaeologus (, "Kōnstantînos Dragásēs Palaiológos"; 8 February 1405 – 29 May 1453) was the last Byzantine emperor, started in 1449 until he died in the Fall of Constantinople. His death marked the end of the Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire) and of the Roman Empire, founded by Augustus almost 1,500 years earlier.

Constantine was the fourth son of Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos and Helena Dragaš, the daughter of Serbian ruler Konstantin Dejanović. His early life is unknown, but from the 1420s onward, he is shown to be a skilled general. Based on his career, Constantine must have been a soldier. He was trusted and liked by his older brother, Emperor John VIII Palaiologos. Constantine and John fended off an attack on the Morea (the Peloponnese) by Carlo I Tocco, ruler of Epirus. In 1428 Constantine became Despot of the Morea and ruled the province together with his older brother Theodore and his younger brother Thomas. Together, they ruled almost the entire Peloponnese for the first time since the Fourth Crusade more than two hundred years before. They rebuilt the ancient Hexamilion wall, which defended the peninsula from outside attacks. Although ultimately unsuccessful, Constantine personally led a campaign into Central Greece and Thessaly in 1444–1446, attempting to extend Byzantine rule into Greece.

In 1448, John VIII died without children, and as his favored successor, Constantine was proclaimed emperor on 6 January 1449. Constantine's brief reign would see the emperor grapple with three primary concerns. First, there was the issue of an heir, as Constantine was also childless. Despite attempts by Constantine's friend and confidant George Sphrantzes to find him a wife, Constantine died unmarried. The second concern was the religious disunity within what little remained of his empire. Constantine and his predecessor John VIII both believed a union between the Orthodox and Catholic Churches was needed to secure military aid from Catholic Europe, but most of the Byzantine people opposed the idea. Finally, the most important concern was the growing Ottoman Empire, which by 1449 completely surrounded Constantinople. In April 1453, the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II laid siege to Constantinople with an army perhaps numbering as many as 80,000 men. Even though the city's defenders may have had less than a tenth of the sultan's army, Constantine considered the idea of abandoning Constantinople unthinkable. The emperor stayed to defend the city and on 29 May, Constantinople fell. Constantine died the same day. Although no reliable eyewitness accounts of his death survived, most historical accounts agree that the emperor led a last charge against the Ottomans and died fighting.

Constantine was the last Christian ruler of Constantinople. He became known in later Greek folklore as the Marble Emperor (, "Marmaromenos Vasileus", 'Emperor/King turned into Marble'), reflecting a popular legend which endured for centuries that Constantine had not actually died, but had been rescued by an angel and turned into marble, hidden beneath the Golden Gate of Constantinople awaiting a call from God to be restored to life and reconquer both the city and the old empire.

After he died, the monarchy actually did not finish until 1512, and the last person to hold the title Roman Emperor was Francis I as Holy Roman Emperor.

Scientists think it might also live in Colombia. This frog lives in flooded forests. It might also live in forests that are not flooded.

The adult male frog is 5.2 to 6.0 cm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 5.3 to 6.5 cm long. The adult female frog is brown, reddish brown, and gray to tan. Sometimes the frog has patterns on the back. It has black and near-white lines. The webbing between its toes is red. The sides of its upper hind legs are red. The bottoms of its feet are red. The belly and throat are yellow.

This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. It sits and waits for food to wander by and then catches it.

When a human being picks up this frog, it puffs itself up to look larger than it really is. Scientists think the frog does this to make animal that might eat it go away, but they are not sure. The male frogs also puff up when they sing for females.

When it is time for the female frog to lay eggs, the frogs come to permanent or temporary bodies of water. The male frogs puff up all the way and make loud growling sounds. The female frog lays eggs on the surface of the water.

Ian Kershaw

Sir Ian Kershaw (born 29 April 1943) is an English historian and one of the most famous experts on Nazi Germany.
Kershaw started his job as a historian studying life in the Middle Ages. In the 1970s he changed to studying Nazi Germany. He worked with Martin Broszat's study on what ordinary Germans in Bavaria thought about Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. He then did studies and books of his own, including "" in 1987. Kershaw is also well-known for writing a biography (life story) of Hitler. This was written as two books, one published in 1998 and another published in 2000.
One of Kershaw's most important ideas is the idea of "working towards the Führer". (Hitler called himself the "Führer", a German word for "leader".) This is his idea about why the Nazi government caused World War II, the Holocaust and other mass killings. Kershaw believes that they cannot simply be blamed on just one person, and it is more important to study the rest of the Nazi government and German society. However, unlike his friend Hans Mommsen, Kershaw does not believe that Hitler was a weak ruler. Instead, he thinks that Hitler was powerful but lazy. He believes that events like the Holocaust happened because Hitler's followers were working towards what they thought Hitler wanted them to do.
Kershaw has also written many other books and worked as an advisor to documentaries. In the 2010s, he also wrote books on the wider history of Europe in the 20th century.

Evens

The Even (Even: эвэн, Russian: эвены) people are a native population of Siberia and the Russian Far East. They are sometimes called Ewens or Lamuts.
Evens are Tungusic people. They speak their own language called Even. The Even language was unwritten until the Russians created a written language for them, using the Cyrillic alphabet. Some Evens also speak Yakut or Sakha, and live in the Sakha Republic. Most Evens live in parts of the Magadan Oblast and Kamchatka Krai. They share many things in common with the Evenki people.

Evens are reindeer herders. They are nomads, which means they move from one place to another.
During the 17th century, Russians made contact with the Even people. They introduced diseases to the Evens, such as smallpox and influenza. Russians also made Evens pay the "yasak", which meant they had to pay taxes to the Russian government with reindeer furs. Because of the new diseases and the reindeer population decreasing, the population of the Even people went down.

Evens' religion is a mixture of shamanism and Russian Orthodoxy. Shamanism is a belief that worships animals and nature. There are shamans, people who communicate with spirits. An Even shaman is called a "haman". Evens believe in different kinds of spirits. One of them is a fire spirit called "togh-muranni", which is very powerful. "Ibdiril" are spirits that help the haman. They can look like different people and animals. 

Reindeer are very important to the Even people. They were traditionally sacrificed and used in special ceremonies. Reindeer were used for transportation, along with dogs. One group of Evens living on the Pacific coast didn't have as many reindeer, and depended on fish instead.

Evens lived in clans. Even people had a custom called "nimat", which meant that all of the fish and animals caught were shared with the whole clan.

There are many kinds of folklore in Even culture. "Nemkan" are about people and animals. "Teleng" are long stories that are sung, often about warriors and heroes. "Ike" are short songs, and "nenuken" are riddles.

Bachhan Paandey

Bachchhan Paandey is a 2022 Indian Hindi-language action comedy movie. It was directed by Farhad Samji . The movie was produced by Sajid Nadiadwala. It stars Akshay Kumar, Kriti Sanon, Jacqueline Fernandez and Arshad Warsi. 

The movie is a remake of the 2014 Tamil movie "Jigarthanda." That movie was based on the 2006 South Korean movie "A Dirty Carnival". "Bachhan Paandey" was released in theaters on 18 March 2022.

Myra Devekar (Kriti Sanon), a budding director is given a task by a producer to come up with a gripping and violent gangster story to produce a film. To satisfy the producer's commercial outlook and her hunger for making a realistic flick, she decides to study the life of a real-life gangster for the script. Her extensive research leads to menacing one-eyed Bachchhan Paandey (Akshay Kumar) of Baghwa, a ruthless gangster surrounded by quirky yet scary henchmen. 

Myra travels to Baghwa where she meets her best friend Vishu (Arshad Warsi) and tells him about her film idea on Bachchhan. Vishu gets furious and asks her to leave but is later persuaded to help her with the film. Both Vishu and Myra start to target Bachchhan's henchmen in an effort to get closer to him. Virgin (Prateik Babbar), one of the goons, tells them about his former girlfriend Sophie (Jacqueline Fernandez), who was killed by the former. Vishu and Myra plant a microphone in Virgin's mobile phone to eavesdrop on his conversations with Bachchhan. 

Later, it is revealed that Virgin was betraying Bachchhan for another criminal Rana Lohia but is caught and killed by him. Vishu and Myra listen to the murder through the microphone, but are caught by Bachchhan's gang. Bachchhan sets out to kill Vishu and Myra, but agrees to spare them when he discovers that Myra is directing a gangster movie, under the condition that he plays the protagonist of the film. Myra initially doesn't accept, but Bachchhan kidnaps her producer, and Myra is forced to listen to his backstory to develop the script. 

In a flashback, Bachchhan works for a corrupt politician Laalji Bhagat (Mohan Agashe). After a fallout, the politician gets Bachchhan's girlfriend Sophie killed. In retaliation, Bachchhan murders Bhagat in the hospital where he was admitted for a wound. 

Bachchhan and his goons don't know how to do acting, so they learn through Bhavesh Bhoplo, an acting coach. Bhavesh hits, threatens, and humiliates Paandey and his henchmen, much to their chagrin. Nevertheless, Myra dissuades them from harming Bhavesh for the sake of the movie. Bachchan and Myra start having feeling for One another and Bachchan starts loving Myra.

The film is eventually completed and released in the theatres. Bachchan and his goons initially get excited and promote the film named "BP," thinking it to be the gritty gangster drama that it was marketed as. To their horror, the film turns out to be a comedy that portrays them negatively. On the other hand, Myra's film is proved to be a blockbuster and gets praise from her media and her director who used to often criticize her a lot. Bachchan and his goons decide to kill her for making his fear in people vanish but later on, refrain from him as Bachchan gets evolved by heart and narrates her story that his ears were ringing to hear from her mother calling him and also his fans get impressed by him. Bachchan, later on, becomes a star, and Kaandi, Bachchhan's close goon, gives up his habit of watching porn films. Vishu gets a lead role in an unnamed film. Bhavesh Bhoplo becomes the best acting teacher and Bachchan gets recognized as a best comedy actor with Myra as best director.


Repdigit

In recreational math, a repdigit or a monodigit is a type of natural number. It is only made of the same repeated digit. The word is a portmanteau of repeated and digit. Examples can be numbers like 11, 666, 4444, and 999999. Repdigits are palindromic numbers (read the same forwards and backwards) and are multiples of repunits (a number that only has 1 in it).

Repdigits are the written in base formula_1 of the number formula_2 where "x" is the digit that is repeated (formula_3 is how many times that number repeats. For example, the repdigit 77777 in base 10 is formula_4.

Brazilian numbers are another way of making repdigits. These are numbers that can be written as a repdigit in any base. A Brazilian Number can't be the repdigit 11 and it can't be a number with only one digit. 27 would be a Brazilian number because 27 is the repdigit 33 in base 8. 9 is not a Brazilian number because its only repdigit is 11. The first twenty Brazilian numbers are

Repdigits were studied since 1974. In , it was originally called "monodigit numbers". Brazilian numbers were created later in 1994 in the 9th Iberoamerican Mathematical Olympiad. It took place in Fortaleza, Brazil. The first problem in this competition, proposed by Mexico, was this: 

"A number is called "Brazilian" if there exists an integer "b" such that for which the representation of "n" in base "b" is written with all equal digits. Prove that 1994 is Brazilian and that 1993 is not Brazilian."

Itelmen call themselves "itenme'n-itelmen", which means "an inhabitant of dry land", or "a human being." They are also called Kamchadal. They are related to the Chukchi and Koryak peoples.

Itelmen spoke the Itelmen language. It is a Chukotsko-Kamchatsky language. As of 2016, there are only about 5 native speakers of the language alive, and it is an endangered language. Most Itelmen now speak Russian. There have been efforts to bring the language back since the 1980s.

Kamchadal is the general term for the native peoples of Kamchatka Krai. This includes the Itelmen. Itelmen were called Kamchadals by Russian settlers until 1927. They were fishermen and fur hunters. They were also herbalists, which means they used plants like herbs as medicine.

Itelmens were being converted to Christians as early as the 1730s.

The population of the native peoples of Kamchatka declined from 1769-1770. There were hundreds of Itelmen settlements in the 18th century, but there were only seven Itelmen-speaking villages by the 20th century. Russian became the main language, and Russians spread diseases to the Itelmen, like smallpox. They also suffered from famine.

Kamchadal people suffered from Russian rule. Cossacks kept Itelmen as slaves. Some Itelmen who fought against the Russians were deported, or had their tribes separated.

This can be launched as a rocket or dropped from an airplane as a bomb.

In 2000, Human Rights Watch quoted United States authorities, on how the blast's "kill mechanism against living [things or] targets is unique—and unpleasant... What kills is the pressure wave, and more importantly, the subsequent [vacuum or] rarefaction, which ruptures the lungs... If the fuel [burns or] deflagrates but does not [... explode], victims will be severely burned and will probably also [... breathe] the burning fuel. [... The] most common FAE fuels [or fuel-air explosion fuels], ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, are highly toxic"; Breathing unexploded FAE adds to the risk of (related) death.

John Fire Lame Deer

John Fire Lame Deer (Lakota: Tȟáȟča Hušté; March 17, 1903 – December 14, 1976), also known as Lame Deer, John Fire and John (Fire) Lame Deer, was a Lakota medicine man. He was from the Miniconjou band of the Lakota tribe. His grandfather was the Mincionjou leader Lame Deer, and his son was Archie Fire Lame Deer.

When he was sixteen, he had his first "hanblechia", or "vision-seeking", a Lakota ceremony that is a quest for a vision. Lame Deer named himself after his grandfather after seeing him in a vision.
Lame Deer was born on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota. His father was Silas Fire Let-Them-Have-Enough. His mother was Sally Red Blanket. He lived with his grandparents until he was 6 or 7, and then he was placed in a day school until he was fourteen. He was sent to a boarding school run by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. The boarding school tried to assimilate Native Americans to be more like white people. Lame Deer's mother died of tuberculosis in 1920. His father then moved north to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. He left Lame Deer with land and livestock, which Lame Deer quickly sold.
Lame Deer's young days were rough and wild. He worked in rodeos as a rider and as a rodeo clown. He spent time as a "heyoka", a sacred clown. He also joined the Native American Church. He was a tribal policeman for a short time. He drank alcohol, gambled, and stole cars. He learned English in saloons, prison, and the U.S. Army.

He made his home at the Pine Ridge Reservation. Lame Deer became known to the Lakota and the American public. He performed pipe ceremonies. He went to American Indian Movement events, including sit-ins at the Black Hills, which are a sacred place for the Lakota people. It was taken by the United States government after the discovery of gold in the area.

In 1972, Richard Erdoes published the book "Lame Deer, Seeker of Visions". The book is a collection of interviews with Lame Deer. Lame Deer talks about Lakota culture and his life as a teacher and a healer.

Comedy movie

A comedy movie is a genre of movie which is mainly humorous. These movies are made to make the audience laugh. These movies nomally have a happy ending (black comedy is an exception). Comedy movies are one of the oldest genres in movies. They come from the classical comedy in theatre. Some of the earliest silent movies were comedies. This is because slapstick comedy did not need sound to be entertaining. When sound in movies begen being used in the 1920s, comedy moviess still did well because laughter could come from both situations and dialogue.

Comedy puts much more focus on individual actors. Many former stand-up comics began doing movies because of this. Many comic movies are lighthearted stories. They have no goal other than to make people laugh. Others have political or social commentary.

In "The Screenwriters Taxonomy" (2017), Eric R. Williams says that movie genres are mainly based upon a movies atmosphere, character and story. He says the labels "drama" and "comedy" are too broad to be a genre. Instead, his comedy taxonomy argues that comedy is a type of movie that contains at least a dozen different sub-types.

The first comedy movie was "L'Arroseur Arrosé" (1895). It was directed and produced by Louis Lumière. The movie is less than 60 seconds long. It shows a boy playing a prank on a gardener. The most well known comedy actors of the silent movie era (1895-1927) were Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and Buster Keaton.

The anarchic comedy movie is a random type of humour. It often makes fun of authority. The genre began in the silent era. Notable examples of this type of movie are those made by Monty Python. Others include "National Lampoon's Animal House" (1978) and Marx Brothers movies such as "Duck Soup" (1933).

Gross out movies are a recent creation. They use vulgar, sexual or "toilet" humor. They often have a large amount of profanity. Examples include "Porky's" (1982), "Dumb and Dumber" (1994), "There's Something About Mary" (1998), and "American Pie" (1999).

This type uses comedy to look at serious ideas such as religion, sex or politics. The characters normally have world views that are different from most people. How they interact with other people leads to comedic effect and social commentary. Some examples include "Bob Roberts" (1992) and "MASH" (1970).

A comedy of manners satirizes a social class. The plot of a comedy of manners is often about some scandal. The plot is usuallly less important for its witty dialogue. This form of comedy has been used at least since "Much Ado about Nothing" created by William Shakespeare in 1623. Examples for comedy of manners movies include "Breakfast at Tiffany's" (1961) and "Under the Tuscan Sun" (2003).

The black comedy movie deals with taboo subjects. These include death, murder, crime and suicide. These subjects are used in a satirical way. Examples include "Arsenic and Old Lace" (1944), "" (1964), "S.O.B." (1981), "Monty Python's The Meaning of Life" (1983), "Brazil" (1985), "The War of the Roses" (1989), "Heathers" (1989), "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" (1998), "Thank You for Smoking" (2005), "Burn After Reading" (2008), "The Wolf of Wall Street" (2013), "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri" (2017) and "Parasite" (2019).

Mockumentary comedies are fictional, but use a documentary style. They often have interviews and "documentary" footage along regular scenes. Examples include "The Gods Must Be Crazy" (1980), "This Is Spinal Tap" (1984), "Waiting for Guffman" (1996), "Best In Show" (2000), and "Reboot Camp" (2020).

A parody or spoof movie makes fun of other movie genres or classic movies. These movies use sarcasm, stereotyping and make fun of scenes from other movie and the actions of characters in those movies. Examples of this form include "Mud and Sand" (1922), "Blazing Saddles" (1974), "Airplane!" (1980), "Young Frankenstein" (1974), "Spaceballs" (1987), and "Scary Movie" (2000).

The humor in sex comedy come from sexual situations. Examples include "Choke" (2008) and "Knocked Up" (2007).

Humor that comes from knowing a group of characters (or character types) and then putting them to different situations to create humor. This type of movie includes "Galaxy Quest" (1999) and "Madea's Big Happy Family" (2011).

This type applies to movies that dused comedy for comedic sake. "Clueless" (1995) and "Mrs. Doubtfire" (1993) are examples of straight comedy movies.

Although not a part of the history of surrealism, these comedies have behavior and ways of telling the story that are not logical. Some examples are "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" (1975) and "Swiss Army Man" (2016).

Henrietta Swan Levitt

Henrietta Swan Leavitt (; July 4, 1868 – December 12, 1921) was an American astronomer. 

After she graduated from Radcliffe College, she worked at the Harvard College Observatory.

She examined photographic plates to measure and catalog the brightness of stars. She discovered the relation between the luminosity and the period of Cepheid variables.

This gave astronomers with the first "standard candle" to measure the distance to faraway galaxies.

She discovered the period-luminosity relationship for Cepheid variables. Her work allowed astronomers to measure distances up to about 20 million light years. As a result of this, it is now known that our own galaxy, the Milky Way, has a diameter of about 100,000 light years. 

After Leavitt's death, Edwin Hubble established that the universe is expanding (see Hubble's law). He used Leavitt's period-luminosity relation, and the galactic spectral shifts first measured by Vesto Slipher at Lowell Observatory.

Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians

The Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, also called the Ridge and Valley Province or the Valley and Ridge Appalachians, are a part of the larger Appalachian Mountains area. 

They are an area in the Appalachians that goes from southeastern New York through northwestern New Jersey, into Pennsylvania and through Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama. They are between the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Appalachian Plateau (the Allegheny and Cumberland plateaux). 

They have long, even ridges with long valleys in between the ridges.

The river valleys were areas where people have lived for thousands of years. The Cherokee people had camps along the rivers in western South Carolina, North Carolina and on the western side Tennessee. The Catawba people lived along the Catawba River in western North Carolina.

The ridge and valley system causes problems when traveling in the area even with today's technology. It was almost impossible for settlers traveling west who walked or rode horses to settle in the Ohio Country, the Northwest Territory and Oregon Country. 

Then, animal power was the main form of transportation. There was no safe way to cross east–west in the middle of the area. Crossing was only possible near the ends. There were areas where movement was easier. These included Cumberland Gap, Braddock's Road and Forbes Road. These were later made into America's first National Roads. 

Early settlers of the Ohio country was usually entered by the Ohio River. River systems were the main transportation routes. It was difficult in the late 19th and 20th centuries to build railroads and highways through this area.

The eastern end of the Ridge and Valley region is marked by the Great Appalachian Valley. It is just west of the Blue Ridge. The western side of the Ridge and Valley region is marked by long steep slopes. These include the Allegheny Front, the Cumberland Mountains, and Walden Ridge.

Complementary currency

A complementary currency, or alternative currency, is a medium of exchange that is accepted in much the same way as a regular currency, within a group of people or a geographical area. It is made to complement a national currency. Usually complementary currencies are not legal tender, they cannot be used in exactly the same way as money. Their use is based on all the people of the group agreeing to accept them. According to Jérôme Blanc of Laboratoire d'Économie de la Firme et des Institutions, complementary currencies aim to protect, stimulate or orientate the economy. They may also be used to advance particular social, environmental, or political goals.

There are different kinds of these currencies:


One system, called mutual credit has the idea that there's a form of credit, that is given, but that does not need banks. Another system is that of barter.

A Local exchange trading system, or LETS trades points, where one point is usually equivalent to one hour of work. This is an example for a time-based currency.

Alternative currencies have been made to address specific issues:


The 2006 Annual Report of the Worldwide Database of Complementary Currency Systems presented a survey of 150 complementary currency systems in which 94 respondents said that "all reasons" were selected, among cooperation, micro/small/medium enterprise development, activating the local market, reducing the need for national currency, and community development.

Cahokia people

The Cahokia were a Native American tribe. They were apart of the Illinois Confederation, which was a group of tribes that lived in the Mississippi River Valley. They lived in what is now the Midwest of the United States in North America. They spoke an Algonquian language. The Cahokia were probably similar to other tribes in the Illinois Confederation.

Europeans named a group of man-made earthen mounds after the Cahokia, who lived nearby. However, scholars do not believe that the Cahokia tribe built the mounds.

French missionaries came to proselytize the Cahokia. They made the Tamaroa/Cahokia mission in 1699 CE and the River L'Abbė mission in 1735 CE. The Cahokia's population began to decline in the 18th century. This was probably because of war with other tribes, new infectious diseases, and cultural changes that disrupted their society.

Five Cahokia chiefs and headmen joined the other Illinois tribes at the 1818 Treaty of Edwardsville (Illinois). With this treaty, they ceded half of the state of Illinois to the United States government. The remaining Cahokia became apart of the Kaskaskia and Peoria people. The descendants of the Cahokia are now in Ottawa County, Oklahoma.

Zeppelin LZ 1

The Zeppelin LZ 1 was the first truly successful experimental rigid airship. It was first flown from a floating hangar on Lake Constance, near Friedrichshafen in southern Germany on 2 July 1900. "LZ" stood for "Luftschiff Zeppelin", or "Airship Zeppelin".

Count Zeppelin had been devoting his energies to the design of large rigid-framed airships since his retirement from the army in 1890. In 1898 he established the Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Luftschifffahrt. The company had a subscribed capital of 800,000 Deutschmarks, of which Zeppelin contributed 300,000 Deutschmarks: the remainder was provided by various industrialists, including 100,000 Deutschmarks contributed by Carl Berg, whose company provided the aluminium framework of the airship.

At its first trial the LZ 1 carried five people, reached an altitude of and flew a distance of in 17 minutes, but by then the moveable weight had jammed and one of the engines had failed: the wind then forced an emergency landing. After repairs and alterations the ship flew two more times, on 17 and 24 October, showing its potential by beating the speed record then held by the electric-powered French Army non-rigid airship, "La France" of , but this did not convince the possible investors. Because funding was exhausted, Graf von Zeppelin had to dismantle the airship, sell the scrap and tools and liquidate the company.

Lymantria dispar

Lymantria dispar, renamed spongy moth in 2022, formerly gypsy moth, is a species of moth in the Erebidae family. It has subspecies, for example "L. d. dispar" and "L. d. japonica". "Lymantria dispar" has become an introduced species. It is from Europe, Africa, and Asia, but humans brought it to North America and South America by accident. The larvae (caterpillars) can eat the leaves off broad-leaved and the needles off pine-like trees. The catarpillars can damage trees and forests badly. "Lymantria dispar" is listed among the world's 100 most invasive alien species.

Scientists call moths in the subfamily Lymantriinae "tussock moths" because of the tufts of hair on the caterpillars.

The name "Lymantria dispar" has composed of two words that both come from Latin. The genusc name "Lymantria" means "destroyer." The species epithet "dispar" means "to separate" in Latin; it refers to the large differences between the male and female adult moths. In some subspecies, the adult male can fly and the adult female cannot.

In July 2021 the Entomological Society of America, a group of scientists who study insects and other animals with skeletons on the inside decided to remove the name "gypsy moth" from its Common Names of Insects and Related Organisms List because it is "hurtful to the Romani people." The Society looked at more than 200 names. They chose the new common name "spongy moth" because it matches names for the species in other languages. For example, in French, it is "spongieuse." The moth makes a sponge-like substance to put its eggs in. The Society agreed to use the name in February. Every person on the committee voted yes.

Scientists say the North American and European "Lymantria dispar" moths are the same subspecies, "Lymantria dispar dispar". But not all scienitsts agree. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says the Asian subspecies is any kind of "L. dispar" in which the female adult can fly despite "L. d. asiatica" not being the only accepted subspecies that is capable of flight. Traditionally, "L. dispar" has been referred to as "gypsy moth" even when referring to Japanese, Indian and Asiatic spongy moth populations.

The European subspecies ("Lymantria dispar dispar") is native to forests in western Europe. It was introduced to the United States in 1869 and to Canada in 1912.

The Asian subspecies ("Lymantria dispar asiatica") is native to Asia east of the Ural mountains. Since the early 1990s it has also reached the West Coast of North America. From southern Europe it is spreading north into Germany and other countries, where it mates with the European spongy moth, "L. d. dispar". Someone found a colony of these animals in Great Britain in 1995.

In North America, the parasitoid encyrtid wasp "Ooencyrtus kuvanae" was introduced to kill the spongy moth. However, the wasp also attacks the eggs of other Lepidoptera species.


Heil dir im Siegerkranz

"" (; German for "Hail to Thee in the Victor's Crown", literally: "Hail to Thee in the Victor's Wreath") was the official national anthem of the German Empire from 1871 to 1918.
Before the foundation of the Empire in 1871, it had been the royal anthem of Prussia since 1795 and remained it after 1871. The melody of the hymn derived from the British anthem "God Save the King". but it also was never recognized by the southern German states, such as Bavaria and Württemberg. After World War I, the German Empire came to an end and "Das Lied der Deutschen" became the national anthem of the Weimar Republic.

Queen (movie)

Queen is a 2013 Indian Hindi-language comedy-drama film directed by Vikas Bahl. It was produced by Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane, and Madhu Mantena. It stars Kangana Ranaut in the lead role, with Lisa Haydon and Rajkummar Rao playing supporting roles. The film follows the story of Rani Mehra, a diffident Punjabi girl from New Delhi who embarks on her honeymoon to Paris and Amsterdam by herself after her fiancé calls off their wedding.

Rani Mehra is a 24 year-old sheltered, meek, yet good-natured young Punjabi woman from Delhi. One day before her wedding, her fiancé Vijay Dhingra (Rajkummar Rao) tells her that he no longer wishes to marry her. He explains that his lifestyle has changed after living abroad, and Rani's conservative habits would be a wrong match for him. Stunned at the development, Rani shuts herself in her room for a day recalling her and Vijay's story of how they met and fell in love. Wanting to control the situation, she asks her parent's permission to go alone on her pre-booked honeymoon to Paris and Amsterdam. After initially hesitating, her parents agree, thinking that a vacation might cheer her up.
In Paris, Rani meets Vijayalakshmi (Lisa Haydon), a free-spirited woman of French-Spanish-Indian descent, who works at the hotel in which Rani stays. Overwhelmed by the new city and having gotten into trouble twice – once with the local police and once with a robber – Rani intends to return to India. However, Vijayalakshmi helps her out and gives her a tour around the city. The two have a series of adventures, during which Rani relives the memories of Vijay patronizing her and forbidding her from dancing and drinking – which she's free to do in Paris. During one particular incident, Rani tries on what she considers to be a revealing outfit and accidentally sends a selfie of her wearing the attire to Vijay instead of Vijayalakshmi due to the similarity in their names. Rani quickly realizes her mistake, but unbeknownst to her, the selfie revives Vijay's interest in Rani and he decides to seek her out. Eventually, the time comes for Rani to bid an emotional farewell to Vijayalakshmi and board the Dutch Sprinter train for Amsterdam. However, when Rani arrives in Amsterdam, she finds that her hostel room is being shared with three men: Taka from Japan, Tim from France, and Oleksander from Russia. Despite being skeptical, she soon becomes good friends with them and spends time shopping, sightseeing, visiting a sex shop, going to a church, and meeting pole dancers in a club. Rani befriends a pole dancer at the club, Roxette/Rukhsar (Sabeeka Imam), a Pakistani girl who is the sole breadwinner for her family back in Lahore and who is also a friend of Vijaylakshmi.

Rani slowly begins to gain confidence by taking control of her decisions. Realizing her earning potential, she wins a cook-off by selling gol gappas. After the cook-off event, the Italian host and restaurant owner shares an intimate moment with her when she experiences her first 'Indo-Italian' kiss with him and proves that Indians are the best in cooking and even lip to lip kissing. She learns more about her friends' backgrounds and begins to understand how different life can be for people in other parts of the world. One day, the four friends find Vijay waiting for Rani in front of the hostel. Vijay apologizes to Rani and asks her to reconsider the relationship. Their conversation escalates as he tries to grab hold of Rani, but her friends retaliate, and she asks him to leave. Rani decides to miss out on a concert with her friends to meet with Vijay and discuss their future. A conservative thinking Vijay judges Rani's new friends and behavior, like drinking champagne and her choice of living with roommates of the opposite gender, and tells her that she doesn’t know foreigners. This causes her to leave abruptly, saying that she would rather speak to him after returning to Delhi. She then meets up with her friends one last time at the concert.

Charlie Strapp and Froggy Ball Saves The Chicken (movie)

Kalle Stropp och Grodan Boll räddar Hönan is a 1987 Swedish animated short film directed by Jan Gissberg about the two eponymous characters created by Thomas Funck. Funck also provides all voices. The film was released theatrically in Sweden on 12 December 1987.It was followed in 1991 by the feature-length film "Charlie Strapp and Froggy Ball Flying High", made by the same team.
One day Charlie Strapp's good friend The Chicken is kidnapped by two villains Pudding and Karlsson. Charlie Strapp, who has just been invited by Froggy Ball to get in his new car, constructed by Sheet-Niklas and himself mainly out of an old shoe and a well-shaken soda bottle, begins the chase. But the start is miserable as their other friend The Parrot also ends up being kidnapped. It turns out, though, that the kidnappers might not be purely evil after all: they work as stage magicians and just happen to need a hen for a trick they are performing. Charlie Strapp and the others continue to chase the kidnappers through air, on the ground and on water skis until the final showdown. Maybe they can find another trick.

Charlie Strapp Froggy Ball And Their Friends (movie)

Kalle Stropp, Grodan Boll och deras vänner is a 1956 Swedish live-action/stop-motion feature film directed by after an original script by Thomas Funck, using Funck's already well-established characters. It was followed by a shorter animated film in 1987, "Kalle Stropp och Grodan Boll räddar Hönan". This is the first time since before 1987 where a Kalle Stropp production features voice acting by others than only Funck himself, only with the exception of children that had participated in other productions as well.
Thomas Funck sits with two children and finishes writing the film's subtitles. He begins to tell:It's early in the morning. A lot of baker-clad children collect eggs in a chicken farm. Then they go to the sleeping baker and wake him up, and the baking of the day's bread can begin. When the children later go out to deliver the bread to the customers and the bakery is empty, Kalle Stropp arrives there together with Grodan Boll, Plåt-Niklas, Räven and Papegojan. They are like little insects in the big bakery. But Plåt-Nikla's cure for this. He utters a magic formula, and immediately the bakery shrinks so that the little friends can work unhindered in it. Namely, they will bake a cake to court the guard parade who turns four years old. Without the bakers noticing anything, two sotis, Sot and Tos, sneak into the bakery and steal Plåt-Niklas' propeller which he carries on his back. Then they disappear. Plåt-Niklas discovers the loss, when it's time to whip cream, and becomes very sad. Shortly afterwards, the sotis make themselves known. They have taken care of the propeller, they say. And now they will disappear forever. They should only turn off the light first. They blow - and the electric light goes out. The sotis come to Kalle Stropp's meadow, where they find an egg that they crack, empty and then hide in. Kalle Stropp, Grodan Boll, Plåt-Niklas, Räven and Papegojan come to the meadow. The fox carries the freshly baked cake. Here they meet Hönan who complains that an egg has been stolen from the chicken farm. Kalle Stropp picks up a magnifying glass and starts scouting - and soon finds the egg, the sotis' hiding place. The hen gets the egg back. While Hönan is sleeping, however, the sotis manage to escape, and then they also seize the cake, "guarded" by the equally sleeping Räven. The sotis are discovered, but they go to the beach, jump into the water and disappear with their prey. Now Kalle Stropp gets an idea. From an old boot, he and his friends build a submarine that takes them to the opposite shore. There they chase into a secret passage that they follow, guided by vultures. The aisle ends with Gubben Glömsk and Gumman Kom ihsj who offer a ride in their car - which Plåt-Niklas f ö recognizes as his aunt. Soon, however, the car stops. The petrol is out. Kalle Stropp and his friends can continue on foot. The Sotis have left clear traces that they follow. They come to a tower, and the tracks continue up the tower wall. They climb up - and are captured and bound by the sotis. But now comes the rescue in the form of the guard parade. The captain fires a cannon and threatens to fire a pea unless the sotis release their prisoners. A moment later, Kalle Stropp and his friends are freed, and Plåt-Niklas regains his propeller. The fox has saved the cake. And Frog Boll gets the conciliatory inspiration that the sotis may not be so mean after all - only they can wash themselves. The guard parade's birthday is celebrated with cake and song in a toy store. Kalle Stropp and his friends are of course there - as are the sotis, clean-washed and party-dressed. The end is good, everything is good, says Grodan Boll.

Natural gender

Natural gender is a linguistic category for the sex of real life beings, both the biological sex of animals or the social identity of a person. The sex, of humans and animals, is marked in many languages by a corresponding grammatical gender and specific words. The term "sex" (or "sexus") does not apply to words that do not refer to living things. For example: the word "table" is grammatically feminine in Spanish, but tables are not "feminine". The gender of words in those languages divides words into "grammatical classes" (into genders), which require a language for all nouns.

It has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. The book was published in 1997. It was well liked in Russia. Because of the book powerful Russian politicians have taken an interest in Dugin. He was a Russian Eurasianist, fascist, and nationalist. Dugin has formed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

Dugin has said that General Nikolai Klokotov of the Academy of the General Staff helped him write the book. Klokotov says this is not true.Colonel General Leonid Ivashov helped write the book.

Klokotov said that the book would "serve as a mighty ideological foundation for preparing a new military command". Dugin has said that the book has been used as a textbook in many Russian schools. Former speaker of the Russian State Duma, Gennadiy Seleznyov has "urged that Dugin's geopolitical doctrine be made a compulsory part of the school curriculum".

In "Foundations of Geopolitics", Dugin says that the United States should not have any effect on Eurasia. He wants Russia to rebuild its power through annexations and alliances.

The book says that "the battle for the world rule of Russians" has not ended. It also say that Russia is still "the staging area of a new anti-bourgeois, anti-American revolution". The Eurasian Empire will be built "on the fundamental principle of the common enemy: the rejection of Atlanticism, strategic control of the USA, and the refusal to allow liberal values to dominate us."
Military operations are not a large part of his plan. The textbook says subversion, destabilization, and disinformation should be used. They should also use Russia's gas, oil and other natural resources to pressure other countries.

Historian Timothy D. Snyder wrote in "The New York Review of Books" that "Foundations of Geopolitics" is influenced by the work of Carl Schmitt. Scmitt was a supporter of a conservative international group whose work influenced the Nazis. He also said that Dugin's was important in getting people to talk about the iideas of Eurasianism and National Bolshevism.

In 2017, news.com.au said that the book "reads like a to-do list for Putin's behaviour on the world stage".
