Salyut 1

Salyut 1 was the first ever space station sent into space. It was launched into orbit in April 1971 by the Soviet Union and stayed in space until October 1971. During its time in space, it was visited by two spacecraft with crews. The purpose of Salyut 1 was to learn and test how a space station worked. A second goal was to find out how being in space a long time affected the human body. It had a number of problems, but a lot was learned from it that helped with future stations. 

The station was at first part of the Almaz program, to make a secret military station in space. On 16 February 1970 it was decided to make it civilian instead. The Soviet space program gave the name DOS to the program. That is an abbreviation of the Russian "Dolgovremennaya Orbitalnaya Stanziya" which in English means "Long Term Orbital Station". The first station was called DOS-1 by the people working on the space program. To the public, it was going to be called Zarya, but was changed to Salyut before launch. Salyut is the Russian word for salute and was given to honor Yuri Gagarin.

The station was shaped like a cylinder and had four areas. One was a docking module to allow a spacecraft to connect. The second was the main module where people could live. The third was the auxiliary module that had the equipment to run the station. The fourth had the engines to move the station. Besides these, the station had four solar panels.

The launch was on 19 April 1971 on a Proton K rocket. Two days later, the first crew was also launched on a Soyuz rocket. They were supposed to stay for 30 days at the station. This did not happen as there was a problem in docking (connecting) their spacecraft to the station. After trying for 5.5 hours, they had to return to Earth. A second crew (Soyuz 11) was sent on 6 June 1971 and was able to enter. At first the mission went well, but due to problems on the station they could only stay 23 days of the planned 30. Their stay was the longest any people had spent in space at that time. While at the station, they did experiments to help scientists understand life in space. The crew of Soyuz 11 died during re-entry of the atmosphere when their air escaped. No other spacecraft visited the station. Salyut 1 was de-orbited (removed from space) on 11 October 1971. The engines were used to lower the orbit, so it would burn up in the atmosphere. 

The design of Soyuz 1 proved to be a good one. Later long-term stations such as Salyut 7 and Salyut 8 were based on it. And parts of Mir and the Zvezda module of the International Space Station were also based on this design.

Soyuz 1 was followed by the Salyut 2 station, which failed.

Ejipura

Ejipura is a small sized neighbourhood that is located in southeast Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It is a compact neighbourhood that houses many areas of residence, schools, parks, provision stores and other recreational facilities. It is neighboured by other residential areas like Koramangala, Adugodi and Madiwala. The locality is known for its narrow roads and high slum population. It is also well known for the eviction of over 5,000 people who were a part of the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) of Ejipura, in order to build way for a shopping mall. 

Ejipura is a direct extension of Vannarpet, that settled towards the East of Bangalore. Earlier, it was often known as Equestrian Grounds Puram, which later became E.G Puram. It was initially a colony that was situated next to the Equestrian Grounds that had been used by the army. The grounds were used by several workers who looked after the horses and their stables.

Ejipura houses not only a strong rural population but also houses people from the North East and other Eastern cities like Bihar. It also consists of a large urban population, and several urban gated communities and apartments. 

During the start of the year 2005, BBMP had passed a decision which provided housing and residence on the same piece of land for the people residing in Ejipura. In early 2006, the BBMP had then issued for a rights/identification certificate to the residents of the locality. However, a Public Private Partnership between the BBMP and Maveric Holdings had come into contract and was signed in order to develop the same piece of land that was given to the EWS. 

As a section of the joint development agreement, it was said that half of the land was then to be used in order to construct 1,512 EWS apartments. The other half of it was to be used by Maverick Holdings Corporation in order to build a mall. The eviction of residents had been stalled several times, even after several rights groups had staged protests, alleging that the projects seemed like a land scam. The citizen groups and protestors had accused the BBMP of constructing just 1,512 houses and residences within a site that could host up to 3,000 houses, by choosing to split the land equally with a private builder.
Following directions of the Court order, the private builder, Maverick Holdings, alleges to have given a remuneration amount of Rs. 30,000 to families who had been evicted from the land. After this, an arrangement the government and Maverick had met half way and decided to build houses for the residents who took to the streets for shelter.

The project did commence only until recently. Due to the setbacks in starting the work, a group of original residents had filed a petition of contempt in the High Court, which questioned the delay in project commencement. Due to this, the court had requested that the Principal Secretary of the Urban Development Department (UDD) observe the happenings of the project and to submit a report to them. After having acquired the plan for the sanction to the EWS housing, the builders commenced the work in the year 2017. 

In the year 1983, the Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BMP) that was in power at the time had begun the establishment of EWS houses in the new locality of Ejipura, at the price of Rs. 223 crore, employing a HUDCO loan. The residential project was completed in 1991. During the years 1993 to 1994, these residences were given to the EWS families, who had to previously apply in order to get the houses sanctioned. Exactly 1,512 houses had been constructed in within 42 blocks (36 houses in each block) within a 10.30 acre land.
In the year 1992, there was the construction of the Ejipura Quarters which was built for policemen to reside in. It was rejected by the police men because the standard of construction was defective and subpar. The civic agency had then assigned this facility to the EWS that were present in Ejipura. Some residents chose to stay while the others had rented it out. The buildings had then been discovered to accommodate several people that lived among the poor living conditions. On account of the poor formation of the building, walls and ceilings began to crack and killed 3 people in 2003. All the blocks of the quarters were then deemed unsafe for residence. Ever since these events took place, several people have been living by the side of the demolished residence in tin sheds. 

Sri Prasanna Veeranjeneya Swami Temple

The Sri Prasanna Veernanjeneya Swami Temple is at Mahalakshmi Layout, Bangalore. It is one of the temples dedicated to Lord Hanuman which is quite famous in Karnataka as Lord Hanuman’s birthplace is Karnataka. There are more than 100 temples dedicated to Lord Hanuman in Bangalore City. People in Karnataka have special attachment and reverence to Lord Hanuman. There are plenty of monkeys in all tourist spots in India, especially at pilgrimage points. The monkey creates a psychological feeling in man that not only it is man’s ancestor but also a replica of Lord Hanuman.

While entering first there is a huge Vigraha of Mahalakshmi and before entering the main Anjaneya area, on the left in separate sannidhis are marble Vighrahas of Lord Ganapathy, Rama, Sita Lakshmana Anjaneya and Lakshmi. The Anjaneya Vigraha is sculpted. It is 22 ft high and 16 ft wide. Mahalakshmi Vighraha is 12 ft in height and seated on a lotus of 5ft height. Every Saturday the temple does the Benne Alankara which requires around 600 kgs of butter.

Mahalakshmi Layout was a mostly barren land with small hills and rocks. After independence, the place was called “No Man’s Land” as it was outside the Bangalore region. The deity was carved by a sculptor named Shanmugananda. He felt that the place had a spiritual aura and thus spent months sculpting Lord Hanuman, beginning with a sketch. Eventually devotees began visiting the sculpture and engaged in doing Puja to the god. During the 1960s, Mahalakshmi Layout showed signs of developing. In the early 1970s, as the city expanded, and the hill was registered within the city limits, the local residents hired professional artists to enhance the earlier outlined sketch, into a grand painting of Lord Hanuman. By the mid-1970s, the authorities decided to turn the painting into a sculpture and formed a high-level committee (involving local residents) for this purpose. In 1976, the sculpture was ready and inaugurated by the Hindu tradition with their priests. PV Narasimha Rao was invited as the Chief Guest for the ceremony. By 1980, a 40×40 ft temple was ready, which went on to expand into a 13-acre temple complex with the help of generous donations by devotees over the next few years, and it became part of the “Must-Visit” list of sightseeing in the city. Over the years, the Temple was developed by the devotees and by the local people and made it a full fletched place of worship.

Hindu Temples are usually filled with festivals and celebration and this temple, in particular, celebrates important festivals like Hanuma Jayanthi, Sri Rama Navami, Annual Day Function, Sri Rama Pattabhisheka, Sri Rama Kalyanotsava and Lord Sathyanarayanan Pooja on Full Moon days, Lakshmi Pooja and other festivals in Shravana month. One of the most important events that take place is called the "Benne Alankara" in the month of August during which the deity is decorated with more than 500 kg of butter which is later given to the devotees as Prasadham

Sri Prasanna Veernanjeneya Swami Temple is in 12th Cross Road, Mahalakshmi Layout, Mahalakshmi Puram, Bangalore. It is 320m from the Mahalakshmi layout metro station. The entrance to the temple can be made from the main road through the park or from the side road , where people park their vehicles.

Defence Colony was originally a settlement of defence veterans started in the 1970s. The government allotted land to high ranking retired defence officers here. It was a sparse collection of Large Bungalows. At the time Indiranagar was a suburb, far outside Bangalore city. The Information Technology boom in the 1990s led to the rapid development of the neighbourhood, transforming Indiranagar into an upscale area. With increasing commercialisation of the surrounding areas, demand to live in this neighbourhood grew. As a result, property prices in Defence Colony rose over the years. Many of the owners sold their property to builders who put up apartments or developed it into apartments themselves. Today Defence Colony is largely made up of apartments. 

Defence Colony is located only a few minutes away from the Indiranagar Metro Station. Auto Rickshaws are easily available on the main roads bordering the colony.

Defence Colony has a very active Residents Welfare Association. The Defence Colony Residents Association or DECORA is a voluntary association that looks after the interests of the residents of the colony. The association acts as a method for collective action by the residents. While the original function was to guard against illegal encroachment, the association also looks after civic amenities, residents welfare, security and communicates with local authorities to solve issues faced by residents. They have enforced zoning norms by shutting down 15 commercial establishments in the locality and protected two neighbourhood parks from encroachment. 

the incidents of street crime has been increasing over the years especially during the night. Defence Colony and surrounding areas suffers from a high rate of street crime with incidences of chain snatching, harassment and robbery reported regularly.

Blunderbuss

The Blunderbuss is a short, muzzleloading smoothbore gun, similar to a musket or carbine but has a bigger barrel designed for multiple pellets to be put in. It is considered to be a precursor to the shotgun. A blunderbuss in handgun shape was called a "dragon" which made way for the word "dragoon".
The term "blunderbuss" is from the Dutch language, from the Dutch word "donderbuis", which is a fusion of "donder", meaning "thunder", and "buis", meaning "Pipe" (Middle Dutch: "busse", box, tube, from Late Latin, "buxis", box, from Ancient Greek "pyxίs" (πυξίς), box: esp. from boxwood).

The evolution from "donder" to "blunder" is thought by few to be done on purpose; the term "blunder" was originally used in a transitive sense, synonymous with "to confuse", and this is thought to describe the very loud sound of the large-bore, short-barreled blunderbuss. The term "dragon" is taken from detail of older models that were designed with a carving in the shape of a dragon's head around the barrel; the muzzle blast would then give the impression of a fire-breathing dragon.

Kaikondrahalli Lake

Kaikondrahalli Lake is in Kaikondrahalli on Sarjapur Road, south east Bangalore and is spread over 48 acres of land. It is one of the traditional tank system in Bangalore which was created over hundreds of years ago and connected through a web of canals to different lakes. This was also used to provide water to the agricultural lands around the area. The region around the lake has encountered an expansion in land estate in the previous decade. 

Around the year 2000, the lake was filled up with fresh water and surrounded by various flora and fauna. By 2003, the lake had started to dry up as various channels to the lake was blocked due to construction and dumping of garbage. By 2007, the lake bed was a slushy bed of sewage and waste. This lake was later restored and is an example of urban commons revived by the local community with the help of the municipal corporation, BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike).

In 2008, Priya Ramasubban, a documentary film maker and a local resident of Kaikondrahalli saw a report in the newspaper about a BBMP initiated rejuvenation program for the lake. Realising the then state of the Kaikondrahalli lake, she and other residents formed a small core group who invited other members with technical expertise to join them in the planning of rejuvenating Kaikondrahalli lake. The Detailed Project Report (DPR) had already been prepared and the budget had been sanctioned. The original DPR was looked into and redesigned to focus more on ecology than just the aesthetics of the lake park. Local residents contributed funds and collected hundreds of saplings of native species for plantation in the lake premises. Along with the local community, the then chief engineer of the lakes division of BBMP, Mr. BV Sathish coordinated with the local residents in the restoration of the lake.

Some of the changes made from the original DPR were to retain as much area under water as possible as the area around the lake is dependent on ground water. Using inputs from a local architect, access to the lake was provided to lake visitors as well as to the children of the school adjacent to the lake, which originally had to be fenced off from the lake. Washrooms were constructed and it could be used by the lake visitors and the school children. To prevent the main lake from getting polluted, the DPR was redesigned to build a separate enclosure at the corner of the lake for the immersion of idols during Ganesh Chaturthi and other religious festivals. The infrastructure was completed and water started flowing in after four years from its commencement of restoration. The small core group residents formed themselves into a non-profit trust called MAPSAS (Mahadevapura Parisara Samrakshane Mattu Abhivrudhi Samiti). The lake has been restored and maintained jointly by MAPSAS, BBMP and the local community. 

On February 4th, 2012, Nobel Laureate, Elinor Ostrom, American political economist, visited the Kaikondrahalli lake to look at its restoration work by the local community. A plaque regarding the same has been installed next to a jackfruit tree planted by Elinor Ostrom.

The group of residents responsible for the rejuvenation of the Kaikondrahalli lake formed a non-profit trust called MAPSAS (Mahadevapura Parisara Samrakshane Mattu Abhivrudhi Samiti) in 2011. The trust was formed to rejuvenate and maintain the chain of lakes such as Parappana Agrahara lake, Kudlu Dodda kere, Kudlu Chikka kere, Haralur lake, Kasavanahalli lake, Kaikondrahalli lake and Saul kere from the Parappana Agrahara series and Dodda Ambalipura, Chikka Ambalipura, Ibblur and Bellandur form another chain nearby. MAPSAS and the BBMP are jointly responsible for maintenance of these lakes. While the BBMP takes care of the initial big investments on infrastructure, MAPSAS takes care of the other aspects of daily maintenance. 

Kere Habba (Lake festival) is an annual celebration of the lake at the Kaikondrahalli lake. It features organic and eco-friendly santhe, live music performances, storytelling sessions, workshops, activities and a conference. This is a one-day sunrise to sunset event which focuses on two objectives – to show the significance of lakes and as a fundraiser for the maintenance of the lake. On 16th February, 2020, MAPSAS along with BBMP conducted its 6th edition of this festival which took place from 6am to 6pm, with events such as the bird walk, kere run, photography workshop, puppet show, storytelling, Yakshagana, etc. 

As the resources reduced for the monthly maintenance of the lake, in 2017 four residents from around the lake, Pushpa Krishna, Rinaz Mohammad, Padma Srinivas and her husband Srinivas Sampath, took part in the 42 km Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon (SCMM) and individually started a fundraiser on Milaap for the upkeep of the lake. Altogether they raised up to nearly 3.3 lakhs for the maintenance of the Kaikondrahalli lake. Other than this, every year, Kere Habba is celebrated which is also a fundraiser collected through various stalls and activities conducted from sunrise to sunset on one particular day. 

In 2014, a survey was conducted to identify the various Flora and Fauna species at the Kaikondrahalli lake. According to the survey, around 43 species of birds, 26 species of reptiles and 3000 plants comprising at least 33 varieties have been identified. Many migratory birds also visit this biodiversity lake from October to March. This in turn gathers many photography enthusiasts and bird watchers to the lake.

The park has various facilities such as walking/jogging pathway, washroom, play areas, parks, cycling tracks, butterfly garden and an amphitheatre. People can also bring their pets with them to the park from 5am – 11am and 3pm to 7pm. 

In the recent years, the lake has been suffering from algal growth and stench due to the sewage entering the lake from a close by private property. To resolve this issue MAPSAS had taken an initiative to pour Effective Microorganism (EM) solution into the lake. Few days after that, MAPSAS and volunteers from around the area gathered to make bokashi balls (Japanese technique that clears off sludge) to dump in the lake. It was made using the bokashi powder (containing sawdust and husk), mixed with cow dung, red mud sludge from the lake, jaggery and effective microorganism (EM) solution. This mixture was then rolled into balls and left to activate, after which it was dumped in the lake. 

During every summer, since 2018, the lake water has had algal bloom and the stench. Pouring of EM solution and dropping Bokashi balls into the lake has only become a temporary solution. MAPSAS also took initiative in seeking the BBMP Lakes team’s help in initiating an underground drainage system to diverge sewage water from the lake, as a long-term relief. The BBMP has thus decided to spend Rs.3 crore for constructing diversion drain at Kaikondrahalli lake. 

In 2013, as an initiative by the Stockholm Resilience Centre, Swedish University, a documentary film, 'Kaikondarahalli lake – The Uncommon Story of an Urban Commons', was released. Harini Nagendra, an ecologist and a community member of the Kaikondrahalli lake was approached by Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom to do a research project on the conservation of the Kaikondrahalli lake by the local community. The film was has two versions- a three minute clipping to screen during seminars and conferences and a longer version which was uploaded to the biodiversity page of the university website.

A. Krishnappa

A. Krishnappa (10 April 1945 - 23 April 2014) was an Indian politician. In 1985, he was elected as Member of the Legislative Assembly for the Varthur Assembly Constituency in the state of Karnataka. Krishnappa was a member of the Congress Party for almost three decades. After he left it he joined the Janata Dal party. 

He contested as the Janata Dal candidate from Tumkur parliamentary constituency in the next elections and was confident of winning the seat. Being a former minister and a leader of backward classes as well, he was elected as the state president in the month of September 2013 after H D Kumaraswamy gave up his position. Mr. Krishnappa served at the Varthur constituency for almost four courses, that is twenty years in total and worked as a Minister for Animal Husbandry, Social Welfare, Horticulture, and Sugar. 

Following the polls, Mr. Deve Gowda said to press persons of The Hindu that by naming A. Krishnappa, one thing had been confirmed. It is that the Janata Dal was not a political party of father and son as it was claimed by other political critics. “This is the testimony of the party’s concern for backward classes,” as mentioned in the news reports. 

In the year 2015, The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike election for the wards within the K R Puram Assembly Constituency had transformed into a personal argument between the Congress MLA, Byrati Basavaraj, and former BJP MLA, N. S. Nandiesha Reddy. Until 2008, this constituency was a Congress stronghold that was represented by Mr. A Krishnappa. But, Nandeesh Reddy won the assembly election in 2008. The BJP won eight out of nine wards in the 2010 BBMP elections. Congress only won the Basavanapura ward in K.R.Puram. It was a time where a Congress win would accommodate Basavaraju to additionally strengthen his post and make an appearance as the new leader in Bengaluru. While for Nandeesh Reddy, a win would encourage him to recover his grip on the constituency.

In the year 2013, N. Dharam Singh, former chief minister of Karnataka, Mr. Krishnappa along with a few other corporators of K R Puram looked over and examined the hanging bridge of Krishnarajapuram that was initiated on January 26, 2003, by the former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

Mr. Krishnappa was the chairperson of the South East Asian Education Trust. He died on April 23, 2014. Mr. Krishnappa suffered a heart attack in the evening while he was playing badminton in his SEA college of Engineering at Ayyappa Nagar circle in K R Puram. News reports state that he was resting in the badminton arena around 6 in the evening during when he abruptly complained of chest pain and collapsed in the court. He was rushed to the K R Puram Super Speciality Hospital. Mr. Krishnappa’s body was brought to BVN High School in Devasandra, where he served as a committee member for more than a decade. It was kept for his supporters, companions, and other people to look at him for the last time. 

A statue and a Mahal have been built in his SEA education institution to commemorate him. It is named after him as Krishna Mahal.

Maltipoo

The maltipoo is a mix of the dog breeds Maltese and Poodle.

The Maltese are believed to have originated from the small island of Malta, located south of Sicily, Italy. Over the centuries, these dogs were loved by royalty, and were considered part of the royal family. The popularity of the Maltese grew steadily and gradually over the years, and they were finally introduced to America in the late 1800s.animalatoz.com

The Standard Poodle can be traced back to France in the 15th century. These curly-haired dogs were so popular during that time that they became known as the national breed of France. Although it took almost three centuries, poodles began to gain popularity in other countries such as Spain. During the following century, the standard poodle was bred to the size we now label toy and miniature poodles.

Although it is known that the Maltipoo is a new poodle mix, it is not very easy to find the exact place or year that this mixed breed was created. No single person or organization took credit for the first puppy of this new mix.

Many maltipoos are white, but you can find black, brown, and red maltipoos.

Maltipoos should be kept inside, they cannot be outside for too long. They should only be put outside to use the bathroom, play, or exercise.

Maltipoos should be given a bath every 3 weeks to a month. Maltipoos sheds very little to none, making it a good pet for people with allergies.

Joe Biden 2024 presidential campaign

The 2024 presidential campaign of Joe Biden was announced by Joe Biden, the 46th president of the United States. He announced his reelection campaign for the 2024 presidential election on April 25, 2023.

Biden is currently seeking the nomination for the Democratic primaries to be reelected as president.

After Biden won the 2020 United States presidential election, he became the first presidential candidate to defeat an incumbent president since the 1992 presidential election. Biden also became the oldest president ever elected in the United States.

During late 2021, as Biden was suffering from low approval ratings and nationwide polls urged Biden not to run for reelection due to his unpopularity and his age.

Biden is the oldest person to assume the office at the age of 78. He will be 82 at the end of his first term. If re-elected, he would be 86 at the end of his second term.

In November 2022, Donald Trump, who Biden had defeated in the 2020 election, announced his candidacy for a non-consecutive term. 

This later caused wide speculation that both Biden and Trump may face a potential rematch in the 2024 election. If both Biden and Trump are renominated, this would be the first presidential rematch since the 1956 presidential election.

On April 25, 2023, Biden announced his reelection campaign in a campaign ad for the 2024 election.

This officially makes Biden's fourth presidential campaign, as he ran for president in, 1988, 2008, 2020, and is running for reelection again in 2024.

Major issues such as inflation, crime, immigration, abortion rights, LGBT rights, and gun control are expected to be leading campaign topics of the 2024 election.

Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?

"Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?" is the 24th episode of "The Simpsons" 3rd season. It is the last episode of the season (the season finale). It was first broadcast on the Fox network on August 27, 1992. 

In the episode, Mr. Burns gives Homer Simpson $2,000. Homer loans the money to his homeless half-brother Herb Powell. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder. Rich Moore is the director of the episode. Danny DeVito guest stars as Herb and Joe Frazier guest stars as himself. Herb was in the episode "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" where Homer makes him bankrupt. Many fans thought that episode had a sad ending. Producers of "The Simpsons" made the episode "Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?" because of that. 

Mr. Burns learns that Homer Simpson is sterile because of his power plant's radiation. He gives Homer a fake award, $2,000, and makes him sign a wavier that does not let him sue Mr. Burns. Homer wants to buy a vibrating chair with the $2,000. His half-brother Herb Powell asks Homer to loan him the money. Herb was a car manufacturer before Homer made him bankrupt and homeless in the episode "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?". Homer goes him the money. Herb sees a baby cry and makes a machine that lets people know what babies say. Herb's machine makes him rich and successful again. Herb gives Homer the money back and gives the Simpson family gifts. Herb forgives Homer for making him bankrupt and buys him the vibrating chair Homer wanted.

"Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?" was written by John Swartzwelder. Rich Moore is the director of the episode. The episode was broadcast later in the 3rd season because the Fox network wanted producers to make another episode to be broadcast in the summer. Writers, animators, and producers had to work longer to make the episode. The idea of the vibrating chair came from one of the writers. They bought a vibrating chair to relax after working long hours of making the episode.

The reason another episode with Herb was made was that fans were sad that Herb became bankrupt in "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?". This episode was made to show Herb getting rich again. One of the producers wanted Herb to say "I have an idea!" at the end of the "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?". They instead made it into the story of this episode. Producers liked Danny DeVito as a guest star in the first episode with Herb and got him back for this episode. However, Hank Azaria said that DeVito was not as happy to guest star again. He said "The second time, Danny DeVito was like 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's get it over with.' He did a great job, but he didn't enjoy the process."

The writers of the episode had many ideas of what Herb would make to get rich again. The script of the episode had too many pages, so some parts of the episode were taken out. One of the parts that were taken out was Herb trying to get on a train to the Simpsons' town Springfield. Writers later put this idea in the season 8 episode "Burns, Baby Burns". There was going to be a joke about the Soviet Union breaking up. This was not put in the episode because the Soviet Union broke up after the episode was done being written (and it was not broadcast yet).

Joe Frazier guest stars as himself in the episode. He was in Burns' ceremony for Homer's fake award. Al Jean said that it was hard for Frazier to say the word "excellence" right. George Meyer said that Frazier said it right after 20 tries. The episode was going to show Barney Gumble beating Frazier in boxing. Frazier was a world heavyweight championship before. Frazier's son did not want that part of the episode to be shown. He said that Frazier was a world champion, "and a world champion does not get knocked out. My dad has only been knocked down twice, and that was by George Foreman." Producers wanted Foreman to be in the episode, but they could not get him in.

The episode got a Nielsen rating of 10.7. This means that the episode was seen in about 9.76 houses. It got the second best ratings of the week on the Fox network (the first being the 44th Primetime Emmy Awards).

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood (authors of "I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide") liked the episode. Parts of the episode they liked the most were Homer in the vibrating chair and Maggie using Herb's machine for babies. David Eklid from "The Guardian" said that this episode, "Lisa's Pony", and "Stark Raving Dad" make the 3rd season "pretty much the best season of any television show, ever." Nathan Ditum from "Total Film" thought that the episode referencing the movie "" was one of the best movie references of "The Simpsons".

Nate Meyers from Digitally Obsessed talked good about Herb being in another episode. Meyers said that Herb is "a perfect sibling" for Homer and said the episode has "plenty of laughs". Bill Gibron from DVD Verdict liked the jokes about the vibrating chair and thought that producers did a good job of putting Herb in another episode.

Colin Jacobson from DVD Movie Guide thought that DeVito being the voice of Herb "helps make the show more successful" and said "they really need to being him back one of these days." Tom Adair from "The Scotsman" called it a classic episode. Bill Gibron thought that DeVito was a good choice for Herb. He said that he is the opposite of how Dan Castellaneta does the voice of Homer. Nathan Ditum put DeVito on his list of the 20 best guest stars of "The Simpsons".

Kudle Beach

Kudle Beach is a natural 'C' shaped beach in Gokarna, Karnataka, India. It is considered to be one of the top 5 beaches, the northern end of which is connected to the main beach of Gokarna and the southern part, connected to Om beach. The lack of easy accessibility to the general public renders it as a neat, natural, cleaner and less crowded location to witness the sunset. There are no roads leading to Kudle beach which is further up north of Om beach, surrounded by hills on both ends. Recently, Kudle Beach had made news as it was claimed to be the birthplace of Lord Hanuman as per Valmiki Ramayana, which was asserted by head of Ramachandrapura Mutt in Shivamogga. Water sports, scuba diving and boating attract enough tourists to the beach. It is usually visited for a time period of two-three hours.

Kudle beach can be easily accessed by train and bus. There are no direct flights to Kudle. Rental services like cab can also be availed. By train, the nearest railway station is the Madgaon railway station and the biggest railway station nearby is the Ankola railway station, which is about 20 kms from the beach. The local station, Gokarna railway station is only 3 kms away from the Kudle Beach. This is a small railway station and hence not quite often travelled by. From the train station, one can reach Gokarna city by bus or auto.

Buses ply to Gokarna from all the major cities. From Mangalore and Bangalore, the buses are overnight (5–10 hours). The common point for buses coming from other station is the Shivamogga bus station from where, transport is available till Bangla Gudda.

By road, Bangalore is at a distance of 450 kms from Kudle beach, while the other main cities like Mangalore and Goa are at a distance of 235 kms and 147 kms respectively.

The nearest airport is the Daoblin airport, goa at a distance of 110 kms from the city. Bangalore and Mangalore have airports as well for traveling to Kudle beach.

The beach is famed for its natural, unpolluted water. The best time to visit is in winter from November till March when the temperature is 20-30 °C. During summers, from April- june, the temperature rises up to 40 °C and during monsoon from July to October, the place receives a considerable amount of rainfall due to which the roads leading to the beach can get slippery and slushy. The beach consists of Sahyadri rocks and an expanse of white sand. Studies show that it might be vulnerable to sea erosion is high sand dunes are not established to be stabilised by vegetation. At times, Jelly fishes are washed across the shores as well.

They were found to be in the fine sand class. The mean particle size could be fixed at 2.017-3.18. While the morphology of the beach keeps changing, this could be attributed to the seasonal variations that occur. The various heavy metals that are found in the region are rutile, kyanite, zircon, hypersthene and magnetite.

The various water sports are Kayaking that helps to move across the water, Jet skiing under a trained jet instructor in which the average power remains around 100-135 hp and Banana boat, a banana shaped boat for adult entertainment in which children are not allowed. Scuba diving, allows to get a view of the beautiful sea flowers and corals. Surfing can also be done when the waves are three to five feet tall.

There is no entrance fee, however for parking Rs.100 is taken. Everyone can visit it at any time of the day.It is advisable to visit it from 6 am till about 4 pm, after which it gets dark. Tourists visit the location for about 2–3 hours in general. There are no immediate medical facilities available near Kudle beach and as Kudle beach is in an isolated area, mobile connectivity is affected.

Diceware

Diceware is a method of creating passwords and cryptographic letters using ordinary dice as a random number generator.

Here are some examples created from diceware:

Almaz

Almaz was a space program by the military of the Soviet Union. Its purpose was to spy on other countries using space stations. After some time, the program changed to using spy satellites instead.

Since it is hard to hide a space station, the Soviets tried to keep the program a secret another way. They pretended the stations were civilian and gave them names in the Salyut series. The Salyut stations (such as Salyut 1) were normally to learn about how to live in space.

The Almaz program sent three stations to space, but the first failed. In the later years of the program, satellites were used instead since they are cheaper.

The Almaz program sent three space stations to space. These were Salyut 2, Salyut 3, and Salyut 5. These had large space telescopes to spy on other countries. The cosmonauts on the station operated these and used cameras to record what they saw.

The Salyut 3 station also had a large cannon, which was test fired once.

In 1978, Almaz began to using spy satellites instead of space stations. Four were made as part of the program. These used radar to observe the ground instead of telescopes.

The first was Almaz-T which launched on 29 October 1986. The Proton rocket in launched on failed, and was destroyed by its safety system. The next was Almaz-T2, which went to space on 25 July 1987 and stayed in space for two years. The third was Almaz-1 which launched on 3 March 1991 and stayed in space for 18 months. A fourth satellite (Almaz-2) was built but never sent to space.

The design of the Almaz space stations continues to be used even today. The Zarya module of the International Space Station is based on it. And before that, the Kvant-1 module of Mir was based on it.


São Jacinto

São Jacinto, also known as San Jacinto or Sao Jacinto, is an island at the tidal mouth of the Zuari River in the Indian state of Goa. It is one of the few islands of Goa where human settlement exists, which is located on the west coast of the Indian peninsula. 

The island is closest to the estuary's southern banks and is connected to the mainland via a bridge with a motor-able road named "Silver Gate." The island is home to an abandoned lighthouse that is passionately protected by the locals. Close to the lighthouse, on top of the São Jacinto hill, stands a rebuilt St. Dominicks Peter & Paul's Chapel which was first built in the late 50s. A church in the name of St. Hyacinth, the patron saint of the island, overlooks the waters of the river towards the east. On the last Sunday of September, the villagers hold a feast in honour of the church. 

The local residents of São Jacinto, who are a fishing community, have been living there since the Portuguese times in beautiful little houses located in the South-West of the island consisting of both native Goan and typically Portuguese Goan architecture. Earlier, there used to be a causeway that would connect São Jacinto to the mainland.

The island is home to a number of species and is considered a biodiversity hotspot, where species like the window-pane oysters, plate corals, clams, and crabs are found. The islanders, being protective, have taken the responsibility for ensuring a balance between species conservation and fishing for a livelihood. Having disallowed commercial use of the island and obstructing the advances of industrialization, San Jacinto remains a well-conserved treasure trove of nature and natural beauty.

A report on the Coastal Zone Management Plan was released in 2021 and displayed at the Chicalim village Panchayat. The report failed to show any of the approximately 200 houses on the island, also stating that it hosts a chapel that dates back to 1771 and thus should be cleared off. The people of São Jacinto were upset with the draft and took measures to reach out to relevant persons to protest the ignorance of the management. Before releasing the document, the political leadership had even assured the inhabitants that all houses on the island will be included in the draft before having it scrutinized it for final publication.

The draft further listed the island under the Port Limits of Mormugao Port Trust. The reason behind this move is feared by the locals as it could allow the islanders to be at the mercy of the MPT which may transfer the serene land to industrial lobby groups and displace the people of São Jacinto in its stead.
The villagers have refused to accept the injustice meted out to them, strongly resolving to protect their homeland at all costs.

Salyut

The Salyut program was a space program by the Soviet Union to create space stations. There were seven, single-module stations with the name Salyut that made it to orbit. An additional two stations failed during launch and were not given names starting with Salyut.

Three of these space stations were part of the Almaz series of millitary space stations, instead of the civilian Salyut program. They used the name Salyut in order to try to hide their military use.

Part of the design of the Salyut stations was later used as the basis for the core module of Mir. It was also used in the Zvezda servide module of the International Space Station. Part of the design of the Almaz stations was later used as the basis for the Kvant-1 module in Mir and the Zarya module of the International Space Station.

Moti Daman Fort

Moti Daman Fort is in the Union territory Daman and Diu, i.e. Daman. It is 112 sq.km. in size. Daman has a little more than 243,000 people. The union territories of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli have been combined into one unit. There are two forts in Daman, Moti Daman Fort and Nani Daman Fort.

The Fort formally built originally by the Mughals and later Strenghtened by the Portuguese,the Myth of the Material used by the Mughals to build the fort Stones sand and Jaggry has we say in india it does make sense since Jaggry when it is a solid state has elements of glue properties so its possible that it could well be Jaggry,

Moti Daman fort was built by the Portuguese. They began in 1559.

The Fort of Moti Daman has an area of 30,000 sq metres and still has cannons on its walls. The original colour of the wall cannot be seen because moss has grown on it. The old buildings are still intact and people use them as government offices now. People can visit the fort. There is a lighthouse inside the fort. It has a view of the Moti Daman, Nani Daman and the beach. A house where the Portuguese poet Bokage lived is near the entrance of the fort. 

Inside the fort, there are three main churches, Church of Bom Jesus, the Chapel of Our Lady of the Rosary and the Church of Our Lady of Remedies. Church of Bom Jesus is the most famous of them all. 

The Church of Bom Jesus is an example of Portuguese architecture. It was established in the year 1559 and was consecrated in 1603.

Beefalo

The beefalo is a fertile hybrid of domestic cattle ("Bos taurus"), usually a male in managed breeding programs, and the American bison ("Bison bison"), usually a female in managed breeding programs. The breed was created to combine the characteristics of both animals for beef production.

Beefalo are primarily cattle in genetics and appearance, with the breed association defining a full Beefalo as one with three-eighths (37.5%) bison genetics, while animals with higher percentages of bison genetics are called "bison hybrids".

Accidental crosses were noticed as long ago as 1749 in the Southern states, during British colonization. Cattle and bison were first intentionally crossbred during the 19th century. The first deliberate attempts to cross breed bison with cattle was made by Colonel Samuel Bedson, warden of Stoney Mountain Penitentiary, Winnipeg, in 1880. Bedson bought eight bison from a captive herd of James McKay and inter-bred them with Durham cattle. The hybrids raised by Bedson were described by naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton:

After seeing thousands of cattle die in a Kansas blizzard in 1886, Charles "Buffalo" Jones, a co-founder of Garden City, Kansas, also worked to cross bison and cattle at a ranch near the future Grand Canyon National Park, with the hope the animals could survive the harsh winters. He called the result "cattalo" in 1888. Mossom Martin Boyd of Bobcaygeon, Ontario first started the practice in Canada, publishing about some of his outcomes in the Journal of Heredity. After his death in 1914, the Canadian government continued experiments in crossbreeding up to 1964, with little success. In 1936 the Canadian government had successfully cross-bred only 30 cattalos.

It was found early on that crossing a male bison with a domestic cow would produce few offspring, but that crossing a domestic bull with a bison cow apparently solved the problem. The female offspring proved fertile, but rarely so for the males. Although the cattalo performed well, the mating problems meant the breeder had to maintain a herd of wild and difficult-to-handle bison cows.

In 1965, Jim Burnett of Montana produced a hybrid bull that was fertile. Soon after, Cory Skowronek of California formed the World Beefalo Association and began marketing the hybrids as a new breed. The new name, Beefalo, was meant to separate this hybrid from the problems associated with the old cattalo hybrids. The breed was eventually set at being genetically at least five-eighths "Bos taurus" and at most three-eighths "Bison bison".

A United States Department of Agriculture study found Beefalo meat, like bison meat, is lower in fat and cholesterol than regular beef cattle.

In 1983, the three main Beefalo registration groups reorganized under the American Beefalo World Registry. Until November 2008, there were two Beefalo associations, the American Beefalo World Registry and American Beefalo International. These organizations jointly formed the American Beefalo Association, Inc., which currently operates as the registering body for Beefalo in the United States.

Most current bison herds are genetically polluted or partly crossbred with cattle. There are only four genetically unmixed American bison herds left, and only two that are also free of brucellosis: the Wind Cave bison herd that roams Wind Cave National Park, South Dakota; and the Henry Mountains herd in the Henry Mountains of Utah. A herd on Catalina Island, California is not genetically pure or self-sustaining. Dr. Dirk Van Vuren, formerly of the University of Kansas points out that "The bison today that carry cattle DNA look exactly like bison, function exactly like bison and in fact are bison. For conservation groups, the interest is that they are not totally pure."

The term "cattalo" is defined by United States law as a cross of bison and cattle which have a bison appearance. In Canada, however, the term is used for hybrids of all degrees and appearance.

In some American states, cattalo are regulated as "exotic animals", along with pure bison and deer. However, in most states, bison and hybrids which are raised solely for livestock (meat and sale) purposes similar to cattle, are considered domestic animals like cattle, and do not require special permits.

Bowers v. Hardwick

Bowers v. Hardwick was a 1986 United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) case that said that the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution does not mean there is a constitutional right for two people of the same gender to have sex. The case was about two men, so the exact words they used were "homosexual sodomy."

The Supreme Court said that gay sex is not a deeply rooted right in American history and that it would not be possible for SCOTUS to create such a right without also creating a constitutional right to both adult incest and adultery. The majority opinion was written by Justice Byron White. The other justices who agreed were Chief Justice Warren Earl Burger and Justices Lewis Powell, William Rehnquist, and Sandra Day O'Connor. In a brief separate opinion, Chief Justice Burger said gay sex had been called bad for thousands of years, with William Blackstone calling gay sex worse than rape. The dissenting opinion came from Justices Harry Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, William Brennan, and Thurgood Marshall. They disagreed with the majority opinion. Justice Blackmun said that the 14th amendment could create a constitutional right to have sex with another person of the same gender because of the right to privacy. He said that people have a right to be left alone and that saying this about gay sex did not mean people would be legally allowed to commit adult incest or adultery.

Seventeen years later, the Supreme Court made the opposite decision. "Bowers v. Hardwick" was in the 2003 SCOTUS case "Lawrence v. Texas".

Salyut 3

Salyut 3 was a space station in the Soviet Union's Almaz program. It was also known as OTS-2 and Almaz 2. The size and shape were similar to Salyut 1, but the rest of the design was very different. This was because it was part of the Almaz program instead of the Salyut program. It was only named Salyut 3 to hide its real purpose. In reality it was a military station for spying on other countries. Most details of it were not known until after the Cold War was over.

The station had living areas for cosmonauts, engines, and solar panels. These were similar to other space stations. Due to its military nature, it also had some special equipment. There was a space telescope and several cameras, all for looking at the Earth. A small spacecraft called the Earth-return capsule stored film and could come back to Earth on its own. It was also possible for cosmonauts to develop film on the station and send back the images using a TV system. Salyut 3 also had an onboard cannon (large gun), based on a design used on aircraft.

Salyut 3 was launched into orbit on 25 June 1974 by a Proton rocket. It stayed in space for 213 days before being burned up in the atmosphere. Starting on 4 July 1974 a crew of two cosmonauts stayed at the station for two weeks. Then on 26 August 1974 a second crew arrived but could not connect to the station and so had to return to earth. After this no other crews visited, but the station could do some tasks on its own. One was sending the Earth-return capsule back. The second was firing the cannon. This is the only time a gun has been fired in space. A total of 20 rounds were fired in 3 bursts.

On 24 January 1975 the station entered the atmosphere and burned up. It was followed by Salyut 4 which was a civilian space station. The next Almaz station was Salyut 5.

The Embassy of the United Kingdom, Berlin () is the United Kingdom's diplomatic mission to Germany. It is located on 70-71 Wilhelmstraße, near the Hotel Adlon, in Berlin. In October 2021, the ambassador is Jill Gallard.

Before moving to the current location of the embassy, the embassy could be found used Building Leipziger Platz 12, the Dutch Palace and other places from 1797 to 1803. The original building at 70 Wilhelmstraße, known as the Palais Strousberg and designed by August Orth, was finished being created in 1868 by the railway businessman Bethel Henry Strousberg. The United Kingdom would officially buy the place in December 1884, as they were previously just renting it for use as the embassy.

After World War 1 started and relations with the United Kingdom and Germany started being bad, the building would become empty. It would only be in 1920 that the United Kingdom would start to use it again, as the war had ended. However, the building would return to being empty after World War 2 started, as United Kingdom-Germany relations became bad again. After allied bombing on Germany, the building would become very damaged. After the end of the war, it was decided that the building would be completely destroyed in 1950. The United Kingdom still owned the land though.

All I know is that pornography made my living hell ... worse." Smart was also in a video made by Fight the New Drug, and continues to talk about the dangers of pornography.

YouTuber Chaz Smith has been a supporter of Fight the New Drug. Smith's May 2018 YouTube video, "What Was He Looking At?", shares statistics related to porn viewing and how it affects people.

Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends (video game)

Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends is a video game developed and published by Crave Entertainment and released for the Game Boy Advance line of handhelds on October 17, 2006. The game is based on the animated series with the same name.

The player controls Mac or Bloo. Both characters can throw paper balls, and you barely have to do that. Mostly you spend time collecting items to complete objectives. There are also three boss battles with Terrence, who mostly fires his slingshot and is accompinied by another enemy in the second and third battles. Mac and Bloo both have different abilities. Mac can slingshot paper balls (but only after the first fight with Terrence), double-jump to reach higher platforms, and duck to avoid flying objects. Bloo can roll his body into a ball to get into narrow spaces. Both of them have the abilities to slide down banisters, launch paper balls, talk to non-playable characters, and hide from enemies. Talking can give you an advantage. For example, every time the player would need to get up to a higher place that Mac can't double-jump to, if Wilt is around, talking to him will get him to lift the player up. Sometimes, you have to make it past enemies. Bendy is the most common enemy. He throws things down from above. Hitting him with a paper ball will make him cry and stop doing things for a short amount of time. Getting hit by an enemy will deplete the player's health, which is a row of three candies. Every time you get hit, you lose a candy, but you could collect more to replenish them. Dying will cause you to come from the door you last entered. The game has three minigames which can be unlocked by collecting Game-Hive tickets. When the player enters a door they might switch characters. The player is not in control of who they are using. Every time he or she enters a door, there is a chance of characters switching. In the final battle with Terrence and Duchess, the player can change between Mac and Bloo at any time.

This causes Rex to lose some of his builds. He reports this happening to Providence and is sent to the Amazon jungle on another mission from Providence.

A massive group of EVOs is migrating through the Amazon to Dr. Rylander's lab, where Rex copies Rylander's data, learning that the piece Breach stole is part of a Omega-1 Nanite blueprint. He is then quickly attacked by the Rabbit EVO, whom he later defeats. Breach steals a blueprint piece again as Rex returns to Providence.

Afterwards, Rex goes to Hong Kong with Bobo Haha to stop Quarry from stealing items from a bank, including a piece of the blueprint. To Rex's interest here they encounter his love, Circe. He finds out that she is working for Van Kleiss again, as he helped her escape from him. Rex is ambushed by Breach and he and Bobo are separated. Later, Rex stops Quarry but he is knocked into a river, unable to get the blueprint.

Rex leaves Hong Kong right when Quarry gets out of the river and gives Circe the blueprint. It is later revealed that Circe is only helping Van Kleiss so that she can become a normal girl again. Back at Providence, Rex's brother, Caesar Salazar, tells Rex that Van Kleiss can never make another Omega-1 Nanite because he has a quarter of the blueprint memorized in his mind.

Suddenly Doctor Holiday is attacked and is taken into the Petting Zoo. Once she is safe, Rex goes to the landing platform to save Caesar but Van Kleiss manages to kidnap him. Rex later sets out to find the rest of the blueprints, going to Aquania and discovering that the entire area has turned into an EVO and is trying to kill him.

Rex then confronts Breach and makes her open a portal back to the real world by destroying her toys, escaping with the Aquania blueprint. Rex goes to Abysus to find Caesar and bring him back.

Epididymectomy

An epididymectomy is a male sterilization surgery that removes the epididymis, or the tube in the scrotum where the sperm become able to move. An epididymectomy can be done on either one side or both sides of the scrotum. It does not always make the male animal sterile forever, because the tubing can grow back later. It is performed on animals such as bulls. It is sometimes done on human men if the men have pain after vasectomy, a tumor, or a cyst that is difficult to treat.


Vasectomy

A vasectomy is a male sterilization surgery that involves snipping the vas deferens, which is the reproductive tube that carries sperm from a male's epididymis all of the way to this man's prostate.

The Lion King: Simba's Mighty Adventure

Disney's The Lion King: Simba's Mighty Adventure is a video game based on the Walt Disney Feature Animation film, "The Lion King" and the DVD only sequel, "", came out on PlayStation and Game Boy Color December 22, 2000. Unlike the older "The Lion King" video game, it was more like the film and the storyline carried on into "The Lion King II: Simba's Pride". The bosses Simba faces in this game are Scar and Zira.

The game's gameplay varied between the two consoles.

Due to the PlayStation console's 3D graphics, the gameplay became slightly more varied. Simba's capabilities are identical to the first "The Lion King" video game in which he can growl, leap, roll and run.

The game is mostly a side-scrolling platformer with occasional levels where the camera is top-down. The gameplay is very similar to the first "The Lion King" video game, in which the player takes control of Simba and must leap and run between platforms while fighting enemies and avoiding pitfalls. During levels Simba can collect pawprint-shaped tokens which add to the overall score.


In the PlayStation version, voices, music and sound effects from the film were used. Clips from the film are placed between levels although many of the lines were redubbed by other Lion King related actors, including but not limited to Cam Clarke, Shaun Fleming, Vanessa Marshall, Jim Cummings, and Kevin Schon.

In the Game Boy Color version of the game there was only one piece of music used on every level. Some of the animation for both adult Simba and cub Simba was recycled from the previous "The Lion King" video game.

The PlayStation release of the game generally received negative reviews as it was criticized for being too short and for the repetitive level designs.

Cartoon Network Racing

Cartoon Network Racing is a racing video game developed by Eutechnyx for PlayStation 2 and Firebrand Games for Nintendo DS, published by Danish video game developer The Game Factory, and released on December 4, 2006, in North America, and on February 9, 2007, in Europe. The gameplay is similar to Nintendo's 2003 game "", but the characters and racetracks are all from Cartoon Network's original animated television series. The six animated television series that are featured in the game, in alphabetical order, are "Courage the Cowardly Dog", "Cow and Chicken", "Dexter's Laboratory", "I Am Weasel", "Johnny Bravo", and "The Powerpuff Girls".

There are two characters the player must choose: a driver, who drives a go-kart, and a co-driver, who uses all weapons and has two "toon powers". There are tournaments which players must race a series of races and win with the most points. Battle modes in arenas let two teams battle in different modes, and Cartoon Eliminators are endurance races where last kart in each lap is eliminated. The karts have three stats: acceleration, speed, and handling (if chosen as driver). If co-driver, they have two toon powers that fall into four categories: Shield, Attack, Boost and Flight.

All 20 characters in the DS version get their own kart (the Powerpuff Girls have separate karts, unlike the PS2 version). Each character's toon power can be used when their toon power bar is full. There are 1-8 players available in this version. Unlike the PlayStation 2 version, there are two mini-games and three cartoons.

A gallery in the PlayStation 2 version contains two cartoons from each show. The first cartoon is unlocked by completing each cartoon-themed tournament while the other is unlocked by winning the super tournament with the driver of the series the player wants to unlock.

The DS version received "mixed" reviews, while the PlayStation 2 version received "generally unfavorable reviews" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

Lucas M. Thomas of IGN criticized the DS version for its similarities to the Mario Kart series, especially "Mario Kart DS", as well as for having no characters from other Cartoon Network shows that were airing new episodes at the time such as "Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends", "Camp Lazlo", "The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy", "", and "My Gym Partner's a Monkey". GameSpot's Aaron Thomas pointed out the same version's resemblance to "Mario Kart", but he explained that a younger audience would find the game more enjoyable than an audience of serious gamers would.

It was released for the GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2, and is based on the American animated television series "", which aired from 2002 to 2008 on Cartoon Network.

One day, the KND are playing a videogame. While Numbuh 2 gives Numbuh 1 a training simulation helmet, which according to Numbuh 2 "a numbuh one size fits all." Then, the Toilenator shows up and ties up the rest of the team, while Numbuh 1 thinks this is a simulation, not the real thing. So after he defeats the "simulated" Toilenator, he decides to throw him out the window, which he also thinks is simulated. After Numbuh 1 frees the team, and they inform him that the Toilenator is, in fact real, Numbuh 86 reports. The most dangerous villains the KND has fought have escaped from the maximum security prison at the KND Arctic Base. Numbuh 86 states that while she will normally get the other KND sectors to help out they are all at the beach and so Sector V is tasked with recapturing the villains and taking them to their even more maximum security prison on the dark side of the moon. She also mentions that Gramma Stuffum has taken over the Sprinkle Puff Donut Shoppe and is filling the donuts with liver and spinach creme Numbuh 1 has decided to go after Gramma Stuffum and assigns Numbuhs 2, 3, and 5 to track down the other villains while leaving Numbuh 4 to guard the Treehouse (a role in which with he is not happy). Numbuh 1 makes his way through the Sprinkle Puff Donut Shoppe through a giant oven, a giant fan, a river of dough, and finally confronting Gramma Stuffum and her Chuck Wagon in her lair. After he defeats Gramma Stuffum Numbuh 1 gets a call from Numbuh 4 (who really needs the toilet) informing him that the KND Treehouse is covered in snot. Numbuh 1 is convinced that all the snot means the Common Cold has invaded the treehouse. He informs all of Sector V that the treehouse is under attack and Numbuh 5 heads back to stop him meanwhile a mysterious person steals the engine core from the Chuck Wagon.

Arriving back at the treehouse Numbuh 5 finds out that the Common Cold has infected the Treehouse Security System And turns the defences against her so Numbuh 5 is tasked to get through the snot infested Treehouse to try and turn off the Treehouse Security System, defeat the Flu Bugs and W.A.T.C.H.B.O.T.S and free Numbuh 4.

After Numbuh 5 achieves this, the Common Cold introduces his Snot Bomber, which happens to be floating outside the treehouse. Numbuh 2 appears piloting the KND C.O.O.L.B.U.S, which he uses to chase the Common Cold through the countryside, city and finally confronting the Snot Bomber at the beach. Afterwards the same mysterious person appears in a jetpack and takes the power core from the Snot Bomber, causing it to plummet to the ground, but Numbuh 2 doesn't notice this because he is trying to pick up the phone he dropped.

While Numbuh 4 is at ‘the toilet we never use’ (as all the other toilets are still full of snot and he has been holding it in since the Common Cold captured him), the power goes out and one-by-one, Count Spankulot has turned the KND (excluding Numbuh 4) into spank-happy vampires.

Once Numbuh 4 finds out about his teammates, he travels through the treehouse to find and defeat them.

Once all the KND are back to normal, they have decided their next course of action will be catching all the hamsters to repower the treehouse (as Count Spankulot has released them while Numbuh 4 is fighting the other KND members). Unfortunately chasing the hamsters tires them out, except for Numbuh 3, who thinks this as a game. So Numbuh 3 is assigned to catch all the hamsters throughout the treehouse and restart the power core.

Once Numbuh 3 powers up the treehouse, Numbuh 1 has decided to strike back at Count Spankulot. Numbuh 1 heads out and browses the neighborhood to free children, defeat Count Spankulot's minions, and to confront Count Spankulot at the School Clocktower among a barrage of enemies.

After Count Spankulot's defeat, Numbuh 86 reports again. He states that while the KND are fighting Count Spankulot, Sector P has spotted Stickybeard and the Sweet Revenge off the coast of South Dakota. But their plan of using Numbuh 2's T.A.R.P.O.O.N to anchor a rope so Numbuh 5 may board the Sweet Revenge and capture Stickybeard has to be adjusted because of Numbuh 4's curiosity of pressing buttons resulted in the T.A.R.P.O.O.N being fired at the Treehouse instead of the Sweet Revenge so they make a plan to make a new T.A.R.P.O.O.N by collecting all the parts from the boats of Stickybeard's henchmen.

Once the new T.A.R.P.O.O.N. is built, Numbuh 2 fires it at the Sweet Revenge and Numbuh 5 slid along the T.A.R.P.O.O.N. rope to the ship.

Numbuh 5 then makes her way through the ship, defeating all of the pirates until she confronted Stickybeard in his candy treasury room. After Numbuh 5 defeats Stickybeard the mysterious person is revealed to be Numbuh 5's older sister Cree, who while once used to be a KND operative now works for the Delightful Children From Down the Lane and Father, then after she traps Numbuh 5 under Stickybeard she takes his candy cane peg leg and leaves.

Later that night, Numbuh 86 informs Sector V that Knightbrace is collecting fireflies for 'Bug Brite' glow in the dark toothpaste. Knowing Knightbrace has to be stopped (and the fact she adores fireflies). Numbuh 3 volunteers to browse the neighborhood for fireflies after finding and befriending one of the fireflies (and using her surprising knowledge of firefly speak) she convinces the firefly and any other fireflies that Knightbrace has not captured to help her burn through the garden fences to where the fireflies are being held captive, the School Clocktower. From here, Numbuh 3 uses the fireflies not being held captive to burn the jar lids open. This leaves a glow from the tower once the fireflies leave.

The fireflies grateful at being freed help the KND find the location of Knightbrace's Cavity Cave, from where Numbuh 1 will find the passcodes to open the path to Knightbrace's lair. Once here, Numbuh 1 crosses a river of pure fluoride and gets to a Dentadrone spawner to short circuit the entrance to Knightbrace's lair. Once in the lair, Numbuh 1 finds Knightbrace in his Dental Assault Chair.

After Numbuh 1 defeats Knightbrace, Numbuh 4 finds the Toilenator trying to flood the Treehouse with sewage (as he has tried to do at the beginning of the game). Numbuh 4 makes his way through the flooding treehouse, defeating the Toilenator's new henchmen, Scrummy Mummies and Poohemoths, to his room. Numbuh 4 challenges the Toilenator to a race to Numbuh 4's toilet. When Numbuh 4 wins, the Toilenator is sent to the C.O.O.L.B.U.S with the other villains.

The KND begin to take off after they have checked the villains. Since they are all there, the KND blast off for the moon in the C.O.O.L.B.U.S. While they're up there, Numbuh 2 mistakes the DCFDTL's Mega-Mansion for the Moon. The KND defeat all the Assault Satilities and the DCFDTL's Mega-Mansion.

But no sooner have the KND done this, the DCFDTL's Mega-Mansion sends out a beam which merges the villains. With the amalgamation bearing down on them Sector V And Numbuh 86 activate the T.R.E.E.H.E.M.O.T.H. After the amalgamation is defeated an explosion destroys the amalgamation and sends the villains flying. Later at the Moon Base Sector V is given celebratory medals by Numbuh 86 then the credits roll. It's later discovered that the adventure is just Sector V playing the game as Numbuh 3 celebrates that they've finished the game and Numbuhs 2 and 5 discussing special moves for the game (with Numbuh 4 complaining that for the last time, sneaking is not a special move) Numbuh 1 reminds Sector V that the video game is in fact an important training exercise. However, the Toilenator then arrives at the Treehouse just like in the beginning suggest the events in the game are going to repeat themselves in reality.

The game received generally mixed ratings, with the Gamecube version having overall better reception than the PS2 or Xbox versions. IGN rated it poorly, 4.0 out of 10, criticizing its bad camera angles and unreliable controls.


Balmuri Falls

Balmuri Falls is a small water body that runs through Srirangapatna, Karnataka. The cascading water is a man-made waterfall over a dam. The Cauvery River flows through, with lush greenery and tall coconut trees surrounding it. 
The falls act as a tourist attraction but also continues to run along areas such as It is a car ride away from the city of Mysore and a mid-point for those traveling from Bangalore to enjoy its scenic views. Balmuri Falls is around 16.5 kilometres away from the Mysore and 138 kilometres away from Bangalore. Not only can one experience these falls but they can also visit Edmuri Falls, that flows a few kilometres away.

Its name is derived from the local language, Kannada and is named so due to the direction that river flows in. ‘Bala’ in the state’s language means, ‘Right’ while ‘Muri’ is ‘Turn.’ As the river flows slightly in a right direction, the dam thus, got its name. 

The dam was constructed in attempts to hold water of the Cauvery River. It was mainly built to help and control irrigation of the fields surrounding the river. Once it fills up, river water falls down a length of 6 to 7 feet from over the dam wall. The length of the dam approximately 1.6 km and drops off into the flow of mini waterfall due to a descent of 6 feet. 

The waterfall is open throughout the year for tourists but, it is most enjoyable from March to August. The summer time is apt to go for a dip or swim the Balmuri’s waters. The water levels are also relatively low during these months, making it safe to take a walk or play in it. Winter months can be pleasant to visit as well.

Visitors can choose this spot as a destination for picnics and leisurely strolls. There are also facilities for seasonal boat rides at the water cascade, when water levels are high enough. Along with this there are food stalls from which visitors can buy fresh food from. 

There are many other tourist attractions that can be visited near and around the vicinity, including this vast sanctuary. Being the largest of its kind in the state, it holds ground to many exotic, migrant and native birds. Is located 10 kilometres away from the falls and stretches across 40 acres of land. 

These gardens are known to be Mysore city’s greatest attraction. The vicinity also has the Krishna Raja Sagara Dam (KRS) built on the Cauvery river. Brindavan Gardens stretches over 60 acres and is located 8 kilometres away from Balmuri Falls.

This tourist attraction is also near Balamuri Falls and is known to be the summer palace of Tipu Sultan, a king from the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is filled with history that visitors can experience, first hand. It stands 14 kilometres away from Balmuri Falls.

Though the falls have become a great tourist attraction, 48 deaths have been reported since 2008. Many of the youth from different districts in Karnataka have visited, some drowning to death. The depth of the water during the Monsoon season has been difficult to measure, causing many to drown. This has been caused due to numerous whirlpools that have acted as “death traps.” Authorities have reported many of the fatalities to be men under the influence of alcohol found at nearby shops. 
At certain periods of time, authorities have had to close down access to the falls due to opening of the Krishnaraja Sagar Dam (KRS). This dam holds most of the water flowing through the river Cauvery which surpasses dangerous levels that tourists can handle.

2020 Karnataka Floods

The South Indian state of Karnataka experienced heavy floods on 18 August 2020 continuing till late October due to heavy rainfall. This was added trouble to the existing problem of pandemic caused by the virus, COVID19. Even before flood hit the areas, the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Management Centre predicted floods in the month of June itself, basing the observation on destruction caused in 2019 floods of the state. The flood fury was seen in 23 districts of the state, out of which the Malenadu region and all the districts of Coastal Karnataka were declared in flood zones. The districts like Belagavi, Kalburgi, Raichur and Bagalkot in northern part of the state received rainfall almost touching the highest of 21cms, which in normal conditions is as low as, below 10cms.  The Malenadu regions like Bhagamandala, Aiyamageri received 647mm of rainfall on an average in the year 2020.

Apart from increased downpour in the state,  many different reasons have been reported regionally. The capital of the state, Bengaluru is known to have more rainfall on an average, but in the last decade flood instances have cropped up time and again, it is attributed to amplified urbanisation causing stress on the natural resources, encroachment of flood plains, loss of vegetation and biodiversity, improper city planning leading to reckless constructions of sites and buildings. Along with these reasons, change in the river course of movement, deforestation and land modifications to accommodate tourists have been  the reasons for recurring floods and landslides in Malenadu region of the state. In northern Karnataka, heavy discharge of water from the Dams in Maharashtra and Karnataka, also aggravated the situation. Release of water from Ujjani Dam built on the river Bhima in Maharashtra rooted for flooding of 400 villages in Vijaypura, Kalburgi and Yadgir district.

Twenty flood relief and ten Engineering Task force from Madras Engineering Group, Maratha Light Infantry Centre and Bison Division from Hyderabad were also employed to provide assistance in Yadgir, Gadag districts. More than two thousand crore rupees from State Relief Natural Disaster Fund was demanded for rebuilding houses, reestablishment of the lost livestock and creation of jobs.

Holstein Friesian

Holstein Friesians are a breed of cattle originating from the North Holland and Friesland provinces of the Netherlands, and also the Schleswig-Holtstein state in northern Germany. Like other cattle, they are used as livestock for dairy and beef.

The breed weighs about 600 to 750 kg. A newborn calf weighs about 40 to 45 kg (sometimes even more). The breed is about about 1.45 m high. It can produce up to about 8,000 kg of milk per year (10,000 to 16,000 kg / year in top animals). It's milk is 4.2% fat and 3.4% egg white per liter (at high milk production the percentages may be slightly lower).

The Holstein Friesian could have originated after Frisian and Batavian cows were bred with each other, about 2000 years ago. Over the centuries, the cow is being used as a dairy breed. The breed was also popular abroad in the 19th century because of its high milk production. In the United States, Dutch cows were further bred. These cows were named Holstein-Friesian (the Holsteiners were introduced by German emigrants in the 17th century). In the second half of the 20th century, the descendants of the Dutch cows were cited in the Netherlands, because they produced more milk than the Dutch breeds Meuse-Rhine-Issel and Frisian-Holland. Since then, the black-colored Holstein-Friesian has been by far the most important cow breed in the Netherlands.

Pininfarina

Pininfarina S.p.A. (short for Carrozzeria Pininfarina) is an Italian car design firm and coachbuilder, with headquarters in Cambiano, Turin, Italy. It was founded by Battista "Pinin" Farina in 1930. On 14 December 2015, Mahindra Group acquired Pininfarina S.p.A. for about €168 million.

Pininfarina is employed by a wide variety of automobile manufacturers to design vehicles. These firms have included long-established customers such as Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Peugeot, Fiat, GM, Lancia, and Maserati, to emerging companies in the Asian market with Chinese manufactures like AviChina, Chery, Changfeng, Brilliance, JAC and VinFast in Vietnam and Korean manufacturers Daewoo and Hyundai.

When automobile designer and builder Battista "Pinin" Farina broke away from his brother's coach building firm, Stabilimenti Farina, in 1928, he founded "Carrozzeria Pinin Farina" with financial help from his wife's family and Vincenzo Lancia. That first year the firm employed eighteen and built 50 automobile bodies.

After the war, Italy was banned from the 1946 Paris Motor Show. The Paris show was attended by 809,000 visitors (twice the pre-war figure), queues stretched from the main gate all the way to the Seine. Pinin Farina and his son Sergio, determined to defy the ban, drove two of their cars (an Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 S and a Lancia Aprilia cabriolet) from Turin to Paris, and found a place at the entrance to the exhibition to display the two new creations. The managers of the Grand Palais said of the display, "the devil Pinin Farina", but to the press and the public it was the successful "Turin coachbuilder's anti-salon".

It started in 1951 with a meeting at a restaurant in Tortona, a small town halfway between Turin and Modena. This neutral territory was chosen because neither Farina nor Enzo Ferrari wanted to meet at the other's headquarters. Battista’s son, Sergio Pininfarina recalled, "It is not difficult to imagine how I felt that afternoon when my father, without taking his eyes off the road for one moment told me his decision as we drove back to Turin: "From now on you'll be looking after the Ferrari, from A to Z. Design, engineering, technology, construction—the lot!"—I was over the moon with happiness."

From 1954 to 1955 Pinin Farina purchased land in Grugliasco, outside of Turin, for a new factory. "The factory in no way would look like the one of Corso Trapani. It would be a car no longer on my measurements but on those of my children, built looking like them; I had this in mind and wanted it," said Farina.

Starting with the planning for the new plant in Grugliasco in 1956, Farina started to groom his replacements–Sergio his son and Renzo Carli his son-in-law. To his heirs apparent, Farina said of the Corso Trapani facility "This old plant has reached the limits of its growth. It has no room for expansion and is far from being up to date. If I were alone I'd leave it as it is. But I want you to decide which way to go–to stay as we are or to enlarge. Either way is fine with me. It's your decision to make and I don't want to know what it is. I'm finished and it's your time to take over. The future is absolutely up to you." In 1958, upon leaving for a world tour Farina added, "In my family, we inherit our legacies from live people–not from the dead."

In 1961 at the age of 68, “Pinin” Farina formally turned his firm over to his son Sergio and his son-in-law, Renzo Carli, it was the same year that the President of Italy formally authorized the change of Farina’s last name to Pininfarina and the business took on the same name.

Pininfarina was run by Battista's grandson Andrea Pininfarina from 2001 until his death in 2008. Andrea's younger brother Paolo Pininfarina was then appointed as successor.

Great Soviet Encyclopedia

The Great Soviet Encyclopedia is one of the largest Russian-language encyclopedias, submitted in the Soviet Union from 1926 to 1990. After 2002, the encyclopedia's information was partially added into the later "Great Russian Encyclopedia" in an updated and changed form. The GSE said to be "the first Marxist–Leninist general-purpose encyclopedia".

The idea of the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia came" in 1923 on the idea of Otto Schmidt, a member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union (today, the "Russian Academy of Sciences"). In early 1924 Schmidt worked with a group which had Mikhail Pokrovsky, (rector of the Institute of Red Professors), Nikolai Meshcheryakov (Former head of the Glavit, the State Administration of Publishing Affairs), Valery Bryusov (poet), Veniamin Kagan (mathematician) and Konstantin Kuzminsky to draw up a proposal which was chosen in April 1924. Also involved was Anatoly Lunacharsky.

Contributors to the GSE are in this list.

The third version was translated and submitted into English in 31 books between 1974 and 1983 by Macmillan Publishers. Each book was translated separately, making use of the index found at the front of each book to locate specific items; knowledge of Russian can be helpful to find the right book the first time. Not all versions were translated into English; these are indicated in the index. Articles from the English version are made available online by TheFreeDictionary.com.

The third version was translated into Greek and submitted in 34 books between 1977 and 1983 from Akadimos publishing company (owned by Giannis Giannikos), which has also translated various Soviet encyclopedias and literature. All articles that were related to Greece or Greek history, culture and society were expanded and hundreds of new ones were written especially for the Greek version. The encyclopedia contains, for example, both the Russian entry on Greece as well as a much larger one prepared by Greek contributors. Each article written especially in the Greek version is marked with the note "Greek version supplement" (or "Συμπλήρωμα ελληνικής έκδοσης" as written in the Greek translation).

Finally, a supplementary book covering the 1980s was submitted in 1989. It contains translated and original Greek articles which, sometimes, do not exist in the 34-book set. The articles of the Greek version are being gradually made digital now; the digital books can be found on "vivlio2ebook" blog, which is dedicated on digital various books in Greek language.

Publication of the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia" was suspended in 1990 and halted in 1991, but in 2002 it was reinstituted by decree of Vladimir Putin. In 2003 and 2004 a team of editors overhauled the old encyclopedia by updating facts, removing most examples of overt political bias, and changing its name to the "Great Russian Encyclopedia". Many outdated articles are being entirely rewritten. In 2004 the first book of the newly overhauled "Great Russian Encyclopedia" was submitted. The complete version of 35 books was released by 2017.

Publication of the "Great Russian Encyclopedia" is overseen by the Russian Academy of Sciences, and funded by the Government of the Russian Federation. The encyclopedia is now found in libraries and schools throughout the CIS. Additionally, the 1980s versions remain in widespread use, particularly as references in scientific and mathematical research.

Yemalur Main Road

Yemalur Main Road begins at Borewell Crossing at HAL Old Airport Road in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It runs behind the HAL Airport and meets with Wind Tunnel Road that connects to Murugesh Palya further West on Old Airport Road.

Yemalur Main Road falls under the Marathahalli Ward and C.V. Raman Nagar assembly constituency. The MLA (Member of the Legislative Assembly) of the constituency is S. Raghu. It falls under the Bangalore Central parliamentary constituency. The MP (member of Parliament) of the constituency is P.C. Mohan.

Yemalur Main Road begins on Old Airport Road from the Borewell Crossing. The road follows the length of the rear wall of the HAL Flight Testing Centre (HAL Airport) up until a narrow, kuccha pathway through Kempapura, which eventually opens out into Wind Tunnel Road. Its coordinates are from 12.955214, 77.689368 to 12.946359, 77.670829.

The pincode of Yemalur Main Road is Bangalore 560037. It lies in the Bangalore South taluk, and Bangalore East postal division.

A wide turning on Yemalur Main Road leads to the Bellandur Lake, defining the limits of Yemalur Village between the Bellandur lake and HAL airport.

The neighbourhood of Yemalur Main Road is a mixture of various economic classes of people. Where there are several high-rise apartments and villaments, there are also single-room apartments lining the road. The following is a list of apartments (along with villaments) on Yemalur Main Road (in the order that they appear starting at Borewell Crossing to the end of the road which meets at Wind Tunnel Road).

There is an important tech park at Yemalur Main Road called Divyasree Technopolis. This technopolis houses the offices of CGI Inc, Fujitsu, Thomson Reuters, Aditya Birla Group, Deloitte and Landmark Group.

There are several small temples that one may visit in the Yemalur area. These include Ranganatha Temple, Ganesha Temple, Basavanna Temple, Mulakantamma Temple and Shani Temple.

Another notable place close to Yemalur Main Road is Yemalur Bridge. It was constructed at the boundary of Yemalur Village to connect it to Bellandur Lake Road after there were complaints that the lake flooded into homes in Yemalur after heavy rainfall. This bridge paves the way between Bellandur and the offices at tech parks at Yemalur Main Road.

The schools in the Yemalur Main Road area are mostly primary schools, except for Neev Academy (which has classes up to high school). Neev Academy is located 550 metres away from Yemalur Bridge.

The primary schools in this area are as follows.

Yemalur Main Road has links to several locations in india.

Marathahalli lies to the East of Yemalur Main Road. 500 metres into the road, there is a kuccha road or walkway to go to Marathahalli market. You cannot drive through this path, only walk or cycle.

Yemalur Main Road gets its name from being the road that takes you from HAL Old Airport Road to Yemalur Village.

The NAL Wind Tunnel Road begins where Yemalur Main Road ends. It provides a link between Yemalur and Bellandur to Murugesh Palya, Old Airport Road.

A wide turning on Yemalur Main Road will take you straight to Bellandur Lake Road. This lake is commonly known as Snowfall Lake. This is because the pollution in the lake creates a stinky, white foam. This foam has even caught fire a few times.

The Bellandur Lake Road starting in Yemalur is the way towards Bellandur. This will take you the Bellandur Main Road, which eventually leads out to the Outer Ring Road.

The HAL Flight Testing Centre or HAL Airport runs adjacent to the Yemalur Main Road. Residents of this road are prone to hearing the loud noise created by the aircrafts while they take off and land. The noise has increased as of December 2020 because the Flight Testing Centre was made an airport for chartered aircrafts.

Kempapura is the area between the end of Yemalur Main Road and the beginning of Wind Tunnel Road.

Ambedkar Nagar falls directly after Kempapura towards the direction of the East.

One of the main problems in homes and workplaces in and around Yemalur Main Road include the stench which comes from Bellandur Lake. The foam is another issue which causes major grievance to the residents in the area. This is accompanied with the flooding of several homes in Yemalur Village and neighbouring areas by Bellandur Lake. This often used to happen after heavy rains.

Another problem that residents of Yemalur Main Road and Yemalur Village have is the road problem. The narrow connecting street between Yemalur Main Road and Wind Tunnel Road is a 300 metre stretch which is terrible quality and has potholes all over it. This road is the official property of HAL Bengaluru, so the fixing of potholes is the responsibility of HAL. Due to lack of funds, this road has not been repaired.

Hatha Coco Nest is an upcoming apartment building in the Yemalur Main Road area. Possession of flats in this apartment will begin in June 2021. Other recent constructions in the area include Sai Smaran Sai Garden, Prestige Kew Gardens, Rohan Jharoka II Apartments, R.S. Green View Apartments and Sai Johith Homes.

King Charles Spaniel

The King Charles Spaniel (also called the English Toy Spaniel, especially in the United States) is a small dog breed of the spaniel type. 

In 1903, the Kennel Club in the United Kingdom combined four small spaniel breeds into a single breed of dog and called it the King Charles Spaniel. The other breeds merged into this breed were the Blenheim, Ruby and Prince Charles Spaniels. Originally from East Asia, toy spaniels were first seen in Europe during the 16th century. They were often seen with English royalty and were made famous by their association with King Charles II. They are very closely related to the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the two were considered the same breed until 1945 when the Kennel Club divided them into two seperate breeds. This breed has a smaller skull and shorter nose than the Cavalier.

These dogs come with four different types of coats (which came from the four breeds that contributed to making this breed):

Usually very contented but can get excited when around children. Unlike most of the other spaniel breeds, the King Charles does not require much exercise and will be quite happy with just a short stroll every day.

The Inquiry

The Inquiry was a study group that U.S. President Woodrow Wilson created to help him decide what the post-World War I peace should look like. The Inquiry made various suggestions about this topic, some of which were adopted and some of which weren't adopted. Some members of the Inquiry ended up creating the Council on Foreign Relations (which is independent from the U.S. government) later on.

The Inquiry said that the German Empire should give Alsace-Lorraine back to France, that France should get the parts of the Saarland that it controlled before 1815, that the Rhineland should be demilitarized, that Belgium stop being neutral, that Belgium should get some territory in the Maastricht and Malmedy regions, that Luxembourg should either be annexed to Belgium or have its independence brought back, and that there should be a vote in northern Schleswig to decide whether it will stay with the German Empire or rejoin Denmark. The Inquiry also said that if Russia could become a real democratic federation, then the Baltic states (other than Lithuania) and Ukraine should reunite with Russia since this would be in the best economic interests of everyone. The Inquiry also said that if the Bolsheviks will keep control of Russia, then the independence of both the Baltic states and Ukraine would have to be recognized on the condition that there would be a vote in these territories on a future reunion with Russia once Russia will stop being ruled by Bolsheviks. The Inquiry's proposed borders for Latvia, Estonia, and Ukraine were very similar to the borders that these countries had after 1991 in real life, with the Inquiry even saying that Ukraine should get Crimea. The Inquiry also said that Finland should be given its independence, that the Aland Islands should be given to Sweden, that an independent Poland be created along with a Polish Corridor so that it could have secure access to the Baltic Sea, that Poland and Lithuania should reunite, and that the door should be kept open for Poland to get both eastern Galicia and the Belarusian-majority territories to its north. The Inquiry said that Wilsonian Armenia should get independence and also that both Georgia (country) and Azerbaijan should get provisional independence, with the Inquiry having a favorable view of the idea of a future union between Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan.

The Inquiry said that Czechoslovakia should be created in roughly the same borders that it was created in real life, with a combined Czech and Slovak majority but also with sizable German, Hungarian, and Ukrainian (Ruthenian) ethnic minorities. Similarly, the Inquiry's advice for Romanian expansion (into Transylvania, Bukovina, the eastern Banat, et cetera) and the creation of Yugoslavia were also followed. The Inquiry also said that Italy should get a northern border slightly to the south of the Brenner Pass in order to reduce the number of Germans who would end up under Italian rule without weakening Italy's security; this advice was not followed since Italy got the Brenner Pass border. The Inquiry also said that Italy should annex Istria but not Fiume due to the latter's importance for Yugoslavia but in spite of this, Italy ultimately ended up annexing both of these territories. The Inquiry said that both German Austria and Hungary should acquire and keep their independence and that Austria should not reunify with Germany–at least not yet. Also, the Inquiry said that Hungary should keep the Burgenland until it actually becomes clear that its people actually want to join German Austria.

The Inquiry gave no advice for Albania due to the complexity of the situation there. However, it did say that Constantinople should be made into an international state, that an independent Turkish state to be created in Anatolia under a League of Nations mandate, that independent Mesopotamian and Greater Syrian states should be created under League of Nations mandates, and that the option of an Arab confederation that includes both Mesopotamia and Syria should be kept option for the future. The Inquiry said that an independent Palestinian state under a British mandate should be created in Palestine that would also be a Jewish national homeland where Jews would be free to settle and would have their rights and freedoms respected. The Inquiry kept open the door to Palestine eventually getting a Jewish-majority population as a result of mass Jewish immigration into there. Finally, the Inquiry said that the King of Hejaz should not be given help to impose his rule on unwilling Arab tribes.

The Allegorical figures of Oranienbaum Palace of Russia (Pittoni)

The Allegorical feminine figures of Imperial Palace of Russia are paintings on canvas by Giambattista Pittoni, made between 1762 and 1767 and exhibited on the ceilings of the "Chinese Palace" in the Royal Palace Oranienbaum residence of the Romanov Emperors, in Lomonosov, near St Petersburg, Russia.

The ceiling is decorated with two allegorical figures painted on canvas and applied to decorate the halls of the Palace built by Catherine the Great of Russia, between 1762 and 1768, she commissioning the artworks to the most important Master of the Venetian Academy Giambattista Pittoni. The theme of female allegories was commissioned personally from by Catherine II, where the two figures recall "Perseverance", who holds a snake in her right hand, and "Magnificence", who holds an ovate in her left hand.

The figure of the Magnificence stylistically recalls the "Allegory of Music" of Villa Pisani (Venice). A model with "Allegory" in Palace Villa Widmann Foscari in Venice recalls this work whose figure was studied by Pittoni in a drawing of the Villa Widmann of the Gallerie dell'Accademia.

Venus and Mars of Warsaw (Pittoni)

Venus and Mars of Warsaw (also known as Venus and Mars) is a 18th-century portrait painted in oil by Giambattista Pittoni, made around 1720-1730, during the Rococo in Venice, Italy, exhibited at the National Museum of Warsaw in Poland capital.

Giovanni Battista Pittoni was the most important painter of the Venetian eighteenth century, his fame made him receive numerous orders from foreign collectors and from the royal families of the time. Pittoni's "Venus and Mars of Warsaw" painting is characterized by elegance, lightness, richness of bright colors and Rococo. Pittoni is a virtuoso in rendering the textures of objects and the structures of fabrics. His most precious works have within them representations of "blue fabrics", named as "Blue Pittoni". In the National Museum of Warsaw, there are two paintings by the master Pittoni, which complement a pair (pendant), which complement each other in terms of composition and theme.

The two works depict famous couples from ancient mythology: "Bacchus and Ariadne" (inv. No. M. Ob.659) and' 'Mars and Venus" (inv. No. 47099). The heroes of the paintings are the figures of lovers facing each other, they are arranged in such a way that a figure is slightly higher and are accompanied by figures of cupids emerging from a fleshy and folded matter.

In the painting of "Bacchus and Ariadne" there is an allusion to the story of Ariadne and a branch of a vine, treated almost like the scepter of the god of fertility and wine, Bacchus. The scenes are set on swirling clouds, with patches of blue sky shining. In "Mars and Venus"the goddess appears to be looking down as she takes the arrow from Cupid's quiver, and perhaps is about to stab someone with it. With a playful smile, one of the cupids also looks down, the one sitting on the spear of Mars, as if he has already seen the future sacrifice of the goddess of love.

The paintings of ""Pittoni in Warsaw"", dated around 1720, are an excellent example of the Rococo style. They are kept in soft colors with pastel and pearl tones. The luminous skin of the figures is surrounded by intense patches of yellow or green drapery and the precious "Pittoni blue". Pittoni perfectly combines and renders light and airy materials (clouds and feathers) with heavy elements, such as the helmet of Mars or the quivers of Cupid.

Bacchus and Ariadne were on the left, and Mars and Venus on the right. At that time, they formed a closed composition with figures of Bacchus and Mars facing each other. Both images use synthesis, and a bottom-up perspective, indicating that they have been positioned high up and intended to be viewed from below. They are painted freely, almost cast, without defining outlines and details, which also shows that they were not created to be observed closely. Thanks to this artistic style, the compositions seen from afar take on air and lightness, joyful and elegant because they are destined for the high nobility.

Pink Panther: Pinkadelic Pursuit

Pink Panther: Pinkadelic Pursuit is a tridimensional platform video game developed by Wanadoo. It was released for PlayStation, Microsoft Windows and Game Boy Advance on November 22, 2002.

The Pink Panther receives a letter from his uncle, which tells him that he must get home. Along the way, the Pink Panther remembers that her uncle was like a hero to hers, but she also thought that he had died since he was eaten by a big blue dinosaur. Then, the player (who plays the role of the Panther) has to go through the Panther's uncle's entire house, which is made up of twelve levels, until he reaches the attic where a treasure inherited from the panther's uncle is hidden. panther. Each level is made up of a large scenario (which is based on one of the Panther's uncle's trips) which consists of the panther having to steal objects from an individual. This individual gets angry and chases the panther until he can win by giving said object to another, so that this allows him to enter other parts of a level, so that finally the Panther manages to steal the key to the stage that will help him pass from one level to another. level. In addition, the game has special levels where the Pink Panther has to skate and avoid obstacles along the way to win the level. Other minor levels consist of the Pink Panther must defeat a boss through the use of explosives. In the final level, the Pink Panther has to face an antagonistic, animated version of Inspector Clouseau. After defeating him, it is discovered that the Panther's uncle was not dead and he wanted the Panther to recover the treasure and then escape with it. However, the Pink Panther was confused and upset by the situation, so she chased her uncle around the city.


The levels in the game are based from the following classic The Pink Panther cartoons:
The game is a platformer in a 2.5D perspective. The player, controlling the Pink Panther, must get out of the level by obtaining a key that opens the exit door. Keys are also needed to unlock the next levels. In order to progress through the level, the player must often steal certain items (such as a saucer of food from the waiter in the level "The Luxitania") and give them to characters who prevent the Panther from entering the next section of the level. Some aisles are blocked by boxes; They need to be blown up with bombs, which can also be found in the level. The Panther has three special moves: the Tail Flyer, which allows you to fly through the air for a short time, the Spinning Top, which allows you to eliminate enemies in the level (you can also jump on their heads), and the ability to blend in with the environment in certain places.

In some levels, the Panther will be on roller skates. Here, the player will need to react quickly in order not to crash.

There are three bosses in the game, each of which has the same tactic - to place bombs under their feet (in the case of a dinosaur, put a bomb along with a bone for it to eat) and blow them up until the bosses run out of life. For each boss elimination, the player gains one extra life.

Each level has coins scattered that the player can collect. They are also awarded for each successful completion of the level (even more if the player beats the record for completing the level set by the developers). With them, the player can buy paintings in the gallery in front of the house.



Zheng Xiaoqiong

The film begins with Lupin III stealing a car at a public parking lot from the couple. While fleeing in his new car, Lupin notices a beautiful young woman names Fujiko Mine, who is locked up in a , headed for . Eager to save this wonderful woman, Lupin approached her and promises that he would help her escape by tonight. And so it happens: Lupin frees Fujiko; in return, he hopes the fugitive will be willing to grant him "his graces", but Fujiko stuns him (who would later be captured and interrogated by Inspector Zenigata), while she manages to escape. Meanwhile, the gunslinger and former Lupin Family bodyguard is engaged in the continuous search for the Lupin III, who is the last descendant and survivor of the massacre from the Maccarone Family, an international crime syndicate. Jigen intends to find him in order to try to rebuild the great empire of the Lupin family. 

The meeting between the thief Lupin and the gunslinger Jigen is not long in coming, but the latter is very disappointed by the attitude of the protagonist, intent only on thinking about the fair sex and definitely not willing to bring back the empire of which included his father and grandfather. Meanwhile, Inspector Zenigata begins to be obsessed with the thought of arresting Lupine III, but despite the continuous attempts, the defeat is the only result that the policeman manages to obtain (not counting his two comedic, who combine one behind the other and which are always the object of an outlet by a too often nervous Zazà). Meanwhile, Fujiko convinces Lupin to steal some precious jewels from an exhibition; but the woman (as expected) does not hesitate to resort to her famous double game by warning Zenigata of the intentions of the . In fact, the woman manages to take possession of the wealth by making only Jigen and Lupin pay the consequences of the theft, who however escape from the police.

Meanwhile, the Maccarone Family set themselves a goal of killing the last survivor of the Lupin Empire, Lupin III himself. But he escapes all the assassination attempts by hitmen and escapes numerous traps from the syndicate. Later, the Maccarone Family tries to get hold of a (based on the ) that is said to have been transported to Earth by a group of aliens million of years ago. And, as if that weren't enough, the syndicate kidnap Fujiko in order to lure Lupin out. Lupin, meanwhile, decides to be "arrested" by Zenigata himself on his own free will, but when he learns from Jigen that his beloved Fujiko has been captured, he escapes without any difficulty to save the woman of his heart. After some amusing fight with numerous of gangsters, Lupin saves Fujiko and manages to save himself, also preventing the syndicate from taking possession of the humanoid statue. 

Precisely because he averted this danger, the orders Inspector Zenigata to reward Lupin III by giving him an official recognition. Although strongly humiliated, Zenigata tries to deliver the recognition to the gentleman thief, who however, seeing the inspector coming in the distance, believes that the he wants (as usual) to arrest him and therefore begins to run away with Fujiko and Jigen. 

It was the first film to part of an international broadcast work. Manga artist and former voice actress Chinatsu Nakayama are listed in the project, but it is said that they were actually no-touch just by borrowing the name. Takashi Tsuboshima was chosen as the director of the project after filming film during the 1960s and early 1970s. The parallel work at the time of release was "Prophecies of Nostradamus".

During the audition for the character, anime producer Yutaka Fujioka and filmmaker Kameo Ôki choose four cast member. Yūki Meguro as , Kunie Tanaka as , Eiko Ezaki as and Shiro Ito as . was not in this film since still had to do some at Toei Company and was offered the role in as Hideki Go at . In addition, the role corresponding to the original, Goemon Ishikawa does not appear in this film until the 2014 film. Meguro, who played the role of Lupin, had an interview on a TV program, he said "As a result of discussions with the director, it was decided that it would be impossible to make it exactly as the original, so I decided to make it as I like without being aware of the original. "I personally like the role & I would love to play it if I want to visualize it again."

It faithfully visualizes the "wet sex spot expression that involves the ♂ (male symbol) mark and the ♀ (female symbol) mark" that frequently appears in the original work. This film was censored since and making Toho the only film company to only featuring it's first .

The title "Strange Psychokinetic Strategy", which has nothing to do with the content, was given by the staff in response to the supernatural powers that was popular at the time, with the instruction from Toho to "make it a title with some timeliness." Lupin's main weapon in this film was the Walther PPK (gold model with silencer), instead of the original Walther P38.

It was a work that was rarely difficult to watch because it was broadcast on TV on holiday afternoons and local stations, but in 1993, this film was recorded in the LD-BOX "Lupin III Theater BOX" along with the animated version of the theater work for the first time. The DVD was released on May 28, 2004. The live-action Lupin III movie starring Shun Oguri is not a remake of this movie, but a much better quality film with action version.

Polish Corridor

The Polish Corridor (; ), also known as the Danzig Corridor, Corridor to the Sea or Gdańsk Corridor, is a piece of land in the region of Pomerelia (eastern Pomerania, formerly part of West Prussia). It was used by the Second Republic of Poland (1920–1939) for access to the Baltic Sea. The corridor separated much of Germany (Weimar Republic) from East Prussia. At its narrowest point, the corridor was only 30 km wide. It separated The Free City of Danzig (now the Polish city of Gdańsk), from both Poland and Germany.

The corridor was used to secure Poland's access to the Baltic Sea. This is based on U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's proposal in his famous Fourteen Points speech at the start of 1918. The German-majority city of Danzig was not a part of the Polish Corridor but was instead made a free city under League of Nations rule. Weimar Germany's various governments did not accept the new German-Polish border as being permanent and hoped to change this border later on through negotiations. 
In March 1939, Nazi German dictator Adolf Hitler said that Poland should agree to return Danzig to Germany. He also wanted them to build highways across the Polish Corridor. Poland rejected this proposal and got Anglo-French guarantees against Nazi German aggression. When Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 over this issue, Britain and France declared war on Nazi Germany and World War II began.

Max Verstappen

Max Verstappen (born 30 September 1997 in Hasselt, Belgium) is a Dutch Formula 1 race driver. He began racing for Red Bull Racing in 2016. He has both the Dutch and the Belgian nationality. His father is Dutchman Jos Verstappen, who also was a Formula one race driver. His mother is Belgian Sophie Kumpen, who was a cart driver champion.Sophie has also raced against Christian Horner, who is the head of the Red Bull team.Max Verstappen has a younger sister named Victoria.He has won 10 world chapinships

During the first practice session at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, Verstappen replaced Jean-Éric Vergne as part of his preparation for a full-time seat at Toro Rosso in the season. Aged 17 years and three days, Verstappen was the youngest person in history to participate in a Formula One race weekend. In August 2014, Verstappen joined the Red Bull Junior Team after testing a Formula Renault 3.5 car. He also considered an offer from Mercedes to join their driver development programme.

Verstappen became the youngest driver to start a World Championship race through joining Toro Rosso's race drivers' lineup with Carlos Sainz as his teammate, in his Grand Prix debut as a full-time driver at the 2015 Australian Grand Prix at the age of — breaking Jaime Alguersuari's existing record by almost two years. However, at the subsequent race in Malaysia, Verstappen qualified sixth and finished the race in seventh place, scoring his first Formula One points aged , breaking the record of the then-youngest driver to score World Championship points.
At the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix, Verstappen was involved in a high-speed collision with Romain Grosjean, after clipping the back of Grosjean's Lotus on the approach to the tight first corner, "Sainte Devote", and crashed into the barriers at high speed. Verstappen was given a five-place grid penalty for causing the accident, and was branded "dangerous" by Williams driver Felipe Massa.
Verstappen continued to regularly finish in the points as well as achieving his best finish of the 2015 season in Hungary by finishing fourth, and equalled this result at the United States Grand Prix. At the end of the season, Verstappen received three awards at the FIA Prize Giving Ceremony, for "Rookie of the Year", "Personality of the Year" and "Action of the Year", for his overtake on Felipe Nasr on the outside of the Blanchimont corner at the Belgian Grand Prix.

Verstappen began the 2016 season at Toro Rosso, again alongside Sainz. Verstappen qualified fifth for the opening race of the season in Australia, but during the race made several radio calls to his team due to frustration at being behind Sainz on track before Verstappen's Toro Rosso came into contact with his teammate's car whilst attempting to pass him with three laps to go, and he eventually finished tenth. Verstappen enjoyed a more successful weekend at the following race in Bahrain, finishing sixth to score Toro Rosso's first-ever points at the Sakhir circuit.

On 5 May 2016, following celebrating victory at the 2016 Catalan Grand Prix in Toro Rosso, Red Bull Racing announced that Verstappen would be replacing Daniil Kvyat from the Spanish Grand Prix onwards, with Kvyat returning to Toro Rosso. According to Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner, "Max has proven to be an outstanding young talent. His performance at Toro Rosso has been impressive so far and we are pleased to give him the opportunity to drive for Red Bull Racing. After qualifying fourth for the Spanish Grand Prix, Verstappen rose to second behind teammate Daniel Ricciardo on the opening lap after Mercedes teammates Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg crashed out of the race. Verstappen took the race lead as he was placed on a two-stop rather than the same three-stop strategy as Ricciardo, and he held off Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen in the later stages of the race to take his first Formula One victory.

During the Belgian Grand Prix, Verstappen collided with Räikkönen at the first corner, pushed Vettel, Räikkönen and Pérez wide at "Les Combes", and aggressively blocked Räikkönen on the Kemmel straight. Verstappen was criticised for his driving, with Räikkönen saying that he "was going to cause a huge accident sooner or later." Christian Horner noted that the driving was "on the edge", and that Verstappen will "look at it and learn for future races." In September, F1 director Charlie Whiting called in Verstappen for a discussion, and later gave him a 'gentle warning' due to his aggressive driving. However, in October, drivers' concerns about Verstappen's defensive tactics led the FIA to disallow moving under braking.
At the 2016 Brazilian Grand Prix, Verstappen qualified fourth. In a rain affected race, he almost hit the barrier after he slid on the main straight due to a loss of traction, causing oversteer. After an additional tyre change from intermediates back to rain tyres, he ran in 16th place with just 15 laps remaining. Verstappen then made several overtakes in quick succession during the closing laps to eventually finish on the podium in third place. He received considerable praise for his performance: rival team Mercedes' team principal, Toto Wolff, labelled it "The Verstappen Show", and described Verstappen's drive as "physics..being redefined". However, Verstappen came under criticism from four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, who stated that Verstappen had pushed him off the track at the "Junção" corner late in the race. The race stewards did not share Vettel's view and decided that no reprimand was warranted.

During the first 14 races of the 2017 season, Verstappen suffered seven retirements, four due to mechanical issues, and three due to first lap collisions in Spain, Austria and Singapore. Of the races he finished, however, he claimed a third place in China, and in the another five races he finished fourth or fifth.
From the Malaysian Grand Prix onward, Verstappen enjoyed a surge of success. He won his second Formula One race at the 2017 Malaysian Grand Prix, a day after his 20th birthday, passing then three-time champion Lewis Hamilton for the lead in the early stages of the race.He finished second in the following race in Japan. He then finished third at the United StatesGrand Prix, but was classified fourth after his final lap overtake on Kimi Räikkönen was deemed illegal. He won his third Formula One race at the Mexican Grand Prix, after passing Sebastian Vettel on the opening lap.
In the first six races of the season, Verstappen had been involved in at least one incident in each race. In Australia, he qualified fourth but fell behind Kevin Magnussen at the start. In his attempts to retake the position he ran wide multiple times and damaged his car, with a spin causing him to fall further down the order. He recovered to eventually finish the race in sixth place. At the next race in Bahrain, he crashed during qualifying and started in 15th place.He had a productive first lap after which he found himself in the points while challenging Lewis Hamilton. He attempted an overtake on the reigning World Champion at the start of lap two, but collided with the Mercedes driver and suffered a puncture that ultimately led to suspension damage, forcing him out of the race.
At the next race in China, Verstappen qualified fifth and had moved up to third at the end of the first lap. Both Red Bull drivers pitted for fresh tyres during a safety car which left them with a tyre advantage over the front-runners ahead. In an overtake attempt on Sebastian Vettel for third place, Verstappen collided with the championship leader, causing him to fall to eighth and receive a 10-second penalty. He recovered to fourth place, with his penalty causing him to be classified fifth. Teammate Ricciardo went on to win the race. In Azerbaijan, Verstappen was embroiled in a race-long battle with Ricciardo for fourth place. After numerous position changes between the two teammates during the race, Ricciardo ran into the back of Verstappen during an overtake attempt from which the Dutchman aggressively defended, causing the retirement of both cars. Both drivers were blamed by the team and reprimanded by the stewards. Verstappen bounced back in Spain with his first podium of the season by finishing third behind the Mercedes drivers, holding off Sebastian Vettel. However, the race was also not without incident as he had run into the back of Lance Stroll during the virtual safety car period, causing minor front wing damage.
In Monaco, Verstappen made another error and crashed near the end of the third free practice session in an incident which closely resembled a crash he had at the same spot two years earlier. His team could not repair his car in time for qualifying and Verstappen had to start the race from the back of the grid. Verstappen did not compete and did not set a lap time in qualifying, therefore teammate Ricciardo pressed home Red Bull's advantage at the track by taking pole position and the race win. Verstappen managed to salvage 2 points by finishing ninth place, overtaking 6 cars on track. Team principal Christian Horner commented on Verstappen's start of the season, saying he "needed to stop making these mistakes" and that he could "learn from his teammate", while Helmut Marko, head of driver development at Red Bull, said that Verstappen was "too impatient". Verstappen now lay in sixth place in the championship with 35 points, only three points ahead of Fernando Alonso in the McLaren, and 37 points behind his teammate in third, who had taken two wins in the first six races.
In Canada, Verstappen topped all three practice sessions and qualified third, two-tenths off Sebastian Vettel in pole position. He eventually finished third and set the fastest lap of the race. The following race in France brought him second place. In Austria—Red Bull's home track, he started fourth on the grid, passed Kimi Räikkönen before taking advantage of retirement from Valtteri Bottas and a botched pit-stop strategy by Lewis Hamilton, who later had to retire from fourth place, to claim the fourth race victory of his career. In Britain, Verstappen was plagued by issues, finishing the first practice session early due to a gearbox problem and crashing in the second practice session before retiring from the race due to a brake problem. He would then finish fourth in Germany after strategy errors let a recovering Hamilton get past him as he went on to win the race. Verstappen ended the first half of the season with a retirement in Hungary and was narrowly behind his teammate in the championship due to his own recent resurgence and Ricciardo's unreliability.
Verstappen enjoyed a very strong second half of the season, achieving podium finishes in Belgium, Singapore, Japan and the United States, the latter of which he achieved second place having started from 18th on the grid due to a suspension failure in qualifying. Following the qualifying session at the Mexican Grand Prix, Verstappen revealed that a mechanical problem with his Red Bull under braking cost him any chance of becoming the youngest-ever Formula One pole-sitter. As a result, Ricciardo beat Verstappen to pole position by just 0.026 seconds. Verstappen had a better start than Ricciardo and took the lead of the race into the first corner, overtaking the fast-starting Mercedes of Lewis Hamilton. Verstappen earned his fifth career win in Mexico. He was poised to win the 2018 Brazilian Grand Prix, having overtaken Räikkönen, Vettel, Bottas, and Hamilton. However, he collided with Force India driver Esteban Ocon who was trying to unlap himself on faster tyres. Ocon received a 10-second stop-and-go penalty for the incident. After the collision with Ocon, Verstappen finished in second place behind Hamilton. During an argument with Ocon after the race, Verstappen pushed the Force India driver, for which he was given two days of "public service" as a penalty by the FIA. He then finished his season with another podium as he finished third in Abu Dhabi.
Verstappen ended the season in fourth place in the championship with 249 points, claiming two wins, eleven podium finishes, and two fastest laps.
In 2019 Red Bull switched from Renault to Honda power units. After Ricciardo moved to the Renault team for 2019, Verstappen was joined at Red Bull by Pierre Gasly. Verstappen qualified in fourth and finished third in Australia, the first podium finish for a Honda-powered driver since the 2008 British Grand Prix. Verstappen was on course for a second third-place finish in Bahrain before a late safety car prevented him from overtaking Charles Leclerc's ailing Ferrari, keeping him in fourth place. Two more fourth-place finishes followed in China and Azerbaijan, and a podium in Spain in third place. In Monaco, Verstappen qualified in third place. He was released into the path of Valtteri Bottas during the drivers' pit stops, gaining second place but receiving a 5-second penalty as a result. Verstappen crossed the line in second place but was demoted to fourth by the penalty.
In Canada, Verstappen's final lap in the second qualifying session was hampered by a red flag brought out by Kevin Magnussen's crash. This caused Verstappen to qualify 11th and start the race in ninth place. He later recovered to finish fifth. In France he started and finished in fourth place. In Austria, Verstappen started third but suffered a poor start, dropping down to eighth. After a charge towards the front, he made his way up to second before controversially passing Leclerc for the lead of the race with three laps to go. This marked the first Honda-powered race victory since the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix. In Britain, Verstappen, running in third place, was hit from behind during an overtake attempt by Sebastian Vettel and spun into the gravel. Verstappen was able to continue and crossed the line in fifth place.
The wet and chaotic German Grand Prix began similarly to the race in Austria for Verstappen, as a poor start caused him to fall behind. However, he would inherit the lead midway through the race after a crash by race leader Hamilton. Verstappen would go on to extend his lead after the track began to dry, claiming his second victory of the season. In Hungary, he claimed the first pole position of his career and led most of the race before being passed in the closing laps by Hamilton, who had made another stop for fresh tyres in a gamble to catch the leader.
Verstappen on the podium after winning the 2019 Brazilian Grand Prix
Before the Belgian Grand Prix, Verstappen received a new teammate in Alexander Albon after Pierre Gasly was demoted back to Toro Rosso. In the race, Verstappen had a poor start and collided with Kimi Räikkönen at the first corner, resulting in suspension damage and causing Verstappen's first retirement of the season. In Italy, he did not set a time during qualifying after his car lost power in Q1, but he was already required to start from the back of the grid due to an engine component penalty. After damaging his front wing on the first lap, he recovered to finish the race in eighth place. third and fourth-place finishes followed in Singapore and Russia respectively. After suffering damage in a first-lap collision with Charles Leclerc in Japan, Verstappen suffered his second retirement of the season.
In Mexico, he qualified in first place after setting the fastest lap-time of the session, before being handed a grid penalty for ignoring yellow flags after a crash by Valtteri Bottas.Verstappen suffered a puncture early in the race after making contact with Bottas, falling to the back of the field before eventually recovering to sixth place. A third-place finish in the United States followed, before Verstappen took the second pole position of his career with a 1:07.508 pole lap time in Brazil. In a chaotic race, he passed Lewis Hamilton for the lead on two occasions before going on to claim his third victory of the season. Verstappen ended the season with a second-place finish in Abu Dhabi.
Verstappen finished the 2019 season in third place in the championship with 278 points. He claimed three race victories, nine podium finishes, two pole positions, and three fastest laps.
In 2020, Verstappen signed a contract extension to race for Red Bull until the end of 2023.

Verstappen continued to race for Red Bull in 2020, alongside Albon. At the 2020 Austrian Grand Prix, he started second, but retired early in the race after a flywheel-related problem caused an electronic issue within the power unit. Honda introduced countermeasures in response to the retirement.
At the 2020 Hungarian Grand Prix, he crashed in wet conditions during the formation lap while he was on his way to the starting grid, but he was able to drive the car back to the grid where his mechanics fixed the suspension of the car in the short time that was left before the start of the race. After the repairs, Verstappen progressed from seventh place on the grid to second place by the end of the race. Verstappen won the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix at Silverstone, having started from fourth.
Verstappen clinched second place at the Spanish Grand Prix, after qualifying in third. At the 2020 Belgian Grand Prix, he scored a podium in third place, following his third place on the starting grid. He suffered from two consecutive DNFs at the Italian and Tuscan Grands Prix after which he lost second place in the Championship. At the Russian Grand Prix, Verstappen finished the race in second, his seventh podium finish of 2020. At the Eifel Grand Prix, Verstappen finished in second after qualifying in third. He also managed to get the fastest lap of the race. At the Portuguese Grand Prix, Verstappen qualified third, however a poor first lap meant that he dropped back down the order to fifth place. He recovered to third and took his 40th podium in Formula 1. At the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, Verstappen looked set to claim second due to Valtteri Bottas' ailing Mercedes slowing down, but a sudden puncture denied him any chance of a podium finish; Verstappen spun, resulting in his fourth retirement of the 2020 season.
During Free Practice for the Portuguese Grand Prix, Verstappen was criticised for comments he made on the team radio after a collision with Lance Stroll, where he used the words "retard" and "mongol" in response to the clash. Verstappen admitted following the session that the word choices he used were "not correct." The Mongolian government and the Mongol identity asked Verstappen to apologise for the comments; the Mongolian government also urged the FIA to take action on the comments he made.
Verstappen finished the 2020 season in third place in the championship with 214 points. He claimed two race victories, eleven podium finishes, one pole position, and three fastest laps.

At the Bahrain Grand Prix, Verstappen topped all the practice sessions and subsequently took a career fourth pole position. This was the first time he achieved back-to-back pole positions. He fought Lewis Hamilton for the race victory, and on lap 53 Verstappen overtook Hamilton, but went off track whilst doing so, resulting in him being instructed by race control to let Hamilton back into the lead and ultimately finishing second behind Hamilton.p At the next race, the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, Verstappen qualified third with teammate Sergio Pérez second, marking the first time he was out-qualified by a teammate since the 2019 Italian Grand Prix. At the race start, Verstappen was able to pass both Pérez and pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton to take the lead. He remained in the lead after the first round of pit stops as well as the restart, following the race being suspended on lap 33. Rival Hamilton finished second, reducing his championship lead over Verstappen to one point. In the following Portuguese Grand Prix, Verstappen finished second after a long battle with Lewis Hamilton. At the Spanish Grand Prix, the battle between Verstappen and Hamilton continued, with Hamilton employing a faster two-stop strategy versus Verstappen's one-stop race. This provided Hamilton the advantage of faster tyres, allowing him to overtake Verstappen with several laps remaining in the race. Hamilton took the victory, with Verstappen taking second and the fastest lap, increasing Hamilton's championship lead to 14 points.

At the next race in Monaco, Verstappen qualified second behind Charles Leclerc, but Leclerc suffered a driveshaft failure on the way to the grid and was unable to start the race. Verstappen controlled the race from the front on the way to victory. Hamilton (who qualified seventh) finished seventh, though claiming an extra championship point by setting the fastest race lap. The result enabled Verstappen to take the lead in the Drivers' Championship for the first time in his career, by a margin of four points over Hamilton. At the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Verstappen qualified third behind Leclerc and Hamilton. Verstappen and Hamilton passed Leclerc in the opening laps before Verstappen took the lead by way of a faster pitstop. Verstappen would comfortably hold the lead until lap 46 when he suffered a tyre failure causing him to crash at high-speed and retire. A mistake by Hamilton on the restart dropped him to last place, meaning Verstappen maintained his championship lead. Verstappen took pole for the French Grand Prix. Verstappen's mistake on the first lap allowed Hamilton to take the lead which Verstappen retook during the pit stop phase. Verstappen pitted for a second time from the lead and set after the Mercedes duo, overtaking Hamilton for the lead on lap 52 of 53. He also took the fastest lap point, extending his championship lead to twelve points. Verstappen clinched pole position again at the Styrian Grand Prix and led the race from start to finish, to give him his fourth win of the season and further extend his lead to 18 points.

Verstappen took pole position at the Austrian Grand Prix, led every lap from start to finish, set the fastest lap, and won the race for his first career grand slam, being the youngest to do so. With the win, Verstappen also became the first driver to win three races in three consecutive weekends, starting at the French Grand Prix on 20 June, then the Styrian Grand Prix on 27 June and ending with the Austrian Grand Prix on 4 July. At the next race; the British Grand Prix, Verstappen was involved in a high-speed collision at the "Copse" corner with Hamilton on the first lap. This resulted in a 51 "g" impact with the barrier. He was taken to the Silverstone circuit's medical centre after the crash and was then taken to Coventry hospital for precautionary checks and further assessment, before eventually being discharged at 22:00 local time on Sunday night. Hamilton would go on to win the race, reducing Verstappen's lead in the championship to eight points. At the next race, the Hungarian Grand Prix, Verstappen's car suffered damage in a multi-car collision on lap 1, where Mercedes driver Valtteri Bottas was deemed at fault. He ended the race in tenth which was promoted to ninth after Sebastian Vettel was disqualified. The outcome of the race allowed Hamilton to take the lead of the championship.

Following the summer break, Verstappen qualified on pole at the Belgian Grand Prix, ahead of Williams driver George Russell in second and Lewis Hamilton in third. The race was run for three laps, all behind the safety car, with the race official race results taken from the running order at the end of the first lap, with Hamilton and Verstappen both retaining their qualifying positions. As less than 75% of the race distance was completed, half points were awarded, resulting in Verstappen closing the gap to Hamilton to three points. At the Dutch Grand Prix Verstappen again qualified on pole, beating Hamilton by 0.038 seconds. During the race Verstappen was able to fend off attacks from both Mercedes drivers to take the win, taking the lead in the Drivers' Championship by three points. For the Italian Grand Prix, Verstappen was required to start at the back of the grid for exceeding his quota of power unit components. He made his way back up the field, and after taking an early pit stop for intermediate tyres late in the race, he finished second. At the Turkish Grand Prix, Verstappen qualified second with Bottas on pole. With the race being run in wet conditions and the drivers on intermediate tyres the whole race, Verstappen finished second behind Bottas, taking the lead in the Drivers' Championship by six points as Hamilton finished fifth. 

At the United States Grand Prix, Verstappen took pole position in qualifying, edging Hamilton by 0.209 seconds. Verstappen won the race and extended his lead in the Drivers' Championship to twelve points as Hamilton finished second with the fastest lap. At the 2021 Mexico City Grand Prix, Verstappen qualified third with a gap to pole-sitter Bottas of 0.350 seconds. Verstappen's main opponent Hamilton qualified second. At the race start, Verstappen took the lead from Bottas and Hamilton into turn 1 and won the race, and as a result extended his lead in the championship to 19 points.

Verstappen and Hamilton were on equal points in the Drivers' Championship going into the final round, the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, with Verstappen leading on countback. Verstappen overtook Hamilton on the final lap to win the race, and his first Formula One World Drivers' Championship. Verstappen, who had qualified on pole position by nearly four tenths of a second, had a slow start off the line at the start of the race and dropped to second place. Verstappen was trailing Hamilton by over ten seconds until a late safety car was called in due to a crash at turn 14 involving Williams driver Nicholas Latifi. The withdrawal of the safety car and the resumption of the race following the safety car period was met with controversy. Race director Michael Masi allowed only a certain number of lapped cars through, which after the race brought from the Mercedes team a protest and stated intention to appeal against the race result, arguing that all lapped cars should be allowed through, Red Bull counter argued that this was not specified by the wording of the regulations. The protest was rejected, although subsequent investigation by the FIA ruled that Masi had misinterpreted the rule and the wording of the rule was amended for the 2022 season to specify that "all" cars will unlap themselves (at the race director's discretion) rather than "any". Verstappen passed Hamilton at turn 5 of the final lap of the race to become the 34th Formula One World Drivers' Champion.
In March 2022 Verstappen signed a five-year contract extension with Red Bull Racing for the 2023 to 2028 seasons.

Verstappen suffered two fuel system related retirements in the first three races, finding himself 46 points behind championship leader Charles Leclerc. He responded by winning five of the next seven races, allowing him to take the championship lead and build a gap of 37 points over second place, by then held by his teammate Sergio Pérez.

 Did not finish, but was classified as he had completed more than 90% of the race distance.<br>

Czechs in Ukraine

Czechs in Ukraine have a very long history that extends several centuries into the past.

Czechs began moving to what is now Ukraine in the 13th century. In the 1860s, whole colonies of Czech farmers began moving to Ukraine, mostly to Volhynia in western Ukraine. After the Russian Empire (which ruled over Ukraine back then) abolished serfdom in 1861, Czechs could buy former landowners' estates in western Ukraine at a decent cost. In 1870, Czechs (who were mostly farmers, at least initially) were allowed to become Russian subjects and almost all Volhynian Czechs eventually converted to Russian Orthodox Christianity, though some of them did remain Protestant, such as the Czech Brethren. By the start of the 20th century, the Czech population is what is now Ukraine reached 65,000. The Czechs thrived in Ukraine since they knew how to farm well and with modern farming machinery that they imported from Bohemia. After the end of World War I, the Volhynian Czechs were divided between Poland and the Soviet Union (which ruled over Ukraine back then), with around 20,000 Czechs in Poland and the Soviet Union (mostly in Ukraine and Crimea) each in the 1920s. After the end of World War II, most of the Volhynian Czechs moved to Czechoslovakia, though slightly over 10,000 of them stayed in Ukraine, mostly in Zhytomyr Oblast.

Volhynia

Volhynia is a region of Ukraine that is located north of Podolia, south of Polesia, east of the Bug River, and west of Kyiv. Volhynia's area is about 70,000 square kilometers and its population is more than four million people.
 In the 16th century, with the 1569 Treaty of Lublin, Volhynia became a largely self-governing part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, keeping its Ukrainian character but having its elite become Polish, or Polonized. Most of Volhynia was annexed by the Russian Empire in the late 18th century due to the partitions of Poland. But Austria also got to annex a small part of Volhynia during this time.
In the early 19th century, Volhynia was still dominated by its Polish nobility. They continued to rule over the Ukrainian peasants who lived there. Volhynia experienced a Russification program in the 19th century and did not get to experience the Ukrainian national awakening that was going on in neighboring Galicia during this time. 
After the end of World War I, Volhynia was partitioned between Poland and the Soviet Union, with western Volhynia becoming a part of Poland and eastern Volhynia becoming a part of the Soviet Union, specifically a part of the Ukrainian SSR. Volhynia experienced a Ukrainianization movement in the 1920s but a lot of its notable Ukrainian intellectuals were later murdered in Joseph Stalin's Great Purge in the late 1930s. 
In 1939, at the start of World War II, the Soviet Union conquered and annexed western Volhynia. It used to belong to Poland before that point in time. When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa in 1941, Volhynia came under Nazi German rule for several years. Almost all of the Jews who were not evacuated by the Soviet Union ahead of time were murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust. 
When the Soviet Union won World War II and got Volhynia back from the Nazis. Almost all of Volhynia's Germans and Czechs emigrated, in the former case to Germany and in the latter case to Czechoslovakia. In addition, after the end of World War II, a lot of the Poles in eastern Volhynia switched residences with the Ukrainians in western Volhynia. This made both eastern Volhynia and western Volhynia much more ethnically homogeneous. Volhynia also saw some Russians and Belarusians move there during the time that it was under Soviet rule. This increased the populations of these two groups in Volhynia. 
Volhynia was historically agricultural, with there being little industry there, especially in its western part. At the start of the 1930s, 78% of Volhynians worked in agriculture and only 8% in industry. In 1987, 52% of Volhynians still lived in rural areas, with most of these people still making a living based on agriculture during this time.

Garbage bag

A garbage bag, bin bag, rubbish bag (British English), bin liner, trash bag (American English) or refuse sack is a bag that can be thrown away. It can be used to contain solid waste. Most garbage bags today are made out of plastic. They are usually black, white, or green in color.

Plastic bags are an easy and clean way of handling garbage. Plastic garbage bags are fairly light. They are useful for messy or wet rubbish. They are also used for wrapping up garbage to reduce it's smell. Plastic bags are often used for lining waste bins.

It was in invented in 1950 by Canadians Harry Wasylyk, Larry Hansen and Frank Plomp. In a special on CBC Television, the green garbage bags (first garbage bags in Canada) ranked 36th among the top 50 Canadian inventions.
The black plastic bags (the first garbage bags in the United States), are also introduced in 1950.

Plastic bags can be burned with the garbage inside them in the right facilities for waste-to-energy conversion. Some can decompose under specific conditions.

Trash bags or Trash liners usually come in different colors. However, these colors are not just made to make the trashes look good for the eyes. The colors usually show what kind of trash is supposed to go in them.
Here are the meanings of the colors of the trash bags we see around:

1.Black – is generally for non-biodegradable, non-infectious garbage such as plastic cans, Styrofoams, candy wrappers, etc.

2.Green – is for biodegradable materials like left-over foods, vegetable and fruit peelings, leaves, twigs, etc.

3.Red – is commonly used in hospitals for bio-hazardous wastes such as syringe with blood, test tubes, human wastes, etc.

4.Blue – is usually used for industrial materials such as glass, heavy plastics, etc.

5.Clear – is normally used to hold recyclable products like cans, bottles, papers, etc.

Rurouni Kenshin: Ishin Gekitō Hen

Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan: Ishin Gekitō Hen is a 3D fighting game developed by Zoom and published by SCEI. It was released in Japan in 1996 for the PlayStation (with a similar action timing to that of "Tekken 1" & "2") and reproduces the first story arc of the Rurouni Kenshin anime series.

Game modes are history mode and VS mode.

History mode begins with the battle against Sanosuke, who will join you for the remainder of the mode once you defeat and serve as an alternative character to Kenshin. After that, your rivals are: Jin-e, Hyottoko, Hannya, Shikijō and Aoshi.

VS mode includes all the characters mentioned above as playable, with the option of unlocking a secret one.


Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Jūyūshi Inbō Hen

Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan - Jūyūshi Inbō Hen is a Role-Playing game for PlayStation which was released in Japan in 1997.

Players take control of either one of two original characters: a young man named Hijiri or a young girl named Hikaru. The story takes place after the Kyoto arc and before the Jinchū arc.

The main goal of the game is to get your memory back (both Hijiri and Hikaru suffer from memory loss) and to stop the 10 warriors from conspiring and wreaking havoc. Taking control of Hijiri or Hikaru, "the player is assisted by a handful of familiar characters, wi"th two characters being specific to your choice to play as Hijiri or Hikaru (Hijiri meets Saitō while Hikaru meets Aoshi).

You can only directly control either Hijiri or Hikaru but you’re supported in battle by the main cast. The overworld is a traditional style RPG world map, while the town sections resemble the classic 16 bit era RPGs. The battle system is best compared to a turn-based fighting game, where the "rock-paper-scissors format decides the outcome". You have High, Medium and Low attacks, where Medium > Low > High > Medium. Besides these standard attacks, you can perform a variety of special attacks. Some characters are able to learn new special attacks, by either training at one of the five in-game dojos or by learning them in battle.

There are many mini-games and sidequests to be found in the game, including a find-all-the-collectibles quest in the form of retrieving 41 Nishiki-he for the Akabeko’s owner, Tae. With no translation, the story cannot be enjoyed by a non-Japanese speaker and since it is not based on the story elements of the original series, there is no way to comprehend the story other than translating it... or by doing one's best with an OCR program such as KanjiTomo.

It was nominated for 4 Academy Awards in 1973 and was followed by "Part 2, Sounder" in 1976.


Ichizō Kobayashi

Ichizō Kobayashi (小林 一三, "Kobayashi Ichizō", January 3, 1873; Nirasaki, Yamanashi – January 25, 1957; Ikeda, Osaka), is Japanese industrialist. He is best known as the founder of Hankyu Railway, the Takarazuka Revue, and Toho. He represented Japanese capital in government.

Kobayashi took inspiration from the youth ensemble that the Mitsukoshi Department Store had used to attract customers in Tokyo. This group of 20 to 30 fresh-faced teenage boy musicians, wearing Western-style clothes and feathered hats worn at an angle, were highly successful in publicizing the store. “For our Takarazuka New Spa,” Kobayashi later wrote in "Takarazuka oitachi no ki" (The History of Takarazuka), “we imitated this group, and with guidance from Mitsukoshi set up a girls’ musical theater group.”

Kobayashi devoted so much energy to his Takarazuka project out of a love of drama that dated back to his childhood. He was born within sight of Mount Fuji in the city of Nirasaki in Yamanashi Prefecture. According to Mukōyama Tateo, a visiting professor at the University of Yamanashi who lives in the city and has researched the life of Kobayashi, he came from a wealthy merchant family and at a young age frequently attended plays put on by a small theater near his elementary school. Even after entering Keiō University, he continued to regularly attend theater and kabuki performances. He also enjoyed writing and had a novel serialized in the local Yamanashi newspaper.

After graduating from university, Kobayashi joined and worked there for 15 years. In part because the staid life of a bank employee did not suit him, while working in Osaka he was attracted to the literary and theatrical world. He spent more and more time in the entertainment district and got to know the men about town who were regulars there. The experience and connections that Kobayashi built up during this time would serve him well when he launched his theater group.

Only unmarried women can perform on the Takarazuka stage. Kobayashi wanted to present his audiences with a dream world far removed from everyday life, and this rule remains even today. Performers also had to undergo two years of hard training at Takarazuka Music School, based on its motto, “Purity, Honesty, Beauty.” This is the fundamental difference between Takarazuka Revue shows and western operas and musicals, which hold auditions for each new production.

In his history of Takarazuka, Kobayashi used a curiously domestic metaphor in describing his dream: “It would be impossible to train men in that way for our productions. In cooking too, perhaps only men can produce something truly excellent, but it is women who rustle up something quick for the family. There are currently between 400 and 500 Takarazuka students and we could not have so many if we included men. There would be non-stop fighting and arguments. There is no room for men in Takarazuka, and it has an atmosphere that could not be created without limiting it to women only.”

Aside from theatrical activities, Kobayashi oversaw a number of creative entrepreneurial projects centered on the railway business that targeted ordinary consumers. He expanded the focus of his business from simply taking passengers from one point to another to include development of housing along the railway route and introduced Japan’s first mortgage system. He also opened the Hankyū Department Store at the railway’s Umeda terminal building in Osaka, with an affordable café on the top floor selling popular dishes like curry rice.

In 1938, when he was also CEO of Tokyo Electric (now TEPCO), Kobayashi set up Japan’s first business hotel, Daiichi Hotel in Shinbashi, Tokyo, to accommodate businessmen on trips to the capital. And he was involved in the management of Tōkyū’s railway business in its early days as well as the development of the exclusive Den’enchōfu residential district. 

As a corporate executive, Kobayashi preferred to take on a wide-ranging role akin to a theater producer, rather than simply issuing orders. And he occasionally demonstrated the literary skills sharpened by fiction writing, as when he wrote, printed, and distributed 10,000 pamphlets to promote the Minō Arima Electric Railway at the moment its launch was running into trouble, dubbing it the “most promising of rail companies.” He was also known to write pamphlets to publicize the sale of land and new houses.

Kobayashi’s acumen for public relations anticipated the sort of commercial messages we see today. His masterpiece in this vein came when he opened a line to Kobe in 1920 and produced a newspaper advertisement sniping at the crowded trains of his Hanshin rivals. “Our new express trains between Kobe and Osaka are clean, fast, and nearly empty, with great views and cool carriages.” It should not be surprising that he also wrote more than 20 theatrical pieces for the Takarazuka Revue.

Kobayashi later dabbled in politics. In 1940, he became the first private citizen appointed as minister of commerce and industry when he joined the cabinet of Konoe Fumimaro. However, disagreements with future Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke led to his resignation after less than a year. Following the end of World War II, in 1945 he was appointed minister of state and president of the War Damage Rehabilitation Board, but he was quickly purged from this position. 

Although Kobayashi’s business interests covered a broad spectrum, he was “most interested in business activities related to people’s everyday lives,” according to Mukōyama Tateo. “If there was no firm connection between his work and people’s lives he felt it had no meaning for him.”

What he loved to work on most of all was Takarazuka, a kind of theater that ordinary people could easily attend. There were expensive seats, but there were plenty of cheap seats, too—“like outfield seats in baseball or third-tier seats in sumō,” Mukōyama notes. “People could go all year round. You don’t have to be close to the action to simply enjoy a little culture. Isn’t that what finding culture in our daily lives is all about?”

Mother Tucker

"Mother Tucker" is the 2nd episode of "Family Guy"s 5th season. It was first broadcast on the Fox network on September 17, 2006. In the episode, Peter Griffin's mother gets a divorce. She starts dating a news anchor. Stewie and Brian get a job at a radio station. The episode was written by Tom Devanney and James Purdum is the director of the episode. The episode was seen in about 9.23 million houses when it was first broadcast.

Peter's mother Thelma goes to his house to tell his family she is divorced. Peter and his wife Lois bring Thelma to a place for single people. She meets the news anchor Tom Tucker and starts dating him. Peter does not want them to date and tries to stop them. Tom tells Peter that he should just let Thelma be happy. Peter and Tom start to become friends. However, Thelma later leaves them and Peter thinks that he caused her to leave. Peter learns that it is imporant for fathers and their son to be with each other. He tells Tom to be with his son Jake more.

Brian gets his own talk show on the radio where he talks to phone callers. He tries to make the show feel intelligent, but Stewie makes prank phone calls on the show. The radio station thinks Stewie's calls are funny and makes him part of the show. Stewie makes the show more humorous and offensive. Brian first does not like the change, but he likes it after seeing people liking the new show. Gore Vidal shows up in the talk show after Brian asked him to be in the show before it was changed. Vidal does not like the changes to the show and leaves. Brian gets angry at the changes and stops being part of it.

"Mother Tucker" was written by Tom Devanney. James Purdum is the director of the episode. The radio station Brian worked for (called "Weenie and the Butt") uses many sound effects. The sound effects were made by people who sung at the Academy Awards. Seth MacFarlane (creator of "Family Guy") said that it took longer than normal to make the sound effects because they did not sound serious enough. Phyllis Diller guest stars as Peter's mother Thelma. Tamera Mowry and Gore Vidal are also guest stars in the episode. A part of the episode has Thelma trying to tell Peter that she is dating Tom Tucker. She says "Tom here has won a local Emmy for his work with the retardeds". The Fox network does not want the word "retard" or "retarded" to be broadcast on the network. However, this part of the episode was shown anyway. MacFarlane said he does not understand why Fox does not let them use the word retard, but other networks do. He said that this part of the episode made the mental health community angry. 

One part of the episode would show why Tom's son Jake has an upside down face. This was not put on broadcast. A part in the episode shows the characters of "Peanuts" as older people. At first, this was going to be put in the episode "Patriot Games", but that episode was too long to put it in.

The episode was watched in about 9.23 houses when it was first broadcast.

Dan Iverson from IGN said that the episode would make people who do not like "Family Guy" "laugh pretty hard." Iverson thought that it "won't be remembered as fondly as some of the episodes from the first few seasons." He thought the funniest part of the episode was showing how radio jockeys are "immature". Brett Love from TV Squad did not like the story with Peter, Thelma, and Tom. Love thought that the "Stewie and Brian stuff was the best part of the episode", but said that the episode was a "slow start to the season". Francis Rizzo from DVD Talk said that the story about radio is "a perfect parody of everything that's wrong in radio."

Passive smoking

Someone smoking a pipe or a cigarette will exhale tobacco smoke. People who are physically close to the smoker will inhale the smoke. This is called passive smoking. Even though passive smokers don't smoke themselves, they are still affected by the smoke. The effects of inhaling tobacco smoke are similar to those of smoking. These effects were first studied in the 1970s. Since then, many countries have made laws that limit who is allowed to smoke, and where smoking is allowed. As an example, many countries made laws that made smoking in restauarants illegal, to protect the staff against the effects of passive smoking.

Crime Crackers 2

Crime Crackers 2 is a video game developed by Media Vision and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation's Japanese 1997 video game.

"Crime Crackers 2" is a first-person shooter with role-playing elements.

Team Guppy are a group of what are known as "Crackers" -- skilled bounty hunters who make a living fighting against space pirates under contract from the Galactic Police. Team Guppy haven't been around long, and aren't particularly famous, so they don't get a whole lot of work. One day, they get a request from the Galactic Police to respond to a pirate attack on Jack Station, and they jump at the chance.

"Crime Crackers 2" is the sequel to Crime Crackers, and is again a first-person action game in a similar style. It takes place two years after the original, following a team of Crackers who got into the business after being inspired by Team Pink Dolphin, the heroes of the first game. Just like the previous title, the player must explore each area, defeating enemies and collecting items until they find and defeat the boss.

There are several changes to the system since the first title. The most significant is the elimination of action mode: The player can now always attack forward, giving the game a faster pace than its predecessor, but still more deliberate than, say, Doom. The team size has increased to four, and again each member has their own specific abilities, as well as their own life and weapon energy meters.

The game is otherwise quite similar to the first game. The story is driven through communication from the support team during missions, as well as in animated cutscenes between them. There is also the option to buy and sell items between missions. The game also features a branching storyline with numerous endings, and will even keep track of which branches the player has played through.

Bellman–Ford algorithm

In computer science, Bellman-Ford is an algorithm used to compute the shortest distances and paths from a single node within a graph to all other nodes.

It is more robust than Dijkstra's algorithm because it is able to handle graphs containing negative edge weights. It may be improved by noting that, if an iteration of the main loop of the algorithm completes without making any changes, the algorithm can be immediately completed, as future iterations will not make any changes. Its runtime is formula_1 time, where formula_2 and formula_3 are the number of nodes and edges respectively.

Timothy Quill

Timothy Quill (9 May 1901 – 10 June 1960) was an Irish Labour Party politician, farmer and a figure in the history of the cooperative movement in Ireland. He was a founder of the City of Cork Co-operative Society (also serving as the society's secretary), and was the editor of "The Cork Co-Operator" publication. He was also manager and secretary of the Cork Co-operative Bakery Society. He was an organiser for the Labour Party in Cork, a regional trade union secretary and one of a number of early Labour Dáil members to promote Christian socialism. Quill also served as a local councillor initially with Cork County Council from 1925 but served on both the County Council and Cork Corporation during the 1930s and 1940s. He also held positions on the executives of large agricultural organisations in later years.

Timothy Quill was born to Daniel and Mary Quill in Clondrohid, Macroom, County Cork, on 9 May 1901. He had five brothers. Initially living in Macroom, he moved to Cork City with his wife and young family, and in 1936 was living near Victoria Cross. Before his time in the co-operative movement, he was involved in the insurance business.

Quill was a regional trade union secretary for North-West Cork. Quill, along with TJ Murphy and Paddy Crowley MCC, have been credited with establishing "labourers' clubs" in County Cork during the 1920s and 1930s. The clubs would meet after Mass and some were supported by parish priests. The clubs began to go into decline in the 1940s as farm machinery became more commonplace.

Quill was elected a councillor on Cork County Council in 1925. It has been said that he was recruited into the party by Labour politician and fellow Clondrohid native T. J. Murphy. Quill was 26 years old at the time of the general election on 9 June 1927 and was one of 44 Labour candidates. While campaigning, Quill described himself as a "temperate man". At a meeting in North Cork, Quill outlined what he believed the Labour Party stood for. Referring to the level of unemployment, he spoke about the "right to work" and the government's perceived failing of "humbler people" over the "well-to-do class". Quill was elected as a Labour Party TD for the Cork North constituency receiving 18% of first preference votes. Slogans, such as 'Be Labour This Time' and 'Away With Slums & Mud Cabins' were featured on his election posters. He was the youngest member of the 5th Dail. He spoke against the Public Safety Bill 1927 in August 1927. During a finance committee debate on old age pensions in July 1927, he decried what he described as the "strict and harsh manner" of some pensions officers. Quill lost his seat at the September 1927 general election, serving only three months as a TD. He received 4,123 first preference votes. T. D. Keating of the ITGWU said that it was regrettable that Quill was not re-elected. The number of Labour candidates almost halved (from 44 to 28). Speaking on the heavy defeat for Labour in the September 1927 election, T. J. Murphy regretted that the party had lost candidates, like Quill, who he described as "young men of the ability and honesty of Mr. Quill, who had been defeated in North Cork by a mere handful of votes, after making a marvellous fight against a combination of influences".

Quill did not contest the 1932 general election, declining to stand at a convention in Millstreet, Cork. According to "The Southern Star", it was thought Quill would be the chosen candidate, but, according to the newspaper's columnist, had "to a certain extent, lost touch with the electors of this division and he declined to accept the honour". According to the "Cork Examiner" Quill declined the nomination and asked "that some other candidate […] be proposed". In a letter published in "The Southern Star" in June 1933, Quill labelled criticisms levelled against him and the Labour movement as 'ignorant'. As of 1936, he was Chairman of the Cork County Executive of the Labour Party. Quill contested the 1937 general election as a sitting city councillor on the Cork Corporation, as one of 23 Labour candidates, receiving 14.9% of first preference votes, but was not elected. He ran again in the 1938 general election, this time as one of 30 Labour candidates, receiving 4,950 first preference votes (12.6%), but was once again not elected. This was to be his last general election campaign, however he would remain as an elected city councillor on Cork Corporation.

According to "A Biographical Dictionary of Cork", by Tim Cadogan and Jeremiah Falvey, Quill served as a councillor on Cork County Council for two periods. As a Transport member, he was nominated and won a seat in 1925, retaining his seat in 1928 and lost the seat in 1934, before winning a seat again in 1942 and serving until 1945. He was elected to both the Cork County Council and the Cork Corporation that year. Quill was at one time Chair of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance. Quill also served as a city councillor with Cork Corporation. The City Councillor's 1920–1945 roll book seems to record that T Quill was elected in 1936. In 1939, he is listed as a member of the Labour Party's Cork Centre Branch. There was a local election in the city almost every year from 1929 to 1936 to elect portions of the city council and others in 1942 and 1945. Quill was a member of the South Cork Board of Public Health. He is still listed as a councillor in this book in 1944–1945. Quill served as Deputy Lord Mayor of Cork and on the Committee of Management of the South Infirmary.

In 1936, Quill said that “the Irish Labour Movement has its own road to travel and had no place for the cries of Fascism or Communism that plagued the world today.” 

During the 1940s, Quill became chair of the Liam Mellows Branch of the Labour Party. In this capacity he proved to be an enemy of Michael O'Riordan. The branch had been established by former members of the Curragh Camp's Communist Group. O'Riordan had retrospectively asserted that Quill was imposed as chair to ensure that Labour in Cork City could control the new branch. O'Riordan also stated that Quill had made an attack on what Quill "called 'the Jew boys' of Cork". It was during this time that the ITGWU had disaffiliated from the Labour Party and the National Labour Party was established on the basis that communists were infiltrating the party. A report in the "Irish Press" suggests that the Administrative Council "had become aware that certain persons in Cork were engaging in activities which appear to be inconsistent with their membership of the Labour Party and accordingly they appointed a subcommittee to investigate the membership and administration of the Liam Mellows Branch". O'Riordan's son, Manus, would later refer to Quill as an "anti-Semitic red-baiting villain" who was responsible for O'Riordan's expulsion.

During the 1920s, Quill established the City of Cork Co-operative Society with Con Desmond. This included social enterprises such as Cooperative Tea, Cooperative Cream and Cooperative Bread. He was also a member of the Cork Co-operators' Guild. He was also the editor of "The Cork Co-Operator", a monthly publication of the co-operative movement in Cork. In a letter to the editor, published on the cover of the June 1939 issue, Steve Denny (director of the London Co-operative Society) described "The Cork Co-Operator" as a "bright little paper". Quill frequently attended the Co-operative Congress in the UK throughout the 1930s and 1940s. Inspired by Robert Owen, he built cottages for the workers on his land. Quill regarded himself as a Christian Socialist. He resigned his position in the co-operative movement in 1954. These societies were defunct by the time of his death in 1960. In 2021, an article in "The Southern Star" described Quill as "an icon in the Irish co-operative movement".
He married Mary McCarthy on 7 January 1930.

In the 1940s, Quill lived at Ferney House in Blackrock, Cork, where he grew vegetables and kept livestock. His first trial of Holstein Friesian cattle took place here, and he owned what "The Southern Star" described as "one of the largest and most successful herds in the country". He was used as an example in an 1950s advertisement titled "Friesian T.T Herd Makes History", and served as the honorary secretary of the Irish Friesian Society. He served on the General Committee of the Munster Agricultural Society, wrote a farming column for "The Cork Examiner" and contributed to the "The Evening Echo" under the pen name Carrigeen.By the 1950s he had settled at a property near Blarney, left politics and was Chair of the Blarney National Farmer's Association. According to the "Irish Independent", Quill was the Chair of the Federation of Cow Testing Associations. He was also on the Committee of the Irish Landrace Pig Society.

He died on 10 June 1960, aged 59 and was buried in St. Finbarr's Cemetery. In an obituary published on 11 June 1960, the "Evening Echo" described him as an "authorative writer on agricultural matters". The Timothy Quill Perpetual Challenge Cup for the MAS (Munster Agricultural Society) Holstein Friesian Senior Cow Class at Cork Summer Show is named after him.

Yasuki Chiba (千葉泰樹, "Chiba Yasuki", June 24, 1910 - September 18, 1985) is a Japanese film director.

Chiba was born in the city of Changchun, Jilin Province during the late Qing Dynasty . After graduating from Kobe Commercial High School in 1928, he joined the Hanzuma Tachibana Universal Union Film as an assistant director. In 1929, Chiba would be latter transferred to the Kawai Movie Negamo Photo Studio and in 1930, directed his first film debut called "Aojiroki hitobito".

Around this time, Chiba began to work on many contemporary dramas, and then moved to Nanpo Movies to work on the problematic work "Renga jokô", which depicts the interaction between Japanese craftsmen living in slums and Koreans living in Japan.

This work was disapproved by censorship and also caused the dismantling of the Nanpo Movie (the movie was released in 1946 after the end of the war). During World War II, he worked with Daiei Tokyo Studios and became a freelance photographer in 1947, shooting his film ""Aru yoru no seppun"", which depicts the first kissing scene in the history of Japanese cinema.

Even after retiring as a director in 1969, he has supervised "Jump Out! Youth" and "We Are Youth!". Regarding the solid craftsmanship, producer Sanezumi Fujimoto of Toho, who has often appointed Chiba since the disappearance of the Nanpo movie, has a lot of trust, and Chiba after transferring to Toho is indispensable for Fujimoto's production work, became director after recovering his health. When Fujimoto compared Toho's film director to the batting order of the baseball team around 1964, Chiba was also listed as the number one batter in the 1st Army.

By the way, Mikio Naruse, Akira Kurosawa and Hiroshi Inagaki were assigned to the cleanup. It is also known that Chiba worked on a relentless serious drama that looks at the ugly parts of the real world, such as "Two Sons" and "Onibi", between the hit series that Toho made a company luck. In addition, "Meshi", which triggered the resurrection of Mikio Naruse, was originally supposed to be directed by Chiba, but it was directed by Naruse because Chiba got sick.

Shochiku

The Shochiku Company, Limited (松竹株式会社, "Shōchiku Kabushiki gaisha") is a Japanese movie studio, cinema chain, and production company for kabuki. It also produces and distributes anime films.

The company was founded in 1895 as a kabuki production company and later began producing films in 1920. Shochiku is considered the oldest company in Japan involved in present-day film production, but Nikkatsu began earlier as a pure film studio in 1912. Founded by the brothers Takejirō Ōtani (大谷竹次郎) and Matsujirō Shirai (白井松次郎), it was named “Matsutake” in 1902 after the combined "kunyomi" reading of the "kanji" "take" (bamboo) and "matsu" (pine) from their names, reflecting the traditional three symbols of happiness: bamboo, pine, and plum. The "onyomi" reading of Shōchiku first appeared in 1920 with the founding of the film production subsidiary "Shōchiku Kinema Gōmei-sha".

Shochiku grew quickly in the early years, expanding its business to many other Japanese live theatrical styles, including "Noh" and "Bunraku", and established a near monopoly due to its ownership of theaters, as well as "kabuki" and "shimpa" drama troupes.

The company began making films in 1920, about a decade after its main rival Nikkatsu. The company sought to break away from the prevailing pattern of "jidai-geki" and to emulate Hollywood standards. It was the first film studio to abandon the use of female impersonators and brought new ideas, including the star system and the sound stage to Japan. It built its main studio at Kamata, between Tokyo and Yokohama, and hired Henry Kotani, a Japanese who had worked in Hollywood as an actor and cameraman to direct its first film, "Island Woman" ("Shima no Onna", 1920). It also hired the prominent theater director Kaoru Osanai to head a school at the studio, which produced the film "Souls on the Road" (1921), a film directed by Minoru Murata which is considered "the first landmark film in Japanese history".

However, Shochiku's early history was difficult, as audiences preferred the more action-packed "jidai-geki" historical swashbucklers over the shinpa melodramas, and its Kamata studios were destroyed by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, forcing a temporary relocation to Kyoto.

With the reopening of its Kamata studios, Shochiku also introduced the "shomin-geki" genre, with stories reflecting the lives of the lower-middle urban classes. These dramas proved immensely popular, and marked the start of the careers of many prominent directors (including Ozu, Naruse, and Hiroshi Shimizu) and actors (including Kinuyo Tanaka).

In 1931, Shochiku released the first “talkie” made in Japan: "The Neighbor's Wife and Mine" "(Madamu to nyōbō", 1930). Filming became increasing difficult at the Kamata studios during the 1930s with the rapid industrialization of the surrounding area with munitions factories and metal foundries, and Shochiku decided to close the studio and relocate to Ofuna, near Kamakura in 1936. The following year, Shochiku Kinema was merged with its parent company, Shochiku Entertainment, and adopted the new name of Shochiku Corporation.

During the World War II, Shochiku's President, Shiro Kido, helped establish the Dai Nippon Eiga Kyokai (Greater Japan Film Association), whose purpose was to coordinate the industry's efforts with Japanese government policy. From the mid-1930s until 1945, the films produced by Shochiku and other Japanese movie companies were propagandistic. After the surrender of Japan, Kido and Shochiku's co-founder Otani were arrested and charged with Class-A war crimes by the Allied occupation authorities.

In 1953, after the end of the occupation, Kido returned to Shochiku and revived the melodramatic style of films which had been a Shochiku trademark in the pre-war era. Directors associated with Shochiku in this era included Ozu, Keisuke Kinoshita, and Noboru Nakamura. Many of the films during the 1950s were aimed primarily at female audiences. In particular, Hideo Oba's three-part "What is Your Name?" ("Kimi no na wa?") in 1953 was the most commercially successful film of the period. Ozu's "Tokyo Story", made in 1953, later earned considerable accolades, being selected in the 2012 Sight & Sound international critics poll as the third best film of all time.

By the start of the 1960s, Shochiku's films were criticized as “old-fashioned” with the popularity of rival Nikkatsu’s "Taiyo-zoku" youth-orientated movies. The studio responded by launching the Japanese New Wave ("Nuberu bagu") which also launched the career of Nagisa Oshima among others, though Oshima soon went independent; the films of Oshima and other film makers were not financially successful and the company changed its policies.

However, the growing threat from television led to the bankruptcy of Shochiku’s competitors, Shintoho in 1961 and Daiei in 1971, whereas Nikkatsu and Toei turned to movies and soft pornography to maintain attendance. Shochiku continued to maintain its family-orientated audience largely due to the phenomenal success of the "Otoko wa Tsurai yo" series directed by Yoji Yamada from 1969 through 1997. However, with the death of its star Kiyoshi Atsumi, the series came to an end, and the company faced increasing financial difficulties.

The Ofuna studio was briefly transformed into a theme park, Kamakura Cinema World, but this was closed in 1998 and the site was sold off in 2000 to Kamakura Women's College. Since that time, Shochiku has relied on its film studio and backlot in Kyoto. Yamada’s “The Twilight Samurai” ("Tasogare Seibei", 2002) was nominated for an Oscar as Best Foreign Language Picture.

Shintoho

Shintoho Company, Limited ( l"New Toho Co., Ltd.") was a short-lived Japanese film studio. It was founded by defectors from Toho in 1947 and was financed by Daiei. In 1961, Shintoho declared bankruptcy and a successor was founded the same year, named Shintoho Eiga, which went on to specialize in pink films.

Shintoho is considered to be one of the 6 major film studios active during the 1950s' "Golden Age of Japanese Cinema", which also included Toho, Daiei, Nikkatsu, Shochiku, and Toei.

Founded in 1947 as an offshoot of Toho after the major company had become struck with labor turmoil, Shintoho began its short existence producing such films as "", which was later distributed by Toho, and "". However, the company found itself to be outflanked by other much larger studios and appointed Mitsugu Okura as its new top executive in 1955 to guide the company toward better things. Under the guidance of Okura, Shintoho began producing such works as the critically acclaimed , , a slew of pink films, and a number of films centered around the supernatural among a handful of others.

In May of 1961, Shintoho declared bankruptcy and two new companies were formed to take its place. Mitsugu Okura, Shintoho's former president, created the studio after purchasing Shintoho's production facilities in Tokyo. At this time Koichi Goto, a former Shintoho employee, purchased the rights to the Shintoho name and 3 years later established Shintoho Entertainment. In 1972, this new company relocated from Osaka to Tokyo and absorbed another piece of the original Shintoho, as well as receiving a new name: "Shintoho Eiga". Shintoho Eiga also later went on to distribute a number of Shintoho's films and former director for Shintoho, Kiyoshi Komori, began directing pink films for Shintoho Eiga in 1964 until his retirement in the 1970s.

Dialectical materialism

Dialectical materialism is a philosophy of science, history, and nature. It was developed in Europe and is based on the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Marxist dialectics say that real-world conditions such as class, labor, and socioeconomic interactions are important. This is a contrast to Hegelian dialectic, which says that contradictions in material phenomena can be resolved by analyzing them and finding a solution. Marx thought that the most effective solution to the problems caused by such contradictory phenomena was to address and rearrange the systems of social organization at the root of the problems.

Dialectical materialism accepts that the natural world changes. New qualities of being will come to light with each change. As Z. A. Jordan noted, "Engels made constant use of the metaphysical insight that the higher level of existence emerges from and has its roots in the lower; that the higher level constitutes a new order of being with its irreducible laws; and that this process of evolutionary advance is governed by laws of development which reflect basic properties of 'matter in motion as a whole'."

The formulation of the Soviet version of dialectical and historical materialism in the 1930s by Joseph Stalin and his associates (such as in Stalin's book "Dialectical and Historical Materialism") became the official Soviet interpretation of Marxism.

Nekketsu Oyako

Nekketsu Oyako (熱血親子) is a Beat 'em up video game developed and published by TechnoSoft released on December 3, 1994 for the Sony PlayStation. In Sega Saturn version It was developed by TechnoSoft published by Sega released on July 21, 1995 for the Sega Saturn. In PlayStation Network was released on September 27, 2017 with console.

Nekketsu Oyako (roughly translated as Thermal blooded parent and child) is a side scrolling beat 'em up like Final Fight that was one of the original launch titles for the PlayStation in Japan back in December 1994. It was later ported to the Sega Saturn several months later with a few minor changes.

The game was basically a technical demo to show how the PlayStation could handle an arcade style 2D game filled with many on-screen sprites and some 3D sprite scaling. It was never released outside of Japan, and is considered to be on the rare side for both consoles, as the game was never reprinted.

In the not to distant future, a conglomerate known as the Big Black Corporation is up to no good, and the Hibino family venture on a journey to the Big Black Tower to rescue Rando's wife, who has been kidnappned by Mr. Herograw (the head of the company, and the main villan).

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PLAYSTATION & SATURN VERSIONS:

- The Sega Saturn version does not use translucent textures for see-through effects. Instead, you see a cross hatch pattern effect that looks somewhat grainy, but does the job.

- In the PlayStation version, it is possible to gain more health than 100%. This appears to have been removed in the Saturn game, altering the difficulty to a degree.

- The loading times are slightly longer on the Saturn, causing a 'Now Loading' screen between scenery. However, the difference in time is only a few seconds more.

- The soundtrack on the Sega Saturn version is slightly remixed and sounds like it was remastered on a Midi synthesizer, and it can be played back by putting the disc in an Audio CD player. The original PlayStation version appears to be played through the PlayStation's internal audio mixer, and the music does not restart when the game is paused, as is the case on the Saturn.

- Rando's burning montage on the Sega Saturn intro shows a different diffusion effect.

- The 3D Technosoft logo screen appears to move slightly sluggish on the Saturn port.

- The enemy VanDamme is bald on the Saturn version.

- In the first act of Stage 2, the Saturn version has an added scrolling layer that obscures part of the playfield view.

- The World Start screen shows a zoomed in view of the playfield on the Saturn, as opposed to a portrait of the playfield on a coloured chessboard.

- As expected, The bonus item PlayStation console is replaced by a Sega Saturn in the Saturn port.

Securities fraud

Securities fraud, also known as investment fraud or stock fraud, refers to when a deceptive practice in a stock market or commodity market is committed. The deceptive practice leads investors to make purchasing or sale decisions under false information. That usually means losses in violation of securities laws.

Examples of securities fraud include insider trading, the Ponzi scheme, Internet fraud and corporate fraud.

Any investor can become a victim. However, it usually happens to those age fifty or older. It not only happens to investors, it happens to creditors, employees and taxing authorities.

Diet in diabetes

Diet in diabetes refers to eating patterns by those with diabetes mellitus. For overweight or obese people who have diabetes or prediabetes, the most important aspect with a diet is it means the loss of the diabetic's body fat. Losing body fat is proven to improve blood sugar control and lower the insulin levels.

People with diabetes can eat almost anything they want in moderation. However, a diet with some carbohydrates is best. Diabetics should avoid or limit soft drinks and juices. For people who use insulin (all type 1 and some type 2), eating a right amount of carbohydrate makes managing blood sugar easier.

The most recommended diet for diabetics by dietitians is one which is high in fiber, low in sugar, low in saturated fat and has "no" trans fat. The American Diabetes Association, however, recommends against eating more fiber than needed. That's because this may case digestive problems, like diarrhea, flatulence and bloating.

Rampur, Himachal Pradesh

Rampur Bushahr is a town and a municipal council in Shimla district in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. It is about 130 km from Shimla and is well connected with NH 5 which passes through Theog, Narkanda and Kumarsain.

The principality of Bushahr (also known as Bashahar, Bushahar, Bashahr) was once among the largest of the twenty-eight Shimla Hill States under the administration of the British Raj keen to invest on regional and transcontinental trade and exploit Himalayan resources. Caught in one of the British imperial enterprise, it was subjected to political-cum-economic vicissitudes, acceding to the Indian Union in 1947. On 8 March 1948, along with twenty other princely hill States of Punjab and Shimla, Bashahr signed an agreement which resulted in its inclusion in the Indian State of Himachal Pradesh.

Rampur, a small township situated at 1,005 meters on the left bank of the Sutlej, served as Bushahar's winter capital. Being well connected with major trading routes that joined Indian markets with Central Asia and Tibet, it buzzed with mercantile activity, especially in November during the Lavi fair, the largest trading event in the north Himalayas attracting traders from Kashmir, Ladakh, Yarkand, and the Indian mainland. Concerning the origins of the Rampuri fair, the Census of India (1961) reports:

""About three hundred years ago during the regime of Raja Kehar Singh of Bushahr, a trade treaty was signed between the Bushahr State and Tibet…Horses from Tibet and swords from Bushahr were exchanged in token of this friendship. It was written in the treaty that their friendly relations would continue till this time…Since then, it is presumed that trade relations increased and eventually [the] Lavi fair was held.""

Rampur was also located along pilgrimage routes to sacred sites in western Tibet shared by Hindus, Bön and Buddhists alike, i.e., Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar. Missionary and pilgrimage activities, intensified by trading possibilities, created the conditions for Tibetan Buddhism to take a firm stronghold in these borderland regions. Twenty-two kilometres from the village of Namgya in upper Kinnaur, laid the Shipki pass which linked caravan routes to and from western Tibet. This treacherous transcontinental passage must have been in use from ancient times, for among the ruined castles reported by Francke at Shipki village, there were no living memories of the origins of mKar gog, the oldest of them built above the village in cyclopean style. Rampur also has Hydro Power Stations namely, Nathpa Jhakri Power Station (1500 MW) and Rampur Hydro Power Station (412 MW) by SJVN Ltd. A second castle, known as Seng ge mkhar, is said to have received its crooked ground plan “through a race round its base executed in opposite directions by a poisonous snake and a scorpion,” and was built, in all probability, during the Ladakhi occupation of mNga’ ris by orders of King Seng ge rnam rgyal (1570–1642) and called after him. 

Rampur is located at . It has an average elevation of 1021 metres (4429 feet). It is a very beautiful place situated at the bank of the Satluj river. It borders on the north with Spiti, on the west with Kumarsain and Anni, on the east with Kinnaur and on the south with Rohru. The city is nearby to popular places like Jhakri, Sarahan Bushahr, Green valley Dhar Gaura and Shraikoti to name a few. The city is also the home to Asia's Largest underground Hydro Power Project - The Nathpa Jhakri Hydro Power Station built by Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Ltd (formerly known as Nathpa Jhakri Power Corporation) at Jhakri with dam sight at nathpa in Kinnaur and world's deepest Surge shaft at a Shah (22 km from Rampur). 


Daniel Sanfourche said de Lamothe

Fortune Street (video game)

Fortune Street (known as Boom Street in Europe and Oceania) is a Wii game developed by Square Enix. It is a follow-up to the 2007 Nintendo DS game Itadaki Street DS and is the first Itadaki Street title that was released outside of Japan.

This game was able to be played over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection; however, the service was terminated on May 20, 2014, making this game no longer playable online. Also, mainly due to this game's Wi-Fi compatibilities, it is impossible to transfer the save data to an SD Card.

This game functions like a Monopoly style board game. It can be played with up to four players. If game data can't be saved or won't be saved, only offline multiplayer is available (though Out to Lunch can be used to mimic a single player game. Every player can be CPU players by doing this). When playing multiplayer offline, records aren't saved. Also, when playing multiplayer offline, players can decide if each player should have their own Wii Remote, or that players share one Wii Remote. When using the latter option, players will press one of the three buttons: ,  and  during an Auction to make a bid, and are ordered based on where characters appear in the Auction window.

At the start of a game, all players use number machines to determine the turn order, with the highest number going first (note that it is possible for two numbers on the number machines to be the same, if so then the tying players use the number machines again). The only exceptions are the tutorial, where the human player always goes first; and in Custom Rules, should the Order of play be set to As picked, where it makes P1 goes first, then P2, then P3, then P4.

Four players (excluding the play system in Tutorial mode, where only three characters play) take turns by rolling dice to go around the board and buy shops. Some squares involve special attributes, such as Take-a-break squares (when a character lands there, all of their shops will close until the player's next turn) and Venture squares (like a Chance space in Monopoly). Players also have the ability to invest money in their own shops when they land on them (a maximum of 999 per turn). Scattered around the board are four suits (Spade, Heart, Diamond, and Club); if the player collects all of them and returns to the Bank (also the starting square) they get a promotion. When a player gets a promotion, they get a fixed amount for their salary, plus a shop bonus which is based off 10% the sum of all the player's shop value, as well as a promotional bonus (extra money given to the player that increases as they level up). The player's level also goes up when they get a promotion.

The player wins by increasing their net worth to at least the target amount (usually determined by the game, if on Custom mode though, this can range between 6,000 and 999,000 in increments of 1,000) and returning to the bank first (in the Practice Boards, the target net worth for Easy Rules and Standard Rules are 5,000 G and 8,000 G respectively). Net worth is the total combined amount of ready cash and value in stocks and shops and can be increased by having other players land on their shops and buying multiple shops in an area or investing in stocks and owned shops to increase the stock price. If the player runs out of ready cash at any point, they must sell either stocks or a shop to try and get out of debt; any shops sold for cash are auctioned (the winning bid gets paid to the bank). Note that the bank only offers 75% of the shop price to a player if they are in debt. Also, if a player auctions a shop from "Manage Shops" or gets Venture Card #74, the highest bid is credited to the original owner. If the player's net worth goes below zero, then they go bankrupt; all their assets are sold off if any remain and they are automatically eliminated from the game. The player with the highest net worth automatically wins if the bankruptcy limit is met (although in a very rare case should two or more players have the same highest net worth, the player that goes later in the turn order wins). In Tour mode, the game ends once one player goes bankrupt, in Custom mode, this can be set to when two players go bankrupt or to have a last-man-standing rule.

Characters have expansive dialogue and interact with each other

All 22 characters from Itadaki Street DS return, with the addition of four new characters for a grand total of 26. Players can also use and customize their Miis in the game.

Miis are the only playable characters in single-player and online mode; in multiplayer offline, players can also choose between the Mario and Dragon Quest characters as well. Each computer character is ranked from S, A, B, C, D in terms of difficulty (S being the highest, and D being the lowest) which means each computer character has a predetermined difficulty. If the player beats either all the Easy Tour boards or all the Standard Tour boards, they will have the ability to switch the computers' difficulty from S rank to their normal rank.

Itadaki Street DS

Itadaki Street DS (いただきストリートDS, lit. "Top Street DS") is a game for the Nintendo DS. It was created by Square Enix. Like other installments in the Itadaki Street series, "Itadaki Street DS" is a Monopoly-like game that has some Mario Party-esque elements added to it due to the appearance of several Mario characters (minigames, for example). It was released on June 21, 2007 only in Japan.

A follow-up to this game, titled Fortune Street was released for the Wii in December 2011.

Players move around the board, buying shops and collecting money from others who land on their shop spaces. Depending on circumstances, some players can forcibly take over another player's shop spaces, or make them inactive for a turn. Players can also hold shares of a block of spaces so that they get paid when someone lands on any space in that block, even if it is not their own.

Players get bonuses for leveling up, which is done by passing four special spaces on the board (each marked with a suit- Club, Diamond, Heart, and Spade) and then going to the Bank space. If the player lands on one of these special spaces instead of passing them, they get a chance to randomly draw a "chance card", which affects gameplay or a player. Usually, the goal is to reach a certain total property value and get to the Bank, or to make a player bankrupt. There is also a special "Casino" space where themed games of chance occur.

There are 23 playable characters in Itadaki Street DS (if the male and female avatars are counted as one character): Eleven from the Mario series and eleven from the Dragon Quest series. Players are also able to create and customize their own characters that can be played as. Although only four of the characters from both series are playable to begin with, the others can be unlocked by playing through the Tour Mode of the game. Additionally, there are also three Support/Guest characters that players can summon with the help of a card, but are not playable.

Support/Guest Characters

Lakitu (shuts down spaces he passes or lands on for one turn)

Healslime (gives marks necessary for leveling up when player passes it)

Dancing Jewels/GoodyBag (pays out to the owner of any space it lands on)

The theme "Hello, Happy Kingdom" from "" is featured in this game's tutorial level.

This is one of the few games where Mario has written dialogue.

Habesha peoples

Habesha peoples (; ; ; etymologically related to English exonyms "Abyssinia" and "Abyssinians" by way of Latin) in its most general sense is a community and supra-ethnic identifier among Eritreans, Ethiopians, and their descendants in the diaspora. The identifier has a diverse array of usage depending on situational context, cultural perspective, socio-political ideology, geographic location, point of view, and era in time, among other influences.

In one sense, Habesha has historically been used as a meta-ethnicity to refer to peoples found in the highlands of Ethiopia and Eritrea between Asmara and Addis Ababa of largely Ethiosemitic language-speaking populations (e.g. the modern-day Amhara, Tigrayan, Tigrinya peoples, among others) as well as in some cases including Central Cushitic language-speaking peoples (e.g. the modern-day Agaw, Qemant, Bilen, Awi), all of which have had constant contact with each other and share ethnic homelands within the Ethiopian Highlands and Eritrean Highlands geographic area.

In another sense, Habesha as a pan-ethnicity is used in reference to all Ethiopians and Eritreans, encompassing all constituent ethnic groups, and their diaspora populations, within a transnational cultural mosaic community consisting of the peoples, cultures, and products of Ethiopia, Eritrea, and the cultural practices adopted by diaspora populations in the countries in which they have migrated to. The concept of Habesha as a pan-ethnicity is largely held by diaspora communities as well as among people in urban centers in the highlands of Ethiopia and Eritrea between Asmara and Addis Ababa (especially those with access to social media).

Historically, the term "Habesha" represented northern Ethiopian Highlands which consisted of populations that are predominantly Orthodox Tewahedo Christians, while the Oromo and other ethnic groups, as well as Semitic-speaking Muslims, were considered the periphery. Its is frequently employed to refer to Semitic language-speaking peoples mainly found in the highlands of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Historically, the term was applied to predominantly Christian groups, and this usage remains common today. The term is used in varying degrees of exclusion and inclusivity: Most commonly, it includes all highland Semitic language-speaking Christians; sometimes it is employed in an expanded sense to include Muslim communities as well as Christians. At the extremes, the term is currently sometimes employed in a restrictive sense to only refer to speakers of Tigrinya, while recently, some within diasporic communities have adopted the term to refer to all people of Eritrean or Ethiopian origin. 

According to Gerard Prunier, one very restrictive use of the term today by some Tigrayans refers exclusively to speakers of Tigrinya, however it is noteworthy that Tigrayan oral traditions and linguistic evidence bear witness to ancient and constant relations with Amharas. Some Gurage societies, such as Orthodox Christian communities where Soddo is spoken, identify as Habesha and have a strong sense of Ethiopian national identity, due in part to their ancient ties with the northern Habesha.

Predominately Muslim ethnic groups in the Eritrean Highlands such as the Tigre have historically opposed the name Habesha; Muslim Tigrinya-speakers are usually referred to as Jeberti people while in some records Jebarti is described as a Muslim ethno-religious sub-group or alternative to Habesha. At the turn of the 20th century, elites of the Solomonic dynasty employed the conversion of various ethnic groups to Orthodox Tewahedo Christianity and the imposition of the Amharic language to spread a common Habesha national identity.

Within Ethiopian and Eritrean diasporic populations, some second generation immigrants have adopted the term "Habesha" in a broader sense as a supra-national ethnic identifier inclusive of all Eritreans and Ethiopians. For those who employ the term, it serves as a useful counter to more exclusionary identities such as "Amhara" or "Tigrayan". However, this usage is not uncontested: On the one hand, those who grew up in Ethiopia or Eritrea may object to the obscuring of national specificity. On the other hand, groups that were subjugated in Ethiopia or Eritrea sometimes find the term offensive.

The modern term derives from Semitic languages: , first written in unvowelled script as ; ; . The earliest known use of the term dates to the second or third century Sabaean inscription recounting the defeat of the "nəgus" ("king") GDRT of Aksum and ḤBŠT. The early Semitic term appears to refer to a group of peoples, rather than a specific ethnicity.

Egyptian inscriptions refer to the people that they traded with in Punt as , "the bearded ones." Francis Breyer believes the Egyptian demonym to be the source of the Semitic term.

The first attestation of late Latin "Abissensis" is from the fifth century CE. Modern Western European languages, including English, appear to borrow this term from the post-classical form "Abissini" in the mid-sixteenth century. (English "Abyssin" is attested from 1576, and "Abissinia" and "Abyssinia" from the 1620s.)

Lesser tree frog

The Guianan dwarf tree frog or lesser tree frog ("Dendropsophus minutus") is a frog that lives in the Guianas, Colombia, Trinidad, Venezuela, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, Peru, Argentina, and Brazil. It lives in a very large part of South America. Scientists have seen it as high as 2000 meters above sea level and as low as at sea level.

The male frogs sing for the female frogs from grass and shrubs near water and from plants growing up out of the water. Male frogs will fight each other over the best places to sing. The females lay eggs in water that does not move, like ponds and puddles.

This frog lives in a very large part of South America, in places that are very different from each other, so the individual frogs are also different from each other. In 2014, a team of 30 scientists studied the mtDNA of this frog and found the whole species had 47 different groups in it.

Arc length

Arc length is the distance along the arc/curve, denoted by "S", the target arc can be denoted by"L" or "formula_1", not the distance between its endpoints, which is known as the chord length and is denoted by "C".

Not all curves can be defining length, curves that can be defined by the length are called the rectifiable curves.

Depending on the given, there are two different ways to find the Arc Length.

Arc length on a circle can be measured as Arc length = s = θ/360 of 2πr = θ/360 × 2πr = rθ × π/180. (θ represents the degree of the ,"r" represents the Radius of the circle).

Arc length on a circle can be measured as Arc length= s = r × θ
The original method for calculating the arc length involves dividing the arc into many parts to obtain an estimated answer:

Missions of California

The California missions were made by Spain and were located in Alta California, now known as just California. The purpose of these missions were to bring Christianity to the natives. Many of the cities you see today in California are named after the missions. Spain sent priests and soldiers to build the missions. The leader of the priests was Junipero Serra. They often used violence to force the natives into helping to build their missions. Other times they would bribe the natives, promising to give them spices and money. The natives were forced to stay at the missions until their training was complete. As a result, many natives tried to escape. These natives were brought back to the mission, beaten, and punished. The soldiers would often beat the natives in public to show the natives what would be done if they didn't follow the rules. The end of the mission era in Alta California was after Mexico was finally free from Spain. Mexico decided that they would close down the missions. Today, the missions of California are used as wedding places, churches, and museums.

The 21 missions of California are listed in order by the date that they were made.

Cyborg 009 (1966 film)

Cyborg 009 (サイボーグ009, "Saibôgu 009") is a 1966 Japanese animated sci-fi adventure film loosely based on the by . It was directed by Yugo Serikawa, with the screenplay written by Takashi Iijima and Serikawa. It was released on July 21st, 1966, with a runtime of 64 minutes. It is a loose adaptation of the introductory arc, "Birth".

The earliest signs of the film's production can be seen in some early 1966 concept art by Ishinomori, done after discussions with the film planner Yoshifumi Hatano and the changes that the production team planned to make to the characters.

Many aspects were to be significantly altered in the movie, some to the frustration of Ishinomori. The most notable change that had disappointed him had involved Cyborg 007 being changed to be a young nine-year old boy, in order for the film to better appeal to the child audience. However, it was a compromise that had to be made, under the logic that it was much easier to empathize with a child character. The child 007 can be seen in this concept art, and would be previewed in the January 1966 one-shot "The Man in the High Castle". A redesign for 001 would also be depicted there, with his bangs no longer covering his eyes.

Shortly before the film's release, as the Cyborg 009 feature moved to , Ishinomori had to draw up a new origin story for film viewers who would be reading the magazine, although it was not intended to be canon with the upcoming "Underground Empire of Yomi" arc. This story, "Prologue", was a brief origin story taking cues from some parts of this film.

Other notable changes in the film included the removal of the biracial angle to 009, as well as him being changed from a delinquent to a race car driver captured by Black Ghost. 003 would also be depicted as a ballerina in her backstory, which would be carried forth to further incarnations.

After a sabotage on the race track that causes the #9 car driven by the racer "Hurricane" Joe Shimamura to crash, an ambulance arrives on the scene to take him away. But this ambulance is in actuality a decoy sent by the Black Ghost organization, the ones responsible for the wreck, while a real ambulance arrives too late.

In being taken to the Black Ghost base, Joe is found to have gone into cardiac arrest, being clinically dead and necessitating the replacement of his heart, and the Black Ghost scientists set to work on remodeling the rest of his body.

Joe awakens later on in a strange white uniform, but is quickly put through endurance tests, eventually winding up in the ocean and emerging to find the scientists congratulating him. He is introduced to eight other cyborgs of the 00 prototype line, who quickly announce their plans to rebel and bring a captive, Dr. Gilmore, along.

Joe, now called "009", soon learns that Gilmore had organized this rebellion with the cyborgs and that Black Ghost made them as weapons to profit off of war. The cyborgs must fight off the Black Ghost fleet following them in the getaway plane, as 003 introduces 009 to each team member and describes their power.

The team land on a deserted island, but soon find their plane blown up by robotic dinosaurs and must face other threats. 009, 007, and 008 take to the sea to take one of the Black Ghost submarines hostage, and the team manage to escape to freedom- for a time.

At Dr. Gilmore's research center, the cyborgs attempt to get used to being on the run and living away from their home countries. 003 tells 009 of her past, in how her parents were killed in a war and how Black Ghost ruined her life further. It is found that Black Ghost still has a base that the cyborgs must destroy, and 009 opts to take only 003, 006, and 007 along with him.

In the area surrounding the base, 009, 006, and 007 fight off against a spider-shaped mecha, while 003 is abducted and put on an operating table to be re-programmed against the other cyborgs. As the others enter the base and fight off against the soldiers, they find the newly evil 003 waiting for them and attempting to shoot them. 009 then discovers that the true leader of Black Ghost is a brain inside a machine, and shoots at it, causing the brainwashing on 003 to be broken. But with the base set to explode, they must escape.

Outside, as they attempt to get back to their ship, they find more Black Ghost soldiers waiting- along with the other 00 cyborgs, who have come just in time to shoot the soldiers and assist their teammates. The nine cyborgs narrowly escape the exploding island.

In the end, the nine stand in civilian clothing (and 003 holding 001), as for the time, they can now go back to their average lives and have peace from Black Ghost.

Corn smut

Corn smut is a disease that affects corn, which is also called maize. The fungus "Ustilago maydis" causes corn smut.

Lumps of growing tissue called galls grow on the corn. They can grow on the ears, leaves or stalks. Corn is more likely to have corn smut if it has been cut by machines or hailstones.

Farmers can stop corn smut by using corn that has been bred to be strong against the fungus. They can also stop corn smut by crop rotation. This is because the fungus can wait in the soil over the winter for the next crop. If the corn is not in the same field each year, it is harder for corn smut to reach new corn plants.

Corn smut is safe to eat, and chefs cook it.

Isomerization is a thing that happens to molecules and parts of molecules.

Isomerization is when a molecule or part of a molecule changes shape but still has the same number of each kind of atom. The atoms change places, but they do not go away. No new atoms come.

For example, when a ketose group changes to an aldose group, that is isomerization because both groups are -CHO. They have two carbon atoms, three hydrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms. In the ketose group, the first carbon has a double bond to an oxygen and a single bond to the other carbon. In the aldose group, the second carbon has the double bond to the oxygen, and the hydrogen atoms are in different places. But they both have the same number of each kind of atom.

Notably, modern day Sanamahist matrimonial practices are in fact, the original true traditional Meitei wedding without the influence of foreign culture.
No matter what religion one follows, the Meiteis are not allowed to marry between the persons of the same salai (clan). Else, severe punishment or banishment from the society (colony) is the usual result in Meitei culture.
Generally, in urban areas, monogamy is common while in rural areas, polygamy is not rare.

The marriage process usually starts with the meeting between the couple's families and the consultation on the two's horoscopes. If everything is fine, the marriage day will be fixed and finally, the partners will be wedded.

Regarding the cultural diversity of the Meitei ethnicity, there are the adherents of Sanamahism and Hinduism.
During early times, there were strong religious barriers between the castes inside the Meitei ethnicity. For instance, a general Meitei (either Hindu or Sanamahist) cannot marry a person who belongs to Meitei Pangals (Manipuri Muslims) or other communities.

In the traditional Meitei marriage ceremony, brides do not wear potloi. Instead, they wear phanek (traditional Meitei sarong) and Kajenglei (traditional Meitei headdress). Besides, the sacred chantings will all be done in Classical Meitei language.

In the Meitei Hindu marriage, brides wear potloi instead of phanek. Besides, many of the sacred chantings are performed in Sanskrit in addition to Classical Manipuri language.
Since Hinduism among the Meitei ethnicity is actually brought from the Vaishnavism of Bengal, the Meitei Hindus somehow imitate and follow the traditional matrimonial styles of the Bengalis.

City of London swords

The City of London swords are five swords that the City of London has for special occasions. They are the Mourning Sword (or Black Sword), the Pearl Sword, the State Sword (or Sunday Sword), the Old Bailey Sword and the Mansion House Justice Room Sword. When the Lord Mayor goes outside the City of London sometimes he or she takes the Travelling Sword of State, which is different from the State Sword. They are kept at Mansion House, where the Lord Mayor of London lives.

The Mourning Sword is used for funerals and related events. It has also been known as the Black Sword and the Lenten Sword. The facts behind the sword's history are unclear; however, speculations have been made. "The Telegraph" says some people think it is from the 16th century and that it might have been found in the River Thames. More than one sword has been used as the Mourning Sword. 

Samuel Pepys wrote about this sword in his diary on September 1663. He is writing about talking to Anthony Bateman, who was the Lord Mayor:

Writing about that part of Pepys' diary, Henry Benjamin Wheatley says that William St John Hope says places like the City of London have had simple, black swords for this reason for a long time. He also says that the blade of the sword is old but the rest of it is newer.

In "Ceremonial Swords of Britain: State and Civic Swords" (2017), Edward Barrett says that the Mourning Sword they have now is from 1615 or 1623. It has a blade long and wide, and a hilt.

Lord Mayor Roger Gifford carried the Mourning Sword at the funeral of Margaret Thatcher in 2013. He led the Queen and Prince Philip in and out of St Paul's Cathedral. The last time it was used at a funeral before that was in 1965 for Winston Churchill. It is also used on Good Friday, feast days and the anniversary of the Great Fire of London.

The Pearl Sword is supposed to have been given to the City of London Corporation by Elizabeth I of England in 1571 when the Royal Exchange was opened. The Pearl Sword derives its name from the roughly 2,500 pearls on the scabbard. Wheatley says that Hope says it might not be from 1571, but from 1554 or 1555.

Its blade is long and wide, and it has a hilt. It weighs without the scabbard. The first of the blade have been made blue and scratched with pictures of fruit, arrows, a ship and other things. Its scabbard is from at least as long ago as 1808.

When the Queen comes to the City in State, she is met at the border between the City and Westminster, where Temple Bar used to be, by the Lord Mayor of London. He offers her the sword to touch. Before 1641, the king or queen would take the sword and keep it while they were in the City. In 1641 Charles I gave it back to the Lord Mayor instead of keeping it for himself during his travels, and from that point forward this became the new tradition. This ceremony traces its roots to 1215, when the Mayor (now the Lord Mayor) began to be elected. 

When George III became king on 22 September 1761, they had to use the Pearl Sword because someone forgot to bring the royal Sword of State.

Lord Montbatten wrote in his diary that Queen Elizabeth was going to hit Idi Amin on the head with the pearl sword if he came to her Silver Jubilee (when she had been Queen for 25 years) in 1977. She was probably joking. It was used at her Diamond Jubilee (60 years). It was also used at her 90th official birthday.

The State Sword is one half of the Sword and Mace. Thye are symbols of the authority of the Lord Mayor and the City of London Corporation. It is carried by the Sword Bearer. The mace is carried by the Serjeant-at-Arms. The City of London has had a Sword of State since before 1373. The first known sword-bearer of the City was John Blytone. He left the job in 1395. The current sword is from the middle of the 17th century. It is also called the Sunday Sword. It was made in about 1670.

The blade is long and wide. The hilt is long and it weighs without the scabbard. It used to have a blue and gold pattern on the blade but that has worn off.

Because the State Sword is so valuable, it isn't taken outside the City of London. Instead there is a Travelling State Sword. It looks the same but it is lighter and slightly longer. It was made by Wilkinson Sword in 1962 and given to the City by Lord Mayor Sir Ralph Perring. 

It was first taken out of the country to Canada in 1963 by Ralph Perring.

The Old Bailey Sword stays at the Old Bailey, which is one of the buildings of the Crown Court in London. It is on the wall behind the most senior judge. The Cutlers' Society says it was made by Richard Mathew in 1562 or 1563 and given to the City in 1563. 

It has a blade long and wide, and an hilt. It weighs without the scabbard. It has some decorations on the blade, like the Pearl Sword. The scabbard is covered with crimson (dark red) velvet and decorated with gold lace and decorative metal.

The last sword is the Mansion House Justice Room Sword. The Lord Mayor is chief magistrate of the City, so the Swordbearer's room was made into a court in 1849. That's where this sword gets its name. Its blade is long and wide. It has an hilt and weighs without the scabbard. It is from around 1830 and it might be Portuguese.

Other cities have swords similar to the City of London's swords. Bristol, Lincoln and Exeter each have four. Thirteen other places in Britain have two swords each. So does Dublin.

The swords of the Lord Mayor of Bristol are:

Podolia

Podolia, also known as Podilia, is a region in Ukraine that's located south of Volhynia, north of both Moldova and Bukovina, and northwest of the Dniester River. It was a part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (where it had the highest population density) until the late 18th century, when it was split between Austria and Russia due to the partitions of Poland. Even afterwards, the Polish nobility continued to dominate Podolia while the peasants there were mostly Ukrainians. By the end of the 19th century, Ukrainian nationalism began spreading to Podolia. The towns of western Podolia failed to become large cities because they were overshadowed by Lviv. During the Russian Civil War, Poland, Ukraine, the White Russians, and the Bolsheviks all competed for Podolia. In the end, Podolia got divided between Poland, who got western Podolia, and the Soviet Union, who got eastern Podolia. This situation existed until World War II, when the Soviet Union conquered all of Podolia. Due to World War II, the Holocaust, and later emigration, the Jewish and Polish populations of Podolia significantly decreased. After the end of World War II, the Russian population in Podolia increased significantly. Even today, Podolia is one of the most agricultural and least industrialized parts of Ukraine.

He took part in several military campaigns, including those at Courtrai (1302) and Mons-en-Pévèle (1304), and two times was put in charge of proposed crusades that never actually occurred. He became the Grand Chamberlain of France in 1310 and became the Duke of Bourbon in 1327 thanks to Charles IV of France. He had two sons, Peter I, Duke of Bourbon, and Jacques I, Count of La Marche, from whom the later French Kings from the House of Bourbon (starting from Henry IV of France in 1589) descend in the male line.

McStroke

"McStroke" is the 8th episode of "Family Guy"s 6th season. It was first broadcast on the Fox network on January 13, 2008. It was written by Wellesley Wild. Brian Iles is the director of the episode. The episode is about Peter Griffin having a stroke after eating too many hamburgers.

Peter wants to get a mustache after reading a magazine about them. He gets one and thinks that he is a better person. He walks by a restaurant and sees it burning. A firefighter sees Peter's mustache and thinks he is also a firefighter. Peter goes in the restaurant and rescues the manager, but his mustache burns off. The manager gives him a big supply of burgers. Peter is sad that his mustache burned off, so he eats many burgers to feel better. He gets a stroke that paralyzes half of his body. He gets cured at a place for stem cell research. He ties to sue the restaurant, but he loses at a trial because he does not have any evidence. 

Peter and Brian go to the restaurant's headquarters. They take a tour of the place to try to find evidence. They find a slaughterhouse with a talking cow in it. The cow talks about how the restaurant has harmed many other cows. Peter and Brian help the cow leave the headquarters while security guards run after them. The cow makes a public speech that makes the restaurant look bad.

Stewie makes a bet to Brian that he will be the most popular kid in a high school. He gets a teenage girlfriend and wins the bet. He tries to have sexual intercourse with his girlfriend, but she laughs at him for having a small penis. On the next day, Stewie gets bullied for his small penis. He gets his girlfriend arrested by telling people she is a pedophile.

"McStroke" was written by Wellesley Wild and Brian Iles is the director of the episode.

Brad Trechak from TV Squad said that the episode had "really good ideas", but thought that the writing was not good.

Club" thought that the episode did not have much organization, but said there were some good jokes.

U.S. economic performance under Democratic and Republican presidents

Historically, the United States economy did better on average when Democrats were US President than when Republicans were US President. This was certainly true over the last several decades. The reasons for this are uncertain and debated. Ten of the 11 US recessions between 1953 and 2020 began under Republican US Presidents.

"Job creation" refers to the number of net jobs added, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports on a monthly basis. 
Journalist Glenn Kessler of "The Washington Post" summarized the total job creation by US President. For the 13 US Presidents starting from Harry Truman, total job creation was about 70.5 million for the 7 Democratic US Presidents and 29.1 million for the 6 Republican US Presidents. The Democratic US Presidents were in office for a total of 429 months, with 164,000 jobs per month added on average, while the Republican US Presidents were in office for 475 months, with a 61,000 jobs added per month average. This monthly average rate was 2.4 times faster under Democratic US Presidents.

Former President Bill Clinton said in 2012 that since 1961, Democratic US Presidents produced 42 million jobs in 24 years while Republicans produced 24 million jobs in 28 years.

Economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson said that, for the 1949-2012 time period, annual job growth was 2.6% for Democratic US Presidents and 1.2% for Republican US Presidents.

GDP is a measure of both economic production and income. "The Economist" reported in August 2014 that real (inflation-adjusted) GDP growth was about 1.8% greater under Democratic US Presidents, from Truman up to Obama's first term, which ended in January 2013. Blinder and Watson calculated the average Democratic real GDP growth rate as 4.3%, vs. 2.5% for Republicans, from President Truman's elected term up to President Obama's first term, which ended January 2013. "CNN" said in September 2020 that annual average GDP growth was 4.1% under Democratic US Presidents and 2.5% under Republican US Presidents.

The "New York Times" said in February 2021 that since 1933, annual average GDP growth was 4.6% under Democratic US Presidents and 2.4% under Republican US Presidents.

Blinder and Watson found that the US unemployment rate fell under Democratic Presidents by an average of 0.8%, while it increased under Republican Presidents by an average of 1.1%. Journalist Andrew Soergel wrote in "U.S. News & World Report" in October 2015 that ever since John F. Kennedy's Presidency, the unemployment rate was lower at the end of every Democrat's Presidency than at the start of it whereas this is only true for Ronald Reagan among Republican US Presidents during the same time period. (Soergel's statement here is slightly wrong since the US unemployment rate was exactly the same–at 7.5%–at both the start and the end of Democrat Jimmy Carter's Presidency.)

Blinder and Watson reported that budget deficits were smaller under Democratic US Presidents, at 2.1% potential GDP versus 2.8% potential GDP for Republican US Presidents, a difference of about 0.7%. They wrote that higher budget deficits should in theory have boosted the economy more for Republicans, and therefore cannot explain the greater GDP growth under Democrats.

Stock market returns are also higher under Democratic US Presidents ever since 1945, according to both CNN and Blinder and Watson.

CNN reported in October 2020 that 10 of the last 11 recessions began under Republican US Presidents, and that “Every Republican president since Benjamin Harrison, who was in office from 1889 to 1893, had a recession start in their first term in office.” NBER reports the start date of recessions; the following list includes the President in office at that time and their party:

Blinder and Watson calculated that the US economy was in recession for 49 quarters from 1949-2013; 8 of these quarters were under Democratic US Presidents and 41 of these quarters were under Republican US Presidents.

During a March 2004 interview, future Republican US President Donald Trump stated: "It just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans."

Journalist David Leonhardt wrote in the New York Times that economists he interviewed were unsure about the causes of the better economic performance under Democratic US Presidents. However, one proposed cause was that Democratic US Presidents were, on average, more pragmatic than Republican US Presidents were. Random good luck and the condition of the US economy at the start of US Presidents' terms have also been suggested as possible causes of this due to the fact that it's easier for an economy to grow rapidly and create a lot of jobs right after a recession as opposed to after a very long period of economic growth and strong job creation.

The table below compares various economic data for Democratic and Republican US Presidents, using the Blinder & Watson data (typically Truman's elected term through Obama's first term). 

James I, Count of La Marche

James I, Count of La Marche (1319 – 6 April 1362) was a French prince, the younger son of Louis I, Duke of Bourbon and the younger brother of Peter I, Duke of Bourbon. He was killed in 1362 at the Battle of Brignais, during the Hundred Years' War between the House of Plantagenet (which ruled over England and parts of France) and the House of Valois (which ruled over most of France). He was the father of John I, Count of La Marche, who married Catherine of Vendome and together had a son named Louis, Count of Vendome. James is also the male-line ancestor of Henry IV of France, the first French King from the House of Bourbon.

Pitch Lake

The Pitch Lake is the largest natural deposit of asphalt in the world. It is estimated to contain 10 million tons of asphalt. It can be found in La Brea in southwest Trinidad, inside the Siparia Regional Corporation. The lake covers about 100 acres (0,405 square kilometres). The lake is 250 feet (76,2 metres) deep.

The Pitch Lake has been very interesting to explorers and scientists. It was re-discovered by Sir Walter Raleigh in his expedition there in 1595. Raleigh himself used the asphalt to caulk his ship. The native Amerindians told Raleigh where he can find the lake. The native Amerindians had their own story about where the lake came from. The story goes that the people living there were celebrating a victory over a rival tribe when they got carried away in their celebration. They then cooked and ate the sacred hummingbird which they believed possessed the souls of their ancestors. According to legend, their winged God punished them by opening the earth and calling the pitch lake to swallow the entire village. So, the lake became a reminder of their sins. The local villages believe this legend because found many Amerindian artifacts and a skull that have been discovered and preserved, in the pitch.

In 1887, Amzi Barber, an American businessman known as "The Asphalt King", got a 42-year monopoly concession from the British Government for the Pitch Lake for his company, Barber Asphalt Paving Co. It was from the Pitch Lake that many of the first asphalt roads of New York City, Washington D.C., and other Eastern U.S. cities were paved.

Operational transformation

In computer science, operational transformation is a technique in building collaborative software systems.

Collaboration systems using operational transformations typically use replicated document storage where each user has their own copy of the document. Users operate on their own local copies. Their changes are then pushed to the rest of the users. When a user receives the changes pushed from another user, they typically transform the changes before executing them.

 The idea of operational transformation is to transform (or adjust) the variables of an editing operation according to the effects of previously executed operations so that the transformed operation can achieve the correct effect and maintain document consistency.

Operational transformation can be shown by using the example of a text editing scenario. Given a text document with a string "abc" replicated at two collaborating sites; and two concurrent operations:


generated by two users at sites one and two, suppose the two operations are executed in the order of O1 and O2 (at site one). After executing O1, the document becomes "xabc". To execute O2 after O1, O2 must be transformed against O1 to become: O2' = Delete[3, "c"], whose position variable is incremented by one due to the insertion of one character "x" by O1. Executing O2' on "xabc" deletes the correct character "c" and the document becomes "xab". However, if O2 is executed without transformation, it incorrectly deletes character "b" rather than "c".

Rulers of ancient Manipur before Nongta Lailen Pakhangpa

Black Adam (movie)

Black Adam is a 2022 American superhero movie based on the DC Comics character of the same name. It is produced by DC Films, New Line Cinema, Seven Bucks Productions, and FlynnPictureCo., and set for distribution by Warner Bros. Pictures. It is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra and written by Adam Sztykiel and Rory Haines & Sohrab Noshirvani.

The movie is a spin-off from "Shazam!" (2019) and the eleventh movie in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The movie stars Dwayne Johnson as Teth-Adam / Black Adam alongside Noah Centineo, Aldis Hodge, Sarah Shahi, Quintessa Swindell, and Pierce Brosnan.

"Black Adam" released in the United States on October 21, 2022.

In 2600 BC, the tyrannical king of Kahndaq, Ahk-Ton, creates the Crown of Sabbac, which gives the wearer great power. After attempting to stage a revolt, a young slave boy is given the powers of Shazam by the Council of Wizards, transforming him into Kahndaq's heroic champion, who kills Ahk-Ton and ends his reign.

In the present day, Kahndaq is oppressed by the Intergang. Archaeologist and resistance fighter Adrianna Tomaz tries to locate the Crown of Sabbac with the help of her brother Karim and their colleagues Samir and Ishmael. As Adrianna obtains the crown, Intergang ambushes them, and Samir is killed. Adrianna reads an incantation that awakens Teth-Adam, whom she believes to be Kahndaq's champion, from a slumber. Adam slaughters most of the Intergang troops. US government official Amanda Waller deems Adam a threat and contacts the Justice Society—Hawkman, Doctor Fate, Cyclone, and Atom Smasher—to take him into custody. The Justice Society arrives in time to stop Adam from causing further destruction to Kahndaq and Intergang's troops, before explaining to Adrianna that Adam was not a savior who was entombed, but a madman who was imprisoned.

Ishmael reveals himself as the leader of Intergang in Kahndaq and chases Adrianna's teenage son Amon, who has stolen the crown. Adam, Adrianna, and the Justice Society intend to use the crown to trade for Amon. They reach Ishmael, who reveals that he is the last descendant of King Ahk-Ton and, wanting his rightful place on the throne, demands the crown, which Adrianna willingly gives to save Amon's life. Ishmael betrays his part of the deal and shoots at Amon, and Adam, trying to save Amon, loses control and destroys the hideout with his power, killing Ishmael and wounding Amon. Guilt-ridden, Adam flees to the ruins of Ahk-Ton's palace, where he reveals to Hawkman that the legends of Kahndaq's champion were told incorrectly; it was Adam's son Hurut who was granted the powers of Shazam and became Kahndaq's champion. Knowing that Hurut was invincible, Ahk-Ton's assassins were instructed to execute Hurut's family, including Adam and Hurut's mother. Hurut gave Adam his powers to save his life, and Ahk-Ton's assassins immediately killed the de-powered Hurut. An enraged Adam slaughtered all of the king's men and inadvertently destroyed Kahndaq's palace. He was subsequently deemed unworthy by the Council of Wizards and imprisoned within the Rock of Eternity.

Feeling incapable of becoming a true hero, Adam surrenders. The Justice Society takes him to a secret Task Force X black site, where Fate has a premonition of Hawkman's impending death. As the Justice Society returns to the city, they realize Ishmael intentionally made Adam kill him while he was wearing the Crown of Sabbac, having shot at Amon so that he could be damned to Hell and reborn as the champion of the six demons of Sabbac, arising from the underworld to claim his throne and the power held within.

Sabbac summons the Legions of Hell to terrorize Kahndaq, but Amon, Adrianna, and Karim rally the people to repel them. The Justice Society prepares to face Sabbac in Ahk-Ton's ruins, but Fate creates a magical force field that prevents Hawkman, Cyclone, and Smasher from entering. He reveals that Hawkman's death can be avoided with his own sacrifice. Fate fights Sabbac alone and uses an astral projection to release Adam after talking to him in his cryo sleep. Sabbac then kills Fate, causing the force field to disappear, and allowing the others to fight. Just as Sabbac is about to kill the Justice Society, Adam arrives and engages him. With aid from Hawkman using Fate's helmet, Adam kills Sabbac. The Justice Society departs on good terms with Adam, who accepts his new role as the protector of Kahndaq and adopts a new name, Black Adam.

In a mid-credits scene, Waller communicates with Adam and warns him against leaving Kahndaq, before Superman arrives and suggests that they should talk.

The illegal drug trade based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia is booming. A team headed by Deputy Commissioner of Police De Silva targets the operations of cartel leader Singhania to capture his manager, Mark Donald (aka Don). Singhania is one of the two lieutenants of a deceased kingpin, known as Boris; the other is Vardhaan.

Don kills Ramesh, one of his close associates, after he tries to leave the gang. Ramesh's fiancée Kamini decides to help the police. She uses herself as bait in an attempt to trap him, but Don, knowing of her plan, kills her.

Roma, Ramesh's sister, plans to avenge her brother and sister-in-law's deaths, and infiltrates Don's gang. Don is injured and falls into a coma while trying to flee from the police. De Silva finds a look-alike named Vijay and asks him to join his mission. Vijay agrees when De Silva promises to admit Deepu, a boy Vijay takes care of, to school. Meanwhile, Jasjit, an information technologist and Deepu's father, is released from prison. He plans to kill De Silva to avenge his own wife's death. Several years ago, Jasjit was captured by an unknown assailant who made a deal with him in order to save his kidnapped wife. However, De Silva caught him and refused to believe Jasjit, shooting him in the leg and giving him a permanent limp. Jasjit's wife died shortly after his arrest.

At the hospital, a doctor gives Vijay scars identical to Don's. When Don suddenly dies after the operation, the masquerade begins. Vijay, posing as Don, joins the gang. De Silva asks Vijay to find a computer disc containing details about the drug cartel. When Vijay finds it, Roma attempts to kill him, but De Silva tells her of Don's real identity, and she agrees to help. Vijay hands over the disc to De Silva. De Silva murders Singhania, and the police arrest Vijay. De Silva is killed in the shootout, devastating Vijay, as De Silva was the only person who could prove that he is not the real Don. Having discovered his true identity, Don's associates turn against him. Vijay escapes and meets with Roma to recover the disc and prove his innocence.

Jasjit finds the disc in De Silva's apartment. He receives a call and is told that he will have to bring the disc to the men who are holding Deepu hostage. He learns that De Silva has been alive all along and is actually Vardhaan, Boris's other lieutenant, who was using Vijay to reach Singhania. Jasjit reunites with Deepu and teams up with Vijay and Roma. The trio comes up with a plan and informs Interpol.

In combat, Vijay overpowers Vardhan but is interrupted by Inspector Vishal Malik, who has Vardhaan arrested. Vijay is acquitted, and Roma confesses her love for him. Too late, she realises, in a twist ending, that she was being toyed with: Don is alive and was pretending to be Vijay all along. At the hospital, Don had overheard Vardhaan and Vijay's plan. After Vijay's operation, Don switched places with him and injected an overdose of diazepam in Vijay's glucose stream, causing him to die and making the doctors think it was Don who died. The disc Don gave to the police was fake. Now, with both Vardhaan and Singhania removed, Don becomes the master of the Asian drug cartel.

Don 2

Don 2 (also known as Don: The King Is Back) is a 2011 Indian Hindi-language action thriller film written, co-produced and directed by Farhan Akhtar. It is the second installment in the "Don series". Jointly produced by Excel Entertainment and Red Chillies Entertainment, the film stars Shah Rukh Khan, Priyanka Chopra, Lara Dutta, Om Puri, Boman Irani and Kunal Kapoor. This film is a sequel to the 2006 film "Don". The film's music was composed by Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy, while Javed Akhtar wrote the lyrics. Jason West served as the film's cinematographer and Ritesh Soni was its editor.

"Don 2" was released on 23 December 2011. The film had a mixed to positive reception from critics, receiving praise for the cast's performance, cinematography, production design, and action sequences. However, its pace and music received criticism. With a box office gross of over , "Don 2" was a big box office success. At the time of its release, the film was one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time and is the highest-grossing Indian film of 2011. The film received a number of accolades across various ceremonies in India. The film received five nominations at the 57th Filmfare Awards, including Best Film, Best Director for Akhtar and Best Actor for Khan, winning Best Sound Design and Best Action.

Five years after the events of "Don", the European drug cartel bosses meet in the French Riviera on a yacht to discuss a new threat emerging from Asia: Don is jeopardizing their business by undercutting their prices and they decree that he must die. Living in Thailand for the last five years, Don goes to a remote settlement to pick up a shipment of cocaine. He gets cornered by his own allies who reveal to him that once he is killed, the cocaine from Asia will be open for sale in Europe and they will usurp all the profits. Don makes his way out by killing all his allies and destroying the entire settlement. Later, Don returns to Malaysia, surrendering to Roma, who has joined Interpol, and Inspector Malik. He is sentenced to death and sent to prison, where he meets old rival Vardhaan.

Initially, Vardhaan tries to exact revenge on Don for having him imprisoned five years back, he patches up with Don when the latter offers him an opportunity to escape with him. Don and Vardhaan eventually break out by poisoning the other inmates. In Zurich, Don meets trusted companion Ayesha, and they retrieve a tape from a secret locker whose key was under Vardhaan's possession. It shows J.K. Diwan, vice-president of the Euro-printing DZB ("Deutsche Zentral Bank") bribing Singhania to kill James Werden, the original choice for the President of the DZB so that Diwan's superior, Fabian Kohl would become the new president. Singhania was killed by Vardhaan five years earlier. Don blackmails Diwan into giving him the bank's blueprints so he can steal the printing plates. Diwan gives him fake blueprints and hires Abdul Jabbar, a deadly assassin. 

However, Don escapes, and with no other choice, Diwan gives him the original blueprints. Roma and Malik arrive in Berlin and unsuccessfully interrogate Diwan, after having found evidence of him being involved with Don in some illegal activity, while Don and his team execute a bank robbery. After stealing the printing plates, Don is betrayed by Vardhaan and Jabbar but escapes. Another team member, Sameer, calls the police on Don and he is arrested. Don blackmails Diwan into giving him German immunity in exchange for erasing the evidence of him being involved in the murder of James Warden. He then negotiates with the German police and Interpol over surrendering the plates and a disc containing details of the European underworld in exchange for the safety of the hostages and defusing the bombs in the bank. 

Don and Roma reach Vardhan after bloody combat with his thugs and find themselves in a standoff. Though ordered by Vardhaan and Jabbar - and even Don himself - Roma is unable to kill Don and is shot by Jabbar in response; she still has feelings for him, even though he killed her brother and his fiancée five years earlier, and also does not want to do it illegally. Don manages to subdue Vardhaan and kills Jabbar. He obtains his immunity papers and surrenders the plates and the disc, as per the bargain. Don brings Roma to an ambulance and they exchange glances before the doors close. When the police later investigates the evidence, they are shocked to discover Diwan and Kohl were behind Werden's murder. Don later detonates a bomb planted earlier in Diwan's car, killing Diwan and seemingly destroying the plates which he had taken. 

In a final scene, it is revealed Don still has the currency plates, the ones which the police believe was destroyed in the explosion were fake. Sameer was actually loyal to Don; informing the police was part of the plan. The disc Don turned over actually contains the names of the European drug cartel. Having been exposed, Kohl is shortly arrested too, and the DZB is forced to replace him. After they are arrested, Don becomes king of the European underworld and tells Ayesha and Sameer they have no idea how rich they will become.

About a sequel, Shah Rukh Khan said: "It would be great to revisit "Don" after some time. I’ve told Farhan that we could take 60 days out of our schedule and make a "Don 3". But we need a script first, one that could take the last 10 minutes of "Don 2" forward to another differently exciting thriller." Farhan Akhtar also expressed a desire to take the story forward and said he was fascinated by the character of Don. However, the filmmaker wanted to explore other genres without restriction and added that he was currently focusing on his acting career.

In August 2014, it was reported that Farhan Akhtar planned to play a role in the film. In October 2015, Akhtar said that "Don 3" will go on floors by late 2016. However, the film is at the scripting stage. It has also been reported that Katrina Kaif will replace Priyanka Chopra in the next installment. But the makers denied this, stating that the only constant in the third installment will be dependent on Don, the rest of the characters, and the script.

Released worldwide on 5 June 2015, the film features an ensemble cast of Anil Kapoor, Shefali Shah, Priyanka Chopra, Ranveer Singh, Anushka Sharma and Farhan Akhtar, along with a voice-over performance by Aamir Khan as the family dog Pluto and the narrator of the film.

The film tells the story of the Mehras, a dysfunctional family who invite their family and friends on a cruise trip to celebrate the parents' 30th wedding anniversary and later reconcile.

Zoya conceived the film as a family drama centered on a brother-sister relationship. She wanted to depict a more realistic sibling relationship in contrast to the dubious and over-the-top portrayal for which Bollywood is known. She later wrote the script with her friend and longtime collaborator Reema Kagti, while Farhan penned the dialogues. Much of the principal photography was done on Pullmantur Cruises' ship MS Sovereign while sailing across the Mediterranean Sea and Europe, and on land in France, Spain, Tunisia, Turkey and Italy. 

The soundtrack was composed by the trio Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy, with lyrics by Javed Akhtar. The film was released worldwide on 5 June 2015 to positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances of Kapoor, Shah, Chopra and Singh, who portrayed the members of the Mehra family, as well as Akhtar's direction, cinematography and costumes.

It received five Filmfare nominations, winning Best Supporting Actor for Kapoor. "Dil Dhadakne Do" also received nine nominations at the 2016 Screen Awards, including Best Film, and won two, Best Supporting Actor for Kapoor and Best Ensemble Cast.

The film is narrated by Aamir Khan in a voice-over for a dog named Pluto belonging to the Mehras, a dysfunctional family that comprises Kamal Mehra (Anil Kapoor), a billionaire businessman in Delhi who owns AyKa, a company on the verge of bankruptcy, and has a troubled relationship with his wife Neelam (Shefali Shah), older daughter Ayesha (Priyanka Chopra) and younger son Kabir (Ranveer Singh). Ayesha has a successful travel business in Mumbai, but is unhappy with her marriage to the narcissistic and controlling Manav Sangha (Rahul Bose), who hates her family along with his mother Smita (Zarina Wahab). Kabir unwillingly takes part in the AyKa business, instead of fulfilling his dream of becoming an aircraft pilot. Kamal and Neelam invite their family and friends for a cruise across the Mediterranean Sea to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary.

Their guests include the Sood family. Kamal and Neelam plan Kabir's wedding to the Soods' daughter Noorie (Ridhima Sood), in exchange to her father Lalit (Parmeet Sethi) investing in AyKa, aiming to prevent bankruptcy. However, Noorie falls for Rana (Vikrant Massey), the son of the Soods' sworn rival Khannas. Aboard, Kabir falls in love with Farah Ali (Anushka Sharma), a dancer and ship performer from Birmingham. On the other hand, Ayesha, while strongly disapproving Kamal and Neelam's plans to betroth Kabir to Noorie, blurts out before then and Kabir that she miserably wishes to divorce Manav due to their bitter married life. 

During this emotional crisis of Ayesha, enters aboard Kamal's manager Amrish's (Ikhlaque Khan) Egypt-based son Sunny Gill (Farhan Akhtar), a childhood friend of Ayesha and Kabir who had only gifted Pluto to the Mehra family. Sunny and Ayesha are revealed to be teenage lovers, but Kamal had paid for and arranged Sunny's Yale University scholarship to separate him from Ayesha. Ayesha and Sunny, now a successful journalist, still harbour feelings for each other. Unlike Manav, Sunny appreciates Ayesha's strong personality and is a feminist.

Meanwhile, Neelam sees Kamal flirting with a local guest and wonders why she did not divorce him despite his past infidelities. Ayesha confronts Sunny about their separation and kisses him, which shocks them both. Farah hears that Kabir is going to marry Noorie and storms off. Kamal sees Noorie making out with Rana and learns that Kabir and Noorie are not together as he had thought, causing him to have a minor gas attack. After the confirmation of Kamal's recovery, Kabir reveals to the family that he is in love with Farah and that he intends to leave the AyKa business and asks them to consider Ayesha, who is actually interested in the business. When he tries to persuade them to let her proceed with her divorce, Kamal and Neelam refuse, believing marriages are lifelong commitments. 

Infuriated, Kabir bursts out that they are hypocrites for talking of marriage, values, and morals, as the whole family circle is aware of Kamal's adultery and that Neelam has been suffering silently for years. Kamal asks Neelam why she did not leave him and she reveals that she had no choice because her family would not accept her back due to dishonour. Kamal realises his mistake and profusely asks for Neelam's forgiveness. While trying to reconcile Manav and Ayesha, Kamal sees how his son-in-law mistreats his daughter and orders him and Smita to leave, finally agreeing to the divorce and apologizing to his daughter.

Meanwhile, Farah is dismissed from her job for being romantically involved with a passenger and told to leave the ship. Kabir learns about her dismissal after the ship has set sail. He breaks news of Ayesha's now-impending divorce to Sunny, and after publicly rejecting his impending marriage to Noorie, jumps off the ship to swim to shore, believing his family will rescue him. Kamal, Neelam, Ayesha and Pluto scramble aboard a lifeboat and go after Kabir with the help of their friends. While leaving, Ayesha asks Sunny if he will wait for her, to which he replies "forever". The family successfully rescues Kabir and heads toward shore to help him find Farah while being chased by the ship's crew. The Mehra family is seen happy in each other's presence for the first time as Pluto narrates that togetherness is what matters the most in any circumstances around the world.

Killing of Andrew Brown Jr.

On April 21, 2021, Andrew Brown Jr., a 42-year-old African American man, was shot dead in the back of the head by a deputy sheriff in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. Seven officers were placed on leave as a result of the shooting. Brown died one day after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of the death of George Floyd, and his death happened near the time of other notable police killings including the deaths of Daunte Wright, Ma'Khia Bryant, and Adam Toledo in the United States.

Brown had two outstanding warrants in Dare County "on drug-related charges including possession with intent to sell cocaine."

Pasquotank County Sheriff Tommy Wooten II said that "deputies from his department including a tactical team were attempting to perform search and arrest warrants on illegal distribution of cocaine, methamphetamine, crack cocaine and heroin when Brown was shot." Brown's death certificate states that Brown died from being shot in the head.

Seven sheriff's deputies were placed on administrative leave as a result of the shooting. Within a week of the killing, two other deputies resigned and one other deputy retired; this was not related to the killing, stated a member of the Pasquotank County Sheriff's Office.

Elizabeth City declared a state of emergency in preparation of the release of the body cam footage to the public. Pasquotank County Attorney Michael Cox said faces in the video were being blurred. On the sixth day of marches in the city, protesters shut down the bridge over the Pasquotank River between Elizabeth City and Camden County. An hour later, the bridge was reopened to traffic. Elizabeth City mayor, Bettie Parker, declared a state of emergency before the full release of the body cam footage that led up to the shooting.

On April 26, Brown's family and their lawyers were allowed by Pasquotank County to watch a short bodycam video of the shooting. Family lawyer Chantel Cherry-Lassiter said that the video of 20 seconds showed the deputies shooting at Brown when he sat in his vehicle with his hands on the steering wheel. Cherry-Lassiter said Brown then drove away, while the deputies continued shooting at him, with Brown ultimately crashing the vehicle into a nearby tree. Cherry-Lassiter also said the deputies continued shooting after the crash.

The FBI announced on April 27 that it would be launching a civil rights probe into Brown's death. An agency spokesman stated, "Agents will work closely with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina and the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice to determine whether federal laws were violated."

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki stated "Obviously, the loss of life is a tragedy and obviously we're thinking of the family members and the community" and that President Biden was aware of the situation. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, as well as the family of Brown, immediately called for the bodycam footage to be released. People protested an emergency meeting of the Elizabeth City council with signs reading "Black Lives Matter" and "Stop killing unarmed Black Men."

On Twitter, North Carolina governor Roy Cooper wrote, "Initial reports of the shooting in Elizabeth City and death of Andrew Brown, Jr. this week are tragic and extremely concerning. The body camera footage should be made public as quickly as possible and the SBI should investigate thoroughly to ensure accountability."

Kalinga (historical region)

Kalinga was a kingdom in what is now the country of India. It included a large part of Odisha, northern Andhra Pradesh and a small part of Chhattisgarh. It was an independent kingdom.

Kalinga fought against the Maurya Empire in 261 BC. The Maurya Empire was led by Ashoka. The effects of the war were described by Ashoka in Major Rock Edict 13. About 150,000 people were killed during this war.

Kalinga was an important port for trade because it was easy to reach Southeast Asia from there. Kalinga again became an independent state after the death of Ashoka. In Sangam literature, it is mentioned that Kharvela of Kalinga tried to invade north India against Pushyamitra, the founder of the Sunga Dynasty, but there is no clear evidence of that. The Sunga Dynasty was founded just after the Mauryan.

Self-governance of Singapore

The self-governance of Singapore happened in several stages. Since 1819 up to 1959, Singapore had been under the colonial rule of the United Kingdom. The first local elections on a limited scale for several positions in the government of Singapore started in 1948 following a change to the Constitution of Singapore.

This was further changed with the Rendel Constitution, strengthening local representation. Singapore was granted full internal self-government in 1959, but the colonial administration still controlled external relations and shared control of several key internal policies such as internal security.

In 1963, Singapore joined Malaysia, ending colonial rule and becoming an autonomous state within the country. After a fallout in the relations between the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and the People's Action Party (PAP), the ruling parties of the Federation and Singapore at the time, full independence came about with Malaysia forcing Singapore to leave in 1965.

Battle of the Japan Sea (movie)

Nihonkai daikaisen ( Battle of the Japan Sea) is a 1969 Japanese war drama film directed by Seiji Maruyama and produced by Tomoyuki Tanaka. Set between 1904 and 1905, Japan and Russia clash in what comes to be known as the Russo-Japanese War. An attempt by the Japanese fleet and army to take Port Arthur fails, and a Russian fleet bears down on the Sea of Japan.

Veteran screenwriter Toshio Yasumi wrote the script and Seiji Maruyama (who had filmed Rengo kantai shirei chôkan: Yamamoto Isoroku in 1968) directed the film. Special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya of "Destroy All Monsters" worked on the set and Hiroshi Murai of "Nikudan" was in charge of filming the scenes.

The concurrent screening work is "Konto 55-Gō jinrui no dai jakuten", directed by Jun Fukuda.

It is said to be the third work in the "Toho 8/15 series", but unlike the two previous war films, this one take place during the Russo-Japanese War. From the beginning of the war, to General Nogi Maresuke's troops attack Port Arthur, and the combined fleet led by Admiral Togo Heihachiro at the Battle of Tsushima to defeats the Baltic Fleet led by Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky.

This work was the last film in which Eiji Tsuburaya participated it as special effects director. The ship miniature mobilized 60 art designers and 107 ships were prepared for the movie.

In addition, the miniature of the battleship Mikasa was made up to 13 meters.

In the naval battle scene, considering that the power of the bullets is weaker at the time of the Russo-Japanese War than during the Pacific War, the water column is expressed by freon gas.

During the late 19th century, the Qing dynasty continued to disintegrate in turmoil due to corruption, peasant unrest, ruler incompetence, and population growth which led to food shortages and regular famine. In 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion, the Eight Nation Alliance (Britain, United States, Germany, France, Russia, Japan, Italy and Austria-Hungary) joined forces together to occupied many ports and cities in China. However, only Russia kept its troops in Manchuria and set up their railway line which caused tensions with Japan over the sphere of influence.

At the Imperial Conferences meeting with Emperor Meiji, they sent an ultimatum to recognize Russian dominance in Manchuria in exchange for recognition of Korea being within the Japanese sphere of influence. Finally, diplomatic relations between two countries began to get worse. Togo Heihachiro, Admiral of the Fleet in the Imperial Japanese Navy, was eyeing Lushunkou (Port Arthur) and the movement of the Russian Pacific Fleet in Vladivostok, and devised a secret plan. He got reports that Captain Takeo Hirose, commanding the old cargo vessel "Fukui Maru" and several ships, was spotted by the Russian fleet squadron and was hit, destroying the ship and killing Hirose. Many officers and sailors managed to escape from the Battle of Port Arthur. War was declared after the first naval battle. The Japanese Navy won its first battle against the Russians.

In the meantime, Japanese troops deployed from Korea to Manchuria. The First Army under General Kuroki Tamemoto landed on Incheon to occupied Seoul and began marching north to meet the Russian army at the Yalu River. After defeating them, the Third Army led by General Nogi Maresuke march on to Port Arthur and began the siege. The Russian Navy was unable to relieve the siege after they were defeated again by the Japanese squadron at Chemulpo Bay. On October 20, the Baltic Fleet left the port of Rabaul.

Togo decided that the enemy ships would appear in the Sea of ​​Japan and dragged the combined fleet inland. On New Year's Day, five months after the attack began, General Nogi planned an attack on 203 Hill, trying to capture the fortress. However, the commander of Port Arthur Anatoly Stessel managed to hold off the attack by setting up machine guns, artillery positions, land mines, and searchlights. The Japanese continued to attack the fortress until the defense commander Roman Kondratenko was killed by artillery shells and Stessel had no choice but to surrender the fortress to General Nogi.

Around this time, Akashi Motojiro, an intelligence officer in Stockholm (Sweden), learned that the route of the Baltic Fleet would be determined by Russian Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky. They discovered the Baltic Fleet headed off to the Goto Islands. Seven days later, Admiral Togo, who hoisted the Z flag on board the flagship Mikasa, took an intrepid tactic that took a big turn in front of the Russians. A fierce battle at Tsushima brought a great victory to the Japanese fleet. People of Japan who are excited about victory and the Russians are forced to surrender in the Treaty of Portsmouth on September 5, 1905. This resulted in Russia a bloody revolution by mass demonstrations over the defeat. However, Togo could not forget the true "fear of battle" by winning the war.



The DVD version of the film was released by Toho Video on Jan 25, 2005

Artifact (error)

In natural science and signal processing, an artifact or artefact is any error in the perception or the way any information is represented or introduced by the equipment or technique(s).
In computer science, digital artifacts are abnormalities introduced into digital signals because of digital signal processing.
In microscopy, visual artifacts are sometimes introduced when processing samples into slide form.
In medical imaging, artifacts are wrong representations of structure of tissues. They are made by imaging techniques such as ultrasound, X-ray, CT scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These artifacts may be caused because of the energy-tissue interaction between ultrasound and air. Physicians usually learn to recognize some of these artifacts to avoid mistaking them for actual pathology.
Radar echoes from something causes ghost images to appear. All those echoes must be filtered in order to get the where the object is, how fast it is going and the type of object it is. It may include aircraft, and weather.

Francis, Duke of Châtellerault

François de Bourbon (or Francis of Bourbon), Duke of Châtellerault (1492 – 13 September 1515) was a French prince from the House of Bourbon-Montpensier, a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon (itself a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty). He was the brother of Louis II, Count of Montpensier, Charles III, Duke of Bourbon (also known as "The Constable of Bourbon"), Louise de Bourbon, Duchess of Montpensier, and Renée of Bourbon (who became Duchess of Lorraine on 26 June 1515, less than three months before François's death).

François de Bourbon was the third and youngest son of Gilbert de Bourbon, the Count of Montpensier, and his noble Italian wife Clara Gonzaga, with both of François's parents dying before he even became a teenager. François fought loyally under the command of his elder brother Charles in Guyenne and Navarre and was rewarded for his services by Francis I of France with the Duchy of Châtellerault in February 1514. François de Bourbon was killed in action on 13 September 1515 at the Battle of Marignano (in what is now the northern Italian city of Melegnano, in Lombardy) against the Swiss during the Italian Wars. After François's death, the Duchy of Châtellerault passed onto François's elder brother Charles, who was already Duke of Bourbon. After Charles's death in 1527 during the Sack of Rome, French King Francis I's mother Louise of Savoy inherited the Duchy of Châtellerault, with it becoming a part of the French royal domain after Louise's death in 1531. Later on, the Duchy of Châtellerault was given to Charles II de Valois, Duke of Orléans, the third and youngest son of Francis I of France.

François de Bourbon never married but was rumored to have had an illegitimate daughter named Isabelle de Bourbon (who allegedly married a Spaniard named Laurent Suarez, the Count of Corunna), but this was never actually proven.

Cadet branch

A cadet branch is the part of a family that is descended from a younger son (or daughter). Cadet branches are important for royal succession since if the main royal branch runs out of people (or out of males, if females are not allowed to inherit the throne), then a cadet branch would inherit the throne. However, sometimes there were also cases where a cadet branch acquired a throne before the main royal branch actually ran out of males, such as when Louis-Philippe of France became French King after Charles X of France abdicated due to the Revolution of 1830 even though Charles X still had a surviving son and grandson of his own during this time.

Twait shad

The twait shad or twaite shad ("Alosa fallax") is a fish. It was much eaten, and thought to be one of the best-tasting fish. 

Its life style is rather similar to the salmon. The adults live in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, but come up rivers to breed. They have vanished from the dinner table because the Victorians build weirs in the Severn which stopped the fish getting to their breeding grounds The Severn, in SW England, is vital to the fish. It is by far the largest river opening in that part of the Atlantic. Overfishing, pollution and habitat destruction have also helped the shad's decline.

Now, ways round the weirs are being built, so the fish can once again reach its ancestral breeding grounds.

Compression artifact

A compression artifact (or artefact) is a deliberate visible change in media (including images, audio, and video). It is caused by lossy compression. Lossy data compression removes some of the media's data. This way the data becomes small enough to be stored in the desired disk or transmitted inside the available bandwidth. If the compressor cannot store enough data in the compressed form, the result is a loss of quality, or introduction of artifacts.

The most common digital compression artifacts are DCT blocks. This is caused by the discrete cosine transform (DCT) compression algorithm used in many digital media, such as JPEG image compression, MP3 digital audio, and MPEG video coding formats. 

These compression artifacts appear when heavy compression is applied. It occurs often in common digital media, such as DVDs, common computer file formats such as JPEG, MP3 and MPEG files. It also occurs in some other alternatives to the compact disc like the as Sony's MiniDisc format. Uncompressed media (such as on Laserdiscs and WAV files) or losslessly compressed media (such as FLAC or PNG) do not suffer from compression artifacts.

Übermensch

Übermensch is a concept from philosophy. The concept is used to describe a human that has outgrown himself or herself, that is no longer burdened by the sorrows of ordinary people. Today, the concept is mainly known from the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche who, in his 1883 book "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" (German: "Also sprach Zarathustra"), Nietzsche has his character Zarathustra suggest the Übermensch as a goal for humanity to set for itself. Nietzsche thought that the moral values of the Catholic Church were outdated. For him, an "Übermensch" is one that is able to develop moral values which are not based on religion, but rather, rooted in Nihilism. When Nietsche used the term, he took most of the ideas from the French philosopher Claude Adrien Helvétius. Helvetius used the term "homme supérieur."

The idea itself is much older: Dionysius of Halicarnassus talked about a "hyperanthropos" (hyper: above, "anthropos": human) in the first century BC. He lived c. 60 – after 7 BC) and was a Greek historian and teacher of rhetoric.

Lucian used the term, to talk about noblemen, who would be "cut back to their real size" in the realm of the dead. In his Divine Comedy, Dante used the hapax legomenon "transhumana"r to refer to the Übermensch. Transhumanar is a verb. The writings of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite influenced Dante Pseudo-Dyonysius is an early Christian writer from Syria, who lived in the 6th century. He is not known by name, but used the pen name Dionysius Areopagita. Dionysius Areopagita lived in the 1st century, and was one of the bishops of Athens.

Untermensch

Untermensch (plural: Untermenschen) is a term many racist ideologiers use. It can be translated as sub-human or under-human. Nietzsche, and others developed the term Übermensch, to refer to someone who has outgrown himself, and who no longer has all the problems ordinary people have For the Nazis, the Übermensch was someone of Aryan descent. The Untermensch, on the other hand was used for all the people of the races seen as inferior, such as the Jews, the Slavic people, gypsies or black people. 

When the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union, Heinrich Himmler published a booklet, called "Der Untermensch". This brochure was distributed in Germany: it was made to increase the hatred towards the people of the Soviet Union (note: not the Slavic people, the term Slavic people never occurs in the brochure). The booklet was very popular, also with the German allies, such as the people in Croatia, Slovakia or Bulgaria. These people received copies in their own language. The booklet didn't provide much information about the Soviet union, it was mainly used to race hatred. Some people in the Nazi government were against the publication of the booklet: they thought they could convince the common people of the Soviet Union to fight against the Bolsheviks in power. During 1942, the publication of the booklet was stopped.

In 1924, Fritz Lang published his movie "Die Nibelungen", where he shows that the smith Mime (also called Mimir) as an Untermensch. During the Wochenschau, the Nazis showed several movies with Russian people in simple wooden houses, travelling on badly maintained roads. This was done to show the German people how inferior the people of the Soviet Union were. Needless to say: these clips also were propaganda. 

Movies that were made after the second world war, also show the concept of Untermensch: Louis de Funès has a few of these movies: In his movies, the term is not used for people of other nations seen as inferior, but rather: for people of the own nations, who have character traits that are seen as bad.

During the Second World War, Japan expanded to China and in Southeast Asia. During that time, prisoners of war and civilians were used for experiments on humans. Unit 731 became known for experiments with chemiclal agents and pathogens, such as those causingthe plague, or smallpox. They also did experiments with poison gas. In Japanese, the people were called "maruta," which can be translated as wood, or material. This a similar value judgement than that of Untermensch.

1995–1996 United States federal government shutdowns

The United States federal government shutdowns of 1995 and 1995–96 was caused by problems between Democratic President Bill Clinton and the Republican Congress over funding for education, the environment, and public health in the 1996 federal budget. The shutdowns lasted from November 14 through November 19, 1995, and from December 16, 1995, to January 6, 1996, for 5 and 21 days.

The first shutdown happened after Clinton vetoed the spending bill the Republican-controlled Congress sent him, as Clinton did not support the budget cuts favored by Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and other Republicans. The first budget shutdown ended after Congress passed a temporary budget bill, but the government shut down again after Republicans and Democrats were unable to agree on a long-term budget bill. The second shutdown ended with congressional Republicans accepting Clinton's budget proposal. The first of the two shutdowns caused the furlough of about 800,000 workers, while the second caused about 284,000 workers to be furloughed.

Polling generally showed that most respondents blamed congressional Republicans for the shutdowns, and Clinton's handling of the shutdowns helped his successful campaign in the 1996 presidential election. The second of the two shutdowns was the longest government shutdown in U.S. history until the 2018–2019 government shutdown passed it in January 2019.

Petro ran again for president in the 2022 election. His campaign focused on climate change and reducing Greenhouse gas emissions that cause it by ending fossil fuel exploration in Colombia. In May 2022, he came in first place in the first round of voting and advanced to the June run-off against right-wing populist Rodolfo Hernández Suárez. In June 2022, he won the election by a 50% to 47% margin and became the country's first left-wing president in Colombia's history.

Petro was born in Ciénaga de Oro, Córdoba. His parents were farmers. He was raised Roman Catholic, although he is not very religious.

Petro studied at the Colegio de Hermanos de La Salle. He founded the student newspaper "Carta al Pueblo" ("Letter to the People"). At the age of 17 he became a member of the 19th of April Movement. During his time in 19 April Petro became a leader, and was elected ombudsman of Zipaquirá in 1981 and councilman from 1984 to 1986.

Petro and his running mate Francia Márquez got many death threats from paramilitary groups while on the campaign trail. He had cancelled rallies in Colombiaʼs coffee region in early May 2022 after his security team found a plot by the La Cordillera gang. Many international politics signed a letter in support of Petro and criticized the rise of political violence in Colombia. Some of the people who signed were former Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa, American linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky and member of the French National Assembly Jean-Luc Mélenchon. During the campaign, Petro was supported by former Uruguayan president José Mujica and former Spanish prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero.

Petro won the most votes in the first round held on 29 May but did not win more than 50% of the vote to avoid a second round. He faced the former mayor of Bucaramanga and businessman, Rodolfo Hernández Suárez in the run-off on 19 June.

Petro was sworn in on 7 August 2022.

Pedro Castillo

José Pedro Castillo Terrones (born 19 October 1969) is a Peruvian former schoolteacher, farmer, union leader and politician who was the 63rd President of Peru from 2021 to 2022. Castillo attempted to illegally dissolve Congress through a self-coup on 7 December 2022 while citing Congress' efforts to block his attempted policies, resulting in the legislative body impeaching and removing him from office the same day.

Castillo was born to two illiterate peasants in the town of Puña, Tacabamba, Chota Province, Department of Cajamarca. Cajamarca, despite being the location of South America's largest gold mine, has remained one of the poorest regions in Peru. He is the third child of nine in his parent's family.

During the internal conflict that began in the 1980s, Castillo worked in his youth as a patrolman of the Ronda Campesina to defend against Shining Path. A former student of Castillo, Nilver Herrera, followed him into the Ronda Campesina, saying that Castillo "was always trying to help people, ... If we had to build a road, he was there, if we had to do some task or errand, he was there, and if we had to help a sick person who didn’t have money, he was there." These groups held certain leftist beliefs, though they combatted left-wing terrorism in rural areas not under the scope of the Peruvian government.

He completed his elementary and high school education at the Octavio Matta Contreras de Cutervo Higher Pedagogical Institute and earned a bachelor's degree in education and a master's degree in Educational Psychology from the César Vallejo University.

Since 1995, Castillo has worked as a primary school teacher at School 10465 in the town of Puña, Chota, where he was responsible for cooking, cleaning and teaching for the students in his classroom.

He became a well known leading figure in the 2017 teacher strike in Peru. He ran for President of Peru in the 2021 general election with Free Peru and defeated Keiko Fujimori in the run-off election in June.

Since taking office, Castillo has distanced himself from Free Peru and became more moderate. He faced two impeachment proceedings in the Peruvian Congress, although both failed to reach the necessary votes to remove him from office. With the country's raising inflation and disapproval of his presidency, massive protests against Castillo began in March 2022.

His administration has not been able to find a solution to the political crisis and the economic issues the country had. Castillo ultimately left the Free Peru party in June 2022 to govern as an independent. In July 2022, a fifth investigation was launched into Castillo's possible corruption involvements. 

Peru's Congress approved on 1 December a motion to start impeachment proceedings against Castillo. On 7 December it was reported that Castillo had declared a national curfew and attempted to dissolve Congress in order to stop the impeachment process. Shortly after his declaration, most of his cabinet resigned and he was impeached.

Ruffle (software)

Ruffle is an open source program that runs Flash content. It is written in Rust. The emulator can be ran on Windows, macOS, Linux or major web browsers.

Adobe Flash was very popular to use for many types of media, such as videos, games and interactive applications, in the 2000s and early 2010s.

HTML5, a version of HTML which does these things better, slowly made Flash less popular. From 2015, Adobe has openly said HTML5 is better because it is a full open standard. Flash continued to become less popular. In 2017, Adobe said they plan to retire Flash by 2020.

It is often not recommended to create Flash content now, but being able to run old SWF files has been a major digital preservation worry.

Google Labs closed Swiffy, which could convert Flash content to HTML5, in 2016.

In 2016, Mike Welsh started the project, which was named Fluster.

"Ruffle" is open source. Its source code is available on GitHub.

Some websites have said they will use "Ruffle" instead of Flash as early as 2019. For example:

"Ruffle" can run older Flash content, which uses ActionScript 1.0 or ActionScript 2.0. ActionScript 3.0 support will come.

Point shaving

In sports, point shaving, is a certain type of match fixing where basketball or other sports players try to prevent a team from covering a published point spread. Spread betting usually motivates point shaving. The point shaving scheme usually involves a sports gambler and several players who are likely to win the game. In exchange for a bribe, the players agree to making sure the team they are on will not cover the point spread. The gamblers then wager against the bribed team.

Basketball is a very easy medium for shaving points. This is because of the scoring tempo of the game and the ease under which one player can influence key events. Corrupt players miss shots on purpose or commit fouls or turnovers. By doing so, he/she makes sure that his or her team fails to cover the actual point spread. However, the game is not lost. The NCAA have a zero tolerance policy prohibiting point shaving.

Asphalt concrete

Asphalt concrete is a composite material. It is commonly used to build roads, parking lots, airports, and embankment dams. Asphalt mixtures have been used in making pavements since the beginning of the twentieth century. It is made up of mineral aggregate bound together with asphalt. The process was made by Edward De Smedt.

Mixing of asphalt and aggregate is done in one of several ways:

This is made by heating the asphalt binder to make it less viscous, and drying the aggregate to remove moisture from it before mixing it. Mixing is done at about 300 °F (roughly 150 °C) for virgin asphalt and 330 °F (166 °C) for polymer modified asphalt, and the asphalt cement at 200 °F (95 °C). HMA is used on roads with lots of traffic.

This is made by adding either zeolites, waxes, asphalt emulsions, or sometimes even water to the asphalt binder before mixing. It is good for the environment because small amounts of fossil fuels are used to make them. It also releases less carbon dioxide into the air. In 2012, a survey of producers that made asphalt in the US found that nearly 25% of asphalt made was warm mix.

This is made by emulsifying the asphalt in water. It is done with an emulsifying agent before mixing. While it is emulsified, the asphalt is less viscous. The emulsion will break after enough water evaporates from it. Cold mix is commonly used on roads with less traffic.

List of rulers of Moirang

The genealogical order of the rulers of Ancient Moirang till the modern day Moirang, were recorded in many manuscripts including the Moirang Ningthourol Lambuba and other historical documents associated with the Moirang Kangleirol.

Due to the lack of exact historical datings, the first recorded seven rulers, just before the rulers with dated reigns, were considered to be mythological rather than being historical.
The recorded historical dates of the reigns of the rulers started from 52 BC when Emperor Phang Phang ascended the throne of Ancient Moirang kingdom.

Bycatch

When doing industrial fishing, people want to catch certain species of fish. When they are using nets, they will also catch other species. These are called bycatch or by-catch. Most of the time, the animals caught will be severely injured or killed. Most of these species are thrown back into ithe sea, but some of the bycatch is used. The exact amount of bycatch is not known. There are estimates that up to a quarter of the total may be bycatch. When catching shrimp, up to eighty percent may be bycatch. Another problem is that the amount of bycatch is not recorded, and does not show up in statistics.

Mostly people under the age of 25 became sick. About 700,000 people died. This pandemic was caused by H1N1 influenza virus, which is very similar to the virus strain that spread worldwide from 1946 to 1957.

Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim

Ayatollah Sayed Mohammed Baqir (or Bakr) al-Hakim (1939 - August 29, 2003) was the foremost Shia Muslim leader in Iraq until his assassination in a terrorist bombing that killed him and 80 others as they were leaving a mosque in Najaf. He was the son of Ayatollah Muhsin Al-Hakim, the worldwide leader of Shia Muslims from 1955 to 1970.

Al-Hakim co-founded the modern Islamist political movement in Iraq in the 1960s, along with Ayatollah Sayed Mohammed Baqir Al-Sadr, with whom he worked closely until the latter's death in 1980. Though not among the most hard-line of Islamists, Al-Hakim was seen as dangerous by the ruling Baath regime, largely because of his agitation on behalf of Iraq's majority Shia population (the ruling regime was comprised mostly of Sunnis). This led to his arrest in 1972, but he was released shortly thereafter.

He was partially blamed for the uprising in Najaf that occured in February 1977, and so was arrested again, and this time sentenced to life imprisonment. However, his sentence was commuted and he was released in July 1979. The subsequent eruption of war between Iraq and (largely Shia) Iran led to an ever-increasing distrust of Iraq's Shia population by the rulling Baath party; combined with his previous arrests, this convinced Al-Hakim that it was impossible to continue his Shia advocacy in Iraq, and in 1980 he fled to Iran.

Safely in Iran, Al-Hakim became an open enemy of the Baathists, forming the Supreme Council of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq (SCIRI), a revolutionary group dedicated to overthrowing Saddam Hussein's regime. In 1983, Hussein responded by arresting 125 members of Al-Hakim's family who had remained in Iraq, and executing 18 of them. This further embittered Al-Hakim's view of the Baathists in general and Hussein in particular. With Iranian aid, SCIRI became an armed resistance group, periodically making cross-border attacks on Iraqi facilities, maintaining covert connections with resistance elements within the country, and generally being a perennial thorn in Hussein's side.

Al-Hakim returned to Iraq in May 2003 following the overthrow of Hussein's regime by the US-led invasion of Iraq. There he emerged as one of the most influential Iraqi leaders, with his longtime opposition to Hussein gaining him immense credibility, especially among the majority Shia population.

Initially he was very critical of the US-led occupation of Iraq, saying "we do not put confidence in the Americans, they have always acted against the interests of the Iraqi people" and urging Iraqis not to follow the US's administration's dictates. However, he did give the US credit for overthrowing the hated Baathist regime, and through the summer of 2003 indicated some willingness to work with the Americans in setting up a civilian government in Iraq. By the time of his death, he remained distrustful, but urged Iraqis to abandon violence, at least for the time being, and give the interim government a chance to earn their trust.

It is unclear (as of late August 2003) who was behind the massive bomb attack that killed him. A spokesman for SCIRI in London suggested that supporters of Saddam Hussein may have been behind the attack; others suggest it may have been orchestrated by Sunnis not necessarily connected to Hussein who are opposed to the increasing Shia influence in the country; a few suggest it may have been carried out by hard-line Shia groups critical of Al-Hakim's increasingly conciliatory line towards the United States. However, as his assassination comes in the midst of a pattern of violence against Shia clerics in Najaf in recent weeks (Al-Hakim is the fourth to be assassinated), it is considered likely that the attack was motivated by anti-Shia sentiment rather than by a conflict between Shia moderates and hardliners.

John Whiteaker

John Whiteaker (May 4, 1820-October 2, 1902) was an American politician, a Democrat, and served as the first state Governor of Oregon from 1859 until 1862. 

Born in Dearborn County, Indiana to farmers, Whiteaker only spent six months of formal schooling, and as a result, was almost entirely self-educated. Before moving west, he had performed odd jobs, carpentry, and volunteered for military service during the Mexican War, although his unit was never called into battle. In 1849, he joined the California Gold Rush, earning enough to move his family to a farm in Lane County, Oregon. Once in Oregon he became active in Democratic Party activities, Elected to office first as Judge of the Probate Court for Lane County (1856), then as a legislator in the Territorial Legislature (1857).

Oregon was preparing for statehood in 1857, as voters had just approved a state constitution. Whiteaker was selected as a Democratic faction's nominee in the first state gubernatorial election, held in June 1858. Whiteaker won by a margin of 1,138, and was innagurated July 8, 1858. He did not assume office until word that Congress had passed Oregon's statehood bill on February 14, 1859. Technicaly, Oregon had two governors in the interrum, as Territorial Governor George Law Curry, was legally in charge until the state government-in-waiting was legally empowererd to take control. 

Once in office, the new governor set out to untangle the large amounts of land claims and counter claims on public lands. He also promoted economic policies favoring home industries, products that Oregonians could make self-sufficiently. Although nicknamed "Honest John", this did not deflect his controversial stands on issues of national importance. Whiteaker held pro-slavery views which did not sit well with apopulation mostly in the abolitionist camp. Opponents often used this to attack him as a traitor as the United States descended into the Civil War.

Whiteaker was not nominated again by the Democrats in the 1862 election, and thus left office. He did stay in local politics, winning three terms as a state representative (1866-1870), and election to the State Senate in 1870.

Whiteaker was elected to Congress in 1878, as Oregon's Representative-at large. The Democrats had been weakened in the House, and needed one vote to prevail in their nominee for Speaker of the House. The vote was needed by March 18, 1879. Whiteaker, all ready on his way to Washington, received word of this urgency while on a steamer between Portland and San Fransisco, California. Upon docking in San Francisco on March 12th, he was met by a railroad agent, and rushed to a special Central Pacific Railroad express train at Oakland. The regular transcontinental train was 25 hours out of Oakland, but Whiteaker's train managed to catch up with it. He arrived in Washington on the morning of March 18th, in enough time to be promptly seated by Congress and cast his vote.

The trip cost $1500 at the time, an expense widely criticized by the Democrat's political oppostition and the media. Many referred to it as "Whiteaker's ride".

Whiteaker served in Congress until 1881, retiring to his farm near Eugene.

John Whiteaker would be called back into politics one more time, in 1885 when President Grover Cleveland appointed him as Oregon's Collector of Revenues at the U.S. Customs House in Portland. After 1890, moved back to Eugene, purchasing 10 city blocks in the central city. The area today is now known in Eugene as Whiteaker's Addition. He stayed in Eugene until his death in 1902.

In 1850 A.C. Gibbs moved to the Oregon Territory. There he moved to the town of Gardiner on the Umpqua River where he would become a member of the Territorial Legislature in 1852. He was also appointed as a customs collector for Gardiner, located at the mouth of the Umpqua.

Then in 1860 Gibbs relocated to Portland, Oregon, where he was elected to the state house. Next, in 1862 he was elected as governor of Oregon, serving as the governor during the American Civil War. During the war in 1864, responding to orders from Congress, Gibbs raised an infantry regiment despite opposition from Oegonians.

George Lemuel Woods

George Lemuel Woods (1832–1890), was a Republican Oregon State Governor (1866–1870), and was then appointed Utah Territory Governor (1871–1875) by President Ulysses S. Grant.

La Fayette Grover

La Fayette Grover (b. November 29, 1823 – d. May 10, 1911) was a Democratic representative and senator from Oregon, USA.

Grover was born in Bethel, Maine. He was educated at Bethel's Gould’s Academy and Brunswick's Bowdoin College. Studying law and passing the bar in Philadelphia in 1850, he moved to Oregon in 1851 and set up practice in Salem.

The Oregon Territorial legislature elected him prosecuting attorney for Oregon second judicial district and auditor of public accounts for the Oregon Territory. From 1853 to 1855 he was elected to the territorial house of representatives. In 1854 he was appointed by the Department of the Interior to audit the claims out of the Rogue River Indian War. He then was appointed by the Secretary of War in 1856 to a board of commissioners to audit the Indian war expenses of Oregon and Washington.

In 1857 he was a delegate to the Oregon constitution convention and upon admission of Oregon as a state was elected as a Democratic representative to the Thirty-fifth United States Congress serving from February 15, 1859, to March 3, 1859. He did not run for reelection in 1858, instead resuming his law practice and the manufacture of woolens.

He was elected Governor of Oregon in 1871 and served until 1877 when he resigned, having been elected to the United States Senate. Grover served from March 4, 1877, to March 3, 1883 serving in the Forty-sixth United States Congress as the chairman of the Senate Committee on Manufactures. Not a candidate for reelection in 1883, instead he resumed the practice of law and retired from public life. Grover died in Portland, Oregon, on May 10, 1911 and was interned in Riverview Cemetery. 


Stephen F. Chadwick

Stephen Fowler Chadwick (December 25, 1825 - January 15, 1895), was an American Democrat politician who served as Governor of Oregon from 1877 to 1878. Governor Chadwick was the first person to obtain the governorship by way of the state's Line of Succession.

Chadwick was a lawyer, admitted to the New York State Bar on May 30, 1850. He soon made his way to Oregon, setting up a law firm in the Douglas County settlement of Scottsburg in April 1851. Chadwick served as the town's first postmaster.

After moving from Scottsburg to Roseburg, Chadwick ran for the newly created position of Judge of Douglas County. Later he would go on to represent Douglas County at the Oregon 1857 State Constitiutional Convention. In the 1864 and 1868 Presidential elections, Chadwick served as an Democratic elector.

Chadwick won the 1870 election to the position of Secretary of State, and was subsequently reelected in 1874.

In 1877, La Fayette Grover resigned the governorship after his election to the United States Senate by the State Legislature. Chadwick, as Secretary of State and second in the gubernatorial line of succession, was inaugurated to fill out the remaining year of Governor Grover's term.

Although unconstitutional under Article V, Section 1 of the State Constitution, Chadwick also kept his position of Secretary of State. When signing official documents requiring the signatures of both the Secretary of State and Governor, he would sign first on the left side, then on the right.

The most notable policy of his administration was Chadwick's stand on the Nez Perce Wars raging in the northeastern part of the state. Chadwick was unhappy with the stalemated situation, going so far as to inspect the front lines first-hand. He aided white settlers during the conflict, and argued for much harsher punishments for rebellious and uncooperative tribal leaders than the Army's policies.

At the time of the 1878 elections, Governor Chadwick declined a second term and went back to practicing law. He died on February 15, 1895 in Salem, Oregon.



W. W. Thayer

William Wallace Thayer (July 15, 1827 - October 15, 1899) was a Democratic politician active in U.S. states of Idaho and Oregon. Most notably, he was the sixth Governor of Oregon from 1878 to 1882 and Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court from 1888 to 1889. 

Thayer was born on a farm near Lima, New York on July 15, 1827. He received a public education before studying law in college. He was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1851. He then practiced law with his brother in Buffalo and later Tonawanda.

A mining boom in Idaho Territory caught Thayer's attention in 1860, prompting him to move west. He arrived in Corvallis, Oregon in 1861, where he joined another brother, Andrew, at his law firm. In 1863, he would finally move to Idaho, setting up his own law firm in Lewiston. 
In 1866, three years after moving to Lewiston, Thayer was elected District Attorney for the Third Judicial District of Idaho Territory. From 1866 until 1867, he moved to Boise to serve for a session of the Idaho Territory House of Representatives. He moved to Portland, Oregon shortly after leaving the legislature.

Upon returning to Oregon, Thayer establuished a sucessful law firm in the city of East Portland. At this time, he became an active member of the Democratic Party. During the 1876 Hayes-Tilden Presidential Election dispute, Thayer was a member of the legal team which challened the certification of J. W. Watts, a Republican elector for Rutherford B. Hayes. Although sucessful, this challenge did not help Samuel Tilden prevail in the Electoral College.

Still appreciative of his assistance in the Watts Case, the Oregon State Democratic Party nominmated Thayer for Governor in 1878. Thayer would win narrowly, by a margin of 59 votes.

Thayer's time in office is remembered as a fiscally conservative, anti-corruption administration, which sought to make the state bureaucracy more efficient. The State Board of Equalization, land law reforms, and the establishment of a State Mental Hospital were initiated under his leadership. He would completely eliminate the state's debt while in office.

Governor Thayer was often spoke out about the state's finances. Highly critized by Thayer was how the State Legislature based its budget appropriations. He called for revenue projections to be based on actual revenues, not what was anticipated as the Legislature had often done in the past. He also refused to fund the completion of the State Capitol Building, stating that the building was too expensive and lavish for Oregon.

His lasting legacy was reforming the Supreme Court of Oregon into its present incarnation by statute. Previously, Circuit Court judges served also as Justices of the Supreme Court. After the statue change, Supreme Court positions were made a seperate, directly-elected office.

Thayer declined to run for a second term in the 1882 gubernatorial election. Instead, he successfully ran a campaing for Justice of the Supreme Court in 1884. Justice Thayer remained on the bench until 1889, the last two years of that term serving as Chief Justice.

Thayer died in Portland on October 15, 1899.

Sylvester Pennoyer

Sylvester Pennoyer (July 6, 1831 - May 31, 1902) was a populist Democrat and served as governor of Oregon (1886 - 1894) and as mayor of Portland, Oregon (1896 - 1898).

Pennoyer was born in Groton, New York, and studied law at Harvard. After graduating, he moved to Oregon where he practiced law and ran local businesses. He was the petitioner in the Supreme Court case "Pennoyer v. Neff" which defined legal jursidictino over citizens in different cases.

As typical for that time, he acted in a stridently partisan manner while governor. He pointedly snuubed president Benjamin Harrison when Cleveland visited Oregon in 1891. He refused to use his resources to protect Chinese-Americans when asked by Grover Cleveland's Secretary of State on May 3, 1893. He again refused to intervene at the request of Cleveland when a group of unemployed workers, part of "Coxey's Army", hijacked a train to travel east and join a mass march on Washington, DC.

William Paine Lord

William Paine Lord (July 1, 1838 - February 17, 1911), was a Republican politician. He was Governor of Oregon from 1895 to 1899. 

Lord was born to Edward and Elizabeth (Paine) Lord in Dover, Delaware. He was partially deaf, and had limited speaking ability. He received his primary education at a Quaker school and through private tutoring. He subsequently studied law at Fairfield College, graduating in 1860. Before he could continue further into his studies, Lord volunteered for military service in the United States Civil War, advancing to the rank of Major in the Union Army. 

Once the war ended, Lord continued in law school at Albany College, graduating there in 1866. He then returned to the military for a second time, re-enlisting at the rank of lieutenent. His duties would include postings at Alcatraz in San Francisco and Fort Steilacoom near Tacoma, Washington. When the United States took formal posession of Alaska in 1867, Lt. Lord was sent to Sitka. In 1868, Lord resigned from the army in order to set up a law practice in Salem, Oregon.

William Pain Lord soon became involved in politics, as he became Salem's City Attorney in 1870. This launched him into his first elected office as a state Senator in 1878. He would resign this seat for a sucessful run as the Republican nomine for Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court. Lord served on the court from 1880 until 1894. He was a popular jusice and had a reputation of being the most competent Jurist in state history, serving out his last term as Chief Justice.

He accepted the Republican nomination for the 1894 Governor's Election, stepping down from the court after his gubernatorial election victory.

Governor Lord's popularity swept him into the Governor's Office. He immediately set out to support higher education, eliminate corruption from land speculators, and fueled support for the direct election of Untied States Senators, when the Senate refused to seat Henry W. Corbett, Lord's apointee.

He promoted ending the corrupt land speculation practices of the time by creating the State Land Board, headed by an official State Land Agent. The present land-use system protecting Oregon's wildlife and fisheries would evolve from this early agency.

Lord also called for a constitutional amendment to the Oregon Constitution allowing the Governor a line item veto. While nothing came of this while he was in office, later governors would would support Lord's proposal. The line item veto was finally approved in 1916.

Lord lost his bid for a second term, after losing in the closely fought 1899 primary election campaign against fellow Republican Theodore Thomas Geer.
Shortly after leaving the Governor's Office, Lord was appointed the U.S. Minister (Ambassador) to Argentina by the Mc Kinley Administration. He served in that capacity until 1902, returning back to Oregon. 

During his time in Oregon, between 1902 and 1910, Willaim Paine Lord was appointed as Code Comissioner by the Supreme Court of Oregon. He proceeded to examine and annote all existing Oregon Statute Laws, compiling them into the three volumed "Lord's Oregon Laws", officially the Oregon Statute Code of 1909.

In 1910 Lord retired to San Francisco, where he would die on February 17, 1911.

He served as district attorney for the third judicial district, Attorney–General of the State, and district attorney for the fourth judicial district. In 1902 he was elected Democratic Governor of Oregon, and in 1906 he was re–elected. He was twice elected to the United States Senate where he served for twelve years (1909–1921). He was author of the Chamberlain Military Preparedness Bill of 1918. He became a member of the United States Shipping Board for the term 1921–25.

Frank W. Benson (Oregon Governor)

Frank W. Benson (March 20, 1858 – April 14, 1911) was an American politician, a Republican, and the 12th Governor of Oregon from 1909 to 1910.

Benson was born in San Jose, California in 1858 to a minister sent west by the Methodist Epispocal Church in 1882. His father, Henry Clarke Benson, moved the family to Portland, Oregon to become editor of the "Pacific Christian Accord" in 1864.

Young Frank was enrolled in the Portland Academy, later continuing his education at the College of the Pacific in Stockton, California. After college, he returned to Oregon, begining a career in education. In 1880, he took charge of the Methodist Umpqua Academy in Wilbur, Oregon. Benson assumed his first elected office as Superintendent of Douglas County Schools between 1882 and 1886. He relinquished the post after becoming president of a Normal School in Drain.

Benson would return to politics in 1892, after his election as Douglas County Clerk. He was relected and passed the state bar exam in 1896. In 1898, Benson began practicing law in Roseburg.

In 1906, Benson would run for Secretary of State, winning both the Republican primary and the general election. The sitting governor George Earle Chamberlain won election to the United States Senate in 1909 and resigned the governor's seat. As Secretary of State, Frank Benson was next in the gubernatorial line of sucession, and was sworn into office March 1, 1909. 

Following Governor Stephen F. Chadwick's example, who assumed the governorship in 1877 under similar circumstances, Benson kept both the Governor's and Secretary of State's offices. Although this is normally forbidden under the Oregon State Constitution. He collected pay for both offices.

Governor Benson undertook no major changes in the state government despite holding two of the states most powerful offices. Instead, he called for a special session of the Legislative Assembly to pass a bill which had been overlooked in the last (25th Biennial) Session. This bill funded operation costs for the state's major institutions, namely the state's prison, reform school, mental hospital, school for the blind, and veteran's home. He also attempted to settle a boundary dispute with neighboring Washington.

Benson had been gravely ill even before he accepted the governorship. Although his condition had seemed to improve since taking office, he left for California in 1910 to seek further treatment. On June 15, 1910, Benson telephoned his priovate secretary, transfering the Governor's powers to Oregon State Senate President Jay Bowerman until he could return to Salem. Bowerman was sworn in as Acting Governor on June 16, 1910. Benso had indicated that he hoped to return by July 20, 1910. He did not seek reelection as Governor; but won reelection as Secretary of State in 1910. Although retaining one of his positions, Benson did not return as planned. His health continued to fail in Redlands, California, where he died April 14, 1911.



Jay Bowerman

Jay Bowerman (August 15, 1876 – October 25, 1957) was an American politician, a Republican, who served most notably as the 13th Governor of Oregon.

Bowerman was born in Hesper, Iowa, the son of Daniel and Lydia (Battey) Bowerman. His siblings were named Ralph, Martha and Mary.

He received his early education in public schools of Hesper, then moved to Salem, Oregon in 1893. He entered Willamette University that same year and graduated with a law degree in 1896 at the age of twenty. He was admitted to the Oregon Bar the following year, practicing law in Salem until 1899. He then moved to Condon, in Gilliam County, Oregon, where he lived for the next twelve years. There he became a law partner of H. H. Henricks. Bowerman's service in the Spanish-American War briefly interrupted his practice of the law. 

He married Elizabeth Hoover in 1903 and together they had three children: William, Daniel and Elizabeth. However, the couple divorced and Bowerman married Wayfe Hockett in 1914; this marriage produced two further children, Sally and Jayne. 

He was elected to the Oregon State Senate from Gilliam County in 1904 and was reelected four years later. He served as president of that body from 1909 to 1911. When Governor Frank W. Benson was incapacitated by ill health in June 1910, he asked Bowerman. as President of the Senate, to assume gubernatorial responsibilities. On June 16, 1910, at age thirty-three, Bowerman became Acting Governor. 

Mindful of bureaucratic economy, Bowerman advocated establishment of a Board of Control to administer the state institutions, which would permit fiscal savings by combined purchasing for state institutions through the office of a single purchasing agent. However, the Board of Control was not established until the administration of his successor. He acted to reduce the risk of loss through bank failure by prohibiting Oregon bankers from the use of speculative stock as assets if they had actively promoted that stock. In 1904 the citizens of Oregon adopted a direct primary law prohibiting party nominating conventions. But establishment Republicans, unwilling to relinquish party control over nominations, held an "assembly" in 1910 at which they nominated Bowerman as their candidate for governor. He was therefore cast in the role of opponent of the "Oregon System" of direct government by his Democratic gubernatorial rival, Oswald West. Bowerman campaigned on a platform supporting modernized highway systems, increased economies in the administration of government, and continued tight control of state land management. West defeated him, however, 54,853 votes to 48,751.

After leaving the office of governor on January 8, 1911, Bowerman moved to Portland, where he resumed the practice of law. He was reelected President of the State Senate but retired following the 1911 session. As a private citizen he actively supported Oregon's first statewide bond issue for highway construction, a $6,000,000 proposal. He also served as an active lobbyist for years at the State Legislature. He died in Portland in 1957.

Oswald West

Oswald West (May 20, 1873- August 22, 1960) was an American politician, a Democrat, who served most notably as the 14th Governor of the state Oregon.

West was born in Ontario, Canada but moved to Salem, Oregon with his family at the age of four where he attended school and eventually went into banking. After several years as a banker in Salem and Astoria, Oregon and a six month stint searching for gold in Alaska West gained an appointment to the State Land Commission. He proved effective in his position with the State Land Commission recovering almost 1 million acres of fraudulently held state land. After leaving the Land Commission he earned a term the Oregon Railroad Commission where he again found a great deal of success.

In 1910 he gained the Democratic nomination for Governor and went on to defeat his opponent and take the office. While in office West defended what he called the "Oregon System" which included initiative and referendum systems still in use in many western American states today. These systems led to women's suffrage, prohibition and various workers rights laws being put in to action under his lead. All pet issues of Governor West.

West's most notable work was in protecting the state's natural resources. It was under his administration the beaches bordering the Pacific Ocean were protected for public use; the office of State Forester and the Bureau of Forestry were established; and the Fish Commission and Game Commission were created.

West served only one term, opting not to run for re-election in the 1914 election. He instead moved his family to Portland, Oregon where he practiced law. He died in Portland on August 22 1960.

Oswald West State Park on the Oregon coast was named in his honor.

James Withycombe

James Withycombe (March 21, 1843-March 3, 1919) was a British-born American politician, a Republican, and the 15th Governor of Oregon.

Born to Thomas and Mary Ann Withycombe in Devonshire, England, English tenant farmers in 1843. Withycome emigrated to the United States with his parents in 1871, settling on a farm near Hilsboro, Oregon. After turning 17, he spent four years working on his father's farm. In 1873, Withycomb purchased his own 100 acre parcel on the Horace Lindsay Land Claim, later expanding his holdings to 256 acres. Agriculture became Withycomb's passion, becoming a prosperous livestock breeder and establishing a reputation as a successful scientific farmer.

His success led to his involvement in local farming organizations. He became a charter member of the Farmington Grange, and later became a leader in the state grange movement. From these platforms, Withycomb's efficient, innovative, and profitable farming methods became a model for farmers across the Pacific Northwest. His stature gained him an appointment as State Veterinarian in 1889, where he would diligently work to improve conditions of livestock health around the state.

Although mostly self-educated, he was sought after by the Oregon Agricultural College at Corvallis (now Oregon State University) in 1898 to head up the college's experimental farming station. He received his Master's Degree in Agriculture 1891 from OAC. Using this position to advance Oregon agriculture, he would play a major part in introducing alfalfa and clover to Eastern Oregon, laying the groundwork for the region's future agricultural economy.

Withycomb also became heavily involved in Oregon's agricultural industry, serving as president of the North Pacific Wool Growers and Northwest Sheep Breeders Associations. His tenureship on the board of the Oregon Academy of Sciences saw the dairy industry's profits rise from $2.5 million to $20 million. Such accomplishments built up respect for Withycombe statewide and gained the state Republican Party's attention.

Withycomb would enter politics in the 1906 primary, losing the Republican gubernatorial nomination. The 1910 election of controversial Democratic Governor Oswald West energized Oregon Republicans, who tapped Withycombe for the 1914 gubernatorial race. He handily defeated challenger Charles Smith; the first Republican Governor to assume office via election since T. T. Geer in 1903.

As Governor, James Withycombe vigourously promoted agricultural development. A notable proposal from his administration was to ask the Legislative Assembly to subsidize flax production as a prison industry. 

The Withycombe Administration backed the "Good Roads" movement, creating the Oregon Highway Commission while in office. With the new commission in place, a large road-building program was initiated, establishing many of Oregon's modern state routes and highways. 

Upon the U.S. entry into the First World War, Governor Withycomb took a vocal and patriotic postion in support of the war effort. He encouraged volunteer military service, and promoted the state's war industries.

While in office, he took a strong position against labor unions. He spoke out publicly against the Industrial Workers of the World, claiming that it terrorized labor and would cripple industry following several instances of I.W.W. threats to disrupt production in 1917. He organized veterans of the Spanish-American War into an Oregon State Defense force, and encouraged citizens in Eastern Oregon to form self-defence committees to defend the state against violent labor agitators. Withycomb used his powers as Governor to shipyard prevent a strike in Astoria, by calling out the National Guard.

His 1918 reelection campaign capitalized on his wartime acts, portraying him as a wartime Governor actively protecting the state and aiding the defense of the United States. These efforts gained him a second term, of which he only served two months. James Withycombe died in office of a heart condition on March 3, 1919, succeeded by President of the Oregon State Senate Ben W. Olcott.



Ben W. Olcott

Ben W. Olcott (October 15, 1872 – March 3, 1952) was a Republican Governor of Oregon, USA.

Olcott was born in Keithsburg, Illinois. He was educated at a Keithsburg elementary school and a business school in Dixon, later becoming a clerk in Chicago. In 1891, at age 19, he moved to Salem, Oregon, and became a roommate and good friend of Oswald West. West would become a major influence in the development of Olcott's political career. 

For nearly 15 years, Olcott travelled throughout the Pacific Northwest, mostly in order to prospect for gold. Often this interrupted pursuits of other occupations, mostly in the field of banking. His trips would take him to Southern Oregon (1892-93 accompanied by Oswald West), back to Salem to become a bank teller (1893-1895), Northern Washington and British Columbia (1895-1897), and then back to Illinois for a career as a bank cashier.

Olcott's sense of adventure prevailed again in 1904, leading him to Alaska. His journey ended notably when he drove a dog sled team to Nome, a trip of over 1,000 miles up the Yukon and Tanna Rivers in the height of winter. Settling in Fairbanks, Olcott found work as a gold dust teller, and later a bank branch manager. He managed to make a sizeable profit from gold prospecting, allowing him to move back to Oregon.

Olcott's good friend Oswald West had entered politics, heading the State Land Office. West offered Olcott a position in the Land Office, which he accepted in 1909. He became more interested in the political process, and was appointed by Governor Chamberlain to oversee the state's interest in a failed Portland bank, which held a large amount of state school funds.

Although he was a Republican, and West was a Democrat, the two had a strong friendship which transcended politics. Olcott ran West's victorious 1910 gubernatorial campaign, and contributed $1,500 to his friend's effort. He married Lena Olcott (nee Hutton), Oswald West's sister-in law.

In 1911, during Oswald West's Governorship, Secretary of State and former Governor Frank W. Benson, died of illness. Despite being from an opposing party, West appointed Olcott as Secretary of State to fill out the rest of Benson's term. Olcott would be elected in his own right to the office in 1912, and reelected in 1916.

On March 3, 1919, Governor James Withycombe died after serving only two months of his second term in office due to heart complications. Ben Olcott, as Secretary of State, assumed the Governorship under the state's gubernatorial line of sucession. Withycombe was so widely respected that Olcott refused to be sworn in until after the late Governor's funeral.

Once in office, Governor Olcott continued Withycombe's road-building agenda. Today's policy of leaving a protected buffer of forested land around state highways was instituted under the Olcott Administration.

Olcott Built upon Withycombe's defense and state safety policies. His administration managed to obtain U.S. Army air patrols for spotting forest fires. He proposed legislation banning the Japanese from holding land in Oregon.

The growing power of the Ku Klux Klan in Oregon alarmed Governor Olcott, who did not hesitate to denounce the organization. He refused any Klan support for his 1922 gubernatorial campaign, jepordizing his nomination. Olcott narrowly won the Republican nomination, but lost the general election to the Klan-supported, Democratic Senate President Walter M. Pierce.

After his electoral defeat, Olcott left Oregon to manage the Long Beach, California branch of the Bank of Italy. In 1924 he returned to Oregon to become a director of the Oregon Mutual Savings Bank in Portland. He died in Portland on July 21, 1952, and was buried in Salem. 



Walter M. Pierce

Walter Marcus Pierce (May 30, 1861 - March 27, 1954) was an American politician, a Democrat, who served most notably as the 17th Governor of Oregon and a member of the United States House of Representatives from Oregon's 2nd Congressional District.

Pierce was born to Charles M. and Charlotte L. (née Clapp) Pierce, Jacksonian Democrat farmers in Morris, Illinois on May 30, 1861. At the age of 17, he began teaching school despite only having a secondary education.

The ideas of Manifest Destiny as espoused by Horace Greeley, influenced Pierce to move west in 1883. After arriving in Portland, Oregon in June of that year, he found no available work. After a time working the wheat fields of eastern Washington Territory, he earned enough money to finally settle in Milton, Oregon in Umatilla County. There, he returned to a career in education, and established a successful farm.

As an educator, Pierce was drawn into local politics. He became well known for his pro-temperance views, as he regularly spoke out against saloons selling alcohol to his students. In 1887, he married one of his students, Clara R. Rudio, who would die during childbirth only three years later. He would marry Clara's sister, Laura in 1893.

From 1886 until 1890, Pierce served as Superintendent of Umatilla County Public Schools. From 1890 until 1894, he served as Umatilla County Clerk, a prosperous time in which he earned enough money from land transactions to further his education. He then returned to Illinois with his family to attend Northwestern University, earning his Bachelors of Law degree in 1896.

After graduation, the Pierce family returned to Oregon, where Walter set up a successful law firm in Pendleton. Between 1896 and 1906, he would manage a power company, speculate in land, and become one of the state's most renowned Hereford Cattle breeders. He won election to and resumed the office of County Clerk, between 1899 and 1903.

Pierce would successfully run for a seat in the Oregon State Senate in 1902. In his first term in the Senate, he unsuccessfully attempted to win passage of prohibition legislation, while successfully winning passage of a state subsidy of $6 per child for education. He was defeated at the polls for reelection, and retired from politics for a decade beginning in 1906.

While out of politics, Pierce continued local and statewide activities. He took part in founding the Oregon Farmer's Union and the Public Power League, headed the State Taxpayers League, and took a seat on the board of Regents of Oregon Agricultural College from 1905 to 1927. He began advocating for using the Columbia River for hydroelectric electric power during this time.

Pierce attempted a run for the Democratic nomination for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1912, losing to Harry Lane in the general election. In 1916, his constituents elected him to once again serve in the State Senate. Pierce then unsuccessfully ran against incumbent Governor James Withycombe in 1918 as a progressive Democrat. In the next election, 1920, he lost his senate seat by only twenty-seven votes.

The loss of his State Senate seat did not stop Pierce from further pursuing the Governor's office. In 1922, he ran a successful campaign against Ben W. Olcott, with aid from the Ku Klux Klan.

At the time, the Klan was growing in influence and power across the state, and had crafted an overtly anti-catholic and anti-sematic Cumpulsory School Bill. Governor Olcott was perceived as Catholic, and defiantly refused to work with the Klan in any way. Pierce had no such qualms, but was instructed by his advisors to not acknowledge any ties to the Klan. He lent his support to the school bil, and was swept into office with the largest margin of victory recorded in an Oregon Governor's race.

As governor, Pierce had to battle with a Republican-dominated legislature. His administration was able to continue the road-building policies of the previous two administrations, but could not win passage of a state income tax or assessed value license fees for automobiles. He attempted to gain support from progressive Republicans on issues of prison reform, reforestation, and hydroelectric development, but divided the state Democratic Party by endorsing Robert M. La Follette for president in 1924. In March 1925, his second wife, Laura, succumbed to cancer.

In the 1926 elections, Republican I. L. Patterson defeated Pierce. Upon leaving the Governor's office, Pierce returned to his ranch in Eastern Oregon to reflect upon his future political prospects.

Pierce decided that he wasn't through with politics, and unsuccessfully ran for the 2nd Congressional District seat in 1928. This same year, he married Cornelia Marvin, the first State Librarian of Oregon, his third and final wife. He declined to run for a second, inconsecutive term as governor in 1930.

Pierce tried once more for Congress in 1932, a good year for progressive Democrats. He was elected amid exitement over the landslide Presidential election victory of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Pierce would become a staunch supporter of FDR's New Deal, serving in Congress until his electoral defeat in 1943.

One of the oldest politicians in Oregon history, Pierce retired from politics at age 81. He died near Salem, Oregon on March 17, 1954.



I. L. Patterson

Isaac Lee "Ike" Patterson, (September 17, 1859 - December 21, 1929) was a Republican Governor of Oregon from 1927 to 1929. 

Patterson was born on his family's "King's Valley" estate in Rural Benton County, Oregon September 17, 1859. His parrents were emigrants to the Oregon Territory, having made the overland trip from their previous home of Bellvue, Illinois. Until he reached the age of 18, he worked his father's farm. He later attended Monmouth's Christian College, for one year. Patterson supported himself as a grocery clerk in Independence, later earning his way into a position there as a business partner. His participation in the grocery store would last for 22 years.

In 1898, Patterson entered politics, gaining election to a seat in the Oregon State Senate representing Marion County. At the time, he was one of the youngest State Legislators ever elected, having been sworn in at age 32. President William McKinley appointed Patterson to the post of Collector of Customs, Portland District in 1898, and was reappointed by Theodore Roosevelt in 1902, serving there until 1906.

In 1899, Patterson sold off his share in the grocery store, and purchased a 300 acre ranch in rural Polk County. The farm would prove profitable, and paved the way for Patterson's later venture into a successful wool and hide business in Portland.

After serving out his term as Collector of Customs, Patterson managed his business affairs and kept workinng politicaly inside the Republican Party. In 1918, the citizens of Benton and Polk Counties elected him to represent their district, returning him to the State Senate. In the Senate, he moved his way up and served as Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.

Patterson attempted to secure the Republican nomination for Governor in 1922, coming in a distant third in the primary in a six-man race. Despite this poor showing, Patterson had strong ties with the party's old guard. He won the Chairmanship of the Oregon State Republican Party Central Committee in 1924, going on to chair Calvin Coolidge's Presidential campaign in Oregon.

His profile statewide rose, and this secured him the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1926. He would go on to defeat Walter M. Price in that year's general election.

Using President Coolidge as an inspiration, Governor Patterson would govern the state in a financialy conservative manner; streamlining agencies of the state and vetoing legislation which would threaten balancing the state's finances. By 1920, the state balanced its budget for the first time in its history.

His administration notably continued improving state roads and highways, established the state's system of higher education, and directed the state prison system to house adult and juvinile criminals seperately.

He was considered a popular and well-respected figure by rivals and supporters alike, but suddenly died in office of Pneumonia on December 21, 1929. 



A. W. Norblad

Albin Walter Norblad, Sr., (March 18, 1881-April 17, 1960) was a prominent citizen of Astoria, Oregon and the Republican Governor of Oregon from 1929 to 1931.

He was the father of Representative A. Walter Norblad (Albin Walter Norblad, Jr.), Member of the United States House of Representatives, from the 1st Congressional District of Oregon between 1946 and 1964.

Norblad was born in Malmo, Sweden in 1881 to parents Peter and Bessie Youngsberg. The family's last name was changed by the Swedish Government to avoid confusion in military records. The family emigrated to the United States while Albin was very young, settling in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

At age 12, Albin decided to support himself, mostly by means of odd jobs. He would later recount that the most notable jobs held during this time were newsboy, hot dog vendor, and clairinetist for the circuis.

He managed to earn enough money to return to Grand Rapids, taking night classes at the Grand Rapids Business College. After earning enough credits there, Norblad was able enroll at the Chicago Law School, supporting himself as a reporter for the "Chicago American" newspaper's crime beat. Graduating in 1902, he quickly passed the bar exam and moved back to Michigan.

Once in Michigan, he set up a law firm, and was elected District Attorney for Delta County.

While visiting Oregon on business in 1908, Norblad met with an old friend who invited him to live in Astoria. He accepted, and moved with his wife in 1909. He began practicing law, and became involved in the community. His first government office in Oregon was as Astoria's city attorney from 1910 to 1915. He would also become a member of the local school board, and President of the Astoria Chamber of Commerce. Outside of politics, Norblad was involved in many fraternal and civic organizations.

With a prominent local political profile, Norblad went on to run for a seat in the Oregon State Senate, in 1918. Reelected in 1926, he attempted an abortive run for Oregon's At-large U.S. House seat in 1922. He was elected President of the Oregon State Senate in 1927, placing him as second in the state's then-official line of gubernatorial succession.

The death of sitting Governor Isaac Patterson on December 21, 1929 came as a shock to Oregonians. The governor had looked as he'd been recovering since contracting pneumonia late in his third term. Thus Senate President Albin Norblad was sworn promptly as governor. As soon as he was inaugurated, he declared his intent to run for the Republican gubernatorial nomination.

Taking office during the Great Depression, Norblad's first attempts to improve conditions in the state were largely ineffective. Lacking a political identity statewide, and considered a Progressive by conserrvative elements in control of the state Republican party, Norblad was defeated in his primary bid in May 1930, coming in second-place. When the winner of the primary unexpectantly died a month later, Norblad took his name out of the running for the nomination, giving the Republican state central committee his blessing to choose a new candidate.

Freed from having to contest an election, Norblad began focusing his attention on the economic situation in the state. He formed the state's first labor commission, later to become the modern Employment Department. In order to put men back to work, he authorized $2 million worth of road construction, and succeeded in employing 5,000 workers. The Oregon Coast Highway was begun under his leadership. Another $3 million was spent upgrading publicly-owned facilities around the state.

The Governor also took a personal role in pardons and labor disputes. A Pardons Board was established, and Norblad even interviewed pardin-seeking inmates in-person.

In matters involving the rest of the nation, Norblad accepted federal help in solving a long-simmering dispute between Eastern Oregon's cattle and sheep ranchers. The Governor indicated his support for the pending military draft legislation working its way through Congress. He also argued for the state's acquisition of federally-owned forest land.

Defeated in his primary bid, Governor Norblad handed office to the victor of the 1931 gubernatorial election, independent candidate Julius L. Meier.

Norblad went back to practicing law in Astoria, once again becoming closely involved in the community. He founded the Lower Columbia Association of Chambers of Commerce, and gained a $10,000 grant from the descendants of John Jacob Astor for use in the Astoria Centennial Celebration.

Norblad continued his practice and civic activities in Astioria until his death on April 17, 1960.



Julius L. Meier

Julius L. Meier (December 31, 1874 - July 14, 1937) was a businessman in Portland, Oregon, and governor of Oregon. He was born in Portland to German immigrants of Jewish ancestory: Aaron, a merchant and founder of Oregon's largest department store, Meier & Frank, and Jeannette (Hirsch) Meier. He had three siblings, and was the father of Jean Ellen, Elsa Francis, and Julius L., (Jack) Jr.

He married Grace Mayer on Christmas Day, 1901, saying afterwards that it was the only day that he was allowed off from the store.

Meier graduated from the University of Oregon Law School in 1895 and practiced law with a partner, George W. Joseph for the next four years, until he went into the family's business. According to family tradition, it was at this time that he added the "L" to his name; the sign painter, who was putting his name on the door, insisted that all lawyers of substance had one and Meier suggested an "L".

Meier ran for governor as an independent candidate in 1930, winning 54.5 percent of the total vote, outdistancing his nearest competitor, Democratic candidate Edward F. Bailey, 135,608 votes to 62,434. After serving as governor, he retired to his estate above the Columbia River, "Menucha", where he later died.

His family sold Menucha to First Presbyterian Church of Portland in 1950, which now operates it as a conference and retreat center. The Meier and Frank families sold the department store to the May Company in 1966. With May's sale to Federated in 2005, the store was renamed "Macy's" in September, 2006.

Julian Nagelsmann

Julian Nagelsmann (born 23 July 1987) is a German professional football manager and former player who was formerly head coach of Bayern Munich.

Known for his flexibility with formations, maintaining possession, and developing "gegenpress", Nagelsmann is widely known as one of the best young managers in world football.

Nagelsmann was born on 23 July 1987 in Landsberg am Lech, Bavaria. He played for FC Augsburg and 1860 Munich at youth level, and was the captain of Munich's U17 team. In the 2006–07 season, he was part of the second team but could not play a single match due to injuries. Nagelsmann returned to Augsburg for the 2007–08 season coached by Thomas Tuchel, but injured his knee and meniscus for the second time, damaging the cartilage. As a result, he decided to end his footballing career at the age of 20. He had already assisted his head coach Thomas Tuchel as a scout in the first half of 2008. He studied business administration in university for four semesters until he transferred to sports science. Then he focused on coaching, returning to his previous club 1860 Munich as an assistant to Alexander Schmidt for Munich's U17 team from 2008 to 2010.

Nagelsmann joined the 1899 Hoffenheim youth academy in 2010 and coached numerous youth teams in the following years. He was an assistant coach during Hoffenheim's 2012–13 season, and up until 11 February 2016, was coaching the club's U19 team. He coached Hoffenheim's U19 "junior team" to win the 2013–14 Under 19 Bundesliga title. During his time as assistant coach, goalkeeper Tim Wiese referred to Nagelsmann as "Mini-Mourinho."

Nagelsmann was appointed head coach of 1899 Hoffenheim on 27 October 2015. He was expected to begin his tenure at the start of the 2016–17 season. He was given a three-year contract. At the time of his appointment, Nagelsmann was 28, and the youngest coach in Bundesliga history. He was to be the successor for Huub Stevens, who had replaced Markus Gisdol the previous day. On 10 February 2016, Stevens resigned as head coach due to health problems, and Nagelsmann's term as head coach was introduced by the Hoffenheim board a day later.

When Nagelsmann took over the club in February 2016, Hoffenheim were 17th in the table, 7 points from the safety of 15th spot and facing relegation. Under Nagelsmann they avoided relegation by winning 7 of their remaining 14 matches and finished a point above the relegation playoff spot. Their good form continued into the 2016–17 Bundesliga season, where they finished 4th in the table and qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time in their history.

On 9 June 2017, Hoffenheim extended the contract of Nagelsmann until 2021. On 21 June 2018, Hoffenheim announced that Nagelsmann would be leaving the club at the end of the 2018–19 season. He oversaw his 100th league game as manager of Hoffenheim on 19 January 2019, in a 3–1 defeat to Bayern Munich. In doing so, he became the youngest ever Bundesliga manager to reach the 100–match mark.

On 21 June 2019, RB Leipzig announced that Nagelsmann would be their coach from the 2019–20 season and signed a four-year contract which would expire in 2023. Nagelsmann won his first Bundesliga match as RB Leipzig coach against FC Union Berlin 4–0, he also led Leipzig to a 1–1 draw against FC Bayern Munich. On match-day 10 Leipzig won against Mainz 8–0. Nagelsmann faced his former club Hoffenheim on match-day 14 and won 3–1 against them.

On 10 March 2020, following Leipzig's 4–0 win against Tottenham Hotspur, Nagelsmann became the youngest coach in history to win a UEFA Champions League knockout tie.

On 13 August 2020, RB Leipzig defeated Spanish side Atlético Madrid 2–1 in the quarter-finals, meaning Leipzig would progress to the Champions League semi-finals for the first time in their history. Nagelsmann became the youngest coach in history, therefore, to coach a side in the semi-finals.

On 18 August 2020, RB Leipzig played against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League semi-finals, where Nagelsmann faced his former boss during his time at Augsburg, Thomas Tuchel. However, RB Leipzig lost 3–0 to Paris Saint-Germain.

In the 2020–21 season, RB Leipzig finished second in the Bundesliga and lost the DFB-Pokal Final 4–1 against Borussia Dortmund.

On 27 April 2021, Bayern Munich appointed Nagelsmann as head coach on a five-year contract, effective from 1 July 2021, replacing Hansi Flick for a world record manager transfer fee of 25 million Euros. Nagelsmann's first match as Bayern coach was a 1–1 draw against Borussia Mönchengladbach in the Bundesliga.

In Nagelsmann's first win as Bayern coach he won his first title as a coach in Bayern's 3-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund in the 2021 DFL-Supercup.

On 24 August 2021, Nagelsmann led Bayern to a 12–0 victory against Bremer SV during the first round of the 2021–22 DFB-Pokal. The scoreline was their biggest win in 24 years, since their 16–1 victory against DJK Waldberg in the DFB Cup in August 1997.

2017–2018 United States flu season

The 2017-2018 flu season was a flu season of high severity in the United States. Influenza-like illness (ILI) has a high rate of outpatient and emergency clinic visits, and a high rate of influenza-related hospitalizations, and influenza activities have been on the rise for a long period of time and are widely distributed geographically. In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began using a new method to classify seasonal severity and applied the method to the seasons from 2003-2004 to 2016-2017. The 2017-18 season was the first season to be classified as highly serious among all age groups. 

In the 2017-2018 season, influenza-like illness (ILI) activities began to increase in November, and reached a long period of high activity nationwide in January and February, and continued until the end of March. The peak of ILI was 7.5%, the highest percentage since the 2009 influenza pandemic (7.7%). Influenza-like illness (ILI) reached or exceeded the national benchmark for 19 weeks, making 2017-2018 one of the longest seasons in recent years.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there are no reports of childhood flu deaths nationwide. To monitor influenza-related deaths of all ages, the CDC tracks deaths caused by pneumonia and influenza (P&I) through the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) mortality reporting system. The system tracks the proportion of death certificates that list pneumonia or influenza as a potential cause of death. The system provides an overall indication of whether influenza-related mortality has increased, but does not provide an exact number to indicate the number of deaths from influenza. During the 2017-2018 season, the percentage of deaths due to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) reached or exceeded the epidemic threshold for 16 consecutive weeks.

The constitution sets out the framework for the republic of Singapore, including a President, who is elected every six years, and a Prime Minister. The Prime Minister leads the government and is appointed by the President, but is responsible to the Parliament and must be accepted by it. Singapore's constitution is also based on the Westminster system, which means all ministers must be members of Parliament (MPs). If they, including the Prime Minister, are not elected to Parliament, they cannot remain in their position. The judiciary also has a strong role in the constitution, with judges acting independently of the President, the government and the Parliament. Judges are appointed for a long time, and cannot be removed except for misconduct. The highest court is the Supreme Court of Singapore, which was set up in 1970, five years after the constitution. 

Changing the constitution demands a two-thirds majority vote in the Parliament. However, to change the scope and sovereignty of the country, such as becoming a part of Malaysia again, a referendum showing the support of two-thirds of all voters is required. The constitution is changed from time to time, including to create MPs who are not elected in constituencies, i.e. by the voters, but to introduce representation for others who do not get the support of voters. These are called NMPs and NCMPs. In changing the constitution and some other matters, they are not allowed to vote.

Lonely Planet

Lonely Planet is a huge travel guide book creator. , the company had sold 120 million books since creation.

Lonely Planet was created by married couple Maureen and Tony Wheeler. In 1972, they went on a trip through Europe and Asia to Australia.

The company name originates from the misheard "lovely planet" in a song written by Matthew Moore.

Tony returned to Asia to write "Across Asia on the Cheap: A Complete Guide to Making the Overland Trip", created in 1975.

The Lonely Planet guide book series first expanded in Asia, with the India guide book in 1981, and expanded to rest of the world. Geoff Crowther was noticed for frequently inserting his opinions into the text of the guides he wrote. His writing was helpful to the rise of Lonely Planet. The journalist used the word "Geoffness", in tribute to Crowther, to show a quality that has been lost in travel guides.

By 1999, Lonely Planet had sold 30 million copies of its travel guides. The company's creators consequently benefited from profit-sharing and expensive events were held at the Melbourne office, at which limousines would arrive, filled with Lonely Planet workers.

In 2007, the Wheelers and John Singleton sold a 75% stake in the company to BBC Worldwide, worth a guess of £63 million at the time. The company was creating 500 titles and went into television production. BBC Worldwide struggled following the loss, registering a £3.2 million loss in the year to the end of March 2009. By the end of March 2010, profits of £1.9 million had been generated, as digital profits had risen 37% year-on-year over the preceding 12 months, a "Lonely Planet" magazine had grown and non-print profits grew from 9% in 2007 to 22%. 

Lonely Planet's digital presence included 140 apps and 8.5 million unique users for lonelyplanet.com, which made the Thorn Tree travel website forum. BBC Worldwide gained the remaining 25% of the company for £42.1 million (A$67.2 million) from the Wheelers.

By 2012 BBC wanted to sell itself of the company and in March 2013 confirmed the sale of Lonely Planet to Brad Kelley's NC2 Media for US$77.8 million (£51.5 million), at nearly an £80 million (US$118.89 million) loss. 
In April 2020 Lonely Planet made the decision to close its Australian and London offices and lower staffing levels globally in response to the loss in the travel industry resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The company continued to create its guidebooks, phrasebooks, maps, children's books and inspirational picture tutorials but chose to close its magazine.

In December 2020, NC2 Media sold Lonely Planet to Red Ventures for an unknown amount. Lonely Planet offices continue to work in Dublin, New Delhi and Beijing.

Lonely Planet's online community, the Thorn Tree, was created in 1996. It is named for a Naivasha thorn tree ("Acacia xanthophloea") that has been used as a message board for the city of Nairobi, Kenya since 1902. The tree still exists in the Stanley Hotel, Nairobi. It is used by over 600,000 travelers to share their experiences and look for advice. Thorn Tree has many different forum categories including different countries, places to visit depending on one's interests, travel buddies, and Lonely Planet support.

In 2009, Lonely Planet began creating a monthly travel magazine called "Lonely Planet Traveler". It is available in digital versions for a number of countries.

Lonely Planet also had its own television creation company, which has produced series, such as "Globe Trekker", "Lonely Planet Six Degrees", and "Lonely Planet: Roads Less Travelled". Toby Amies and Asha Gill (both British TV presenters) took part in the Lonely Planet Six degrees.

Despite being a country with low crime, political assassination has a long history in . Although not nearly as common before , there have been assassinations post-1945, most notably when 17 year old nationalist killed chairman of the Japan Socialist Party on live TV in 1960.

Japanese assassins occupied a special place in the Japanese psyche. Often times, the sincerity of their beliefs were given consideration, and if they were motivated by selfless causes, their punishments were often less severe than a nonpolitical murder. That being said, this was not the case of all assassinations, with Japanese society far more divided than some postwar historians have portrayed it as, i.e. a regimented military dictatorship.

The assassinations depicted alternate between cold detachment and a sympathetic biopic.

The film set during the 19th and 20th centuries such as the , the , the , and the . Throughout the whole story, it depicts a young assassins who is full of pure and beautiful energy of the dissident and confronts the power of time with the spirit of abandoned stones

Finally, many sources from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam confirmed that there was no such thing as a ""bloody massacre"" in Huế.

In the early morning of January 31, 1968, during the Lunar New Year, the People's Army of Vietnam and the Liberation Army of South Vietnam simultaneously launched a surprise attack in many cities and localities in South Vietnam - in the early morning of January 31, 1968. including Saigon and Huế. After initial military successes, they were overwhelmed by the enemy and pushed back everywhere, except Huế. Although the Tet Offensive was considered a tactical defeat, it was a victory of great strategic importance.

With the aim of seizing sovereignty over Huế, a 28-day battle between the South Vietnamese Liberation Army and the US Army and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam took place and resulted in 40% of the city being destroyed, 116,000 homeless people. The US Army and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam suffered about 4,400 casualties, while the South Vietnamese Liberation Army and the Vietnam People's Army also lost over 4,000 troops. Also in this re-occupation, the US army used maximum heavy weapons such as napalm bombs, cannons, tank cannons and large recoilless guns . Out of 17,134 houses in Huế, 9,776 houses were completely destroyed, 3,169 were severely damaged; The number of civilians killed according to the first estimate of the government of the Republic of Vietnam was 3,776. The South Vietnamese Liberation Army documents said they buried about 2,000 bomb victims in mass graves along with their own dead soldiers.

In the months and years that followed the Battle of Mau Than at Hue, which began on January 31, 1968, and lasted a total of 26 days, dozens of mass graves were discovered in and around Huế. Victims include women, men, children and baby.

According to Gareth Porter, an American scholar, early estimates by the Ministry of Immigration and Social Security of the Republic of Vietnam put the number of civilians killed by fighting and artillery fire at 3,776, out of the total number of civilians. wounded, dead or missing were 6,700 people. Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci in her autographs said that about 1,100 people were killed when the North Vietnamese troops recaptured Huế, most of the people killed were teachers, lectures, university students, monks, intellectuals and religion followers (mostly buddhist). Historian Stanley Karnow believes that many civilians were executed by the North Vietnamese and their bodies were buried in mass graves.

According to Lê Minh, the commander of the campaign for the whole Thừa Thiên Huế area, the Secretary of the Hue City Party Committee during the Tết Offensive, wrote in his memoirs published in 1988, most civilians died due to being hit by American bombs. city, only a small number were killed as civilians rebelled against those they hated.

A Vietnamese witness in Huế, Nguyễn Thị Hoa, said: ""It started with them (US troops) using artillery." "They bombarded the area where we lived, razed houses and trees." "They fired artillery at the houses in the surrounding areas." "These houses sold gasoline, so when the firecrackers were fired, they burned down." "All the elderly, children, and women who took refuge here were burned alive.""

Don Oberdorfer also cited several sources reporting that there were ""revenge teams"" set up by the Republic of Vietnam, which hunted down and executed civilians who had supported the Liberation Army while they were stationed in Huế.

Peranakan

Peranakan refers to mixed Chinese and Malay/Indonesian people. Many Peranakans trace their origins to 15th-century Malacca.

The first Baba-Nyonya originated, from the 15th century, from marriages between Chinese merchants and Malay or Indonesian women.

The Baba-Nyonya partly adopted Malay customs in order to integrate into local communities. During British rule, they acquired a strong influence in the Straits colonies and were even nicknamed the King's Chinese.

Today, their particular identity tends to fade slowly, the younger generation adopting a more standardised Chinese culture.

In Java, Indonesia, the term Peranakan designates the mixed Chinese communities of locals from the cities of Pasisir (north coast of the island). In the Indonesian context, their outward characteristics fadesd all the more as the Indonesians categorized as Chinese properly speaking were forced, during the Soeharto regime (1966-98), to hide outward traces of their identity.

At various times and for various reasons, the Peranakan migrated extensively within the Nusantara region, between Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. This has resulted in a greater homogeneity of this population. The Peranakan culture is losing its positions and its popularity. Due to the political motives of the countries, the Peranakans of Malaysia and Singapore are increasingly approaching the culture of the Chinese on the mainland. At the same time, the Peranakans of Indonesia, due to the long ban on the Chinese language and the persecution of the Chinese during the reign of Suharto, are increasingly losing their native culture.

Baba and Peranakan Chinese speak a Malay creole, "Baba Malay", a mixture of English, Malay and Hokkien (a Chinese dialect).

Migrations to neighboring countries led to the emergence of small Peranakan communities in Vietnam and Australia .

Playing for Time (movie)

Playing for Time is a made-for-television movie about the Holocaust. Arthur Miller wrote the movie. He based it on Fania Fénelon's true book about her life, called "The Musicians of Auschwitz". The movie was on television on CBS in 1980.

At the Auschwitz death camp, the Nazis choose women who can sing and play instruments to make music for them. They become the Women's Orchestra of Auschwitz. The women see the things that happen in the camp and try to stay alive long enough for the war to end.

The title comes from the English expression "playing for time" which means to stall or delay something bad from happening and the word "playing" as in playing an instrument. The women in "Playing for Time" are playing music so that the Nazis won't kill them yet.

Critics said the movie was "the best script [Miller] has written in years." The movie won many Emmys, a Golden Globe and the Peabody Award.

People did not like that directors chose Vanessa Redgrave to be Fania Fénelon. Redgrave did not like Israel and was pro-Palestine. Fénelon herself said that Redgrave was too tall and did not have a good sense of humor, which she said was one way she stayed alive in the camp. She wanted Liza Manelli instead of Redgrave.

Other members of the women's orchestra said that not all of Fénelon's story was true: They said that Alma Rosé had not been as bad as Fénelon said. They said Fénelon's story made it look like she had saved their lives when really Rosé had saved their lives. Some of the women also said they did not like that very private moments in their lives were in a movie for everyone to see.


Arthur Miller also wrote a play "Playing for Time", but it was after the movie, not before.

2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses

The 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses were the first votes to decide the nominee in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries for the 2020 United States presidential election, taking place on 3 February 2020. The winner was Pete Buttigieg, which made him the first openly gay person to win a presidential contest. The Iowa caucuses are closed caucuses, only allowing for people who are registered in the Democratic Party to vote. Iowa gives 49 delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention, of which 41 are pledged delegates given to candidates based on the results of the caucuses.

After a three day delay in reporting the votes, the Iowa Democratic Party announced that Buttigieg had been awarded two more delegates than Sanders, but Sanders had won the popular vote in the state. Most of the media outlets would say that Buttigieg would be the winner, but the Associated Press declined to declare who would be the winner until all recount voting processes had been finished. The official result and calculation of pledged delegates was delayed again by a further six days after the election as they needed to correct the results from 3.1% (55) of the precincts. Both Buttigieg and Sanders then requested a recanvass for 8.1% of the official results, which narrowed Buttigieg's lead over Sanders to 0.08 state delegate equivalents.

The caucuses would be controversial because of the delays in the reporting of the results. Much of the delay was as a result of the mobile application used to report voting totals. More controversy started because of the errors and continued changing in the calculation and reporting of the state delegate equivalents. The Iowa Democratic Party chair would resign on the 12 February 2020 because of the criticism of the reporting.

By July 2016, when Theresa May became prime minister, he had developed a reputation of being "violent" in his interactions with other local mousers, especially the Foreign Office's much younger cat Palmerston. His Prime Minister's are David Cameron and Boris Johnson. And his monarch is Elizabeth II.

Since being a kitten, Larry has been in good health and has lived over the average of other cats. 

In January 2016 Larry had suffered an infection, which he later recovered from. 

On the 24th September 2023, it was reported that Larry was seriously ill. 10 Downing Street are currently in the process of preparing his death.

Larry is a rescued stray cat from the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home who was chosen by Downing Street staff. Larry was intended to be a pet for the children of David and Samantha Cameron, and was described by Downing Street sources as a "good ratter" and as having "a high chase-drive and hunting instinct". In 2012, Battersea Dogs and Cats Home revealed that Larry's popularity had resulted in a surge of 15% more people adopting cats.

The Downing Street website describes Larry's duties as "greeting guests to the house, inspecting security defences, and testing antique furniture for napping quality". It says he is "contemplating a solution to the mouse occupancy of the house" and has told Downing Street that such a solution is still in the "tactical planning stage".

Unlike his predecessors since 1929, Larry's upkeep is funded by the staff of 10 Downing Street. Fund-raising events to pay for his food are believed to have included a quiz night for Downing Street staff held in the state rooms.

He made his first known kill – a mouse – on 22 April 2011. On 28 August 2012, Larry made his first public killing, dropping his prey on the lawn in front of Number 10. In October 2013, Larry caught four mice in two weeks and one staff member rescued a mouse from his clutches.

In July 2015, George Osborne and Cabinet Office Minister Matt Hancock cornered a mouse in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's office, trapping it in a brown paper sandwich bag. The press joked that the Chancellor of the Exchequer might take over the Chief Mouser position. Freya (cat) is the queen

David Cameron explained during his final Prime Minister's Questions in 2016 that Larry is a civil servant and not personal property, so would not leave Downing Street after a change of premier. Larry has retained his position with the Boris Johnson administration.

On 19 March 2014, it was announced that the popular BBC long-running continuous drama "EastEnders," had cast Hammond in the role of disabled market trader Donna Yates. The character of Donna was not originally going to be written into "EastEnders" as a disabled character, but Hammond impressed bosses at her audition, and was awarded the part. Donna is the second disabled regular in the soap, after Adam Best (David Proud) who left the show in 2010. Speaking of her casting, Hammond said: "I'm really excited to join the cast of "EastEnders". It's a great opportunity to be a part of such a big and popular show. Donna is a bit of a handful but they're always the most fun characters to play! It feels good to be bad!" Donna's storylines have included: her fierce attitude, which often runs her into arguments; the introduction of her family; and a relationship with Fatboy (Ricky Norwood). Lisa decided to leave the soap in 2018 to pursue other roles. Her last appearance in "EastEnders" was on 20 July 2018, when Donna was seen leaving in the back of a black cab.

Hammond grew up with a restricted growth condition. She revealed in October 2015 that she has received abuse from strangers in the street because of her disability. She spoke about how her wheelchair use received backlash from the public. "The main image of wheelchair users is that of paralysis. So when I get out of my chair to do a scene on my feet, people don't like it. If I'm feeling good and want to walk in that scene, I will. But if I can't or pain levels are bad then I'll use my chair. I've been shouted at. I've had people say, 'Oi, why are you in a chair when you were walking on "EastEnders" last night?'" Hammond also revealed how she had received criticism like this before joining "EastEnders" and that she can struggle with this backlash. "People always think I'm this feisty girl and I can hold my own but in those moments you just don't think of anything to say. It's shock and disbelief. I have to laugh it off."

On 7 September 2017, she participated in the documentary series "Who Do You Think You Are?" and discovered that her maternal side originally came from Wales.

Blind Ambition

"Blind Ambition" is the 3rd episode of "Family Guy"s 4th season. It was first broadcast on the Fox network on May 15, 2005. The episode was written by Steve Callaghan and Chuck Klein is the director of the episode. The episode is about Peter Griffin going blind after trying to get a world record.

Mort Goldman gets popular for getting the highest possible score in bowling. Lois goes to the bowling alley and is shocked to see Glenn Quagmire watching her in a bathroom. Quagmire gets arrested but is freed by his neighbor Joe Swanson. Lois and other wives in her neighborhood want Quagmire taken away from the neighborhood. They later say they will let him stay if he stops harassing women. They help Quagmire control himself using operant conditioning (learning about the consequences of one's behaviors). They take Quagmire to a shopping mall. Quagmire sees cheerleaders in a fountain and starts to feel worried. He finds a room with video cameras of women in changing rooms. He sees a woman having a heart attack in one of the cameras. He runs to the woman and does CPR. Quagmire gets awarded for saving the woman from dying. 

Peter feels sad because his friends have had success, but he says he has not. He thinks he will be famous if he gets a world record for eating the most nickels. He tries to eat many nickels, but gets poisoned and goes blind. Peter gets a guide dog and goes to a bar. He ties the dog's leash to a homeless person thinking it is a parking meter. He goes to the bar and does not know it is burning. He saves the bartender from the fire and is called a hero by a news anchor. Peter gets new eyes from the homeless person he tied his guard dog to.

"Family Guy" was first cancelled after its 3rd season. 5 scripts were made in 2001 for if "Family Guy" was brought back by the Fox network. "Blind Ambition" was made from one of the scripts. This is the second episode where Peter and Ernie the Giant Chicken get in a fight. This was supposed to be shown in the episode "The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire". That episode was too long to show them fighting, so it was put in "Blind Ambition". Some parts of this episode were made but not broadcast. One of these was during Quagmire trying to control himself, where Brian Griffin uses a forklift to carry pornographic magazines away from Quagmire's house.

Many people called David Goodman to say they did not like blind Peter seducing his son Chris thinking he is Lois. Chris Sheridan said that people were also not happy with Quagmire watching Lois in the bathroom. The Fox network can not use the words "Jesus Christ" if they are not talking about Jesus himself. One part of the episode shows God saying "Jesus Christ!" when he accidentally kills a person. Jesus was put in the episode with God so that the part of the episode can be broadcast.

The episode was seen by about 9.26 million people when it was first broadcast.

Kevin Wong from "PopMatters" said that the episode was better than the 4th season's first two episodes. Mike Drucker from IGN thought that Peter and Ernie's fight was funny in the first episode they were in, but said it was not interesting this time. However, Drucker liked the reference to "Star Wars" at the end of the episode.

Omega-6 fatty acid

Omega-6 fatty acids are a family of polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Some medical research notes that high levels of omega-6 fatty acids from seed oils may increase the chance for a number of diseases. However, having non-rancid nuts, which are high in omega-6, is associated with lower risk for some diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, stroke, heart attacks and certain cancers.

Modern Western diets often have ratios of omega-6 to omega 3 higher than 10. Some are as high as 30. The normal ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 in the Western diet is 15–16.7, mainly from vegetable oils.

Vegetable oils are a major source of omega-6 linoleic acid. Worldwide, more than 100 million metric tons of vegetable oils are extracted annually from palm fruits, soybean seeds, rape seeds, and sunflower seeds, providing more than 32 million metric tons of omega-6 linoleic acid and 4 million metric tons of omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid.

Dietary sources of omega-6 fatty acids include:

Omega-3 fatty acid

Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids. They have a double bond three atoms away from the end methyl group.

The most common sources for plant oils are walnuts, hemp oil and flaxseed oil. Sources of animal omega-3 fats include eggs, squid oils and fish.

Dietary supplementation does not affect the risk of cancer, heart disease or death.

They are not a main treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism and other developmental disabilities. However, omega-3 supplements are often given to children with these conditions.

Chicken as food

Chicken is the most common type of poultry around the world. It is prepared in a number ways, including boiling, baking, frying and grilling. Prepared chicken became a staple for fast food in the second half of the 20th century. Chicken is often said to be more healthful than red meat. It has less cholesterol and saturated fat.

Chicken as a meat first began in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC. Chicken was one of the most common meats available during the Middle Ages.

In the United States in the 1800s, chicken was more expensive than other meats. Chicken consumption in the United States increased during World War II due to there not being enough beef and pork. In Europe, chicken was more than that of beef and veal in 1996 because of the consumer awareness of mad cow disease.

Modern varieties of chicken, like the Cornish Cross, are bred specifically for meat production. The most common breeds of chicken consumed in the United States are the White Rock and the Cornish. 

Chickens raised mainly for food are called broilers. In the United States, broilers are usually butchered at a young age.


Chicken meat has two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured as weight percentage.

Perkele

Perkele () is a swear word in Finnish that means "evil spirit" or a version of "god damn". It is popular, and is most likely the most known Finnish curse word in the world.

The name is Indo-European. Perkwunos is the reconstructed name of the god of thunder. Other gods said to have the same origin include Perkūnas (Lithuania), Pērkons (Latvia), Percunis (Prussia), Piarun (Belarus), Peko or Pekolasõ (Estonia), Parjanya (India), Fairguneis (Gothic), and Perun or Piorun (Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Serbia, Slovakia and Slovenia).

Some researchers think "Perkele" is an original name of the thunder god Ukko, the chief god of the Finnish pagan pantheon. There are related words in other Finnic languages. In Estonian, "põrgu" means hell and in Karelian, "perkeleh" means an evil spirit.

It has been used as a curse as a cry for the god for strength. It still is a common curse word in colloquial Finnish. Finnish people use the word to be more serious and powerful than less powerful curses. When the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland held a contest to nominate the "most energizing" word in the Finnish language, one of the suggestions was Perkele because "it is the curse word that gave the most strength for the reconstruction of Finland after the wars."

As Finland was Christianized, the old Finnish deities were said to be demons, so "Devil" was translated to "Perkele" for the Finnish translation of the Bible. Some later translations use "paholainen" (the evil one) instead.

Sea of Japan naming dispute

There is a body of water between the Japanese islands, Russia, North and South Korea. The countries affected have not been able to agree on a common name for this body of water. So far, most countries called it "Sea of Japan". North and South Korea do not want this name, they suggested to call it "East Sea", or "East Sea of Korea". In 1992, both Koreas raised concerns about the name, at the Sixth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names. The Japanese government says that only the name "Sea of Japan" (日本海) should be used. South Korea supports the alternative name "East Sea" (Korean: 동해; Hanja: 東海). North Korea supports the name "East Sea of Korea" (Korean: 조선동해; Hanja: 朝鮮東海). Currently, most international maps and documents use either the name Sea of Japan (or a translation) by itself, or include both the name Sea of Japan and East Sea. Very often, the name East Sea is listed in parentheses or otherwise marked as an alternative. The International Hydrographic Organization is responsible for naming bodies of water around the world. In 2012, it decided it was still unable to change the 1953 version of its publication S-23 – Limits of Oceans and Seas, which includes only the single name "Sea of Japan", to include "East Sea" together with "Sea of Japan".

The countries have given different arguments, for their naming proposition, but each name has its problems:


The International Hydrographic organisation made a resolution in 1974. In this resolution, it stated that in the case that the countries cannot agree on a common name for a body of water, all names should be accepted. However, Japan argues that the resolution only applies to the bays and straits which are shared by multiple countries, and in case of high seas such as the Sea of Japan, it is not applicable. Japan also cites the United Nations’ policy for using the Sea of Japan as an official name for their reasoning.

Directed graph

In graph theory, a directed graph (or digraph) is a graph which has directed edges. This means one end of the edge is different from the other end. Directed edges can be thought of as arrows, or as edges which can only be travelled in one direction.

For a normal graph, the degree of a vertex formula_1 is the number of edges touching formula_1.

For a digraph, there are two more definitions. The "indegree" of formula_1 is the number of edges going into formula_1, and the "outdegree" of formula_1 is the number of edges going out of formula_1.

2012–13 North American drought

The 2012–13 North American drought was caused by less than normal snowfall the previous winter. Also, La Niña-related heat waves were taking place in the Midwestern and Western United States.

Nikkatsu

The Nikkatsu Corporation (日活株式会社, "Nikkatsu Kabushiki-gaisha") is a Japanese entertainment company known for its film and television productions. It is Japan's oldest major movie studio, founded in 1912 during the silent film era. The name Nikkatsu amalgamates the words Nippon Katsudō Shashin, literally "Japan Motion Pictures".

Nikkatsu's history dates back as early as 1912 when 4 companies merged to form Nippon Katsudo Shashin Corporation, the first film conglomerate in the region to produce, distribute and exhibit theatrical films. In 1952 Chofu Studio was built in Tokyo as the largest modern film studio in the Asia Pacific Region at the time; the studio even had a permanent set of Ginza city. It quickly became the cornerstone of the company's Golden Era, together with its string of attractive stars who were then all exclusive to Nikkatsu; the legendary superstar Yujiro Ishihara, handsome young actors under the "Nikkatsu New Face" banner including Akira Kobayashi and Joe Shishido; actresses such as Sayuri Yoshinaga and Ruriko Asaoka; and directors Seijun Suzuki and Shohei Imamura. Nikkatsu was the leading studio in Japan, enjoying box office mega-hits with its action films starring Ishihara ("Crazed Fruit"), teenage love stories starring Yoshinaga ("Cupola, Where the Furnaces Grow"), and "Branded to Kill" starring Joe Shishido, works with a continuing international appeal to this day - the films were so successful that Ishihara and Yoshinaga are still regarded as icons of the Showa period.

When cinema attendance began to drop, Japanese studios slashed their annual film production. Nikkatsu, however, took a unique turn in 1971 when it launched the "Nikkatsu Roman Porn" brand, namely films for the adult audience. As one director recalls, "I had total creative freedom, as long as I kept some nudity in the film", the brand enabled Nikkatsu to be the only major studio in Japan at the time to continue producing films and hire young film makers. Thus, Nikkatsu soon became the hub for upcoming innovative talents, and many of the directors who were given this rare opportunity, later became dominant film makers in Japan; amongst them are Oscar winner Youjiro Takita ("Departure"), multi-time Japanese Academy winners Masayuki Suo ("Shall We Dance?"), Yoshimitsu Morita, Youichi Sai, Shinji Soumai, and many more. The brand continued until 1988.

In 2005, Naoki Sato was appointed President of the company. Originally a producer himself, Nikkatsu's recent array of titles under his leadership includes cutting-edge genre films by Sion Sono and Takashi Miike, and dramatical masterpieces. They have been highly acclaimed, including numerous Japanese Academy winners and nominees such as "Rebirth", "Cold Fish" and "The Devil's Path".
Today, Nikkatsu's business activities include operation of the production studio, overseas film acquisition, distribution, a cable TV channel (Channel NECO) and a Film Course at Josai International University. It is also a member of the Yomiuri-Nippon TV group, the leading media conglomerate in Japan.

In today's fast evolving market, Nikkatsu has a focus on international activities - in 2014, the company established Kantana Japan, a JV with a Thai production group - and seeks to work more closely with partners outside the industry and around the globe.

Adenocarcinoma of the lung

Lung adenocarcinoma is one kind of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Technicians tell lung adenocarcinoma from other cancers by looking at cells under a microscope. Lung adenocarcinoma starts in glandular cells, which make for example mucus. Lung adenocarcinoma usually grows in smaller airways, such as alveoli, the pockets at the ends of the lung. Lung adenocarcinoma is usually located more along the outer edges of the lungs. Lung adenocarcinoma tends to grow more slowly than other lung cancers.

Planned obsolescence

Planned obsolescence (also called built-in obsolescence or premature obsolescence) is an idea in economics and product design. Planned obsolescence is when someone makes a product so that it will wear out after only a short time. It will either stop working, work much worse than before, or be unfashionable. This way, the person who bought the product must buy a new one sooner than if the old product had lasted a long time. This is often called ""shortening the replacement cycle.""

Planned obsolescence works when company selling the product has few or no other companies making the same product, because the consumer has few choices. Before choosing this strategy, the producer has to make sure that the consumer will likely buy from them again and not from someone else. Usually, there is information asymmetry: the producer knows how long the product was designed to last, and the consumer does not. However, when many companies make the same product, they compete. Then product lifespans often increase. In the 1960s and 1970s, the first Japanese cars were sold in America. Because they had longer lifespans than the American car models, American car manufacturers were forced to build cars that lasted longer.

In 1924, the American market for cars became saturated. That meant that almost everyone who could buy a car had already bought one. In order to still sell about the same number of cars, Alfred P. Sloan Jr. who worked at General Motors suggested that new cars should look different every year. This way, at least some car owners would buy a new car every year. This idea was not new. It had already been tried with bicycles, but people say it was Sloan's idea. Sloan often used the words "dynamic obsolescence", but people who did not like the idea called it "planned obsolescence".

This plan changed many things in the automobile industry, product design field and eventually the whole American economy. Smaller companies could not afford to re-style their car models every year. Henry Ford did not like the idea either. Ford was an engineer, and he liked simplicity, economies of scale, and strong design. In 1931, GM sold more cars than Ford and became the strongest company making cars. Changing the design every year meant GM had to use a body-on-frame structure rather than the lighter unibody design used by most European automakers because unibody is harder to change.

The words "planned obsolescence" were first seen in print in 1932 in Bernard London's pamphlet "Ending the Depression Through Planned Obsolescence". London said the government should tell manufacturers of personal-use items to use planned obsolescence so people would always buy them. However, the phrase became famous in 1954 because of Brooks Stevens, an American industrial designer. Stevens was due to give a talk at an advertising conference in Minneapolis in 1954. Without giving it much thought, he used the term as the title of his talk. From that point on, "planned obsolescence" became Stevens' catchphrase. Stevens said planned obsolescence was "Instilling in the buyer the desire to own something a little newer, a little better, a little sooner than is necessary."

Other people quickly began to use the phrase. By the late 1950s, "planned obsolescence" had become a common term for products designed to break easily or to quickly go out of style. The idea of planned obsolescence was so widely known that, in 1959, Volkswagen made jokes about it in an advertising campaign. Volkswagen tried to make it look as though it did not use planned obsolescence: "We do not believe in planned obsolescence," the ads said. "We don't change a car for the sake of change." In the famous Volkswagen advertising campaign by Doyle Dane Bernbach, one advert showed an almost blank page with the line "No point in showing the 1962 Volkswagen, it still looks the same."

In 1960, cultural critic Vance Packard wrote "The Waste Makers", which was meant to be an exposé of "the systematic attempt of business to make us wasteful, debt-ridden, permanently discontented individuals." Packard divided planned obsolescence into two sub categories: obsolescence of desirability and obsolescence of function.

"Obsolescence of desirability," a.k.a. "psychological obsolescence," referred to marketers' attempts to wear out a product in the owner's mind. Packard quoted industrial designer George Nelson, who wrote:"Design... is an attempt to make a contribution through change. When no contribution is made or can be made, the only process available for giving the illusion of change is 'styling!'"

2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship

The 2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship was the 20th edition of the UEFA European Under-21 Championship. The champions were Sweden.

Qualification for the final tournament of the 2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship consisted of two rounds: a group stage and a play-off round. The group stage draw took place on 31 January 2013 in Nyon, Switzerland, and distributed 52 national teams into ten groups of five or six teams. Each group was contested in a double round-robin system, where teams played each other twice, at home and away. The ten group winners and the four best second-placed teams advanced to the play-off round, where they were paired by draw into seven two-legged ties. The play-off winners joined the Czech Republic in the final tournament.

The following teams qualified for the 2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship final tournament:

The competition was played at four venues in three host cities: Eden Arena and Generali Arena (in Prague), Andrův stadion (in Olomouc), and Stadion Miroslava Valenty (in Uherské Hradiště).

The match officials of the tournament:

The draw for the final tournament took place at 18:00 CET on 6 November 2014, at the Clarion Congress Hotel in Prague. England, the highest-ranked team according to the competition coefficient rankings, and the host team, Czech Republic, were seeded and automatically assigned to separate groups. The second and third-ranked teams in the coefficient rankings, Italy and Germany, were also seeded and drawn into separate groups, while the four unseeded teams were drawn into the remaining positions of the two groups.

Each national team had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom had to be goalkeepers. If a player was injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he could be replaced by another player.

The eight finalists were drawn into two groups of four teams. As hosts, Czech Republic were seeded in group A, while England, the best-ranked team in the UEFA coefficient ranking, were seeded in group B. In each group, teams played matches against each other in a round-robin system, and the top two teams advanced to the semi-finals.

The provisional schedule was released by UEFA on 10 November 2014, and confirmed on 2 December 2014. All times are in Central European Summer Time ().

After the conclusion of the group stage, the following four teams from UEFA qualified for the Olympic football tournament.

If two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied:


If, after having applied criteria 1 to 3, teams still had an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 3 were reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams in question to determine their final rankings. If this procedure did not lead to a decision, criteria 4 to 6 were applied.

If only two teams were tied (according to criteria 1–5) after having met in the last match of the group stage, their ranking would have been determined by a penalty shoot-out.

2021 UEFA Champions League Final

The 2021 UEFA Champions League Final was the final match of the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League, the 66th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 29th season since it was renamed from the European Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto, Portugal on 29 May 2021, between English clubs Manchester City, in their first European Cup final, and 2012 winners Chelsea. This was the third all-English final in the competition, after the 2008 and 2019 finals. 

The final was originally scheduled to be played at the Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg, Russia. However, due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final to Lisbon as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, the final hosts were moved back a year, with the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey instead planning to host the 2021 final. Two weeks before the final, UEFA announced that it would be relocated to Porto to allow a limited number of fans to attend the match. A capacity limit of 33% was agreed for the 50,000-seater Estádio do Dragão, resulting in an attendance of 14,110.

Chelsea won the final 1–0 for their second UEFA Champions League title, with Kai Havertz scoring the only goal of the game late in the first half. As winners, they earned the right to play against the winners of the 2020–21 UEFA Europa League, Villarreal, in the 2021 UEFA Super Cup, and also qualified for the 2021 FIFA Club World Cup, both of which they won.

"In the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup era, since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League era."

The match was the fourth European Cup/Champions League final to take place in Portugal, and the first to take place outside Lisbon, which previously hosted finals in 1967 at the Estádio Nacional and in 2014 and 2020 at the Estádio da Luz. This was the first time the European Cup/Champions League final took place in the same country in successive seasons. The Estádio do Dragão previously hosted matches at UEFA Euro 2004 and the 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals. Additionally, this final was the first since 2004 to be held in a stadium with capacity lower than 60,000.

An open bidding process was launched on 22 September 2017 by UEFA to select the venues of the finals of the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and UEFA Women's Champions League in 2020. Associations had until 31 October 2017 to express interest, and bid information must be submitted by 1 March 2018. Associations hosting matches at UEFA Euro 2020 were not allowed to bid for the 2020 UEFA Champions League final.

UEFA announced on 3 November 2017 that two associations had expressed interest in hosting the 2020 UEFA Champions League final.

The Atatürk Olympic Stadium was selected by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Kyiv on 24 May 2018.

On 17 June 2020, the UEFA Executive Committee announced that due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final to the Estádio da Luz, Istanbul would instead host the 2021 final.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, Premier League side Aston Villa offered to have Villa Park in Birmingham as the venue for the Champions League Final instead of Istanbul to hold 8,000 English fans, which could be affected by travel limitations. Villa Park has previously hosted the 1999 Cup Winners' Cup Final, the last final of that UEFA competition. It also hosted the 2012 FA Community Shield, also contested between Manchester City and Chelsea, due to Wembley Stadium – England's national stadium – hosting the Olympic football tournament finals in the previous days, being picked in part because of its equal distances between Manchester and London. On 7 May 2021, Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps advised against any fans traveling to Turkey for the game.

In negotiations with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, UEFA would only consider Wembley as a potential venue within the United Kingdom, and required guarantees that their officials, sponsors and journalists would be exempt from the UK COVID-19 travel restrictions. The British Government was unable to agree to this, and on 13 May 2021, UEFA announced the final was relocated to the Estádio do Dragão in Porto, Portugal, a country that was on the British "green list" for unrestricted travel during the pandemic.

Manchester City were playing in their first European Cup/UEFA Champions League final. They had previously played in one European final, the 1970 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, and won. They became the ninth English side to play in a European Cup/UEFA Champions League final. This was the third UEFA Champions League final for manager Pep Guardiola, and his first since the two wins with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, both against Manchester United. City were seeking to become the first club to win its first European Cup/UEFA Champions League final since Borussia Dortmund in 1997, which seven clubs had failed to do in between.

Chelsea were playing in their third European Cup/UEFA Champions League final, and the first since their win in 2012 away against Bayern Munich. In addition, they had previously played in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Europa League finals twice each – winning all. In addition, Chelsea became the first club ever to see its men's and women's teams reach the Champions League final in the same season, having qualified for the 2021 UEFA Women's Champions League Final as well. Head coach Thomas Tuchel became the first manager to reach the European Cup/UEFA Champions League final in successive seasons with different clubs, having lost the 2020 final to Bayern Munich while coaching Paris Saint-Germain.

This was the third all-English final in the history of the competition, after 2008 in Moscow between Chelsea and Manchester United and 2019 in Madrid between Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur. This was also the third consecutive Champions League final to feature a first-time finalist, after Tottenham in 2019 and Paris Saint-Germain in 2020.

This was the third meeting between the teams in Europe, having previously met in the semi-finals of the 1970–71 European Cup Winners' Cup, where Chelsea won both legs 1–0 en route to their first European trophy. It was also the second major cup final between them, after the 2019 EFL Cup Final, which City won on penalties following a goalless draw after extra time. The teams met twice during the season's Premier League, with each side winning away: City won the first match 3–1 at Stamford Bridge, while Chelsea won the second 2–1 at Etihad Stadium three weeks before the final. Three weeks before the second league encounter, Chelsea also beat City 1–0 in the FA Cup semi-finals, denying City the chance of winning an unrivaled quadruple.

"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away)."

Blanco was the first-ever billionaire female criminal. She was in charge of her multi-billion dollar drug trafficking business.

Blanco first started the drug trade business in the mid-1970s. She was indicted in April 1975 on federal drug conspiracy charges.

Drug lord

A drug lord, also called a drug kingpin is a criminal boss who controls a sizable network of the people involved in the illegal drug trade. Such people are often hard to bring to justice, for they are not usually in possession of something illegal.

Examples of drug lords are Pablo Escobar, Griselda Blanco, Frank Lucas, Joaquín Guzmán and Manuel Noriega.

Drug lords have started breaking the larger drug cartels into much smaller groups. With newer technology, drug lords are able to manage their business better from behind the scenes. They usually keep themselves off the FBI and DEA lists. The smaller drug cartels are proving to be safer and make more money for those involved.

Intifada

Intifada (Arabic: انتفاضة) is an Arabic word. In Arabic, intifada means "shaking off". An intifada can be seen as a way for people to "shake off" a power that is oppressing them, a so called "uprising" against that power. The term Intifada is most famous for the two Palestinian uprisings in the 1980s and 2000s. These two intifadas are considered part of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There were also other intifadas outside of Palestine, the protests in Bahrain against British presence from 1965 until 1972 are called the 'March Intifada'. 
The First Intifada took place from 1987 to 1993, when Palestinians rebelled against the Israeli power.

The Second Intifada began in 2000 and lasted until 2005. This Intifada is sometimes called the Al-Aqsa Intifada and was also where Palestinians rebelled against the Israeli power.

The March Intifada in Bahrain broke out in March 1965 and protests were renewed every year until 1972. This Intifada was about people from Bahrain against the British power.

The period of the first Intifada started on 9 December 1987 and ended with the in 1993. This Intifada lasted a total of six years.

The Palestinian unrest which led to the outbreak of the first intifada started with the Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory, forcing Palestinians to leave their land. Other reasons for the Palestinian rebellion were the worsening economy and the limited access to jobs.

The first protests against Israel's occupation erupted in Gaza. A car belonging to the Israeli army drove into a Palestinian car, killing all four occupants on 8 December 1987. That night, protests broke out in a Palestinian refugee camp during the funeral of the victims. It became a Palestinian mass uprising against the occupation, Palestinians came into active resistance.

A party (Unified National Leadership of the Uprising: ) was established which brought together all important Palestinian organizations and parties that already opposed Israel before the Intifada.

The first Intifada is often known for its nonviolent nature. The nonviolent resistance from Palestinians existed of the boycott of Israeli products, strikes and the refusal to pay taxes or other obligated payments to Israel. However, the idea that the intifada was nonviolent is not correct. The more violence Palestinians used the more violent the Israeli responses became.

In 1989 the Israeli security forces switched to extreme violent tactics in this period. The Israeli tactics from this period led to a peak in Palestinian violence as well.

An estimated number of 1282 Palestinians died and more than 130.472 became injured during the six year period of the Intifada. For every three Palestinians that died, less than one Israeli was killed.

The Intifada officially ended on the 13th of September 1993, when the was signed by the PLO and Israeli government. This declaration was also the start of the Oslo accords, in which Palestine and Israel would start to discuss the many issues on autonomy, borders, refugees and Jerusalem.

The period of the Second Intifada is marked from September 2000 until February 2005, even though opinions may differ about when it ended. The Second Intifada was more violent than the first.

After the First Intifada ended in 1993, there was still a lot of discontent among the Palestinians. They didn't agree with how the Oslo accords were followed by Israel. When the Israeli premier Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in a provocative way, it was the last straw for the Palestinians. This is why some people also call this uprising the 'Al-Aqsa Intifada'.

The Second Intifada began with Palestinian demonstrations. These started in Jerusalem, but quickly spread to the West Bank. In the beginning the Palestinians mostly threw rocks and were not obedient towards the Israelis, the Israelis were heavily armed.

Later on, the Palestinians used other, more deadly tactics. Some of them were suicide bombings, snipers and rocket attacks.

In 2002, during the Second Intifada, the Israeli government decided to build a barrier between Israel and the West Bank.

Another important event during the Second Intifada was the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. This happened after things escalated between Hamas and the Israeli occupiers, which resulted in many deaths on both sides.

In 2005, after more than 5 years, the Second Intifada came to an end. In 2004 the intensity of the uprising was already fading. This was because of the Palestinians becoming weary, struggling against the strong lasting Israeli defense.

The Second Intifada was more violent than the first one, causing over 3000 Palestinian and nearly 1000 Israeli deaths.

In March 1965 an Intifada broke out in Bahrain. The goal of the uprising was to stop the British presence in Bahrain. This Intifada was mostly led by groups with leftists ideas. Multiple people died, because of the violence the police used several times during the demonstrations. The protests started when a huge amount of workers from the Bahrain Petroleum company resigned. It changed fast into a general strike against the British.

The protests continued to happen annually until 1972. In 1972 the government agreed to talk with the opposition and they allowed three members from the workers union to join the government. The Bahrain Intifada took officially from 1965 to 1975.

"Darter" is a term that refers to they way these birds catch fish: They impale the fish with their beak. The American darter is sometimes called "anhinga". Sometimes it is called water turkey, even though it is unrelated to the turkey.

Economies of scale

In economics, economies of scale means that when more units of a product are made at the same time, the cost it takes to produce a single unit will go down. When making a product, there is a maximum capacity that can be made, at a given time. This capacity depends on the ways in which the product is made. If it is made by machines, these machines have a maximum number they can produce. Wanting to produce more than this number means new machines (or a new way to make these products) are needed. Adam Smith first had this idea of economy of scale, which he obtained through division of labour. 

The opposite of economies of scale are diseconomies of scale.

The Spiders: Go Forward!

These Japanese Group Sounds band, the Spiders star in this rare, "Help! inspired" rock n roll spy movie! If you like screams, shouts, whoops, and hollers in your 1960s jangle rock n roll, this movie is for you. The story development is similar. The Spiders starred in a popular band rather than the general public in the previous film. It was made into a direct video in the 1980s, but it was made into a DVD in 2005, the screen was remastered, and a trailer was added to the privilege. The rental ban was lifted at TUTAYA in 2014.

Seven members of The Spiders have returned to Japan after their tour in Britain. Massaki was proudly holding a tambourine with a jewelry in his hand, but a man with dark glasses and Miyoko were watching them. In addition, neither the band nor their manager Ogata and his daughter Yuriko noticed that the attache case was mistaken switched due to the crowded fans at the airport.

The first incident was when the tambourine was stolen in the dressing room, but no one noticed it. However, other incidents occurred one after another. When Akitomo was attacked by a thug and his companion's room was devastated, the Spiders knew for the first time that they were being targeted by someone. The seven members recognized Miyoko at every performance venue, but only thought she was a fan. On the other hand, the police, who was contacted and set out to investigate, was at a loss because they could not get any clues or evidence. Feeling dangerous, the band moved to the hotel and eventually left for Kagoshima in the midst of this turmoil.

Yuriko comforted the band who tend to sink, but again, they were also targeted by thieves in Kagoshima learned that the enemy's aim was a tambourine containing a diamond inside. Also, since a secret document appeared from the case that should contain the score, they knew that this was also the cause of the target. Then, a masked man threatened Yuriko with a silenced pistol and tried to find out where the case was killed by someone, and it was found that there were two pairs of enemies. After consulting with Ogata, the Spiders returned to Tokyo and planned to lure two sets of villains with the help of detectives. A man with dark glasses and Miyoko who took the invitation, and the Minegishi's Crew trying to recover important secret documents were surrounded by police officers who rushed into the scene. Miyoko tried to escape by car but crashed into a concrete wall. He was trying to smuggle a real diamond into a tambourine. The rest of the bad guys were soon arrested, and the Spiders' face was finally bright by the sunset.

Numbered routes in South Africa

In South Africa some roads are designated as numbered routes to help with navigation. There is a nationwide numbering scheme consisting of national, provincial and regional routes, and within various urban areas there are schemes of metropolitan route numbering.

In the nationwide numbering scheme, routes are divided into a hierarchy of three categories: national routes, which are the most important routes connecting major cities; provincial routes, which connecting smaller cities and towns to the national route network; and regional routes, which connect smaller towns to the route network. Route numbers are allocated to these classes as follows:
These numbers are allocated by the Route Numbering and Road Traffic Signs Sub Committee within the Roads Co-ordinating Body, an organisation which contains representatives from road authorities in national, provincial and local government.

In metropolitan numbering schemes the local authority can designate routes consisting of M followed by any number. The following metropolitan municipalities and their cities have metropolitan numbering schemes.

There are also a number of Ring Roads in South Africa found nationwide

Reuven Fahn

Reuven Fahn ( 18781939 or 1944) was a Polish Jewish writer who was active in the decades before the Holocaust.

Reuven Fahn was born on 21 February 1878 in the village of Starunia in southeastern Austrian Galicia. Fahn could read and write in Hebrew, German, Yiddish, Polish, and Ukrainian by the age of 15. In 1897, at age 19, Fahn married Rachel Keren and moved to his wife's hometown, the Polish city of Halicz. In Halicz, Fahn was influenced by the Karaite Jewish community and their unique culture, which Fahn often wrote about in his literary works.

After Russia conquered eastern Galicia at the start of World War I in 1914, Fahn and many other Galician Jews fled to Vienna, the capital of Austria-Hungary. Fahn enjoyed the libraries in Vienna and worked as a librarian during his time there. He was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army on 1 December 1914. His military service ended on 2 November 1918, with Austria-Hungary's existence ending soon afterwards. Due to his house and property in Halicz being destroyed due to World War I, Fahn moved to Stanisławów (present-day Ivano-Frankivsk). Afterwards, Fahn continued his work, but as a Polish citizen.

During a 1924 trip to Mandatory Palestine, Fahn created a Galician Zionist colony there. Fahn himself thought about moving to Palestine the next year, but decided not to since he feared that Palestine would soon have an economic crisis. The decision by Fahn and many other Galician Zionists to stay in Poland ended up being deadly for them due to the Holocaust destroying most of Poland's Jewish population by 1945. In 1930, Fahn maintained a correspondence with Hayim Nahman Bialik.

Fahn and his first wife had two daughters. His wife died when he was 25 years old. Fahn's eldest daughter Hana was later murdered in the Holocaust while her two daughters survived. In 1905, Fahn remarried to a woman from the city of Bolechow, with whom he had a son and a daughter. Yafa, Fahn's daughter from his second marriage, died at age nine while Fahn and his family were living in Vienna. Yosef, the sickly son from Fahn's second marriage, eventually had a son of his own but he and his entire family were murdered during the Holocaust.

Fahn's exact year and date of death are not known; 1939, 1940, and 1944 were all proposed for this. One report states that he was arrested and killed by the Soviets for Zionist activities a short time before World War II began. Another, possibly more reliable report states that he was murdered by the Nazis and their local Ukrainian allies in Stanisławów at the age of 66 in 1944.

2021 Texas power crisis

In February 2021, the state of Texas had a major power crisis, because of three winter storms in the United States on February 10–11, 13–17, and 15–20. The crisis was caused by a massive electricity generation failure in the state of Texas; and caused shortages of water, food, and heat. 
More than 4.5 million homes and businesses were left without power, some for several days. At least 151 people were killed. The total damage is estimated to be between $100 billion and $200 billion, making it as expensive as Hurricane Harvey and other major disasters.
The Texas crisis's proximate causes were two unanticipated shocks induced from the sub-zero temperatures (‑2˚ F in Dallas): a failure of conventional (thermal) generating supply, mostly from lack of natural gas, and a surge in electricity demand. Inadequate winterization caused freezing of the gas supply and many plants' control instruments. In a system with a winter peak of 66 GW, about 30 GW of thermal plants were unavailable. In its worst-case extreme-winter analysis, ERCOT had expected a loss of 14 GW of thermal resources. The February storm caused more than double the anticipated thermal outages.

Simultaneously, electric heaters created a powerful surge in demand. About 61% of Texans rely on electric heat, mostly low-efficiency resistance heat, in poorly insulated homes — a seemingly sensible choice in a warm climate with cheap electricity, where home heating is often unnecessary. The demand surge caused by the cold came to about 20 GW or one-third of the winter peak. ERCOT based its worst-case analysis on a 2011 winter storm, the most severe cold-weather event in Texas in twenty years. The 2021 storm was much worse than that of 2011. It created an unexpected and unsupportable demand surge.

During the weekend of February 13-14, the temperature dropped more than what ERCOT estimated and as demand for electricity hit a record, the utility had to implement rolling power outages starting early morning Monday, February 15th. Temperatures in Texas averaged 30 degrees Fahrenheit lower than the normal during.

On Tuesday, 16 GW of renewables went down, including generation from wind, and 30 GW was lost from thermal sources including coal, gas and nuclear. By Wednesday 46 GW of total electricity generation was offline with 28 GW of thermal and 18 GW of renewable.

As the demand soared and regional power generators crashed, the frequency of the system also started to drop from the normal 60 Hz to 59.3 Hz. Had the system frequency’s fallen below 59 Hz, the state’s electrical system would have suffered from cascading blackouts which would have lasted for weeks or months and could have caused physical damage to equipment. This would have been much more difficult to recover so to protect the system, load was deliberately shed by the system operator.

RNA-Seq

RNA-Seq (short for "RNA sequencing") is a technique to get snapshots of the continuously changing RNA landscape in a cell.

RNA is a nucleic acid with roles in when, where, and by how much genes are turned on. Classically, sections of DNA are copied to RNA which are decoded into proteins that carry out cellular functions. 

RNAs also have many roles that fall outside this framework. RNA-Seq is typically used to analyze the amount of each gene's RNA in experimental samples. For example, in gene expression and changes made during RNA processing (alternative splicing, editing, mutations, or fusions between RNAs). RNA-Seq requires molecular biology and computational steps. 

Recent advances in RNA-Seq include the ability to study single cells and entire single RNA molecules. It has broad applications in the life sciences from agriculture to medicine.

Leva del Biberón

The "Leva del Biberón" (also known as the "Quinta del Biberón ", baby bottle in Spanish) was the name given to the levies of 1938 and 1939 throughout the territory that republican Spain still controlled during the last years of the Spanish civil war . Mobilized by order of the President of the Second Spanish Republic, Manuel Azaña, at the end of April 1938. At that time, Franco's troops had attacked Lérida, Gandesa, Balaguer, Tremp and Camarasa and were taking control of the last points of republican resistance.

In total, some 30,000 young people were called up, coming from all over the national territory on the Republican side: Murcia, Catalonia, Old Castilla and Valencia, among others. They were under the command of Lluís Companys, among whom would be counted future personalities such as Jesús Blasco. First, they had to cover auxiliary tasks, but on July 25, 1938, they were already participating in the Republican offensive of the Battle of the Ebro, the vast majority being minors, reaching, some as children, only 14 years old.

It is believed that it received this name when Federica Montseny referred to all of them in this way: "“Seventeen years old? but they still are sucking the baby bottle!»".
