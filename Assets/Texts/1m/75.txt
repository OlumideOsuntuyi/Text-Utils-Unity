A special edition was released as well. It included a DVD of four music videos, two each, from Selena and Ana.

2011 Atlantic hurricane season

The 2011 Atlantic hurricane season was one of the most active Atlantic hurricane seasons since 1851. The season started on June 1, 2011 and it ended on November 30, 2011. This season has been "above-average". This means that there has been a lot of tropical cyclones that have developed in the Atlantic basin. The season started when Tropical Storm Arlene formed on June 29. It formed in the Gulf of Mexico. It then made landfall on Veracruz. The storm killed 25 people. The amount of damage was $223 million (2011 USD). After Arlene dissipated, a lot of tropical storms began developing. Most of them developed from a frontal boundary. Which makes this season the first time to have the first eight named storms to have not reached hurricane status.

The record ended when Hurricane Irene formed in late August. Irene also became the first major hurricane (being a category three or higher on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale). After Irene dissipated, Hurricane Katia became the second major hurricane of the season. With seventeen tropical storms, only four became hurricanes. The following hurricane was Hurricane Rina. Between September 7-9, there were three tropical cyclones active, which were Katia, Maria and Nate. This information made the Climate Prediction Center issue a La Niña Advisory.

Tropical Storm Arlene formed off of a tropical wave. It moved across Central America. It brought a lot of rain and caused local flooding. Because of this, three people were killed. On June 27, the disturbance crossed the Yucatán Peninsula and into the Bay of Campeche. The storm began to develop over warm water. It was then given the name Arlene on June 29, around midnight. Arlene made landfall on Cabo Rojo with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph. It then died on July 1. About 22 people were killed while the storm passed through. Arlene cost over 2.6 billion pesos ($207.4 million) of damage.

Tropical Storm Bret formed off of a cold front. This front was near Florida. On July 16, a low-pressure area formed north of the Bahamas. It then began strengthening. The storm became tropical depression number 2 when it was near the Great Abaco Island. Within three hours, the storm was given the name Bret. Bret strengthen while it moved north-east. The storm began to weaken because of wind shear. It then died on July 22 with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph.

Tropical Storm Cindy formed on July 20, when it developed into a tropical depression east of Bermuda. It then died two days later. It did not make landfall.

Tropical Storm Don formed on July 27. It then made landfall as it weakened at Galveston, Texas. The storm did not help the drought the state of was in, dropping no more than of an inch, which was lower than was forecasted.

Tropical Storm Emily formed on August 1. The storm made landfall as a remnant low in Haiti. It then strengthened while it passed through the Bahamas. When the storm left, it began to die.

Tropical Storm Franklin formed on August 12. It did not make landfall. Bermuda was able to get some rain bands from the storm when it moved close by. The storm began to dissipate after it had left Bermuda.

Tropical Storm Gert formed on August 14. It did not make landfall. As Gert neared Bermuda, a small eye-like feature became apparent on radar imagery. Coinciding with this, Gert reached its peak strength with winds of 60 mph (100 km/h).
Passing roughly 90 mi (150 km) east of Bermuda, Gert brought light rain and winds up to 25 mph (40 km/h) to the islands.
By August 16, convection associated with Gert had mostly dissipated and whether or not the system retained a closed surface low was ambiguous. As a result, Gert deteriorated into a post-tropical cyclone over the open Atlantic.

Tropical Storm Harvey formed on August 18. Harvey made landfall in Belize. It was upgraded to Tropical Storm Harvey on August 19. By late August 19 the storm was strengthening rapidly and it was announced that it could become a hurricane just before landfall. However, it only strengthened a little bit. The storm then broke the Atlantic record for having eight tropical storms that did not become a hurricane. Harvey was then downgraded into a depression though it briefly regained tropical storm status in the Bay of Campeche. The storm then dissipated on August 22.

Hurricane Irene formed on August 20. It became a hurricane while it passed through Puerto Rico. Irene then became the first hurricane of the season. Irene became a category 2 hurricane before reaching the Bahamas. It then strengthen into a major hurricane. Irene then became the first major hurricane of the season as well. Irene made landfall on Cape Lookout, North Carolina as a category 1 hurricane with 85 mph winds with an unusually low pressure for a category 1 hurricane. It then moved northeast. After weakening to a tropical storm, Irene made a second U.S. landfall at Brigantine Island in New Jersey at 5:35 a.m. The storm then moved northern and impacted New York City and New England. A total of 56 people were confirmed dead across the Caribbean, 10 U.S. states and Canada in the aftermath and damage from Hurricane Irene totaled $19 billion (2011 USD), making it the fifth costliest hurricane in the Atlantic basin. Irene then dissipated on August 29.

Tropical Depression Ten formed on August 25. It moved off the coast from Africa. It then began to move northeast. The storm dissipated the next day.

Tropical Storm Jose formed on August 27. Jose did not make any landfall.
Yet very early on August 28 and during the next few hours, the tropical wave partially strengthened as conditions for development slightly improved. However, early on August 28 – during the morning hours – the tropical wave nearly dissipated due to the high wind shear once again, this time generated by Hurricane Irene, after the tropical wave passed east to the south of Bermuda. But soon afterwards on August 28, the tropical wave managed to develop into Tropical Storm Jose, just to the west of Bermuda; Jose then began to move north-northeast, slowly. It lasted only 27 hours, as it dissipated on August 29.

The eleventh named storm of the season formed south of the Cape Verde Islands on August 29. The system became a tropical storm on August 30, at which time it was named Katia.
Hurricane Katia formed on August 29. It became the season's second hurricane early on September 1; however, its strength until September 4 when it reached category 2 hurricane strength. On September 5 the system reached Category 3 (major hurricane status). Katia further strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane on September 5. It was downgraded to a category 1 storm by the end of the following day, and remained at that strength even as it became extra-tropical. The storm was of potential concern and was being monitored closely as it may have indirectly impacted the east coast of the United States and Canada. Warnings of severe weather were made for Northern Ireland and Scotland for the remnants of Katia. Its remnants struck the UK and the Republic of Ireland on September 11 and September 12, killing one. Its remnants caused blackouts as far east as Saint Petersburg.

The Unnamed Tropical Storm formed on September 1 east of Boston, Massachusetts as a tropical depression. The storm continued to strengthen and became a tropical storm later that day. It lost all of its tropical characteristics on September 2.
Tropical Storm Lee formed on September 1. It moved into the Gulf of Mexico. It made landfall in Lafayette, Louisiana as a minor tropical storm. It then moved northeastern before it dissipated on September 5.

Hurricane Maria formed on September 6. It moved close to Puerto Rico bringing a lot of rain to the island. Maria became a category 1 hurricane before it made landfall in Newfoundland. Maria then dissipated on September 16.

Hurricane Nate formed on September 7. Nate made landfall near the Mexican coastline. It dissipated on September 12.

Hurricane Ophelia formed on September 20. Ophelia then became a remnant low five days later. On September 27, the storm began to build strength. It then became a category 1 hurricane on September 30. On the same day, it became a category 2 hurricane. The next day, the storm became a category 3 hurricane. On October 1, the storm became a category 4 hurricane. After wards, the storm weakened quickly and lost its tropical features on October 3.

Tropical Storm Philippe formed on September 24. It was a tropical storm for 12 days before becoming a category 1 hurricane on October 6. It weakened again to a tropical storm the next day and was no longer tropical on October 8.

Hurricane Rina formed on October 23 in the Caribbean Sea as a tropical depression. It began to strengthen quickly and became Tropical Storm Rina just hours later. On October 24, Rina reached Category 1 hurricane status. It was still strengthening quickly by October 25, with Rina becoming a category 2 hurricane in the morning hours. It later weakened again to a Category 1 hurricane, then a tropical storm. It continued to weaken, it then became a tropical depression (39 mph or less) on October 28. It became post-tropical (lost its tropical features) later that day.

A large area of cloud that moved off North Carolina became Tropical Storm Sean with winds of 50 mph on November 8. The storm continued to strengthen and peaked at 65 mph. It dissipated on November 12 because of being merged with a cold front.
In the spring of 2012, the WMO (World Meteorological Organization) has retired the name "Irene". The name "Irene" will never be used again in the Atlantic. "Irma" was chosen to replace that name.

Ireland's Call

Ireland's Call is the anthem for the Ireland national rugby union team. The anthem replaced "Amhrán na bhFiann" because the players had came from both Ireland and Northern Ireland.

In most games today, the first part has been sung, then the chorus two times.

Part 1

Come the day and come the hour

Come the power and the glory

We have come to answer our country's call

From the four proud provinces of Ireland

Chorus

Ireland, Ireland

Together standing tall

Shoulder to shoulder

We'll answer Ireland's call

Part 2

From the mighty glens of Antrim

From the rugged hills of Galway

From the walls of Limerick and Dublin Bay

From the four proud provinces of Ireland

Part 3

Hearts of steel and heads unbowing

Vowing never to be broken

We will fight until we can fight no more

For the four proud provinces of Ireland

Part 4

Erin's warriors, clad in emerald

Steadfast souls confront their challenge

'Neath the glass sky they assemble

For the four proud provinces of Ireland

Chinese musical system

The ancient Chinese musical system depends on very ancient mathematics used to determine sound frequencies. The easiest way to explain it is to work through a real example.

Suppose that somebody wanted to make a musical instrument that could play any song in the ancient Chinese system. Here are the instructions:

Make a wooden box 105 cm long and 60 cm wide. Put guides for the strings near each end of the box, and fix it so that these two guides are 99 cm apart. 
Multiply 99 cm by 2/3, which is 66 cm. Place a fret all the way across the box on the 66 cm line.<br>
Multiply 66 cm by 4/3, which is 88 cm. Place a fret along the 88 cm line.<br> 
Multiply 88 cm by 2/3, which is 58.66...6 cm. Place a fret along this line.<br> 
Multiply 58.66...6 cm by 4/3, which is 78.22...2 cm. Place a fret along this line. <br>
Multiply 78.22...2 cm by 2/3, which is 54.148148...148 cm. Place a fret along this line.<br>
Multiply 54.148148...148 cm by 4/3, which is 69.531 cm. Place a fret along this line.<br>
Multiply 69.531 cm by 2/3, which is 46.354 -- and which is too short, so double it to get 92.708 cm. Place a fret along this line.<br>
Multiply 92.708 cm by 4/3...<br>
Multiply the previous answer by 2/3...<br>
Keep going until you have put down eleven frets.

Counting the frequency on the open string and the frequencies on the fretted strings, for each string there will be 12 defined frequencies.

Tune the bottom string to some basic frequency. Tune the next string to the frequency of the bottom string at the first fret. Tune the third string to the bottom string's second fret. Keep going until you have tuned all twelve strings. 

When you pluck these strings at all the fretted and unfretted positions, you will get 144 frequencies. Some of them will be duplicates, but not as many as you might think because this system is not like the Equal tempered system now used for almost all Western music.

Out of each twelve frequencies on a single string, you can make many selections of either five frequencies (for the pentatonic scales) or seven frequencies (for the heptatonic scales).

Here is a chart showing how frequencies and scales can be produced. The frequency of 440 hertz could have been any other frequency. Once this frequency is chosen, it is multiplied by the ratios to produce the first column of frequencies. Each of these 12 frequencies is used to start its own column. (See the dotted red line for one example.) Any five frequencies in a column can be chosen to make a pentatonic scale, as long as they are not right together and are not more than two apart. 

In the United States, students are taught the scale whose notes are named: "do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, and ti." Those seven (known to many from the "Doe, a deer, a female deer" song) produce a major scale. In Western music we also use a minor scale fairly frequently. But we only have those two. Chinese traditional music uses five different scales of five notes each. It also has pentatonic scales, but they are not discussed in this article.

Spinneret

A spinneret is the part of a spider's body that makes its silk. Spiders have one, two, or three pairs of spinnerets. The spinnerets are usually close together. 

Endocardium

The Endocardium is the innermost layer of tissue which lines the inside of the heart. It plays a role in controlling the function of the myocardium, the heart muscle. The endocardium is made of simple epithelial cells similar to those which line blood vessels.

In addition to lining the inside of the heart, the endocardium also regulates heart contractions and aids cardiac embryo development.

Selena singles discography

This is the singles discography page of American singer Selena. This list has her 93 singles, two EPs and eight duets she had made in her music career. Selena was named the "top Latin artist of the '90s" as well as the "Best selling Latin artist of the decade" by "Billboard". Mostly because of her fourteen top-ten singles in the Top Latin Songs chart, including seven number-one hits. To date, Selena has sold over 5,000,000 singles worldwide.

"Contigo Quiero Estar" () was the lead single from "Selena" (1989). The song peaked at number eight on the US Hot Latin Tracks. "Baila Esta Cumbia" () was the lead single from "Ven Conmigo" (1990). The song peaked at number 20 on the Hot Latin Tracks. The song "Buenos Amigos" () was a duet with Salvadoran singer Alvaro Torres. The song peaked at number-one on the Hot Latin Tracks. It became Selena's and Torres' first number-one single. The song was a non-album single for Selena because it was not included in any of Selena's albums when she was alive. "La Carcacha" () became the lead single off of "Entre A Mi Mundo" (1992). The song peaked at number seven on the Latin Regional Mexican Airplay chart. "Como La Flor" () became one of Selena's signature songs. The song peaked at number-one on the Hot Latin Tracks. It became Selena's first song to peak at number-one as a solo artist. "¿Qué Creias?" () became the third single released from "Entre A Mi Mundo". The song peaked at number 14 on the Hot Latin Tracks. "Como La Flor", "La Carcacha" and "¿Qué Creias?" helped Selena to be accepted into Mexico. She began touring there for the first time and broke several audience attendance records. After Selena had won her first Grammy Award for "Selena Live!" (1993), the album released three singles. "No Debes Jugar" (), "La Llamada" () and "Tu Robaste Mi Corazon" () peaked within the top five of the Hot Latin Tracks chart.

When "Amor Prohibido" (1994) was released, it had four number-one singles. Selena became the first Hispanic singer to do this. The four number-one singles were "Amor Prohibido" (), "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom", "No Me Queda Mas" () and "Fotos y Recuerdos" (). These songs helped expanded Selena's fan base. The non-album single "Donde Quiera Que Estes" () peaked at number-one on both the Hot Latin Tracks and Latin Regional Mexican Airplay charts. The song was a duet with the Barrio Boyzz. The song made Selena to tour in New York City, Puerto Rico, South America and Central America where she was not known before. The songs "Amor Prohibido" and "No Me Queda Mas" became the most successful singles of 1994 and 1995 in the United States Hispanic communities and Mexico.

Selena began recording songs for her crossover album. She only recorded six by January 20, 1995. She was killed on March 31, 1995. The album was released on July 18, 1995 as "Dreaming of You". "I Could Fall in Love" peaked at number-one on the Hot Latin Tracks while also peaking in eight different countries worldwide. "Dreaming of You" peaked at number-one in five different music charts worldwide. The song peaked in 13 different countries worldwide. It sold 4,798,706 copies worldwide, while selling 2,000,000 copies in the United States. The song was certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The song was given 11 certifications worldwide. It is among the best-selling singles worldwide. It is the second-fastest-selling single of 1995 in the United States. The song was the 83rd best-selling single of the 1990s in the United Kingdom. It also became the 65th best-selling single of the 1990s in France. "Dreaming of You" and "I Could Fall in Love" continues to be played on radio stations in the United States. The most recent peak positions for the songs was in 2010. The Barrio Boyzz recorded their duet with Selena in English for the crossover album. The English version stood on Spain's music chart for two years straight. After Selena's murder, eighteen singles were released. Many of those peaked in music charts in the United States, Spanish-speaking countries, France and Canada.



Beelzebufo

Beelzebufo was a large frog discovered in the Upper Cretaceous of Madagascar. The media called it 'Devil Toad', and 'The Frog From Hell'. The frog lived some 70 million years ago.

With a body length of about 16 inches (40.5 cm) the frog was larger than any living frog. Its weight in life was about 9-10 lbs (4.5 kg).

The bones of the skull roof shows a rugous (wrinkled) external surface, indicating that at least parts of the head may have borne bony scutes.

The "Beelzebufo" was a member of the horned toad sub-family, the Ceratophryinae. Living members of the family are found only in South America, but were once more widely distributed in Gondwana. Both South America and Madagascar were part of the supercontinent Gondwana before it broke up in the Cretaceous.

"Beelzebufo" was an ambush predator whose wide mouth let it eat relatively large prey, perhaps even juvenile dinosaurs. It probably lived in warm, seasonally dry habitats with occasional pools of water. Its modern relatives live in similar habitats, and can burrow.

Fezouata Formation

The Upper and Lower Fezouata formations of Morocco are Burgess Shale type deposits dating to the Lower Ordovician. In the fossilized fauna were numerous organisms previously thought to have died out after the mid-Cambrian. The discovery proves conclusively that the Burgess Shale biota did not go extinct in the Cambrian.

Over 1500 non-mineralized Burgess Shale types, representing 50 taxa, have been recovered from the formations. There are also a less abundant shelly fauna. The make-up of the community varies significantly through the stratigraphic sequence, with both abundances and faunal composition changing as time progresses. Small (1–3 mm wide) burrows are present in the sediment, but major burrowing is absent; this may suggest a paucity of oxygen in the water or sediment. 

Particularly notable is the presence of bryozoa and graptolites, forms that are absent in the Cambrian period. Various echinoderms indicate a normal range of salinity, and the overall shelly assemblage is not significantly different from the normal shelly fauna expected in open Ordovician waters. 

The non-mineralized (soft-bodied) fossils contains a range of forms familiar from the Burgess Shale. Other Ordovician oddballs are also present, including cheloniellids and horseshoe crabs in abundance.

The fossiliferous strata were deposited in quiet, deep waters, below the influence of wave action in all but the fiercest of storms. Such storms, or similar high-energy events, would have mobilized sediment that could be quickly deposited, trapping animals and leading to their preservation. Consequently, the assemblage is dominated by benthic organisms.

Fossils of the Fezouata formation, which are usually squashed flat (although some do retain some degree of their original three-dimensionality) are often coated with a dusting of pyrite, and tin; this aspect of the fossil preservation is very similar to that at Chengjiang. Non-mineralized appendages are often preserved.

The fossils a span an area of 500 km, in southeast Morocco's Draa Valley, north of Zagora. Fossils are found are found through a 1.1 km-thick column of rock that spans the two lowest epochs of the Ordovician.

The lagerstätten were first identified in the late 1990s when a local fossil collector, Ben Moula, showed some of the finds to a PhD student who was then working in the area.

1961 World Ice Hockey Championships

The 1961 World Ice Hockey Championships was the 28th time the Ice Hockey World Championships were held. The tournament was in Geneva and Lausanne, Switzerland from March 1 to March 12, 1961. Canada won their nineteenth international title. It would be the last championship for Canada in thirty-three years. Canada was represented by the Trail Smoke Eaters.


1961 Stanley Cup Finals

The 1961 Stanley Cup Final was played by the Detroit Red Wings and the Chicago Blackhawks. Chicago had not been in the Final since , and Detroit had last played in the Final in . The Blackhawks won the best-of-seven series four games to two, winning their third Stanley Cup. This ended up being the last time Chicago won the Cup until , a 49-year drought.


Wolf spider

A Wolf spider is a member of the group of spiders whose is the "Lycosidae." "Lycos" means "wolf" in . These spiders get their name from the way they hunt, which the people who named them thought was like the way wolves hunt. However, wolves hunt in but spiders are animals. Their way of hunting is more like that of solitary cats such as the cheetahs. They generally wait for their to close by, and then they in to kill it.

The wolf spiders belong to a large group. The smallest are less than 0.04 inches (1 mm) in body length. The largest are around 1.5 inches (38 mm) in body length. Some wolf spiders spend all of their lives above ground (taking the best shelter they can find), others dig burrows but come out of the burrows to wander about and hunt, and some spend almost all of their lives waiting for passing insects in their burrows.

One species of wolf spider gives us the name that is now used in English for an entirely different kind of spider. This is "Hogna tarantula" because it found around Taranto, a city in Italy. People there once believed that if a human were bitten by one of these wolf spiders, they would surely die unless made to do a wild dance. Actually, "Hogna tarantula" does not give bites that need medical help. Any deaths from spiders in the area of Taranto probably came from the local Widow spider.

After a female wolf spider mates, she creates a clear space on the ground, lays down a rough sheet of silk, and on top of that sheet she makes a silken cup in which she lays her eggs. She next closes the cup, making a round ball, and holds onto it using her spinnerets until the babies begin to hatch. She then opens the silk ball and lets the baby spiders come out. They all run up her legs and cover the top part of her body.. There may be more than one hundred baby spiders on her back.

As you can see from the second photograph, mother wolf spiders carry their baby spiders around on their backs. They protect the babies for a few days, and then the babies leave her and go off on their own. 

There are several kinds of spiders that look almost like wolf spiders. The best way to be sure is to look at the eyes. There are four small eyes at the bottom, then two very large eyes, then two somewhat smaller eyes.

Wolf spiders come in various sizes, ranging from 2 millimeter to 40 millimeter in size (more than an inch in body size).

Web feed

A web feed is an XML-based document which contains a sequence of content items. Web logs or blogs are a common source for web feeds. However, web feeds may also be associated with different sources other than blogs.

The term syndication is used to describe the availability of a web feed for an information source, such as a blog. This is also known as "publishing" a feed.

The term aggregation is used to describe the process of combining the contents of multiple web feeds, such as for display on a single web page. This is also known as "subscribing" to a web feed.

Web feeds are designed to be machine readable, so there is no requirement that they be destined only for user consumption. For example, business partners could use web feeds to exchange information without any user intervention.

Web feeds are commonly in RSS or Atom "feed" format. They may also be in RDF format.


Sagrera railway station

Estació de la Sagrera () is an upcoming major transport railway. It will be in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The railway is currently under construction. They believe it will be finished by 2016-2020. The train will be at Barcelona Metro station that will serve the north of the city. It will include services from AVE high-speed rail. The Spanish Ministry of Public Works, Generalitat de Catalunya and the Barcelona City Council gave money to have the train completed. The complex will be fully underground excepting for the station building, with two levels of platforms, accounting for a total of 18 railway tracks.

Eric Serra

Eric Serra (born September 9, 1959) is a French composer, often working with Luc Besson on his movie scores. He has won many awards for his works.

Éric Serra's father Claude was a famous French songwriter in the 1950s and '60s. Because Claude worked on his music around his son Eric; he became aware of music when he was very young. Eric's mother had died when he was only seven years old. In the early 1980s, Serra had met Luc Besson. Besson was a movie director. Besson had asked Serra to write a score his first movie "Le Dernier Combat" (1983). Serra then began creating scores to most of Besson's movies.

In 1995, Serra was chosen to write the score to GoldenEye. The 17th James Bond movie was directed by Martin Campbell. The score had mixed feedback from film critics.



Education in the United States

Education in the United States is provided by the public sector. The federal, state and local governments control and give funds to help local schools. Public education is available everywhere in the United States. School's curriculum, funds, teaching, employment and other policies are created by the elected school boards. There are also private schools, which cost money to attend.

School districts are sometimes different from other local jurisdictions. They have their own officials and budgets. Education standards and state tests are created by the state governments. Since child education is required by law, ages to start school are different from each state. Children usually start school between the ages of five to six. They usually end their education when they are between the ages of seventeen and eighteen. Education requirements can be done by educating children in public schools, private schools (who is known by the government to be trusted) or a home school program. In most public schools, education is divided into three levels. The first level is elementary school. Grades in elementary school are different in each state. The second level is middle school. Grades in middle school are different in each state as well. The last level is high school. In some states, middle school is called "junior high school". Grades in high school are also different in each state. After a child has completed their senior year (12th grade), they will earn a high school diploma.

If a child would like to continue on with their education or want to start a career, they can apply for college. After four years at a university or college, they will earn a bachelor's degree in one subject. Students can also choose to attend a two-year community college. Some two-year community colleges are called "Junior colleges". Colleges are not required and are not forced by local laws. Students must pay to attend college, but the price is lowered if they get a scholarship. After college, the now adult can earn a number of certificates for a career. Graduate school is another option after college. A student can earn a master's degree or Ph.D. in any subject. They may go to medical school to earn an M.D. and become a physician, law school to earn a J.D. and become a lawyer, or business school to earn an MBA.

Rafael Correa

Rafael Vicente Correa Delgado born April 6, 1963 in Guayaquil, was the 43rd President of Ecuador, and in 2009-2010 was the president "pro tempore" of the UNASUR.

Correa was elected President of Ecuador in late 2006 and took office in January 2007. In December 2008, he declared Ecuador's national debt illegitimate, based on the argument that it had been contracted by despotic prior regimes.

Correa's first term in office had been due to end on January 15, 2011, but the new approved constitution, written by the new National Assembly, called for general elections for April 26, 2009. In that election, Rafael Correa won in the first round with 51.9% of votes counted.

Rafael Correa was raised in a working class family from Guayaquil, the country's largest city. His father was Rafael Correa Icaza, born in the Province of Los Ríos, Ecuador, 23 March 1934, and deceased 10 June 1995. His mother is Norma Delgado Rendón, born 1 September 1939. His parents had three more children: Fabricio Correa, Pierina Correa and Bernardita Correa.

He attended primary and secondary school in San José-La Salle School in Guayaquil. During his youth he was a boy scout. Correa met his future Vice President, Jorge Glas while they were scouts as youth.

During his secondary studies he was president of the Lasallian Student Cultural Association ("ACEL" in Spanish). Afterwards and based on his academic achievements, he was given a scholarship to study at the Catholic University of Santiago de Guayaquil (UCSG in Spanish), a private higher education institution in Guayaquil, Ecuador, where he obtained an undergraduate degree in economics in 1987.

Elissa

Elissar Zakaria Khoury () was born on October 27, 1972 in Deir el Ahmar, Lebanon. She is known simply as "Elissa". She is a Lebanese singer. 

Elissa was born on October 27, 1972 to a Lebanese father Zakaria Khoury and a Syrian mother Youmna Suud. In 1992, she competed in "Studio El Fan" and won a silver medal. She released her debut album "Baddi Doub" in 1999 with EMI. In 2006, Elissa released "Bastanak", her fifth studio album. "Bastanak" () became her most successful album. It peaked at number-one in eight Arab music charts. The album won the World Music Award for "Best Arabic Artist". She has done a lot of duets with famous Arab and international singers as well. She has done duets with Ragheb Alama, Cheb Mami, Fadl Shaker, Chris DeBurgh and Gypsy Kings.


Bastanak

Bastanak (; in ) is the fifth studio album by Lebanese singer Elissa. The album won the World Music Award in 2007. Elissa was awarded "Best Lebanese Artist of the Year". The album peaked at number-one in eight Arab music charts.

The lead single from the album was also called "Bastanak". The song became one of Elissa's signature songs, and helped Elissa to perform at more venues across the world. The song "Bastanak" peaked at number-one in several Arab music charts.

A conflict between Elissa and another female Arab singer began to get media attention. The other Arab singer accused Elissa of stealing the lyrics of the song from a composer that left the lyrics by mistake at her house. The composer was Elissa's friend who had helped her with writing songs for her albums. Elissa then stated that she was wrong and said that she indeed wrote the entire song by herself.

"Bastanak" is performed on E minor with 100 beats per minute. The song has folk fusion, roots reggae, R&B and Arabic pop music genres. The song talks about a lonely sad girl wishing to be with her boyfriend. In the song she states that each guy she has been has not been the same. She also states that she will wait for days, months and even years to be with him once again.

A music video, which was directed by Brandon Dickerson, was released in the summer of 2007. The music video starts off with Elissa in a restaurant enjoying her day with her friends. The video then turns to the next scene with Elissa in a angel outfit. The concept of the song was also in the music video. Elissa goes about her day feeling sad while guys hit on her.

Pepsi also released a commercial with Elissa singing the song. The commercial also had American singer Christina Aguilera singing a song from her album "Back to Basics" (2006). The video has Elissa singing the hook of the song to a guy during a snow storm and to two young Chinese girls in China.


Order of the Solar Temple

The Order of the Solar Temple (or Ordre du Temple Solaire, International Chivalric Organization of the Solar Tradition) was a secret society that existed in the second half of the 20th century and that was based on the belief that the Knights Templar still existed. OTS was started by Joseph Di Mambro and Luc Jouret in 1984 in Geneva as "l'Ordre International Chevaleresque de Tradition Solaire" (OICTS) and renamed "Ordre du Temple Solaire". OTS is considered to be a sect. The organisation was involved in mass suicides in France, Switzerland and Canada. The beliefs of the society were a mix of protestant Christianity and New Age philosophy; it also used and changed different Freemason rituals. 

Epistemic community

Epistemic community is a large network of people who work towards a common knowledge-based goal—like the community of people who work together to create and maintain Wikipedia.

An epistemic community is a group of people who do not have any specific history together. They join to form a kind of community based on a similar focus on an information-based project. 

The community group can be made of people with a range of special interests.

This kind of community has four characteristics or typical features:

The shared explanations for how the community functions includes "the appalling silence of good people", which encourages the growth of perverse incentives.

An example of a scientific epistemic community is the 1975 Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP). This is a marine pollution control regime for the Mediterranean Sea developed by the United Nations.




Biosemiotics

Biosemiotics is a science where the models of sign processes are used to study living systems. Unlike biophysics, biochemistry and molecular biology, sciences where the quantitative physical laws are used to explain the living things, biosemioticians study the organisms and phenomena of life on the basis of qualitative semiotic principles.


University of Tartu

University of Tartu is the main university in Estonia. It is in Tartu. It is the second oldest university in Northern Europe. It was established in 1632. The first pharmacology department in the world was set up here by Rudolf Buchheim in 1847. 

The university is particularly famous due to its semiotics school established by Juri Lotman.

Marcel Dionne

Marcel Elphege "Little Beaver" Dionne (born August 3, 1951) is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey centre. He played 18 seasons in the National Hockey League for the Detroit Red Wings, Los Angeles Kings and New York Rangers. Dionne entered the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1992.

Infant mortality

Infant mortality is a measure of how many babies die during the first 12 months after birth. It is usually measured as being a number of deaths for every thousand births. The rate of infant mortality in a given place is the total number of babies dying under one year of age divided by the total number of live births during the year, then all multiplied by 1,000. For example, in 2009 the infant mortality rate in the USA was 6.8. That means for every 1000 births, 6.8 babies will die before the age of one.


What a Girl Wants

"What a Girl Wants" is a 1999 pop song by American singer Christina Aguilera, from her first album "Christina Aguilera". It peaked at number one on the "Billboard" Hot 100. The song was nominated for "Best Female Pop Vocal Performance" at the 43rd Grammy Awards but lost to Macy Gray's "I Try".

Bryan Trottier

Bryan John Trottier (born July 17, 1956) is a Canadian-American retired professional ice hockey centre who played 18 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New York Islanders and Pittsburgh Penguins. He won four Stanley Cups with the Islanders, two with the Penguins and one as an assistant coach with the Colorado Avalanche.

On August 4, 2014, Trottier was hired to be an assistant coach of the Buffalo Sabres.


Woohoo

"Woohoo" is a song sung by Christina Aguilera and Nicki Minaj, from Aguilera's 2010 album "Bionic". The song was written by Aguilera, Minaj, Claude Kelly, Jamal "Polow da Don" Jones and Ester Dean. It is a uptempo electrohop song with R&B and hip hop influences; lyrically it speaks of cunnilingus. The song was released on May 18, 2010 as the second single from Aguilera's "Bionic" album.

Australian gold rushes

The Australian gold rush was a large number of gold discoveries in Australia. Thousands of people came to Australia in the hope of finding a lot of gold and becoming rich. The rush started in 1851 when gold was found near Bathurst, New South Wales and ended with the last rush in 1893 to Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. At each place gold was easily found in rivers and creeks. This was known as alluvial gold and could be found by individual miners using very basic equipment such as a spade and a dish. In most places this alluvial gold was taken in the first few months. To get at the gold that was buried deeper in the ground meant that the miners needed to work together to dig tunnels. Eventually large companies were formed to raise money so that deep gold mines could be built.

The gold rushes happened when alluvial gold was found. Miners would quickly move there in the hope of being the first to find the surface gold. For example, miners rushing to Clunes, Victoria in August 1851, quickly changed their minds and went to Buninyong when they heard of a new gold discovery. Weeks later gold was found at Ballarat a few miles to the north and within six weeks there were more than 10,000 people digging. But by 1852 most miners had left Ballarat and rushed to the new goldfields at Bendigo. In 1854, miners in Ballarat were angry and upset at paying for gold licences. They burned their licences and raised the Eureka Stockade flag in protest. The miners fought soldiers and police officers to protect their rights. This was called the Eureka Stockade. Many people died, but afterwards the miners didn't have to pay for their licences anymore.

The gold rush finished at the end of the 1850s, but gold was still found throughout Australia up until the 1890s.

Gold had been found in Australia before the 1851 gold rush. At first people would not believe the stories. A convict who found gold near Bathurst in 1823 was given 150 lashes with a whip as it was believed he must have stolen it. The explorer Count Paul Strzelecki found gold in the Australian Alps in 1839. The government kept it a secret as they did not want to lose control of the convicts if they went rushing off to search for gold. Gold was also found at:

The first gold rush was in New South Wales. There were many others during the next 30 years.






Romney Marsh

Romney Marsh is a coastal marshland of southern England. It runs from Hythe in Kent to Rye in East Sussex. It covers about 100 miles (260 km). Romney Marsh is one of three English wetlands, the others being The Fens of East Anglia and the Somerset Levels.

Much of the area has been reclaimed over the centuries, and is now flat farmland. Before the area was drained, it was a cause of malaria among the inhabitants. For much of its history, the Marsh was fringed by a lagoon, which was protected by a shingle beach at Dymchurch.

The Marsh still contains some water features, particularly the Royal Military Canal, completed in 1809, and the River Rother.

At Romney Marsh the coast is at its closest to France, and was several times the point of invasion. In AD 892, a Danish fleet of 250 ships sailed right into the River Rother and took the fortress at Appledore (allegedly built by King Arthur), which they destroyed.

The Romans used the Romney area for a salt industry. Pans of brackish water were left to evaporate, and the salt collected for use in food.

The marsh includes two of the ancient Cinque Ports, New Romney and Hythe, and two ancient towns, Rye and Winchelsea. New Romney was once a port, but is now a mile and a half from the sea. It is the main centre of population on the Marsh.

Padua Airport

Padua Airport or Gino Allegri () , in Padua, Italy, is the principal airport serving Padua.

Toxaphene

Toxaphene is a chemical substance that is very toxic. It is a persistent organic pollutant, and one of the twelve substances listed in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Its use is banned since 1993. It was used as an insecticide. It was mainly the cotton and soybean growers who used it. It was also used to treat Mange in cattle. The substance damages the lungs, the nervous system and the kidneys. It is a carcinogen and causes mutations and birth defects. Because it is very volatile, it travels easily through the environment. 

Eduard Strauss

Eduard Strauss (b. Vienna, 15 March 1835, d. Vienna, 28 December 1916) was a Viennese composer of light music. He was also a conductor. He was the brother of the more famous composers Johann Strauss II and Josef Strauss, the son of Johann Strauss I, and the father of Johann Strauss III.


Jug (container)

A jug is a type of container that holds liquid (e.g. water). It has an opening that is often small. This is where the liquid is poured from. Jugs nearly always have a handle.


Paul Goldschmidt

Paul Edward Goldschmidt (born September 10, 1987 in Wilmington, Delaware) is an American baseball player. He currently plays as a first baseman for the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball (MLB). He debuted for the Diamondbacks on August 1, 2011 in a game against the San Francisco Giants.


Dendritic cell

Dendritic cells (DCs) are white blood cells forming part of the mammalian immune system. They process antigen material from pathogens and put it on their surface. There it touches other cells of the immune system. So, dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells. They act as messengers between the innate and adaptive immune systems.

Dendritic cells are present in tissues in contact with the external environment. These tissues are the skin, and the inner lining of the nose, lungs, stomach and intestines. They can also be found in an immature and mature state in the blood.

Dedritic cells develop from monocytes, white blood cells which circulate in the body. Depending on the signal, monocytes turn into either dendritic cells or macrophages. The monocytes are formed from stem cells in the bone marrow.

Immature dendritic cells constantly sample their surrounds for pathogens such as viruses and bacteria. This is done through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as the toll-like receptors (TLRs). 

They eat pathogens and break down their proteins into small pieces and put these fragments on their cell surface using MHC molecules. Once activated, these cells move to the lymph nodes and become mature. They switch on cell-surface receptors which activate T cells and B cells to start and shape the adaptive immune response.

Dendritic cells were first described by Paul Langerhans (Langerhans cells) in the late nineteenth century. It wasn't until 1973, however, that Ralph Steinman and Zanvil Cohn gave them the name 'dendritic cells'. For discovering the central role of dendritic cells in the adaptive immune response, Steinman was awarded the Albert Lasker Award in 2007, and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2011.

Ralph Steinman

Ralph Marvin Steinman (January 14, 1943 – September 30, 2011) was a Canadian immunologist and cell biologist at Rockefeller University. He studied a kind of cell in the immune system and called them "dendritic cells". He made these discoveries while working in the laboratory of Zanvil A. Cohn. He was of Jewish descent.

On October 3, 2011, the Nobel Committee announced that Steinman had received one-half of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, for "his discovery of the dendritic cell and its role in adaptive immunity". The other half went to Bruce Beutler and Jules Hoffmann, for "their discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity". However, the committee did not know that Steinman had died three days earlier, on September 30, from pancreatic cancer. The committee considered what to do about Steinman's prize, since the rule is that the prize is not awarded posthumously.

The committee later decided that, as the decision to award the prize "was made in good faith", they would not change the award.

Steinman's daughter said that he had joked the previous week with his family about hanging on until the prize announcement. Steinman said: "I know I have got to hold out for that. They don't give it to you if you have passed away. I got to hold out for that".

Steinman had received numerous other awards and recognitions for his life-long work on dendritic cells, such as the Albert Lasker Award (2007), the Gairdner Foundation International Award (2003), and the Cancer Research Institute William B. Coley Award (1998). In addition, he was made a member of Institute of Medicine (U.S.A.; elected 2002) and the National Academy of Sciences (U.S.A.; elected 2001).

Residual-current device

A ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI), or Residual Current Device (RCD) is a type of circuit breaker. This type shuts off electric power (or breaks the electrical circuit), to protect people from an electric shock caused when some of the current travels through a person's body due to an electrical fault such as a short circuit, insulation failure, or equipment that is not working right. 

Standard circuit breakers shut off power when the current is too high, like 10, 15, or 20 amps. This protects machinery, and is often good enough to prevent hurting people.

The GFCI / RCD breaks the circuit when it detects an imbalance of only 0.005 amps (0.030 amps in Australia and some European and Asian countries). Even this small amount of current, 0.030 amps, going through one human body might possibly kill, by causing paralysis of skeletal muscles and stopping the heart. 

A standard circuit breaker protects the house electrical wires, receptacles and switches, and appliances and fixtures from dangerous conditions, which could contribute to overheating and possible fire. A GFCI / RCD protects people from shock and electrocution and is often found in bathrooms or kitchens where electrical devices may be used near water. While using electrical devices in these locations, someone's bare skin may be in contact with water or a wet floor or metal fixtures. Any of these can provide an alternate path for current to travel in the case of an electrical fault. 

A GFCI / RCD can also prevent dangers from short circuits and other electrical faults that don't involve humans such as a low current short where the current never reaches the trigger point for a circuit breaker, e.g. a live wire falls in a tub of water or moist soil and only 1 or 2 amps of current flow.
GFCIs are available in two types: the circuit breaker that installs in an electrical panel, and the receptacle type that installs into an electrical box.

GFCIs are a suitable replacement for two prong outlets without a grounded wire. The National Electric Code requires GFCI protection in dwelling on kitchen counter tops, bathrooms, unfinished basements not intended as habitable rooms, crawl spaces, garages, sinks where the receptacles are installed within 6 feet from the top edge of the bowl of the sink, boathouses, bathtubs or shower stalls where receptacles are installed within 6 feet from the edge of the bathtub or shower, laundry areas, outdoors except for receptacles that are not readily accessible and are supplied by a branch circuit dedicated to electric snow-melting. De-icing, or pipeline and vessel heating equipment shall be installed in accordance with NEC 426.28 or 427.22 as applicable. 

GFCI protection is required on construction sites.

Calico cat

Calico cat is an American name for cats with three colors. Outside of North America they are usually called tortoiseshell cats or 'tortie-and-white'. A calico cat has a coat of orange or brown and black spots on a white background. It is not a breed of cat.

Nearly all calico cats are female. There are male calico cats, but they are very rare. Only one of every 3000 calico cats are male.

A single X chromosome can have either a black allele of the coloration gene or an orange version, but not both. However, a female cat has two X chromosomes, so it can have both versions, black on one chromosome and orange on the other, making the cat a calico. A male cat usually has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. A Y chromosome does not have a color gene, so the cat can have either an orange or a black gene, but not both. Calico cats are often used as an example in biology classes when discussing sex chromosomes.

During the early stages of development, when the cat is still an embryo, in each cell one of the X chromosomes (either the black one or the orange one) deactivates. It is called X-inactivation. All cells that were copied from a cell with a deactivated X chromosome will also have the same X chromosome deactivated. This is what leads to formation of the spots. The earlier in development the X chromosomes deactivate, the larger the spots will be. Deactivation of one of the X chromosomes happens in all female mammals. The white coloring on a calico is from a separate gene unrelated to the orange or black genes. Whether or not a cat is a calico is determined by genetics, but the actual layout of the spots is not. The layout of the spots is almost random. It is not possible to selectively breed or clone calico cats: an attempt to clone a calico cat will produce a black and white cat or orange and white tabby cat. The tortoiseshell cat is similar, although on a tortoiseshell cat the spots are usually smaller and closer together and there is less or no white.
It is possible for a male cat to be a calico if it has Klinefelter's syndrome, where it has two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome, though not all cats with Klinefelter's syndrome are calico.

In Japan, calico cats are said to bring good luck. In many Japanese shops there is a calico Japanese Bobtail figurine called the Maneki Neko, which is said to bring good luck to the shop's owner.

Calico cats were, and still are, popular choices for a ship's cat. They are said to bring good luck to the ship's crew.




Bruce Beutler

Bruce Alan Beutler M.D. (born December 29, 1957 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American immunologist and geneticist of Jewish descent. Together with Jules Hoffmann, he received one-half of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, for "discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity" (the other half went to Ralph Steinman for "his discovery of the dendritic cell and its role in adaptive immunity").

Beutler is currently Director of the Center for the Genetics of Host Defense at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas and Professor and Chairman of the Department of Genetics at The Scripps Research Institute, in La Jolla, California. His father, Ernest Beutler, a hematologist and medical geneticist, was also a Professor and Department Chairman at Scripps.

Beutler is best known for his pioneering molecular and genetic studies of inflammation and innate immunity. Interested in the mechanism by which lipopolysacchride (LPS) activates mammalian immune cells, Beutler identified the LPS receptor. Identification of the receptor hinged on the positional cloning (a method of gene identification) of the mammalian "Lps" locus, which had been known since the 1960s as a key gene for biological responses to LPS.

Beutler thus discovered the key sensors of microbial infection in mammals. He found that one of the mammalian toll-like receptors, TLR4, acts as the membrane-spanning component of the mammalian LPS receptor complex. The TLRs work in the perception of microbes. Ten are now known in humans. Each detects signature molecules produced early in an infection. These receptors also work in severe illness, including shock and systemic inflammation as it occurs in the course of an infection. They are also active in sterile inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. The research on TLRs won him the Nobel Prize in 2011.

The positional cloning of "Lps" was completed in 1998. Beutler continued to analyse immunity in mammals. His work found numerous signalling molecules of the innate immune response, and helped to work out the biochemistry of innate immunity.

Jules Hoffmann

Jules A. Hoffmann (born 2 August 1941) is a Luxembourg-born French biologist. He is a research director and member of the board of administrators of the National Center of Scientific Research (CNRS) in Strasbourg, France. In 2007, he became President of the French Academy of Sciences. 

Together with Bruce Beutler, Hoffmann received one-half of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for "their discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity". Hoffmann discovered the function of the fruit fly "Toll" gene in innate immunity. Its mammalian homologues, the toll-like receptors, were discovered by Beutler. Toll-like receptors identify constituents of other organisms like fungi and bacteria, and trigger an immune response. This explains how septic shock can be triggered by bacterial remains.

Hoffmann completed his PhD in biology at the University of Strasbourg in 1969. His post-doctoral training was at the Institut für Physiologische Chemie at Philipps-Universität in Marburg an der Lahn, Germany in 1973–1974.

Hoffmann was a research assistant at CNRS from 1964 to 1968, and became a research associate in 1969. Since 1974 he has been a Research Director of CNRS. Between 1978 and 2005 he was Director of the CNRS research unit "Immune Response and Development in Insects", and from 1993 to 2005 he was director of the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology of CNRS in Strasbourg.

Hoffmann is a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, the French National Academy of Sciences, the Academia Europaea, the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Autoimmune disease

Autoimmune disease is when the body's immune system attacks its own body. The function of the immune system is to recognise and reject foreign bodies like bacteria. Sometimes the system goes wrong, and the body itself gets damaged by its immune system. Examples are:


Factoid

Factoid is stating a fact that is not backed up by evidence. The factoid may not be trusted because
Factoids become widely treated as if they were true. 

In 1973, the term "factoid" was created and first used by Norman Mailer. 

A factoid is "an item of unreliable information which is repeated so often that it becomes accepted as a fact". The most important thing is that the factoid is widely believed. A factoid refers to something that looks like a fact, could be a fact, but in fact is not a fact.

The term can also be used to describe partial information without context.

Allotropes of carbon

There are several allotropes of carbon. Diamond and graphite are the most famous. Graphite is a conductor, a semimetal (an element that is partially a metal and a nonmetal, such as black phosphorus and grey selenium). It can be used, for instance, as the material in the electrodes of an electrical arc lamp. Graphite is the most stable form of solid carbon ever discovered.

Allotropes are different forms of the same chemical element. All elements are made up uniquely of their own atoms. Any physical differences are because of how the atoms are joined together. Many elements show allotropy because there are a number of ways in which the atoms can be linked together. Also there are different ways in how the molecules can be arranged to make larger structures.

Diamond is one of the best known allotropes of carbon. Its hardness and high dispersion of light make it good for use in jewellery. It also has industrial uses. Diamond is the hardest known natural mineral. This makes it an excellent abrasive. A diamond also holds its luster well. Both diamond and graphite have extremely high melting point, which is unusual for nonmetallic element.

SpySheriff

SpySheriff, also known as Brave Sentry, SpyAxe, SpywareSheriff, Pest Trap, SpyTrooper, Spywareno, and MalwareAlarm, is malware that pretends to be real anti-spyware program. SpySheriff tries to trick the user into buying the program by making false warnings and alerts. It is very difficult to remove SpySheriff from computers, since it hides its parts in "System Restore" folders. SpySheriff also blocks some parts of the computer's administrative tools. Like other rogue antivirus programs, SpySheriff asks the user to register when they click "Remove found threats". SpySheriff can be removed by real antivirus programs.

Lunokhod 1

Lunokhod 1 was a lunar rover made by the Soviet Union. It was part of the Lunokhod programme. It was the first man made rover (vehicle) to land on another planet. It landed on the Moon on November 17, 1970. It drove around on the Moon for nearly a year, collecting information about the soil and landscape. The Lunokhod had only two speeds, 1 km/h or 2 km/h. It had four TV cameras and was controlled by a five person team on Earth.

It was lost for almost 40 years, but the space rocket which delivered the rover to the Moon was found in photos taken by the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Scientists were then able to follow the rover's tracks and found the rover about 10 km away. They can now send laser beams to a reflector on the rover which will send them back to Earth. This will help them with measurements to find the exact centre of the Moon.

Salmonella enterica

Salmonella enterica is a rod-shaped bacterium. It is a member of the genus "Salmonella".

It causes typhoid fever. The symptoms of typhoid fever include nausea, vomiting, and fever. The main source of infection is from swallowing infected water. Food may also be able to pick up the bacterium if it is washed or grown with contaminated water.

Medusa (biology)

In biology, a medusa (plural: medusae) is a form of cnidarian in which the body is shaped like an umbrella. The other main body-form is the polyp. 

Medusae vary from bell-shaped to the shape of a thin disk, scarcely convex above and only slightly concave below. The upper or aboral surface is called the "exumbrella" and the lower surface is called the "subumbrella"; the mouth is on the lower surface, which may be partially closed by a membrane extending inward from the margin (called the "velum"). The digestive cavity consists of the gastrovascular cavity and radiating canals which extend toward the margin; these canals may be simple or branching, and vary in number from few to many. The margin of the disk bears sensory organs and tentacles.

In the class Hydrozoa, medusae are the sexual individuals of many species, alternating in the life cycle with asexual polyps. The medusa form of Hydrozoans are known as hydromedusae. A polyp is the form that attaches to a surface, while a medusa is the form that is free-floating; a species of cnidarian may take each form in a different phase of its life.

The medusa form predominates in the classes Scyphozoa (the common, colourful, large jellyfish) and Cubozoa. Except for freshwater hydrozoans like "Craspedacusta sowerbyi", these are the only classes in which medusae appear.

Medusae may have many tentacles with which they catch their prey. Sometimes, people bathing in the ocean are touched by a medusa. Their tentacles are long and thin and covered in venomous stinging cells (known as nematocysts). They inject poison which immobilizes small fish. People who are stung should seek medical attention. There have been some deaths after severe medusa stings.


Expenditure

In economics an expenditure is when a company buys fixed assets that will create a benefit in the future, or when the company upgrades existing assets so that they can be used for a longer time. This constitutes an investment, as the benefits of the use usually last much longer than the fiscal year. Depreciation also happens: the cost that the company took to upgrade or buy the assets will usually not be deducted directly, in one year; depending on the form of calculation used, a part of the cost will be deducted each year, as a form of expense.

Zygomycota

Zygomycota, or zygote fungi, is a large group of 1600 species of fungi. 

Fungi are put into groups by the way they reproduce. The name "Zygomycota" comes from zygosporangia, where strong and tough round shaped spores are formed during sexual reproduction. 

They are mostly found living in soil or on decaying plant or animal material. Some are parasites of plants, insects, and small animals. Others form symbiotic relationships with plants, where the plant and the fungi need each other to grow. 

Zygomycete hyphae may be a syncytium, that is, having a mass of nuclei not divided into separate cells. On occasion these can be divided into separate parts by a cell wall called a septum. This only happens where gametes are formed, or to wall off dead hyphae.

There are about 15-20 million, spread over many countries; in Pakistan up to 05% of the people may follow this faith. Nizari still have an imam that is descended from Ali, the current imam is Karim Aga Khan IV.

Invisible College

The Invisible College was the name given to themselves by a group of like-minded scientists and natural philosophers in England in the mid-17th century. The informal association is considered to have been one of the origins of the Royal Society.

The purpose of the invisible college was to encourage each other to develop scientific knowledge through experiments and other kinds of investigation.

Some of the members of the Invisible College were among the founders of the Royal Society in 1660, including Robert Boyle, John Wilkins and Samuel Hartlib.

The concept of invisible college was developed in the sociology of science by Diane Crane, building on de Solla Price's work on citation networks. It is related to, but significantly different from, other concepts of expert communities, such as "Epistemic communities", or "Communities of Practice". Recently, the concept was applied to the global network of communications among scientists by Caroline S. Wagner.

In fiction it is mentioned in the novel "The Lost Symbol" by Dan Brown, and was the inspiration for the Unseen University in the works of Terry Pratchett.


List of WWE Divas Champions

The WWE Divas Championship was a professional wrestling championship made in 2008 by the WWE. The wrestlers with the most reigns as Divas Champion are Eve Torres and AJ Lee with 3 each. The longest reigning champion is Nikki Bella with the aid of her sister Brie Bella, holding the championship for 301 days. There is no longer a Divas championship as the WWE doesn't want the women to be classed as a diva and now calls them WWE Superstars like the men. The WWE Women's Championship replaced the title at WrestleMania 32.




Steve Wozniak

Stephen "Steve" Gary Wozniak (born August 11, 1950) also known by his nickname "WOZ" is an American electrical engineer, computer programmer, and philanthropist. He co-founded Apple Computer with Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne which later became Apple.

Steve Wozniak was born on August 11, 1950 in San Jose, California. He is the son of Jerry Wozniak and Margaret Kern. His father was an engineer at Lockheed Martin. Wozniak is of Polish, German, English and Irish ancestry. The family emigrated to the United States. He grew up with a strong interest in electronics. He experimented by making his own devices such as a voltmeter, ham radio and electronic games. School, however, bored him. He flunked out at the University of Colorado. He then enrolled at the University of California. In 1971, he and Steve Jobs met while working on a mainframe computer at Hewlett-Packard (HP). Like Wozniak, Jobs was interested in electronics and both hated school. Wozniak dropped out of the University of California.

Wozniak and Jobs worked out of a family garage on developing a personal computer the average person could use. Wozniak worked on the designing and building the machines while Jobs worked on marketing the computers. In 1976 they founded the company called Apple Inc.. But Wozniak was working for Hewlett-Packard at the time. As a condition of his employment he had signed an Intellectual property agreement. This meant that anything he invented was the property of Hewlett-Packard. But HP was not interested in his "Apple I" computer invention which left him free to do what he wanted with it. They began selling Apple I computers that same year. In 1977, they made their second computer called the Apple II which was very successful. They went on to produce the Apple III. But the Apple I, II and III computers were text-based machines. Jobs wanted to invent something completely new. The two were working on a new computer they called the Apple Lisa. Jobs made a deal with Xerox who then owned PARC, the Palo Alto Research Center. In return for three days access to PARC, Xerox could buy 100,000 shares of Apple stock for $10 each. Wozniak and Jobs were amazed at what they saw at PARC. Xerox had built a computer called the Xerox Alto but had not marketed it. The Alto had a Graphical user interface instead of being simply text-based. It used a computer mouse to point and click on objects on the computer's screen. Jobs decided all Apple computers from that time on would use a mouse.

In 1985, Wozniak left Apple and sold most of his stock. He remained an Apple employee and still received an annual salary. He returned to the University of California, Berkeley in 1986 to complete his degree in electrical engineering.

He also started a number of other projects. These include starting CL 9, which created a universal remote control. Wozniak founded Wheels of Zeus which developed wireless GPS-enabled products. He joined the board of directors of Danger Inc. which produces mobile computing hardware and software. He also spent a few years teaching grade school.

In 1985, US President Ronald Reagan presented Wozniak (with Steve Jobs) the National Medal of Technology. In December 1989, he received an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he studied in the late sixties. Later he donated funds to create the "Woz Lab" at the University of Colorado at Boulder. In 1997, the Computer History Museum named him one of its Fellows. Wozniak was a key contributor and benefactor to the Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose; the street in front of the museum has been renamed Woz Way in his honor.

In September 2000, Wozniak was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 2001 he was awarded the 7th Annual Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy and Employment. The American Humanist Association awarded him the Isaac Asimov Science Award in 2011.

In December 2005, Kettering University gave Wozniak an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree
He also received an honorary degrees from North Carolina State University, Nova Southeastern University, and the Telluride Tech Festival Award of Technology. In May 2011, Michigan State University gave Wozniak an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree.

On June 22, 2011, he was awarded an honorary degree at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada.

Brian Schmidt

Brian P. Schmidt (born February 24, 1967) is a Distinguished Professor, Australian Research Council Laureate Fellow and astrophysicist at the Australian National University Mount Stromlo Observatory and Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics. He is widely known for his research in using supernovae as Cosmological Probes. He currently holds an Australia Research Council Federation Fellowship. Schmidt shared both the 2006 Shaw Prize in Astronomy and the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics with Saul Perlmutter and Adam Riess for providing evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating.

Schmidt, an only child, was born February 24, 1967 in the Montana mountains. His father, Dana C. Schmidt, was a fisheries biologist. When he was 13, his family moved to Anchorage, Alaska.

Schmidt went to Bartlett High School in Anchorage, and graduated in 1985. He has said that he wanted to be a meteorologist "since I was about five-years-old" but "... I did some work at the US National Weather Service up in Anchorage and didn't enjoy it very much. It was less scientific, not as exciting as I thought it would be - there was a lot of routine. But I guess I was just a little naive about what being a meteorologist meant." He decided to study astronomy just before he started at university. He was graduated BS(Physics), BS(Astronomy) from the University of Arizona in 1989. He received his MA (1992) and then PhD from Harvard University in 1993. Schmidt's PhD thesis was supervised by Robert Kirshner and used Type II Supernovae to measure the Hubble Constant.
At Harvard, he met his future wife, an Australian, Jenny Gordon who was studying for a PhD in economics. In 1994, he moved to Australia.

Schmidt was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (1993-94) before moving to Mount Stromlo Observatory in the Australian Capital Territory in 1995. 

Schmidt and Adam Riess led the High-z Supernova Search Team which found evidence that the Universe's expansion rate is now accelerating. They discovered this by looking at Type 1a Supernova. The discovery was the opposite of the current theory that the expansion of the universe was slowing down. By studying the color shifts in the light from the supernova from Earth, they discovered that these billion-year old nova were still accelerating. This result was also found about the same time by the Supernova Cosmology Project, led by Saul Perlmutter. With two studies getting the same result scientists now accept the accelerating universe theory. New research is now trying to understand the nature of the universe, such as the existence of dark matter. The discovery of the accelerating universe was named 'Breakthrough of the Year' by Science Magazine in 1998. Schmidt was jointly awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics along with Reiss and Perlmutter for their groundbreaking work.

Schmidt is currently leading the SkyMapper telescope Project and the associated Southern Sky Survey.

Schmidt has received the Australian Governments Malcolm McIntosh Prize in 2000, Harvard University's Bok Prize in 2000, the Australian Academy of Science's Pawsey Medal Medal in 2001, and the Vainu Bappu Medal of the Astronomical Society of India in 2002. He was the Marc Aaronson Memorial Lecturer in 2005, and in 2006, he shared the Shaw Prize in Astronomy with Adam Riess and Saul Perlmutter.

Schmidt and the other members of the High-Z Team (the set defined by the co-authors of Riess et al. 1998) shared the 2007 Gruber Cosmology Prize, a $500,000 award, with Saul Perlmutter of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Supernova Cosmology Project (the set defined by the co-authors of Perlmutter et al. 1999) for their discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe.

Schmidt, along with Riess and Perlmutter, jointly won the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics for their observations which led to the discovery of the accelerating Universe.




Crab Nebula

The Crab Nebula (catalogue designations M1, NGC 1952, Taurus A) is a supernova remnant and 'pulsar wind nebula' in the constellation of Taurus. The nebula was observed by John Bevis in 1731; it corresponds to a bright supernova recorded by Chinese and Islamic astronomers in 1054. In 1840, astronomer William Parsons gave it the name it has today.

The nebula is about 6,500 light-years (2 kpc) from Earth. It has a diameter of 11 ly (3.4 pc) and expands at a rate of about 1,500 kilometers per second. It is part of the Perseus Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy.

At the center of the nebula lies the Crab pulsar, a neutron star (or spinning ball of neutrons), 28–30 km across, which emits pulses of radiation from gamma ray bursts to radio waves with a spin rate of 30.2 times per second. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion.

The nebula acts as a source of radiation for studying celestial bodies between it and us. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Sun's corona was mapped from observations of the Crab's radio waves passing through it, and in 2003, the thickness of the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan was measured as it blocked out X-rays from the nebula.

The cloudy remnants of SN 1054 are now known as the Crab Nebula. The nebula is also referred to as Messier 1 or M1, being the first Messier object catalogued in 1758.

Previous analysis showed that with X-ray and gamma ray energies above 30 keV, the Crab is the strongest persistent source in the sky. Its flux (energy emission) was known to be above 10 eV.

However, recent work has shown the energy levels are much higher than previously thought. Scientists found emissions at more than 100 GeV (gigaelectronvolts) – 100 billion times more energetic than visible light.

The creation of the Crab Nebula corresponds to the bright SN 1054 supernova, which was recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054 AD. The Crab Nebula itself was first observed in 1731 by John Bevis. The nebula was independently rediscovered in 1758 by Charles Messier as he was observing a bright comet. Messier catalogued it as the first entry in his catalogue of comet-like objects. The Earl of Rosse observed the nebula at Birr Castle in 1848, and referred to the object as the Crab Nebula because a drawing he made of it looked like a crab. 
In the early 20th century, the analysis of early photographs of the nebula taken several years apart revealed that it was expanding. Tracing the expansion back revealed that the nebula must have become visible on Earth about 900 years ago. Historical records revealed that a new star bright enough to be seen in the daytime had been recorded in the same part of the sky by Chinese astronomers in 1054. Given its great distance, the daytime 'guest star' observed by the Chinese could only have been a supernova—a massive, exploding star, having exhausted its supply of energy from nuclear fusion and collapsed in on itself.

Recent analysis of historical records have found that the supernova that created the Crab Nebula probably appeared in April or early May, rising to its maximum brightness of between apparent magnitude −7 and −4.5 (brighter than everything in the night sky except the Moon) by July. The supernova was visible to the naked eye for about two years after its first observation. Thanks to the recorded observations of Far Eastern and Middle Eastern astronomers of 1054, Crab Nebula became the first astronomical object recognized as being connected to a supernova explosion.

Trackball

In computing, a trackball is a pointing input device. It consists of a ball held by a socket containing sensors to detect a rotation of the ball about two axes. It is like an upside-down mouse with a ball that sticks out. The user rolls the ball with the thumb, fingers or the palm of the hand to move a cursor and can click one of two buttons (identical to mouse buttons) near the trackball to select desktop objects or position the cursor for text entry. Currently only three major companies: Logitech, A4Tech and Kensington make many of them. Microsoft was once a major producer. 

Large trackballs are sometimes seen on computerized special-purpose workstations, such as the radar consoles in an air traffic control room, or sonar equipment on a ship or submarine, or computer-aided design. Potentiometers capture the trackball orientation.

Many notebook and laptop computers in the late 20th century used a small trackball. It was usually located in front of the keyboard toward the user. IBM's ThinkPad series of notebook computers use a "pointing stick", called a TrackPoint, that is integrated into the middle of the keyboard keys.

Binary pulsar

A binary pulsar is a pulsar with a binary companion, often a white dwarf or neutron star. In at least one case, the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039, the companion star is another pulsar as well. 

Binary pulsars are one of the few objects which allow physicists to test general relativity in the case of a strong gravitational field. Although the binary companion to the pulsar is usually difficult or impossible to observe, the timing of the pulses from the pulsar can be measured with extraordinary accuracy by radio telescopes. Binary pulsar timing has indirectly confirmed the existence of gravitational radiation and verified Einstein's general theory of relativity.

Two objects orbiting do not do so in absolutely circular paths. the paths are virtually always elliptical. So twice a circuit they are closest, and twice a circuit they are furthest away. This is obvious for the Earth and Sun, but the idea applies much more widely.

When the two bodies are close, the gravitational field is stronger, and the passage of time is slowed. With pulsars, the time between pulses (or ticks) is lengthened. As the pulsar clock travels more slowly through the weakest part of the field it regains time. This is a relativistic time delay. It is the difference between what one would expect to see if the pulsar were moving at a constant distance and speed around its companion, and what is actually observed.

Binary pulsars are one of the few tools scientists have to detect evidence of gravitational waves. Einstein’s theory of general relativity predicts that two neutron stars would emit gravitational waves as they orbit a common center of mass, which would carry away orbital energy, and cause the two stars to draw closer together. As the two stellar bodies draw closer to one another, often one pulsar will absorb matter from the other, causing a violent accretion process. This interaction can heat the gas being exchanged between the bodies and produce X-ray light which can appear to pulsate, causing binary pulsars to occasionally be referred to as X-ray binaries. This flow of matter from one stellar body to another is known as an accretion disk. Millisecond pulsars (or MSP's) create a sort of "wind", which in the case of binary pulsars can blow away the magnetosphere of the neutron stars and have a dramatic effect on the pulse emission.

The first binary pulsar, PSR B1913+16 or the "Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar" was discovered in 1974 at Arecibo by Joseph Taylor and Russell Hulse, for which they won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics. Pulses from this system have been tracked, without glitches, to within 15 μs since its discovery.

The 1993 Nobel Prize was awarded to Joseph Taylor and Russell Hulse after they discovered two such stars. While Hulse was observing a new pulsar, named PSR B1913+16, he noticed that the frequency with which it pulsed fluctuated. It was concluded that the simplest explanation was that the pulsar was orbiting another star very closely at a high velocity. Hulse and Taylor determined that the stars were equally heavy by observing these pulse fluctuations, which led them to believe the other spacial object was also a neutron star.

The observations made of the orbital decay of this star system was a near perfect match to Einstein’s equations. Relativity predicts that over time a binary system’s orbital energy will be converted to gravitational radiation. Data collected by Taylor and his colleagues of the orbital period of PRS B1913+16 supported this relativistic prediction. They reported in 1983 that there was a difference in the observed minimum separation of the two pulsars compared to that expected if the orbital separation had remained constant. In the decade following its discovery the system’s orbital period had decreased by about 76 millionths of a second per year. This means the pulsar was approaching its maximum separation more than a second earlier than it would have if the orbit had remained the same. Subsequent observations continue to show this decrease.

Mount Stromlo Observatory

Mount Stromlo Observatory (MSO) just outside of Canberra, Australia, is part of the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Australian National University (ANU).

The observatory was built in 1924 as The Commonwealth Solar Observatory. Mount Stromlo had already been used for observations in the previous decade, with a small observatory being built in 1911 by Pietro Baracchi using the Oddie telescope. The dome built to house the Oddie telescope was the first Commonwealth building built in the new Australian Capital Territory. Until World War II, the observatory specialised in solar and atmospheric observations. During the war the workshops made gun sights, and other optical equipment. After the war, the observatory began stellar and galactic astronomy and was renamed The Commonwealth Observatory.

When ANU began in 1946 in nearby Canberra, they shared staff and started graduate studies. In 1957 the Mount Stromlo Observatory became part of the ANU.

On January 18, 2003, a huge bushfire hit Canberra and Mount Stromlo. The observatory was surrounded by a plantation pine forest. Five telescopes, workshops, seven homes and the historic administration building were destroyed. The only telescope to escape the fires was the 1868 15-centimetre Farnham telescope. Some items from the fire are on display in the National Museum of Australia. They include a melted telescope mirror and a piece of melted optical glass (flint). The latter has pieces of charcoal and wire fused into it from the fierce heat of the fire.

Rebuilding is largely completed and the Observatory is now a major partner in the construction of the Giant Magellan Telescope. A copy of the Oddie telescope has been put on display at the observatory.

The MACHO project found the first example of the gravitational lensing of one star by another, known as Gravitational microlensing, in 1993 (Alcock et al. 1993; Paczynski 1996). This discovery was made by repeated imaging of the Magellanic Clouds with the 50-inch Great Melbourne Telescope using a mosaic of 8 2048 by 2048 pixel CCDs. The camera was made by the Centre for Particle Astrophysics in California (CFPA). At the time it was the largest digital camera ever built (Frame & Faulkner 2003). Between July 1992 and December 1999, the MACHO project made over 200 billion stellar measurements. The data was studied at the observatory and at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

Brian Schmidt, an astrophysicist at Mount Stromlo, led an international group, the High-z Supernova Search Team, which looked at the rate of change of the Cosmic Expansion using type Ia supernovae. In 1998, the team discovered that cosmic expansion was accelerating, which was the opposite of the current theory. This universal acceleration means that dark energy must exist. The discovery was named the top science breakthrough of 1998 by "Science" magazine. In 2011, Brian Schmidt shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Saul Perlmutter and Adam Riess for finding the evidence for the accelerating Universe.

The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, co-led by Matthew Colless, began the largest galaxy red shift survey of its time. It was based at the Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO) using the 3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope between 1997 and 11 April 2002. The survey measured more than 245,000 galaxies. With the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, this provided the measurements of large scale structure in the low-redshift Universe.

The workshops at Mount Stromlo Observatory have built two instruments for the Gemini Telescope. This includes the near infrared integral field spectrometer, NIFS, used on Gemini-North, and the adaptive optics imager for Gemini-South, GSAOI. The NIFS was destroyed in the bushfires of 18 January 2003 and had to be rebuilt.

A new rapid survey telescope, SkyMapper, is under construction. SkyMapper will be built at the ANU's other observatory (Siding Spring) and operated remotely from Mount Stromlo.

Mount Stromlo Observatory is at an altitude of above sea level on Mount Stromlo.



Pietro Baracchi

Pietro Paolo Giovanni Ernesto Baracchi (1851–1926) was an Italian astronomer. He moved to Australia in the 1870s and worked at the Melbourne Observatory. In 1910 the Australian government asked him to find a suitable place for an observatory in the new Australian Capital Territory. Barrachi set up a small observatory on Mount Stromlo in May 1911. This was the first government building in Canberra and was the beginning of the Mount Stromlo Observatory. The observatory had a 9-inch (23 cm) telescope, donated by Ballarat gold miner, James Oddie.

Melbourne Observatory

The Melbourne Observatory, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, was built in 1861. It replaced an earlier observatory at Williamstown. The Melbourne Observatory is now part of Melbourne's Royal Botanic Gardens. The observatory had an important role as it used observations of the stars to keep accurate time. It also kept the weather records and scientists were able to make weather predictions.

In 1869 the observatory installed the Great Melbourne Telescope (48 inch) which at that time was the largest steerable telescope in world. There were problems with its size and image accuracy and by 1890 it was no longer used. As Melbourne increased in size the light from the city limited the use of the observatory for serious astronomy. The Great Melbourne Telescope was sold to the Mount Stromlo Observatory in Canberra in 1944. It was destroyed in a bushfire in 2003, but there are plans to rebuild it and set it up as a display at the Melbourne Observatory.

The Melbourne Observatory is no longer used, but the historic equipment is kept in working condition by the Astronomical Society of Victoria. This is an amateur group of volunteers interested in astronomy. They have regular tours, talks and observation nights using the telescopes. The historic buildings are now used as offices for the gardens, a cafe and a shop.

Mèng Kē (), who is usually known as Meng Zi ()，which means "Master Meng," or Mencius (which is the Latin form of Meng Zi), was not in the generation of students who worked directly with Confucius, but in the second generation after it. He lived from about 371 B.C. to about 289 B.C. Mencius regarded Confucius as the greatest teacher, and he wrote a book in which he tried to explain the full picture behind what Confucius taught. The book is just called by his name, so in English it is called the "Mencius."

In his book, Mencius taught that humans are born with four gifts: The first is the natural ability to feel what other people feel and to want to help and protect them. The second is to recognize when you are not doing your share of the job of maintaining a good society. The third is to recognize conflict situations before they grow big and to defuse them. The fourth is to recognize when some other people are hurting other people and want to obtain justice for those being hurt.

Mencius believed that just as the people owed things to the ruler, the ruler also owed things to the people. So if a man held the position of ruler but did not do the things for the people that a ruler should do, then it was acceptable for the people to get rid of the ruler, and even to kill him.

Mencius lived during the Zhōu dynasty.

The culture that Mencius came from believed that after people died they would have some kind of existence after life. That belief goes back to prehistorical times. At some time, people began to say that the dead go to 天 Tiān. Tiān has several meanings including "sky," "day," "Heaven," and "God." The earliest versions of the character 天 is a picture of a man with a very large head, which suggests "head man" or "leader." Since Chinese people believed that when any person dies he or she goes to Tiān, and that dead ancestors are more powerful than they were while still alive, it is possible that Tiān originally was the name of the earliest ancestor of the Zhōu ruling house from long before the fall of the previous dynasty, the Shàng. If that idea is correct, then "Tiān" first was a name for an ancestor. Later people may have forgotten that this very powerful spirit was originally a living human being, so Tiān became regarded as a god. After that, "Tiān" could have been used to name the place where the god lived, and since that place was high above us, it came to mean not only "Heaven," but also "the heavens," "sky," "day," etc.

China has myths that go back long before the Shàng and Zhōu dynasties. There were several culture heroes who were regarded as ancient wise emperors. There were Huáng Dì, known in English as the Yellow Emperor, Yáo, Shùn, and Yǚ, who all came before what is called the first dynasty, the Xià.

The story of how Yǚ came to be made emperor is very important to the Confucians. The myth says that the world started to become flooded and the father of Yǚ (whose name was Gǔn) tried to fix the problem by building dams. Gǔn was not successful because the water just kept coming and when it went over the top of the dams then all of the water that had built up came out very fast. So Yǚ took over the job of saving China and cleaned out all of the rivers so that the extra water could easily go to the sea.

Mencius does not tell the part of the story about Gǔn, but he does tell the part about how Yǚ made all the rivers deeper to drain the land. The lesson Mencius and the Chinese people learned from the story of Yǚ was that in all things it is better to give forces a way to get out that will not cause harm, and that damming forces up will always be bad in the long run.

The founders of the Zhōu dynasty believed in the idea that King Wen, the father of King Wu (who was the first to actually rule after the Shàng rulers were defeated), continued to be able to act in the world of human beings even after his death. He and his own father and grandfather were central figures in an important document called "The Brass-bound Coffer." Another important document is called "The Announcement of Duke Shao." Both of these documents introduce and support the idea that Tiān decides who will be the human to act as steward or helper to carry out the will of Tiān on earth, and the idea that Tiān will only let someone be king as long as he looks out for the welfare of all human beings.

Mencius told the story of Yü in his book at 3B:9:

At the time of [the sage emperor] Yao, the rivers ceased their normal flow and flooded the Central Kingdom. Then snakes and dragons took up residence and humans had no fixed abodes. Those in lower places created nests in the trees for themselves, and those in higher places made underground redoubts.

The "Book of Records" says: "The inundation alarms me." "Inundation" means "flood waters." Yü was employed to manage the flood. Yü dredged the earth and conveyed the water to the sea. He drove away the snakes and dragons and exiled them to the marshes. When water traveled through the land it formed the Yangze River, the Huai River, the Yellow River, and the Han River. Since the marshes were in remote and cut off places, the depredations visited upon humans by birds and beasts were eliminated, and after that humans got to live on the plains. After people's memories of both Yao and Shun fell into obscurity the way of the sages went into a steep decline.

At 4B:26, Mencius also said:If these wise ones could conduct themselves as did Yü in managing the flood waters, then what would there be to dislike about them? Yü managed the flood waters by doing his work in ways that involved no great fuss. If these wise ones could also conduct themselves without making any fuss, then their wisdom would be great.

For Mencius, Yü's way of doing things was the best. Yü was one of the great heroes of Mencius.

In the West there was a scientist named Konrad Lorenz (1903 - 1989) who studied animals. He was an ethologist, which means that he carefully studied the behavior of animals and tried to understand why they do the things that they ordinarily do. He saw, for instance, that if baby ducks see a human instead of a duck right after they hatch, they will ever after follow humans and take them to be their parents. He called this kind of learning "imprinting."

Mencius studied humans the way Lorenz studied other animals. Mencius was an ethologist too, but in the language of ancient China he was regarded as a "master," that is, a teacher. He was a Confucian, and Confucianism is sometimes called a religion. However, Mencius does not quote religious texts and try to get people to act the way those books say to act. He also does not name fundamental truths or axioms and try to figure out how people ought to act. So he is not like most people that we regard as either religious leaders or philosophers.

In modern times we separate philosophy from science, but in earlier times the kinds of studies we now call science were called "natural philosophy," and Mencius was basically a natural philosopher. His work led to the same general kind of knowledge that Lorenz learned about ducks and other animals. Mencius asked: what kinds of things do people do that keep families and communities working well, what kinds of things do they do that harm families and communities, and why do they do these thing?

Mencius said that we do not need to teach people to love the taste of good food. The feeling we have for fine cooking is natural. Similarly, he said, we have other natural feelings that are good gifts that we are all born with. We cannot really get rid of these gifts except by destroying ourselves, but we can allow them to be covered over so that they do not work right. It is a little like the way humans cannot just take off their noses and throw them away, but they can put plugs in their nostrils and spoil their ability to smell things. So it is important that humans not do anything that would prevent their four gifts from working well. It is too bad that people often let their four gifts get messed up. When humans are well nurtured and are protected from negative forces, then they will be good of their own free will.

The virtues or powers that humans have are things that they get directly from Heaven. These same things are in Heaven. When people do bad things, it is because their other parts have taken control away from their virtues/powers. Mencius gives a wonderful story that is called Ox Mountain as proof.

The Chinese word for what has been called "gifts" above is dé. It is a cognate of a word that means "to get," so one way of explaining it is to say that a dé is something that we get from Heaven. It means "virtue," but only in the sense that it is the power to do something. ("Virtue" has this meaning in English, too.) Humans have four virtues or powers. Here are their Chinese names, a translation of each, and an explanation of each:





Human beings might be able to live perfect lives if they had only these four kinds of motivations or emotional reactions to the world, but they have many other motivations. They include fear, anger, greed for wealth and power, sex, etc. Humans very easily learn that they can satisfy these drives more easily if they ignore the inputs from their virtues. For instance, a child who is large for his age may easily learn that he can take by force whatever he wants from other children his age.

Human beings are born with the four powers that would keep them from doing bad things, and they are also born with the many drives or motivations that can lead them to do bad things to satisfy these needs. So what determines who will be good and who will be bad?

Mencius observed that humans depend on one more important mental function. He called it the Zhì, which can sometimes be translated as "aspirations," but which in the case of Mencius is what we would call the will. Something has to decide what to do when the ethical impulses, the moral feelings, of what Mencius called the "four virtues," conflict with the ordinary impulses that are involved with hunger, sex, aggression, fear, etc. The part of humans that balances things and makes decisions is the zhì.

For Mencius, if an individual is functioning well, then his or her will can strike a healthy balance among all the impulses and can keep the virtues from being swamped by the ordinary desires. If a person's will is not in control, then that person may do damage to himself or herself, or to other people. So it is important while growing up to learn how to keep the zhì from getting taken over by other forces—or by other people.

The individual has a free-will choice about whether to integrate (put together so they will not fight each other) all his impulses and also his intellect, or to give up and just act on whatever impulse is being felt at the moment. So for Mencius the best path for a human being is to plan and to act to make himself or herself well balanced, integrated (not in a fight with himself or herself and wanting to do both one thing and its opposite), and so a useful person to society.

Somebody who operates at the very high end of the moral scale by "having his act together" is called a jūn zǐ, or "morally noble man." Mencius said: "That by which humans differ from the birds and the beasts is extremely small. Ordinary people get rid of it, but the morally noble man keeps it safe. [The sage emperor] Shun clearly saw the many creatures, and he made a close examination of human social relationships. His actions came out of his benevolence and his sense of duty. He did not act out [a phony] benevolence and sense of duty." So a jūn zǐ is somebody who has managed to hold onto the gifts that Heaven has given him, the gifts that can make humans act with benevolence, be led by a sense of duty, want to act in ways that will keep good relations with others, and try to aid and protect people who are being treated unfairly. To be a real jūn zǐ, the person has to have these true feelings and to act on them. It is not enough just to act as though one has these feelings.

According to Mencius, anyone can choose become a morally noble man. All it would take would be to really make that decision and then do it. Mencius talked about Yan Yuan, who was the favorite disciple of Confucius:

Yan Yuan said: "What kind of a man was Shun? What kind of a man am I? All it takes to be like him is to do it."

Of course Mencius realized that "just doing it" is much harder than talking about it. One has to keep watching oneself all the time.

One goal that Mencius had was to grow what he called an "unmovable mind." By those words he meant a mind that could not be knocked around by being hit from the outside. An "unmovable mind" is guarded against doing the wrong thing because one is angry, afraid, etc. Anything that can pull or push from the outside and make us go out of control could cause harm, but Mencius says that if the will and the four virtues/powers are well integrated, if the person is "really together," then these outside forces cannot take over control.

Every culture and every society has developed ways to prevent children from getting into too much trouble. Even in one community people may used several different strategies for getting and keeping control over their children. One way of controlling children is to beat them when they do things that the parents do not want them to do. Another way of controlling children is to make them feel guilty and expect to be severely punished because they are bad humans. A third way is to make children feel shame and expect people to laugh at them and then turn away from them. Method number four is to explain to children the likely results of their actions. "If you pull the dog's ears he will bite you." Many parents the world over use more than one of these methods, and they may use all of them from time to time.

The Chinese culture has another method that may not be well known and may be rarely practiced in other places—calling forth the use of the child's own virtue/power. When a child does something hurtful to someone else, instead of telling the child how bad he or she is the parents may say something like: "Just now we saw you take the eggs out of the sparrow's nest. We know that you are a good person at heart. So we wonder whether you thought about how the mother sparrow will feel when she comes back and finds her children gone. Would you like to put the eggs back now while they are still warm? The mother sparrow will be coming back soon."

The object of getting the child to look at the feelings that come up in his heart/mind when he or she really thinks about what he or she did is not to make the child feel like a horrible person, and not to make the child fear punishment. Once the child really listens to the quiet voice of what we in the West would call "the conscience," then the child will naturally feel what the mother sparrow would feel if she came home to an empty nest. The child will then do something so that the mother sparrow will not need to have that bad feeling. The next time the child may think about how the mother sparrow will feel before he or she steals any eggs.

It takes a long time to get really good at listing to these four gifts from Heaven, and it takes practice to understand the possible consequences of some things that one might do. So becoming a really good person is a lifetime job that is never really finished. In the traditional Chinese society, young people were encouraged to read both the stories of the past that showed good acts and also to read the books by people like Confucius and Mencius to get help in learning to see all the results and learning how to keep anger, fear, and all the other ordinary emotions from overpowering the four moral virtues/powers.

Radio frequency

The term Radio frequency refers to electromagnetic radiation in the range of frequencies lower than microwaves. Radio waves at these frequencies have been found useful for long-range communications. Among these frequencies, shortwave radio communications operate at frequencies that can be reflected by the ionosphere and therefore can bounce around the earth. Longwave frequencies are used for relatively short range communications such as the most ordinary of the commercial amplitude modulation (AM) radio stations. Their transmissions ordinarily do not get long bounces.

Different short-wave frequencies (with wavelengths shorter than 120 meters) can be reflected well and transmitted by long bounces around the world during times when different conditions prevail in the ionosphere. So transmitters for such organizations as VOA (Voice of America) and BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) will change operating frequencies from month to month and also from time to time during a 24 hour period.

White-flippered penguin

The white-flippered penguin ("Eudyptula minor albosignata") is a subspecies of the little penguin. Their name comes from the unique white edges on their flippers (wings).

Saraikistan

Saraikistan (Saraiki, Punjabi, ) describes a cultural geographic region in the southwest of the Punjab province in Pakistan. Some residents of the region support the idea forming a new province of Saraikistan, in part motivated by movements promoting the Saraiki language.

Hexachlorobenzene

Hexachlorobenzene is an aromatic compound. The molecule structure resembles benzene, except that hydrogen atoms are replaced by chlorine. It is a colorless powder that is produced using catalysis from Iron(III) chloride or from Hexachlorocyclohexane. Hexachlorobenzene was used as a fungicide, mostly to treat cereals. The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants forbids its production and use. The main reason for this restriction was that the outbreaks of rare diseases. Certain people eating food that had been treated became ill, and the illness could be linked to this substance. 

Chlordane

Chlordane is an insecticide, introduced in 1947. It is an organochloride that acts like a contact poison. It can be produced using the Diels–Alder reaction, and has at least 147 constituents. Its main use was in treating seeds, e.g. of potatoes, wheat, or vegetables. It was also used for wood preservation, and against ants and termites. Chlordane only degrades slowly, which means that it is relatively easy to spread it over long distances. It accumulates in the body of animals, in mammals mostly in the nervous system and the liver. Chlordane has been shown to cause cancer in mice; it may cause cancer in humans. Chlordane is toxic. It is listed in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.

Aldrin

Aldrin is an insecticide, which was used against termites, locusts and the larvae of Click beetles. Most plants and animals convert it to Dieldrin. It is listed in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, its production, use and trade are banned since 2004. Aldrin is a neurotoxin. People inhaling it can develop headaches, but also seizures. In humans, Aldrin is converted to dieldrin in the liver. The change will mean that it can leave the body again. The problem is that the change is slow, and the half-life is about a year. Aldrin may be a teratogen, and it probably causes cancer. 
Aldrin is produced by combining hexachlorocyclopentadiene with norbornadiene in a Diels-Alder reaction to give the adduct.
Aldrin is named after the German chemist Kurt Alder, one of the coinventors of this kind of reaction. An estimated 270 million kilograms of aldrin and related cyclodiene pesticides were produced between 1946 and 1976.

In soil, on plant surfaces, or in the digestive tracts of insects, aldrin oxidizes to the epoxide, dieldrin. Dieldrin is more strongly insecticidal than aldrin.

Mirex

Mirex is a chlorinated hydrocarbon that was commercialized as an insecticide. It was later banned because it was harmful to the environment. This white crystalline odorless solid is a derivative of cyclopentadiene. It was popularized to control fire ants but by virtue of its chemical robustness and lipophilicity it was recognized as a bioaccumulative pollutant. However, the spread of the red imported fire ant was actually encouraged by the use of Mirex, as it also kills native ants that are highly competitive with the fire ants. The United States Environmental Protection Agency prohibited its use in 1976.

Dieldrin

Dieldrin is a chlorinated hydrocarbon originally produced in 1948 by J. Hyman & Co, Denver, as an insecticide. Dieldrin is closely related to aldrin. Aldrin reacts further to form dieldrin. Aldrin is not toxic to insects; it is oxidized in the insect to form dieldrin which is the active compound. Both dieldrin and aldrin are named after the Diels-Alder reaction which is used to form aldrin from a mixture of norbornadiene and hexachlorocyclopentadiene.

Dieldrin was developed as an alternative to DDT and has proved to be a highly effective insecticide. It was very widely used during the 1950s to early 1970s. Endrin is a stereoisomer of dieldrin.

However, it is an extremely persistent organic pollutant; it does not degrade easily. Furthermore, it tends to biomagnify as it is passed along the food chain. Long-term exposure has proven toxic to a very wide range of animals including humans. For this reason it is now banned in most of the world.

It has been linked to health problems such as Parkinson's disease, breast cancer, and immune, reproductive, and nervous system damage. It can also adversely affect testicular descent in the fetus if a pregnant woman is exposed to Dieldrin.

Dieldrin is listed in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.

It can be formed from the synthesis of hexachloro-1,3-cyclopentadiene with norbornadiene in a Diels-Alder reaction, followed by epoxidation of the norbornene ring.
Dieldrin is named after Otto Paul Hermann Diels, the co-inventor of the Diels-Alder reaction.

Endrin

Endrin is an insecticide that was commonplace among cotton growers and for the treament of cereals. It was also used to kill rodents. It is a neurotoxin. It is a stereoisomer of Dieldrin. In the soil, it can take up to twelve years to decay. It is one of the twelve substances listed in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, and its production, trade and use is banned since 2004.

Mount Stromlo

Mount Stromlo is west of the centre of Canberra, Australia, near the district of Weston Creek. It is about above sea level and above the surrounding plains. The Mount Stromlo Observatory (run by the Australian National University) is on the top of the mountain. Canberra's main water supply treatment plant, supplied by the Cotter River catchment area is nearby. Road access to the mountain is by Cotter Road on the south side, and Uriarra Road on the east and north. The summit is reached by a road joining Cotter road just outside Duffy.

The mountain had been part of the Yarralumla Station, a farm now used as the residence the Governor-General of Australia. It was named Mount Stromlo by Frederick Campbell in the 1880s, but it is not known where he got the name.
Mount Stromlo was chosen by Pietro Baracchi in 1910 as the site for an observatory. The first telescope installed at Mount Stromlo was the Oddie telescope on 8 September 1911. The building housing this telescope was the first built by the Australian government in Canberra. In January 1913 the first telephone was connected to the Queanbeyan telephone exchange.

Mount Stromlo was burnt during bushfires in 2003. The fire burnt a pine plantation that covered the mountain, destroyed much of the observatory and water treatment plant.

Before the 2003 fires, Mount Stromlo had some of the best and oldest mountain bike trails in Australia. In May 2006 the trails were rebuilt and made bigger. Stromlo Forest Park now has more than 35 km of cross country single trail, a Four-Cross course, several observed trials areas and a downhill track. The 2009 Union Cycliste Internationale Mountain Bike and Trials World Championships were held at Mount Stromlo. About 30,000 visitors from up to 40 countries came to the event. More than 750 of the world's top riders took part in the four mountain bike sports of Cross Country, Downhill, Four Cross and Observed Trials.

Mount Stromlo also has a large building for events, with offices and change rooms. There is a children's play ground, barbecues, a road cycling circuit, a grass cross country running track and horse riding trails.

The rock on Mount Stromlo is ignimbrite from a volcanic eruption during the upper Silurian period. This is covering rhyodacite from a much earlier period, which can be seen on the surface on the lower slopes in the east and southeast sides. The northern lower slopes are covered with a calcareous shale also from the Silurian period. This is cut off on the northwest side by the Winslade Fault, which heads northeast to Cook and Kaleen. A spur fault heads off east from the Winslade Fault to under the Scrivener Dam. On the other side (northwest and north) of these faults are middle Silurian period rhyodacite volcanic deposits. The northern side has been uplifted compared with the southern side.
Stoney Creek and its tributaries drain the north side of the mountain, The east side drains into the Molonglo River. The south side supplies Blugar creek that runs into the Murrumbidgee River.

The top of the mountain near the observatory runs in a north-south direction with a spur running to the southwest where the water treatment plant is.

Page layout

Page layout is a part of typography and graphic design. It deals with the arrangement and style of elements (content) on a page.

Page design has long been a consideration in printed material. It began with early illuminated manuscripts in the hand-copied books of the Middle Ages. Today, modern magazine and catalogue layouts, (and other print media) consist of type (text), images (pictures), and occasionally place-holder graphics for elements that are not printed with ink such as die/laser cutting, foil stamping or blind embossing.

Since the advent of computing, page layout skills are used on electronic media as well as print. The electronic page–the graphical user interface (GUI)–is often where design now takes place.

A page layout may be designed in a rough paper and pencil sketch before producing, or produced during the design process to the final form. Both design and production may be achieved using hand tools or page layout software. Producing a web page may require knowledge of markup languages along with WYSIWYG software. Special considerations must be made for how the layout of an HTML page will change (reflow) when resized by the end-user. Cascading style sheets are often required to keep the page layout consistent between web browsers.

Grids and templates are page layout design patterns used in advertising campaigns and multiple-page publications, including websites.


Most desktop publishing software allows for grids in the form of a page filled with coloured lines or dots placed at a specified equal horizontal and vertical distance apart. Automatic margins and booklet spine (gutter) lines may be specified for global use throughout the document. Multiple additional horizontal and vertical lines may be placed at any point on the page. Invisible to the end-user/audience shapes may be placed on the page as guidelines for page layout and print processing as well. Software templates are achieved by duplicating a template data file, or with master page features in a multiple-page document. Master pages may include both grid elements and template elements such as header and footer elements, automatic page numbering, and automatic table of contents features.

With modern media content retrieval and output technology, there is much overlap between visual communications (front-end) and information technology (back-end). Large print publications (thick books, especially instructional in nature) and electronic pages (web pages) require meta data for automatic indexing, automatic reformatting, database publishing, dynamic page display and end-user interactivity. Much of the meta data (meta tags) must be hand coded or specified during the page layout process. This divides the task of page layout between artists and engineers, or tasks the artist/engineer to do both.

More complex projects may require two separate designs: page layout design as the front-end, and function coding as the back-end. In this case, the front-end may be designed using an alternative page layout technology such as image editing software or on paper with hand rendering methods. Most image editing software includes features for converting a page layout for use in a "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) editor or features to export graphics for desktop publishing software. WYSIWYG editors and desktop publishing software allow front-end design prior to back end-coding in most cases. Interface design and database publishing may involve more technical knowledge or collaboration with information technology engineering in the front-end.

Eric Carle

Eric Carle (June 25, 1929 – May 23, 2021) was an American children's author and illustrator. Carle illustrated more than 70 books with some being best sellers. More than 102 million copies of his books have been sold worldwide. His best known work is the 1969 book, "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" which has been translated into over 50 different languages. 

Carle was born in Syracuse, New York. He was drafted into the U.S. Army during the Korean War and was stationed in Germany with the Second Armored Division and was appointed the position of mail clerk. Carle had a son and a daughter.

Carle died on May 23, 2021 at his studio home in Northampton, Massachusetts from kidney failure aged 91.


The Very Hungry Caterpillar

The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a children's book by American writer Eric Carle. It is Carle's most famous book, it has been translated into over 50 different languages and has sold 30 million copies worldwide. The book is about a caterpillar that eats food until pupating and becoming a butterfly. The book was inspired by a hole puncher. The New York Times named it as one of the "Ten Best Picture Books of the Year" in 1969. Google celebrated the book's 40th anniversary in 2009 by changing the logo on its main search page to the style used in the book.


Duluth lynchings

The 1920 Duluth lynchings occurred when a mob attacked and lynched three black circus workers in Duluth, Minnesota. Beforehand there were rumours that black people had raped a teenager. A physician who examined the girl found no evidence of rape or assault.

The killings shocked the country, particularly because they had occurred in the northern United States. Four other lynchings had occurred in Minnesota before that time. In 2003, the city of Duluth erected a memorial to the murdered workers. 

Lynching

Lynching is the execution of a person or persons, by the people of an area without the use of a court trial. Often the people lynched have been hanged. Other forms of lynching include being dragged to death behind a car, burning and use of a gun. What makes the execution a lynching is the nature of it being done without a court trial by people who believe the accused is guilty of a crime. Lynchings have been used in the southern states of the United States of America against African Americans during the time of slavery but more commonly after the abolition of slavery during the time of civil rights activism and the times of the various Ku Klux Klans. Lynching continues to be a problem to this day, and is not just limited to southern states. Lynching is murder, and many times the people who do it are never punished. One horrific example of Lynching is Lynching of Jesse Washington.

United States lynchings rose in number after the American Civil War in the early-to-mid 1860s.

Most lynchings went down by the 1950s.

Most lynchings were of African American men in the South. But women were also lynched. Also, white lynchings of blacks happened in the Midwest and Border States. Sometimes whites were also lynched. There were also lynchings of Native Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans in the West, including California.

MERLIN

MERLIN, the Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network, is an array of radio telescopes. It is spread across Great Britain. There are seven radio telescopes in the array. MERLIN is run by Jodrell Bank Observatory, by the University of Manchester. It is run as a national facility on behalf of the Science and Technology Facilities Council.

Grouped data

Grouped data is a statistical term used in data analysis. Raw data can be organized by grouping together similar measurements in a table. This frequency table is also called grouped data.

For example, someone gave a group of students a simple math question, and timed how long it took them to answer it. The numbers are below:

The smallest amount of time was 8 seconds, and the largest was 34 seconds. One method we could use to analyze the needed time is to group close numbers together. In order to keep the analysis fair, we'll make each group be the same number of seconds. We can then count how many students fell in each group. For example, if we organized scores into 5 second ranges:

Another way to group data is to organize the scores data into groups based on their performance. Suppose there are three types of students:

then the grouped data looks like the following:

An estimate, formula_1, of the mean can be calculated from grouped data.

Note that this estimated mean may be different from the sample mean of the ungrouped data. The mean of the grouped data in the above example can be calculated as follows:

Therefore, the mean of the grouped data is

Winnipeg Jets (1972–96)

The Winnipeg Jets were a professional ice hockey team from Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Jets played in the National Hockey League for 17 seasons before being relocated to Phoenix, Arizona and were renamed the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996. A new Winnipeg Jets team was relocated back to Winnipeg from the Atlanta Thrashers in 2011.

F♯ (musical note)

F♯ (eff-sharp or F-sharp; also known as fa dièse or fi) is the seventh semitone of the solfège.

It lies a chromatic semitone above F and a diatonic semitone below G, thus being enharmonic to Sol Bémol or G (G-flat).


A (musical note)

La or A is the sixth note of the solfège. "A" is generally used as a standard for tuning. When the orchestra tunes, the oboe plays an "A" and the rest of the instruments tune to match that pitch. Every string instrument in the orchestra has an A string, from which each player can tune the rest of their instrument.

A0 is the lowest note on the standard piano. The octaves follow A1, A2, etc.. A7 is a few pitches lower than C8, the highest note on the standard piano. The note "A" is not considered to be a certain milestone or mark to hit with voice as, for example, Tenor C is, but it can be extremely demanding in certain octaves.




American Old West

The American Old West, or the Wild West means the history, geography, people, and culture of life in the Western United States. This often referring to the period of the later half of the 19th century, between the American Civil War and the end of the century. 

This time is often shown in films like "The Searchers", "High Noon" and "Shane", in TV series like "Bonanza" and in fiction like "Little House on the Prairie". Like other popular historical themes such as pirates and ninjas, the relationship between fact and fiction is complex.

Desktop publishing

Desktop publishing (also known as DTP) is the creation of documents using page layout software on a personal computer.

The term has been used for publishing at all levels, from small-circulation documents such as local newsletters to books, magazines and newspapers. However the term implies a more professional-looking end result, with a more complex layout, than word processing, and so when introduced in the 1980s was often used in connection with homes and small organisations who could not previously produce publication-quality documents themselves.

Desktop publishing began in 1985 with the introduction of MacPublisher, the first WYSIWYG layout program, which ran on the original 128K Macintosh computer. The DTP market exploded in 1985 with the introduction in January of the Apple LaserWriter printer, and later in July with the introduction of PageMaker software from Aldus which rapidly became the DTP industry standard software.

Before the advent of desktop publishing, the only option available to most persons for producing typed (as opposed to handwritten) documents was a typewriter, which offered only a handful of typefaces (usually fixed-width) and one or two font sizes. Indeed, one popular desktop publishing book was actually titled "The Mac is not a typewriter". The ability to create WYSIWYG page layouts on screen and then print pages containing text and graphical elements at crisp 300 dpi resolution was revolutionary for both the typesetting industry and the personal computer industry. Newspapers and other print publications made the move to DTP-based programs from older layout systems in the 1980s.

The term "desktop publishing" is attributed to Aldus Corporation founder Paul Brainerd, who sought a marketing catch-phrase to describe the small size and relative affordability of this software in contrast to the expensive commercial phototypesetting equipment of the day.

Behind-the-scenes technologies developed by Adobe Systems set the foundation for professional desktop publishing applications. Although Macintosh-based systems would continue to dominate the market, in 1986, the GEM-based Ventura Publisher was introduced for MS-DOS computers. While PageMaker's pasteboard metaphor closely simulated creating layouts manually, Ventura Publisher automated layout through its use of style sheets. This software automatically generated indices and other body matter. This made it suitable for manuals and other long-format documents.

During its early years, desktop publishing acquired a bad reputation as a result of untrained users who created poorly-organized layouts — similar criticism would be levied again against early Web publishers a decade later. However, some were able to realize truly professional results.

There are two types of pages in desktop publishing, electronic pages and virtual paper pages to be printed on paper. All computerized documents are technically electronic, and are limited in size only by computer memory or computer data storage space.

Virtual paper pages will ultimately be printed, and therefore require paper parameters that coincide with international standard physical paper sizes such as "A4," "letter," etc., if not custom sizes for trimming. Some desktop publishing programs allow custom sizes designated for large format printing used in posters, billboards and trade show displays. A virtual page for printing has a predesignated size of virtual printing material and can be viewed on a monitor in WYSIWYG format. Each page for printing has trim sizes (edge of paper) and a printable area if bleed printing is not possible as is the case with most desktop printers.

A web page is an example of an electronic page that is not constrained by virtual paper parameters. Most electronic pages may be dynamically re-sized, causing either the content to scale in size with the page or causing the content to re-flow.

Master pages are templates used to automatically copy or link elements and graphic design styles to some or all the pages of a multipage document. Linked elements can be modified without having to change each instance of an element on pages that use the same element. Master pages can also be used to apply graphic design styles to automatic page numbering.

Page layout is how the elements are laid on the page orderly, aesthetically, and precisely. Main types of components to be laid out on a page include text, linked images that can only be modified as an external source, and embedded images that may be modified with the layout application software. Some embedded images are rendered in the application software, while others can be placed from an external source image file. Text may be keyed into the layout, placed, or (with database publishing applications) linked to an external source of text which allows multiple editors to develop a document at the same time.

Graphic design styles such as color, transparency, and filters, may also be applied to layout elements. Typography styles may be applied to text automatically with style sheets. Some layout programs include style sheets for images in addition to text. Graphic styles for images may be border shapes, colors, transparency, filters, and a parameter designating the way text flows around the object called "wraparound" or "runaround."

While desktop publishing software still provides extensive features necessary for print publishing, modern word processors now have publishing capabilities beyond those of many older DTP applications, blurring the line between word processing and desktop publishing.

In the early days of graphical user interfaces, DTP software was in a class of its own when compared to the fairly spartan word processing applications of the time. Programs such as WordPerfect and WordStar were still mainly text-based and offered little in the way of page layout, other than perhaps margins and line spacing. On the other hand, word processing software was necessary for features like indexing and spell checking, features that are common in many applications today.

As computers and operating systems have become more powerful, vendors have sought to provide users with a single application platform that can meet all needs.

The key difference between electronic typesetting software and DTP software is that DTP software is generally interactive and WYSIWYG in design, while other electronic typesetting software requires the user to enter the processing program's markup language without immediate visualization of the finished product. 
This kind of workflow is less user-friendly than WYSIWYG, but more suitable for conference proceedings and scholarly articles as well as corporate newsletters or other applications where consistent, automated layout is important.

One of the early and comprehensive reference books on the art of Desktop Publishing is Desktop Publishing For Everyone by K.S.V. Menon. This publication deals with virtually every facet of publishing and nearly all tools available as at the time of the publishing of this book in the year 2000. It is currently out of print.

There is some overlap between desktop publishing and what is known as Hypermedia publishing (i.e. Web design, Kiosk, CD-ROM). Many graphical HTML editors such as Microsoft FrontPage and Adobe Dreamweaver use a layout engine similar to a DTP program. However, some Web designers still prefer to write HTML without the assistance of a WYSIWYG editor, for greater control and because these editors often result in code bloat.



Many books specialise in the details of particular software. These three teach the basics of page layout design on desktop systems.


Gene silencing

Gene silencing is a general term describing epigenetic processes of gene regulation. It is used to describe the "switching off" of a gene by a mechanism other than genetic engineering. That is, a gene which would be expressed ("turned on") under normal circumstances is switched off by machinery in the cell. When a gene is silenced, it means that its RNA is unable to make a protein.

Genes are regulated at either the transcriptional stage, or later, before translation. 

Transcriptional gene silencing is done by histone modifications, which put heterochromatin around a gene. This means the transcriptional machinery (RNA polymerase, transcription factors, etc.) cannot get at the gene. Genes may be silenced by DNA methylation. This happens regularly during development, when genes are turned on and off at different stages.

Post-transcriptional gene silencing is done by blocking or destroying the mRNA of a particular gene. The destruction of the mRNA prevents translation to form an active gene product (in most cases, a protein). A common way mRNA gets silenced is by RNAi. 

Both transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing are used to regulate genes. Methods of gene silencing also protect the organism's genome from transposons and viruses. Gene silencing thus may be part of an ancient immune system protecting cells from such infectious DNA and RNA.

Neurospora

Neurospora is a genus of Ascomycete fungi. The best known species in this genus is Neurospora crassa, a common model organism in genetics and molecular biology.

The first published account of this fungus was from an infestation of French bakeries in 1843.

"N. crassa" is used as a model organism because it is easy to grow and has a haploid life cycle that makes genetic analysis simple since recessive traits will show up in the offspring. Analysis of genetic recombination is facilitated by the ordered arrangement of the products of meiosis in "Neurospora" ascospores. Its entire genome of seven chromosomes has been sequenced.

"Neurospora" was used by Edward Tatum and George Wells Beadle in their experiments for which they won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1958. Beadle and Tatum exposed "N. crassa" to x-rays, causing mutations. They then observed failures in metabolic pathways caused by errors in specific enzymes. This led them to propose the "one gene, one enzyme" hypothesis that specific genes code for specific proteins. Their hypothesis was later elaborated to enzyme pathways by Norman Horowitz, also working on "Neurospora".

In the 24 April 2003 issue of "Nature", the genome of "N. crassa" was reported as completely sequenced. The genome is about 43 megabases long and includes approximately 10,000 genes. There is a project underway to produce strains containing knockout mutants of every "N. crassa" gene.

In its natural environment, "N. crassa" lives mainly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. It can be found growing on dead plant matter after fires. Neurospora is actively used in research around the world. It is important in the elucidation of molecular events involved in circadian rhythms, epigenetics and gene silencing, cell polarity, cell fusion, development, as well as many aspects of cell biology and biochemistry.

Strains and other materials for working with Neurospora are available from the

Rosemont, Illinois

Rosemont is a village in Illinois in the United States. It is near the O'Hare Airport, just northwest of Chicago. The Allstate Arena is in Rosemont.

Satellite television

Satellite television is a way of sending television signals. Television channels go to a ground station, which sends them by radio waves to a communications satellite in space. The satellite then transmits that signal back to earth. People with a satellite dish can receive the signals. Very often, satellite television is provided as a pay television service (especially to places where cable TV is not available). Here are some examples:

ITV Granada

ITV Granada was a television production company. It owned an ITV television channel of the same name. It produced a number of shows for many television stations (like Channel 4 and Sky). The company is now known as ITV Studios, which is owned by ITV plc. Granada's best known programme is the long-running soap opera Coronation Street. 

Heptachlor

Heptachlor is an insecticide. It was used against ants, termites, against mosquitos of the genus Anopheles, that can spread malaria and as a general pesticide. In humans, heptachlor damages the liver, and the central nervous system. It may cause cancer. It is sold as a powder. The Diels-Alder reaction is used to produce it. The compound is very stable and can stay in the environment for decades. 

Hepltachlor is one of the substances listed in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.

Magellan Telescopes

The Magellan Telescopes are two 6.5 meter diameter optical telescopes at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. The two were named after the Portuguese explorer, Ferdinand Magellan. Each telescope is also named; the Baade after astronomer Walter Baade, and the Clay after the philanthropist Landon T. Clay.

First light for the telescopes was on September 15, 2000 for the Baade, and September 7, 2002 for the Clay.

The Carnegie Institution for Science, University of Arizona, Harvard University, University of Michigan and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology worked together to build and operate the twin telescopes.

The Magellan Planet Search Program is looking for planets using a spectrograph mounted on the 6.5m Magellan II (Clay) telescope.


Las Campanas Observatory

Las Campanas Observatory is an astronomical observatory in the southern Atacama desert in Chile. It is owned and operated by the Carnegie Institution for Science. It was built in 1969 as the main observing site for the Carnegie Institution for Science. The headquarters are located in La Serena, Chile and the observatory is about northeast of the city. The observatory is at above sea level.

On February 24, 1987, Ian Shelton and Oscar Duhalde first saw the Supernova 1987A (SN 1987A).


There are also the small "Pi of the sky" wide-angle cameras that filmed the gamma ray burst GRB 080319B in 2008. This was the largest explosion ever seen in the Universe, and could have been seen without a telescope.


Tyler Perry

Tyler Perry (born September 13, 1969 in New Orleans) is an American actor, director, producer, and screenwriter, whose work plays are usually for encouragement to African Americans. Having started writing plays at age 18, Perry created a successful touring theater company, videos of whose performances were sold on DVD. As of March 2005, the plays had grossed over $75 million in ticket and DVD sales. He is well known for his plays on Madea. At age 16, he had his first name legally changed from Emmitt to Tyler in an effort to distance himself from his father. 


Be Easy

"Be Easy" is a song by Canadian-Lebanese singer Massari. The song peaked at number four on the Canadian Singles Chart, number 70 on the German Singles Chart and number 24 on the Portuguese Singles Chart. The song became the second single from "Massari" (2005). The music video won "Best Pop Video of the Year" at the 2006 MuchMusic Video Awards.

Smile for Me

"Smile for Me" is a song by Canadian-Lebanese singer Massari. The song was the lead single from "Massari" (2005).

Massari (album)

Massari () is the debut album by Canadian-Lebanese singer Massari. It was released in 2005. It was certified gold for selling 50,000 copies in Canada.

Spectrograph

A spectrograph is an instrument that breaks up a wave into a frequency spectrum. These could be sound, light or radio waves. For example the frequency spectrum of light is the brightness (intensity) and the amount of each colour. There are several kinds of machines called "spectrographs", used to look at different waves. The term was first used in 1884.

A spectrograph is closely related to a polychromator.

In astronomy, the first spectrographs used photographic paper as the detector. The star spectral classification and discovery of the main sequence, Hubble's law and the Hubble sequence were all made using photographic paper. The plant pigment phytochrome was discovered using a spectrograph that used living plants as the detector. New spectrographs use electronic detectors, such as CCDs which can be used for both visible and UV light. The type of detector depends on the wavelengths of light to be recorded.

An echelle spectrograph is a special machine which is able to break up light waves, with a high resolution and little interference. It does this by using very narrow slits which breaks light into beams, and then breaking up those beams again.



Ken Mogi

Mogi was born 20 October 1962 in Nakano Ward, Tokyo. His family soon moved to Kasukabe, Saitama where he grew up. He has an unusual hairstyle and cuts his own hair.

He graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1985 with a degree in science and in 1987 with a degree in law. Mogi earned his Ph.D. in 1992. His thesis was called "Mathematical Model of Muscle Contraction".

In 2009, Japan's National Tax Agency said that Mogi had broken tax laws. Mogi did not pay all of his taxes for three years. He tried to hide income of ¥400,000,000. NHK fired Mogi from a TV program because of his bad behavior.

Occupy Wall Street

Occupy Wall Street was a protest that started in 2011 in New York City and spread into other cities all over the United States. Citizens protested against how poor and wealthy people have lived in different ways and are treated differently by other people, and also against the way corporations used their money. People in New York started protesting in Zuccotti Park on September 17, and some people decided to camp there overnight. It grew to include several thousand people, with many different political views. Protesters included some communists, political moderates, liberals, conservatives, and libertarians.

Many of the Occupy protests in the rest of the country only started as in the middle of October. In some places, like Denver, Oakland, and New York City itself, police acted violently. In some places, including Miami, the protests were peaceful and some police officers supported the protests. After 2011 the numbers of people involved dwindled away. 

Thelma

Thelma [ thel-m"uh" ] is a female given name which in Greek means "will and volition". There are many celebrities going under this feminine name. Also, there are many television series featuring characters with the name "Thelma". In addition, a deadly tropical cyclone by the name "Thelma" struck the Philippines in latter 1991. This is a unique name (not in the top 1000 newborn names in the US in 2021).


First light (astronomy)

In astronomy, first light is the first time a telescope is used to look at the Universe. This is often not the first time the telescope has been used. Tests will have been done during daylight to make sure everything is working. Images taken during first light are not normally of scientific interest. They are usually poor quality as the parts of the telescope have not been properly adjusted for best performance. Usually, a well-known and spectacular astronomical object is chosen. First light is always a moment of great excitement, both for the people who designed and built the telescope, and for the astronomical community.

For example, the 200-inch Hale Telescope saw first light January 26, 1949, targeting a nebula located in the constellation Monoceros. under the direction of American astronomer Edwin Hubble. The image was published in many magazines. 

The Large Binocular Telescope had its first light with a single primary mirror on October 12, 2005. This was a view of NGC 891, a spiral galaxy in the Andromeda constellation . The second mirror was installed in January 2006 and the telescope became fully operational in January 2008. 

In physical cosmology, first light refers to the light coming from the first generation of hyperstars. These were formed less than a billion years after the big bang, bringing an end to the cosmological Dark Ages.

Esther Vergeer

Esther Mary Vergeer (born 18 July 1981, Woerden) is a Dutch wheelchair tennis player. Vergeer has not lost a match in singles since February 2003. She has won 39 Grand Slam titles, five Paralympic Gold Medals and 21 Masters titles. Vergeer has been the world number one since 1999. Vergeer is also a former wheelchair basketball player. She was part of the team which won the European Championships in 1997.

In March 1988 after a swimming lesson Vergeer became dizzy and passed out. Vergeer was just six years old at the time. Doctors found out that Vergeer was bleeding in her head. The bleeding had caused Vergeer to pass out. Vergeer had the blood removed. Six weeks later she went home. Yet the next year in June Vergeer had more headaches. She also had pressure behind the eyes and pain in her neck. The doctors could not find what was wrong. They sent her home. In October, doctors found Vergeer to be bleeding in her head again. They drained the blood. The doctors also found that Vergeer had an Vascular myelopathy. This abnormality caused the strokes that Vergeer experienced. On the 15 of January 1990, after a nine-hour operation Vergeer was unable to move her legs. The operation took place near to her spinal cord. Vergeer had one final operation in March but still could not move her legs.

Vergeer won her eleventh British Open singles title beating Griffieon in the final. Against Griffieon, Vergeer beat her for the forty ninth time. It was the first time that Vergeer had beaten her without losing a game. The tournament win was Vergeer's tenth US Open USTA Wheelchair tennis championships. Vergeer won her sixth U.S. Open by beating van Koot. Vergeer was good enough to reach both the singles and doubles events at the Masters.

Korie Homan

Korie Homan (born 16 June 1986, de Wijk) is a retired Dutch wheelchair tennis player. Homan was part of the current Paralympic doubles champion team. Homan is the former Australian Open Champion. She has won all the Grand Slam doubles titles. In 2009 she complete the Grand Slam with Esther Vergeer. In 2011 Homan retired from playing because of a wrist injury.

Homan was born to Jan and Gina Willem. Homan has two older sisters. At the age of 12 Homan was involved in a car accident. In 2003, when she finished school she had her leg cut off. 

Homan first appeared on the wheelchair tennis tour in 2003. By the end of the season she had reached number 23. Homan did not have a ranking at the start of the year. In 2004 at the age of 17 Homan won her first Masters title. She won the doubles with Jiske Griffioen. At the 2005 US Open Homan reached her first Grand Slam finals. She reached both the singles and the doubles final. In the singles she lost in straight sets to Vergeer. But she won the doubles with Vergeer. In 2006 Homan won her first two series one titles. She won both the singles and doubles titles in Livorno. Homan also reached her second Grand Slam doubles final. At the US Open Maaike Smit was her team mate. They lost in straight sets to Vergeer and Griffioen. The pair also lost the final of the Masters. Homan started 2007 by losing in the final of the Australian Open doubles. Her partner in the event was Florence Gravellier. They lost the final in a match tiebreaker. At the US Open Homan was joined by Sharon Walraven. The pair reached the final before losing. Homan also had final defeats at the Super Series events of the British, Japan and US Opens. Homan lost both finals at the Masters. In 2008 Homan lost both the singles and doubles finals at the Australian and French Opens. She also lost in the singles final at the Masters. At the Paralympic Games Homan won a Gold Medal in the doubles event. She also won a silver medal in the singles. In the final she became the first player in over five years to hold match point against Vergeer. Homan's last competition was the 2010 Australian Open. In July 2011 Homan said that she had retired because of a wrist injury.

Homan has a degree in biomedical science. As of September 2010, she is studying Veterinary Medicine.


Party realignment in the United States

A party realignment in the United States is when the country changes from being mostly run by one political party to mostly run by another political party. Some groups of people who used to vote for one party vote for the other one. Sometimes, political parties end and new ones begin. Party realignments can happen because of important events in history or because of changes in the kinds of people in the country. 

In the early 1800s, America had the "First Party System" with the Federalist Party and Democratic-Republican Party. When James Monroe was elected President of the United States, the Federalists died out. There was an "Era of Good Feelings" of one-party rule by the Democratic-Republicans. In the United States presidential election, 1824, four different men ran for President, all as Democratic-Republicans. John Quincy Adams was elected. 

After the election, Andrew Jackson formed a new party called the Democrats. Jackson's party was strongest in the South and West, and in some cities (at this time, only a few Americans lived in cities). Soon after Jackson's election, another party formed around supporters of Adams and Henry Clay. It was first called the National Republican Party, and later the Whig Party. The Whigs were strong in the North, and among the middle class and businessmen. The system of Democrats and Whigs is called the "Second Party System."

After the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the "Second Party System" ended: 


America went from being mostly Republican in the 1920s to mostly Democratic in the 1930s. This was due to America becoming much more urban, and the Great Depression. Franklin D. Roosevelt formed a coalition that would mostly last until 1964 called the "." 


In the 1960s and 70s, the New Deal coalition fell apart. This was due to the Civil Rights Movement, Roe v. Wade, Vietnam War and the suburbanization of America. 

What changed:






Krishna

Krishna is an important God (Param Brahma) in Hinduism. He is considered to have been an avatar of Vishnu. Krishna is believed to have been a real being who took part in the war known as the Mahabharata. He is a central character in the important Hindu scripture the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna belonged to a nomadic tribe of Abhiras known as Sāttvatas who inhabited the country (Surasena Janapad) near Mathura. These "Sāttvatas" or more properly the Yadavas of whom they were a branch were mentioned by Panini. Hindu often consider him a warrior, hero, teacher and philosopher and a great leader. He defeated the cruel Abhira King Kansa, who putted his mother, "Devāki" and her consort "Vasudevā" to jail.

Rotating furnace

A rotating furnace is a special type of furnace used to make lenses or mirrors for telescopes. Glass is placed in the furnace which is then spun up and heated. The top surface of the melted glass takes on a concave shape. The glass is cooled while still spinning. The spinning makes the glass the same shape as the main mirror used in a telescope. Computer controlled grinding machines can correct the shape of the glass. The concave top surface can be coated with silver and be used as a focusing mirror. The shape of bottom surface is made by the container the glass was melted in. The technology is being used for the Giant Magellan Telescope's seven mirrors. 

Large focusing mirrors can also be made using liquid mercury, such as the Large Zenith Telescope. The rotation is continuous and the metal remains liquid; once all waves and imbalances die out, the telescope is then used. 

Dependent and independent variables

In an experiment, the parts being studied can be classed as either dependent or independent variables. The "dependent" variable is the possible outcome of the experiment; the effect. It depends on what happens to other variables in the experiment. The dependent variable is basically the part that you are changing. For example, if you want to know how much light a plant needs to grow, the amount of growth is the dependent. If you wanted to see if a plant would grow better in hot or cold areas your independent variable would be the temperature of the air.

The "independent" variable is the variable that you have control over, what you can choose and manipulate. It is usually what you think will affect the dependent variable. In some cases, you may not be able to manipulate the independent variable. It may be something that is already there and is fixed, something you would like to evaluate with respect to how it affects something else, the independent variable like color, kind, time. As an example, you are interested in how stress affects heart rate in humans. Your independent variable would be the stress and the dependent variable would be the heart rate. You can directly manipulate stress levels in your human subjects and measure how those stress levels change heart rate.

In mathematics, the dependent variable changes with the independent variable, hence the name (it depends on the independent variable).

In calculus, a function is a map whose action is specified on variables. Take "x" and "y" to be two variables. A function "f" may map "x" to some expression in "x". Assigning gives a relation between "y" and "x". If there is some relation specifying "y" in terms of "x", then y is known as a dependent variable (and "x" is an independent variable).
A dependent variable is also known as a "response variable", "regressand", "measured variable", "responding variable", "explained variable", "outcome variable", "experimental variable", and "output variable".
If the independent variable is referred to as an "explanatory variable" then the term "response variable" is preferred by some authors for the dependent variable.

Hamnet Shakespeare

Hamnet Shakespeare ( January 1585 
9 August 1596) was the only son of William Shakespeare and Anne Hathaway. He was the twin brother of Judith Shakespeare. He died at age 11. How he died is not known. There are several ideas about a possible relationship between Hamnet and his father's play "Hamlet". Other ideas state there is a relationship between Hamnet's death and the writing of "King John", "Romeo and Juliet", "Julius Caesar", and "Twelfth Night". These ideas of a relationship became popular as early as the 18th century. They continued into the 1930s. In the 1930s, thinkers who believed in modernism and New Criticism said the relationship did not matter. Modernism and New Criticism thinkers believe that a writer's life does not change his writing. More recently, as New Criticism has become less popular, the ideas about Hamnet and his father's work have been talked about again.

Hamnet was born along his twin sister Judith Shakespeare in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1585, as the son and daughter of William Shakespeare, a English playwright. The exact date of their births is unknown, but they were presumed to have been born sometime in January 1585. Hamnet Shakespeare died in Stratford-upon-Avon in August 1596. The exact date of his death is unknown, but is presumed to have been on 9 August 1596.

Large Zenith Telescope

The Large Zenith Telescope (LZT) is a 6.0 metre diameter telescope. It is in the University of British Columbia's Malcolm Knapp Research Forest, about east of Vancouver. It is one of the largest telescopes in the world. 

A zenith telescope is only able to look straight up. This means that it can use a mirror which is a smoothly spinning pan filled with liquid mercury. The LZT uses 28 litres of mercury, spinning once every 8.5 seconds. This type of mirror can be made much larger and cheaper than a conventional mirror, which means it collects much more light. This light is focused into a CCD to make an image. The LZT is used for "transit imaging". This means that earth's rotation moves stars past the telescope. Images can be taken by moving the sensor electronically in step with this movement.

The telescope was made in 1994 using parts from the three-metre diameter NASA Orbital Debris Observatory telescope, which was retired a couple years earlier after several years of use.

First Battle of Maryang San

The Battle of Maryang San was Australia's greatest accomplishment in the Korean War. The battle occurred when the US General George Fleet called for forces to capture some positions just before the signing of the truce at Panmanjan.

The Commonwealth forces, fighting as part of the United Nations were British, Australian and New Zealand units. These included three Battalions of the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade, the 1st Battalion The King's Own Scottish Borderers, 1st Battalion King's Shropshire Light Infantry and 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. Brigadier George Taylor (United Kingdom) was the Brigade Commander. The British Commonwealth Division had the 25th, 28th and 29th Brigades under the command of Lieutenant General James "Gentleman Jim" Cassels (later Field Marshal Sir James) and was part of 1 Corps. These units were against the Chinese Communist forces. 3 Battalion RAR was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel 'Frank' Francis Hassett. Commonwealth forces main aims were to take a number of hill positions, and the main objective, Maryang San.

The first attacks saw the Australian A and B company of 3 RAR take Hill 199, and the 1st Battalion Kings Shropshire Light Infantry take Hill 208. The Kings Own Scottish Borderers had moved to take Hill 399 but were pinned down on its slopes by night time. The Australians attacked at dawn, moving against the Chinese held Hill 200. Chinese infantry were driven from their trenches, and they fled, leaving behind some prisoners of war. The first gun emplacement was taken, and then the second, with the Chinese troops retreating down the slope of Hill 200.

A, B and D Companies attacked the Chinese units, and drew them away from Maryan San, the main objective. Following United Nations forces artillery and mortar fire, Chinese troops withdrew from Maryan San, and the Australian troops moved to take the position. Australian troops moved against an area that was used by the Chinese for artillery bombardments, known as the Hinge. After taking the Hinge, they were subjected to constant attacks, which eventually became sporadic and died off. At about 8 pm, the Chinese launched an attack in huge numbers. The Australian units were well dug in, using the Chinese own trench positions, and responded to the waves of Chinese troops with machine gun fire. Chinese troops fell in their hundreds. South Korean porters moved forward constantly, bringing supplies and taking away wounded.

By 5 November, after the Australians were withdrawn to recover, Maryang San had been recaptured by the Chinese. It was a terrible blow to morale for those who had fought long and hard to capture it. The tactically important ground of Maryang San remained in the hands of Chinese forces for the rest of the war.

Fugacity

In thermodynamics, the fugacity is a state function of any isothermal system. The fugacity, which has units of pressure, represents the tendency of a fluid to escape or expand isothermally. For gases at low pressures where the ideal gas law holds, fugacity is equal to pressure. The ratio formula_1 between fugacity formula_2 and pressure formula_3 is called the fugacity coefficient; therefore, formula_4 for an ideal gas.

The fugacity formula_5 is defined at fixed temperature formula_6 by the following differential relation:

Gerund

A gerund is a verb used as a noun. 

In English, the gerund is formed by adding -ing to a verb root. It is identical in form to the present participle (ending in "-ing") and can behave as a verb within a clause (so that it may be modified by an adverb or have an object), but the clause as a whole (sometimes consisting of only one word, the gerund itself) acts as a noun within the larger sentence. For example: "Eating this cake is easy."

In "Eating this cake is easy", "eating this cake", although traditionally known as a phrase, is referred to as a non-finite clause in modern linguistics. "Eating" is the verb in the clause, while "this cake" is the object of the verb. "Eating this cake" acts as a noun phrase within the sentence as a whole, though; the subject of the sentence is the non-finite clause, specifically "eating".

Other examples of the gerund:

Not all nouns that are identical in form to the present participle are gerunds. The formal distinction is that a gerund is a "verbal" noun – a noun derived from a verb that retains verb characteristics, that functions "simultaneously" as a noun and a verb, while other nouns in the form of the present participle (ending in "-ing") are "de"verbal nouns, which function as common nouns, not as verbs at all. Compare:

As the result of its origin and development, the gerund has nominal and verbal properties. The "nominal" characteristics of the gerund are as follows:
The "verbal" characteristics of the gerund include the following:

Verbs that are often followed by a gerund include "admit, adore, anticipate, appreciate, avoid, carry on, consider, contemplate, delay, deny, describe, detest, dislike, enjoy, escape, fancy, feel, finish, give, hear, imagine, include, justify, listen to, mention, mind, miss, notice, observe, perceive, postpone, practice, quit, recall, report, resent, resume, risk, see, sense, sleep, stop, suggest, tolerate" and "watch".
Additionally, prepositions are often followed by a gerund.

For example:

Institution of Electrical Engineers

The Institution of Electrical Engineers (I.E.E., pronounced "I-double-E" or "I-E-E") was a British professional organisation of electronics, electrical, manufacturing, and Information Technology professionals. It focused on electrical engineers. The I.E.E. was founded in 1871 as the Society of Telegraph Engineers. It changed its name in 1880 to the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Electricians. The name changed again to the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1889. It was Incorporated by a Royal Charter in 1921. In 2006, the I.E.E. merged with the Institution of Incorporated Engineers (I.I.E.) to form the Institution of Engineering and Technology (I.E.T.). Before the merger, the I.E.E. was the largest professional engineering society in Europe, with a worldwide membership of around 120,000.

Participle

In linguistics, a participle is a word that shares some characteristics of both verbs and adjectives. Examples of participle formation are:

As noun-modifiers, participles usually precede the noun (like adjectives), but in many cases they can or must follow it:

The present participle in English has the same form as the gerund, but the gerund acts as a noun rather than a verb or a modifier. The word "sleeping" in "Your job description does not include sleeping" is a gerund and not a present participle.

While English past participles, like past tense forms, are sometimes irregular, all English present participles are regular, being formed with the suffix "-ing".
The present participle in English is in the active voice and is used for: 

The past participle may be used in both active and passive voices:

Passive participles reflect past action in the passive voice, for example
Even irregular past participle verbs often follow the format "-en" or "-ne", as may be seen from above. For examples:

Diary of a Mad Black Woman

With no place to go, Helen goes to live with her grandmother Mabel "Madea" Simmons (Tyler Perry) in the ghetto. Madea assists Helen in getting her life back under control with the help of Helen's mother Myrtle Jean (Cicely Tyson), Madea's brother Joe (Tyler Perry), and Brian (Tyler Perry), her attorney relative.



Crash Bandicoot (video game)

Crash Bandicoot is a platform game made by Naughty Dog in 1996 for the PlayStation, featuring the character by the same name. In it, Crash must fight Dr. Neo Cortex's henchmen (bosses) in order to save Tawna, his beloved bandicoot girlfriend for revenge on Cortex. The game sold 6.8 million copies, becoming the 8th best-selling PlayStation video games of all time.

"Crash Bandicoot" has 33 levels. Two of these levels can be activated by collecting a key. Each level has a particular theme. No theme is shared by more than two levels. For example, on two levels, Crash runs toward the camera from a boulder (that is heading towards him), an allusion to Indiana Jones. On another level, henchmen throw barrels of toxic waste at Crash as he progresses toward the level's goal. There are also unlockable bonus levels by collecting three "Nitrus Brio", "Dr. Cortex" (only in 2 levels) and "Tawna" icons. These pictures are always in boxes which gives the player a reason to break open boxes since you can't save your progress unless you complete a Tawna bonus round or a Cortex bonus round. You can also save by collecting a gem.

You can also collect gems in Crash Bandicoot. To collect a gem, you must break all the boxes on that level without losing a life. There are several different colored gems in the game. Some levels require that you complete another level before every box on a certain level is revealed. For example, the Jungle Rollers level requires that you collect the green gem from the Lost City level before every box on that level is unmasked.

The boss levels feature the following characters, in order of appearance:

J Balvin

José Álvaro Osorio Balvin known professionally as "J Balvin" is a Colombian singer.

Balvin was born in a middle-class family in Medellín, Colombia, on May 7, 1985. He is the son of José Álvaro Osorio and Alba Mery Balvin. Balvin has a younger sister named Carolina, who is a model. His father was an economist and businessman and grew up in a large house in the hills outside the city. He grew up listening to rock bands like Metallica and Nirvana. He claims that he incorporates grunge aesthetics into his personal style by having a Nirvana tattoo on his knee. He developed an interest in reggaeton after listening to Daddy Yankee. He recalls that "I was such a fan that I copied his style, the way he moved on stage, his flows, his raps," comparing him to reggaeton's Jay-Z. His father's business went bankrupt and his family lost their homes and cars, demanding that the family move to a poorer neighborhood. During this period of his life, J Balvin observes: "When I went into the favela, people saw me as a rich person, but when I'm around rich people, they see me as someone from the ghetto. They are all perceptions. I like to move between the worlds. I feel equally comfortable in both.".

When J Balvin was 17, he attended an English exchange program in Oklahoma. He was disappointed by the experience, saying, "I was expecting the US that everyone knows about Hollywood." Shortly after the experience, he moved to New York to study English and music, living with an aunt in Staten Island and working as a dog walker. During his time in New York, he was fascinated by the business knowledge of rappers 50 Cent and P. Diddy of New York. J Balvin worked in various jobs in New York, Miami and Medellin, including working illegally in the United States as a carpenter and house painter. He finally decided to return to Colombia and began performing at various urban clubs in Medellín and increasing his social media afterwards. He enrolled at the prestigious EAFIT University in Medellin for seven semesters studying international business. At 19, he began to pursue a career in music and adopted the stage name J Balvin "El Negocio", meaning "the Business" in Portuguese.

He met his DJ and business partner David Rivera Mazo in a freestyle rap battle in Medellin. The two became friends and began producing and promoting their own music without a record label. The first songs by J Balvin were described as "basically poor imitations of Puerto Rican commercial reggaeton." He soon adopted a more relaxed and minimalist style in his music. He signed with EMI Colombia in 2009 and soon afterwards released the single "Ella Me Cautivó", which was reached number 35 on the Billboard Tropical Songs chart. His first international success was the one-night " Yo Te Lo Dije". J Balvin signed with Universal's subsidiary Capitol Latin, a year later.

Empress Suiko

The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.

In the history of Japan, Suiko was the first of eight women to be empress. The seven others were: (a) Kōgyoku/Saimei, (b) Jitō, (c) Gemmei, (d) Genshō, (e) Kōken/Shōtoku, (f) Meishō, and (g) Go-Sakuramachi.

Suiko was the third daughter of Emperor Kimmei. She was the half-sister of Emperor Yōmei and Emperor Sushun.

Suiko was also a wife of Emperor Bidatsu.

When Suiko became empress, she ended a power struggle for the throne after the deaths of emperors who were her brothers.


Prince Shōtoku was the most important man in Suko's court.

In 599, an earthquake destroyed buildings in Yamato province which is now known as Nara Prefecture.

The reign of this empress was marked by the opening of relations with the Sui court in 600.

The use of the Sexegenary cycle calendar ("Jikkan Jūnishi") in Japan is credited to Empress Suiko in 604.


Suiko ruled for 35 years. She abdicated in 628.

Suiko died in 628. This empress' official name after her death (her posthumous name) was regularized only after death. Her reign name means "to reason from antiquity."

The actual site of Suiko's grave is known. This empress is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Osaka.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Suiko's mausoleum. It is formally named "Shinaga no Yamada no misasagi".


Berkshire Hathaway

Berkshire Hathaway is an investment company mostly owned and controlled by Warren Buffett. It owns many different companies. It owns several companies completely, and holds large portions of other companies. It has 27,000 shareholders, and Bill Gates is one of the company's directors.

It takes its name from a textile mill that was started in 1839, bought by Buffett in 1964, and closed in 1985.

Since Berkshire Hathaway's stock has gained a lot of value and never split, a single share of "A stock" is now worth over $400,000. Because of this, there is a "B" stock that sells for a small fraction of the "A stock".


Battle of Valcour Island

The naval Battle of Valcour Island took place on October 11, 1776 on Lake Champlain. The battle was also known as the Battle of Valcour Bay. The main battle had took place in Valcour Bay, a strait between the New York mainland and Valcour Island. The battle was known as one of the first naval battles of the American Revolutionary War. It was also known as one of the first battle from the Royal Navy. Benedict Arnold demanded that the Americans flee from their ships. The ships were destroyed by a British force, which was controlled by General Guy Charleton. The British had planned to reach the upper Hudson River valley, however the American defense of Lake Champlain stalled the British from reaching it.

In June 1776, The Continental Army had moved away from enemy forces in Quebec to Fort Ticonderoga and Fort Crown Point. They had spent that summer fixing their forts and building more ships to build their army. General Carleton had a 9,000 man army at Fot Saint-Jean. However, he needed to build an object to carry all of them over the lake. The Americans had either taken or destroyed most of the ships on the lake.

On October 11, Arnold took the British vessels to a different location. He had chosen to give the British limited advantages. Many American ships were damaged or destroyed during the battle. Arnold had took the American vessels past the British vessels during that night. He had took them toward Crown Point and Ticonderoga. However, because of dangerous weather, more of the vessels were captured or burned before they had reached Crown Point. When Arnold had reached Crown Point he had the fort's buildings burned. He then left to Ticonderoga.

Thomas Pringle, James Dacres, Edward Pellew and John Schank, who were officers, had became admirals in the Royal Navy. Valcour Bay, where the battle had begun, is now a National Historic Landmark. The USS "Philadelphia", which had sank after the battle on October 11, was risen from the ocean in 1934. USS "Spitfire", which was located in 1997, is on the National Register of Historic Places.


Valcour Bay

Valcour Bay is a strait between the New York mainland and Valcour Island. It is four miles south from Plattsburgh, New York. The bay was where the Battle of Valcour Island had happened during the American Revolutionary War. On October 11, 1776, the presence of an American fleet on the west shore of Lake Champlain, at Valcour Bay, hampered the British and allowed an American victory at Saratoga a year later, a turning point in the Revolutionary War. In 1961 Valcour Bay was declared a National Historic Landmark.

Valcour Island

Valcour Island lies in Lake Champlain, forming a strait against the New York mainland. On October 11, 1776, a naval engagement known as the Battle of Valcour Island was fought in that strait between British and United States naval forces.


Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester

Sir Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester (1724-1808) was a British soldier and Governor of Canada. Colonel Carleton was a part of James Wolfe's attack on Quebec City during the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. General Carleton repelled the American attack on Quebec in 1775. He was governor of Canada twice, 1768-1778 and 1785-1795.

TBS (American TV channel)

TBS (Turner Broadcasting System) is an American cable TV network that shows sports and variety programming. TBS is well known for its broadcasts of the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball team and various National Basketball Association games. TBS also shows reruns of popular network television shows from the past.

During the 1980s, WTBS focused heavily on movies – running two films during the day, and a movie-exclusive schedule during the nighttime hours after 8:00 p.m., with the exception of sports events. At other times, WTBS continued to run mostly classic sitcoms, and vintage cartoons. In 1986, when Ted Turner purchased Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer/United Artists (which he would sell back to previous owner Kirk Kerkorian that October due to debt incurred by the Turner Broadcasting System from its purchase of the film studio), WTBS gained the rights to the entire MGM film library (including certain acquisitions by MGM). This gave WTBS the rights to air many theatrical cartoon shorts such as "Tom & Jerry", "Barney Bear", "Tex Avery", and "The Pink Panther", as well as shows like "Gilligan's Island" and "CHiPs".

Along with "Tom & Jerry", WTBS began to run "The Little Rascals", "Looney Tunes"/"Merrie Melodies" cartoons released prior to August 1948, theatrical "Popeye" cartoon shorts, and "Three Stooges" shorts under the banner "Tom & Jerry and Friends" running for either one hour or 90 minutes during the morning hours and for an hour in the afternoon from 1986 until the mid-1990s. In the late 1980s, WTBS decreased the number of movies broadcast during the day slightly and began to add sitcoms from the 1970s (such as "Happy Days", "The Jeffersons", "Good Times" and "One Day at a Time") to the evening lineup; "Little House on the Prairie" aired during the late mornings continuously from 1986 to 2003.



Good Luck Charlie

Good Luck Charlie is an American sitcom. It was created by Phil Baker and Drew Vaupen. They wanted to create a program that would appeal to entire families, not just children. Production began in August 2009. The show premiered on Disney Channel in the United States on April 4, 2010. It premiered in Canada on April 5, 2010. It premiered in the United Kingdom and Ireland on May 14, 2010. It premiered in Colorado america on July 23, 2010. In March 2011, a feature-length Christmas Disney Channel Original Movie based on the series, entitled "Good Luck Charlie, It's Christmas!", began production for a December 2011 premiere. In June 2013, Disney Channel announced that the series would end its run after four seasons. The finale aired on February 16, 2014, with a one-hour episode.

The show is about the Duncan family, which is made up of Teddy, PJ, Gabe, Bob, Amy and Charlie Duncan. In each episode, Teddy records a video diary about her everyday life; it also gives advice to Charlie for when she grows up. At the end of the diary Teddy states the show's name ("Good Luck Charlie") after a problem or situation happens or is solved. However, the original idea of "Good Luck Charlie" was "Love Teddy".


An Indian adaptation of the show titled "Best of Luck Nikki", premiered on Disney Channel India on April 3, 2011. Sheena Bajaj plays Dolly Singh, a character similar to that of Teddy Duncan, Ananya Kolvankar portrays Nikita "Nikki" Singh, a character similar to that of Charlie and Gurdeep Kohli portrays Himani Singh, a character similar to that of Amy. The series ran successfully for 4 seasons, 104 episodes and 3 special episodes and ended on April 16, 2016.

A Pakistani adaptation of the show titled "Peek-A-Boo Shahwaiz" premiered on Play Entertainment from 15 July 2018.


Shake It Up (American TV series)

Shake It Up! is a Disney Channel original series starring Bella Thorne, Zendaya Coleman, and Roshon Fegan. The show is in a show-within-a-show format. It premiered on November 7, 2010. In 2011, Disney Channel confirmed that a movie based on the show is currently being produced.

Two best friends (CeCe Jones and Rocky Blue) land a job as background dancers in a show, "Shake It Up! Chicago" thanks to their friend Deuce. The show follows their adventures in the show and features problems and issues such as; their new social status, rivals on the show, and even the ultimate test: the strength of their friendship.




In 2013, an Indian adaptation of the show with the same name was made. It premiered on Disney Channel India on March 30, 2013. However, it is centered on two teenage boys as opposed to two teenage girls. Like most Indian adaptations, the episodes are similar to the original. The series ran for one season only.


Indian Camp

"Indian Camp" is a short story written by Ernest Hemingway.

Nick Adams goes with his father, a doctor, to an Indian camp. A pregnant woman is having difficulty giving birth. The baby is found to be backwards in the womb, and Dr. Adams is forced to perform a Caesarean operation. After the procedure is successful, Nick's father looks on the top bunk of the bed to see if the woman's husband was okay. The man had committed suicide with a razor during the labor. 

This is the first Nick Adams story and shows the characterization of the father/son relationship between Nick and Dr. Adams.


Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)

"Help Wanted" is the pilot episode of SpongeBob SquarePants. It is the first episode of the first season. It first aired on May 1, 1999.

SpongeBob gets ready to apply for a job at the Krusty Krab. He is encouraged by his best friend, a starfish named Patrick. When he arrives, he asks a crab named Mr. Krabs to start working. SpongeBob's neighbor, an octopus named Squidward, does not want SpongeBob to get a job. Mr. Krabs agrees to hire him if he gets a special spatula. As SpongeBob looks for it, a lot of anchovies appear at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob returns with his spatula and cooks hamburgers for them. He is then hired by Mr. Krabs.

Magellanic Clouds

The Magellanic Clouds are two irregular, dwarf galaxies. They do not have a regular shape, and only have a few billion stars. The Magellanic Clouds can only be seen from the southern hemisphere. They orbit the Milky Way galaxy. They, along with the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy, are part of the Local Group of over 50 galaxies. The two clouds are known as the:


The first written record of the Magellanic Clouds was by the Persian astronomer Al Sufi. In 964 he wrote the "Book of Fixed Stars". He called the Large Magellanic Cloud "al-Bakr" (the Sheep) "of the southern Arabs". He wrote that the Cloud could not be seen from northern Arabia and Baghdad, but could be seen at the strait of Bab el Mandeb (12°15' N). This is the southernmost point of Arabia.

The first Europeans to see the Clouds were Italian explorers Peter Martyr d'Anghiera and Andrea Corsali at the end of the 15th century. Antonio Pigafetta also saw them, when he went with Ferdinand Magellan on his circumnavigation of the world in 1519-1522. However, naming the clouds after Magellan did not become widespread until much later. In Bayer's 1661 book, "Uranometria", they are called "nubecula major" and "nubecula minor". In the 1756 star map by French astronomer Lacaille, they are called "le Grand Nuage" and "le Petit Nuage" ("the Large Cloud" and "the Small Cloud").

The Clouds can be easily seen without the use of a telescope. They look like separate pieces of the Milky Way. About 21° apart in the night sky, the real distance between them is about 75,000 light-years. They were long thought to be the closest galaxies to the Milky Way. The Canis Major Galaxy, discovered in 2003, is now thought to be our closest galaxy.

The LMC is about 160,000 light years away, while the SMC is about 200,000. The LMC is about 14,000 light years in diameter, and the SMC about 7,000. For comparison, the Milky Way is about 170,000-200,000 light years across.

Scientists believe that the irregular galaxy shape of Magellanic Clouds is caused by tidal interaction with the Milky Way as they travel close to it. Streams of neutral hydrogen connect them to the Milky Way and to each other. Both Clouds look like they were once spiral in shape. Their gravity has affected the Milky Way as well, distorting the outer parts of the galaxy's disc shape.

They have a different structure and lower mass than our galaxy. There are two other big differences. First, they are gas-rich; they have more hydrogen and helium compared to the Milky Way. They are also more metal-poor than the Milky Way. The youngest stars in the LMC and SMC have less than half the amount of other elements. Both are noted for their nebulae and larger numbers of young stars. Like our own Galaxy their stars range from the very young to the very old, which shows the Clouds have a long history.

A supernova, SN 1987A, in the Large Magellanic Cloud was the brightest object seen from Earth in over four centuries.

In 2010, a French scientist said that the clouds may have been ejected from a collision that formed the Andromeda Galaxy six billion years ago. However most astronomers believe the Magellanic Clouds were made in the same process that formed our Milky Way Galaxy.

New research suggests that the SMC may in fact be split in two. A smaller part may hidden about 30,000 light years behind the SMC. This could have happened with the LMC splitting the SMC, and that the two sections are still moving apart. This smaller section is being called the Mini Magellanic Cloud.



Christmas Who?

"Christmas Who?" (also known as "The SpongeBob Christmas Special") is the 28 episode of the second season of "SpongeBob SquarePants". The special received positive feedback. A reviewer on Reviewstream.com calls it "a great story of the holiday spirit". The special currently ranks a high 9.1 out of 10 on TV.com.

SpongeBob is sneaking up to Sandy's tree dome to perform his new karate move, and sees Sandy lighting up her tree to look like a Christmas tree. SpongeBob, mistaking the lights for fire, freaks out and runs in and splashes water on Sandy. Sandy realizes that SpongeBob never seen a Christmas tree before, and does not know what the holiday is. While learning of the holiday and its activities, SpongeBob begins to spread the joy throughout the city of Bikini Bottom. He tells everyone that Santa Claus will give you presents if you write him letters.

While everyone decorates and writes letters to Santa, Squidward refuses to believe in Santa and all the Christmas cheer. On Christmas Eve, everyone waits outside singing for Santa, while Squidward goes to sleep. The next morning, it turns out Santa never came, and soon, everyone becomes angry with SpongeBob. After everyone has left, SpongeBob becomes heartbroken. His pain is only made worse when Squidward comes out and makes fun of him. SpongeBob gives Squidward a present that he would have given him so he would not feel left out if Santa came. Squidward unwraps the present to find a carved wooden clarinet, hand-made by SpongeBob. He becomes very happy, and becomes regretful of his actions. 

When SpongeBob begins taking the lights off of his home, Squidward soon appears dressed as Santa Claus. Santa informs SpongeBob that he brought the holiday to Bikini Bottom by just spreading the word, which makes SpongeBob faint. Squidward gives all the fish his belongings to make SpongeBob and the people happy.

When it's all over, Squidward has nothing left and takes off the suit. SpongeBob then tells him everything he missed. That's when Squidward finds a note at his doorstep from Santa. Squidward then looks up to see the real Santa in his sleigh flying out of Bikini Bottom, laughing with joy. 

Graveyard Shift

"Graveyard Shift" is the 36th episode of the second season of "SpongeBob SquarePants". Reviewstream had given a positive feedback, stating that it is a "funny episode," although stating that "it might frighten younger viewers." A DVD Verdict critic also stated the episode to be one of his favorites, stating that it had a "funny dialogue." DVD Talk also gave a positive score.

The Krusty Krab closes, and Squidward is excited, but Mr. Krabs realizes that more profit would be gained if it was open 24 hours a day, so he does that. SpongeBob is really excited, while Squidward is extremely annoyed. Squidward scares SpongeBob with tales of the hash-slinging slasher. According to Squidward, he was a fry cook at the Krusty Krab many years ago. When he was making Krabby Patties, he accidentally cut off his own hand, and later replaced it with a rusty spatula. He was run over by a bus and fired at his funeral. Every Tuesday night, his ghost comes to the place and haunts it.

There are three signs of his arrival, which are:
Later that night, everything that Squidward says actually happens. He and SpongeBob are really scared until they find out that the so-called hash-slinging slasher is actually a person who wants a job application, and hung up on the phone because he was nervous.

Sailor Mouth

"Sailor Mouth" is the 38th episode of the second season of "SpongeBob SquarePants". The episode was watched by 8.7 million viewers. Erik Wiese, a member of the "SpongeBob SquarePants" crew, stated that "Sailor Mouth" was one of his favorite episodes because of its random and satirical nature, saying "Sometimes SpongeBob just catches me off-guard."

SpongeBob and Patrick discover a swear word written on the Krusty Krab dumpster. Although SpongeBob is unsure of its meaning, Patrick tells him that it is a 'sentence enhancer' that will make them sound "fancy". The two repeat the word while being in the Krusty Krab. They also repeat the word over the loudspeaker. However, the two regret saying it after Mr. Krabs had spoken to them about the word being highly inappropriate. They are told that the curse word is number eleven in a list of thirteen bad words in total. Later, SpongeBob loses a game to Patrick and says the word again. SpongeBob and Patrick race to the Krusty Krab to tell Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs is mad and punishes them by having them paint the Krusty Krab building. When Mr. Krabs trips on a rock he screams all 13 bad words. 

SpongeBob and Patrick, followed by Mr. Krabs, rush to Mama Krabs' house to tell on Mr. Krabs. All three begin tattling on one another to Mama Krabs. Mama Krabs, overwhelmed by the bad words, faints and then falls to the ground. After regaining consciousness, Mama Krabs then puts all three to work painting her house. While watching them paint, Mama Krabs hurts herself and begins yelling out in pain. The three look at Mama Krabs in shock, thinking that she is using one of the swear words. However, they all begin to laugh when they discover that a neighbor was honking the horn of his old jalopy, which happened to always occur exactly with her outburst.

Trinomial nomenclature

In biology, trinomial nomenclature is used to name living things at a rank lower than species. The term "trinomial nomenclature" means "three-part name" or "system of three-part names". 

If living things are divided into more categories than species such as a sub species then it gets a three part scientific name. The first part indicates the genus, the second part indicates the species, and the third part is particular to the living thing (at whatever rank it has been assigned).

Siberian crane

The Siberian crane ("Grus leucogeranus") or Siberian white crane or snow crane, is a critically endangered crane. They occur in three groups: the eastern group, which migrates from eastern Siberia to China, the central group, which migrates from western Siberia to India, and the western group, which migrate from western Russia to Iran

Adult Siberian cranes are 140 cm (5 ft) tall and weight 6 kg (13 lbs). Their plumage is pure white, except for some wing feathers, which are black. The front of the face does not have any feathers and is reddish in color.

The eastern group is abiut 3000-4000 cranes, over 95% of the total population. In 2008, 3750 individuals were counted at Poyang Lake in China, one of the breeding sites. This group of cranes breeds in the Yakutia region of northeastern Siberia and spends the winter in the Yangtze River valley. However, cranes sometimes are found in areas like Mongolia, Japan, and Korea, although they do not breed there.

The central group is believed to breed in western Siberia, especially along the Ob River. These cranes spend the winter in India. Although no one has actually tracked a crane on its migration route, researchers believe the cranes in Siberia fly over Kazakhstan and Afghanistan to reach India's Keoladeo National Park. They believe this because cranes were seen in Kazakhstan and may have even nested there, and several cranes are known to stop in Afghanistan's lakes during their migration. However, cranes of the central group were last seen in 2002, and there were only four cranes. Therefore, this group may be extinct.

Suiko Seamount

The seamount is also known as the "Suiko Guyot" because it has a flat top. This undersea geologic feature is also called a "guyot" or "tablemount".

This seabed mountain is named after Empress Suiko of Japan.

The last eruption from Suiko seamount was 60 million years ago.

Light machine gun

A light machine gun, or LMG, is a type of machine gun that is designed to be used by only one soldier. Light machine guns are often used as squad automatic weapons.

The caliber of cartridge that modern light machine guns fire are usually less than medium machine guns. They are also usually lighter. However, a light machine gun can be noticed by the role it plays in a battle. Some machine guns, such as general-purpose machine guns, can be used as either a light machine gun or a medium machine gun. If it uses a bipod and fires in short bursts, it is a light machine gun. If it is used on a tripod and fires automatically for a long time, it is a medium machine gun.

It is possible to fire a light machine gun from the hip, or on the move. This pins down the enemy. Marching fire relies on this. Otherwise, light machine guns are usually fired while lying down and using a bipod. 

Many light machine guns (such as the Bren gun or the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle) got their ammunition from a magazine. Others, such as the MG 34, could get their ammunition from either a belt or a magazine. Modern light machine guns are designed to fire more bullets that have a smaller caliber. Because of this, they are usually belt-fed.

Light machine guns were first brought into service in World War I to make the infantry more powerful. By the end of World War II, one light machine gun was given to a section or squad. 

Two examples of light machine guns are:


Meiji Seamount

The seamount is also known as "Meiji Guyot" because it has a flat top. This undersea geologic feature is also called a "guyot" or "tablemount".

This seabed mountain is named after Emperor Meiji of Japan.

The last eruption from Meiji seamount was 62 million years ago.

Minister Mentor

Minister Mentor (, ) is a Singapore cabinet position created in 2004 as part of a change in Singapore's political leadership. The reason the government gave for creating this job is that Lee Kuan Yew can still help and advise the government.

The newly appointed Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong (son of Lee Kuan Yew and the next prime minister after Goh Chok Tong), announced Lee Kuan Yew's new together with the naming of his Cabinet on August 12, 2004. Before being appointed as Minister Mentor, Lee Kuan Yew held the post of Senior Minister (1990–2004) in the Cabinet of then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. This role of Minister Mentor was considered by some academics to be a sign that Lee Kuan Yew, despite no longer being the Prime Minister of Singapore, still had some power in Singapore's government.

On 14th May 2011, Lee and Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong announced their retirement from the cabinet after General Elections 2011, which had changed Singapore's politics.

The late founding Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew was the first and only Minister Mentor of Singapore.

Kegon Falls

Kegon Falls (華厳滝 "Kegon no Taki") is a waterfall in Japan in Nikkō National Park in Tochigi Prefecture on the island of Honshū. It is fed by Lake Chūzenji, which is the source of the Oshiri River which flows through this waterfall. The waterfall is high. The Kegon Falls and Nikkō National Park are one of the most famous and popular places in Japan. Thousands of people visit each year. 
In 1927, the Kegon Falls was recognized as one of the "Eight Views" which best showed Japan and its culture in the Shōwa period.

The waterfall is also infamous for suicides, especially among Japanese youth (Werther Effect).


Razor shell

Razor shells, also called razor clams, are bivalves with the shape of an old-fashioned cut-throat razor. They use their shells to work into the sand and hide beneath the surface.

Ensis, of the family Pharidae, is found on sandy beaches in Northern Europe and Eastern Canada, such as Prince Edward Island. "Ensis arcuatus" prefers coarser sand than its relatives "E. ensis" and "E. siliqua".

There is also another family of razor shells, the Solenidae. Some think Solen and "Ensis" are close relatives, and some think they are similar because of convergent evolution. The matter will probably be made clear by sequence analysis in the furure.

The razor shell has been known to reach in length. The dorsal margin is straight while the ventral margin is curved. It can easily be confused with the slightly shorter and more curved "E. ensis" (in which both front and back are curved in parallel).

Razor shells have a fragile shell, with open ends. The shell is smooth on the outside and whitish in color, with vertical and horizontal reddish-brown or purplish-brown markings separated by a diagonal line. The periostracum is olive-green. The inner surface is white with a purple tinge and the foot is creamy white with brown lines .

The razor shell lives under the sand, using its powerful foot to dig to a safe depth. The digging has six stages, repeated. A digging cycle involves the muscular foot (which takes up a large part of the body) and the opening and closing of the valve and one end. 

The foot is inflated hydraulically, and pushed down into the sand to anchor the animal. Deflation of the foot then pulls the shell down. The razor shell also squirts water down into the sand, removing loose sand from its path. The foot exerts a pressure of 2 kg/cm.

The presence of the shell under the sand is revealed by a keyhole-shaped hole in the sand, made by its siphons during suspension feeding for plankton.

In the razor shell sexual development is highly synchronous: eggs and sperms are shed at the same time. In winter and spring consecutive spawns take place, interrupted by periods when more eggs and sperm are produced.

Cockle

Cockles are a group of (mostly) small, edible, saltwater clams. They are marine bivalve molluscs in the family Cardiidae. 

They are very common on sandy sheltered beaches throughout the world. The distinctive rounded shells of cockles are symmetrical, and are heart-shaped when viewed from the end. In most genera there are numerous radial ribs (ridges on the shell). The genus "Laevicardium", the egg cockles, have very smooth shells.

The mantle has three openings (inhalant, exhalant, and pedal) for siphoning water and for the foot to stick out. Cockles are capable of 'jumping' by bending and straightening the foot. Cockles burrow using the foot, and feed by filtering plankton from the surrounding water. Some species reach maturity quickly.

Confusingly, the common name "cockle" is also given (by seafood sellers) to a number of other small edible bivalves which have a somewhat similar shape, however these bivalves are in other families such as the Veneridae (Venus clams) and the Arcidae (ark clams). Cockles in the family Cardiidae are sometimes known as "true cockles" in order to distinguish them from these other species.

Wildfire

Wildfire is a general term which includes forest fires, grassland fires, bushfires, brush fires and any other vegetation fire in countryside areas.

Wildfires occur in every continent except Antarctica. They can occur naturally and spontaneously, but many are caused by humans, accidentally or deliberately. Fossil records and human history show that wildfires do occur at intervals. The Great Oxygenation Event and the spread of land plants made Earth a planet of fire.

Wildfires can cause extensive damage to property and human life, but they also have some beneficial effects on wilderness areas. Some plant species depend on the effects of fire for growth and reproduction, although large wildfires may also have negative ecological effects.

Strategies of wildfire prevention, detection, and suppression have varied over the years. One of the more controversial methods is controlled burn: People permit or light small fires to burn away some of the fuel for a potential wildfire. While some wildfires burn in remote forested regions, they can cause extensive destruction of homes and other property in the zone between developed areas and undeveloped wilderness.

Plants in wildfire-prone ecosystems often have adaptations to their local conditions. Such adaptations include physical protection against heat, increased growth after a fire event, and flammable materials that encourage fire and eliminate competition. For example, plants of the genus "Eucalyptus" contain flammable oils that encourage fire and hard sclerophyll leaves that resist heat and drought. This makes them dominant over less fire-tolerant species. Dense bark, shedding lower branches, and high water content in external structures may also protect trees from rising temperatures. Fire-resistant seeds and reserve shoots that sprout after a fire encourage species preservation, as in 'pioneer' species that specialize in restarting ecological succession after a fire.

Smoke, charred wood, and heat can stimulate the germination of seeds. Smoke from burning plants promotes contains orange butenolide, which induces germination of seeds.

Grasslands in Western Sabah, Malaysian pine forests, and Indonesian "Casuarina" forests are believed to have resulted from previous periods of fire. The deadwood litter of Chamise (Californian greasewood shrub) is low in water content and flammable, and the shrub quickly sprouts after a fire. "Sequoia" relies on periodic fires to reduce competition, release seeds from their cones, and clear the soil and canopy for new growth. Some have adapted to, and rely on, low-intensity surface fires for survival and growth. The optimum fire frequency for Caribbean pine in Bahamian pineyards is every 3 to 10 years. Too frequent fires favour herbaceous plants, and infrequent fires favour other tree species.


Bipod

A bipod is a V-shaped portable attachment that helps support and steady a device, usually a weapon such as a long gun or a mortar. The word "bipod" comes from the Latin and Greek words "bi" and "pod". "Bi" means "two" and "pod" means "foot", or "feet". A bipod is sometimes attached to a firearm to help support it. It also makes it more stable. It gives the best stability along two axes of motion: side-to-side and up-and-down. 

On firearms, bipods are often used on rifles and shotguns to allow the gun to rest and stop it from moving. They can also be seen on long-barrelled weapons. The bipod allows the gunner to rest the weapon on the ground, a short wall or other object. This allows for more accuracy. Different types of bipods are set up in different ways. Some bipods are a specific length that can not be changed, but some bipods' length can be changed. Mostly, when bipods are not being used, they are folded forwards, not back towards the gunner. Some types of bipod can fold into grips for the gunner to hold to keep the weapon steady.

When firing a weapon without a bipod, it is harder to aim and keep the weapon steady.
The good thing about having a bipod is that it makes weapons more accurate. At first, the bipod was only used on long-barreled rifles, such as snipers. However, light and heavy machine guns now use them, as well as small pistols.


Emperor Jomei

The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.

Jomei was a grandson of Emperor Bidatsu and a great-grandson of Emperor Kimmei.

Suiko did not make it clear who was to succeed her after her death.


Jomei's reign lasted 13 years.

The actual place of Jomei's grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Jomei's mausoleum. It is formally named "Osaka no uchi no misasagi".

Some short poems are believed to have been written by Emperor Jomei. For example,


Lawson Inada

Lawson Fusao Inada (born 1938 in Fresno, California) is an American poet and was the fifth poet laureate of the U.S. state of Oregon.

Inada is a third-generation Japanese American ("Sansei"). As a child, Inada and his family were interned during World War II.

Inada became a jazz musician, and this affected his writing. Inada cites jazz and his time in the internment camps as his chief influences as a poet. He studied writing at the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Oregon, and the University of Iowa.

He joined the faculty of Southern Oregon University in 1966.

In 1994, Inada's "Legends from Camp" won an American Book Award; and he was awarded poetry fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts.

In 2006 Inada was named Oregon's poet laureate.





Nobushige Hozumi

Hozumi was appointed to the House of Peers in 1890.

In 1915, he was ennobled with the title of "danshaku" (baron) under the "kazoku" system.

In 1916, Hozumi was named to the Emperor's Privy Council in 1916.

The people of Uwajima city named a bridge in his honor. He was also honored by a Japanese commemorative postage stamp in 1998.



Sport Relief

Sport Relief is a charity event from Comic Relief that happens every two years. It is held in association with BBC Sport. The event brings together the worlds of sport and entertainment to raise money to help vulnerable people in both the UK and the world's poorest countries. At the heart of the campaign is the Sport Relief Mile.



Pope Gregory I

Pope Gregory I (; c. 540 – 12 March 604), better known in English as Gregory the Great, was an Italian priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 64th Pope from 3 September 590 to his death in 604.

Gregory was born in Rome, but the date of his birth is not certain. He was the son of a noble Roman family.

Gregory was elected pope in 590.

Gregory is one of the four original Doctors of the Church, the title given by the Catholic Church to saints for their significant contribution to theology or doctrine through their research study or writing. 

Pope Gregory is venerated as saint and his feast day is celebrated on September 3. 


Casino Marina del Sol

The Casino Marina del Sol is the largest casino in Chile. It is in the city of Talcahuano. It opened in 2005 under a Chilean law allowing casinos. It contains a casino, hotel, gym, spa, disco, museum and car park.



Functional magnetic resonance imaging

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a special type of MRI that makes it possible to watch different areas of a person's brain while they do different tasks.

A functional MRI shows the use of oxygen in different brain areas. The Deoxyhemoglobin in blood absorbs a radiowave signal and later emits it (sends it back out). Oxyhemoglobin does not. When an area of the brain is active, the blood flow to that area increases and more oxyhemoglobin is delivered to supply the active cells with oxygen. This means less of the signal is absorbed. An active area of the brain absorbs and emits less energy than a less active area. This can be seen live as it is happening when different areas of the brain 'light up' on the images as they become less active.




My Prerogative

"My Prerogative" is a song first released in 1988 in the United States and then recorded again in 2004. The earlier version was by Bobby Brown. The 2004 version was by Britney Spears. Other people have covered the song since then. It has been sampled in other songs.

Cultural icon

A cultural icon can be a symbol, logo, picture, name, face, person, building, or other image. It is easily recognized and generally represents an object or idea with great cultural significance to a wide cultural group. It has a special status as representing, or important to, or loved by, a particular group of people, a place, or a period in history.

In the media, many well-known examples of popular culture have been called "iconic". Some writers say that the word is overused.

According to "Times of India":

Brands can show social values and changes, but many people have become tired of them. Many brands want to be cultural icons, but fail. Cultural icons are often timeless, imprinted in our consciousness. They can go through several stages, from "rumblings, undercurrents" via "catharsis, explosion" and "mass acceptance, ripple effect" to "glorification, representative value". While brands are rational and driven by features, cultural icons are emotional, free, driven by feeling, and creating emotional bonds. An example of "branding" might include the wearing of a consistent fashion look by such music stars as Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley, making them instantly recognizable. Royal or church clothing could also be understood as a form of emotional iconography.

Examples include: Andy Warhol, Budweiser, BMW, Chanel, Coca-Cola, Guinness, Harley-Davidson, LEGO, Martha Stewart, Nike, Norman Rockwell, Vuitton, Škoda Auto...

Cultural icons may be national, regional or about a city. And they can be symbols for a nation, or can show the values held by that state. For example, France uses Marianne as a symbol of the French Revolution. Bruce Lee is a symbol for the martial arts and philosophical culture of insight and knowledge in the entire world. Charlie Chaplin symbolises comical action while Clint Eastwood is a symbol for strength and masculinity. Jackie Chan is a global icon of comical stunts and martial arts based action. Salvador Dalí is the worldwide icon for the bizarre and eccentric.

Some writers say that the terms "icon" and "iconic" have been overused. A writer in "Liverpool Daily Post" calls "iconic" "a word that makes my flesh creep", a word "pressed into service to describe almost anything". The "Christian Examiner" added "iconic" and "amazing" to its list of overused words. It found over 18,000 "iconic" references in news stories alone, with another 30,000 for "icon", including use of it for SpongeBob SquarePants.

Sciadopitys

Sciadopitys, the Japanese umbrella-pine, is a unique conifer. It is endemic to Japan, and the sole surviving member of the family Sciadopityaceae. It is a living fossil with no close relatives: its fossils date from 230 million years ago.

It is an evergreen tree that can grow 15-27m tall. It's brown main shoots have whorls of 7–12cm long flexible green "cladodes". These look like, and perform the function of, leaves but are actually composed of stem tissue. Occasionally, a cladode will fork and produce a bud in the 'v' of the fork, just like a normal stem.

The cones are 6–11 cm long, mature in about 18 months, and have flattish scales that open to release the seeds.

It is a very attractive tree and is popular in gardens, despite its slow growth rate and high cost. Koyamaki was chosen as the Japanese Imperial crest for Prince Hisahito of Akishino, currently third in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne.

The plant was first introduced to Europe by John Gould Veitch in September 1860.

Infrared microspectroscopy has identified conifers of the family Sciadopityaceae as the principal source of Baltic amber.

General-purpose machine gun

A general-purpose machine gun (GPMG) is a machine gun which gets its ammunition from a belt. It can be used in many different roles: it can support infantry from a bipod or tripod or be put onto a helicopter or armoured vehicle. It can provide fire support for vehicles or infantry from a variety of mounts.

A general-purpose machine gun is generally a medium machine gun. It also fires rifle cartridges like the 7.62×51mm NATO or 7.92x57mm Mauser. It is usually used from a bipod, tripod or on a vehicle. This is because it is usually too powerful and heavy to be fired well on foot or while moving.

Some examples of general-purpose machine guns are:


Yamashiro Province

Kyoto is in the former Yamashiro Province. 

In 794, the capital of Japan was in Yamashiro. It remained in the province until the Imperial court moved to Tokyo in the 1870s.

During the Muromachi Period, the administrative seat of the Ashikaga Shogunate was in this province. 

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. Maps of Japan and Yamashiro Province were reformed in the 1870s.

The Kamo Shrines were the chief Shinto shrines ("ichinomiya") of Yamashiro. These are the Kamigamo Shrine and the Shimogamo Shrine.



Symphyla

Symphyla are soil-dwelling arthropods in the subphylum Myriapoda. 

They are relatives of centipedes. Symphylans look like centipedes, but are smaller and translucent. They move through the pores between soil particles. They are found from the surface down to a depth of about 50 cm. They eat decaying vegetation, and can do harm in agriculture by eating seeds, roots, and root hairs in cultivated soil.

They feed on decayed vegetation.

Pauropod

Pauropods are a type of myriapod. They form the only order in the class Pauropoda. About 500 species in four families are found worldwide, living in soil and leaf mold. 

Pauropoda are tiny soil myriapods, 0.5-1.5mm in length, with 8-11 body segments. The body appears to have fewer segments when viewed from above, because the dorsal shields (tergites) are fused in pairs. The true segments can be seen from the ventral side, each segment bearing a single pair of walking legs. A characteristic feature of pauropods is their branched antennae. 

Defence against herbivory

Defence against herbivory describes plant defences to avoid being eaten. There are many adaptations which improve the survival and reproduction of plants by reducing the effect of herbivores.

Many plants produce chemicals which change the behaviour, growth, or survival of herbivores. These chemical defences can act as repellents or toxins to herbivores, or reduce plant digestibility. Some plants, known as hyperaccumulators, specialise in storing heavy metals which are toxic to animals.

Some plants encourage the presence of natural enemies of herbivores, which in turn protect the plant. Some plants provide a home for ants which defend the plant strongly.

Other defensive strategies used by plants include escaping or avoiding herbivores in time or in place. They may grow where plants are not easily found or got at by herbivores. They may grow when herbivores are not around. Herbivores may get diverted towards non-essential parts, or a plant may be able to recover from the damage caused by herbivory.

Each type of defence can be either "constitutive" (always present in the plant), or "induced" (produced in reaction to damage or stress caused by herbivores). Plants can and do react to damage.

Historically, insects have been the most significant herbivores, especially the larvae of insects. The evolution of land plants is closely associated with the evolution of insects. While most plant defences are directed against insects, other defences have evolved that are aimed at vertebrate herbivores, such as birds and mammals.

The study of plant defences against herbivory is important, not only from an evolutionary viewpoint, but also because these defences can be used in agriculture, including human and livestock food sources.

Plant chemicals have evolved to affect insects. Some of these biochemical pathways exist in vertebrates, including humans. Many pharmaceuticals are got from the chemicals plants use to protect themselves from herbivores. Examples are opium, aspirin, cocaine, and atropine.

Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are produced by plants as a defence mechanism against insect herbivores. More than 660 PAs and PA N-oxides have been identified in over 6,000 plants. About half of them exhibit hepatotoxicity, that is, they attack liver function.

The earliest land plants evolved from aquatic plants around 450 million years ago (mya) in the Ordovician period. These early land plants had no vascular tissue and needed free water for their reproduction. Vascular plants appeared later and their diversification began in the Devonian era (about 400 mya). They had adaptations such as protective coating to reduce evaporation from their tissues.

Reproduction and dispersal of vascular plants in these dry conditions was got by the evolution of specialized seed structures. The diversification of flowering plants (angiosperms) during the Cretaceous period is associated with a sudden burst of speciation in insects. This diversification of insects represented a major selective force in plant evolution. It led to the selection of plants that had defensive adaptations. Early insect herbivores bit or chewed vegetation; but the evolution of vascular plants lead to the co-evolution of other forms of herbivory, such as sap-sucking, leaf mining, gall forming and nectar-feeding.

Our understanding of herbivory in geological time comes from three sources: 

Long thought to be a Mesozoic phenomenon, evidence for herbivory is found almost as soon as fossils which could show it. Within under 20 million years of the first fossils of sporangia and stems towards the close of the Silurian, around 420 mya, there is evidence that they were being eaten. Animals fed on the spores of early Devonian plants, and the Rhynie chert also provides evidence that organisms fed on plants using a "pierce and suck" technique. Many plants of this time are preserved with spine-like growths, which may have had a defensive role.

During the ensuing 75 million years, plants evolved a range of more complex organs – from roots to seeds. There was a gap of 50 to 100 million years between each organ evolving, and it being fed upon. Hole feeding and skeletonization are recorded in the early Permian, with surface fluid feeding evolving by the end of that period.

Herbivores depend on plants for food, and have evolved mechanisms to get this food despite the evolution of many plant defences. Herbivore adaptations to plant defence have been likened to "offensive traits". They are adaptations which allow increased feeding and use of a host plant. Relationships between herbivores and their host plants often results in reciprocal evolutionary change, called co-evolution.

When a herbivore eats, it eats plants that do not mount a sufficient defensive response. This creates the opportunity for plants which "can" mount a defence. So plants with defences become the more common. In cases where this relationship demonstrates "specificity" (the evolution of each trait is due to the other), and "reciprocity" (both traits evolve), the species are thought to have co-evolved.

The "escape and radiation" mechanism for co-evolution is the idea that adaptations in herbivores and their host plants have been the driving force behind speciation. The adaptations have played a role in the radiation of insect species during the age of angiosperms. Some herbivores have evolved ways to hijack plant defences to their own benefit, by sequestering (keeping) these chemicals and using them to protect themselves from predators.

Most of the plants which defend their leaves so vigorously nevertheless do need some animals. Up to 98% of flowering plants in tropical lowland rain forests rely on animals for pollination and seed dispersal.



Wheeling Tunnel

The Wheeling Tunnel is a pair of tunnels in Wheeling, Ohio County, West Virginia. The tunnels allow Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 250 to go through Wheeling Hill. Each tunnel has two lanes of each road.

The tunnel is run by the West Virginia Division of Highways. Opened in 1966, the Wheeling Tunnel cost $6.9 million to build. It was rebuilt between 2007 and 2010 for $13.7 million. In 2009, an average of 59,600 cars used the tunnel every day.

The Wheeling Tunnel is between exits 1A and 1B on Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 250. These two highways use the same road through the city of Wheeling to go through Wheeling Hill. People who need to use exit 1A at the western end of the tunnels use the tunnels' right lanes as acceleration (speeding up) and deceleration (slowing down) lanes. Changing lanes is not allowed inside the tunnel.

Several accidents involving semi-trailer trucks caused local politicians to try to ban trucks from the tunnel. Their plan would have the trucks use the nearby I-470.

A total of 13,000 square feet (1,200 m) of industrial tile was used to cover the inside of the tunnels. The tunnels cost $6.9 million (which is the same as $ million in 2024) to build. The then-governor of West Virginia, William Wallace Barron, and the state roads commissioner started construction on the tunnel on August 22, 1963. Barron said it was the largest single building project in the state's Interstate Highway program. The state gave the construction contract to C.J. Langenfelder & Son, Inc. in Baltimore, Maryland. During construction, several workers became sick after breathing a lot of carbon monoxide. As a result, the company stopped construction in 1964 until fans were installed. The tunnel officially opened to traffic on December 7, 1966.

The West Virginia Division of Highways began planning to rebuild the tunnel in 2005. Rebuilding began in January 2007. The plan allowed three months for the work. However, rebuilding of the eastbound tunnel took over eleven months. There were problems with the glue that attached the tiles to the tunnel wall. Problems with drains in the tunnel also caused delays. Workers found a coal mine in the tunnel. This also delayed the project.

Local officials suggested closing the tunnels because of these problems. They planned to just build a road over Wheeling Hill instead. Building the new road would have removed at least fifty families from their homes. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was against this plan because those people's houses would be destroyed. The state canncelled the plan for the new road. Rebuilding of the eastbound tunnel started again in July 2008.

During this rebuilding of the eastbound tunnel, the westbound tunnel was only closed overnight for rebuilding. New guard rails, fire sprinklers, and security cameras were added. The whole tunnel was also cleaned very well. Workers put a new road surface in the tunnel. A German tile maker replaced the tiles. The German company got the contract because no other company could finish the work on time. The company finished rebuilding the eastbound tunnel on October 31, 2008. The state closed the westbound tunnel in February 2010. It opened a month ahead of schedule in September 2010. The total cost of the project was over double the original plan. It totaled $13.7 million because of the delays.


Postgenderism

Postgenderism means 'beyond gender'.

The word is used to describe the idea, the social current or the evolution that fades or gets rid of gender and/or sex in humans and society.

It is also used to describe a set of social norms or a persons identity that goes beyond classical gender and sex-determinations and places them in the past, let them fade or dissapear.

Postgenderism argues that marking people into different sex of gender groups and gender roles is not needed and results in a limitation on the possibilities of people and what they can achieve in life.

It foresees that gender will disappear with humans that don't want this, as a result of always changing ways the human species organises their lives and as a result of new technology advances.

Kawachi Province

Kawachi province was established in the 7th century. In the 8th century, Izumi was separated from the older province during the reign of Empress Genshō. 

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. Maps of Japan and Kawachi Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"Hiraoka jinja" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Kawachi. 



Karl Friedrich Schinkel

Karl Friedrich Schinkel (13 March 1781 – 9 October 1841) was a Prussian architect, city planner, and painter. He also designed furniture and stage sets. Schinkel was one of the most importat architects of Germany and designed both neoclassical and neogothic buildings.

Schinkel was born in Neuruppin, Brandenburg. When he was six, his father died in Neuruppin's disastrous fire. He became a student of architect Friedrich Gilly (1772–1800) (the two became close friends) and his father, David Gilly, in Berlin. He made a trip to Italy in 1805. Then he started to earn his living as a painter.He worked for the stage and created in 1816 a star-spangled backdrop for the appearance of the "Königin der Nacht" in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's opera "The Magic Flute". When he saw Caspar David Friedrich's painting "Wanderer above the Sea of Fog" at the 1810 Berlin art exhibition he decided that he would never reach such mastery of painting and turned to architecture. After Napoleon's defeat, Schinkel worked at the Prussian Building Commission. In this position, he was not only responsible for reshaping the city of Berlin into a representative capital for Prussia, but also had to work projects in the expanded Prussian territories from the Rhineland in the west to Königsberg in the east.

From 1808 to 1817 Schinkel renovated and reconstructed "Schloss Rosenau", Coburg, in the Gothic Revival style.

Schinkel's style was more influenced by Greek than by than Imperial Roman architecture. His most famous buildings are found in and around Berlin. These include Neue Wache (1816–1818), the Schauspielhaus (1819–1821) at the Gendarmenmarkt, which replaced the earlier theater that was destroyed by fire in 1817, and the Altes Museum (old museum, see photo) on Museum Island (1823–1830).

Later, Schinkel moved away from classicism altogether and preferred the Gothic Revival style. 
Schinkel died in Berlin, Brandenburg.

Schinkel, however, is famous as well for his theoretical work and his architectural drafts. Some of his merits are best shown in his unexecuted plans for the transformation of the Athenian Acropolis into a royal palace for the new Kingdom of Greece and for the erection of the Orianda Palace in the Crimea. These and other designs may be studied in his "Sammlung architektonischer Entwürfe" (1820–1837) and his "Werke der höheren Baukunst" (1840–1842; 1845–1846). He also designed the famed Iron Cross medal of Prussia, and later Germany.


Hey, Soul Sister

"Hey, Soul Sister" is a hit song under the musical group Train. The single was released in August 11, 2009 as the lead single on Train's fifth studio album "Save Me, San Francisco". This song peaked at number 3 on Billboard Hot 100 and is Train's highest and its most commercially successful song, though the single was not eligible for any Grammy Award in the General Field.

Hardwood

Hardwood is wood from deciduous trees and broad-leaf evergreen trees. All hardwoods are angiosperms (flowering plants), the largest group of land plants.

Hardwood is contrasted to softwood, which comes from conifers, cone bearing seed plants. Hardwoods are not always harder than softwoods, balsa wood being an example of this. Hardwood trees are more varied than softwoods and there are about 100 times more species of hardwood than there are softwoods. Hardwoods usually have broad leaves. Hardwoods all have enclosed nuts or seeds, where softwoods are gymnosperms, naked seed plants.leis
Each species of hardwood has its own set of properties, however they have some properties in common. Hardwoods normally have broad leaves and come from deciduous or broad-leafed evergreen trees. Hardwoods grow slower than softwoods. Evergreen softwoods grow faster than deciduous hardwoods, and can grow to a larger size. Some hardwoods are excellent for carving. One of the hardest hardwoods is black ironwood which is recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the heaviest wood. Ironwoods are so dense that they sink in water rather than float as other woods do.

The properties of the wood are caused by its structure. Hardwoods have a denser structure, which is the reason they are usually harder and heavier. Hardwood has xylem vessels which are used to transport water. Their cell walls are strongly lignified: lignin is a hard material used to support plants above the surface. The quantity of lignin is probably the main factor in their hardness.

Softwoods have a vascular structure which looks similar to a bunch of drinking straws held together. They also have lignin, but of a slightly different type, and less of it than most hardwoods.

Common species of hardwood found in the USA, and Europe. Many species are also found in other areas of the world. This is not a complete list of all hardwood trees. 
The use of hardwood is much reduced in the modern world. The destruction of tropical and temperate forests has made it expensive and scarce. Many things once made of hardwood are now made of ceramics, plastic or softwood.

Hardwoods are often used to make items that get used a lot because of their density. These items include furniture, flooring, and utensils. They are also used in construction. Hardwoods are also less likely to decay or rot than softwoods. Furniture made by hardwood joinery is more expensive than that made from softwoods.

Utensils for use in preparing food can include things such as the vessel in the gallery below used by the Ede people to grind corn and grains for food. Other utensils include: spoons, chopsticks, bowls, plates and cups. Because of the dense nature of the wood used such a vessel can be used for many years without breaking. Other examples include the handle of the Luzon knife seen in the gallery. Because of the nature of sound transmission provide a good wood for musical instruments such as violins, guitars, pianos and hand drums such as the Djembe drum pictured in the gallery below.

Flooring is often made of hardwood because it can stand up to years of people walking on it with their shoes. An example is the flooring made from tiger-wood seen in the gallery below. Hardwoods are also used to make wood veneers to glue over other, cheaper woods, making them less expensive than solid hardwood while still giving them the appearance of a particular species of wood. This has become a common way of using tropical hardwoods that have a limited supply of trees due to deforestation occurring in many tropical countries. In Europe, hardwoods account for 29% and softwoods 71% of wood consumption. Hardwood has very short fibers about 1mm in length and is so also used to make fine paper such as writing paper, tissue, and printing paper. Paper with longer fibers such as paper bags, cardboard and shipping containers is made of softwoods.

A variety of objects made from different types of hardwood.




HM Prison Pentridge

HM Prison Pentridge was an Australian prison built in 1850 in Coburg, Victoria. The first prisoners arrived in 1851. The prison was closed on 1 May 1997.

Pentridge was often known by the nicknames "The Bluestone College", "Coburg College" or the "College of Knowledge". The grounds were originally landscaped by renowned landscape gardener Hugh Linaker. Since closing, much of the prison has been pulled down to make way for a housing development. Large buildings have been built and a 16 floor modern apartment block is being planned.

The northern section of the prison being developed by Valad Property Group and the other areas by Pentridge Village. The National Trust does not like the development plans approved by Heritage Victoria. These plans include taking down sections of the outside walls and building apartments between the historic prison buildings.

The prison was split into many divisions, named using letters of the alphabet.


Jika Jika, opened in 1980 at a cost of AU$7 million. It was a 'gaol within a gaol', designed to hold Victoria's toughest and longest serving prisoners. It was awarded the 'Excellence in Concrete Award' by the Concrete Institute of Australia. It was closed after the deaths of five prisoners in 1987.

Jika Jika had six separate units each at the end of radiating spines. It had electronic doors, closed–circuit television and remote locking. This meant it could use less staff but still have maximum security. The furnishings were sparse and prisoners exercised in escape proof yards.

In 1983 four prisoners escaped from ‘escape proof’ Jika Jika. When two prison officers were disciplined in relation to the Jika Jika escape a week–long strike occurred.

Inmates Robert Wright, Jimmy Loughnan, Arthur Gallagher, David McGauley and Ricky Morris – from one side of the unit – and Craig 'Slim' Minogue and three other inmates on the other side sealed off their section doors with a tennis net. Mattresses and other bedding were then stacked against the doors and set on fire. They covered windows in the day room with paper so the prison officers could not see which prisoners caused the damage.

Prisoners Robert Wright, Jimmy Loughnan, Arthur Gallagher, David McGauley and Ricky Morris died in the fire. Convicted Russell Street bomber Craig Minogue and three other inmates survived as they were evacuated when the fire started.

The graves of executed prisoners were unmarked in a corner of the prison. In 1929, 32 bodies were moved from the Melbourne Gaol during the building of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. These graves were found in 2008. The skeleton of bushranger Ned Kelly was among those discovered.

There were 11 executions at Pentridge. The gallows beam and the trapdoor were moved from the Melbourne Gaol and put into "D" Division in 1924.

When the gaol was closed, the beam and the trapdoor were taken back to the Melbourne Gaol to be part of its historical display.

Ronald Ryan was the last man executed at Pentridge Prison and in Australia. Ryan was hanged in "D" Division at 8.00 on 3 February 1967. He had been convicted of murdering a prison officer during an escape from the same prison. Later that day, Ryan's body was buried in an unmarked grave within the "D" Division. There is still debate about his hanging.






Michael Chabon

Michael Chabon (born May 24, 1963) is an American author. His first novel was called "The Mysteries of Pittsburgh" and published in 1988. Chabon was 25 years old. The book made him famous among writers. He has also written genre fiction. Chabon published "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay" in 2000. It won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2001. 

Michael Chabon was born in Washington, DC to Robert Chabon, a physician and lawyer, and Sharon Chabon, a lawyer. He knew he wanted to be a writer when he was a child. He studied at Carnegie Mellon University for a year before transferring to the University of Pittsburgh. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree there in 1984. Then Chabon went to graduate school at the University of California, Irvine and earned a Master of Fine Arts in creative writing.

In 1987, Chabon married the poet Lollie Groth. They divorced in 1991, and he married the writer Ayelet Waldman in 1993.







Izumi Province

Izumi Province was created during the reign of Empress Genshō. 

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. Maps of Japan and Izumi Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"Ōtori Shrine" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Izumi.



Settsu Province

The ancient capital city of the province was Osaka.

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. Maps of Japan and Settsu Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"Sumiyoshi taisha" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Settsu.



Chloris

Chloris ("Khloris" or Χλωρίς, from "Khloros" or χλωρός, meaning "greenish-yellow," "pale green," "pale," or "fresh") refers to several figures in Greek mythology. Some stories refer to different characters. Others refer to the same Chloris, but have different details.

Chloris was a Nymph. She represented spring, flowers and new growth. Her Roman equivalent was the goddess Flora. She was kidnapped by and later married Zephyr.

Meliboea was one of Niobe and Amphion's fourteen children, and the only one not killed when Artemis and Apollo killed the children as revenge. Meliboea was so scared by this that she turned permanently pale. She changed her name to Chloris ("pale one").

She later married Neleus and became queen in Pylos.

Chloris married the seer Ampyx (son of Elatus). She had a child called Mopsus, who also became a famous seer and later joined the Argonauts.

Portable Network Graphics

Portable Network Graphics (often shortened to PNG) is a bitmapped image format that uses lossless data compression.

Their most common use is within transparent images, as it does support an alpha channel along with a 16-bit color channel.

It is commonly used on the internet due to its high quality to size ratio. 

Curaçao

Curaçao is an island country in the Caribbean Sea. It is one of the ABC islands and is just a short distance north of the Venezuelan Paraguaná Peninsula, and it forms a part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Willemstad is the capital of Curaçao.

The largest ethnic group belongs to the Afro-Caribbean group with about 85% of the entire population (also includes mulattos). The remaining 15% are people of mainly European (mainly Dutch) descent, but there are also Indonesians, Colombians, Venezuelans, and others.

Papiamentu, Dutch, and English are the three official languages of Curaçao. Papiamentu is by far the most spoken language while sizable minorities speak the other two official languages.

Curaçao has a tropical climate. The temperatures are usually constant. The trade winds bring cool breeze during the day and the same trade winds bring warmth during the night. The coolest month is January with an average of 26°C in temperature and the warmest month is September with an average temperature of 28.9 °C (84 °F). The year's average maximum temperature is 31°C. The year's average minimum temperature is about 25°C.

The island broke off from the Netherlands Antilles in 2010. It has a very long history set all the way back to the 1800s.

Ox Mountain

Ox Mountain () is a story by the Chinese philosopher Mencius. In his time this mountain was in very bad shape, and everybody knew how it looked. Here is the story:

Mencius said, "The woods on Ox Mountain were once beautiful! On account of its being on the edge of a large country, it had been attacked with axes and hatchets, and then how could it remain beautiful? The refreshing breezes of day and night, and the moisture provided by rain and fog, did not fail to give rise to sprouts of vegetation. But cows and sheep have been repeatedly pastured there, and for that reason it has remained desolate. People observe its denuded state and assume that it never had any good resources. But how could this state be the true nature of this mountain?" — "Mencius", 6A:8

Mencius argued that "bad" human natures were produced just as the bad condition of Ox Mountain had been produced, so the answer to "bad" humans was to protect and nurture them from birth. He also thought that punishment does not do much good. It does not cure the root of the problem.

Human zoo

A human zoo was an exhibition that showed people from other cultures. Very often, this was done in similar ways than animals are shown in zoological gardens today. Most such exhibitions were done between 1870 and 1940. Human zoos attracted many people in Europe. They were often based on the idea of unilinealism, scientific racism and social Darwinism. Unilinealism or unilineal evolution is the idea that evolution happens only in one direction; some animal will be "at the peak" of evolution. Because of these ideas, some human zoos placed indigenous people (particularly Africans) in a continuum somewhere between the great apes and humans of European descent. Ethnographic zoos have since been criticized as highly degrading and racist.

Usually, these exhibitions were made to follow stereotypes. These used ideas from racism.

Rye Beach, New Hampshire

Rye Beach is a community in the U.S. state of New Hampshire. It used to be called Pannaway. It is along the Atlantic Ocean. It is in Rye, New Hampshire, United States. It is along New Hampshire Route 1A, near the south of a town named "Rye". 

In the community, there is a hostel. It is called the "Ocean house" and it was built in 1884. When it was built, it was small, but over time, it reached 4 stories and it had room for 250 guests. It was called the Philbrick Hotel when it was first built, but an Admiral called David Farragut visited the hotel, so it sometimes was called "Farragut House".

Dan Wheldon

Daniel Clive Wheldon (22 June 1978 – 16 October 2011) was a British motor racing driver. He was the 2005 Indy Racing League IndyCar Series champion. He was also the winner of the Indianapolis 500 in 2005 and 2011. He was killed at the age of 33, in a 15-car crash at the IZOD IndyCar World Championship.

Wheldon was born in Emberton, near Olney, Buckinghamshire, England. He started go-kart racing at the age of four. At the beginning of his career in open wheel racing, he had a rivalry with Jenson Button before he left the United Kingdom to start racing in the United States. He moved to the U.S. because he thought the chance for success there were greater than in the UK. He moved to the United States in 1999. He spent many years racing in lower open-wheeled circuits like the U.S. F2000 Championship Series, the Toyota Atlantic series and the Indy Lights series before moving to a higher series.

In 2002, Wheldon moved up to the IRL IndyCar Series for two races. He drove for Panther Racing with his teammate Sam Hornish Jr. In 2003, he joined Andretti Green Racing, winning the Rookie of the Year award. In 2004, he won his first IRL race at Twin Ring Motegi in Japan. He finished the 2004 season second in points with three wins.

In 2005, Wheldon won the Indianapolis 500. He finished the season first in points winning the IndyCar Series championship. He won six races during the season, breaking the record for most victories in one season. In November 2005, it was made known that Wheldon would be driving for Chip Ganassi Racing in the IndyCar Series in 2006. He went on to drive for Chip Ganassi Racing in the 24 Hours of Daytona, winning the race with Ganassi teammates Scott Dixon and Ganassi NASCAR driver Casey Mears.

Wheldon began the 2006 IndyCar season by winning the race at Homestead–Miami Speedway. This was a sombre race, as Paul Dana had died earlier while practising for the race. At the end of the 2006 IndyCar season, he and Sam Hornish Jr. were tied for the lead in the points. They both had 475 points. Hornish had four wins for the 2006 season, and Wheldon only had two. Because Hornish had more wins than Wheldon, he was made the 2006 Indy Car Champion.

The BMW Sauber Formula One team gave Wheldon the chance to drive for them, but he turned down their offer. They could not give him a ride for the whole season, so he decided to continue to focus on Indy.
On 22 June 2008, Wheldon won his 15th IndyCar Series race in the Iowa Corn Indy 250. He donated all of the money he won to help the victims of the tornadoes and flooding which had just happened in Iowa.

On 2 September 2008, Wheldon left Chip Ganassi Racing. He was replaced by Dario Franchitti. He had chosen to return to Panther Racing. He finished second in the 2009 Indianapolis 500. However, Wheldon did not finish in the top 10 in seven of the last eight races of the year. The next year, he ran well again at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, finishing second. He finished the 2009 season 9th in the series points. He ran well with Panther racing in 2009 but he did not win a race during his time with the team. Panther Racing decided to replace Wheldon with J. R. Hildebrand. He raced in the 2011 Indianapolis 500 with Bryan Herta Autosport, winning the race after J. R. Hildebrand crashed going into the final turn. He was very emotional after winning the race. He did not have a ride for the rest of the season. He was also worried about his mother who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. He dedicated his win to his mother. It was his first series win in three seasons.

On 16 October 2011, Wheldon was part of a 15-car wreck on lap 11 of the IZOD IndyCar World Championship at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. His car went into the air and hit the catch fence. He was taken by helicopter to the hospital. When he was taken to the hospital, he was declared dead from blunt force trauma to the head. He was 33. He is buried at the Calvary Catholic Cemetery in Clearwater, Florida.

Wheldon was a guest star in the voice cast for the TV series "Hot Wheels Battle Force 5".

Wheldon married his long-time personal assistant, Susie Behm, in 2008. The couple had two sons, Sebastian (born 1 February 2009) and Oliver (born 19 March 2011). His family lives in St. Petersburg, Florida.


Ise Province

The province had borders with Iga, Kii, Mino, Ōmi, Owari, Shima, and Yamato.

When the province was created in 646, its capital city was Uji-Yamada. 

Before Nara period, Ise Shrine, the holiest Shinto shrine was established in this province and here is introduced by a word "Kamukaze" in waka rhetorics in the Nara period. In the Edo period, the Tōkaidō road was the main route between the Imperial capital at Kyoto and the main city of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The road passed through Ise.

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan and Ise Province were reformed in the 1870s.

The World War II Japanese battleship "Ise" was named after this province.

"Tsubakiōkamiyashiro" ("Tusbaki jinja/Nakato jinja") was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") for the province. 


Iga Province

The province had borders with Ise, Ōmi, Yamato, and Yamashiro.

The capital city of the province was Ueno, also called Iga-Ueno.

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan and Iga Province were reformed in the 1870s.

Iga is a small mountain ringed basin (the Ueno basin) in the center of the Kansai region.

"Aekuni jinja" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Iga.



Curing salt

Curing salt (or pink salt or Prague powder #1) is mixture of salt and sodium nitrate that is used to preserve or cure meats or in the making of sausages. It contains 93.75% table salt and 6.25% sodium nitrite. The sodium nitrite in curing salt is used to stop the growth of "Clostridium botulinum" in order to prevent botulism. Curing salt may be dyed pink preventing it from being confused with table salt.


Ferdinand VI of Spain

Ferdinand VI (Fernando; 23 September 1713 – 10 August 1759) was a King of Spain July 1746 until his death in 1759 aged 49 He was the fourth son of the previous monarch Philip V and his first wife Maria Luisa of Savoy. The third Bourbon to rule Spain, he died childless and his half brother Charles became king. 

Born at the Royal Alcazar (Royal Palace) of Madrid, he was the youngest son of Philip V of Spain and his wife Queen Maria Luisa. His parents enjoyed a loving relationship, Ferdinand being their fourth child. However, his mother died in 1714 and the king married again, this time to Elisabeth Farnese, a niece of the Duke of Parma. Queen Elisabeth was a domineering woman who ruled her husband. As such, the new queen would have a further seven children including Ferdinand's own successor Charles III. Ferdinand was by temperament melancholy, shy and distrustful of his own abilities. When complimented on his shooting, he replied, "It would be hard if there were not something I could do." Shooting and music were his only pleasures, and he was the generous patron of the famous singer Farinelli, whose voice soothed his melancholy. As the younger son, his brother Louis, Prince of Asturias was heir to the throne. However, Louis died aged sixteen in 1724 having reigned for a mere eight months. As such Ferdinand became Prince of Asturias and heir to the throne. 

On 20 January 1729, Ferdinand married Barbara of Portugal, daughter of John V of Portugal and Maria Anna of Austria. This marriage further cemented a union with Portugal who had engaged Barbara's brother to Ferdinand's half sister. The very homely looks of his wife were thought by observers to cause the prince a visible shock when he was first presented to her. Yet he became deeply attached to his wife, and proved in fact nearly as adoring of her as his father was of Queen Maria Luisa.

When he came to the throne, Spain found itself in the War of the Austrian Succession which ended without any benefit to Spain. He started his reign by getting rid of the influence of the widow Queen Elisabeth and her Italian courtiers. As king he followed a firm policy of neutrality in the war between France and Britain, and refused to be tempted to join the war by the offers of either. The most important tasks during the reign of Ferdinand VI were carried out by the Marquis of Ensenada, the Secretary of the Treasury, Navy and Indies. He suggested that the state help modernise the country. To him, this was necessary to maintain a position of outward strength so that France and Great Britain would consider Spain as an ally without supposing Spain's renunciation of its claim to Gibraltar. Plans for modernising Spain included a new Treasury; the stimulation of commerce in the Americas; modernising the Navy; improving relations with the church and ensuring cultural progress. 

The death of his wife Barbara, who had been devoted to him, and who carefully abstained from political intrigue, broke his heart. Between the date of her death in August 1758 and his own in August 1759, he fell into a state of prostration in which he would not even dress, but wandered unshaven, unwashed and in a nightgown around his park. He was buried at the Convent of the Salesas Reales, Spain.


Neue Wache

The Neue Wache () is a building in central Berlin, the capital of Germany. It is located on the north side of the Unter den Linden. The Neue Wache was designed by the architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel, was built in 1816 and is a leading example of German neoclassicism. Originally it was built as a guardhouse for the troops of the Crown Prince of Prussia, the building has been used as a war memorial since 1931.

King Frederick William III of Prussia ordered the construction of the Neue Wache as a guard house for the nearby Palace of the Crown Prince, to replace the old Artillery Guard House. He commissioned Schinkel, the leading exponent of neoclassicism in architecture, to design the building: this was Schinkel's first major commission in Berlin.


Transitivity (grammar)

Transitivity in grammar is about whether a verb has an object or not. A transitive verb has an object; an intransitive verb does not. Examples:

A transitive verb is an action verb. It expresses something doable (something possible to do). The direct object is something or someone who is the receiver of the action (verb). In the first two examples above, the 'trip' and the 'book' are the direct objects. 'Enjoyed' and 'read' are the transitive verbs.

Audio description

Audio description is an explanation for visually impaired or blind people of television, dance, opera, movies, museums or other visual art. A narrator makes a description of what's happening, usually when nobody is talking. 

The first talking picture ever shown especially for the blind was a 1929 screening of "Bulldog Drummond" for members of the New York Association for the Blind and New York League for the Hard of Hearing, which had a live description for the visually-impaired people.

Descriptive video service which was started by the Public Broadcasting Service is used for the DVDs of certain movies as part of the audio description.

Teak

Teak is the common name for the tropical hardwood tree "Tectona grandis" and its wood products. "Tectona grandis" is native to south and southeast Asia and grows in many countries. It has been introduced to Africa and the Caribbean. Burma produces nearly one third of the world's total teak.

The word teak comes from the Malayalam word "theka" or "tekka". This tree is mentioned in the seventh-century literature of the Tamil language known as the Tevaram.

"Tectona grandis" is a large deciduous tree that is dominant in mixed hardwood forests. It has small, fragrant white flowers and papery leaves that are often hairy on the lower surface.

Reel-to-reel tape recorders

Reel-to-reel tape recorders (often called R2R, open reel decks, etc.) were used during the 20th century, mostly in professional studios from the 1940s and quickly spread into people’s homes in the 1950s and 1960s. Popularity peaked in the 1970s, probably because people needed higher quality recordings. This technology was like a revolution, because everyone could record any kind of sound (vinyl records, radio broadcast, voice and music), then play it many times without the quality getting worse, and they could overwrite it many times. This technology has some weak points though: size of reels, sensibility, durability; but still, it has certain advantages over today’s “digital media formats.” Also, some famous bands and artists used reel to reel technology as a musical instrument or even as a separate band.

These reel to reel decks are usually analogue sound devices using a magnetic tape of ¼ inch (i.e. 6.25 cm) width. This plastic tape is covered by a special magnetic substance which is being made into magnetic domains when it is being recorded. The tape recorder must have a record, playback and an erase head which transfer the signal onto the tape. The more expensive tape decks have three or six separate heads. Tape recorders combine knowledge both on mechanics and electronics. There must be very precise motors and moving parts, but also a complicated circuit board. It has to contain transistors, amplifiers etc.

The usual functions of tape recorders are:


These functions can be handled mechanically (system of rubber belts and metal levers), or electronically (magnets, coils, integrated circuits).

The tape speed is one of the things that finds out the playback time. This table gives information on tape speed and the playback time with an 18 cm reel.

There were many producers during the era of tape recorders, such as Sony, Akai, Revox, Teac, Pioneer, Technics, Tesla and many others. These producers usually had several product series', which were different in price and functions. The best ones had digital programmable counters, reverse mechanic, electronic buttons, they could use big reels (such as 26.5 cm). There was also a big selection of tape producers – Maxell, Basf (Emtec), Quantegy, Agfa, etc.

There were only a few producers of tape recorders in Czechoslovakia. The most important was Tesla, n.p. The main development was realized in Tesla Pardubice, but the mass production was held in Tesla Přelouč. Product numbers were in thousands pieces and tens of model lines. One of the most popular decks was monophonic "Tesla Sonet Duo" (1959). It was compact, portable and reliable. The collectors of Tesla decks agree that probably the most progressive model was "Tesla B73 Hi-Fi Stereo" (1978) which provided the principles to the later models. The supreme models were "Tesla B115", "B116" (1981) and "Tesla CM130", "CM160" (1986) which were able to compete with similar models made by world’s producers. Still, there were (political) restrictions, so the best ideas and solutions could not be realized. The manufacture finished in 1990 as this technology turned out to be out-of-date.

In the 1960s and 1970s, tape recorders were used to store programs and data. They record data as a sequence of tones of certain frequency. Nowadays, this method is used only to create backups, because the data rate of magnetic tape is very low.

Gym Class Heroes

Gym Class Heroes are an American hip hop band from Geneva, New York. They are associated with other musicians, including but not limited to Patrick Stump and Adam Levine of Maroon 5. On their album "As Cruel as School Children" is the song "Cupid's Chokehold", which samples "Breakfast in America" by Supertramp. The band's lead singer is Travie McCoy.

Artificial cranial deformation

Artificial cranial deformation, also known as head flattening or head binding is when the skull of a human is changed permanently, and on purpose. It is done by changing how a child's skull grows by putting force on the skull. Flat shapes, long shapes and round shapes can be used to do this. It is done on young children. This is because the skull is easier to shape at this time. Usually, the shape that will be used to change the skull is attached about a month after the baby is born. It stays on for around six months after this.

The practice has been most often used in native societies in the Americas, but there are examples from Asia and Europe. The Toulouse deformation was caused by wrapping the head of the newborn, possible to protect it from damage. In pre-modern societies the practice was surprisingly common. 
In most cases the reasons for the practice is not known.


Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination

Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination is an international treaty (agreement between countries) against racism and racial segregation as one of the series of international human rights law. The United Nations adopted the convention on 21 December 1965 in response to the apartheid policy of South Africa at that time. It came into effect on 4 January 1969. As of April 2019, 88 countries agreed to follow the rules of the Convention, and 190 countries agree in principle.

The Convention defines what racial discrimination is, so that every country in the treaty can agree on how to define discrimination. In Article 1 (the first agreement in the treaty) that racial discrimination is: "any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying ["getting rid of"] or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life."

Article 4 of the Convention forbids encouraging any type of racism including hate speech and discrimination. If a country agrees to the Convention, they must make hate speech and participation in hate groups illegal. To make sure that countries follow this rule, the Convention also introduced Article 14, which allows complaints of discrimination to be heard by a committee. Article 14 gives a person, or group of people, from any country who have suffered any discrimination against them because of their race, the right to submit a claim to a committee of the United Nations. These complaints can influence the law in the countries of the people making complaints. 

The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination is a body of human rights experts who monitor the implementation of the Convention. Eighteen independent human rights experts are members. They are elected for four-year terms, with half the members elected every two years. Nations that joined the treaty elect members by secret ballot. Each nation is allowed to nominate someone from its nation to run for election to the Committee.

Nations that have joined the treaty must submit regular reports to the Committee telling the legislative [l"ega"l], judicial ["court-based"], policy and other measures they have taken to give effect to the Convention. The first report is due within a year of the Convention being used in a country; afterwards, reports are due every two years or whenever the Committee requests. The Committee carefully reads each report and discusses its concerns and recommendations to the nation in the form of "concluding observations."

The Committee typically meets every March and August in Geneva.



International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is a treaty made by the United Nations. It is to help civil rights get better.

The rights are listed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is one of the most important treaties in international human rights law. The Covenant was adopted on 16 December 1966 with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It was put into force in 1976. The United Nations set up the Committee on Civil and Political Rights (CCPR) to carry out the treaty.


This Covenant has two optional protocols. One of them is to allow a citizen whose rights have been violated to claim before the CCPR. The other is to prohibit the death penalty. There are countries which ignore, or do not agree with, the optional protocols.



International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights

The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is a treaty made by the United Nations to ensure that the 
economic, social and cultural rights are affirmed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is one of the most important treaties on the international human rights law. This Covenant was adopted in 1966 together with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and entered into force in 1976.




Economic, social and cultural rights

Economic, social and cultural rights are a part of human rights. In an important United Nations treaty called The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the countries in the United Nations agreed that every person in the world should have these rights. Some examples of these rights include:
These rights were already listed in the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, they were included again in the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights to make sure that giving people these rights would be the law all across the world. 

A separate Covenant specifically on economic, social, and cultural rights was done for a reason. These rights were not included in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. These two Covenants were kept separate because civil rights are thought to be protected more strongly than economic, social and cultural rights. A separate Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights was done to make it clear how important these rights are.

As the Vienna Declaration says, all human rights must be protected equally because "all human rights are universal and cannot be divided."


Vickers machine gun

The Vickers machine gun (also known as the Vickers gun) was a machine gun that was used by the British Army from 1912 to 1968. It was made by Vickers Limited. The gun was very reliable. It was one of the most commonly used weapons in the first world war.

Royal Banner of Scotland

The Royal Standard of Scotland, (), also known as the Banner of the King of Scots, or more commonly the Lion Rampant of Scotland, is the Scottish Royal Banner of Arms. Used historically by the King of Scots, the Royal Standard of Scotland differs from Scotland's national flag, the Saltire, in that its correct use is restricted by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland to only a few Great Officers of State who officially represent the Sovereign in Scotland. It is also used in an official capacity at royal residences in Scotland when the Sovereign is not present.

The earliest recorded use of the Lion rampant as a royal emblem in Scotland was by Alexander II in 1222; with the additional embellishment of a double border set with lilies occurring during the reign of Alexander III (1249–1286). This emblem occupied the shield of the royal coat of arms of the ancient Kingdom of Scotland which, together with a royal banner displaying the same, was used by the King of Scots until the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when James VI acceded to the thrones of the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Ireland. Since 1603, the Lion rampant of Scotland has been incorporated into both the royal arms and royal banners of successive Scottish then British monarchs in order to symbolise Scotland; as can be seen today in the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom. Although now officially restricted to use by representatives of the Sovereign and at royal residences, the Royal Standard of Scotland continues to be one of Scotland's most recognisable symbols.

The Flag of Scotland, also known as the Saint Andrew's Cross or more commonly The Saltire, is the national flag of Scotland. The Saltire is the correct flag for everyone to fly in order to show both their loyalty and Scottish nationality. It is also, where possible, flown from Scottish Government buildings every day from 8am until sunset, with certain exceptions; for example United Kingdom "National Days".

Flower of Scotland

Flower of Scotland () is a Scottish song, used mostly at special occasions and sporting events. Although Scotland has no official national anthem, "Flower of Scotland" is one which is used, along with the older "Scots Wha Hae", "Scotland the Brave" and "Highland Cathedral". It was written by Roy Williamson of the folk group The Corries, and presented in 1967, and refers to the victory of the Scots, led by Robert the Bruce, over England's Edward II at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314.

Thistle

Thistle is a group of flowering plants which have sharp prickles on around the flower and are in the Asteraceae family. The prickles often all over the plant – on the stem and flat parts of leaves. This protects the plant against herbivorous animals, stopping them from eating the plant.

The term thistle is sometimes taken to mean exactly those plants in the group Cynareae (synonym: Cardueae), especially the genera "Carduus", "Cirsium", and "Onopordum". However, plants outside this group are sometimes called thistles, and if this is done thistles would form a polyphyletic group.

Thistle is the floral emblem of Scotland.

Genera in the Asteraceae with the word thistle often used in their common names include:

Plants in families other than Asteraceae which are sometimes called thistle include:

The thistle has been the national emblem of Scotland since the reign of Alexander III (1249–1286) and was used on silver coins issued by James III in 1470. It is the symbol of the Order of the Thistle, a high chivalric order of Scotland. It is found in many Scottish symbols and as the name of several Scottish football clubs. The thistle, crowned with the Scottish crown, is the symbol of seven of the eight Scottish Police Forces (the exception being the Northern Constabulary). The thistle is also the emblem of Encyclopædia Britannica, which originated in Edinburgh, Scotland. Carnegie Mellon University features the thistle in its crest.

According to a legend, an invading Norse army was attempting to sneak up at night upon a Scottish army's encampment. During this operation one barefoot Norseman had the misfortune to step upon a thistle, causing him to cry out in pain, thus alerting Scots to the presence of the Norse invaders. Some sources suggest the specific occasion was the Battle of Largs, which marked the beginning of the departure of King Haakon IV (Haakon the Elder) of Norway who, having control of the Northern Isles and Hebrides, had harried the coast of the Kingdom of Scotland for some years. Which species of thistle is referred to in the original legend is disputed. Popular modern usage favours Cotton Thistle "Onopordum acanthium", perhaps because of its more imposing appearance, though it is unlikely to have occurred in Scotland in mediaeval times; the Spear Thistle "Cirsium vulgare", an abundant native species in Scotland, is a more likely candidate. Other species, including Dwarf Thistle "Cirsium acaule", Musk Thistle "Carduus nutans", and Melancholy Thistle "Cirsium heterophyllum" have also been suggested.

Maud Grieve recorded that Pliny and medieval writers had thought it could return hair to bald heads and that in the early modern period it had been believed to be a remedy for headaches, plague, canker, sores, vertigo, and jaundice.

Football in Scotland

Association football is the most popular sport in Scotland. Scotland has the second oldest national Football Association in the world (behind England's FA), and the trophy for the national cup, the Scottish Cup, is the oldest sporting trophy in the world.

Scottish football club Rangers F.C. have won a world record 54 league titles.

Scotland and Scottish football clubs hold many records for football attendances;

The highest ever attendance for a UEFA competition match was in the 1969-70 European Cup semi-final at Hampden Park, Scotland's national stadium. A record 136,505 people attended that Cup semi-final played between Celtic and Leeds United 
The attendance of 149,415 for the Scotland vs. England match of 1937 at Hampden Park is also a European record. 
The attendance of 146,433 for the 1937 Scottish Cup final between Celtic and Aberdeen at Hampden Park is a European record for a club match. 
Rangers' record attendance of 118,567 is a British record for a league match. 

Professional football in Scotland is split into four leagues. The winners of the league move up into the league above it, and those who finish last in the league move down into the league below it. The leagues are:


Micrograph

Wolfgang Köhler

Wolfgang Köhler (21 January 1887 – 11 June 1967) was a German psychologist who, like Max Wertheimer and Kurt Koffka, helped create Gestalt psychology. He was the first to show that apes could solve problems by thinking.

In 1910–13, he worked with fellow psychologists Max Wertheimer and Kurt Koffka. He and Koffka were subjects for Wertheimer’s studies, which led them to conclusions about the nature of vision. They collaborated on the founding of a new holistic attitude toward psychology called Gestalt theory, from the German word for “whole". This was influenced by some earlier work of Carl Stumpf (Köhler’s teacher) and Christian von Ehrenfels. Wertheimer had attended Ehrenfels' lectures at the University of Prague.

Köhler’s famous quote, “the whole is different from the sum of its parts” is usually quoted differently. Though perhaps a simple error made in translation, many lectures in textbooks of modern-day psychology quote Gestalt theory by saying “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”. It is difficult to imagine that a translation error occurred here, especially when considering that ‘greater’ is ‘größer’ and ‘different’ is ‘unterschiedlich’ in German, respectively.

In 1913, Köhler left Frankfurt for the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands, to be the Director of the Prussian Academy of Sciences anthropoid research station. Here, Köhler observed how chimpanzees solved problems, such as that of retrieving bananas when placed out of their reach. They stacked wooden crates to use as makeshift ladders, in order to get the food. If the bananas were placed on the ground outside the cage, they used sticks to lengthen the reach of their arms.

Köhler concluded that the chimps had not arrived at these methods through trial-and-error. American psychologist Edward Thorndike claimed this was the basis of all animal learning: his law of effect. Instead, the chimps had an insight (also known as an “aha experience”). They saw the answer mentally, then they got the bananas in a way which was, in Köhler’s words, “unwaveringly purposeful”.

So, he concluded that the animals were capable of problem-solving and that they did "not" arrive at their methods through trial and error. This is one of the most important findings from the research done on apes. Köhler’s work on the mentality of apes was a turning point in the psychology of thinking. In the book "The mentality of apes", Köhler explains that he was inspired to work with the chimpanzees for two main reasons. The first was because the “structure of their brains is more closely related to the chemistry of the human body and brain-structure than to the chemical nature of the lower apes and their brain development” Köhler (1925). The fact that human traits can be observed in the everyday behaviours of this animal was very intriguing for Köhler. Kohler also wanted to gain knowledge of the nature of intelligent acts.

Köhler recognized that, like humans, there is a great deal of individual differences in intellect. Chimps showed that they were able to grasp the objects around them in a variety of fashions. This is incorporated in their everyday playing behaviours. For this reason, it was not necessary to use experimental tests to introduce chimps to handle matter. In his book, Köhler describes how the apes use their hands: “large, powerful and flexible hands are natural links between himself and the world of things, and he attains the necessary amount of muscular force and co-ordination at an earlier age than the human child” Köhler (1925).

Gluten-free diet

A gluten-free diet is a diet that excludes foods that have gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and possibly oats. Most breads, cakes, pastas/noodles, beers and pizzas are made with gluten. Gluten is used as a food additive in the form of a flavoring, stabilizing or thickening agent. It is often called "dextrin". Some non-foods, such as medications and vitamin supplements, especially those in tablet form, may contain gluten as a binding agent.

A gluten-free diet is the only medically accepted treatment for wheat allergy and coeliac disease (in North America, it is usually spelled "celiac disease").

Some gluten-free diets also exclude oats. Doctors do not agree on whether oats affect coeliac disease sufferers.
Many alcoholic beverages are gluten free, but many types of whiskey and beer contain gluten, because using grains is a necessary part of their production.
Gluten-free diets have become popular worldwide. Some say that such a diet can cause problems with Vitamin B and magnesium intake by the body, because wheat improves the rate in which humans body can use them.
Gluten-containing ingredients sometimes are used as colorants, preservatives and thickeners in products such as ice cream and ketchup.
Even some cosmetics like lip balm and lipsticks can contain gluten, so persons wanting to follow such a diet need to learn about which products contain wheat and its byproducts.


Little Havana

Little Havana () is a section of Miami, Florida, where many Cuban immigrants and refugees have settled. The high number of Cuban refugees Florida receives is due to its proximity to Cuba. It is called Little Havana because Cuba's capital is Havana. There is also a smaller Little Havana in Tampa, Florida.

In recent years, increasing numbers of Honduran, Nicaraguan, and Guatemalan immigrants have moved into the neighborhood. At the same time, increasing numbers of Cubans left the area for the suburbs in western Miami. Part of Little Havana is now called Little Managua named after the Nicaraguan capital.

The Calle Ocho Festival is held in Little Havana.

Howard Stern

Howard Stern (born January 12, 1954) is an American radio and television personality known for his radio show, The Howard Stern Show.

Stern was born in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York City.

He originally started as a disc jockey for a New York station playing rock music. He discovered a talent for comedy, and developed a wide-ranging confrontational style that encouraged listeners to call in. Eventually, in the 1990s, his show was widely distributed. As an example, in one of his most infamous episodes, he persuaded a female caller to have phone sex with him on the air. He made deep buzzing noises into his microphone, and had her sit on a speaker with the volume turned up.

Stern's crude style of entertainment (which many listeners support) has earned him the title "King Of All Media" -- at least in the eyes of his fans. His show is frequently the subject of complaints by listeners (and occasionally ethnic groups) who find his shows offensive. Radio stations airing his show have occasionally been subjected to fines for violating FCC requirements due to the content of the show, but the parent conglomerate (Infinity Broadcasting) that hosts Stern's show seems to consider these fines a necessary price to pay, in order to support Stern's continuing popularity. In 1994 Stern ran for Governor of the state of New York. 

Stern is the most popular and well-known of a variety of offensive radio hosts known generally as "shock jocks." In spite of the crude content of his show, many radio listeners consider Stern's delivery to be far from the worst quality radio aired today. His popularity has given rise to a number of imitation "shock jocks" who attempt to outdo Stern in terms of offensiveness and rudeness...but these imitators have found themselves with more troubles to worry about than listener ratings. In 2002 rival radio hosts Opie and Anthony were fired from their popular radio show after they encouraged a couple to engage in sexual intercourse at Saint Patrick's Cathedral in New York City, then airing a running commentary of the act on their show. Stern, his supporters note, has not gone out of his way to offend the general public in this manner.

On January 15, 1998 Lance Carvin, who had been stalking Stern, was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for threatening to kill Stern and his family.

Don Omar

Don Omar (born William Omar Landrón Altagracia Riviera; February 10, 1978 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic), is a Dembow singer, composer, actor, comedian and producer. He is believed to be one of the best dembow artists in Dominican Republic, Venezuela and all of Latin America and world by many music critics and fans alike. Omar is best known for his songs "Dile" and "Dale Don Dale" from his first album "The Last Don" and "Reggaeton Latino". His songs are mostly about life and love; some examples of these would be "La Recompenza" ("The Reward") and "Aunque te Fuiste" ("Even Though You Left Me"). The net worth is of $ 22,5 million of dólares. and sold over 70 million of sales.

His musical debut began in the evangelical church Iglesia de la Restauración in Cristo en Bayamón, where he became the pastor for four years but he left because of a sentimental disappointment. At this time he continues to take part in several groups that sing during religious celebrations.

He began singing and composing at age 13, feeling very close to the reggaeton style, which began to develop in Puerto Rico in the early 1990s. He started in reggaeton with Yaga duo Yaga and Mackie Ranks in 1990 with the song Tha Cream in the album of the same name.

He started his career after many obstacles when Héctor Delgado (from the duo Héctor & Tito) gave him an opportunity to be a backup singer for them.

Don Omar has been in trouble with the law for possession of drugs and firearms. He is often the subject of accusations for the content of the lyrics. He is accused of inciting violence and pornography. The strong rhythm, dancing and sensual characterizing also this musical genre, it is no exception, like many other reggaetoneros.

His contribution to the genre by the title Dale Don dale in The Last Don, was named the best Latin / hip-hop rap album of the year 2005 and voted best Latin pop artist by the Billboard.

In 2005, he produced Los Bandoleros.

His compositions use little repetitive style commonly used in the reggaeton style, to tell stories he imagines.

Don Omar released an album King of King in 2006. He is the first sales of Hispanic language music records in the United States with this album as well as in some Latin American countries. With this album Don Omar is proclaimed "El Rey" ("king" in Spanish) of reggaeton and official promoter of the musical genre.

Don Omar plays in Fast and Furious 4 and Fast and Furious 5 with Tego Calderon. The song Danza Kuduro is repeated at the end of the film Fast and Furious 5 and the song Taboo during the scene where Mia is at the market.

The album Don Omar Presents: Meet The Orphans was released on November 16, 2010. The album features the artists under Don Omar's Orfanato Music Group label and other reggaeton artists.

The album has been well received as it won the award for Best Urban Music Album at the 2012 Latin Grammy Awards.

After a decade's long rivalry feud with fellow artist Daddy Yankee for the "King of Reggaeton" title, in early 2016 Daddy Yankee and Don Omar announced in a Billboard press conference that they would perform together on stage in a concert series called The Kingdom World Tour. The tour announcement left many fans in disbelief, while selling out in minutes in cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, Los Angeles, New York. Discussing the tour and his rivalry with Daddy Yankee, Don Omar said “Let me clarify: I am not his best friend, and he is not my best friend, but we respect each other. That desire to be the best is what has pushed us to be better.”



Kat DeLuna

Kat DeLuna (born Kat Emperatriz de Luna; November 26, 1987) is an American crossover artist. Signed to Epic Records, she sings songs in both English as Spanish. At the age of 12, she was invited by the 'Queen of Merengue', Milly Quezada, to sing with her on stage in front of a big crowd of over thousand people. In April 2004, she opened for J Records musician Cassidy as part of the all Latino girl group Coquette. 
Kat and her family moved from The Bronx, US to the Dominican Republic early, where she was raised in poverty. Kat spent her time listening to Aretha Franklin and Billie Holiday records. At the age of 14, they moved back to the US, where Kat realized her potential as a singer. With that goal in mind, Kat was accepted to the New Jersey School of the Performing Arts. As a freshman, she scoured the pages of The Village Voice for auditions. After many auditions, DeLuna received a call for an all girl group, which later became the first Latina, Hip Hop/R&B group: Coquette. While being a part of Coquette, Kat continued to search for opportunities to pursue her dream of becoming a solo artist. At age of 15, Kat entered a Coca-Cola sponsored karaoke competition. Her version of "I Will Always Love You" won the competition. The competition also resulted her into meeting the legendary Cuban salsa singer Rey Ruiz. Ruiz gave KAT advice and with it, she started writing her own music and has continued to do so since. 

Currently, Epic Records, her label, is in the process of launching a promotional campaign for her worldwide first single "Whine Up". The song features Elephant Man and a music video is in the works. On the official website, a video of DeLuna doing a choreography to the song is shown on the front page. Also Elephant Man is shown in the short rehearsing video.

Pena's former boyfriend, also a singer, was involved in an argument with singer Obie Bermudez after a multiple artist concert in Texas during the summer of 2004; the argument was apparently started by jealousy from her ex-boyfriend towards Bermudez.

During September of that year, Pena openly admitted to a magazine that she and the famous Puerto Rican rapper Bermudez have been having a serious relationship.

Raven-Symoné however declined saying that "I want to work on my solo career right now. I loved being a Cheetah Girl but I don't want to be known as 'Galleria from The Cheetah Girls’, and as 'Raven Baxter' forever. Right now I just want to be Raven-Symoné." 

Adrienne Bailon (who at the time had a reoccurring role on "That's So Raven") claimed to "understand" but still said she was "disappointed" in Raven for not continuing what she started. However, the 3 remaining Cheetahs recorded "I Won't Say (I'm In Love)" for "Disneymania 3". They also kept their names from "The Cheetah Girls" movie. Kiely was known as "Aqua", Adrienne was known as "Chanel" and Sabrina was known as "Dorinda". After seeing how much of a response "I Won't Say (I'm In Love)" received, Disney quickly approached the Cheetahs for a recording contract. Raven was again offered her spot back in the group and again declined. This upset Adrienne so much that she quit as her role of Alana on "That's So Raven". The newly reformed Cheetah Girls signed the contract for one album with Walt Disney Records. The stage names Dorinda, Chanel and Aqua were also dropped at this time. Right before the release of their debut album they released a single for the "Chicken Little" soundtrack called Shake a Tail Feather, a re-make of an old Ray Charles song. Their debut album was a Christmas album titled Cheetah-licious Christmas. They made a music video for their debut single also titled "Cheetah-Licious Christmas". They performed this at the Walt-Disney Christmas Day Parade and were featured in The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. After the success of their Christmas album they were reported as signing to Hollywood Records (Owned by Disney but for more successful artists such as Aly & AJ and former Cheetah Raven-Symoné). 

At this time a Cheetah Girls television series was in the works as well. It did however convince former cheetah Raven-Symoné to return for television and film purposes only. The show filmed 4 episodes when it was stopped because "That's So Raven" was being renewed for its fourth and final season. The Cheetahs (Including Raven) did however quickly meet up again for a sequel called "The Cheetah Girls 2" and recorded a soundtrack for the movie also. It was set to debut on the Disney Channel on August 25, 2006. Raven however left the Cheetah Girls after filming wrapped claiming "Lots of work" that had to be completed. 

The third Cheetah Girls film was made in 2007. They officially disbanded in 2008.

Conservative Judaism

In Conservative Judaism, Jewish values can be divided into ethical and ritual laws - the ethical laws do not change, while the ritual laws are used in different customs. Because oftentimes Jews have to be a part of the society they live in, some of the ritual laws must be adapted to it. Such adaptations also allow modern lifestyles.

Another belief in conservative Judaism is that the texts that are the basis of Judaism should not be read literally, and that they can be analyzed and criticized like any other text. In Conservative Judaism, women are seen as equal to men and are allowed to sit with the men when attending synagogue, whereas in Orthodox Judaism for example, women are expected to sit in a different area. Women are also allowed to not wear head coverings when attending synagogue.


Stringybark Creek

Stringybark Creek is a small creek in the Wombat Ranges, Victoria, Australia. It is famous for the place where three policemen were murdered on 26 October 1878. The policemen, Sergeant Michael Kennedy, Constable Thomas Lonigan, and Constable Michael Scanlan were searching the forest for the Kelly brothers, Ned and Dan Kelly. They were wanted for the attempted murder of another policeman, Constable Fitzpatrick.

The creek is in the Toombullup State Forest, 50km from Benalla and 36km from Mansfield. The area has been developed for visitors and includes picnic area, camping, toilets and walking tracks. A memorial stone was put in place in 2001. It is near the remains of the hut. A tree near the site of two of the murders (Lonigan and Scanlan), the Police/ Kelly Tree, was scarped by a farmer in the 1930s. He carved the names of the three murdered police into it as a memorial. It has had a small copy of attached to it. This caused great upset to the families of the murdered policemen. The other murder site (Kennedy's) is approximately 400 - 500 metres North West. It is across the Stringybark Creek Road. 

A group of three policemen from Mansfield set out to search for the Kelly brothers who they thought were hiding in the bush near Mansfield. They set up camp at Stringbark Creek on 25 October 1878, not knowing that the Kellys were living in a small hut on Bullock Creek, less than 1km away. The next day Kennedy and Scanlan went to search the nearby forest, while Lonigan and Constable Thomas McIntyre stayed at the campsite. The Kellys heard noises from the police camp and went to investigate. Ned Kelly decided to try and capture the policemen and take their guns, horses and food. He called on the two policemen to give themselves up. McIntyre raised his hands, but Lonigan attempted to run and reached for his gun. Ned Kelly shot him in the eye.

The bushrangers then waited for Kennedy and Scanlan to return. When they rode into the camp, McIntyre warned them that the Kelly brothers were there, and to give themselves up. Scanlan went to unsling his rifle and was shot dead immediately. Kennedy jumped off his horse, and while shooting at the Kellys ran into the bush. Ned and Dan Kelly chased after him, shooting him twice as they hunted him for over 800 yards. Kennedy surrendered. Kelly walked up to him and shot him again in the chest and killed him. During the earlier shooting at Scanlan and Kennedy, McIntrye was able to get onto Kennedy's horse and escaped. He reached Mansfield on the next day to report the deaths.

Ned Kelly, Dan Kelly, Moz Johnston, Joe Byrne and Steve Hart were made outlaws, and a large reward was offered for their capture, either dead or alive. The three murdered policemen were taken to Mansfield and buried in the cemetery. A large memorial, funded by public donations, was built in the main street of Mansfield.

In 1879, G. Wilson Hall printed a book in Mansfield called "The Kelly Gang, Outlaws of the Wombat Ranges". It included a song called "Stringybark Creek" which is believed to have been written by Joe Byrne. It described in verse the story of what had happened. The first verse is:<br>
"A sergeant and three constables"<br>
"Rode Out from Mansfield town,"<br>
"Near the end of last October"<br>
"For to hunt the Kellys down."<br>
"So they travelled to the Wombat"<br>
"And they thought it quite a lark,"<br>
"And they camped upon the borders"<br>
"Of a creek called Stringbark."

The song has been recorded many times, including the Australian folk-rock band the Bushwackers on their 1979 album, "Bushfire".
In 1880 a local school teacher's poem was read at the unveiling in Mansfield of the monument dedicated to the three murdered policemen. It was accepted as an honest description of the tragic events.


First Minister

A First Minister is the leader of a government. In the United Kingdom, First Minister was once used to mean the same as Prime Minister. Winston Churchill's famous quote: "I did not become His Majesty's First Minister so that I might oversee the liquidation of the British Empire!"

First Minister is now used to describe the leaders of the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. See:


North Borneo at the Olympics

North Borneo at the Olympics is a history which includes only one summer olympic game in one country and two athletes.

This was the only Olympic appearance for the colony. North Borneo sent two athletes who took part in the triple jump. They failed to win a medal.

In later years, athletes from North Borneo competed as part of the team from Malaysia.



Forbes list of billionaires

Forbes list of billionaires is based on an yearly measurement of wealth and assets which is published by "Forbes" magazine. The latest list was released in March 2014.

On the 32nd list of world's billionaires, the gap between the top 1% of the billionaires and the rest continues to widen. A record of 2,208 billionaires were in the ranking and the total wealth is $9.1 trillion, up 18% since 2017. For the first time, Jeff Bezos was listed as the top billionaire due to Amazon's rising stock price that resulted in one person's biggest one year gain in wealth since Forbes started tracking in 1987.


Gestalt psychology

Gestalt psychology is a theory of mind and brain formed in Berlin early in the 20th century. 

The idea is that the brain sees things as a whole. The gestalt effect is most clear with sight. We recognise figures and whole forms, not just a collection of lines and curves. In psychology, gestaltism is often opposed to structuralism. The phrase "The whole is greater than the sum of the parts" is often used when explaining Gestalt theory. A better wording is : "The whole is different from the parts".

Early 20th century theorists, such as Kurt Koffka, Max Wertheimer, and Wolfgang Köhler (students of Carl Stumpf) saw vision of objects as all elements taken together in a global construct. This 'gestalt' or 'whole form' approach sought to understand perception – seemingly innate mental laws which determined the way in which objects are perceived.
It is based on the here and now, and in the way you view things. It can be broken up into two: figure or ground, at first glance do you see the figure in front of you or the background?

These laws took several forms. An example is the way we tend to see similar objects, or close together objects, as meaningfully connected. Gestalt has been criticized for being merely descriptive, but it has formed the basis of much further research into the perception of patterns and objects, and of research into behavior, thinking, problem solving and psychopathology.

Gestalt psychology was a forerunner to modern cognitive psychology. It is distinct from gestalt psychotherapy.

Gestalt psychologists were the first to study problem solving in humans and apes. Wolfgang Kohler showed that chimpanzees could solve problems by thought alone; Max Wertheimer studied how diagrams helped students solve geometry problems, and Karl Duncker studied general problem-solving. Generally, both Wertheimer and Duncker preferred the broader term 'productive thinking' to 'problem solving', but it is not used much now.

Max Wertheimer

Max Wertheimer (Prague, 15 April 1880 – New Rochelle, New York, 12 October 1943) was a psychologist who was one of the three founders of Gestalt psychology, with Kurt Koffka and Wolfgang Köhler.

From 1929 to 1933, Wertheimer was a professor at the University of Frankfurt. When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of the Third Reich in 1933, it became apparent to Wertheimer that he must leave Germany. In the end, he accepted an offer to teach at The New School in New York.

In New York he continued to investigate problem-solving, or what he preferred to call “productive thinking". The relationship between the book and his earlier work was this: all the problems in the book except one could be solved by considering geometric diagrams. In other words, they were partly visual in essence, and could be represented and partly solved visually. That thread ran through much of the gestalt work.

Wertheimer completed the book (his only book) in late September 1943, and died just three weeks later of a heart attack. Wertheimer was buried in Beechwood Cemetery in New Rochelle, New York.

The phi phenomenon is an optical illusion described by Wertheimer in 1912, in which the persistence of vision was exploited by the cinema film, applied by Hugo Münsterberg in 1916. This optical illusion is based in the principle that the human eye is capable of perceiving movement from pieces of information, for example, a succession of images. In other words, from a slideshow of a group of frozen images at a certain speed of images per second, we observe constant movement.


Optical illusion

An optical illusion (also called a visual illusion) is one which shows images that differ from normal reality. 

The information gathered by the eye is processed in the brain to give a perception. That is normal, but in these cases the appearance does not tally with a physical measurement of the stimulus source. 

There are three main types of visual illusion: 

The general explanation for most illusions is the way the brain works on sense data to produce a meaningful perception. A great 19th century psychologist Hermann von Helmholtz described perception as "unconscious inferences from sensory data and past experience". Richard Gregory discussed how the brain makes an hypothesis about what's out there, and sometimes the hypothesis does not quite work out. His model of perception is an interaction between data from sense organs and previous knowledge and experience.

Researcher Mark Changizi of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York thinks optical illusions are due to a 'neural lag'. When light hits the retina, about one-tenth of a second goes by before the brain translates the signal into a visual perception of the world. Scientists have known of the lag, and have discussed how humans compensate for it. Some suggest that our motor system somehow modifies our movements to offset the delay.

Changizi asserts that the human visual system has evolved to compensate for neural delays by generating images of what will occur one-tenth of a second into the future. This foresight enables humans to react to events in the present, enabling humans to perform reflexive acts like catching a fly ball and to maneuver smoothly through a crowd. Illusions occur when our brains attempt to perceive the future, and those perceptions do not match reality. 

Essentially, the ideas of Helmholz, Gregory and Changizi are similar. We do not mechanically turn sense data into a picture of the world, as some had thought. What we do is use our brains to work out what it is we are looking at. This involves the use of memory and logic, though at a fast rate. The process is very good, but not foolproof. When it fails we get an illusion.


Cassette single

A cassette single is a recording of a single song sold on a compact audio cassette. Record companies introduced this sales format in the 1980s. At that time, vinyl record album sales were declining in favor of cassette recordings; the cassette single was introduced to replace the vinyl 45 record in a similar way.

The sales of cassette singles did not exceed vinyl single sales to the same extent as cassette albums had. As compact disc players became more common, cassette singles were for the most part replaced by CD singles.

Guitar solo

A guitar solo is a portion of a musical performance when a guitar is used without other instruments.

In addition to their roles of rhythmic and harmonic accompaniment, guitars are well-suited to performing solo lines. This can take the form of a prominent section where the guitar is heard over other instruments, or unaccompanied, the guitarist providing all the necessary melody and harmony themselves. Often a guitar solo is a virtuosic performance in the rock music idiom with a heavily-overdriven electric guitar. However, solo instrumentation for the guitar can be found in a wide variety of musical styles and eras.

Many famous guitarists are known for their solo work. Approaches to solo creation vary from the jagged/atonal approach of Andy Gill from Gang of Four and Andy Partridge from XTC, the studio-produced soundscapes of Jimi Hendrix or Bill Nelson, or the composed approach of Frank Zappa.

The use of the guitar solo in popular music was especially notable during the 1980s, where a flashy and attention-grabbing instrumental was virtually obligatory for a guitar-based band. In later years, guitar solos became viewed as something of an "80s cliché", and their usage declined. Guitar solos in pop music have become much rarer, and more subdued and understated when used.



Music of Colombia

The music of Colombia is an expression of the Colombian culture and has many music types. Modern Colombian culture is a mixture of African, native and European (especially Spanish) music, as well as more modern American and Caribbean musical forms, such as Trinidadian, Cuban and Jamaican.

In the late 1950s, Mexican rock artists like Enrique Guzmán and Cesar Costa became very popular in Colombia. Soon, native rock bands like Los Speakers earned popularity too. Starting in 1967, native bands like Genesis combined native music types (like cumbia) with rock.

Cumbia is a mixture of Spanish and African music (which slaves brought to Colombia). In the 19th century, Colombia got rid of slavery. Since that time, Africans, Indians and other ethnic groups mixed more fully in Colombian music. Styles like bambuco, vallenato and porro was very important. When the waltz became popular in the 19th century, Colombian musicians invented a version called pasillo.

The Band Perry

The Band Perry is an American musical group. The members are Kimberly, Reed and Neil Perry (the first was born in 1981, the second in 1988 and the latter was born in 1990). Their self titled first record was released on October 12, 2010.




Criminal (song)

"Criminal" is the fourth single released under Britney Spears' seventh studio album "Femme Fatale". This song was released on September 30, 2011 and has gotten positive critical acclaim.

Sound check

A soundcheck, simplified as sound check is an activity that takes place a couple of hours before a concert. The performer(s) and the sound crew run through a short song to make sure that the sound in the venue is clear and at the right volume and tonal frequencies. Soundchecks are especially important for popular and other musical genres that use heavily-amplified PA systems; having correct sound is very important to the success of such events. A soundcheck remains part art and not all science, however, because the acoustics of a venue often change somewhat once it is filled with an audience.

Artists who change their set list during the course of a concert tour often use soundchecks as a rehearsal opportunity to try out new material or revive old material, before possibly introducing such material into the concert properly.

Carey his written nine novels:

Emperor Kanmu

, also written as "Kammu", was the 50th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. His reign started in 781 and ended in 806.

Kanmu was the first monarch of the Heian period of the history of Japan.

Before he became the monarch, this prince's personal name ("imina") was .

Prince Yamabe was the eldest son of Prince Shirakabe (later known as Emperor Kōnin). According to the , Yamabe's mother was a descendant of King Muryeong of Baekje.

Kanmu had 16 empresses and consorts, and 32 imperial sons and daughters. Among his sons were Emperor Heizei, Emperor Saga and Emperor Junna.

Before he became the monarch, he was Crown Prince for eight years.

During his reign, Kanmu tried to simplify the hierarchy and the functions of his government.

The capital of Japan was moved from Nara (Heijō-kyō) to Nagaoka (Nagaoka-kyō) in 784. The capital would be moved again in 794 to Kyoto (Heian-kyō).

Kanmu named Sakanoue no Tamuramaro (758-811) to lead a military expedition against the Emishi.


According to the Imperial Household Agency, the mausoleum ("misasagi") of Kammu is in Kyoto. The emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine at this location.

The years of Kammu's reign are identified by more than one era name ("nengō").


National Cleavage Day

National Cleavage Day, also known as NCD, is a annual celebration that is held in South Africa. It is held in March or April each year. Many countries celebrating on 19th of May (Proverbs 5:19) The event is sponsored by the brassière marketer wonderbra. National Cleavage Day was started in 2002 and held at the beginning of April every year. The "NCD" was started in April 2002 in South Africa.

Along with the Wonderbra, "Cosmopolitan" and 5fm, a SABC radio station have sponsored this event. According to Samantha Paterson, the manager for Wonderbra, the National Cleavage Day had become a great start for women's independence and power in all forms of life, from their careers to their relationships and to their own destiny. Anita Meiring, public relations consultant for Wonderbra, explained The event was created to help build women empowerment about their breast being very unique and that they should be very proud of it. She also stated that "It gives men a legitimate (real) reason to stare (look) at boobs (women's breast)."

National Cleavage Day is celebrated in offices, restaurants and bars throughout the nation.
This event was given negative feedback from Dr. Siqwana-Ndulo. She had said that "This is a pure marketing tool using people's bodies." She then stated that, "The commission is against any person or advertising company which uses people's bodies for marketing purposes be it advertising a car or anything of that sort."


Chauchilla Cemetery

Chauchilla Cemetery is a cemetery that has prehistoric remains of prehispanics. Their bodies, which are mummified, contain artifacts. The cemetery is south of the city of Nazca in Peru.

The cemetery was discovered in the 1920s. However, it was last used in the 9th century. The cemetery has a lot of very important burials that happened over a period of 600 to 700 years. The cemetery was first used around the year 200. This cemetery is a very important source of archaeology to Nazca culture. Because the cemetery was damaged a long time ago, it was protected by Peruvian law in 1997. Tourists pay around seven U.S. dollars for a two-hour tour of the cemetery.

The bodies inside the cemetery have been preserved which is probably because of the dry climate in the Peruvian Desert. However, the funeral rites were also an important factor. The bodies had clothes on them which were made of cotton and were painted with a resin. They were bought in the cemetery, which was built from mud bricks. The resin was thought to have kept out insects and slowed bacteria from feeding on the bodies.

Estaquería, a nearby cemetery, may have given clues to show how the bodies were preserved. At Estaquería, archaeologists have found wooden pillars which was first thought to have been used for astronomical sightings. However, it is not thought that those posts were used to dry the bodies. This was a mummification process. This clue helped archaeologists to understand why these thousand-year-old bodies still had their hair and some soft tissue, like skin, still attached to them.

Heian period

The is a time in the Japanese history from 794 to 1185. This grouping of years is named after city of Heian-kyō, which is the early name of present day Kyoto.

The Heian period began in 794 when the capital of Japan was moved to Heian-kyō. It lasted until 1185, which is the beginning of the Kamakura period.

In this period Kyoto was the center of Japanese culture. It was also in this period that the first known novel was published. The author was a woman. Poetry was very popular in Heian-kyo at the time.







Garnishment

A garnishment is the means for collecting money judgments against a defendant by ordering third parties to pay money directly toward the plaintiff. Wage garnishments are a process of deducting money off employees' monetary compensation (including their salary); these types of garnishments continue until entire debts are paid and can be taken for any debt, however usual examples are:


Wage garnishments can adversely affect credit reputation or one's ability to open bank accounts.

Gigantoraptor

Gigantoraptor is a genus of giant oviraptorosaur theropod dinosaur that lived 70 million years ago in the later Cretaceous. It was discovered in 2005 in Inner Mongolia.

Since 2001, in a quarry, remains of the sauropod "Sonidosaurus" had been uncovered. In April 2005 Chinese paleontologist Xu Xing was asked to reenact the discovery of "Sonidosaurus" for a Japanese documentary. Xu obliged them by digging out a thighbone. As he wiped the bone clean, he suddenly realized it was not from a sauropod, but from an unidentifiable theropod about the size of "Albertosaurus". He stopped the filming to secure the serendipitous find. This way, the discovery of the "Gigantoraptor" fossil was captured on videotape.

In 2007 the "Gigantoraptor erlianensis" was named and described by Xu and colleagues. The type specimen was found in strata dating to about 70 million years ago. It is the remains of a single subadult individual.The partial skeleton lacks the skull but includes the lower jaws, a single neck vertebra, most of the back, tail and leg elements.

"Gigantoraptor" belonged to the Oviraptorosauria, a group named after "Oviraptor". Compared to other known members, "Gigantoraptor" was much larger, about three times as long and 35 times more massive than the earlier discovered oviraptorosaurid "Citipati". Xu "et al." estimated the length at and the weight at 1400 kilogrammes. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul even gave an estimate of two tonnes (2.2 tons).

The toothless lower jaws of "Gigantoraptor" are fused into a broad shovel-like mandibula. The skull would have been over half a metre long and toothless, probably with a horny beak. The back tail vertebrae are lightened by spongeous bone. The front limb is rather long because of an elongated slender hand. The humerus is bowed outwards to an exceptionally large extent and has a very rounded head. The first metacarpal is very short and carries a strongly diverging thumb. The hindlimb is also long because of an elongated lower leg. The thighbone is relatively slender and short with a distinct head and neck. The foot is robust with large and strongly curved toe claws.

No direct evidence of feathers was preserved with the skeleton. It might have been "naked" because it is three hundred times more massive than the smaller feathered species. Very large animals rely more on mass for temperature regulation, losing the insulating coverings found on their smaller relatives. Arm feathers were probably still present on "Gigantoraptor", since their main functions, such as display and covering the eggs while brooding, are not related to the regulation of body heat.

In 2007 Xu "et al." put "Gigantoraptor" into the Oviraptoridae family. But in 2010 a second analysis of "Gigantoraptor" found it was in the sister group, the Caenagnathidae. This was later confirmed by other studies.

The diet of "Gigantoraptor" is uncertain. Although some oviraptorosaurs such as "Caudipteryx" and "Incisivosaurus" are thought to have been mostly herbivorous, "Gigantoraptor" had long hind legs with proportions that allowed for fast movement, and large claws, a combination that is not usually found in herbivores of this size. Paul suggested that "Gigantoraptor" also was a herbivore and used its speed to escape predators.

The specimen has advanced ossification and growth rings in the fibula that indicate it was likely eleven years of age when it died. It appears to have reached an early young adult stage at age seven, and probably would have grown much larger when it reached the adult stage. This indicates a growth rate that is faster than in most large non-avian theropods.

The existence of giant oviraptorosaurians as "Gigantoraptor" explains several earlier Asian finds of very large, up to 53 centimetres long, oviraptorosaurian eggs. These fossil eggs were laid in enormous rings with a diameter of three metres.


University of Tübingen

The University of Tübingen, officially the Eberhard Karl University of Tübingen (; ), is a public university in the city of Tübingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

The University of Tübingen was founded in 1477. In Germany, Tübingen became known as one of the "five classical university towns".

In 2010, Tübingen joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Dartmouth College (USA), Durham University (UK), Queen’s University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of Western Australia (Australia) and Uppsala University (Sweden).

In 2012, the university established the Tübingen Center for Korean Studies at Korea University (TUCKU). This is Tübingen’s third branch in Asia after the Center for Japanese Language in Kyôto and the European Center for Chinese Studies (ECCS) at Peking University.

Alumni include former German President Horst Köhler and Nobel laureates Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard, Hartmut Michel and Günter Blobel.

Notable professors include Joseph Ratzinger and Hans Kung.


Pylorus

Pylorus is a part of digestive system that separates stomach and duodenum. The pylorus controls the opening between the stomach and the duodenum. It stops large pieces of food from leaving the stomach. It also stops digested food from returning to the stomach from the duodenum. It is made of a muscle which stops food when contracted. When the pylorus is relaxed, it allows a small amount of food to pass as its passage is narrow.

Huxley family

The Huxley family is an English family. Members of the family had top careers in science, medicine, art, and literature. Some family members were also high level public servants in the United Kingdom. 

Thomas Henry Huxley (THH) was the oldest male in the family. He was a zoologist and comparative anatomist. He was one of Charles Darwin's main supporters.

Thomas had several grandsons including Aldous, Julian, and Andrew. Aldous Huxley wrote the books "Brave New World" and "Doors of Perception". Julian Huxley studied evolution, wrote "Evolution: the New Synthesis", and was the first director of UNESCO. Andrew Huxley was a Nobel prize winning physiologist and was appointed to the Order of Merit. Thomas and Andrew both served as President of the Royal Society, a century apart.

Many of their relatives succeeded in other walks of life.


Starfleet

In the fictional world of the "Star Trek" television series, books, and video games, Starfleet is the group that manages spaceexploration. From the second half of the 22nd Century through at least the 25th Century, Starfleet is a part of the United Federation of Planets, a political group of planets with intelligent life, including Earth and Vulcan. Members of Starfleet come from many different planets and are from many different species. Though the mission of Starfleet is peaceful exploration of space, the group is also responsible for defense of Federation planets.

In the television series "", set in the 22nd Century, Starfleet is an Earth space exploration program whose mission is "to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldy go where no man has gone before". Captain Jonathan Archer and the crew of the starship "Enterprise" travel into deep space to meet alien species and do scientific research.

In the year 2161, Earth joins the United Federation of Planets, which adopts Starfleet as its space exploration service.

Starfleet officers have ranks similar to Earth's Naval forces, and follow the Chain of Command, but they are not a military group. There is one law all Starfleet officers are required to follow called the Prime Directive. It says that members of Starfleet are not allowed to interfere (become involved in) the way a primitive society develops. Starfleet officers are trained at Starfleet Academy, located in San Francisco. Starfleet officers are given orders by Starfleet Command, located on Earth.

Starfleet explores space using space vessels called starships. The USS Enterprise is the most well known starship, and there have been several of them in Starfleet from the 22nd Century through at least the 24th Century. One of the most famous Starfleet captains is James T. Kirk (from the television series Star Trek). Another famous Starfleet captain is Jean-Luc Picard, the captain of the USS Enterprise-D. 

Starships are large and can carry from hundreds to over a thousand crew members. They are capable of scientific research, as well as carrying weapons called phasers and photon torpedoes for defending the Federation. They travel much faster than the speed of light using an engine called warp drive.

Simon van der Meer

"This is a Dutch name. The family name is" van der Meer, "not" Meer.
Simon van der Meer (24 November 1925 – 4 March 2011) was a Dutch particle accelerator physicist. He won the Nobel prize in physics. Another physicist, Carlo Rubbia, also won this prize. He won the prize because of his work for the CERN project. This led to the discovery of W and Z particles, which are the two most important things in matter.

Simon van der Meer was one of four children. He was raised in The Hague, Netherlands. His father was a school teacher, and his mother came from a family of teachers. He went to school at the city's gymnasium. He graduated in 1943 when the German army had control of the Netherlands. In 1945, van der Meer went to the Delft University of Technology. He earned an engineer's degree there in 1952. He joined CERN in 1956, and he stayed there until he retired in 1990.

In 1966, when van der Meer was skiing with his friends in the Swiss mountains, he met Catharina M. Koopman, who became his wife. They had two children – Esther (born 1968) and Mathijs (born 1970).

After getting his engineer's degree in 1952, Simon van der Meer worked for the Philips Research Laboratory in Eindhoven. When he was there, he was mainly working on high-voltage equipment and electronics for electron microscopes. In 1956, he moved to CERN, which was new at the time. When he first started at CERN, his work was mainly on technical design, and power supplies. While he was working at CERN, he invented the idea of stochastic cooling, which led to the discovery of W and Z bosons. In 1984, van der Meer and Carlo Rubbia won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work with the project.

IPhone 4S

The iPhone 4S is the fifth iPhone that was created by Apple. It is very thin, and has a touchscreen.

It was first available for pre-order on October 7, and it went on sale on October 14 in the United States, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan. It was made available in more countries over the next few months.

The iPhone 4S had the same design as the iPhone 4, but has several new features such as an upgrade to the Apple A5 processor, and an 8 MP camera with 1080p video recording. It shipped with iOS 5, which is the fifth major version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS. It had new features such as iCloud, iMessage, Notification Center, Reminders, and integration with Twitter. It also had a voice activation system named Siri that was included in later generations of mobile Apple products.

The iPhone 4S introduced a new automated voice control system called "Siri". It first operated only on the iPhone 4S. It allows the user to give commands to the iPhone, which Siri can execute and respond to. For example, iPhone commands such as "What is the weather going to be like?" will generate a response such as "The weather is to be cloudy and rainy and drop to 54 degrees today". These commands can vary greatly and control almost every section of the phone. The commands given do not have to be specific and can be used with natural language. Siri makes it is much easier and/or possible for people to use device functions while driving, exercising, or when they have their hands full. It also means people with trouble reading, seeing, or typing can access the phone more easily.

Cy Twombly

Edwin Parker "Cy" Twombly, Jr. (April 25, 1928 – July 5, 2011) was an American artist. He used the nickname "Cy", after his father and the star baseball pitcher Cy Young.

Twombly was known for his large-scale, freely scribbled, calligraphic-style graffiti paintings, on solid fields of mostly gray, tan, or off-white colors. He exhibited his paintings worldwide. Twombly's paintings blur the line between drawing and painting. Many of his best-known paintings of the late 1960s are reminiscent of a school blackboard on which someone has practiced cursive "e"s. Twombly had at this point discarded painting figurative, representational subject-matter, citing the line or smudge – each mark with its own history – as its proper subject. 

Later, many of his paintings and works on paper moved into "romantic symbolism", and their titles can be interpreted visually through shapes and forms and words. Twombly often quoted the poet Stéphane Mallarmé, as well as many classical myths and allegories in his works. Examples of this are his "Apollo and The Artist" and a series of eight drawings consisting solely of inscriptions of the word "VIRGIL". In a 1994 retrospective, curator Kirk Varnedoe described Twombly's work as “influential among artists, discomfiting to many critics and truculently difficult not just for a broad public, but for sophisticated initiates of postwar art as well". After acquiring Twombly's "Three Studies from the Temeraire" (1998–99), the Director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales said "sometimes people need a little bit of help in recognising a great work of art that might be a bit unfamiliar". He is said to have influenced younger artists such as Anselm Kiefer, Francesco Clemente, and Julian Schnabel.


Owsley Stanley

Owsley Stanley (born Augustus Owsley Stanley III, January 19, 1935 – March 13, 2011) also known as Bear, was an important person in the rise of the San Francisco Bay counter-culture. During the Beat-era years of Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters scenes, he was also important in the explosion of 1960's psychedelia culture.

A brilliant and eclectic crafts-person he was best known under the name of "Owsley" - a magician like figure who "cooked" LSD. Under the professional name of "Bear" he is known around the world as the music producer, engineer and artist to psychedelic rock band the Grateful Dead.

Bear was the road manager for The Grateful Dead. He met the band when Kesey had them come to an Owsley Acid test party to try a new batch of LSD. Bear's technical interests helped the band's interest in electronic, acoustic and mystical properties of sound. He became their sound engineer. He was one of the first to mix sound live, and in stereo, and achieved a high sound quality. He often recorded live tapes behind his mixing board. They developed their own high-fidelity audio components and sound-systems for their performances. The bands tours evolved around a gigantic "Wall of Sound", with stacks of Stanley-designed equipment. His expert changes meant fans of the Grateful Dead could enjoy the full sonic range of the concert even in the outdoors.

His abilities helped The Dead to experiment further afield, playing in dramatic and remote places. Their need for support to tour with big shows, and their need for special equipment, meant that companies formed to supply them. These needs were the starting point for both Marin County's high-end music-instrument makers Alembic Inc and concert-sound manufacturer Meyer Sound. And his drug making helped to get the band started.

Stanley was one of the first people to manufacture mass quantities of LSD. His LSD is still known for its quality and purity. Between 1965 and 1967, Stanley produced more than 1.25 million doses of LSD. This amount of quality LSD was responsible for the wide popularity of the drug, and the development of an anti-authoritarian, anti-war counter-culture. From the 'Sunset Strip Riots' in Los Angeles, to the Summer of Love in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury was described as "the biggest LSD party in history.". The name "Owsley" was linked to cheap LSD of good quality.

Stanley died in an car accident in Queensland, Australia on March 13, 2011.

Separatist movements of India

Separatist movements are groups of people wanting to start a new country that is separate from a large existing country.

In India, some groups want separate countries for groups that have ethnic or language differences. Some groups call for a separate state, others for regional autonomy while some extreme groups demand complete full independence from India.
Part of Arunachal Pradesh is belong to the disputed territory of Southern Tibet.


The Arunachal Dragon Force (ADF), also known as the East India Liberation Front, is a violent secessionist movement in the eastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. The ADF seeks to create a state resembling the pre-British Teola Country consisting of area currently in Arunachal Pradesh as well as neighboring Assam.


Geographically and culturally, the region now called north-east India is between the two traditions of Indic Asia and Mongoloid Asia and is regarded as part of Southeast Asia. This geographical-cultural condition of "in-betweenness" is an important factor in the area’s crisis of identity. The leaders of the present-day "underground outfits" continue to struggle for independence, as the political integration of the northeast to India was brought about without the approval of its people. The people of northeast India, who are culturally Mongoloid, refuse to accept the caste-ridden social system advocated by ‘Indian’ culture. Similar struggles for independence are also going on in other northeastern subdivisions or sister regions, such as Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Nagaland. Assam has been the hotbed of militancy for a number of years due to its porous borders with Bangladesh and Bhutan. The main causes of the friction include the anti-foreigner agitation in the 1980s and the simmering Assam-Bodo tensions. The insurgency status in Assam is classified as very active. The government of Bangladesh has arrested and extradited senior leaders of ULFA or the United Liberation Front of Asom was formed in April 1979 to establish a sovereign state of Assam through an armed struggle. In recent times the organisation has lost out its middle rung leaders after most of them were arrested. The National Democratic Front of Bodoland was formed in 1989 as the Bodo Security Force, aims to set up an autonomous region Bodoland. Problems in Meghalaya arise from the divide between tribals and non tribal settlers, identity issues and growing corruption besides the fear of being reduced to minority by native tribals. The activity status is classified as active.


Nagaland was created in 1963 as the 16th State of Indian Union, before which it was a district of Assam. Insurgent groups classified as active, mainly demand full independence. The Naga National Council led by Phizo was the first group to dissent in 1947 and in 1956 they went underground.

Both India and Pakistan say that Kashmir is a part of their nation. At one time, they were both a single country. India was divided based on which Party(Congress or Muslim league was more popular in each state. They fought wars over which country should get Kashmir. Separatists say that Kashmir should be a country that is separate from both India and Pakistan.

In 2013 entered the "Billboard" Hot 100 again.

Equivalence relation

In mathematics, an equivalence relation formula_1 on a set is a mathematical relation that is symmetric, transitive and reflexive. For a given element formula_2 on that set, the set of all elements related to formula_2 (in the sense of formula_1) is called the equivalence class of formula_2, and written as formula_6. 

With an equivalence relation, it is possible to partition a set into distinct equivalence classes. As an example, consider the set of all animals on a farm and define the following relation: two animals are related if they belong to the same species. Under this relation, a cow is related to an ox, but not to a chicken. In fact, this relation is an equivalence relation because:
In this example, the set of all animals related to a particular ox forms an equivalence class—it is the set of cattle. In fact, the set of all animals on this farm can be partitioned into different equivalence classes (in this case species).


Solid-state drive

A solid-state drive (SSD) is a data storage device, typically used in a computer. It uses flash memory to store data even after power is turned off. SSDs are designed to access data in the same way as traditional hard disk drives (HDDs). An HDD can usually be directly replaced with an SSD. Most SSDs use the SATA interface, the same as what HDDs use. Some SSDs also use other interfaces for other devices, like servers.

The best thing about solid state drives is that they have a much faster read/write speed than hard disk drives. They also have no moving parts, which means they don't make noise or break as easily. However, SSDs are often more expensive than a hard drive. This also means that for the same price, someone can get much more capacity if they select an HDD instead. However, SSD prices had dropped over the years due to advancements in technology. 

A hybrid drive combines the features of an HDD and an SSD into one unit. It contains a large HDD and a smaller SSD cache to improve performance of frequently accessed files. A hybrid drive can offer almost the same performance as an SSD, and it can contain more capacity. The price is also lower than of an SSD. The main market for this drive are the laptop users, as these devices can accommodate no more than one drive. However, As of 2023, hybrid drives are becoming obsolete due to decreasing prices of SSD. 

The solid state drive technology is improving quickly, and new SSD models are being introduced often. However, they have not gained popularity among many users. We still find that HDDs are still dominating the market. Sales of SSDs are expected to escalate and overturn that of HDDs after 2020. The biggest draw back to SSDs over hard disk drives is that SSDs have a limited amount of read and writes it can take before the sector fails, as is not a issue with traditional hard disk drives. This is not a problem for most people, unless if you are heavily reading and writing to the SSD. However, modern SSDs often have more read and write cycles, and there are specific SSDs that can sustain such heavy read and writes. They are often used in servers.

When SSDs were first introduced into the market, manufacturers' made sure that they fit into the slots and bays initially used by the HDDs. As such, they had the 3.5 and 2.5 inch form factors. However, as technology advances, more form factors emerged. Smaller form factors that directly interfaces with PCIe and NVMe slots emerged. These included the mSATA, PCIe and M.2, form factors. 

NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) is a communications interface and driver for PCIe SSDs and NVMe SSDs have higher transfer rates than traditional SATA SSDs up to 32,0000MB/s. It also has a new mechanism called “Submission and Completion Queue” that manages and controls data flow into queues. Like a computer with 6 cores might have 6 queues and are kept in the core's cache. The traditional form factors 2.5 inch and M.2 as well as being able to slot into a PCIe x16 with an expansion card. Also pushing the max capacity of a consumer NVMe SSD to 16TB as of 2023. NVMe SSDs are becoming more common, and most devices made in the last 5 years include at least one NVMe slot. NVMe SSDs come in 2230, 2242, 2260, 2280, and 22110. Most consumer SSDs use 2280, while smaller devices use 2242 and now 2230 SSDs. 22110 SSDs are usually used in servers, while 2260 NVMe SSDs are not that common. . . .

Martial Célestin

Martial Lavaud Célestin (October 4, 1913 – February 4, 2011) was the first Prime Minister of Haïti. He was born in Ganthier and worked as a lawyer. President Leslie Manigat made him prime minister in March 1988. A coup removed Célestin from power on 20 June 1988.

Norwegian Crusade

The Norwegian Crusade was one of several religious wars in which European countries fought against Muslims in Turkey and the Middle East. The First Crusade was 1095-1099. The Norwegian Crusade was next, from 1107 to 1110. King Sigurd I led the crusade. Sigurd was the first European king to go on crusade to the Holy Land. He did not lose any battles. The Norwegian crusade seems to have been similar to earlier Viking raids.


Jumping spider

Jumping spiders belong to the family "Salticidae". These spiders catch their prey by jumping on them.

Species live in many habitats, from leaves lying on the ground, to the tops of trees in the forest, and even way up on Mt. Everest. They are found on every continent in the world except for Antarctica. 

At present, 5026 species in 530 genera have been found. They are actually the largest family of spiders, with about 13% of all species.

They are easy to identify because their eye pattern is distinctive. They have eight eyes, two of which are very large, and because their faces form a flat surface, facing where they are going.

They often hunt high up in bushes, or on vertical walls. To save themselves from falling they do something very much like what climbers do to protect themselves in the mountains. Humans tie a rope to the mountain and attach the other end to the harness they wear. Jumping spiders attach silk from their spinnerets to the thing on which they are standing and then they jump. While they are moving through the air they make silk so that there is always a safety rope trailing out behind them. 

Jumping spiders can jump long distances for their size, as much as 16 cm. When they jump, they use their hind legs. They raise their front legs to be ready to grab their prey.

Many other kinds of spider hunt at night, but jumping spiders depend on their eyes, so they like to come out in the daytime. Often they will find a sunny spot on a wall or tree trunk.

There are however many variations, and many surprising aspects. For one thing, Salticids do not necessarily follow a straight path in approaching prey. They may follow a circuitous course, sometimes even a course that takes the hunter through places where the prey is not visible. Such complex behaviour is hard to reconcile with an organism that has such a tiny brain. Some spiders in species of "Portia" can take long detours from one bush down to the ground, then up the stem of another bush to capture a prey item on a particular leaf. Such behaviour is the subject of research.
Because they have good vision, jumping spiders can see human beings when they approach. Some jumping spiders may run away from approaching humans, and some do not. But either way a jumping spider will watch a nearby human being. When they do not run away, but do turn to keep watch over a human being, it may seem that they are interested in us. Some of them will even jump from where they are sitting on branches, rocks, etc. onto a person's finger or camera. These spiders only bite to get something to eat or to defend themselves, so if they jump on somebody's hand they will not bite. People might get bitten if they pinch or squeeze a jumping spider.

Jumping spiders are able to climb glass and other very smooth surfaces because besides having two claws on each foot they also have sticky hairs (called "scopulae") that hold onto the surface. Many tiny ends on each hair are held to the glass by Van der Waals forces, the force that will make two very flat sheets of glass stick tightly together without any glue.

Jumping spiders are able to see very clearly. Two of their eight eyes are very large and are complicated inside. The eyes cannot move, so the spider will often move its body to look at what it wants to see. However, it can also move the retinas of its two main eyes on the inside of the eye, so the center of the eye's picture can be moved. So the jumping spider has binocular vision.

Very few kinds of jumping spider make webs; instead they use their silk for their safety rope and also to make a kind of tent where they sleep at night, shed their skins (molt), lay their eggs, and enjoy a long sleep during winter (hibernate). Their silk comes out of their spinnerets (see diagram).

William Lipscomb

William Nunn Lipscomb, Jr. (December 9, 1919– April 14, 2011) was a Nobel Prize-winning American inorganic and organic chemist. He worked in nuclear magnetic resonance, theoretical chemistry, boron chemistry, and biochemistry.

Lipscomb was born in Cleveland, Ohio. His family moved to Lexington, Kentucky in 1920.He lived there until he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry at the University of Kentucky in 1941. Then he earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree in Chemistry from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1946.

From 1946 to 1959, he taught at the University of Minnesota. From 1959 to 1990, he was a professor of chemistry at Harvard University. After 1990, he became a professor emeritus at Harvard.

Lipscomb went to live in Cambridge, Massachusetts until his death in 2011 from pneumonia.

Lipscomb was one of the first people to use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study chemical structures. He learned out how to look at NMR data to find what atoms are connected together in a molecule. This is called "chemical shift".

Lipscomb studied molecules. These molecules included boron atoms. Lipscomb used this work to learn basic ideas about how atoms form chemical bonds. Lipscomb and his students created many important ideas in the field of theoretical chemistry. His work on boron compounds won a Nobel Prize in 1976. Three of his students went on to also win separate Nobel Prizes in Chemistry.

Lipscomb's later research was on the atomic structure of proteins. He studied how enzymes work. His group used x-ray diffraction to measure the three-dimensional structure of these proteins. He calculated the exact location of every single atom in these large molecules. Lipscomb then studied these details to learn how the molecules work in biological systems.
Carboxypeptidase A was the first protein structure from Lipscomb's group.

Five books and published collections of writings are dedicated to Lipscomb.


I Am Weasel

I Am Weasel (also spelled as I.M. Weasel because of the character) is an American animated television series produced by Cartoon Network Studios and Hanna-Barbera, created by David Feiss and aired on Cartoon Network. The show is about a very smart weasel named I.M. Weasel who uses his talents to help people in all different ways, and because of this is adored by everybody in the world. There is also a stupid baboon named I.R. Baboon who wants to be more admired than the weasel by trying to help people in his own way, but this often has bad results and makes everyone dislike him.

"I Am Weasel" was originally a series of segments in its sister series "Cow and Chicken", usually being aired as the third of three segments in a "Cow and Chicken" episode. The series started on July 15, 1997 and its first four seasons premiered in that format. In 1999, "I Am Weasel" was separated and got its own half-hour show, premiering as an independent series on June 10, 1999. All of the 52 episodes of "I Am Weasel" that originally aired on "Cow and Chicken" began to air in the new independent show, and were later joined by a fifth season with 27 new episodes, for a total of 79 episodes. The series ended in 2000.


Hella Haasse

Hélène "Hella" Serafia Haasse (2 February 1918 – 29 September 2011) was a Dutch writer. She was often called "the Grand Old Lady" of Dutch literature.

Many people think her greatest book is "Heren van de Thee" (The Tea Lords). It is famous in many countries around the world. In 1988 Haasse interviewed the Dutch Queen for her 50th birthday.

Haasse has received many awards for her writing. She received the Constantijn Huygens Prize in 1981 and the P. C. Hooft Award in 1984. She also won the Annie Romein Prize, the Dirk Martens Prize, and the Prize of the Public of the NS. She is the only author who has written for "Boekenweek" (Book Week) three times, in 1948, 1959 and 1994.

Many of Haasse's books have been translated into French. The Académie française gave Hasse an award called the "Diplôme de médaille Argent" in 1984. In 2000, she received another award. It was the "Officier dans l’Ordre de la Légion d'Honneur".

The Chilean Ministry of Education gave her a prize in 1996. In 1989 the city of Boston awarded her the Boston Certificate of Recognition for her book "In a Dark Wood Wandering". In 1992, Haasse went to the opening of the IKAPI International (Worldwide) Book Fair in Jakarta and visited Java, where she was born.

Derived demand

Derived demand is what happens when someone buys one thing which then makes someone need to buy something else as well. For example if someone bought a car then someone has to buy the metal that is used to build it. 

Pete Postlethwaite

Pete Postlethwaite OBE (7 February 1946 – 2 January 2011) was a British actor. In 1994, he was nominated for an Oscar for his part in "In the Name of the Father". He was also awarded an OBE by Queen Elizabeth II in 2003.

Postlethwaite was born in Warrington, Lancashire and died of pancreatic cancer in Shrewsbury, Shropshire.

Zwijndrecht, Netherlands

Zwijndrecht is a municipality in the province South Holland in the Netherlands. It is between the cities Rotterdam and Dordrecht.

In 2011, about 44,500 people lived there.

Zwijndrecht

Zwijndrecht is the name of two municipalities:

Kan'ichi Asakawa

He was born in Nihonmatsu, Japan. He studied at Waseda University in Tokyo.

In 1899, he earned a bachelor's degree (B.A.) at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. He continued his studies at Yale University. He earned a doctor's degree (Ph.D.) in 1902.

He lectured at Dartmouth in 1902. In 1906–1907, he was a professor at Waseda.

In 1907, Asakawa was appointed curator of the East Asian Collection at Yale's Sterling Memorial Library.

Asakawa was an instructor at Yale from 1907 through 1910 when became an assistant professor. He became the first Japanese professor at a major American university. He taught history at Yale for 35 years. Among those he influenced was John Whitney Hall.

Asakawa helped found Japan studies and Asian studies in the United States.

After the end of the Russo-Japanese War, Asakawa began to speak out against the growth of militarism in Japan. In 1941, he tried to prevent war between the US and Japan.

In an overview of writings by and about Kan'ichi Asakawa, OCLC/WorldCat includes roughly 110+ works in 220+ publications in 5 languages and 2,400+ library holdings.

His works also included contributions to the publications "Japan" edited by Frank Brinkley (1904); the "History of Nations Series" (1907); "China and the Far East" (1910); "Japan and Japanese-American Relations" (1912); and "The Pacific Ocean in History" (1917).

Asakawa lived most of his life in the United States. In the history of the Japanese-Americans, he is considered among the "Issei" who were immigrants born in Japan.

In 2007 the Asakawa Japanese garden at Yale, designed by Shinichiro Abe, was dedicated to mark the centennial of Asakawa's appointment as an instructor of history at Yale.




OPERA experiment

The Oscillation Project with Emulsion-tRacking Apparatus (OPERA) is a scientific experiment for detecting tau neutrinos from muon neutrino oscillations. The experiment is a joint effort between the European Centre for Nuclear Research (CERN) and the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS). In September 2011, OPERA scientists said that they had seen neutrinos appear to travel faster than the speed of light. However, the scientists later found problems in their equipment which had caused the anomaly. The neutrino time of flight was consistent with the speed of light.


Ian Nish

Ian Hill Nish CBE (born 3 June 1926) is a British academic, a specialist in Japanese studies, and Emeritus Professor of International History at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).
He is an expert on the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and Japanese foreign policy.

Nish was born in Edinburgh in 1926.

World War II gave opportunity to many young non-Japanese to become specialists in Japanese studies; and Ian Nish was one of them..

He studied at the School of Japanese Studies in Simla and Karachi in British India.

He earned a master's degree (M.A.) at the University of Edinburgh. He was awarded a doctorate degree (Ph.D.) at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London.

Nish taught in the history department of the University of Sydney from 1957 to 1962.

From 1962 through 1991, Nish taught at the London School of Economics in London. He retired in 1991.

In a statistical overview derived from writings by and about Ian Nish, OCLC/WorldCat includes roughly 200+ works in 300+ publications in 4 languages and 7,000+ library holdings.

Nish argues that "a foreign scholar of Japan is often only a middleman attempting to distill the ideas of Japanese scholars".


Reggaeton

Reggaeton is a form of urban music that first became popular with Latin American youths in the early 1990s. Reggaeton's predecessor originated in Panama as Reggae en Español. After the music's gradual exposure in Puerto Rico, it eventually evolved into reggaeton. It blends British West reggae and dancehall with Latin American genres, as well as hip hop. Modern reggaeton beats follow the structure of the Dem Bow Riddim, a beat created by Jamaican producers Steely & Clevie in the late 80s and early 90s. However, over the years, it has been losing every noticeable similarity with its original reggae origins.


First Kashmir War

The India-Pakistan War of 1947-48 is also known as the First Kashmir War. It was fought between the Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan over the former Princely state of Kashmir and Jammu from 1947 to 1948. 

This was the first of four wars fought between the two newly independent nations. The war initially begun as a rebellion by the mainly Muslim Pahari rebels in western Kashmir against the mainly Hindu Dogra rulers of the Jammu and Kashmir state and it turned into a full fledged war between India and Pakistan. The result of the war still affects the geopolitics of both the countries. The result of the war was inconclusive. However, neutral assessments seem to agree that India was the victor of the war because it was able to successfully defend about two-thirds of the Kashmir, including Kashmir valley, Jammu and Ladakh.

Indo-Pakistani War of 1965

The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 was a war that took place between April 1965 and 23 September 1965 between Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Republic of India. This conflict became known as the Second Kashmir War. Both countries fought over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir. The first Kashmir War took place in 1947. The war began after Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar. In this operation, Pakistan wanted to bring forces into Indian-held Jammu and Kashmir to conquer the area of Kashmir ruled by India. The five-week war caused thousands of deaths on both side. Ceasefire was declared through UNSC (United Nations Security Council) Resolution 211. The Tashkent Declaration was signed between India and Pakistan on 10 January 1966 to resolve the war .

The war was fought on the western front after Pakistan launched "Operation Gibraltar" - a covert offensive in which up to 30,000 fighters were pushed across the ceasefire line into Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir. India retaliated by crossing the international border at Lahore. At midnight on 6 September, India crossed the international border between India and Pakistan and attacked Lahore and Kasur. The Pakistan Army and Air Force prepared for war in a hurry and started attacks on India. The attacks also started in the areas of Jammu and Kashmir. The war was fought on the border until 22 September when UN asked for ceasefire. Pakistan army had to face very heavy causalities.

The war affected a lot of people and the thousands of Pakistani families had to leave their house and belongings and move to safer areas because of India's capture of Lahore.

It has been a real confusion on who won the war. Both nations believe it has been won by them but no one is sure who really won the war.
Individuals in the Pakistani establishment bureaucracy and army believed that Pakistan was victorious, or believed it should be promoted as such. In Pakistan, it is celebrated as a public holiday known as Defense Day on 6 September.


Nusrat Bhutto

Begum Nusrat Bhutto (, , March 23, 1929 – October 23, 2011) was an Iranian-Pakistani who was the former First Lady of Pakistan and widow of former Prime Minister of Pakistan Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. She became her husband's successor as the chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) from 1979 to 1983. The couple had four children: PPP chairman and the first and only female Pakistani Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto (1953-2007), Murtaza Bhutto (1954-1996), Sanam Bhutto (born 1957) and Shahnawaz Bhutto (1958-1985). She died on October 23, 2011.

Japan studies

Japanese studies (or Japanology) is a term generally used to describe the historical and cultural study of Japan. In North America, the academic field is usually referred to as Japanese studies. The term "Japanology" is more often used in Europe.

Japanology is the study of many subjects, including

The roots of Japanology begin with the Dutch at Dejima, Nagasaki in the Edo period.

Japanology was encouraged by the Asiatic Society of Japan at Yokohama which was established in 1872.







Blind Fool Love

Blind Fool Love is a post-hardcore Italian band, made in Toscana, Italy in 2005. In 2007 the band released their first demo, followed by the EP "Il pianto" in May 2011. The first studio album is called "La strage di Cupido" and was released in September 27, 2011, by Sony Music.





Codelco

Codelco-Chile () is a state mining company in Chile that uses and exploits copper.

It was founded in 1955 like the "Copper Office". In 1966, under President Eduardo Frei Montalva, the Copper Office changes the name to "Copper Corporation of Chile (Codelco)". It was nationalized on July 11, 1971 under Salvador Allende. In 1976 was created the "Corporación Nacional del Cobre de Chile" under the Augusto Pinochet administration.

Considering the size of installations and volume of production, it is considered one of the largest mining companies in the world.



Planet Dinosaur

Planet Dinosaur is a six-part documentary television series produced by the BBC, narrated by John Hurt, first aired in the United Kingdom in 2011, produced by VFX studio Jellyfish Pictures. It is the first major dinosaur-related series for BBC One since "Walking with Dinosaurs". There are more than 50 different prehistoric species featured, and they and their environments were created entirely as computer-generated images, for only a third of the production cost that was needed a decade earlier for "Walking with Dinosaurs". By the time the third episode aired, the companion book to the series was released accompany it. The DVD will be released after the series finishes.

CBBC aired a spin-off, "Planet Dinosaur Files", from 29 September, 2011, hosted by Jem Stansfield. Each episode compares three Mesozoic creatures and involves practical tests to replicate certain behaviours in an attempt to find out which creature holds a certain title, such as the "most powerful" theropod.

Tom Sutcliffe in the "Independent" found that it was visually "polished and jazzed up" but that the "knowledge and science generally take second place to B-movie spectacle".


Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011

On July 28, 2011, the United States House Judiciary Committee passed the Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011 (HR 1981). The bill passed by a vote of 19-10. Next the bill will be discussed in the House of Representatives. Some people are against this bill because it gives a lot of access to personal information. Some people have said that the bill will not become a law, but the Congressional Budget Office put out a report on October 12, 2011, with the cost of making the changes in the bill. The next step is that the bill will be discussed in the House of Representatives.

On May 25, 2011, Representative Lamar Smith of Texas introduced the bill. It was co-sponsored by 25 other Representatives of the House. On July 28, 2011 the bill was passed by the House Judiciary Committee. It has to go through more approvals before it becomes a law.

The purpose of the bill is to protect children. The bill would give the police more access to information in order to find and catch people who make and/or distribute child pornography.

This bill would create laws that give bigger punishments for people charged with child pornography. The bill also makes companies that people in the United States get internet service from (internet service providers or ISPs) keep records of all of their customers' internet use for twelve months. They would have to keep this information in case it needs to be used to investigate people.

On October 12, 2011 a report on the costs of the bill was released. This report said that the cost to the government would be very small and that the internet service companies would have to pay more than $200 million. That money includes the cost of storing the extra information about their customers.

Some say that because of the Patriot Act, this law could mean that people could lose some of their civil rights. Representative Zoe Lofgren, (D-Calif.) is very against the bill and asked for it to be renamed the "Keep Every American's Digital Data for Submission to the Federal Government Without a Warrant Act." She believes that people will have a lot less privacy if this is passed.

People who are in favor of the bill say that the police and other law enforcers need to be able to go back and look at the records of IP addresses, because these addresses can change over time. So the police need to be able to check the records in order to catch people. occurred. Lamar Smith, the bill's sponsor, said that: ""Some Internet service providers currently retain these [IP] addresses for business purposes. But the period of retention varies widely among providers, from a few days to a few months. The lack of uniform data retention impedes the investigation of Internet crimes." Smith said that the number of child pornography cases grew by 150% a year every year for the past ten years.

Aishwarya Rai Bachchan

Aishwarya Rai Bachchan (born 1 November 1973) is an Indian actress. She won the Miss World 1994 pageant. Her acting has made her one of the most popular celebrities in India. She has won many awards, including two Filmfare Awards.

Mariner 9

Mariner 9 was a NASA spacecraft. It was the ninth spacecraft in the Mariner programme. It was sent to study and orbit the planet Mars. It was the first spacecraft to orbit another planet. Mariner 9 was launched on May 30, 1971 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Mariner 9 reached Mars on November 13, 1971, after a ~170 day flight. The spacecraft was sent to map 70 % of the surface of Mars and to study the temperature changes of the Martian atmosphere and surface. When it arrived, a dust storm hid the surface of Mars. After a few months the dust settled and Mariner 9 discovered the Valles Marineris.

Flemming Jørgensen

Flemming "Bamse" Duun Jørgensen (7 February 1947 – 1 January 2011) was a Danish pop singer and actor. He was the lead singer of the band Bamses Venner () and also released solo albums. As an actor he received a Robert Award for best male supporting actor in 1986 for the movie "Ofelia kommer til byen" (). Jørgensen died of a cardiac arrest on New Year's Day in 2011.


William George Aston

William George Aston (9 April 1841 – 22 November 1911) was a British diplomat, author and scholar-expert in the language and history of Japan and Korea.

Aston was born near Londonderry in Ireland. In 1859-1863, he studied at Queen's College in Belfast, which is now Queen's University Belfast.

Aston was an interpreter in the British Legation in Japan in 1864. He studied with Ernest Mason Satow. 

Aston worked in the British consular service in Tokyo, Kobe and Nagasaki. He retired in 1889. 

Along with Satow and Basil Hall Chamberlain, Aston was one of three major British Japanologists during the 19th century.

Aston was the first translator of the "Nihongi" into the English language (1896).

Emperor Junna

Before he became the monarch, this prince's personal name ("imina") was .

Junna had six Empresses and Imperial consorts and 13 Imperial sons and daughters. 

Junna was Crown Prince for 13 years.





According to the Imperial Household Agency, the mausoleum ("misasagi") of Junna is in Nishikyō-ku, Kyoto. The emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine at this location.

The years of Junna's reign are identified by more than one era name ("nengō").


Stye

Styes (), also hordeolum () are infections at the base of a human eyelid or the eyelash. They are usually formed in the lids and are small red bumps; these styes can be either external or internal. Styes are small-sized and rather short in duration. They happen particularly often in infants, although people of all ages can get it. They're triggered by eye rubbing or poor nutrition. They often last four days under treatment to two weeks without.

Isaac Titsingh

Isaac Titsingh FRS (10 January 1745 in Amsterdam – 2 February 1812 in Paris) was a Dutch surgeon, scholar, merchant-trader and ambassador.

At Dejima Island in Japan, Titsingh was the head of the Dutch East India Company("Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie" or "VOC" in Dutch) during 1779-1780, 1781–1783, and 1784. In these years, the Japanese policy of seclusion of isolation ("sakoku") limited all contact with non-Japanese.
In this highly controlled context, the VOC traders became the sole official conduit for trade and for scientific-cultural exchanges between Japan and the West.

Titsingh is believed to have been the first Freemason in Japan.

In 1785, Titsingh was appointed Director of the VOC trading post at Chinsura in Bengal. He formed a friendship with William Jones, the philologist and Bengal jurist.

Titsingh’s return to Batavia (now Jakarta, Indonesia) led to new VOC positions as "Ontvanger-Generaal" (Treasurer) and later as "Commissaris ter Zee" (Maritime Commissioner).

In Batavia, Titsingh met with the British Ambassador do China, Lord Macartney who was travelling to the Imperial Court in Peking. Titsingh encouraged McCartney to abandon a planned expedition to Japan in 1793.

Titsingh was appointed Dutch Ambassador to the court of the Emperor of China. He was in Peking for the celebrations of the sixtieth anniversary of the reign of the Qianlong Emperor. In Peking, the Titsingh delegation included Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest and Chrétien-Louis-Joseph de Guignes.

Titsingh is believed to have been the first Freemason in China. and the only to be received personally in the court of the Qianlong emperor.

Among the Japanese books brought to Europe by Titsingh, was a copy of by Hayashi Shihei (1738–93). This book, which was published in Japan in 1785, deals with Chosen (Korea) and the kingdom of Ryukyu (Okinawa) and Ezo (Hokkaido). In Paris, the text represented the first appearance of Korean han'gŭl in Europe.

Titsingh died in Paris (February 2, 1812), and he is buried in Père-Lachaise cemetery.

After Titsingh's death, the printed original and Titsingh's translation were purchased by Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat (1788–1832) at the Collège de France.

In 1832, Julius Klaproth (1783-1735) at the "Institut Royal" publish his edited version of Titsingh's translation.

In a statistical overview derived from writings by and about Seki Takakau, OCLC/WorldCat includes roughly 90+ works in 150+ publications in 7 languages and 1,600+ library holdings.



Morrison Formation

The Morrison Formation is a geological formation laid down in the Upper Jurassic. It is a distinctive sequence of sedimentary rock in the western United States, and is named after Morrison, Colorado. It has been the most fertile source of dinosaur fossils in North America. 

It is composed of mudstone, sandstone, siltstone and limestone. Its colour is light grey, greenish gray, or red. Most of the fossils occur in the green siltstone beds and lower sandstones, relics of the rivers and floodplains of the Jurassic period.

The formation is in Wyoming and Colorado, with outcrops in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Idaho. Equivalent rocks under different names are found in Canada. It covers an area of 1.5 million square km (600,000 square miles), although only a tiny fraction is exposed and accessible to geologists and paleontologists. Over 75% is still buried under the prairie to the east and much of the rest was destroyed by erosion as the Rocky Mountains rose to the west.

The first fossils were discovered by Arthur Lakes in 1877. That same year, it became the center of the Bone Wars, a fossil-collecting rivalry between early paleontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope. 

In Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, the Morrison Formation was a major source of uranium ore.

According to radiometric dating, the Morrison Formation dates from 156.3 ± 2 million years old at its base, to 146.8 ± 1 million years old at the top, which places it in the later Jurassic. This is similar in age to the Solnhofen Limestone Formation in Germany and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania. Throughout the western USA, it lays over the Middle Jurassic Summerville, Sundance, Bell Ranch, Wanakah, and Stump Formations.

At the time, the supercontinent of Laurasia had recently split into the continents of North America and Eurasia, although they were still connected by land bridges. North America moved north and was passing through the subtropical regions.

The area was low-lying, and sediments were laid down in rivers, lakes, shallow water of various kinds. The details varied from time to time. 

The Morrison Basin, which stretched from New Mexico in the south to Alberta and Saskatchewan in the north, was formed when the early pre-Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. Streams and rivers in the east-facing drainage basin swept sediment down from the heights. The sediment was dropped in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels and floodplains. In the course of time, this became the Morrison Formation.

In the north, the Sundance Sea, an extension of the Arctic Ocean, stretched through Canada down to the United States. Coal is found in the Morrison Formation of Montana, which means that the northern part of the formation, along the shores of the sea, was wet and swampy, with much vegetation. Aeolian, or wind-deposited sandstones are found in the southwestern part, which indicates it was much more arid — a desert, with sand dunes.

Dinosaur National Monument is a National Monument on the southeast flank of the Uinta Mountains on the border between Colorado and Utah at the confluence of the Green and Yampa Rivers. The "Dinosaur Quarry" is in Utah just to the north of the town of Jensen, Utah. This park has fossils of dinosaurs including "Allosaurus", "Abydosaurus" (a nearly complete skull, lower jaws and first four neck vertebrae of the specimen DINO 16488 was found here) and various long-neck, long-tail sauropods. 

The dinosaur fossil beds (bone beds) were discovered in 1909 by Earl Douglass, a paleontologist working and collecting for the Carnegie Museum. He and his crews excavated thousands of fossils and shipped them back to the museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for study and display. President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed the dinosaur beds as Dinosaur National Monument in 1915. The monument boundaries were expanded in 1938 from the original tract surrounding the dinosaur quarry in Utah, to its present extent of over 200,000 acres (800 km²) in Utah and Colorado, including the spectacular river canyons of the Green and Yampa.

The roster of dinosaurs from the Morrison is impressive. Among the theropods, "Allosaurus", "Saurophaganax", "Torvosaurus", "Ceratosaurus", "Coelurus", "Ornitholestes", "Tanycolagreus", "Stokesosaurus", and "Marshosaurus" are found in the Morrison. An abundance of sauropods has been found there, including "Apatosaurus", "Diplodocus", "Barosaurus", "Brachiosaurus", "Camarasaurus", and "Amphicoelias", which is possibly the largest known dinosaur ever to exist. Two genera of stegosaurs, "Stegosaurus" and "Hesperosaurus", have been found there. Finally, ornithopods found in the Morrison include "Dryosaurus", "Camptosaurus", "Drinker", "Othnielia", and "Othnielosaurus".

Ichinobe-no Oshiwa

No firm dates can be assigned to the lives or reigns of this period, but the reign of Emperor Ankō is considered to have lasted from 456 to 479; and Oshiwa died during Ankō's reign.

According to the "Nihonshoki", Oshiwa was killed in a hunting accident by Emperor Yūryaku. His sons were adopted as heirs by Emperor Seinei. They are known as Prince Woke (or Kenzō"-tennō") and as Prince Oke (or Ninken"-tennō").

Dinosaur Ridge

Dinosaur Ridge is part of the Morrison Formation, just west of Denver.

The Dinosaur Ridge area is one of the world's most famous dinosaur fossil localities. In 1877, some of the best-known dinosaurs were found here, including "Apatosaurus", "Diplodocus", "Stegosaurus", and "Allosaurus". 

In 1973, the area was recognized for its uniqueness as well as its historical and scientific significance when it was designated the Morrison Fossil Area National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service. In 1989, the Friends of Dinosaur Ridge formed to address increasing concerns regarding the preservation of the site and to offer educational programs on the area's resources.

The rocks on the west side of Dinosaur Ridge are part of the widespread Morrison Formation of Jurassic age. It is in these rocks, where Arthur Lakes discovered the dinosaur bones in 1877. Fifteen quarries were opened along the Dakota hogback in the Morrison area in search of these fossils.

The rocks on the east side of Dinosaur Ridge are part of the Cretaceous Dakota Formation. When Alameda Parkway was being constructed in 1937 to provide access to Red Rocks Park, workers discovered hundreds of dinosaur footprints. These were found to include mostly "Iguanodon"-like footprints. Carnivorous theropod tracks are also present.

The site features the Dinosaur Ridge Exhibit Hall with displays about the dinosaurs found at the site. Additionally, Dinosaur Ridge has interpretive signs at trail locations that explain the local geology, a volcanic ash bed, trace fossils, paleo-ecology, economic development of coal, oil and clay, and many other geologic and paleontological features.


Galaxy Nexus

The Galaxy Nexus is a smartphone made by Google and Samsung, using the Android operating system. The phone started being sold on November 17, 2011.

The Galaxy Nexus is designed to be a developer-friendly phone. It is very easy to unlock and root. To unlock the bootloader, boot the phone into fastboot mode by holding down both volume keys while powering the phone on, and connect the phone to a computer with the Android SDK installed and run the command "fastboot oem unlock". This is in contrast to most other mobile phones which are designed to be difficult to unlock. This phone uses NFC, which allows it to communicate wirelessly with other Android devices.

Mariner program

The Mariner program was a program of spacecraft launched by NASA between 1963 and 1973. The spacecraft studied the planets Mars, Venus and Mercury. There were 10 spacecraft in the Mariner programme, named Mariners 1-10. Seven were successful but three were lost. The program included spacecraft doing things that spacecraft had never done before. These things included the first planetary fly-by, the first pictures from another planet, the first planetary orbiter, and the first gravity assist maneuver. Other spacecraft in the Mariner program were planned but they were changed into other spacecraft with different names. For example, Mariner 11 and Mariner 12 were planned but changed into Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.

Pouzolles

Pouzolles () is a commune in the Hérault department and Occitanie in southern France.

The village has a small collection of shops (bakery, superette, tobacconist) and several "chambres d'hôtes". There are other activities, such as a post office, a nearby paintball, a seasonal gallery and of course the local wine industry.





Harima Province

, also known as , was an old province of Japan in area of Hyōgo Prefecture on the island of Honshū.

The province had borders with the provinces of Tajima, Tamba, Settsu, Bizen, and Mimasaka.

The provincial capital city was Himeji on the Ishikawa River.

In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. The maps of Japan and Harima Province were reformed in the 1870s.

"Iwa jinja" was the chief Shinto shrine ("ichinomiya") of Harima.


Communauté de communes Coteaux et Châteaux

The Communauté de communes Coteaux et Châteaux was a group of communes in the Hérault departement and Languedoc-Roussillon region of France.

It was created on December 31, 1997, by decision of the Prefecture, and dissolved on January 1, 2013 upon merging with surrounding "communauté de communes" to form the Communauté des communes des Avant-Monts du Centre Hérault.

The name comes from the local "coteaux" (vineyards) and "chateaux" (castles), prominent features of the countryside.

"Coteaux et Chateaux" contained the following communes:



Lord of the Flies

Lord of the Flies is a novel written by William Golding. It was published in 1954. The title is a literal translation of Beelzebub, a Semitic deity which was worshipped in the Philistine city of Ekron.

Golding based this novel on two personal experiences: his time teaching at boys' public schools and his experiences in World War II. He had read books like "Coral Island" which showed young boys getting stranded on desert islands and living in perfect Utopia. He wanted to write about what he thought would really happen in this situation.

The book portrays their descent into savagery. Left to themselves, far from modern civilisation, the well-educated children revert to a primitive state.

The central theme is the conflicting human impulses toward civilization living by rules, peacefully and in harmony and toward the will to power. Themes include the tension between groupthink and individuality, between rational and emotional reactions, and between morality and immorality. How these play out is the story of Lord of the Flies.

A group of boys of different ages, from different schools and backgrounds, are stranded on an island after their plane is brought down. The country they came from has been hit with a atom bomb and all the adults on their plane have died. There is no one else on the island and no one knows where they are. On Piggy's advice, Ralph blows a conch shell to gather the boys from across the island to a meeting. There they are introduced to Merridew (Jack) who is head of the Choir and various other characters.

A vote is called for leader, which is won by Ralph. He gives the task of registering the boys to Piggy, while he, Jack and Simon (a member of the choir) go to explore the island. They discover that they are truly alone on the island and that it is an island. On the way back they walk through a the forest and come across a pig. Jack pulls out a knife and makes to kill it, but is unable to. He swears to kill the next one he finds.

The three return to the beach where the first meeting was held and discover that Piggy was unable to take the register. During a meeting concerns are raised by one of the younger children about a "beastie" or "snake-thing". Ralph and the other older boys are quick to dismiss this theory. All the same, fear from some of the younger boys spreads. Ralph suggests that they build a signal fire; the group is instantly excited by this idea and rush to the top of the mountain to pile wood. They discover they have no way of igniting it, then Piggy arrives with the conch (essential for meetings, whoever has the conch talks). They use his glasses to start a fire which burns well, then ignites a large portion of forest, possibly killing a young child.

Jack and half of his choir hunt while the other half is assigned to tending the signal fire. Jack becomes obsessed with the idea of a kill while Ralph is still more interested in building shelters (with Simon's help) and escaping the island, something Jack does not seem bothered about anymore. He wants to kill a pig.

Jack eventually gets angry with Ralph and goes and forms his own tribe. They steal Piggy's glasses so they can start a fire. Simon is killed by the boys because they thought he was the beast. Only Ralph, Piggy and Sam and Eric are left in the original tribe. They go to the top of the mountain where Jack's tribe are. Jack and Ralph fight and Roger sends a boulder tumbling down that narrowly misses Ralph but kills Piggy and breaks the Conch. Sam and Eric are taken by Jack's tribe and Ralph runs away. Ralph goes up to the mountain again to see Sam and Eric and they tell him that Jack plans on hunting him down. He goes and hides but is soon found by the tribe. A fire is created to smoke him out. He runs for it down onto the beach being chased by the tribe holding spears. Ralph runs into a navy officer who saw the smoke from the fire and has come to rescue them. It is ironic because Jack only wanted to hunt for food and not bother keeping the fire going but he ends up starting the fire that gets them rescued...

Child support

Child support is continued payment performed by a parent for the financial benefits of children following marital separations, divorces or ends of civil unions. Child maintenance is paid either directly or indirect by obligors toward an obligee for care and support of children from terminated marriages, civil unions or other relationships. The obligor is the non-custodial parent; the obligee is either the custodial parent, a caregiver, a guardian or the state.

Support orders end based on local laws and the facts of each case. Support orders usually end when the child reaches the age of majority. (This can be an age from 16 to 21 (New York State) or graduates from high school.) Some countries and states have laws that make support continue past the age of majority if the child is enrolled as a full-time, degree-seeking post-secondary student. If the obligor owes back child support, the payments must continue until the debt is satisfied, regardless of the age of the child.

Several factors can end a support order for a child under the age of majority. These include the child's marriage, legal emancipation or death.


Emperor Ninmyō

Before he became the monarch, this prince's personal name ("imina") was . 

Ninmyō was the second son of Emperor Saga and the Empress Tachibana no Kachiko. 

Ninmyō had nine Empresses, Imperial consorts, and concubines ("kōi"); and he had 24 Imperial sons and daughters.

Ninmyō was Crown Prince for 10 years.





Emperor Ninmyō is traditionally venerated at his tomb; the Imperial Household Agency designates , in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, as the location of Ninmyō's mausoleum.

Ninmyō was sometimes posthumously referred to as "the Emperor of Fukakusa," because that was the location of his tomb.

The years of Ninmyō's reign are identified by more than one era name ("nengō").



Natural deduction

Natural deduction is a branch of mathematical logic developed in Poland in the 1920s and 30s. It is meant to express inference rules closely related to the "natural" way of reasoning.

Spurred on by a series of seminars in Poland in 1926 by Łukasiewicz that advocated a more natural treatment of logic, Jaśkowski made the earliest attempts at defining a more natural deduction. In 1929 he first suggested in 1929 using a diagrammatic notation, and later updated his proposal in papers in 1934 and 1935. 



John McCarthy

John McCarthy (September 4, 1927 – October 24, 2011) was an American scientist. He is mostly known for the work he did in the field of logic. 

McCarthy was the first to use the term artificial intelligence, in an article he wrote in 1955. He invented LISP to be able to do logic programming, in 1958. This makes LISP the second-oldest high-level programming language that is still in use; FORTRAN is older. McCarthy studied mathematics. He invented Garbage collection to solve some of the problems LISP had. McCarthy's work received many awards, the Turing Award for his work on Artificial Intelligence, in 1971, or the National Medal of Science in 2003 are among them.

Hurricane Karl (2010)

Hurricane Karl was the fifth and final major hurricane of 2010's Atlantic hurricane season. It became the most damaging hurricane to ever impact the Mexican state of Veracruz. As of September 23, 22 people have been confirmed killed, most of which were in the state of Veracruz. Preliminary losses from the storm are estimated at 70 billion MXN ($5.6 billion USD). Despite the destruction, the name Karl was not retired.


Robert Pierpoint

Robert Pierpoint (May 16, 1925 – October 22, 2011) was an American broadcast journalist who worked for CBS.
He was born in Redondo Beach, California. Pierpoint served in the United States Navy during World War II. In 1948, he graduated from University of Redlands. Pierpoint covered the Korean War. He appeared on the first edition of "See It Now" in 1951. He also covered the State Department for CBS. He was often on Charles Kuralt's "Sunday Morning" broadcasts until his retirement. 
He learnt many of his radio and television skills from Edward R. Murrow, and was known as one of Murrow's boys. He is also remembered for playing himself, on the radio, in the final episode of "M*A*S*H."
Pierpoint served as White House correspondent for six presidents, from Eisenhower to Carter. His wrote about this in his book, "At the White House" (1981). He was known for his verbal sparring with President Richard Nixon. He died in Santa Barbara, California, in 2011.

One time, Pierpoint was playing tennis when he was called to go on the air. He gave his report wearing a suit coat, tie, and tennis shorts. The television image showed only his chest and above. But a photograph was taken that showed his legs. To recall this incident, Pierpoint's wife said that he will be buried wearing a suit coat and tennis shorts.

Emperor Montoku

His reign started in 850 and ended in 858.

Before he became the monarch, this prince's personal name ("imina") was . He was also known as "Tamura-no-mikado" or "Tamura-tei".

He was the eldest son of Emperor Ninmyō.

Montoku had six Imperial consorts and 29 Imperial sons.

Before he became the monarch, he was Crown Prince for 8 years.

According to the Imperial Household Agency, the mausoleum ("misasagi") of Montoku is in Kyoto. The emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine at this location. The site is formally named "Tamura no misasagi".

The years of Montoku's reign are identified by more than one era name or "nengō".


Xavier Tondo

Xavier Tondo Volpini (5 November 1978 – 23 May 2011) was a Spanish professional bicycle racer. He mainly participated in bicycle races up the mountain.

On 23 May 2011, while he was getting his bicycle ready for a ride, Tondo was trapped between his own garage door and car. He was crushed by the door. One of his teammates, Beñat Intxausti, was with him during the accident.


Edmundo Ros

Edmundo Ros OBE FRAM (7 December 1910 – 21 October 2011), born Edmund William Ross, was a Trinidadian-Venezuelan musician, vocalist, arranger and bandleader who made his career in Britain.

Ros's music featured three main types of music: Cuban music, Brazilian music and Caribbean calypsos. Of these genres, Cuban music was the most varied: it included the conga, the ballroom rumba, the mambo, and the cha-cha-cha. Ros introduced the Brazilian samba to England, and it became hugely popular. His "Wedding Samba" sold three millions copies on 78rpm. He was very popular during the 1950s and 60's.

The orchestrations for his band were designed to smooth the rough edges of Latin music. Ros emphasised the melodic aspects of the music, which he felt was necessary for his audiences. This is something he talked about after his retirement.

He was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad in 1910. He was brought up in Venezuela and went to a military college when he was 18. He learned to play the saxophone, euphonium and the drums. He played with the Venezuelan State Opera, and then won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music in London. He studied to be a conductor at the college in 1937. To earn extra money he played on recordings by other people, including Fats Waller, before starting his own band.

During the war he continued with his music, but also worked as an ambulance driver. After the war he opened the "Edmundo Ros Dinner and Supper Club". He recorded more than 50 albums, the most successful was "Rhythms Of the South" (Decca 1958), which sold more than a million copies.

He retired to Alicante, Spain in 1975, and made no more recordings. He received the OBE in 2000. He died in 2011 at the age of 100.

Liz Claiborne (fashion designer)

Anne Elisabeth Jane "Liz" Claiborne (March 31, 1929 – June 26, 2007) was a Belgian-born American fashion designer and entrepreneur.

Claiborne was born to American parents in Brussels, Belgium. She moved to New Orleans, Louisiana in 1939. She went on to found the clothing company, which was named Liz Claiborne, Inc. She was the first female CEO and chairperson of a Fortune 500 company. 

Claiborne died in New York City from cancer of the lining of the abdomen.


Liz Claiborne

Liz Claiborne, Inc. is a fashion company based in New York City and founded in 1976 by a fashion designer of the same name. The organization markets clothing and fragrances. In the 1980s it was the first company from a female to hit the "Fortune 500" mark.

The company was created by Liz Claiborne the person.

Electrical outlet

An electrical outlet or receptacle, frequently called a wall outlet, is a socket that connects an electrical device to an electricity supply. In buildings, electrical outlets are usually installed in the wall, although they can also be installed in the floor. Occasionally, they are found in the ceiling for powering devices such as garage door openers or neon signs in storefront windows. Different countries often have different outlet types and voltages. Adapters are available to convert between the different types.


Anemometer

An anemometer is a device used to measure wind speed. It is found in most weather stations. The word comes from the Ancient Greek word "ἄνεμος ", meaning "wind". It describes any airspeed measurement instrument used in meteorology or aerodynamics. Leon Battista Alberti described an anemometer for the first time around 1450.

Nuclear magnetic resonance

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is the physical phenomenon in which magnetic nuclei in a magnetic field absorb, then re-emit electromagnetic radiation. This energy is of a specific resonance frequency that depends on the magnetic field strength, and the magnetic properties of the isotopes of the atoms. Many scientific techniques use it to study molecular physics, crystals and non crystalline materials through NMR spectroscopy. NMR is also used for advanced medical imaging techniques, for example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

All isotopes that contain an odd number of protons and/or of neutrons (see Isotope) have an intrinsic magnetic moment and angular momentum, in other words a nonzero spin, while all nuclides with even numbers of both have a total spin of zero. The most commonly studied nuclei are H and C, although nuclei from isotopes of many other elements (e.g. H, Li, B, B, N, N, O, F, Na, Si, P, Cl, Cd, Xe, Pt) have been studied by high-field NMR spectroscopy as well.

A key idea of NMR is that the resonance frequency of a particular substance is directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field. This resonance is used in imaging techniques. If a sample is placed in a non-uniform magnetic field then the resonance frequencies of the sample's nuclei depend on where in the field they are located. Scientists try to use the highest possible magnetic fields to get the best image quality.

The principle of NMR usually involves two sequential steps: 

The constant field and the pulse field are usually set perpendicular to each other. This maximizes the NMR signal strength. The resulting response by the total magnetization (M) of the nuclear spins is what is used in NMR spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. Both use intense applied magnetic fields (H) in order to achieve dispersion and very high stability to deliver spectral resolution. Scientist explain their readings as chemical shifts, the Zeeman effect, and Knight shifts (in metals).

NMR is used in low-field NMR, NMR spectroscopy and MRI in the Earth's magnetic field (referred to as Earth's field NMR), and in several types of magnetometers.

Nuclear magnetic resonance was first described and measured in molecular beams by Isidor Rabi in 1938. In 1944, Rabi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this work. In 1946, Felix Bloch and Edward Mills Purcell expanded the technique for use on liquids and solids. They shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1952 for this discovery.

Purcell had worked on the development of radar during World War II at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Radiation Laboratory. His work during that project on the production and detection of radio frequency power and on the absorption of such RF power by matter laid the background for Rabi's discovery of NMR.

Rabi, Bloch, and Purcell noticed that magnetic nuclei, like H and P, could absorb RF energy when placed in a magnetic field of a strength specific to the identity of the nuclei. When this absorption occurs, the nucleus is described as being "in resonance". Different atomic nuclei within a molecule resonate at different (radio) frequencies for the same magnetic field strength. The observation of such magnetic resonance frequencies of the nuclei present in a molecule allows any trained user to discover essential, chemical and structural information about the molecule.

After World War II, the development of NMR as a technique in analytical chemistry and biochemistry happened at the same time as the development of electromagnetic technology and advanced electronics and their introduction into civilian use. In the 1960s, William Lipscomb was a pioneer in using NMR to study chemical structures. He worked out how to look at NMR data to tell what atoms are connected together in a molecule. This is called chemical shift.

Herbert A. Hauptman

Herbert Aaron Hauptman (February 14, 1917 – October 23, 2011) was an American mathematician. He won a Nobel Prize. He made a mathematical method to find a molecular structures based on the X-ray patterns of crystallized materials. With Jerome Karle, he won the 1985 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
He was born in New York City. He was the oldest child of Israel Hauptman and Leah Rosenfeld, and of Jewish descent.
Hauptman was interested in science and mathematics from an early age. He studied at Townsend Harris High School. He graduated from the City College of New York (1937). He earned an M.A. degree in mathematics from Columbia University in 1939. He married Edith Citrynell on November 10, 1940, and had two daughters.
After World War II, he began working together with Jerome Karle, a physical chemist, at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C.. He also enrolled in the Ph.D. program at the University of Maryland, College Park. They used their mathematics and physical chemistry skills to solve the phase problem of X-ray crystallography. By 1955, he had received his Ph.D. in mathematics, and they had worked out the direct methods in X-ray crystallography. Their 1953 article, "Solution of the Phase Problem I. The Centrosymmetric Crystal", contained the main ideas, the most important of which was the introduction of probabilistic methods.
In 1970 he joined the Medical Foundation of Buffalo, becoming its Research Director in 1972. At this time he developed the neighborhood principle and extension concept. These theories were further developed during the following years.

Hauptman who was an atheist, signed with 21 other Nobel laureates the Humanist Manifesto in 2003.


Viking program

The Viking program was a NASA mission that sent two spacecraft to the planet Mars. These spacecraft were called Viking 1 and Viking 2. Each spacecraft was made of an orbiter and a lander. The orbiters took pictures of Mars from their orbit and sent information to Earth. The landers gathered scientific data on the surface of the planet.

Both Viking spacecraft were launched in 1975 and both reached Mars in 1976. Scientists chose landing places for both landers from the pictures that the orbiters had taken. Then the landers were released from the orbiters and they went down to their landing places. The orbiters continued to take pictures while the landers studied the surface of the planet and did other things. All of the spacecraft, including both orbiters and both landers, kept working for longer than they had been planned to. Eventually, they broke down. Viking 2 Orbiter stopped working in 1978, Viking 1 Orbiter and Viking 2 Lander in 1980, and Viking 1 Lander in 1982.

The Viking program was the most expensive and difficult mission ever sent to Mars. The program cost a total of US$1 billion. The program was very successful. Most of the knowledge about Mars until the late 1990s came from the Viking mission.


Piculet

The piculets are a subfamily of small woodpeckers which are mostly in tropical South America, with just three Asian and one African species.

Like true woodpeckers, piculets have large heads, long tongues to get their insect prey and zygodactyl feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backwards. However, they lack the stiff tail feathers that woodpeckers use when climbing trees. They are more likely to perch on a branch rather than an upright trunk.

They eat insects and grubs mainly from decaying wood. They re-use woodpecker holes for nesting, rather than making their own holes. The eggs are white, as with many hole nesters.

There are 30 species in all. It is known that they split off from mainstream woodpeckers in the middle Miocene about 15 million years ago (mya). Splits between the three genera happened about 7.9 mya.

Typically these birds have grey or dull green upperparts and dark-streaked white underparts.

Fallin' for You

"Fallin' for You" is a song by the recording artist Colbie Caillat. The song was released June 29, 2009 as the lead single off her album "Breakthrough", which was also released in 2009. The lyrics speak of someone falling for a guy with whom they are friends.

Moulting

Moulting (or molting) is the manner in which an animal routinely casts off part of its body (usually the outer layer or covering) at particular times of year, or at specific points in its life cycle. Moulting is also known as sloughing, shedding, or for some species, ecdysis.

Moulting can involve the epidermis (skin), and hair, fur, wool, or other external layer. In some species, other body parts may be shed, for example, wings in some insects. Examples include old feathers in birds, old hairs in mammals (especially dogs and other canidae), old skin in reptiles, and the entire exoskeleton in arthropods.

In arthropods, such as insects, arachnids and crustaceans, moulting is the shedding of the exoskeleton (or shell). 

This process of moulting is called ecdysis. It is the defining feature of a whole group of invertebrates, the clade Ecdysozoa. This group includes the arthropods, nematodes, velvet worms, horsehair worms, rotifers, tardigrades and Cephalorhyncha. Since the cuticles of these animals often forms an inelastic exoskeleton, it is shed during growth and a new, larger covering is formed. Amongst fossils, trilobites and eurypterida used ecdysis. 

Ecdysis is part of the whole process of metamorphosis. The different stages (called 'instars') and the development of new 'apparatus' (such as sense organs) is necessary as the creature moves from one form to another. The new exoskeleton is initially soft but hardens after the moulting of the old exoskeleton. 

Detention (imprisonment)

Detention is depriving of liberty of a person by the authority of a government or a country, usually the police. Such depriving liberty is allowed only in the case that the person can considered to have committed a crime. Other depriving liberty is called arbitrary detention and prohibited by article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. And even if detention is done legally, the person must be treated with humanity and respected the person's dignity according to the Convention against Torture. 


Charles III of Spain

Charles III (20 January 1716 – 14 December 1788) was a king of Spain and the oldest son of Philip V and Elisabeth Farnese. He ruled Spain from 1759 until his death in 1788. After he died, his son, Charles IV, became king. He was also the king of Naples and Sicily from 1734 until 1759. In those places he was known as Charles VII of Naples and Charles V of Sicily. He was the builder of the Palace of Caserta as well as the Royal Palace of Madrid and the Real Albergo dei Poveri in Naples. 

Charles III grew up in Madrid. When he was 16 years old, he went to live in Parma, a city in Italy. He ruled that city, and the nearby city of Piacenza as their Duke from 1731 until 1734. In 1738 he married the Princess Maria Amalia of Saxony. They had 13 children. Only 8 of them lived to be adults.


Pope Paul V

Pope Paul V (; Rome, 17 September 1552 – 28 January 1621), born Camillo Borghese, was an Italian priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 234th Pope from 16 May 1605 until his death.

He was born in Rome. He was a son of the noble Borghese family of Siena.

In June 1596 he was made Cardinal.

Cardinal Borghese was elected pope in 1605; and he chose to be called Paul V.

Pope Paul was involved in Italian and European political disputes.

In October 1615, Paul V received a diplomatic mission from Japan. The embassy was led by Hasekura Tsunenaga.

Paul V financed work on the unfinished St. Peter's Basilica. He enlarged the Vatican Palace and Quirinale Palace, restored the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, constructed or repaired aqueducts. He also made additions to the Vatican library.

Paul V canonised Charles Borromeo and Frances of Rome. He beatified Ignatius Loyola, Philip Neri, Theresa of Avila and Francis Xavier.



Beavis and Butt-Head

Beavis and Butt-Head is an American adult animated television sitcom by Mike Judge which ran for 7 seasons from March 8, 1993 and ended on November 28, 1997 on MTV. In 1996 the series was adapted into a movie titled "Beavis and Butt-Head Do America". The eighth season was shown in 2011. The title characters are hard rock/heavy metal-loving teenagers from the fictional town of Highland, Texas.

In the show "Beavis and Butt-Head", Beavis and Butt-Head are unintelligent teenage boys who have a very lazy and naughty lifestyle. They are teenage deliquents (naughty teenagers) who are couch potatoes (lazy people who do little exercise), and have poor social skills. Beavis and Butt-Head go to school at Highland High in the fictional town of Highland, Texas. 

1. Oberndorfer Sportklub 1920

The 1.Oberndorf Sportklub 1920 (also known as Oberndorfer SK 1920) is a football club from Oberndorf, Salzburg, in Austria. The club is the oldest football club outside the city of Salzburg.

In March 1920, Hermann Rasp created the club. By 1921, they made the Salzburg football association. Before World War II Oberndorf played in different levels in Salzburg but they did not play during the war. In 1946, the club restarted again. The most successful years were the 1960s when the club played two times in the Tauern Liga which was then the second division in Austrian league system.

Since 1990 the club was part of the highest league in Salzburg. In 2007 they were relegated and the next season again. So they play in the 2011/12 season in the 1.class north. 2014 the were promoted and play in the 2. Landesliga (5th level)

Oberndorf is well known for its youth teams. Over 100 young players play in seven youth teams. Famous players who started their career in Oberndorf were Hermann Stadler, who played as professional for Austria Salzburg and Rapid Wien and Gerald Baumgartner who also played for Austria Salzburg and for Austria Wien in the Austrian Bundesliga.
At the beginning the club did not have a proper sports field. For years the game was played on the Viehmarktplatz, where football and livestock trading took place alternately. Around 1953 this place was no longer available. The club played in Bürmoos and Laufen . It was not until 1958 that a separate sports field was created, which is still the home of the OSK today.


Voynich manuscript

The Voynich manuscript is a manuscript named after Wilfrid Voynich who bought it in the early 20th century. The manuscript is made up of about 240 vellum pages, and was probably written in the early 15th century in northern Italy. Today, it is in the library of Yale University.

Many pages contain illustrations. Although many authors have been thought to have written this manuscript, the author remains unknown. The text is written in an unknown language, in an unknown writing system. It looks like there are no errors in the text. There are no corrections to it. The text is probably some ciphertext; many people working in cryptography have tried to break its code, both amateur and professional cryptographers. Much less attention has been given to the illustrations, which seem to show plants, anatomic or astronomic links. It has been described as "the world's most mysterious manuscript".

In 2009, University of Arizona researchers performed radiocarbon dating on the manuscript's vellum, which they say (with 95% confidence) was made between 1404 and 1438. In addition, the McCrone Research Institute in Chicago found that much of the ink was added not long afterwards, confirming that the manuscript is an authentic medieval document.

As the text has not been translated yet, it has been sectioned based on the images. The sectioning is usually the following:

The very last page seems to have some sort of "key": three lines of text, with a script resembling that used in 15th-century Germany.

The manuscript consists of quires. A quire is made of folded parchment. The quires consist of folios, with text or illustrations on both sides of the folio. The quires are numbered from 1 to 20, the folios from 1 to 116. Some of the fold-outs have unusual shapes. Depending on the way of counting, this gives a total of 240 pages. As there are gaps in the numbering, it seems likely that some pages were lost; the manuscript probably had at least 272 pages. The gaps were already there when Voynich bought the manuscript in 1912.

A quill pen was used for the text and figure outlines. The figures were colored with paint, possibly at a later date. There is strong evidence that many of the book's folios were reordered at various points in its history, and that the original page order may well have been quite different from what we see today.

The text is written from left to right, because there are irregular margins on the right. There is no obvious punctuation. The person or people writing the text seem to have been fluent in the language. There probably was another "source" they copied from. The flow of the text is smooth, which gives the impression that the symbols were not enciphered.

In total there are about 170,000 glyphs. Given the space between these, there seem to be "words" and "paragraphs". It is difficult (and a question of debate) to determine the alphabet used in the text; some glyphs may be variations of others, and some may simply be two glyphs joined. The text can probably be represented with an alphabet of between twenty and thirty characters.

There are about 35,000 "words", made of glyphs or characters. A statistical analysis has been done, and the "words" resemble "natural language":

The purpose of the book was probably to serve as a manual to make drugs, or as a book about medicine. The first section is almost certainly a herbal. A herbal is a collection of plants, with their description. An identification of the plants, based on the images has mostly failed, though. Two plants can be guessed, with some certainty: the Wild pansy and the Maidenhair fern. Many of the plant pictures are composite: they combine parts of plants; the root of one plant is added to the leaves of another; the flowers may be from a third species. The leaves and fruit of the Castor oil plant have been identified, as well.

Because of the tubes in the biological section, the text may be related to alchemy. This would also make sense, if the text was about making certain kinds of medicine. The problem with that theory is that alchemy books of the time all use a common set of motifs for their pictures; these motifs cannot be found in the manuscript.

Another idea is that the book is about astrology; practices common at the time, such as bloodletting were often connected with astrology. The problem with this approach is, that except for the signs of the zodiac, and one diagram possibly showing the classical planets, no one has shown that the symbols are found in other astrological traditions.

Fixed point

A value "x" is a fixed point of a function "f" if and only if "f"("x") = "x".
1 is a fixed point of formula_1 because formula_2. Some functions do not have fixed points. For example formula_3 does not have one because formula_3 is never equal to "x".

Emperor Seiwa

This prince's personal name ("imina") was before he became the monarch. In the Imperial House of Japan, Korehito was the first to have the suffix "-hito" 仁 in his name.

Korehito was the fourth son of Emperor Montoku. His mother was the daughter of Fujiwara no Yoshifusa (藤原良房), who was regent and great minister of the council of state.

Prince Korehito became emperor at the age of 8, but the real power was held by his grandfather, Yoshifusa.

The actual site of Seiwa's grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Kyoto. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Seiwa's mausoleum. It is formally named "Minooyama no misasagi". From the site of his tomb, he was sometimes referred to as Mizunoo (水尾).

The "kami" of Emperor Seiwa is venerated at Seiwa-tennō-sha in Saga, Yamashiro province.

The years of Seiwa's reign are identified by more than one era name or "nengō".


Standard ML

Standard ML is a functional programming language which is a dialect of ML (programming language). It is sometimes used for writing compilers and in theorem provers.
Here is an example of a factorial function written in a simple, non-tail recursive, style.

fun fac (0 : int) = 1 (* the : int part means that 0 and n are integers *)

Droste effect

The Droste Effect is the name for a picture which contains a smaller image of itself, which in turn contains a smaller image of itself, etc. It is named after an advertisement. It is an example of recursion. In art, this is known as mise en abyme. In theory, the recursion goes on forever, but in practice, the number of recursions is limited by the resolution of the image. In practice, there are few iterations, until the size falls below 1 x 1 = 1 px. The reason for this is that this is a geometric progression, and each iteration reduces the size of the image. It is a visual example of a strange loop, a self-referential system of instancing which is the cornerstone of fractal geometry.

Already Gone

"Already Gone" is a song by the recording artist Kelly Clarkson from her 2009 record "All I Ever Wanted". This was the third single from that album to be released. The song is about the breakup of a relationship. Its release was surrounded by controversy: Clarkson said the arrangement used for the song was strongly similar to the 2008 song "Halo" from singer Beyoncé and feared the public would say Clarkson had stolen it. Despite this, however, the song received strong praise from critics, and "Already Gone" became one of the highlights from "All I Ever Wanted". On the "Billboard" Hot 100 the single peaked at #13.

De Morgan's laws

In boolean algebra, DeMorgan's laws are the laws of how a NOT gate affects AND and OR statements:

They can be remembered by "break the line, change the sign".

The following truth tables prove DeMorgan's laws.

Tiberius Gracchus

Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus (163/162 BC- 133 BC) was an important Roman Tribune of the plebs. He proposed a reform called the "Lex Sempronia Agraria". This was meant to reduce the number of poor and homeless people by allowing the rich to have only a certain amount of land. The rest of the land would be given to homeless veterans of the Roman military. But the Roman Senate did not like his plan. They convinced another tribune, named Marcus Octavius, to oppose Tiberius Gracchus. Eventually, enough tension built up that some of the Senators beat Tiberius to death with their chairs and threw his dead body into the Tiber. Tiberius' death is seen as the first death caused by political problems in the Roman government.

Tiberius' brother, Gaius Gracchus, also tried to reform the Roman government and was also killed. Together, the two are called the Gracchi. Their attempts at reform had a lasting effect on Rome, because later on the Senate used some of the ideas from their reforms in their own laws.

A constrictor knot is a type of knot that is tied around another rope. It is a secure knot, but it can be difficult to untie after it is tightened.


Waiting to Exhale

Waiting to Exhale is a 1995 American romance movie. It came out in December 1995. The cast for the movie includes Angela Bassett and Whitney Houston. The movie is about four women who live in Phoenix, Arizona and their relationships with men. "Waiting to Exhale" is unusual because it has an all African-American cast.

Soho

Soho is an area of the City of Westminster and the West End of London. It is long established as an entertainment district. For much of the 20th century Soho had sex shops, prostitutes, jazz clubs, bars, night clubs, theatres and the movie industry. 

Since the early 1980s, the area has changed greatly: it has moved upmarket. It now is a fashionable district of expensive restaurants and media offices, with only a few sex industry venues. Some music venues survive, such as Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club. The area includes Carnaby Street, the centre of the 'Swinging London' fashion scene of the 1960s, and Wardour Street, a centre of the movie and entertainment industry.

Soho was never an administrative unit with formal boundaries. It is an area of about a square mile, bounded by Oxford Street to the north, Regent Street to the west, Leicester Square to the south and Charing Cross Road to the east. Apart from Oxford Street, all of these roads are 19th-century metropolitan improvements. 

The area to the west is known as Mayfair, to the north Fitzrovia, to the east St Giles and Covent Garden, and to the south St James's. According to the Soho Society, Chinatown, the area between Leicester Square to the south and Shaftesbury Avenue to the north, is part of Soho, although some consider it a separate area.

A significant event in the history of epidemiology and public health was Dr. John Snow's study of an 1854 outbreak of cholera in Soho. He identified the cause of the outbreak as water from the public water pump located at the junction of Broad Street (now Broadwick Street) and Cambridge Street (now Lexington Street), close to the rear wall of what is today the "John Snow" public house. 

John Snow mapped the addresses of the sick, and noted that they were mostly people whose nearest access to water was the Broad Street pump. He persuaded the authorities to remove the handle of the pump, thus preventing any more of the infected water from being collected. The spring below the pump was later found to have been contaminated with sewage. This is an early example of epidemiology, public health medicine and the application of science–the germ theory of disease.

Science writer Steven Johnson describes the 2006 appearance of places related to the Broad Street Pump cholera outbreak: 

A replica of the pump, with a memorial plaque and without a handle (to signify John Snow's action to halt the outbreak) was erected near the location of the original pump.

Soho is near the heart of London's theatre area, and is a centre of the independent movie and video industry as well as the television and movie 'post-production' industry. It is home to Soho Theatre, built in 2000 for new plays and stand-up comedy. The British Board of Film Classification, formerly known as the British Board of Film Censors, can be found in Soho Square.

Soho is criss-crossed by a rooftop telecommunication network, and below ground level with fibre optics making up Sohonet, which connects the Soho media and post-production community to British movie studios such as Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, and to other major production centres (such as Rome, New York City, Los Angeles, Sydney and Wellington, New Zealand.

There are also plans by Westminster Council to deploy high-bandwidth Wi-Fi networks in Soho as part of a programme to further encourage the development of the area as a centre for media and technology industries.


Herbert Art Gallery and Museum

Herbert Art Gallery and Museum is a is a museum, art gallery, archive, learning centre and creative arts facility in Jordan Well, Coventry, United Kingdom.

It is named after Sir Alfred Herbert, a local business owner who gave money for the original building. Work on it began in 1939, with an interruption by the Second World War, and The Herbert opened in 1960. In 2008 it reopened after a £20 million refurbishment.

It is free to get in and the museum in run by a charity. Its only income is from donations, sales at the museum shop, and hiring out the buildings the charity owns. In 2010, the museum had over 300,000 visitors. This makes it one of the most popular free tourist attractions in the West Midlands.


Zipf's law

Zipf's law is an empirical law, formulated using mathematical statistics, named after the linguist George Kingsley Zipf, who first proposed it. Zipf's law states that given a large sample of words used, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. So "nth" word has a frequency proportional to 1/"n".

Thus the most frequent word will occur about twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc. For example, in one sample of words in the English language, the most frequently occurring word, "the", accounts for nearly 7% of all the words (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf's Law, the second-place word "of" accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by "and" (28,852). Only about 135 words are needed to account for half the sample of words in a large sample.

The same relationship occurs in many other rankings, unrelated to language, such as the population ranks of cities in various countries, corporation sizes, income rankings, etc. The appearance of the distribution in rankings of cities by population was first noticed by Felix Auerbach in 1913. 

It is not known why Zipf's law holds for most languages.

Steve Jones

Stephen Philip "Steve" Jones (born 3 September 1955) is an English rock guitarist, best known as the guitarist and founding member of the punk rock band the Sex Pistols.

Peter Tatsuo Doi

Doi was born in Sendai. He studied in Rome.

Doi was ordained as a priest in 1921.

In 1934, he was made Secretary of the Apostolic Delegation to Japan.

He was named Bishop of Tokyo in 1937.

He was Apostolic Administrator of Roman Catholic Diocese of Yokohama from 1945 to 1947.

In 1960, Pope John XXIII created him Cardinal of Sant'Antonio da Padova in Via Merulana.

In 1965, Doi was among those who read the closing messages of the Second Vatican Council.


Stronger (Kelly Clarkson album)

Stronger is the fifth studio album by recording artist Kelly Clarkson. The album was releases on October 24, 2011. The hit single "Mr. Know It All" was released on September 5, 2011.

Henry Cooper

Sir Henry Cooper OBE KSG KB (3 May 1934–1 May 2011) was an English heavyweight boxer known for the power of his left hook. People called it "Enry's 'Ammer" (Henry's hammer). He knocked down Muhammad Ali early in Ali's career. Cooper held the British, Commonwealth and European heavyweight titles several times. He unsuccessfully challenged Ali for the world heavyweight championship in 1966. 

After he retired from boxing, Cooper was a television and radio personality. He was popular in Britain. He was the first (and is today one of just three people) to twice win the public vote for BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award. He is the only boxer to be awarded a knighthood. He is also named as one of the great Londoners in the "London Song" by Ray Davies on his 1998 album The Storyteller.

Cooper married an Italian Catholic woman and converted to her faith.

Morquio syndrome is a very rare inherited disease. It is called mucopolysaccharidosis because the body cannot break down mucopolysaccharides which make up mucous. It has very serious effects, but can be helped by a synthetic version of the enzyme which is not working. 

My Life Would Suck Without You

"My Life Would Suck Without You" is a song from American singer Kelly Clarkson. It was the first single from her fourth studio album, "All I Ever Wanted". It was her second number-one hit in Canada and the United States and her first chart-topper in the UK. This song was released on January 31, 2009.

The song has the largest jump to number one in "Billboard" Hot 100 history. It was also the biggest leap on the chart ever until 2019, when Taylor Swift broke this record. "My Life Would Suck Without You" entered at #97 and moved to the top the following week.

In 2017, in a radio interview with Z100 in New York City, Clarkson discussed Dr. Luke (who was involved in a lawsuit with singer Kesha for reported assault). She claimed:
Clarkson also said that she usually asks for writing credits if she knows she created a fair-sized portion of a song. She says she lost "millions" of dollars in royalties by not being listed on the writing credits of the song.

Cyclops (character)

Scott Summers (also known as Cyclops) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is a mutant and leader of the X-Men. He can shoot lasers from his eyes as his special power. He was in love with Jean Grey. He tried to save her while she was taken over by the Phoenix Force.

Scott Summers is a mutant. He was orphaned as a young boy when his parents died in a plane crash. He survived with his younger brother, Alex Summers. The two brothers were then separated and sent to orphanages. When he was a teenager, Scott was adopted by Charles Xavier, the founder of the X-Men and the headmaster of Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters (a school for mutants). Under Xavier, Scott learned to control his powers with special glasses, as Scott cannot control them by himself due to an injury he got in the plane crash. Xavier made Scott the first leader of the X-Men, which was made up of four other teenage mutants.

Scott Summers is the son of Christopher Summers, a pilot. He has two brothers, Alex and Gabriel. Scott did not know that he had a second brother for a long time. Scott has multiple children. They are all powerful mutants. His daughter's name is Rachel. She is from an alternate future and can move things with her mind. Scott has a son named Nathan Christopher, and there are multiple versions of him because of time travel. The most well-known version is Cable, a large man with a mechanical arm. The other well-known version is Nate Grey, who is from another alternate timeline.

Scott Summers has been in many romantic relationships. His most famous is with Jean Grey, a very powerful telepath and telekinetic. Jean is Rachel's mother. Jean and Scott have been married twice. Scott has also been married to a woman named Madelyn Pryor, a clone of Jean Grey. Scott did not know Madelyn was a clone when he married her. Madelyn is Nathan Christopher's mother, but Jean Grey helped raise him after Madelyn's first death. Scott has also been in a relationship with Emma Frost, another powerful mutant.

Scott has several close friends among the X-Men. Wolverine (also known as Logan) is one of Scott's best friends, but they tend to fight a lot over their different beliefs. Storm (also known as Ororo Munroe) is also very close with Scott. She has co-lead the X-Men with him many times. Scott considers many X-Men members to be like his family.

Scott is not friends with many superheroes outside of the X-Men because he is a mutant. The exception to this is the young team of heroes called the Champions, who befriended a teenage version of Scott who got pulled into his future for a short time. The adult version of Scott still sees the Champions as his friends in his present day.

Scott Summers has natural superpowers because he is a mutant. His mutant power is to be able to shoot powerful red beams out of his eyes. His beams can knock down large objects, but do not produce heat like a laser. Scott needs special glasses or a visor to control his beams because of a head injury. With his visor, Scott can change the size and power of his beams, from very wide and strong to very focused. Scott is also able to do complicated math in his head to know the angles he needs to bounce his beams just right. Outside of his mutant powers, Scott is a very good tactical leader and is good with children.

James Marsden initially portrayed Cyclops in the 20th Century Fox "X-Men" movies, while a younger version of the character was portrayed by Tim Pocock in the 2009 prequel movie "", and he was portrayed by Tye Sheridan in "" (2016) and "Dark Phoenix" (2019) as well as a cameo in "Deadpool 2" (2018).

In 2007 "Because of You" was reprised in a duet alongside the country music artist Reba McEntire; the reprised version produced the first appearance of Clarkson in the Billboard Hot Country charts, where the single hit Number 2.

Tawny owl

The tawny owl or brown owl ("Strix aluco") is a stocky, medium-sized owl commonly found in woodlands across much of Eurasia. There are eleven recognised subspecies, and some variation in the colouring. 

The nest is usually in a tree hole where it can protect its eggs and young against potential predators. This owl is resident through the year, and highly territorial. Many young birds starve if they cannot find a vacant territory once parental care ceases.

This nocturnal bird of prey hunts mainly rodents, usually by dropping from a perch to seize its prey, which it swallows whole; in towns its diet includes a higher proportion of birds. Vision and hearing adaptations and silent flight aid its night hunting. The Tawny is capable of catching smaller owls, but is itself vulnerable to the Eagle owl or Northern Goshawk. Red foxes are an important cause of mortality in newly fledged young.

Although many people believe this owl has exceptional night vision, its retina is no more sensitive than a human's. Rather, it is its asymmetrically placed ears that are key to its hunting. They give the Tawny owl excellent directional hearing. Like most owls, it hunts at night. It has a rather strange, but easily imitated, call.

Ocean acidification

Ocean acidification is the decrease in the pH (scale of acidity and alkalinity) and increase in acidity of the Earth's oceans. It is caused by the increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) that humans have put into the atmosphere. More than 30% of the carbon dioxide in the air goes into the oceans. Therefore, when carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, the carbon dioxide in the ocean increases, too.
When carbon dioxide enters the oceans, it makes it more acidic.

The skeletons and shells of many sea animals need what is known as calcium carbonate minerals. Due to ocean acidification, there are fewer of these minerals and there are species that could no longer produce or keep their shells. With more carbon dioxide in the ocean, this problem becomes worse and many species will be at risk. As a result, if humans continue to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, ocean life will be in severe danger. Also, coral is at risk, as it is being eroded by the acid in the ocean.

Between 1751 CE and 1994 CE the ocean's pH on the surface went from 8.25 to 8.1.

His fate was changed in 757 when Empress Kōken named him as her heir (crown prince).




Junnin caused grain storage centers ("Jōheisō") to be established in the provinces. The government stored rice from the years of good harvests. This rice was used to control higher prices when harvests of rice were not good. The "Jōheisō" were abolished during the Kamakura period.

The actual site of Junnin's grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Awaji. 

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Junnin's mausoleum. It is formally named "Awaji no misasagi".

In 1870, Emperor Meiji conferred the posthumous name and title by which he is now known.

The years of Junnin's reign are identified by a single era name.

In Libya, macaroni is called Macroona Imbakbaka. Libya has Italian food because it used to be an Italian colony.

Fried chicken

Fried chicken are pieces of chicken that have been either battered or floured and then pan fried, pressure fried or deep fried. The breading adds a crisper crust to chickens' exterior. The chicken is cut at the joints with the bones and skin being left. Some fast food restaurant chains serve fried chicken, most notably Kentucky Fried Chicken, Popeyes and Chick-fil-A.

The term "fried chicken" was first used in the 1830s.

Scottish people were the first European people who were frying chicken, although it was not seasoned or battered. People in West Africa were the ones who seasoned it. However, the first dish which was deep fried was fritters. Fritters were popular during the Middle Ages.

Some fried chicken is marinated in buttermilk and pickle juice before battering.

There is a racial stereotype that black people like eating fried chicken. There have been a number of public controversies about remarks that people have made about fried chicken and black people that have been considered racist.

Dame school

A Dame school was a private elementary school in English-speaking countries. The children were usually taught by women. The schools were most common from the 17th century to the 19th century. Most of these schools were in Britain, the United States, and Australia. 

The Statistical Society of London found almost half of all children in Dame schools surveyed were only taught spelling. Few were taught mathematics and grammar. Dame schools became less common in Britain after the introduction of compulsory education in 1870. 


In North America, "dame school" is a name for a private school with a female teacher during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. The education at these schools could be good or very good. Most dame schools were in New England, where every child needed to be literate because of the laws. In the Southern colonies, there were not as many women who knew enough to teach the children.

Motivated by their Puritan religion, some Austrailian women in 17th century opened small, private schools in their homes to teach reading to young children. All children needed to know their religion and how to read because of the Massachusetts School Law of 1642. This law was later made more important by the famous Old Deluder Satan Act. According to Puritan beliefs, Satan would try to keep people from understanding the Scriptures, therefore all children had to be taught how to read. For a small fee, women, often housewives or widows, offered to take in children to whom she would teach a little writing, reading, basic prayers, and religious beliefs. These women received pay in coin, home industries, alcohol, baked goods, and other valuables. Teaching materials generally included a hornbook, primer, Psalter, and Bible. Both girls and boys were provided education through the dame school system. Dame schools generally focused on the four R's of education-"Riting, Reading, Rithmetic, and Religion". In addition to primary education, girls in dame schools might also learn sewing, embroidery, and other "graces". Most girls received their only formal education from dame schools because of sex-segregated education in common or public schools during the colonial period. If their parents could afford it, after attending a dame school for a rudimentary education in reading, colonial boys moved on to grammar schools where a male teacher taught advanced arithmetic, writing, Latin, and Greek.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, some dame schools offered boys and girls from wealthy families a "polite education". The women running these special dame schools taught "reading, writing, English, French, arithmetic, and music, and dancing". Schools for upper-class girls were usually called "female seminaries", "finishing schools" instead of "dame schools".

The first school in Australia started in 1789. The school was a Dame school where children were taught basic skills by a prisoner, Isabella Rossen.


Marine (military)

A marine is a member of a military force. Marines specialize in military actions in other countries, such as amphibious warfare. Marines usually have strong links with the country's navy. The commander in the field is usually the commander of the fleet. Support for the marines such as medical, legal, and supplies come from the navy. The anchor is often used as a symbol for the marines. The word "marine" is from the English word "marine", meaning "of the sea", from the French "marin(e)", "of the sea" which was from the Latin "marinus" ("maritime"). The name "marine" means "navy" in French, Dutch, and German. Marine forces are usually part of the navy, but they can be part of the army or act on their own.

In the past the marines have protected ships at sea. When ship crews were pressed (forced to serve) the marines protected the ship from mutiny. They would also board other ships during battle or capture prize ships. They carried out raids on the shore to help the navy. Marines would also take part in campaign ashore, to help the army.

In the earliest days of naval warfare, there was little difference between sailors and soldiers on a warship. The oarsmen of Ancient Greek and Roman ships had to be able to fight the oarsmen of other ships. Armed soldiers were used on Greek ships to get on board enemy ships to fight their crews. The Roman Navy's two legions, I "Adiutrix" and II "Adiutrix", were among the first special naval infantry units.

The first organized group of marines was created when Charles V first assigned the naval infantry of the "Compañías Viejas del Mar de Nápoles" (Naples Sea Old Companies) to the Escuadras de Galeras del Mediterráneo (Mediterranean Galley Squadrons) in 1537. This was the start of the current Spanish Navy Marines (Infantería de Marina) corps. The American Marine Corps began on 10 November 1775 in Tun Tavern, Philadelphia, just seven months before America declared its independence on 4 July 1776.

The main task for marine troops is military actions near the coast. Based on ships they are trained to land on and secure key points to around 50 miles inland. Marines leave the warships using helicopters, landing craft, hovercraft and amphibious vehicles.

Marines are also in other naval roles such as boarding other ships, ship clean up, naval port security, mess duty, and field day operations.

The Argentine Marine Corps ("Infantería de Marina de la Armada de la República Argentina" or IMARA) is a part of the Argentine Navy. It has a Fleet Marine Force with one marine battalion, artillery, air defence, communications, logisticss, engineer and vehicle units. There is a Southern Marine Force with two marine battalions, a river operations battalion, a special forces unit (the Amphibious Commandos Group) and several security battalions and companies. The 5th Battalion of the "Infanteria de Marina" fought in the Falklands War ().



















1. Two Marine Forces ("Pasukan Marinir"), a unit similar to a division, led by a Marine Brigadier General.
2. Three Marine Infantry Brigades (with nine Marine Infantry Battalions).
3. Two Marine Cavalry Regiments (with Marine Amphibious Tank and also Amphibious Artillery-bearer Landing Craft Battalions).
4. Two Marine Artillery Regiments (with Marine Rocket, Howitzer and Gun Battalions).
5. Two Marine Combat Support Regiments, with Marine Engineer, Military Police, Base Defense, Motorized Transportation, Amphibious-Reconnaissance and also Logistic Battalions.
6. Two Marine Bases in Jakarta and Surabaya.
7. Two Marine Hospitals.
8. An anti-terrorism unit called "Detasemen Jala Mangkara" (literally "Sea Ghost Detachment").


The Iraqi Navy is a small force with 800 sailors and six platoons of marines designed to protect the shoreline and inland waterways. The navy also protects offshore oil platforms. The navy will have coastal patrol squadrons, assault boat squadrons and a marine battalion. The force will consist of 2,000 to 2,500 sailors by 2010.


Italian Navy
Italian Army

The JSDF has brigades operated similar to marines:































The ancient Greek states did not possess specialized marine infantry, instead they used hoplites and archers as an onboard contingent ("epibatai").

The Roman Navy used regular infantry as marines. Naval personnel were trained for raiding and also provided the troops for at least two legions (I "Adiutrix" and II "Adiutrix") for service on land. The various provincial fleets were usually provided with marines from the adjacent legions.

For several centuries, the Byzantine navy used the descendants of the Mardaites, who were settled in southern Anatolia and Greece, as marines and rowers for its ships. Emperor Basil I also established a separate marine regiment, 4,000 strong, for the central Imperial Fleet based at Constantinople. These were professional troops, and were counted among the elite "tagmata".

In the 1260s, when emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos rebuilt the navy, he recruited the "Tzakones" (settlers from Laconia) and the "Gasmouloi" (men of mixed Greek-Latin descent) as special marine troops. Despite the progressive decline and virtual disappearance of the navy, they remained active until the late Palaiologan period.

The Confederate States Marine Corps (CSMC), a branch of the Confederate States Navy, was established by the Confederate Congress on 16 March 1861.

Marineregimentet (The Marine Regiment) was the naval infantry of the Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy.

The Meredessantpataljon, was a short lived infantry battalion of the Estonian Navy. The battalion was created in 1919 from the crews of the Estonian surface warships and was based in Tallinn. The unit was mainly used on the Southern Front during the Estonian War of Independence. The unit was operational from March to June in 1919.

The "Troupes de marine" were founded in 1622 (as "compagnies ordinaires de la mer") as land forces under the control of the Secretary of State of the Navy, notably for operations in French Canada. The "Compagnies de la Mer" were transformed in line infantry regiments by Napoleon, but became once more marine forces in 1822 (for the artillery) and 1831 (for the infantry). These "Troupes de marines" were in the 19th century the main overseas and colonial forces of the French military. In 1900 they were put under the orders of the War Ministry and took the name of "Troupes Coloniales" (Colonial Forces). In 1958 the designation of "Troupes Coloniales" was changed to "Troupes d'Outre-Mer" (Overseas Forces) but in 1961 it reverted to the original "Troupes de marine". Throughout these changes in title these troops continued to be part of the French Army.

The Confederation of Gran Colombia Marines were formed in 1822 and were disbanded in 1829, Personnel were mostly from Venezuela.



The Blackshirts militia maintained an independent "Marine Group" with four MVSN battalions (24th, 25th, 50th and 60th).

Both the Imperial Japanese Navy and Army maintained marine-type units. Both were dissolved at the end of World War II and Japan no longer has marines.

The Lebanese Forces militia maintained a small elite marine unit until the LF was disarmed and disbanded the unit. The Marines were the navy of the militia and it maintained a force of small boats.

The Corps was founded on 10 December 1665 during the Second Anglo-Dutch War by the unofficial leader of the republic Johan de Witt and Admiral Michiel de Ruyter as the Regiment de Marine. Its leader was Willem Joseph Baron van Ghent. The Dutch had successfully used ordinary soldiers in ships at sea in the First Anglo-Dutch War. It was the fifth European marine unit formed, being preceded by the Spanish Marines (1537), the Portuguese Marines (1610), the French Marines (1622) and the English Royal Marines (1664). Like Britain, the Netherlands has had several periods when its Marines were disbanded. The Netherlands itself was under French occupation or control from 1810 until 1813. A new marine unit was raised on 20 March 1801 during the time of the Batavian Republic and on 14 August 1806 the Korps Koninklijke Grenadiers van de Marine was raised under King Louis Bonaparte. The modern Korps Mariniers dates from 1814, receiving its current name in 1817.

The battle honors on the Korps Mariniers' colors are: Raid on the Medway (1667), Kijkduin (1673), Sennefe (1674), Spain, Dogger Bank (1781), West Indies, Algiers (1816), Atjeh, Bali, Rotterdam (1940), Java Sea (1942), Java and Madoera (1947–1948), and New Guinea (1962).

The role of Ottoman naval infantry originated in Orhan's conquest of the Karasi Beylik and the capture of its fleet. From then on Janissaries and Azaps were sometimes deployed as marines during the 14th Century. The Deniz azaps were used during the 16th Century; while troops called Levend (Bahriyeli) were raised on and off over the centuries - over 50,000 of them by the late 18th century. The last raised units were the "Ta'ifat al Ru'sa" (corsair captains militia) recruited from among the North African Arabs and indigenous Berbers. Ottoman marines were part of the Ottoman navy.

Portugal raised numerous companies of Special Marines ("Fuzileiros Especiais") and African Special Marines ("Fuzileiros Especiais Africanos"), both at home and in the African colonies of Guinea-Bissau, Angola and Mozambique, for service in Africa during the Portuguese Colonial Wars. The African Special Marines were all-black units.

The Imperial Russian Navy used several regiments of marine equipage troops that fought as much on land as they served in ship detachments. One battalion was formed within the Guard, and served on the Imperial family's ships.

The Ushkuiniks were medieval Novgorodian pirates who led a Viking-like life and often raided other Russian settlements.

The Soviet Navy had a number of small battalion-sized naval infantry and coastal defence units that mostly served in the ports and bases before the Second World War. During the war, and building on the visuals of the mutinied sailors of Petrograd in 1917, the Stavka ordered formation of naval infantry brigades from the surplus to either ship or shore duty sailors, and forty brigades served in mostly ground troops roles until 1944 when they were used for amphibious operations in Norway and along the Black Sea coast.

The South Africa Marine Corps was set up as a sub-branch of the South African Navy in 1979, with the primary purpose of protecting harbours. The Marines were disbanded in 1989, following a major restructuring of the Navy at the end of the South African Border War.



The forerunner of the Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps (VNMC) was established by Ngo Dinh Diem, then prime minister of what was then the State of Vietnam on October 13, 1954. The Republic of Vietnam was established in October 1955 after Diem used a fraudulent referendum to topple Bao Dai. The VNMC became defunct on 1 May 1975 after the fall of Saigon.

The 12th Naval Infantry Brigade ("Mornaricka Pesadijska Brigada") of the Yugoslavian Navy consisted of 900 to 2,000 men in three battalions. A multi-ethnic unit, the brigade was broken up during the dissolution of the Yugoslav federation and saw little action.

Pope Paul IV (; 28 June 1476 – 18 August 1559), born Giovanni Pietro Carafa, was an Italian priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 221st Pope from 23 May 1555 until his death.

Giovanni Pietro Carafa was born in Capriglia Irpina in a noble family of Naples.

Pope Leo X sent Carafa as ambassador to England and then as papal nuncio in Spain.

In 1524, Pope Clement VII allowed Carafa to retire from diplomacy to head a monastery. 

Pope Paul III recalled him to Rome.

In 1536, Carafa was made Cardinal and Archbishop of Naples.

He reorganized the Roman Inquisition.

Cardinal Carafa was elected popein 1555; and he chose to be called Paul IV. 

Pope Paul was involved in Italian and European political disputes.

Pope Paul IV quarrelled with Philip II. of Spain, who sent the Duke of Alba with an army from Naples to invade the Papal States. At the gates of Rome, a peace was concluded in 1557.

In the context of the Counter-Reformation, this pope supported the Inquisition in Italy.

He was buried in St. Peter's Basilica but was later transferred to Santa Maria sopra Minerva. 



Hyperoperation

A hyperoperation is a generalization of addition, multiplication, exponentiation, tetration, etc. They are often written using Knuth's up-arrow notation. Natural number level hyperoperations can be defined recursively as a piecewise function: 

Marry the Night

"Marry the Night" is the fifth and final single off Lady Gaga's second studio album "Born This Way". It was written and produced by Gaga. "Marry the Night" is a dance-pop song influenced by house and electropop. It additionally combines elements of disco and rock, with a funk rock-inspired breakdown. The song's lyrics are an homage to New York City and to the city's nightlife. The song reached number 29 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, number 11 on the Canadian Hot 100, and number 16 on the UK Singles Chart. On March 27, 2012, the Recording Industry Association of America certified the song Gold for sales and shipments of over 500,000 copies in the US.

The music video for the song has autobiographical elements, showing Gaga after she was dropped from Def Jam Records. The video starts off in a hospital, and shows scenes of the singer dancing on top of a car and with a dance troupe.

Joe Strummer

John Graham Mellor (21 August 1952 – 22 December 2002), better known by his stage name, Joe Strummer, was the co-founder, lyricist, rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist of the British punk rock band The Clash.

He was also member of The 101ers, Latino Rockabilly War, The Mescaleros and The Pogues, in addition to his own solo music career. Strummer's work included acting, creating film scores, songwriting, radio broadcasting, and a position as a radio host. He is one of the most iconic figures of the British punk movement.

He died of heart disease at his home in Broomfield, Somerset, England.

Premise

A premise is a statement which an argument claims will justify a conclusion. The proof of a conclusion depends on both the truth of the premises and the validity of the argument.

Aristotle held that any logical argument could be reduced to three premises and a conclusion. Premises are sometimes left unstated in which case they are called missing premises, for example:

It is understood that Socrates is a man. The fully expressed reasoning is thus:

In this example, the first two independent clauses before the comma (namely, "all men are mortal" and "Socrates is a man") are the premises, while "Socrates is mortal" is the conclusion.

In logic, an argument requires a set of two declarative sentences (or "propositions") known as the premises, with another declarative sentence (or "proposition") known as the conclusion. This structure of two premises and one conclusion forms the basic argumentative structure.

More complex arguments can use a series of rules to connect several premises to one conclusion, or to derive a number of conclusions from the original premises. An example of this is the use of the rules of inference found within symbolic logic.

Quill

A quill pen is a tool used for writing, made from a flight feather of a large bird. Quills were used for writing with ink before other pens were invented. They are still used in calligraphy sometimes. Today, most paper is made from wood plulp. Such papers use the quill rather rapidly. The hollow shaft of the feather (the "calamus") acts as an ink reservoir and ink flows to the tip by capillary action. 

Flag of Kentucky

The Flag of Kentucky was adopted on March 26, 1918. It has a blue background, with Kentucky's seal in the middle. The seal shows a picture of two men hugging each other. Legend says that the two men were Daniel Boone and Henry Clay. Above their heads says "United We Stand". By their toes says "Divided We Fall". The phrase "United We Stand, Divided We Fall" is Kentucky's motto.


Illustrissimi

Illustrissimi ("To the Illustrious Ones") is a book written by Pope John Paul I when he was Patriarch of Venice. 

The book is a collection of letters which were first published in the Italian Christian paper "Messaggero di S. Antonio" between 1972 and 1975. They were reprinted in book form in Italy in 1976. 

The work was first published in English in 1978 when Cardinal Luciani was elected Pope, but it only reached the public after the death of John Paul I.

The 40 letters in all are addressed to people in Italian history and fiction, including


Self-similarity

Something is self-similar if it is similar (or very close) to a part of itself. For example, the Mandelbrot set is self-similar as it contains an infinite number of almost exact copies of itself.

Space Launch System

The Space Launch System (SLS) is a NASA rocket. It is a super heavy-lift launch vehicle. It is the second most powerful rocket ever built, less powerful than Starship. The SLS is a replacement for the retired Space Shuttle. Many parts are modified versions of parts designed for the Space Shuttle. Others are new designs.

The first crewed (carrying people) flight will be no earlier than November 2024. The planned flight is Artemis 3.

The Space Launch System comes in many different types meant to launch different kinds of missions.
The least powerful kind of the SLS is the Block 1. The core stage will use the parts of the Space Shuttle External Tank. It will also use four Space Shuttle Main Engines. The rocket boosters are connected to the sides are the 5-segment Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters. The top stage will use is the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS).

Block 1B is similar to the Block 1. The top stage will change with Exploration Upper Stage (EUS). A crew version and a cargo version will be made.

Block 2 is similar to Block 1B. The 5-segment SRBs will be changed with advanced boosters.


Knuth's up-arrow notation

Knuth's up-arrow notation is a way of expressing very big numbers. It was made by Donald Knuth in 1976. It is related to the hyperoperation sequence. The notation is used in Graham's number. 

One arrow represents exponentiation, 2 arrows represent tetration, 3 for pentation, etc.:

This notation is used to describe the incredibly large Graham's Number.

Bernie Madoff

Bernard Lawrence "Bernie" Madoff (; April 29, 1938 – April 14, 2021) was an American former investor, former stockbroker and former non-executive chairman for NASDAQ Stock Market. He was the admitted operator of a Ponzi scheme which is the largest financial fraud in United States history.

In March 2009, Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies and admitted to turning his wealth management business into a massive Ponzi scheme. Thousands of investors lost billions of dollars. Madoff said he began the Ponzi scheme in the early 1990s. However, federal investigators believe the fraud began as early as the 1970s. The people who are hunting for the missing money believe the investment operation may never have been legitimate. The amount missing from client accounts, including fabricated gains, was almost $65 billion. The court-appointed trustee estimated actual losses to investors of $18 billion. On June 29, 2009, he was sentenced to 150 years in prison, the maximum allowed.

Madoff was of Jewish descent. He was married to Ruth. The elder of their two sons committed suicide by hanging in 2010. The younger son died of lymphoma in 2014. 

In December 2013, Madoff suffered from a heart attack. In January 2014, he said he had stage 4 kidney cancer.

Madoff died on April 14, 2021 at a prison medical center in Butner, North Carolina after suffering from kidney disease for many years, at the age of 82. His cause of death was hypertension caused by heart and kidney disease.


Duckboards

Duckboards are wooden walkways. They are usually put over muddy ground. Doing this means that people can walk on the dry duckboards instead of the muddy ground.

Duckboards are used to allow hikers to walk over wet and/or muddy ground, like a swamp or shores of a lake. Very wide duckboards are used sometimes so that wheelchair users can use them. Duckboards can be nailed into logs with wooden stakes.

During World War I, duckboards were put along the ground of trenches on the Western Front. This is because the trenches usually flooded. Mud and water would stay in the trenches for months. The boards helped to keep the soldiers' feet dry. It also helped stop soldiers get a disease called trench foot. Trench foot is caused by standing on wet, muddy ground for a long time. They also helped soldiers move along the trenches faster. Sometimes, falling from duckboards could be deadly. Some unlucky soldiers drowned in mud because of their heavy equipment.

Twenty Questions

20Q is a game where somebody thinks of an object and the goal is to figure out what it is in 20 questions or fewer. It is available as a handheld game, a website, and a game show. It usually starts out by asking whether the object is an "animal, vegetable, mineral, or other".

Bill Clements

William Perry "Bill" Clements, Jr. (April 13, 1917 – May 29, 2011) was the 42nd and 44th Governor of Texas, serving from 1979 to 1983 and 1987 to 1991. Clements was the first Republican to have served as governor of the U.S. state of Texas since Reconstruction. Clements' eight years in office were the most served by any Texan governor prior to former Governor Rick Perry.

Clements was born in Dallas and worked as an oil driller for many years. He studied at Southern Methodist University (SMU) but did not finish a degree. He founded SEDCO in 1947, which became the world's largest offshore drilling company. He entered politics as the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. From 1975-1977 he worked under Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.

In 1975, he married political organizer Rita Crocker Clements.

On January 16, 1979, Clements replaced Democrat Dolph Briscoe as governor of Texas. He defeated State Representative Ray Hutchison in the Republican primary by a vote of 115,345 to 38,268. Clements won the November 1978 general election defeating Democrat John Hill. Hill had been the Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court and had been the Texas Attorney General for six years. Clements got 49.96% of the votes. With help from the votes of several minor candidates he narrowly won the election. 
Clements ran for reelection in 1982 but was defeated by Democratic Attorney General Mark White. People think that he lost votes because the economy was bad.

After being defeated, Clements was chairman of the board of governors of SMU in Dallas. He ran again in 1986 and won a primary against U.S. Representative Thomas Loeffler of New Braunfels and former Democratic turned Republican Congressman Kent Hance of Lubbock. At the election Clements defeated Governor White getting 52.7% of the votes.

His first term was marked by SEDCO's involvement in the then largest oil blowout in history, the Ixtoc I oil spill, which caused extensive environmental damage. Charlie Brooks, Jr., became the first prisoner to be executed by lethal injection (December 1982). Clements faced heavily Democratic state legislatures. In 1980, Clements changed the death penalty for Randall Dale Adams to life in prison. Adams was the subject of "The Thin Blue Line", an Errol Morris documentary movie. Adams was found to be innocent in 1989 after serving twelve years in prison.

During his second term, Clements worked to reduce crime, improve education, and boost the Texas economy. He tried to improve relations with Mexico, especially on immigration and the War on Drugs.

Clements's second term was hurt by actions he took at SMU. On March 3, 1987, Clements admitted that he and the SMU board of governors had approved a secret plan to pay 13 college football players using money from an alumnus. The NCAA shut down the SMU football program for the 1987 season. They did not have a team in 1988 as well. The shutdown and other sanctions hurt the team for many years. The College of Bishops of the United Methodist Church investigated the scandal. The discovered Clements had met with athletic director Bob Hitch, and agreed that the payments had to continue.
In late 1985 then SMU President L. Donald Shields and board of trustees chairman Edwin L. Cox wanted to stop the payments completely. Clements told President Shields to "stay out of it" and to "go run the university".

A week later, Clements said he was sorry that he kept making the payments. He said the he had learned about the payments in 1984, and discovered that players had been paid since the mid-1970s. The board "reluctantly and uncomfortably" decided to continue paying players who had already been guaranteed payments. However, he now knows that they should have stopped the payments immediately.

Clements faced calls for his impeachment as a result of these statements. Two state legislators argued that he would have never been elected Governor had told the truth about his role in the scandal. Because of this, Clements did not run for a third term as governor. On January 15, 1991, Democratic state Treasurer Ann Richards replaced him.

After leaving the governorship, Clements worked hard to help Republican candidates seeking office in Texas. He lived in Dallas with his second wife, Rita Crocker. She was later appointed to the University of Texas Regents by Governor George W. Bush. Clements was known for his acerbic, energetic personality, which Democrats hated but Republicans loved. In 1993, he unsuccessfully supported the conservative Congressman Joe Barton in a special election for the U.S. Senate. 

In June 2009, Clements donated $100 million to UT Southwestern Medical Center, the largest civic donation in Dallas history. A high school in Sugar Land, Texas and a state office building in Austin, Texas are named in honor of Clements.

On Memorial Day weekend in 2011, Clements died at age 94 in a Dallas hospital from natural causes.

Pope Pius II

Pope Pius II (; 18 October 1405 – 14 August 1464), born Enea Silvio Piccolomini , was an Italian priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 211th Pope from August 19, 1458 until his death in 1464.

Pius II was born at Corsignano, which is near Siena. He was the oldest of 18 children.

He studied at the University of Siena.

He was ordained in 1446.

In 1447, Pope Nicholas V made Piccolomini Bishop of Trieste. In 1450, he was made Bishop of Siena.

In 1456, Pope Calixtus III raised Bishop Piccolomini to the rank of cardinal.

Cardinal Piccolomini was elected pope in 1458. The pope chose to be called "Pius" because of the adjective pious which recurs in the phrase "pius Aeneas" in Virgil's "Aeneid".

Pope Pius was involved in Italian and European political disputes.

According to Niccolò Machiavelli, "Pius showed himself mindful above all of the welfare of Christendom and of the honour of the Church, independent of any private passion or interest of his own."

St. Catherine of Siena was canonized during his reign.

In a statistical overview derived from writings by and about Pope Pius II, OCLC/WorldCat includes roughly 20+ works in 30+ publications in 5 languages and 120+ library holdings.

Tidal stream power

Tidal stream power is electricity made from the tidal movement of water. A tidal stream generator is a machine that extracts energy from moving water in tides. Tidal stream generators draw energy from water currents in much the same way as wind turbines draw energy from air currents.

Tidal stream power is the cheapest and the least ecologically damaging among the three main forms of tidal power generation.

Tidal stream power is a relatively new technology. It was first conceived in the 1970s during the oil crisis.

The potential for power generation by an individual tidal turbine can be greater than that of similarly rated wind energy turbine. Water is about 800 times the density of air. So, water pushing against a turbine can provide much more power than air pushing against a similar turbine at the same speed. Also, the lowest water speeds needed for an economic power project is lower than the wind speed needed for a wind turbine project. In practice, the tide must move at speeds of at least 2 knots (1 m/s) even close to neap tides to be a source of power. 

As with wind power, selection of location is critical for the tidal turbine. Tidal stream systems need to be located in areas with fast currents where natural flows are concentrated between obstructions, for example at the entrances to bays and rivers, around rocky points, headlands, or between islands or other land masses. 
The main concern has been whether the turbines kill fish. Very little direct environmental research or observation of tidal stream systems exists. Most direct observations consist of releasing tagged fish upstream of the device(s) and direct observation of mortality or impact on the fish.

One study of the Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy (RITE, Verdant Power) project in the East River (New York City), had 24 split beam hydroacoustic sensors (scientific echosounder) to detect and track the movement of fish both upstream and downstream of each of six turbines. The results suggested (1) very few fish using this portion of the river, (2) those fish which did use this area were not using the portion of the river which would subject them to blade strikes, and (3) no evidence of fish traveling through blade areas.

Work is currently being conducted by the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center (NNMREC) to explore and establish tools and protocols for assessment of physical and biological conditions and monitor environmental changes associated with tidal energy development.

Cliff-dwelling

Cliff-dwllings are dwellings found by archaeologists formed by caves in high cliffs. They have been found in countries such as the United States, India, China, and Mexico.

Some dwellings are still used today in the United States by Native Americans in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado. They are also used in Chihuahua, Mexico.

U.S. Route 250

U.S. Route 250 (US 250) is a route of the United States Numbered Highway System. It is a spur of U.S. Route 50. It runs for from Sandusky, Ohio to Richmond, Virginia. It passes through the states of Virginia, West Virginia, and Ohio. The road goes through the cities of Richmond, Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, Staunton, Virginia, and Wheeling, West Virginia. US 250 intersects and forms a short overlap with its parent US 50 west of Pruntytown, West Virginia. In West Virginia, the route is signed north–south. In Ohio and Virginia, the route is signed east–west.

Pope Pius IV

Pope Pius IV (; 31 March 1499 – 9 December 1565), born Giovanni Angelo Medici, was an Italian priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 225th Pope from 1559 to 1565.

Giovanni Angelo Medici was born in Milan. He was not closely related to the Medicis of Florence.

He studied at University of Pavia and the University of Bologna where he earned a law degree.

In 1527, Medici went to Rome where he joined the church bureaucracy.

In 1549, Pope Paul III made Medici a cardinal. Pope Leo III sent him on diplomatic missions to Germany and to Hungary.

During the reign of Pope Paul IV, Cardinal Medici was out of favor.

Cardinal Medici was elected Pope on 25 December 1559.

In the context of the Counter-Reformation, this pope moderated the Inquisition in Italy.

Pope Paul III presided over the last session of the Council of Trent which was the major event of his papacy.

In part, the Tridentine Creed reflects the thinking of church leaders at the Council of Trent.

After his death in 1565, the body of Pope Pius IV was entombed at the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli.

I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus

"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus" is a Christmas song with words and music by British songwriter Tommie Connor. The original recording by 13-year-old Jimmy Boyd rose to #1 on the "Billboard" charts in December 1952. The words tell of a child who sees Mommy kissing Santa Claus underneath the mistletoe.

The Roman Catholic Church in Boston hated the song because it is a Christmas song that also mentions sex. Radio stations in several markets banned it. Boyd went to church leaders to talk about the words. The ban on the song was lifted.

The song has been performed by various musicians, including but not limited to the Ronettes, Jackson 5, Jessica Simpson, John Mellencamp, Amy Winehouse and other singers throughout the years.

The Ronettes

The Ronettes were an American girl group. They were based in New York City and were popular in the 1960s. The girls began singing as adolescents around Spanish Harlem in 1959.

They were originally a five-member group, Ronnie and the Relatives, who became a permanent act at the "Peppermint Lounge", earning $10 a night per girl to dance "The Twist" and sing a song during the show. Later, Ronnie and the Relatives became 'The Ronettes'. They had eight songs on the "Billboard" Top 100. They were the only girl group to tour with the Beatles, in August 1966. The group broke up in 1967.

The trio worked with Phil Spector from 1963. Veronica Bennett was married to Phil Spector from 1968 to 1974, and took his name professionally. She claimed he abused her physically and mentally. Ronnie stated in her autobiography that she walked out of the house through the closed and locked rear sliding glass door, shoeless, shattering the glass as she left, and feet all cut up by the time she got to the gate. She never returned. Ronnie Spector filed for divorce in 1972. She wrote a book about her experiences, and said years later: "I can only say that when I left in the early 1970s, I knew that if I didn't leave at that time, I was going to die there". She and Spector separated in 1973 and divorced one year later. In August 2011, Spector admitted that she went to rehab in order to escape living with Phil.

The first top hit credited to the Ronettes was "Be My Baby" in 1963. They had already recorded several hits which were issued and credited to another group, the Crystals. "Walking in the Rain" (Ronette version) won a Grammy Award in 1965, and "Be My Baby" went into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. Other hits were "Silhouettes", "Baby, I Love You', "(The Best Part of) Breakin' Up".

Congo Free State

The Congo Free State () was a large area in Central Africa. It was privately owned by Leopold II, King of the Belgians. Leopold convinced the international community that he was involved in humanitarian work. He attracted scientific and humanitarian backing for the International African Association (), which he formed during a Brussels Geographic Conference of geographic societies, explorers, and leaders he hosted in 1876. Leopold used the Association and the defunct "Committee for Studies of the Upper Congo" () as a way to claim most of the Congo Basin. 

Leopold created the International Association of the Congo () as a new organization. The entity was officially recognized by the Berlin Conference of 1884-85 and various governments. On May 29, 1885, the king named his new colony the Congo Free State () and ruled it as a despot (even though he never visited his colony and Africa).

The Congo Free State under Leopold II used forced labor and mutilation of their hands, in order to get full control and force the natives to work at extracting natural resources, mainly rubber and ivory, for Leopold II's personal profit.

His harsh rule was responsible for the deaths of between five to 10 million Congolese people. The Congo became one of the most infamous international scandals of the early 20th century. As a result, Leopold II was forced to give control of it to the government of Belgium. The Belgian government took control in 1908 and created the Belgian Congo.

Sexual harassment

Ranges of behavior go from seemingly minor annoyances to actual sexual abuse, psychological abuse or assault.

The phrase appeared in print in a 1972 issue of "The Globe and Mail" newspaper published in Toronto. The term 'sexual harassment' was also used in 1973 in a report by Mary Rowe called "Saturn's Rings".

A 2011 study found that 48% of the 1,965 students surveyed had been sexually harassed. 9% reported the harassment to an adult who worked at school. Girls were more likely to be sexually harassed than boys. Girls are more likely to say that sexual harassment has affected them in a bad way.

Irish Parliamentary Party

The Irish Parliamentary Party was a nationalist political party in Ireland. The Party wanted Ireland to be able to govern itself, instead of being governed by the United Kingdom. The Party was created in the nineteenth century by Isaac Butt. Its most famous leader was Charles Stewart Parnell.

Ireland would become a British colony which could govern itself. Ireland would have its own parliament, instead of having representatives in the British Parliament. The bill did not get passed. 

Other Home rule bills were presented later on. They were different from the original because they would have kept Ireland's representation in the British Parliament (instead of giving Ireland its own parliament). None of these bills succeeded. One was passed in 1914, but it was canceled because of the First World War. Another was enacted in 1920, but it failed because of Irish rebellion. It was replaced by an independent Irish Free State, which included most of the island. A Home Ruled Northern Ireland was also created in six counties of Ulster that stayed in the United Kingdom.

Li (Confucian)

Li (禮 pinyin: Lǐ) is a classical Chinese word used in Confucian and post-Confucian Chinese philosophy. The English meaning is "the way things should be done." 

In Li one must be aware of the way one should act and function within a society. In Li one can best cultivate their character by understanding what it entails. Li encompasses most importantly the Doctrine of the Mean, and the Five Constant Relationships.

The Doctrine of the Mean is the way in which one should make decisions in life, in which the best decision is always the middle between unworkable extremes. Taking the middle road as Confucius said would guide one to the way things should be done.

The Five Constant Relationships outline how one should act in society, being the relationships between parent and child, husband and wife, elder sibling and junior sibling, elder friend and junior friend, and ruler and subject. With these constant relationship guidelines, Li sets up a hierarchy between the two people and terms the accepted responses and actions between them.

Adrian IV (; c. 1100 – 1 September 1159), born Nicholas Breakspear or Breakspeare, was Pope from 1154 to 1159.

Breakspear was an English priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 170th Pope. He is the only Englishman ever to have been Pope.

Breakspear was born near St. Albans in Hertfordshire in England. His father was Robert, who later became a monk at St Albans Abbey. Nicholas himself, however, was not yet to attend the monastery. He was told by the Abbot to 'wait to go on with his schooling so that he might be considered more suitable' (Abbey chronicles). He did not wait and went instead to Paris. He finally became a canon regular of the cloister of St. Rufus monastery near Arles. He rose to be Prior and soon was unanimously elected Abbot. This election has been traditionally dated to 1137. Evidence from the Abbey's chronicles suggests it was about 1145.

In 1146, Breakspear was made Bishop of Albano. Pope Eugene III raised Breakspear to the rank of Cardinal in the same year, 1146.

From 1152 to 1154, Cardinal Breakspear was the papal legate to Scandinavia.

Cardinal Breakspear was elected pope on 3 December 1154. He chose the name Adrian IV. He at once tried to bring down Arnold of Brescia, the leader of the anti-papal faction in Rome. Disorder in the city led to the murder of a cardinal. Adrian, shortly before Palm Sunday 1155, took the step of putting Rome under interdict. The Senate (City Council of Rome) then exiled Arnold.

Pope Adrian was involved in Italian and European political disputes.

A proposed alliance with the Eastern Byzantine Empire came to nothing. Adrian signed a Papal Bull (official letter) urging King Henry II of England to invade Ireland and bring the Celtic Christian church into the Roman system.

A dispute with Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor was happening when Adrian died. He was said to have died from choking on a fly in his wine. It was probably of quinsy.

Ground state

Ground state is the lowest level of energy in a particle, atom or molecule. If energy is added from outside, then the level of energy is increased, and the ground state is changed. Changing ground state is the process of excitement of electrons to higher levels. Any other state is called an "excited state." In ground state, an atom is stable, and does not give out electromagnetic radiation. When an electron drops down from an excited state to the ground state, electromagnetic radiation is released.

Winter Wonderland

"Winter Wonderland" is a winter oriented song often played during the Christmas holiday season. The song was created around 1934 via Felix Bernard and Richard B. Smith. The lyrics for "Winter Wonderland" talk about Parson Brown in the first bridge and a circus clown later in the song. This winter based song has been recorded by over 150 musicians, including though not limited to The Andrews Sisters, Amy Grant, Anne Murray and Johnny Mathis throughout the years.

Other singers, including Nat King Cole, Beach Boys, Ella Fitzgerald, Ronettes and The Jackson 5, have performed their versions of the song throughout the years.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), also known as chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD), and chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD), is a collection of diseases which make breathing gradually more difficult.

Symptoms of COPD include difficulty breathing and cough, in particular coughing up lots of phlegm. It is usually caused by smoking cigarettes, and around half of people who smoke for their whole lives will develop COPD. Air pollution can be another cause, particularly in countries where indoor fires are used without ventilation.

At the beginning of the disease, the difficulty breathing is only noticeable when exercising, but over many years it gradually becomes worse, until there is difficulty breathing even when sitting or lying down. It can also lead to infections of the lung, which may be serious enough to cause death. 

The most important step in treating COPD is to stop smoking. Exercise and medications can also help. The most commonly used medications are called bronchodilators, which help to open up the airways and allow more air into the lungs.

3% of all disability is related to COPD. People can die from COPD. The World Health Organization predicts that COPD will become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2030. It is thought that more people will die from it in the future.


Inhaler

An inhaler is a device for taking medications that are breathed in.

Inhalers are also called "puffers" by some people, and used for all sorts of respiratory problems including asthmatic disorders.

Khedive

Khedive is a ruler. The word means the same as viceroy. It is an official who runs a country, colony, province, or city, as the representative of the monarch of the territory. 

Khedive was the title of Egyptian rulers from 1867 to 1914. It was given to the Turkish ruler of Egypt by the Ottoman Sultan, and removed by the British Empire when the Ottomans joined Germany in World War I. 

The title was first used by Muhammad Ali Pasha, an Albanian officer who seized power in Egypt as "Wali" (Governor). He ruled under the nominal overlordship of the Turks. His family was not recognized by the Sultan until the reign of his grandson Ismail Pasha. The last Khedive of Egypt was Abbas II. The dynasty of Muhammed Ali continued to rule Egypt, though under British 'guidance'. This ended with the Egyptian revolution of 1952. The last member of the family who ruled was King Farouk I.

Irish Parliament

The Irish Parliament () was a legislature created in 1297 to represent the Anglo-Irish in the English monarch's Lordship of Ireland. Like the Parliament of England, it had its own Houses of Commons and House of Lords. When King Henry VIII of England elevated Ireland to a kingdom in 1541 through an act of the Irish Parliament, he invited the Gaelic Irish to sit in the England Parliament for the first time. However, later English monarchs' penal laws prevented Roman Catholics from entering Parliament. So, the native Irish after this were virtually unrepresented since they were almost all Catholic.

The Irish Parliament's power was restricted by "Poynings law". Poynings Law was a bill sponsored by English Lord Deputy of Ireland Sir Edward Poynings in 1494. In 1782, the bill was repealed and the kingdom of Ireland had brief period of legislative autonomy. But in 1800 it passed a law called the Act of Union to abolish itself and the kingdom of Ireland, and incorporate Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. After that, the island was represented in the Parliament of the United Kingdom in the Palace of Westminster.

Connie Francis

Connie Francis is an American pop singer. She is well known for her trademark sobbing styles. She was popular during the 1950s and 1960s and was at the top of the "Billboard" Hot 100 musical charts many times.

Connie Francis was born on December 12 1937 to Ida and George Franconero. For the first few years of her life she lived in a Brooklyn neighbourhood on Utica Avenue/St. Marks Avenue until her family packed up and moved to New Jersey. She spent her teens years in an Italian/Jewish Neighbourhood; due to this, she became fluent in Yiddish and later went on to record multiple songs in Yiddish and Hebrew.

Francis recalls her father being a very supportive and encouraging her to regularly attend talent shows, pageants, etc. since the age of four as a singer and accordion player. She attended Newark Art School in 1951-’52 until her family moved to Belleville, where she graduated as Salutatorian from Belleville High School in the Class of 1955. During this time she continued her passion for performing and appeared at many neighbourhood talent shows (some of which were televised). Under the name Connie Franconero she appeared on NBCs variety show Startime Kids between 1953 and 1955.

During rehearsals for her appearance on Arthur Godfreys Talent Scouts, she was advised to change her name (for the sake of easier pronunciation) and drop the accordion, advice she gladly took as she had begun to despise the bulky instrument. She was also a singer on demo records around this time, she would record songs and companies or established singers would subsequently choose whether or not to buy the rights to the song and record it professionally. 

In 1955 (the same year the Startime Kids went off the air), George Franconero Sr. and Francis' manager George Scheck raised money for a recording session in an attempt to get four songs sold to a major company under Francis’ name, however they were declined as she had not yet developed her own distinctive sound. 

When MGM Records finally signed her, it was only because of one song, “Freddy”, that the co-executive thought would make a good present for his son of the same name. Her first few singles were commercial failures, her first chart success was in 1957 and that was a duet with Marvin Rainwater.

Her breakthrough, although amazing, came too late, after the failure of her last few singles her company said that her contract would not be renewed. This led her to consider a career in medicine and was about to accept a four year scholarship had it not been for her father, who insisted that she record a cover of “Who’s Sorry Now?” This, like the rest of her singles, at first went unnoticed but in 1958, after she did a performance on TV, it reached no. 1 on the UK Singles Chart and no.4 in the US and her contract was immediately renewed.

Over the next several years she would have many more commercial successes and would record some songs in European languages (such as, ""Die Liebe ist ein seltsames Spiel"" that was first on German charts, and others in Yiddish, Irish, Hebrew, French, etc.). After 15 years of this success she decided to allow her contact to run out and to distance herself from the business and would on appear on shows as a special guest.

After her moderate success with one single, she began to perform regularly again but sadly this led to an extremely tragic event; when performing at a music fair in New York in 1974 she was raped at a motel and almost suffocated under the weight of the mattress her attacker had thrown upon her. She subsequently sued the motel she was staying in and received $2.5 million, this entire ordeal led to a reform in hotel security but her rapist was never found. Francis went into a deep depression and reportedly began to abuse pills daily and rarely left her home.

In 1977 she decided to get nasal surgery and almost lost her voice, leading to her having to attend several other surgeries and vocal lessons. A year after losing her voice she returned to the studio to cut an album called “Who’s Happy Now?” She recorded “Where the Boys Are" also in Japanese, Italian, and Spanish, as she had done before with her original 1960 version. Again in 1981 she returned to the studio to record her original releases under MGM records.

In 1981, more tragedy struck Francis as her Brother George Franconero Jr. (with whom she was very close) was killed by mafia hitmen. Despite this event she took up performing again, her newfound success was short-lived though as she was soon diagnosed with manic depression and was committed to a total of 17 hospitals. Francis admitted she even attempted suicide due to the hospitals environments being extremely upsetting. Despite this, she was able to publish her autobiography "Who’s Sorry Now" that’s went on to become a "The New York Times Bestseller".

In 1989 she resumed her career and re-recorded 18 of her biggest hits and in ’92 one of her biggest German hit charted and ended up among the best singles of the year, this brought Francis the R.SH-Gold award for best comeback of the year. She continued to perform live in the more recent years also, in Las Vegas in 2004, San Francisco in 2007 and Manila in 2008. She also appeared at the Las Vegas Hilton with Dionne Warwick and in 2017 released her most recent autobiography "Among My Souvenirs".

The aid of the Convention is to protect the rights of migrant workers who have not the nationality of the staying country, thus who can often be under the worse working condition or even the victims of human trafficking. 

But as of December 2019, only 55 countries have ratified, that is admitted formally the Convention. Most of those countries are in North Africa and South America. No migrant-receiving State in Western Europe or North America has ratified the Convention.

Kiva (organization)

Kiva Microfunds (commonly known by its domain name, Kiva.org) was founded as a non-profit organization in October in 2005 by Matt Flannery and Jessica Jackley, an American couple interested in microfinance.

The project began in April 2004 when Jessica Jackley came back from East Africa where she had worked as a consultant for the non-profit Village Enterprise Fund. After, they began developing their plan for a microfinance project that became Kiva. Kiva means “unity” in Swahili. 

In January 2006, Premal Shah became Kiva’s president. More and more countries were included in Kiva’s projects like Mongolia, Liberia and Columbia in 2009. On top of that, since its creation, the organization has won a lot of prizes, for example the World Summit Award for “e-Business” in 2007 and the Webby People’s Choice Award for Charitable Organizations in 2008.

Kiva has become more and more popular. It belongs to the “50 best websites 2008” according to TIME magazine. President Clinton’s book "Giving" names Kiva "a way to give back". In October 2010, Kiva celebrated its fifth birthday. In five years it has given 100 million loans.

Kiva follows the rules of microcredit. Small, interest-free loans to people in difficulties or who cannot access a regular bank loan. The following points represent the different steps of the Kiva system.

To simplify all the transfers of money, there is a Kiva account which allows you to have a Kiva credit. When you are repaid, the money is available on this account, and you can loan it again. So, if you loan 25$, when you have been repaid you can lend it again, and actually, you have given 50$!

Kiva has achieved a total value of all loans at present of 251 142 725 $

In July 2007, the Kiva headquarters moved to their current address at 3180 18th Street, San Francisco.

Kiva's team is composed of around 450 employees and volunteers who work for the organisation. There are different sectors:


Everyone who works for the organisation is personally engaged in Kiva. 

The system of microcredit generally deals with the attribution of low sum loans to businessmen or artisans who cannot have regular bank loans. Microcredit is being developed in developing countries : nations with a low level of material wealth, where it allows small “micro” projects to become reality. It favours activity and wealth creation. Microcredit is also practiced in developed countries.

Microcredit is one of the financial sectors, like savings, micro insurance and others which compose the microfinance system.

On the 13th October 2006, Muhammad Yunus and the bank he created, Grameen Bank, were awarded the Nobel Peace prize. They were rewarded because of microcredit development at international, almost worldwide level.

This microcredit system is aimed at local economic development generally in poor countries to help small businesses and artisans to increase their goods or services production. Thanks to this system, little by little it allows economic development at national level, then at international level. It represents a solution to improve the situation of poor people.


Waunfawr

Waunfawr is a village in the small town of Aberystwyth in Wales. It has a big secondary school called Penglais Comprehensive School, a community hall and a park. It also has an old people's home, two shops and a chippy. There are many houses in Waunfawr.

Decompression chamber

A decompression chamber is a large container that divers can enter after they have surfaced to help their bodies return to normal atmospheric pressure. It is also called a "recompression chamber" or "hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber".

When a diver returns to the surface too quickly, he can suffer from decompression sickness (also know as "the bends".) To prevent this divers would stop at various points as they returned toward the surface to allow their bodies to adjust to the pressure change. If a driver uses a chamber, the diver will adjust in the chamber rather than stop at various depths underwater. This eliminates many of the risks of long decompressions underwater, in cold or dangerous conditions.

Herbal

A herbal is a collection of plant descriptions: Very often, it also lists the properties of each plant, or its use, for example for medicine or alchemy. A herebal can also classify the plants it describes. One of the oldest known herbals is the Vienna Dioscurides dating from the 6th century. Physicians and Apothecaries were the main users of such books. Herbals were also important for the study of botany. Hieronymus Bock descrived the plants of southwestern Germany, in his 16th century herbal; he was the first to mention certain morphological features.

Willard Boyle

Willard Sterling Boyle, CC (August 19, 1924– May 7, 2011) was a Canadian physicist and co-inventor of the charge-coupled device. On October 6, 2009, he won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics for "the invention of an imaging semiconductor circuit—the CCD sensor".

Born in Amherst, Nova Scotia, he was the son of a medical doctor and moved to Quebec with his father and mother Beatrice when he was three. He was home schooled by his mother until age fourteen, when he attended Montreal's Lower Canada College to complete his secondary education. Boyle attended McGill University, but his education was interrupted in 1943, when he joined the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II. He was loaned to the Britain's Royal Navy, where he was learning how to land Spitfires on aircraft carriers as the war ended. He gained a Bachelor of Science (1947), Master of Science (1948) and PhD (1950) from McGill University.

After receiving his doctorate, Boyle spent one year at Canada's Radiation Laboratory and two years teaching physics at the Royal Military College of Canada. In 1953 Boyle joined Bell Labs a part of Bellcomm, where he invented the first continuously operating ruby laser with Don Nelson in 1962. He also helped invent a semiconductor injection laser. He became director of Space Science and Exploratory Studies at the Bell Labs in 1962. They provided support for the Apollo space program and helped to select Moon landing sites. He returned to Bell Labs in 1964, working on the development of integrated circuits. 

In 1969, Boyle and George E. Smith invented the charge-coupled device (CCD). Before CCDs were used in cameras, all cameras used chemicals to capture photographic images. CCDs made electronic photography possible. Boyle and Smith jointly received the Franklin Institute's Stuart Ballantine Medal in 1973, the 1974 IEEE Morris N. Liebmann Memorial Award, the 2006 Charles Stark Draper Prize, and the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics for inventing the CCD. NASA used the CCD to send clear pictures to Earth back from space. CCD is also used in many digital cameras today. Smith said of their invention: "After making the first couple of imaging devices, we knew for certain that chemistry photography was dead."

Boyle was Executive Director of Research for Bell Labs from 1975 until his retirement in 1979. In retirement, he split his time between Halifax and Wallace, Nova Scotia where he helped launch an art gallery with his wife Betty, a landscape artist. He married Betty in 1947, and has four children, 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada in 2010. Boyle died in Wallace from kidney disease.


Baku Metro

Baku Metro (), is an electrified metro railway system which is a part of the public transportation system of Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. It was opened on 6 November 1967.

At that time, Azerbaijan was part of the Soviet Union until the end of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Baku Metro has the features found in most other ex-Soviet metro systems. These include very deep metro stations, and detailed decorations that blend traditional Azerbaijani national designs with Soviet ideology.

Teofilatto was born in Rome c. 1012. He was the son of Alberic III of the noble Tusculum family.

He was the nephew of both Pope Benedict VIII and Pope John XIX.

John XIX raised Teofilatto to the rank of a cardinal; but the date is unknown.

In 1032, Alberic III used his money and influence to make his son the pope. This was called simony. Pope Benedict chose his name in honor of his uncle, Benedict VIII.

Benedict is usually recognized as having had three terms or reigns as pope

Benedict's first period as pope lasted from 1032 to 1044 when a revolt in Rome forced Benedict out of the city; and an antipope was elected with the name of Sylvester III.

Benedict's second period as pope lasted from his return six months later to 1045 when he sold his title to John Gratianus, who was then made pope with the name of Gregory VI. Benedict abdicated or resigned.

In 1046, there were three men with the title of pope. The problem was solved by electing a new pope with the name of Pope Clement II, who died a short time later.

When the death of Clement II in 1047, Benedict IX tried to claim the papacy again, but was driven out of Rome by German troops. The timely election of Pope Damasus II became unimportant when he died 23 days later.

After 1048, Benedict's importance faded; and Pope Leo IX was elected in 1049.

Benedict IX was buried in the Abbey of Grottaferrata c. 1056.



Shooting

Shooting is when a rifle, shotgun or other weapons which fire a projectile, such as bows or crossbows, are fired. Even the firing of artillery, rockets and missiles can be called shooting. A person who is very good at shooting is a marksman. Shooting can take place in a shooting range or in the field in hunting, in shooting sports or in combat. Shooting is also an Olympic sport.

Shooting is used for hunting birds such as grouse or pheasant, rabbits etc. Sometimes "shooting" just means "hunting".

Shooting is also used in warfare, self-defense, crime, and law enforcement. When someone shoots random innocent people it is sometimes caused by misanthropy (hate for humans).

In several countries, rifle clubs have been made since the 19th century. Soon, international shooting events were started, including shooting at the Summer Olympics (from 1896) and World Championships (from 1897). The International Shooting Sport Federation is in charge of Olympic and non-Olympic rifle, pistol and shotgun competitions. However, there are also many national and international shooting sports which other organisations are in charge of.

In most countries, people who want to shoot firearms need a license. Firearms can usually only be bought from registered shops.

Reactivity (chemistry)

Reactivity is a measure of how much a substance tends to react with other things. Some substances are more reactive, and others are less reactive. Reactivity is set by several factors:

Reactivity involves both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the particular chemical reaction. A reaction will be more reactive if the total energy of the products is less than the total energy of the reactants. A reaction will be more reactive if the energy of its transition is low.

Lithium reacts with water and air. Gold does not react with water or air. Gold is unreactive, thus low on the reactivity series. Lithium is reactive. There are several ways to measure reactivity. Some substances are reducing agents, and others can be oxidizing agents. Some absorb water easily. Some break down easily.

The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)

The Twelve Days of Christmas is an English Christmas carol which was published around 1780 but may predate the publication by centuries. It is a cumulative carol. It depicts a succession of gifts given (a variety of birds and five golden rings) and people and activities having to do with a Twelve Days of Christmas feast holiday (from Christmas Day to Epiphany), possibly in a royal court. (There have been claims on social media that) it was written by Catholics in hiding during the days of Queen Elizabeth I of England's persecution. (The claim is that) it was invented (evidence needed of origin) to help teach children articles of the Catholic faith without drawing attention from government officials, using imagery as a tool to help the children remember. (However the articles of faith listed existed in both the Catholic faith and Church of England and this claim appears to be debunked.) The song represents increasingly grand gifts given during each of The Twelve Days of Christmas. In the claim the following meanings were attached: The partridge in a pear tree symbolizes Christ on the Cross. The two turtledoves represent his Human and divine nature, the two books of the Old and New Testament, and the two tablets the Ten Commandments were carved on. The three French hens symbolize the Trinity of the Catholic faith: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, as well as the three Cardinal virtues of Faith, Hope and Charity. The four calling birds were the four Evangelists who wrote the gospels, etc.
This Christmas song has been subject to parody numerous times and has been covered by multiple musicians, including though not limited to Connie Francis, Natalie Cole, and the Muppets over many years.

Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood

The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (also known as the Pre-Raphaelites) was a group of English painters, poets, and critics, founded in 1848 by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The three founders were soon joined by William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to form a seven-member "brotherhood". After they had broken up, John William Waterhouse painted in their style. Their influence shrank as the impressionists and post-impressionists became more important.

The group's intention was to reform art by rejecting what they considered to be the 'mechanistic approach'. This was first adopted by the Mannerist artists who succeeded Raphael and Michelangelo. The Brotherhood believed that the Classical poses and elegant compositions of Raphael in particular had been a corrupting influence on the academic teaching of art. So, they are called Pre-Raphaelites. 

In particular, they objected to the influence of Sir Joshua Reynolds, the founder of the English Royal Academy of Arts, whom they called "Sir Sloshua". To the Pre-Raphaelites, according to William Michael Rossetti, "sloshy" meant "anything lax or scamped in the process of painting ... and hence ... any thing or person of a commonplace or conventional kind". In contrast, they wanted to return to the abundant detail, intense colours, and complex compositions of Quattrocento Italian and Flemish art.

The Pre-Raphaelites continued to accept the idea of history painting, and the imitation of nature, as central to the purpose of art. Despite this, they were a reform movement: they created a distinct name for their form of art, and published a periodical, "The Germ", to promote their ideas. Their debates were recorded in the "Pre-Raphaelite Journal".

The Brotherhood were highly praised by the art critic John Ruskin, and in turn they were influenced by his ideas. Rossetti's wife Elizabeth Siddal was their favourite model, and she developed into an excellent artist herself.

He amassed a large fortune by making and selling "piccadills" – stiff collars with scalloped edges and a lace border, which were then in fashion. With his great fortune he bought a large tract of what was then open country to the west of London.

After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, Piccadilly and the area to the north (Mayfair) began to be systematically developed as a fashionable residential locality. Some of the grandest mansions in London were built on the northern side of Piccadilly: Clarendon House, Berkeley House (later Devonshire House), and Sir John Denham's house (later Burlington House) were built in the 17th century. Later mansions included Melbourne House (now The Albany), Apsley House, Bath House and Cambridge House. Several members of the Rothschild family had mansions at the western end of the street, and that part was colloquially referred to as Rothschild Row. 

By the 1920s most of these buildings had been demolished or were in institutional use. The enlargement of Park Lane and the formation of Hyde Park Corner as a major traffic gyratory system has cut off the western stretch of Piccadilly, with the result that Apsley House has become detached from it.

21st century Piccadilly is not one of London's principal shopping streets, despite the presence of several famous shops. The Ritz Hotel is in the street, along with some other luxury hotels. There are also some offices and some very expensive flats. Piccadilly is one of the widest and straightest streets in central London.

Last Christmas

"Last Christmas" is a holiday song by the pop duo Wham!. It is about betrayal of the protagonist by a person he thought was there to stay. The song was released in 1984. Other singers have covered it since then, including Ashley Tisdale.

Lock picking

Lock picking is the art of opening a lock without the key and without damaging or destroying the lock or its door. It is usually used by locksmiths to let people back in who have lost their keys or locked them inside a car or house. Lock picking is very rarely used by criminals, because picking a lock is difficult and other ways of entering such as breaking a window are much easier. Some people pick their own locks as a hobby. In most places picking locks that you own is legal, but it is illegal to pick locks that you do not own or do not have permission to pick.

History of keys and locks goes back for about 4,000 years. Ancient people also wanted to protect their possessions and keep them in places where other people cannot get access to them. The first locks and keys were made of wood and other easily accessible materials and they provided the small safeguard against theft or break-in. However, such locks at least let the owners know if someone tried to tamper with the lock. 

The earliest known key and lock was discovered in the Nineveh ruins, which was the capital of ancient Assyria. They were dated to 704 BC. The first models of wooden locks and keys originate from Ancient Babylon and Egypt. These simple devices had small pins, controlling the movement of the security bolt. In order to unlock the bolt, it was necessary to lift the pins, by using bulky wooden keys. 

Roman age introduced many improvements of the Egyptian wooden locks. Ancient Romans created stronger and smaller locks than Egyptians, by using bronze and iron. The keys of locks from Roman era were small and light enough to be carried everywhere. Such small keys were often viewed as one of the effective ways of showing your wealth to other people. Rich Romans often kept their valuable things in secure boxes and wore the keys as finger rings. 

The warded lock also comes from antiquity and is still the most recognizable lock and key type. Nowadays, there is a wide range of different locks, keys and other security systems available on the market. Among them are also keyless entry systems, that allow people to operate their locks without using the keys.

Warded locks are the simplest locks to pick and are picked by inserting a warded lock pick (also called a skeleton key) into the keyhole and turning it as if it were the key. A pick for warded locks can be made by filing down all of the teeth on a regular key except the last one, or for some locks, the last two.
Pin-tumbler and wafer-tumbler locks normally open when the correct key pushes all of the pins or wafers to the shear line. An incorrect key will push the pins or wafers too little or too far. These locks are more difficult to pick than warded locks and are picked by putting tension on the keyhole and pushing the pins or wafers up individually until they reach the shear line. When all of the pins have reached the shear line, the lock will turn as if the key were inserted. Other methods of raising the pins or wafers involve moving an S-shaped pick called a rake through the keyhole to vibrate the pins or wafers to the shear line, or using the pick gun, which bounces the pins to the shear line. It is also possible to pick a pin-tumbler lock with a bump key, which, when struck with a hammer, will bump the pins to the shear line. The force on the hammer should be slightly less than that used for driving a nail, because too much force will break off the head of the key, leaving the rest of the key stuck in the lock. Many newer locks have special pins that make picking more difficult. The special pins are usually spool-shaped and work by wedging into the shear line when pushed up by the pick.

Most padlocks can be opened by inserting a thin piece of metal called a shim between the shackle and the body of the lock. This will need to be done on both sides if there are locking levers on both sides. The shim pushes the locking latch aside and allows the lock to open. High-security padlocks often use a ball-bearing latch, which can not be pushed aside with a shim. Some door locks can be shimmed with a credit card or similar thin plastic object. The card is placed between the door and doorframe, which pushes the latch aside. Combination locks can not be picked, but it is often possible to find the combination by feeling for certain clicks inside the lock, except on certain high-security safe locks. Some combination locks have small cracks through which the parts inside the lock can be seen, allowing the combination to be determined. The Master Lock #175 brass combination lock has a very unique flaw allowing a small piece of metal to be inserted into the bottom of the lock, which pushes the locking bar aside, opening the lock. A special pick exists for disc-detainer locks, but it is only effective on inexpensive locks that do not have false gates. A well-made disc-detainer lock with false gates is considered almost impossible to pick. Lever locks are considered difficult, although possible, to pick and also require a special pick. Tubular locks can be picked with a special tubular pick. Some poorly-made tubular locks can be picked with an ordinary writing pen. Most car locks can be defeated by inserting a metal or plastic rod with a small hook on the end into the area between the rubber seal on the window and the car body, and using the hook to pull the lock lever that is normally pulled by hand from the inside of the car. On most cars, it is possible to electrically connect the switch contacts on the ignition lock to start the car without a key, completely bypassing the mechanical lock. This is called hotwiring the car. Most cars use a wafer-tumbler based lock, so it is also possible to pick the door or ignition locks the traditional way. Some cars, such as many Honda and BMW models, have electronic protection against both hotwiring and traditional picking.

1906 San Francisco earthquake

The 1906 San Francisco earthquake was the biggest earthquake that has ever hit San Francisco on April 18, 1906. It was felt from Los Angeles to Oregon and Nevada. The earthquake was about a 7.8 on the Richter scale. Around 3,000 people were killed and between 227,000 and 300,000 people were left homeless. There were also fires because gas pipes were destroyed, and the gas caught on fire. Over 80% of the city was destroyed by the earthquake and fires that came later. The city is on the San Andreas Fault, which slid, causing the earthquake. Many people looted so then the Army had to come in to keep the peace, but there were reports of the army looting as well.

Piccadilly Circus

Piccadilly Circus is a road junction and public space in London's West End in the City of Westminster.

The Circus links Piccadilly with Regent Street, and the theatres on Shaftesbury Avenue, as well as the Haymarket, Coventry Street (onwards to Leicester Square), and Glasshouse Street. 

The Circus is close to major shopping and entertainment areas in the West End. Its status as a major traffic intersection has made Piccadilly Circus a busy meeting place and a tourist attraction in its own right. 

The Circus is particularly known for its video display and neon signs mounted on the corner building on the northern side, as well as the fountain and statue of an archer popularly known as "Eros". Actually the statue is that of "Anteros", who in legend was the brother of Eros. The fountain is a pedestrian area: it and the Circus there is surrounded by several noted buildings, the London Pavilion and the Criterion Theatre. Directly underneath the plaza is Piccadilly Circus tube station, part of the London Underground system.

Dale–Chall formula

The Dale–Chall formula is one of the ways to predict how difficult text is to read. It is a readability test. The Dale–Chall formula is a one-variable test: it measures the difficulty of the words used. It does not measure the difficulty of the sentence structure (the syntax).

One of the first readability tests, the Dale–Chall formula used a vocabulary list. It counted the number of listed words in a passage, and applied a formula which gave a grade level. It was used to rate textbooks for grade levels in US school districts. In 1995 the authors published an updated word list.

It is easy, in principle, to use a vocabulary list as part of a computer-based readability measure. The list is organised as a look-up table. The percentage of listed words in a passage gives the data for the formula, and the user is presented with a grade level.


Photogram

A photogram is a photograph that is made without a camera. Something is placed on top of some photographic paper (or a similar material) and then shining light on it. At the end of this, you get a shadow picture. It usually has different tones. This depends on how transparent the object is.

Park Lane

Park Lane is a major road in the City of Westminster, in Central London.

Park Lane is about three quarters of a mile (1.2 km) in length, and runs north from Hyde Park Corner to Marble Arch, along the length of the eastern flank of Hyde Park. 

Despite the traffic noise, the road is upmarket. It features five-star hotels, such as The Dorchester, Grosvenor House Hotel and InterContinental London Park Lane Hotel, and showrooms for several makes of high-end sports car. The hotels are part of the area known as Mayfair.

Originally a country lane running north-south along what is now the eastern boundary of Hyde Park, it became a fashionable residential address from the eighteenth century onwards. It has views across Hyde Park and a position at the most fashionable western edge of London. It became lined with some of the largest privately owned mansions in London, including the Duke of Westminster's Grosvenor House and the Holford family's Dorchester House (demolished in 1929 and replaced by 1931 with The Dorchester, which are now both hotels, and the Marquess of Londonderry's Londonderry House, which has been demolished. 

On a corner with Oxford Street, Somerset House (No. 40), built in 1769-70, was successively the town house of Warren Hastings, a former Governor-General of India, the third Earl of Rosebery, and the Dukes of Somerset.

In the 1960s the Lane was widened to three lanes each way either side of a central reservation. This required the demolition of a number of houses at Hyde Park Corner. It claimed land previously in Hyde Park to make room for the multi-lane carriageway. The result was to diminish the appeal of Park Lane as a residential address, as it became one of the busiest and noisiest roads in central London. It has little or none of the countryside atmosphere that once made it popular. The widening of the road distanced the houses on the east side of Park Lane from Hyde Park itself, access to which is now by underpass.

Alghero

Alghero (Italian pronunciation: [alˈɡɛro]; , IPA: [ɫəɫˈɣe], locally: [lalˈɣe]; ; ), is a city of about 44,000 citizens in Italy. It lies in the province of Sassari in northwestern Sardinia, next to the sea.

In the 1930s, the Swedish writer Amelie Posse Brazdova wrote a book entitled "Sardinia Side Show", where she told the complete story of 2 years she spent "interned" in Alghero old town during World War I.


Triangulation station

A triangulation station is a fixed surveying station, used in surveying. 

It may also be known as a triangulation pillar, trigonometrical station, trigonometrical point, trig station, trig beacon or trig point, and sometimes informally as a trig,

The names of triangulation stations vary regionally; they are generally known as "trigonometrical stations" in North America, "trig points" in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia, and "trig beacons" in South Africa; "triangulation pillar" is the more formal term for the concrete columns found in the UK.

Pope Leo XI

Pope Leo XI (; 2 June 1535 – 27 April 1605), born Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici, was an Italian priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 233rd Pope for only 26 days in April 1605. 

He was born in Florence. His grandmother was a sister of Leo X. 

In 1567, Medici was ordained as a priest.

In 1569, Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, sent Father Medici to be the ambassador of Florence in the court of Pope Pius V. For 15 years in Rome, Father Medici was the representative of the city and the Medici family.

Gregory XIII made him Bishop of Pistoia in 1573. He was named Archbishop of Florence in 1574.

Gregory raised him to the rank of cardinal in 1583.

In 1596, Clement VIII sent Cardinal Medici as ambassador to the court of Henry IV of France. 

On 1 April 1605, Cardinal Medici was elected pope. He chose to be called Leo XI in honor of his uncle Pope Leo X. 

When he was elected, Leo XI was almost seventy years of age, and he died within the month. His death came as a result of fatigue and cold in the ceremony of taking possession of the Basilica of St John Lateran. He was called "Papa Lampo" ("Lightning Pope") because his papacy was so short.



TSG 1899 Hoffenheim

TSG 1899 Hoffenheim is a football club based in Hoffenheim, a suburb of Sinsheim, Baden-Württemberg. They play in the German Bundesliga In the year 2000 they played in the 5th division but in 2008 they promoted to the Bundesliga. It was possible with the financial help of the software mogul Dietmar Hopp, who had played in the club's youth system. The financial help was widely criticized by other clubs, fans and by some in the German press. The most important points were the lack of tradition and the small fan base. Hoffenheim has only 3,300 inhabitants, and Sinsheim, where they play their home games, has only about 35,000 residents.

Mimosa pudica

Mimosa pudica is a 
well-known species of "Mimosa". It is a creeping annual or perennial herb often grown for its curiosity value: the compound leaves fold inward and droop when touched or shaken, re-opening minutes later. The species is native to South America and Central America, but is now a widespread weed.

The stem is erect in young plants, but becomes creeping or trailing with age. The leaves of the "Mimosa pudica" are compound leaves.

The leaves are bipinnately compound, with one or two pinnae pairs, and 10-26 leaflets per pinna. The round-shaped flower heads, which are inflorescences, are 8–10 mm in diameter (excluding the stamens). The floret petals are red in their upper part and the filaments are pink to lavender. The fruit consists of clusters of 2-8 pods from 1–2 cm long each. The pods break into 2-5 segments and contain pale brown seeds some 2.5 mm long. The flowers are pollinated by the wind and insects. The seeds have hard seed coats which restrict germination.

"Mimosa pudica" is well known for its rapid plant movement.
Like a number of other plant species, it undergoes changes in leaf orientation termed "sleep". The foliage closes during darkness and reopens in light.

The leaves also close when touched, warmed, blown, or shaken. When the plant is disturbed, specific regions on the stems release potassium ions which force water out of the cell vacuoles. The water diffuses out of the cells, producing a loss of cell pressure and cell collapse; this differential turgidity between different regions of cells results in the closing of the leaflets and the collapse of the leaf petiole. This is quite a common trait in the Mimosoideae subfamily of the legume family, Fabaceae. The stimulus can also be transmitted to neighbouring leaves. The function of this trait is not known. The plant may use its ability as a defense from predators. Animals may be afraid of a fast moving plant and would rather eat a less active one. Another possible explanation is that the sudden movement dislodges harmful insects.

Muhammad Ali Pasha

Muhammad Ali Pasha, also known as Muhammad Ali of Egypt and the Sudan (, , ; ; ; 4 March 1769 – 2 August 1849) was a Turkish and Albanian commander in the Ottoman army and governor of the province of Egypt. He became Wāli, and self-declared Khedive of Egypt and Sudan.

Though not a modern nationalist, he was the founder of modern Egypt because of the dramatic reforms he made to the army, economy, and culture of Egypt. He also ruled some Levantine territories outside Egypt. The dynasty he established ruled Egypt and Sudan until the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.

Muhammed Ali was born in the Ottoman Empire, in Kavala, a city in the area which is now the Greek province of Macedonia. His ancestors migrated from a village of İliç in Eastern Turkey. Some historians claim he was an Albanian but it's wrong. He led a group of Albanian troops sent to Egypt. They were part of an Ottoman force that reoccupied Egypt after Napoleon's French troops left. The Ottomans had ruled Egypt by a Wali (Governor) with Mamluk troops. The Mamluks were former slaves.

The French Capitulation of Alexandria left a power vacuum in the Ottoman province. Mamluk power had been weakened, but not destroyed, and Ottoman forces clashed with the Mamluks for power. During this period of anarchy Muhammad Ali used his loyal Albanian troops to play both sides, gaining power and prestige for himself. As the conflict drew on, the local populace grew weary of the power struggle. A group of prominent Egyptians demanded that the then Wāli, Ahmad Khurshid Pasha, step down and Muhammad Ali be installed as the new Wāli in 1805.

The Mamluks were still powerful, so in 1811 he massacred their leaders and sent troops to chase the followers out of Egypt.

Muhammad Ali’s goal was to establish a powerful, European-style state. To do that, he had to reorganize Egyptian society, streamline the economy, train a professional bureaucracy, and build a modern military.

In practice, Muhammad Ali’s land reform amounted to a monopoly on trade in Egypt. He required all producers to sell their goods to the state. The state in turn resold Egyptian goods, and kept the surplus. This was very profitable for Egypt, especially with their cotton, which was of high quality. The new-found profits also extended down to the individual farmers, as the average wage increased fourfold.

Beyond building a more modern economy, Muhammad Ali started to train a professional military and bureaucracy. He sent promising men to Europe to study. Students were sent to study European languages, primarily French, so they could translate military manuals into Arabic. He then used both educated Egyptians and imported European experts to establish schools and hospitals in Egypt. European education also provided talented Egyptians with social mobility. Bright boys from poor families could work their way up, and become successful.

A byproduct of Muhammad Ali’s training program was the establishment of a Civil service. Establishing an efficient central bureaucracy was needed for Muhammad Ali’s other reforms. In the process of destroying the Mamluks, the Wāli had to fill the posts that the Mamluks had previously filled. He divided Egypt into ten provinces, each leader responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining order. Muhammad Ali installed his sons in most key positions; however, his reforms did offer Egyptians opportunities beyond agriculture and industry.

He loved Arabian horse, he built a very big Horsestud in Egypt at Shoubra, and from this Horses, they are descendants until today.

At the start, Muhammad Ali waged war on behalf of the Ottoman Sultan, Mahmud II, in Arabia and Greece. Later, he came into open conflict with the Ottoman Empire.

His first military campaign was an expedition into the Arabian Peninsula. The holy cities of Mecca, and Medina had been captured by the House of Saud, who held a form of Islam called Wahhabism. Armed with their new religious zeal, the Muhammad ibn Saud began conquering parts of Arabia.

With the main Ottoman army busy in Europe, Mahmud II turned to Muhammad Ali to recapture the Arabian territories. Muhammad Ali in turn appointed his son, Tosun Pasha, to lead a military expedition in 1811. The campaign was turned back in Arabia; however, a second attack was launched in 1812 that recaptured Hejaz. After a two-year campaign, the Saudis were crushed and most of the Saudi family was captured. The family leader, Abdullah ibn Saud, was sent to Istanbul, and executed.

Muhammad Ali next turned his attention to military campaigns of his own design, beginning with the Sudan which he viewed as a valuable addition of territory, gold, and slaves. Sudan at the time had no real central authority and used primitive weaponry in its tribal infighting.

In 1820 Muhammad Ali dispatched an army of 5,000 troops commanded by his third son, Ismail, south into Sudan with the intent of conquering the territory and subjugating it to his authority. Ali's troops made headway into Sudan in 1821, but met with fierce resistance. Ultimately, Egyptian troops and firearms ensured the conquest of Sudan. Ali now had an outpost from which he could expand to the source of the Nile in Ethiopia, and Uganda. His administration captured slaves from the Sudan, who were then made into a foot regiment of soldiers. Ali's harsh reign in Sudan, and that of his immediate successors, led eventually to the popular independence struggle of the self-proclaimed Mahdi, Muhammed Ahmed, in 1881.

As Muhammad Ali was expanding his authority into Africa, the Ottoman Empire faced ethnic rebellions in its European territories. The Greek rebellion against Ottoman rule began in 1821. The Ottoman army failed to put down the revolt, and ethnic violence spread as far as Constantinople. Sultan Mahmud II offered Muhammad Ali the island of Crete in exchange for his support in putting down the revolt.

Muhammed Ali sent 16,000 soldiers, 100 transports, and 63 escort vessels under command of his son, Ibrahim Pasha.. Britain, France, and Russia intervened to protect the Greeks. On 20 October 1827 at the Navarino, the entire Egyptian navy was sunk by the European Allied fleet under the command of Admiral Edward Codrington (1770–1851). Muhammad Ali suffered the loss of his competent, expensive navy. With its fleet destroyed, Egypt had no way to support its forces in Greece and was forced to withdraw. Ultimately the campaign cost Muhammad Ali his navy for no gains.

To compensate for his and Egypt's losses, the conquest of Syria was set in motion. Like other rulers of Egypt before him, Ali desired to control the Levant, both for its strategic value and for its rich natural resources. Not only had Syria abundant natural resources, it also had a thriving international trading community with well-developed markets throughout the Levant. It would be a captive market for the goods now being produced in Egypt. Perhaps best of all, Syria was desirable as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman Sultan.

A new fleet was built, a new army was raised and on 31 October 1831, under Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian invasion of Syria started the First Turko-Egyptian War. The Egyptians overran most of Syria with ease. The strongest and only really significant resistance was put up at the port city of Acre. The Egyptian force eventually captured the city after a six-month siege. Unrest on the Egyptian home front increased during the course of the siege. Ali was forced to squeeze Egypt more and more to support his campaign, and his people resented the increased burden.

After the fall of Acre, the Egyptian army marched north into Anatolia. At the Battle of Konya (21 December 1832), Ibrahim Pasha soundly defeated the Ottoman army led by the Grand Vizier Reshid Pasha. There were now no military obstacles between Ibrahim's forces and Constantinople itself.

Through the course of the campaign, Muhammad Ali watched the European powers carefully. Fearing another intervention that would reverse all his gains, he proceeded slowly and cautiously. For example, he continued the practice of using the Sultan’s name at Friday prayers in the newly captured territories. He continued to circulate Ottoman coins instead of issuing new ones bearing his likeness. So long as Muhammad Ali’s march did not threaten the complete collapse of the Ottoman state, the powers in Europe remained passive observers.

Despite this show, Muhammad Ali's goal was now to remove the current Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II and replace him with the sultan's son, the infant Abdülmecid. This possibility so alarmed Mahmud II that he accepted Russia's offer of military aid. This led to the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi. Russia's gain dismayed the British and French governments, so they worked for a negotiated solution. In May 1833 the Convention of Kutahya was signed.

The terms of the peace were that Muhammad Ali would withdraw his forces from Anatolia and receive the territories of Crete and the Hejaz as compensation. Ibrahim Pasha would be appointed Wāli of Syria. The peace agreement fell short, however, of granting Muhammad Ali an independent kingdom for himself, leaving him wanting.

Bayesian probability

Bayesian probability figures out the likelihood that something will happen based on available evidence. This is different from frequency probability which determines the likelihood something will happen based on how often it occurred in the past.

You might use Bayesian probability if you don't have information on how often the event happened in the past.
As an example, say you want to classify an email as "spam" or "not spam". One thing you know about this email is that it has an emoji in the subject line. Say it's the year 2017, and 80% of the emails you got with emoji in them were spam. So you can look at an email with emoji in the subject and say it's 80% likely to be spam.

But if only 1% of your emails were spam and 80% of the emojis were spam, that's different than if half your emails are spam and 80% of emoji emails were spam.

Then you can use Bayes's Theorem to determine one probability of whether this email is spam: 

p (is_spam | contains_emoji) = [ p(contains_emoji | is_spam) * p(is_spam) ] / p(contains_emoji)

P(xy) = P(xy) * Px / Py

Dani Rodrik

Dani Rodrik (born August 14, 1957 in Istanbul, Turkey) is a Turkish economist in the fields of international economics, economic development and political economy.
He is a professor of economics at John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, where he teaches economics to university students.

Dani Rodrik was born in Istanbul, Turkey to a Sephardic Jewish (Jews who come from Spain) family. 
He studied at the high schools, Robert College in Istanbul and École Normale Supérieure in Paris and then at the universities, Harvard University and Princeton University in the United States of America learning economics. He graduated from Harvard University and got his Ph.D. and Professorship from Princeton University.

Dani Rodrik is one of the most important Turkish economists and has made several important contributions to economics. He looks at international economics, economic development and political economy, and has published many articles about them. The main questions of his research are: what makes a good economic policy and why some governments are better than others in adopting it.

He does not like globalization, because he feels it only helps rich people get richer by making poor people poorer and that people lose their jobs. He also thinks that international organizations like the World Bank and the IMF have made it harder for poorer countries to get richer, or even do not allow them to get richer. He writes critical articles against globalization.

Knights of St. Patrick

The Knights of St. Patrick is a British order of chivalry associated with Ireland. Founded by King George III of Great Britain and Ireland in 1783. Irish-born British General Herbert Kitchener was a Knight of St. Patrick 

George III

King George III (born "George William Frederick", 4 June 1738 29 January 1820) was King of Great Britain and Ireland from 25 October 1760 to 1 January 1801, when he became King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until his death. He was also Elector of Hanover, which made him a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire.

During George's reign, he lost control of the United States of America however the British Empire made major gains in South Asia. His two kingdoms, Great Britain and Ireland, were merged into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Also during his reign, the British were at war with republican and Napoleon I's France. The Electorate of Hanover eventually became a Kingdom.

George suffered from periodic bouts of mental illness. One of them caused a crisis in 1788, and attempts were made to nominate his son George IV as regent. The king quickly recovered and prevented that from happening.

George signed the Quebec Act of 1774, which abolished William III's anti-Catholic laws in the American colonies. Also during his reign, George III signed legislation abolishing some of the anti-Catholic Laws in Great Britain and Ireland. For example, the Catholic Relief Acts of 1772 and 1774 allowed Roman Catholics to have land leases in Great Britain. In 1793, Hogart's Act allowed Roman Catholics to vote in Irish elections, but George blocked a proposal in 1800 to allow Catholics to sit in the British Parliament.

In the later part of his life, George suffered from recurrent mental illness, which was eventually permanent. Although it has since been suggested that he suffered from a genetic blood disease, porphyria, the cause of his illness is not certain. After a final relapse in 1810, a regency was established, and George's eldest son, George, Prince of Wales, ruled as Prince Regent. On George III's death, the Prince Regent succeeded his father as George IV.

Because of "his plain, homely, thrifty manners and tastes", George III has had the nickname of "Farmer George".

Abercrombie River

The Abercrombie River is a river in New South Wales, Australia. It flows west from Mount Werong to the Wyangala Dam near Cowra. The river is a tributary of the Lachlan, which it joins at Wyangala lake.

The Abercrombie River is in length, and passes through the Abercrombie River National Park. It provides habitat for platypus and rakali. The Goulburn-Oberon Road crosses the Abercrombie River in the steep-sided Abercrombie Gorge.

The first people to live alongside the river were Aborigines of the Wiradjuri and Gundungara tribes. They may have used the river as a trading route. The first European to visit the river was explorer Charles Throsby on 5 May 1819, during an expedition from Sydney to the Central West of New South Wales. Alluvial gold was discovered in and along the river in 1851. This started a small gold rush. It was difficult to find gold because of the rough terrain, and changing water levels in the river. Early miners found up to of gold a day along the river. By 1862 about 45 mining parties were working at Milburne Creek, a minor tributary of the Abercrombie. 
It is the furthest east of the inland flowing rivers.

Abercrombie River National Park

Abercrombie River National Park is a national park in New South Wales, Australia. It is west of Sydney. The Abercrombie and Retreat Rivers flow through the park. The park protects a large area of open forest, the largest area in this part of New South Wales. There are large trees, Casuarina cunninghamia, growing along the river. The river is normally a series of deep waterholes. In the park there are platypuses, rakalis, wallaroos, red-necked wallabies, swamp wallabies and Eastern Grey Kangaroos.


Rakali

The rakali ("Hydromys chrysogaster"), also known as the water-rat, is an Australian native rodent. The species lives in burrows on the banks of rivers, lakes and estuaries. It feeds on aquatic insects, fish, crustaceans, mussels, snails, frogs, birds' eggs and water birds. Rakali are in length with a thick tail measuring around . They weigh . They have webbed hind legs, waterproof fur, a flattened head, a long blunt nose, many whiskers and small ears and eyes. They are black to brown in colour with an orange to white belly, and dark tail with a white tip.

Until the 1980s, this species was commonly known as water-rat. During the 1990s there was a push for English common names to be replaced with indigenous names. In 1995 the Australian Nature Conservation Agency recommended that the name rakali be used as the common name. The Australian Department of Environment and Heritage has taken up this suggestion and both common names are now used.

Battle of White Mountain

The Battle of White Mountain happened in 1620 and was the first battle of the Thirty Years' War. It had Duke Maximilian I of Bavaria defeat the forces of Frederick V, Elector of Palantine, King of Bohemia and Moravia. 

The cause of the battle was a revolt by a group of Czech lords who threw two governors and a secretary out of the windows of Prague Castle. The incident is known as the Defenestration of Prague. The rebels quickly built up an army of 30,000 to make an independent Protestant country. The Czechs were defeated by a well-trained Imperial army after a battle lasting less than one hour. Emperor Ferdinand II replaced Frederick as King of Bohemia and then killed many who had opposed him. Others were given a choice to convert to Catholicism or to leave the country.

White Mountain is now in the city of Prague. There is an open space and monument.

Gansus

Gansus is a genus of aquatic birds that lived during the Lower Cretaceous period, between 115 to 105 million years ago (mya). It was found in what is now Gansu province, western China. It is the oldest-known of the Ornithurae, the group which includes modern birds (Neornithes) and extinct related groups, such as "Confuciusornis", "Ichthyornis" and "Hesperornis".

The genus "Gansus" contains a single species, "G. yumenensis", which was about the size of a pigeon and similar in appearance to loons and diving ducks.

"Gansus" was discovered in the form of a single fossil foot in 1981. Five more well-preserved fossils were found in 2003–2004 in mudstone at the site of an ancient lake at Changma, Gansu; the geological stratum in which the fossils were found is the Xiagou Formation. Their bodies had settled in anoxic mud and were soon covered with further extremely fine silty sediments. Without oxygen, their remains resisted decay: these specimens preserved remains of flight feathers and traces of the webbing between their toes.

This City

"This City" is the first solo mainstream radio single released by American pop singer-songwriter Patrick Stump off the debut album "Soul Punk" under Island Def Jam Records on July 26, 2011 on his blog. The song features American rapper and songwriter and producer Lupe Fiasco. The original track does not feature Fiasco's addition to the rap versus in the single. In January 2010, Stump announced that he was producing his debut solo album, titled "Soul Punk". This came after Fall Out Boy (his main band)'s hiatus in late 2009. His album is a complete solo effort as he is doing everything: performing, composing all music, penning all lyrics, playing over ten instruments and producing, with the album's recording is funded by his own Fall Out Boy earnings. Its musical direction is generally pop/R&B orientated and has been described by Stump as "soul punk" and "smart pop," drawing influence from a wide scope of artists including Prince, Michael Jackson and David Bowie. According to Stump, the song changed the entire course of "Soul Punk". "I had written a while draft of the album and then at the 11th hour came up with "This City," I really loved the song but felt like, conceptually, it didn't fit on the album. I had to go back and make an album for that song because I loved it so much. So one of the holdups on [the album] was re-writing the record around [it]." With "Soul Punk" originally due in February 2011, Stump delayed it to October 18 and rebuilt the album with the song, releasing "Truant Wave" EP in the meanwhile for its delay in February 2011. "I had this feeling that the album was disjointed, and right before I was mastering, I played "This City" for my manager — I really liked it, but I was unsure about it, although I thought it was what I wanted to say — and he was like, 'Put it on, it's great! Then I thought, 'Well, if I'm going to put that on the record, then I really need to go back to the drawing board.' Basically I took "This City", "Everybody Wants Somebody", "Allie", and a song called "Dance Miserable", and rebuilt the album around those four songs."

A music video for the remix has been released, directed by Ken Koller. On September 13, Patrick Stump announced that the music video for "This City" (remix) would premiere on September 20 on Vevo with a teaser on Idolitor. Prior to that he Tweeted about the video in the making Twitter and a behind-the-scenes clip was reported by MTV on their website. The video features Stump dancing and performing the song in a room with flashing lights, projections and heavy use of special effects, alternating with brief grayscale flashes of a city. Despite not being available at first, Lupe Fiasco appears for one scene by himself. Stump and Koller made the video simplistic to let the music do the talking rather than the video.

"There's not really a plot, there's not really a story to it. The song's called 'This City,' and it describes a lot of these images in a city, and I feel like those images are already there; it would be kind of redundant to take a camera into a city; it's almost like the colors and the lights and the images that are going to be around this are going to be representing the life in a city. One thing that Ken and I were talking about is that a city is so complicated, so ... we wanted to do something a bit different with it, and a bit more abstract [...] the treatment was really funny to look at; it was literally one sentence, like 'Patrick stands in a room and sings and we project all these images and lights on the walls.'"—Stump, reported by MTV.

Ornithurae

Ornithurae (meaning 'bird tails' in Greek) is the name of a natural group which includes all modern birds as well as their extinct relatives with plough-shaped pygostyles (†Ichthyornis, †Hesperornithes, †Limenavis). This is a bone at the end of the tail which allows the tail feathers to fan and retract. "Gansus", from the Lower Cretaceous of China is the earliest known at 110 million years ago.

Simple classification:

Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener

Field Marshal Horatio Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener KG, KP, GCB, OM, GCSI, GCMG, GCIE, ADC, PC (24 June 1850 – 4 June 1916) was an Irish born British Field Marshal.

Kitchener was Sirdar (British Commander in Chief) of the Egyptian Army. He defeated the Mahdist rebels against Egyptian rule in 1898 and conquered the Sudan for Britain and (nominally) Egypt.

He was Chief of Staff during the Boer War of 1899–1902. From 1899–1900 he was also Commander-in-Chief of the forces in southern Africa. He was given many orders of chivalry, both British and foreign, including Knight of St. Patrick and Knight of the Garter.

At the start of the First World War, Prime Minister Asquith appointed Lord Kitchener Secretary of State for War. A massive recruitment campaign began for the New Armies, also called "Kitchener's Army". His image was used in a famous advertisement. Kitchener was drowned in 1916 when the HMS Hampshire sunk near the Orkney Islands after hitting a German mine.

Anglo-Egyptian Sudan

Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was the name of the Sudan when it was a colony of the United Kingdom and Egypt. It was officially under the joint rule of both countries, but the British controlled the government from the beginning. Every Governor was British, and all decisions about the country were made by the British, but many of the administrators of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan were Egyptians. The Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was created in 1899 when the Egyptian Army under Herbert Kitchener recaptured the Sudan, which was before an Egyptian colony, from the Mahdists, a group of Islamic rebels against Egypt. 

Before focusing on the Anglo-Egyptian condominium in Sudan, it is essential to know that Sudan was already a part of Egypt since 1820. Egypt was then part of the Ottoman empire. 

Muhammad Ali came to power in Egypt in 1805 to defeat the Mamluks by 1812. The Mamluks were invited to the inauguration of Ahmad Pasha as commander. After the event at the Citadel of Cairo, the Egyptian ruler Muhammad Ali commanded his army to kill all the Mamluks. The ones that survived the massacre fled southwards to a village in Sudan called Dongola, where they formed a community. 

This Mamluk settlement was the main reason for Ali to invade Sudan; he feared that they were preparing to come back to Egypt soon and topple the ruler. But this was certainly not the only reason for Muhammad Ali to take over their neighboring country. He was also highly interested in the enslaved Sudanese people. Ali decided to modernize Egypt when he took control of it in 1805, this included building a big army, but he had not enough human resources to achieve this.

After years of exploration by Egyptian officials in Upper Egypt and Sudan, the invasion began in 1820. The conquest can be divided into two different parts. The first one was led by the son of Muhammad Ali, Isma'ili Kamal Pasha, and had the aim to take control of the Nile Bassin and Sennar. Muhammad Bay Khusawr Al Dafardaar conducted the second conquest that began a year later; he was also related to Mohammed Ali because he married the daughter of Mohammed Ali's wife. His goal was to conquer the Darfur region which is the southwestern part of Sudan. 

Ali’s goal of creating an army consisting of enslaved people was not achieved. But with his invasion, he dismantled possible opponents. The situation in Sudan was calm after their uprising was suppressed. The next big rebellion was the Mahdist revolt.

In 1881, the Mahdist Revolt broke out in the Sudan. This revolt was similar in nature to the ‘Urabi revolt in lower Egypt, however experienced by the British as more fanatical. It was centered around the Sufi scholar Muhammad Ahmad who assumed Mahdiship and started a revolution from Kordofan against Egypt. From Kordofan he conquered most of modern-day Sudan and South Sudan.

After the Mahdist takeover, the Sudanese economy was destroyed first by the war and later by famine and oppression. The Mahdi declared that anyone that criticized his mahdiship as unfaithful was considered an unbeliever (kāfir). The Mahdist state also continued to fight a jihad against Egypt and opposition within his state.

The reconquest of Sudan was achieved with Egyptian military and finance; this was on demand of Great Britain. Other European powers, like France, Italy, and Belgium that were active in the region, were also interested in annexing or acquiring Sudanese territory. The most famous example is the Fashoda Incident, the French Captain Marchand occupied the military post of Fashoda in southern Sudan on 10 July 1898. Kitchener, who was the governor-general, was furious and immediately sent out the army to defeat the French.

The military problem had now been solved; the political issue awaited a solution. At first, it was unclear which form of government was to be applied to the Sudan. Because the country had to be sufficiently Egyptian to meet the political requirements and enough British to avoid any administration problems. 

In 1898 a solution was found. On 19 January and 10 July of that year, the Condominium Agreement was signed by Lord Cromer on the British side and Boutros Pasha Ghali on the Egyptian side, he was the Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time. A condominium means that a territory is held by two powers, in this case Egypt and Great Britain. For Sudan, it meant that it became an independent state, but with the rights of the two powers, Great Britain and Egypt merged into it. 

The agreement intends to guarantee the predominance of Great Britain in Sudan in the interests of the Sudanese, Egypt, and herself. The main points in the deal were as follows; Firstly, the flags of the two sovereign powers were to be hoisted next to each other.

The second key point is about the British control of the administrative structure given in Articles III and IV of the agreement. Article III says that the Governor-General of Sudan, who is appointed by the Khedive, is responsible for the civil and military command of the country. The other one, Article IV, gives the same Governor-General complete control over legislative powers, which means that he can make or change laws. Kitchener was, as aforementioned, the first governor-general; later, in 1899, Sir Reginald Wingate was appointed. 

Lastly, the appointment of Consuls in the Sudan must be made in consultation with Britain.

Egypt’s interest in Sudan is twofold. The first one is security; by controlling Sudan in a condominium with Great Britain, they remove threats coming from the south. The second and biggest reason for their interest is the Nile. Lord Cromer and his administration wanted to secure the Upper Nile, one reason for this was to have enough water for their important cotton production in Egypt.

When the British reclaimed Sudan, they implemented several changes in their religious and political policies. 

They were to focus on three main goals. The first of which was the separation of religion and state, as was the norm in other colonies. Another was the expulsion of the remaining Mahdist forces. This was, partially, done through condemnation of Sufism. Nevertheless, revolts did break out, which were gradually put down over time. A third goal was to gain more control over southern tribal areas, which had been under loose control in the past.

The differentiated British policies for missionary activities from those in the south. In the north, orthodox Islam was encouraged, and therefore missionary activity would be mostly prohibited. In southern tribal territories, however, it would be allowed, as they were perceived to be pagans by the British.

When Britain and the Ottoman Empire assumed opposing sides in the first world war, Britain declared Egypt as a protectorate. This was done because Egypt was, although very autonomous, still technically a province of the Ottoman Empire. Sudan was now the most British it had been.

Wingate managed to get the support of many Sudanese people. He did this by allowing more Sufism and using lingering hate against the Ottomans in Sudan to get the support of the remaining Mahdi sympathizers. Which, in turn, meant that the previous efforts to prioritize traditional Islam had failed.

After the first world war, Egyptian nationalism greatly increased. There was a fear that if the Egyptians were to gain independence, they would also claim Sudan. Therefore, the British tried to gain Sudanese support by speaking to local leaders and prominent figures. One son of the Mahdi, ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi, was becoming increasingly pro-British after the first world war and would pledge his sword to the British crown in 1919. The British now had generally better relations with the Sudanese religious elite given the Mahdist threat was mostly on their side now.

However, Egyptian nationalism had mainly affected the educated middle-class Sudanese-Egyptian people. These nationalists were led by ‘Ali ‘Abd al-Latif, who started several political movements demanding sovereignty for Sudan. This led to protests and his arrest in 1922 and 1924. After his second arrest, more violent protests would take place, this led to the expulsion of Egyptian troops from Sudan.

In the 1930s, British influence appeared to be diminishing, partially because the Anglo-Egyptian treaty had been signed in 1936, making the relations between the two states more consolable. However, there was not much agreed upon about the territory of Sudan and who would rule it, with many of the same disputes still existing in the background. Nationalism had also started to grow in recent years, and in 1938 the first Sudanese representation came into being with the establishment of the Graduates’ General Congress.

The Sudanese independence was a consequence of the coup by the Free Officers in Egypt in 1952. This coup, led by Mohammad Naguib and general Gamal Abdel Nasser, overthrew the Egyptian Monarchy.

In the Sudan, the voice of nationalists had risen since a few years already. Different political parties were formed, some aimed to be fully independent and other to unite with Egypt. One of the parties that strived for independence was the Umma Nation Party, created in 1945. Britain and Egypt were aware of this rise of nationalism. Britain set up an advisory council in the northern part of the country, giving the Umma party the lead over it. 

Mohammad Naguib, half Sudanese, met the Sudanese political leader to suggest self-governance and later self-determination. On 10 January 1953, the agreement giving the Sudan ‘self-government statute’ was signed by both countries. 

This was seen as a transitional period that was limited to a maximum of 3 years; after this, it was decided whether Sudan was to be linked to Egypt in any form or become independent. 

The second option was chosen, and the parliament was the country's first self-governing institution. In 1954 elections were held, and Ismail Azhari won. He was the leader of the National Unionist Party; he wanted to get rid of the British control in Sudan. Azhari was for the unity of Egypt and Sudan, but this changed once he was elected as prime minister.
On 19 December 1955, the House of Representatives passed a resolution for the country's independence. On 1 January 1956, Sudan was officially independent, the Egyptian and British flags were lowered, and the new Sudanese flag was hoisted. This was the end of the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium.

Condominium (international law)

Condominium means a colony ruled jointly by two or more countries. Examples include the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, which was in name under the joint rule of the United Kingdom and Egypt, although in fact a British colony with all political decisions up to the British despite having many Egyptians involved in administering the country, and New Hebrides, which was under the joint rule of the UK and France.

Neornithes

Neornithes are the most recent common ancestor of all living birds and all their descendants. There are about 9,000 to 10,000 known living species in the world.

Modern birds are divided into two superorders; the Palaeognathae (tinamous and flightless ratites), and the Neognathae, containing all other birds.

It is generally agreed that the Neornithes evolved in the Cretaceous and that the split between the Palaeognathae and Neognathae, and then the split between two subgroups of Neognathae, Galloanserae and Neoaves, occurred before the K-Pg extinction event. However, fossils that can be unequivocally assigned to the Neognathae, such as "Vegavis" and "Asteriornis" do not appear in the fossil record until the very end of the Cretaceous.

However, there are different opinions about whether the radiation within these major groups occurred before or after the extinction of dinosaurs. The only Cretaceous fossils that can be unequivocally assigned to the Neognathae are "Vegavis" and "Asteriornis", two early members of the Galloanseres that corroborate the early diversification of this groups before the K-Pg extinction event. But the fossil record of Neoaves is restricted to post K-Pg times. Molecular dating have produced a wide range of dates for the rapid early diversification of Neoaves, from the late Cretaceous to the early Paleogene, with some studies suggesting that the rapid radiation largely coincided with the extinction event.

Antipope

Antipope is a term of the Roman Catholic Church in the context of its official list of popes. An antipope is not included in the list of popes in the Vatican's annual directory, "Annuario Pontificio"

An antipope is a pretender who falsely claims to be pope or who wrongly opposes the legitimate and recognized pope.

The existence or claims of an antipope produces a schism in the Roman Catholic Church. A conflict is caused by those who are opposing the authority of the pope.


Neognathae

Neognathae are birds in the subclass Neornithes. The Neognathae include almost all living birds: their sister taxon Palaeognathae has just the tinamou and the flightless ratites.

There are nearly 10,000 species of neognaths. Since the Cretaceous they have undergone an adaptive radiation. This has produced the variety of form, function, and behavior which we see today. The Passeriformes (perching birds) are the largest order of land vertebrates. They are some 60% of living birds.

The neognaths have fused hand bones, an elongate third finger, and 13 or fewer vertebrae. They differ from the Palaeognathae in features like the structure of their jawbones. "Neognathae" means "new jaws" but, ironically, paleognath jaws are one of the few derived) features of that group.

Treaty of Northampton

The Treaty of Northampton signed in 1328 was an agreement between England and Scotland that recognised Scotland as an independent country and Robert the Bruce as its king. Edward I of England and his son Edward II had been fighting wars against Robert the Bruce for more than 20 years. Edward II believed that he was the rightful King of Scotland. In 1327, Edward II was forced from his throne by his wife, Isabella of France and her lover, Roger Mortimer. Edward's young son, Edward III became King of England at the age of 15. Robert the Bruce saw a chance in the confusion in England and immediately sent James Douglas to attack the north of England. The English, scared that they would lose, wanted a peace treaty. The Treaty of Northampton secured peace between the two countries. As part of the treaty, Edward II's six year old daughter, Joan of the Tower was married to Robert's four year old son, David II.

Sudan People's Liberation Movement

Sudan's people liberation army (SPLA) and Sudan's people liberation movement is a political party in South Sudan. It was founded as a resistance movement / rebel group in 1963. As Sudan's people liberation army, it fought against the Sudanese government, in the Sudanese Civil War. This war ended in 2005. Officially, the movement wanted to create a free secular Sudan, which it called "New Sudan". In reality, however, many people in the movement wanted to create an independent state, South Sudan. In 2005, there was a peace treaty. From that moment, until 2011, the SPLM was part of the Sudanese government. Since the independence of South Sudan in 2011, the SPLM is de facto the only party in the country. In the south, the SPLA will become the regular army. In the north, the SPLM is still part of the government. In the provinces South Kordofan and Blue Nile, the SPLA is one of the armies fighting the government.

Stephen Bathory

Stephen Báthory (27 September 1533 – 12 December 1586) was a Hungarian Prince of Transylvania (1571–1586), then King of Poland (1576–1586) and Grand Duke of Lithuania (1576–1586).

The son of Stephen VIII Báthory and a member of the Báthory family. He was married to Queen Anna Jagiellon and worked closely with Chancellor Jan Zamoyski. During his reign, he focused on consolidating power, defeating rivals like Maximilian II, the Holy Roman Emperor, and quelling rebellions, including the Danzig rebellion. He had a successful reign, especially in military matters. His most significant accomplishment was his victorious campaign against Russia in Livonia, where he defended the Commonwealth's borders and secured a favorable peace treaty called the Peace of Jam Zapolski.

Stephen Báthory was born on 27 September 1533, in Szilágysomlyó, Hungary. His father was Stephen VIII Báthory, and mother was Catherine Telegdi. He had two brothers and three sisters.

Around 1549–1550, he was studied in Italy. He later joined the army of the Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor and fought against the Turks. He was captured by the Turks after 1553, and when Ferdinand I refused to pay his ransom, he switched sides, supporting John II Sigismund Zápolya in his quest for power in Eastern Hungary Kingdom. Báthory took on various roles as a feudal lord, military commander, and diplomat during this time. At one point, he was put under house arrest in Vienna for two years, causing him to fall out of favor at Zápolya's court. However, he still held influence and was considered a potential successor to Zápolya.

After Zápolya died in 1571, Báthory became the Voivode of Transylvania through an election by the Transylvanian peoples. He had to deal with opposition from Gáspár Bekes, who had support from the Habsburgs. In 1573, Báthory successfully defeated Bekes in a civil war and forced him out of Transylvania. He then worked to navigate a balance between the Ottomans and the Holy Roman Empire to make Transylvania stronger.

Swimming

Swimming is the movement of the body through water using arms and legs. People can swim in the sea, swimming pools, rivers and lakes. People swim for exercise, for fun, and as a sport. There are several styles of swimming, known as "strokes", including: "front crawl", "breaststroke", "freestyle", "butterfly", and "backstroke".

Swimming works all the muscles simultaneously. It is impact free. It also builds up stamina. 

There are several styles in swimming. Some of them are:


The goal of competitive swimming is to improve speed, and to beat other competitors in events. An athlete goes through several stages of training. At the beginning, the body is overloaded with work. The workload becomes less closer to the date of the competition. This final stage is often referred to as "shave and taper"; the swimmer tapering downs his or her workload to be able to perform at their optimal level. At the end of this stage, before competition, the swimmer shaves off all exposed hair and dead skin. Often confused within shaving, swimmers shave to rid the skin of dead skin cells to expose sensitive skin to the water. The effect of shaving is a decrease in drag from hair and an increase in the sensation of "feeling" the water.

Sometimes equipment is used when swimming, and can include:

Biological control

Biological control, or biological pest control, is the reduction of pest populations by using natural enemies. It is important because crop pests become resistant to chemical pesticides.

Natural enemies of insect pests include predators, parasitoids, and pathogens. Biological control agents of weeds include herbivores and plant pathogens. Predators, such as birds, lady beetles and lacewings, are free-living species that eat many prey during their lifetime. 

Parasitoids are species whose larvae develop on or in a single insect host, ultimately killing or fatally infecting the host. Most have a very narrow host range. Many species of wasps and some flies are parasitoids. 

Pathogens are disease-causing organisms including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They kill or debilitate their host and are relatively specific.

There are three basic types of biological control strategies; conservation, classical biological control, and augmentation.




A Chinese text from 304 AD, "Records of the plants and trees of the southern regions", by Hsi Han, describes mandarin oranges protected by large reddish-yellow citrus ants. The ants attack and kill insect pests of the orange trees. The citrus ant ("Oecophylla smaragdina") was rediscovered in the 20th century, and now is again used in China to protect orange groves.

Sosigenes of Alexandria

Sosigenes of Alexandria was an astronomer in the 1st century BC. Julius Caesar consulted him, and other astrologers, before introducing the Julian calendar. Sosigenes also influenced Caesar's writing "De astris", but only parts of it remain. Pliny the Elder wrote In his Natural History that Sosigenes observed that the planet Mercury never had an elongation angle greater than 22 degrees from the sun.

Auld Alliance

The Auld Alliance (Scots) () is
an alliance between the kingdoms of Scotland and France. It played a major role in the relations between Scotland, France and England from its beginning in 1295 until the 1560 Treaty of Edinburgh. The alliance was renewed by all the French and Scottish monarchs of that period except for Louis XI. By the late 14th century, the treaty was renewed even when France or Scotland was not at war with England.

The alliance dates from the treaty signed by John Balliol and Philip IV of France in 1295 against Edward I of England. The treaty said that if either country was attacked by England, the other country would invade England. That happened at the Battle of Flodden Field, 1513. The alliance played an important role in conflicts between both countries and England, such as the Wars of Scottish Independence, the Hundred Years' War, the War of the League of Cambrai and the Rough Wooing.

In a speech which he delivered in Edinburgh in June 1942, Charles de Gaulle described the alliance between Scotland and France as "the oldest alliance in the world":
"In every combat where for five centuries the destiny of France was at stake, there were always men of Scotland to fight side by side with men of France, and what Frenchmen feel is that no people have ever been more generous than yours with its friendship."
In 1995, celebrations were held in both countries for the 700th anniversary of the beginning of the alliance.

However, in 2018 the largest "Aepyornis" specis, weighing up to , was moved to the related genus "Vorombe".

Sosigenes the Peripatetic

Sosigenes the Peripatetic was a philosopher who lived in the 2nd century AD. He followed the Aristotelian school of thought, and was one of the first people to write interpretations and commentaries to Aristotle's work.

He was the tutor of Alexander of Aphrodisias, and wrote a work "On Revolving Spheres". On 4th September 164 AD, he watched an 'annular' solar eclipse. He noticed that, unlike a total solar eclipse, the apparent size of the moon was smaller than that of the sun. This meant the distances between the sun, moon and earth were not the same at different eclipses. For this reason, sun and moon could not be on a circular movement around the same centre.

This was a significant discovery. It pinpointed a difficulty with the theory that the earth was the centre of the known universe. Much later, Nicolaus Copernicus used the same idea when he proposed a heliocentric view. In this view, the earth, moon and the planets rotate around the sun, which does not move.

Lara Flynn Boyle

Pope Sixtus V

Pope Sixtus V (; 13 December 1520 – 27 August 1590), born Felice Peretti di Montalto, was an Italian priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 228th Pope from 1585 to 1590.

Felice Peretti was born in December 15250 at Grottammare in the province of Ascoli Piceno.

In 1547, Peretti was ordained.

Peretti became a Franciscan; and in 1560, he became Apostolic vicar of his order.

In 1565, Pope Pius IV assigned Peretti to work with Cardinal Buoncompagni (who would become Pope Gregory XIII); but they did not work well together.

In 1566 Pope Pius V made Peretti Bishop of Sant' Agata dei Goti in the Kingdom of Naples.

In 1570, Peretti was raised to the rank of cardinal.

After the election of Gregory XIII, Peretti withdrew from public activities.

Cardinal di Montalto was elected pope in 1585; and he chose the name Sixtus V.

During the reign of Sixtus V, the dome of St Peter's Basilica was completed;. The external dome was covered with lead and the bands were covered with bronze gilt.

A building for the Vatican Library was constructed.

The investment in public works included the loggia of Sixtus in the Basilica of St. John Lateran; the chapel of the Praesepe in Santa Maria Maggiore; additions and repairs to the Quirinal Palace, Lateran Palace and Vatican Palace; the erection of four obelisks (including the one in the Piazza of St Peter's; the opening of six streets; and the restoration of the aqueduct of Severus ("Acqua Felice").



Lacewing

Lacewings, or 'Green lacewings', are insects in the large family Chrysopidae of the order Neuroptera. There are about 85 genera and (differing between sources) 1,300–2,000 species in this widespread group. However, in America and Europe, the two genera "Chrysopa" and "Chrysoperla" are very common.

Most species of lacewings and their larvae are active predators, and are often used for biological control. 

Many adults of "Chrysopa" can defend themselves by giving out a vile smell from glands at the front of their thorax.

They have 'ears' at the base of their front wings. When they hear bat echolocation sounds, they close their wings and drop down. They can escape spider webs, because, being so light, they do not create much vibration to alert the spider. Instead of struggling like most insects, the lacewing bites through the strands holding its legs and antennae. When it is stuck only by its wings, it become completely immobile. Slowly, the lacewing slides downwards out of the web. Tiny hairs on the wings prevent the sticky spider silk from touching the wings' surface. 

The larvae are voracious, attacking other insects of suitable size, especially soft-bodied ones (aphids, caterpillars and other insect larvae, insect eggs). When they touch a potential prey object, the larva grasps it. Their maxillae are hollow, and inject a digestive secretion into the prey. The organs of an aphid can be dissolved by this in 90 seconds.

Pre-frontal cortex

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the front part of the frontal lobes of the brain. It lies in front of the motor and premotor areas.

This brain region helps plan complex cognitive behaviours, personality expression, and decision making. It helps correct social behaviour. The basic activity of this brain region is to bring together thoughts and actions to help achieve internal goals.

The most typical psychological term for functions carried out by the prefrontal cortex area is executive function. This is the ability to work out conflicting thoughts. It determines good and bad, better and best, same and different, consequences of current activities, working toward a goal, prediction of outcomes, and expectation of results. Critical is 'social control': the ability to suppress urges which, if not suppressed, could lead to socially unacceptable outcomes.

Many authors have indicated an integral link between a person's personality and the functions of the prefrontal cortex.

Pest (biology)

A pest is an animal which harms humans or human concerns. It is a loosely defined term; it overlaps with the terms vermin, weeds, parasites and pathogens. In its broadest sense, a pest is a competitor of humanity.

According to BBC News Science & Environment, these are among the top ten pests of plants: Fungi are prominent in their list, and it is more usual to call them pathogens.


António Egas Moniz

The TOEIC Speaking Test takes about 20 minutes. The TOEIC Writing Test lasts about 60 minutes. Each test has a score between 0-200.

Nearly 1.5 million people take the TOEIC each year in Japan. The offers the test in Japan. There are two ways to take the TOEIC test. One is the TOEIC Secure Program (SP), the other is the TOEIC Institutional Testing Program (ITP). The SP is offered at a set place and time, and test takers go there for the exam. In the ITP, a group such as a university gives the test when and where they like. Groups giving the ITP test must follow the test rules.

The Institute for International Business Communication had a scandal in 2009.

The IIBC’s 92 year-old Chairman Yaeji Watanabe made his girlfriend's son Chairman of the IIBC Board of Directors. Watanabe forced out half the board of directors. Also, Watanabe only worked about one day a week. Watanabe's salary was more than 25 million yen each year. Watanabe said he was Chairman in name only and had little to do with choosing the new chairman. Then, Watanabe suddenly quit the IIBC. The son of his girlfriend was in charge of the non-profit company. The IIBC paid Watanabe 25 million yen for his retirement.

The IIBC lowered the price of the TOEIC Secure Program Test from 6,615 yen to 5,985 yen from September 13, 2009. Ministry of Trade asked the IIBC to lower the price because the test was making too much money.

IIBC has a for-profit partner company called International Communications School (ICS). In July 2010, the Tokyo Tax Bureau announced that ICS lied about 100 million yen in income. ICS had to pay 30 million yen in taxes and fines.

South Korea is the second largest user of TOEIC by population. But, some major corporations have stopped using TOEIC scores for employment, or have required lower scores.
From 2011, Korean universities were no longer allowed to use TOEIC and TOEFL scores as part of the selecting students. Seoul National University has developed another English proficiency test, TEPS. It may replace TOEIC.

In France, some Grandes écoles require a TOEIC score of at least 785 for a diploma. Some people think this is wrong because it means a diploma from a state school depends on a private corporation. The "Commission des titres d'ingénieur" set the 785 score as similar to a B2+ level on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.
Student who cannot score 785 may have to show their English language ability in some other way. Some schools allow one more year after the end of studies to complete the diploma.

In Greece, TOEIC is accepted by ASEP as part of hiring new government workers.

TOEIC is used by some universities in Italy. All universities require that students pass an English examination before entering a degree courses or receiving diplomas. Students usually need a TOEIC score of 600 to earn a diploma. Many universities allow other tests such as the Cambridge certificate and TOEFL.

TOEIC Bridge is a simpler version of the TOEIC test. This test is for beginning and intermediate speakers. It has 100 multiple-choice questions. The test lasts about one hour.

Pope Celestine III (; 1106 – 8 January 1198), born Giacinto Bobone, was an Italian cleric of the Roman Catholic Church and the 176th Pope from 1191 until his death in 1198.

He was born into the noble Orsini family in Rome.

In 1145, he is raised to the rank of cardinal.

Cardinal Bobone was elected pope on March 30, 1191; and he chose to be called Celestine III.

Pope Celestine was involved in Italian and European political disputes. He crowned the Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI. He excommunicated Duke Leopold of Austria and King Alonso IX of Leon.

After becoming pope, he was ordained a priest on April 13, 1191.



Jacques Lacan

Jacques Lacan (Paris, 13 April 1901 – Paris, 9 September 1981) was a French psychoanalyst and psychiatrist. He added new ideas to psychoanalysis and philosophy. Some of these ideas are the mirror stage, the three orders of subjectivity (the Imaginary, the Symbolic, and the Real), the object little a and jouissance. He talked every year at seminars from 1953 to 1981. In the 1960s and 1970s, he influenced many French intellectuals. He also talked about going back to the ideas of Sigmund Freud. He called himself a Freudian (follower of Freud).

Primo Levi

Primo Levi (31 July 1919 – 11 April 1987) was an Italian Jewish chemist and writer. He was the author of two novels and many short stories, poems and essays. His best-known book is "If This Is a Man", a true story about his time as a prisoner in the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II.

Levi was an atheist and born in Turin.


Panic disorder

Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder involving panic attacks. In addition, big changes in behavior might happen in at least one month, and the person might keep worrying about having other attacks. Panic disorder is a serious condition that can happen at any age. It can be treated with psychotherapy and antidepressants.

Generalized anxiety disorder

Generalized anxiety disorder is an anxiety disorder which consists of excessive and irrational worry of everyday things. This worry tends to interfere with normal daily functioning: people who have GAD anticipate disasters and they're always concerned about health matters, money, death, their own futures or family trouble. Physical issues include though are not limited to trembling, numbness, muscle tension, sweating or hot flashes for at least six months. Between six and eight million American adults have GAD.

Italian Social Republic

The Italian Social Republic ( or RSI) was a provisional government sponsored by and allied with Nazi Germany. It was led by Benito Mussolini and his Republican Fascist Party. In name, it controlled northern Italy but, in fact, the land was under German military control. The country had another informal name, Salò Republic (), after where their headquarters was located. Before 25 November 1943, the official name of the country was widely called Republican State of Italy and Republican National State (). It was the second and last Fascist Italian state.

Tanggu Truce

The Tanggu , sometimes called the "Tangku Truce" (; ; ; ) was a ceasefire signed between China and Empire of Japan in Tanggu District, Tianjin on May 31, 1933, formally ending the Japanese invasion of Manchuria which had begun two years earlier.

After the Mukden Incident of September 18, 1931, the Japanese Kwantung Army invaded Manchuria, and by February 1932 had captured the entire region. The last emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Puyi, who was living in exile in Tianjin was invited by the Japanese to accept the throne of the new Empire of Manchukuo, which was controlled by the Japanese army. In January 1933, to guard Manchukuo’s southern borders, a joint Japanese and Manchukuo force invaded Rehe, and after conquering that province by March, drove the remaining Chinese armies in the northeast outside the Great Wall into Hebei Province.
The Western powers blamed Japan's actions but did little else. When the League of Nations demanded that Japan stop fighting, the Japan withdrew from the League on March 27, 1933.
As the Japanese army was under clear orders from Emperor Hirohito (who wanted a quick end to the fight with China) not to go into the Great Wall, the Japanese halted their attack in May 1933.

On May 22, 1933, Chinese and Japanese representatives met to talk the end of the fight. The Japanese demands were serious: a demilitarized zone covering one hundred kilometers south of the Great Wall, from Beijing to Tianjin was to be set up, with the Great Wall itself under Japanese control. No regular Kuomintang military units were to be allowed in the zone, although the Japanese were allowed to use scout aircraft or ground patrols to check that the agreement was maintained. Public order within the zone was to be maintained by a police unit Demilitarized Zone Peace Preservation Corps. Furthermore, they forced China to recognise Manchukuo as a legitimate government. 
Two secret clauses left out any of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies from this Peace Preservation Corps and provided for any problems that could not be fixed by the Peace Preservation Corps to be arranged by agreement between the Japanese and Chinese governments. Having lost every major battles and much territory, and with the Chinese government under Chiang Kai-shek more concerned with fighting the Chinese Communist Party than the Japanese, the Chinese government agreed to all demands. Furthermore, the new demilitarized zone was mostly within the remaining territory of the Manchurian warlord Zhang Xueliang.

The Tanggu Truce resulted in the "de facto" recognition of Manchukuo by the Kuomingtang government, and acceptance of the loss of Rehe. It brought a short end to the combat between China and Japan and for a brief period, relations between the two countries improved. On May 17, 1935, the Japanese legation in China was improved to the status of , and on June 10, 1935, the He-Umezu Agreement was concluded. The Tanggu Truce gave Chiang kai Shek time to merge his forces and to focus his efforts against the Chinese Communist Party, though at the cost of northern China. However, Chinese public opinion was opposing to truce so favorable to Japan and so shameful to China. Although the Truce set up a demilitarized buffer zone, Japanese territorial desires towards China remained, and the Truce proved to be only a short break until fightings broke out again with the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937.

Mukden Incident

The Mukden Incident, also known as the Manchurian Incident, was an event set up by Japanese soldiers as a reason for invading the northern part of China known as Manchuria in 1931.
On September 18, 1931, a small amount of dynamite was blown up by a Japanese soldier near Japan's South Manchuria Railway near Mukden. Although the explosion was so weak that the rail was still usable, the Japanese army, blaming the action on the Chinese people, fully invaded Manchuria, leading to its occupation. Japan set up its puppet state of Manchukuo six months later. Soon the world knew the event, leading Japan to diplomatic isolation and its withdrawal from the League of Nations.

So far as of 2011, Hoobastank has released 4 studio albums:



Sensory receptor

A sensory receptor, or sense organ, is the part which responds to a stimulus in the internal or external environment of an organism. It is the input to the sensory system. In response to stimuli the sensory receptor fires off a nerve fibre which goes to the central nervous system.

In order to detect changes in the environment organisms need receptors. Organisms have various receptors, ranging from simple light or touch sensitive cells to complex nervous systems. 

Receptors are generally specialised for the detection of a specific type of stimulus. 

Parietal lobe

The parietal lobe is a part of the brain positioned above the occipital lobe and behind the frontal lobe. 

The parietal lobe brings together information from different senses, particularly spatial sense and navigation. For example, it uses input about touch, balance and the visual system. This enables the parietal cortex to map seen objects in relation to the body (into 'body coordinate positions'). This makes it possible for a person to reach out and handle objects.

The name derives from the overlying parietal bone, which is named from the Latin "pariet-", = 'wall'.

Frontal lobe

The frontal lobe is an area in the brain of humans and other mammals, at the front of each cerebral hemisphere. It is in front of the parietal lobe and above and in front of the temporal lobes. 

The frontal lobes takes action based on sensory information (sight, sound, touch) from the three rear areas of the cerebrum. The action is moderated by the influence of the pre-frontal cortex. The system is a delicate balance between the need to satisfy urges from the most ancient parts of the brain, such as hunger, self-defence and sex, with the need to act in a way which is socially acceptable. 

The precentral gyrus, forming the back of the frontal lobe, contains the primary motor cortex. This controls voluntary movements of specific body parts.

For many years, many scientists thought that the frontal lobe was comparatively larger in humans than in other primates. They thought that this was an important feature of human evolution and was the main reason why human cognition is different from that of the other primates. 

However, this view has been challenged by later research. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to find the volume of the frontal cortex in humans, all living ape species and several monkey species. The human frontal cortex is "not" relatively larger than the cortex in the other great apes, but it is relatively larger than the frontal cortex in the lesser apes and the monkeys.

Temporal lobe

The temporal lobe is a region of the cerebral cortex that is under the Sylvian fissure on both cerebral hemispheres of the mammalian brain.

The temporal lobe is involved in auditory perception and is home to the primary auditory cortex. It is also important for the processing of semantics (meaning) in both speech and vision. The temporal lobe contains the hippocampus and plays a key role in the formation of long-term memory.

An area in the Sylvian fissure is the first place where auditory signals from the cochlea reach the cerebral cortex. This part of the cortex (primary auditory cortex) is involved in hearing. Other areas of the temporal lobes are involved in high-level auditory processing. In humans this includes speech, for which the left temporal lobe in particular seems to be specialized. Wernicke's area, which spans the region between temporal and parietal lobes, plays a key role (with Broca's area, which is in the frontal lobe). The functions of the left temporal lobe extends to comprehension, naming, verbal memory and other language functions. 

The underside of the temporal lobes do high-level visual processing of faces and scenes. Front parts of this area are involved in object perception and recognition.

Deep inside the medial temporal lobes lie the hippocampus, which is essential for memory function – particularly the transfer from short to long term memory and control of spatial memory and behaviour.

The Little Drummer Boy

"The Little Drummer Boy" is a very popular Christmas carol. It was recorded in 1955 by the Trapp Family Singers. It was made more popular three years later by the Harry Simeone Chorale. This song has been covered by others, including Johnny Mathis, Johnny Cash, Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney throughout the years.

Ex nihilo

Creatio ex nihilo is an idea found in certain faiths. It means that a creator god created the world, "from nothing", without any conditions. It is the opposite of creatio ex materia.

Cochlea

The cochlea is the auditory portion of the inner ear. It is a spiral-shaped cavity in the bony labyrinth, making 2.5 turns around its axis.
A core component of the cochlea is the Organ of Corti, the sensory organ of hearing, which is distributed along the partition separating fluid chambers in the coiled tapered tube of the cochlea.

The name is from the Greek κοχλίας "kokhlias" ("snail, screw"), from κόχλος "kokhlos" ("spiral shell"). This is in reference to its coiled shape: the cochlea is coiled in most mammals, monotremes being the exceptions.

Limit (roller coaster)

Limit is an inverted roller coaster at Heide-Park Soltau, Germany. It is a standard "Suspended Looping Coaster" built by Dutch roller coaster builder Vekoma and opened in 1999. Limit has 5 inversions, has a length of 689 meter, a maximum speed of 80 kilometers per hour. One round takes 1 minute and 36 seconds.

Limit has 2 trains with each 10 cars. 1 car can hold 2 riders, which gives a total of 20 riders per train. The maximum capacity is 1040 riders per hour.

Survivor Series (2011)

Survivor Series (2011) is the 12th pay-per-view (PPV) of 2011. It is also the 25th edition of Survivor Series. This PPV will take place on November 20, 2011 at the Madison Square Garden in New York City, it is the third time that the Madison Square Garden hosts this Pay-Per-View after the 1996 and 2002 edition of Survivor Series. So far, four matches have been announced by the WWE for the event.

Survivor Series will feature professional wrestling matches involving different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines that develop on WWE's television programs. Wrestlers portray villains or heroes as they follow a series of events that build tension and culminate into a wrestling match or series of matches.


Super Size Me

Super Size Me is a 2003 American documentary movie directed by and starring Morgan Spurlock. It is about an experiment where Spurlock ate nothing but food from McDonald's for thirty days. He ate at McDonald's three times a day, eating an average of 5,000 kcal per day. This experiment lasted from February 1 to March 2, 2003. This experiment was bad for his own physical and psychological health. 

During the experiment, Spurlock gained 24½ lbs., had a 13% body mass increase, his cholesterol level went to 230, and he had mood swings, sexual dysfunction, and had fat accumulation in his liver. After the experiment, he recovered with a vegan diet his then-future wife prepared for him (she is a gourmet vegetarian cook).

This experiment was conducted because of the obesity epidemic in the United States, and because of a case in which two teenage girls sued McDonald's who claimed they became obese as a result of eating food from McDonald's.

Spurlock also uses this movie to criticize McDonald's and the fast food industry, ranging from the sale of unhealthy food to corporate marketing and to the personal profit of these organizations.

Brussels Airport

Brussels Airport (IATA "BRU") is the national airport of Belgium. It is the biggest airport in Belgium. It has more than 17 billion travelers each year. It is 18 km from Brussels, the capital of Belgium.

The airport is used by a lot of airlines such as Brussels Airlines, Thomas Cook Airlines and Jetairfly.

On 22 March 2016, two bombs exploded at the airport. 

The airport has two terminals. (A terminal is a building where passengers wait to get on planes.) One terminal is used for flights to the Schengen Area. The second terminal is used for flights to countries out of the Schengen Area.

Ray Kroc

Raymond Albert Kroc (October 5, 1902 – January 14, 1984) was an American entrepreneur. He was best known for turning the McDonald's restaurant chain into a franchise company.

Kroc's life while franchising McDonald's was made into a movie called "The Founder" with Michael Keaton playing Kroc.

Non-Newtonian fluid

A non-Newtonian fluid is a thixotropic fluid which changes its viscosity when the forces on it change.

Other flow properties may also be affected. Most commonly viscosity of such fluids is not independent of the shear rate or the shear rate history. Examples of such fluids are blood, quicksand and certain components of cement. Many lubricants, ketchup, and oobleck. Also certain forms of dough and pudding also have this property.

The other kind of fluids that do not show this behavior is called Newtonian fluids.

It is very simple to make a non-Newtonian fluid at home. All one needs is water and cornstarch. Mix these two ingredients together at a rate of one part cornstarch and one and a half parts water. That makes a non-Newtonian fluid called oobleck.


Newtonian fluid

A Newtonian fluid is a fluid, where the ratio between shear stress changes linearly in proportion to the stress it is exposed to. This proportion is known as viscosity. Note that the inverse is not true; there are fluids with constant viscosity, that are Non-Newtonian fluids: one example is the Boger fluid.

Airblue

Airblue Limited (styled as airblue) is a private airline. Its head office is in Islamabad, Pakistan. It is Pakistan's second largest airline (after Pakistan International Airlines). It has over 20% of Pakistan's market.

Airblue operates scheduled flights operating 30 daily services, linking four domestic destinations and international services to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, Muscat and Manchester. It carried 1.4 million passengers on domestic flights in the 2006–2007 season. Its main hub is Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, Pakistan.

The airline started its operations on June 2004. It had 3 leased Airbus A320-200 airplanes serving three daily domestic flights. In 2007, the company started flights to Manchester via a fuel stop at Trabzon in Turkey. This route is the longest route operated by an A320 family airplanes in the world. It is also the longest scheduled route operated by an Airbus narrow-body airplanes.


Schengen Area

The Schengen Area is an area that includes 27 European countries. All of those countries have signed the Schengen Agreement in Schengen, Luxembourg in 1985. 

The Schengen area removes passport control between its member countries. This means travelers who go from one Schengen country to another do not clear immigration checks anymore. Passengers go through immigration checks if they enter or exit the Schengen Area. 

The current members of the Schengen Area are Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Because Switzerland is not part of the European Economic Area, customs control in Switzerland still exists. 

At this moment, 400 million people live in the area. The territory covers 4,312,099 square kilometres.

On 14 June 1985 the Schengen Agreement was signed. This happened on the boat "Princess Marie-Astrid" in the middle of the river Moselle. On that place, the borders of France, Germany and Luxembourg meet. Five countries signed the Agreement: Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands and West Germany. It was signed, but that didn't mean it was already implemented.

In 26 March 1995, all European Union members (except the United Kingdom and Ireland) signed the Agreement. Norway and Iceland also signed the Agreement. 

On 1 May 2004, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia joined the EU. They signed the Schengen agreement on that same day. They implemented the Schengen Agreement on 21 December 2007.

Switzerland joined the Schengen Area on 12 December 2008. Liechtenstein joined it on 19 December 2011. Croatia joined it on 1 January 2023.

Twenty-seven countries belong to the Schengen Area. All these countries are members of the European Union, except Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.

Some nationalities need visas to visit the Schengen Area. They only need one Schengen visa for all countries. But they must apply at the embassy of their main destination. The main destination is where a traveller wants to spend the longest time. The visa officer can issue a visa for only one trip or many trips. The officer also decides how long the visa is valid for. The traveller needs to exit before the Schengen visa expires. 

Travellers who do not need a Schengen visa can stay for up to 90 days in a 180-day period. 

Superstition

A superstition is a belief that has no logical explanation or scientific evidence. There are many superstitions believed in around the world. Many people believe superstitions to be complete nonsense while others live their lives according to superstitions such as avoiding black cats, looking for four leaf clovers and avoiding mirrors.


MC Ren

Lorenzo Jerald Patterson (born June 16, 1969) is an American rapper. He is best known by his stage name MC Ren. MC Ren was a member of the gangsta rap group N.W.A.

Like all N.W.A members (except Ice Cube) he was born and raised in Compton, California. 

He joined N.W.A after completing his senior year of high school. He was with N.W.A on all their studio and EP releases. Problems over money caused N.W.A to end. MC Ren and all the other members of N.W.A went solo. 

Using Eazy E's record label, Ruthless Records, Ren released his first album "Shock of Tha Hour" in 1993.



Captain &amp; Tennille

Captain and Tennille were an United States pop music group. The group was a husband and wife duo. The members were Daryl "Captain" Dragon and Toni Tennille. They are based out of California. The duo is best known for the song "Love will Keep Us Together". They have many other notable hit records.


Hurricane Ernesto

Hurricane Ernesto was a very damaging hurricane during the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm moved across Haiti and Dominican Republic as a minor hurricane. Then, the storm moved over Florida while a tropical storm. It later struck North Carolina, when the storm was almost a hurricane. It killed eleven people. The total damage from Ernesto was $500 million (2006 USD).

Undergraduate education

Undergraduate education is a level of education wherein a student completes their first degree. The first degree of an undergraduate degree is normally named a bachelor's degree. Therefore, for many subjects in many systems of education, undergraduate education is between secondary education and a bachelor's degree. This education usually takes place in a university. In the United States, a person starting at a university is known as undergraduate while students who have higher degrees are known as graduate students. In some other educational systems and subjects, undergraduate education is between secondary education and a master's degree, for example in some science and engineering courses in Britain and some medicine courses in Europe.

In Brazil, it normally takes four or five years to complete an "undergraduate" degree. Students need to choose their main subjects before they join the university by taking a test named a "vestibular".

Undergraduate degrees are not like in the United States where students have general studies during the first years and only specialize in a "major" during the last years of college. European students enroll in a specific course of studies they want to do from the start. They are expected to have received a good general education already in the secondary level in a school (like a gymnasium or lycée). In many countries they go to university at 18 or 17. The degree normally takes four or five years. After completing the first degree students can move on to doctoral studies. In many countries, the English distinction between a bachelor's and master's degree is only now being introduced by the Bologna process. This means that the old first degree would be approximately equal to a master's degree in the US or the UK.

In the United Kingdom, undergraduate normally means students studying to get a Bachelor's degree. It is also called an award. Getting a bachelor's degree normally takes three years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, it takes four years to obtain a Bachelor's degree "with honours", and five years to obtain a Scottish master's degree. Alternatively, what is known as an "ordinary degree" can be obtained in three years. Some undergraduates in England do a master's degree as their first degree in a similar manner to Scotland. The first three years are spent attaining a bachelor's degree and the last year includes research and more difficult subjects. In England, this is more common for degrees in science and engineering.

The only universities where it is possible to receive a master's degree without even attending the university beyond the award of the bachelor's degree are Oxford and Cambridge. Master's are generally awarded to Oxford and Cambridge graduates a year after they have graduated with bachelor's degrees.

In Ireland, undergraduate study is like in the United Kingdom. It is like this because undergraduate education was first taught the same in both countries. In Ireland, the undergraduate degree is closest to the Scottish type in the United Kingdom. They are four year undergraduate programmes.

In India, it takes 3 years to complete the undergraduate course (other than engineering, law and medicine). There are two types of undergraduate courses. Arts and Science is the first one which takes 3 years to complete the courses. Another one is Engineering, this will take 4 years to complete the courses (B.E/B.TECH).

In the United States most undergraduate education is done at colleges or universities. Undergraduate education gives a bachelor's degree. This usually takes four years of study, although some courses take five years.

In the United States students in different years are often given different names:

Some students choose to attend a community college or junior college for two years beforehand to further study at another college or university.

Most universities also offer graduate study. Some institutions (e.g. liberal-arts colleges) only give undergraduate education or only give a small number another level of education. Getting an undergraduate degrees normally needs many courses to be completed. The courses have different subjects and different levels of difficulty. The academic discipline of the most number of subjects taken is called a "major" or concentration.

Unlike in the British model, degrees in law and medicine are not offered at the undergraduate level and are completed as graduate study after earning a bachelor's degree. Neither field specifies or prefers any undergraduate major, though medicine has set prerequisite courses that must be taken before enrollment. However, nursing is taught as an undergraduate program.

Burl Ives

Burl Icle Ivanhoe Ives (June 14, 1909 - April 14, 1995) was an American actor and folk singer. He was born in Hunt City, Illinois. He acted on stage and in many movies. He was a folk music singer. He died from mouth cancer in Anacortes, Washington.


UPC Tirol Liga

The UPC Tirol Liga (also called Tiroler Landesliga or Tiroler Liga) is the highest class in Tyrolian football; it is the 4th division in Austrian man football league system. The champion is qualified for the Regionalliga West, the last to teams are relegated in the Landesliga West or Ost. The league is named after the main sponsor, an Austrian telecommunication provider.

Thixotropy

Thixotropy is the property of certain gels or fluids that are viscous (thick) under normal conditions, but flow (become thin, less viscous) when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.

In more technical language:
some Non-Newtonian fluids show a change in viscosity; the longer the fluid undergoes shear stress, the lower its viscosity. A thixotropic fluid is a fluid which takes a finite time to attain equilibrium viscosity when introduced to a step change in shear rate. Many gels and colloids are thixotropic materials, exhibiting a stable form at rest but becoming fluid when agitated. 

Some fluids are anti-thixotropic: constant shear stress for a time causes an increase in viscosity or even solidification. Constant shear stress can be applied by shaking or mixing. They are much less common.

It is a common experience walking on sand that in places it liquifies as one walks on it. This is a thixotropic response to pressure. In extremes, a quicksand may be danger to people and animals.

Some clays are thixotropic, and their behaviour is of great importance in structural and geotechnical engineering. Landslides, such as those common in the cliffs around Lyme Regis, Dorset and in the Aberfan disaster in Wales are evidence of this. Similarly, a lahar is a mass of earth liquefied by a volcanic event, which rapidly solidifies once coming to rest. 

Drilling muds used in geotechnical applications can be thixotropic. Honey from honey bees may also exhibit this property under certain conditions.(Heather honey). 

Another example of a thixotropic fluid is the synovial fluid found in joints between some bones.

Some clay deposits found in the process of exploring caves exhibit thixotropism: an initially solid-seeming mudbank will turn soupy and yield up moisture when dug into or otherwise disturbed. These clays were deposited in the past by low-velocity streams which tend to deposit fine-grained sediment.

These properties are often used in commercial products which are applied to surfaces, such as paint or toothpaste. With paint, the fluidity vanishes quickly and the surface sets permanently as water (or oil) evaporates.

Super Mario 3D Land

Super Mario 3D Land is a 2011 game made by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS. It was released on November 3, 2011 in Japan, November 13, 2011 in America, November 18 in Europe, and November 24 in Australia. In it, you can become Tanooki Mario, Boomerang Mario and you can also get the old power-ups (Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, Super Star). A sequel, titled "Super Mario 3D World", was released for the Wii U in November 2013.

The game got praise from many critics. It was rated 9.5 out of 10 by IGN, and 94% by Official Nintendo Magazine, but GameSpot gave the game a lower score of 8/10. Overall, the game received a 90/100 on Metacritic.


Coke (fuel)

Coke is a fuel used mainly in blast furnaces to reduce iron oxide to produce iron. It contains carbon, and is similar to coal. It is made from coal by cooking out things that are not carbon. Coke is a product of destructive distillation of coal. This is done in an airless furnace or oven (kiln) at temperatures as high as but usually around . This baking drives off volatile parts of the coal, such as water, gas, and tar.

Coke is an almost pure form of carbon. The calorific value (heat energy produced when a fuel is burnt) of coke is about 56,000 kilojoules/kilogram.
Coke is used as a fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace. The carbon monoxide produced by its combustion reduces iron oxide (hematite) to the iron product.

Although coke is more expensive than coal, it can be used in households as a clean fuel, relatively free of smoke and impurities. At the present day its use in domestic heating has been less than oil or gas, but in the 20th century it was often used in kitchen stoves.

Pope Urban V

Pope Urban V (; 1310 – December 19, 1370), born Guillaume Grimoard, was a French cleric of the Roman Catholic Church and the 201st Pope from 1362 until his death in 1370.

He was the sixth of the seven popes who lived in Avignon in France.

Grimoard was born in Grizac in the Languedoc region of France. 

He became a Benedictine monk; and he was ordained at Chirac. 

Grimoard became the abbot of Saint-Victor in Marseille.

He was not a cardinal. There were several Popes who were not Cardinals. Some of these were Pope Urban IV and Pope Urban VI.

Grimoard was elected pope on September 28, 1362; and he chose to be called Pope Urban. 

Pope Urban was involved in Italian and European political disputes.

In 1367, the pope traveled from Avignon to Rome. He returned to Avignon in where he died in 1370.

In 1870, Urban V was beatified by Pope Pius IX.



Squad automatic weapon

A Squad automatic weapon (SAW, also known as section automatic weapon or light support weapon) is a weapon used to give infantry squads or sections automatic firepower that can easily be moved around. Weapons used for this are selective fire rifles. They usually have a bipod and a heavier barrel so that they can be used as light machine guns. SAWs usually fire the same cartridge as the assault rifles or battle rifles used by other people in the squad/section. This makes logistics easier because only one type of ammunition needs to be given to a unit. SAWs are light enough to be used by one man. However, heavy machine guns such as the Browning M2 are more powerful but need a crew to be as effective as they can be.

Many SAWs (such as the RPK and L86) are just assault rifles or battle rifles that have been changed. They may be able to carry more ammunition and will almost always have a bipod. In the case of some assault rifles, such as the H&K G36 or Steyr AUG, the SAW is simply the usual rifle with a few parts changed. However, the Austrian Army, who uses the most Steyr AUGs, doesn't use the HBAR (heavy barrel) version of the assault rifle. Instead, they use the MG 74, which is a gun which was made from the design of the German WW2-machine gun MG 42. One of the first weapons designed for this role was the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle. Even though it could not carry many bullets in its magazine, it was still better than the usual infantry rifle.




Sign (mathematics)

In mathematics, the word sign refers to the property of being positive or negative. Every real number that is non-zero is either positive or negative, and therefore has a sign. Zero itself is without a sign, or signless. In addition to putting signs into real numbers, the word sign is used throughout mathematics to indicate parts of mathematical objects that mean positivity and negativity. Usually, if numbers are seen without a sign, they are seen as a positive number. Otherwise, a minus sign "formula_1" is appended before the number to indicate that the number is a negative of another number.

The word sign is also sometimes used to refer to various mathematical signs, such as the plus and minus signs and the multiplication sign.

A real number is said to be positive if it is greater than zero, and negative if it is less than zero. The attribute of being positive or negative is called the sign of the number. Zero itself is not considered to have a sign.

In arithmetic, the sign of a number is often denoted by placing a plus or minus sign before the number. For example, +3 would denote a positive 3, and −3 would denote a negative 3. When no plus or minus sign is given, the main way of seeing it is that a number is positive. In algebra equations, a positive number may need to have a positive sign before it. For example, in algebraic subtraction, you would write (+8) + (-6).

The sign of any number that is not zero can be changed to positive using the absolute value function. For example, the absolute value of −3 and the absolute value of 3 are both equal to 3. In symbols, this would be written as |−3| = 3 and |3| = 3.

The number zero is neither positive nor negative, and therefore has no sign. In arithmetic, +0 and −0 both mean the same number 0.

Because zero is neither positive nor negative, the following are sometimes used to refer to the sign of an unknown number:
Thus a non-negative number is either positive or zero, while a non-positive number is either negative or zero. For example, the absolute value of a real number is always non-negative, but is not necessarily positive.

The same definition is sometimes used for functions that take real or integer values. For example, a function would be called positive if all of its values are positive, or non-negative if all of its values are non-negative.

In many texts, it is common to see a sign together with the measure of an angle, particularly a located angle or an angle of rotation. In such a situation, the sign says whether the angle is in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Though different conventions can be used, it is common in mathematics to have counterclockwise angles count as positive, and clockwise angles count as negative.

It is also possible to put a sign to an angle of rotation in three dimensions, assuming the axis of rotation has been oriented. Specifically, a right-handed turn around an axis usually counts as positive, while a left-handed rotation counts as negative.

In arithmetic and physics, it is common to label certain directions as positive or negative. For a basic example, the number line is usually drawn with positive numbers to the right, and negative numbers to the left:
On the Cartesian plane, the rightward and upward directions are usually thought of as positive, with rightward being the positive "x"-direction, and upward being the positive "y"-direction.

In addition to the sign of a real number, the word sign is also used in various related ways throughout mathematics and other sciences:


Coordinate system

A coordinate system is a system of numbers used to uniquely determine the position of a point. For two-dimensional systems, the numbers (scalars) are in ordered pairs. More dimensions call for more numbers. 

For example, (3) is one-dimensional, (1, 4) is two-dimensional, (1, 5, 9) is three-dimensional, (2, 6, 5, 3) is four-dimensional, and (5, 8, 9, 7, 9) is five-dimensional.

Impetigo

Impetigo is a very contagious bacterial skin infection. It is most common in pre-school children. People who play close-contact sports like rugby and American football are also at risk. Impetigo is not very common in adults. Impetigo can also be called "school sores".

Protopunk

Protopunk is a term used to describe the precursors of punk rock. Many of the artists whose sound helped pave the way for punk came from the 1960s and early 1970s. Some have been cited by early punk musicians as influential. These artists came from many different musical backgrounds.

Below is a list of notable bands who influenced early punk rock.

Locative case

The locative (abbreviated ) is a grammatical case. It indicates the location (place, place where) of something. It corresponds roughly to the English prepositions ""in", "on", "at" and "by". The locative case belongs to the general local cases together with the lative and separative case.

Exxon Valdez oil spill

The "Exxon Valdez" oil spill was a shipping accident that happened off the coast of the United States on March 24, 1989. An oil tanker, the "Exxon Valdez", hit a reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska. At the time of the disaster, the ship carried 53,094,510 U.S. gallons (44,210,430 imp gal/200,984,600 L) of crude oil. The accident caused a massive oil spill: 10.8 million U.S. gallons (9.0 million imp gal/41 million L) were spilled into the Prince William Sound. It was one of the worst man-made environmental disasters in the history of the United States.

The ship had left the shipping lanes because of icebergs. The ship never returned to the shipping lane and hit Bligh Reef at around 12:04 AM. Later, people looked at the causes, and found that the people on board were badly trained and overworked. What made things worse was the fact that the government was not prepared to handle a disaster with such large consequences for the environment. This disaster badly damaged the ecosystems of the area. An estimated 21,300 fish died after being poisoned by the crude oil. The birds that ate the fish got sick.

Some of the methods tried to clean up the oil were: burning, mechanical cleaning, and chemical dispersants.

Pope Urban VI

Pope Urban VI (; c. 1318 – October 15, 1389), born Bartolomeo Prignano, was an Italian priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 203rd Pope from 1378 to 1389.

Prignano was born in Naples. 

In 1364, Prignano was made the Archbishop of Acerenza by Pope Urban V.

Pope Gregory XI made Prignano Archbishop of Bari in 1377.

He was not a cardinal. There were several Popes who were not Cardinals. One of these was Pope Urban V.

Prignano was elected pope on April 8, 1378; and he chose to be called Pope Urban VI. 

A period called the "Western Schism" began on 20 September 20, 1378 when Robert of Geneva (also known as Clement VII) was chosen pope by 13 French cardinals. Clement VII is now considered to have been an antipope. 

A large part of Germany, Flanders, Italy (with exception of Naples), England and Ireland recognized Urban VI as the pope; but many in Western Europe supported the papacy of Clement VII.


Webster (TV series)

Webster was an American television sitcom which began in September 1983 and aired until March 1989 (the show aired to 1987 on ABC, and in syndication for the rest of its run). It was about an orphaned African American boy by the name of Webster who had lost his parents and was then adopted by a white family. The show "Webster" was set in Chicago.

Rocca Petru

Rocca Petru (28 September 1887 – 7 June 1966) was a poet and writer from Corsica, who wanted his island free from France. At first, he supported the Corsica becoming a part of Italy, but then promoted the autonomy of Corsica after World War II.

Rocca, called Petru in Corsican, was a gifted writer since young age. He contributed in Corsica to the magazine "A Tramuntana". During World War I, he wrote about the war and was decorated with the French Legion of Honor.

From May 1920, Rocca worked with the literary magazine "A Muvra". During the first half of the 20th century, this was the most important Corsican publication in Italian. In 1922 he created the "Partitu Corsu d'Azione", following the model of the Italian Partito Sardo d'Azione of Sardinia that had autonomism ideals.

After that, in the late 1920s, he created the "Partito autonomista di Corsica" with the support of Domenico Parlotti and Dr. Croce, director of the Archivi di Stato della Corsica.

During the late 1930s Rocca, slowly changed his political opinions from wanting autonomy for Corsica to supporting the union of Corsica with Italy. He supported the ideals of Petru Giovacchini, an irredentist leader who created the main pro-Italian political organization in Corsica: the "Gruppi d’Azione Irredentista Corsa".

In 1938, the French government punished him for his approach to the Italian Risorgimento ideals. They took away his French Legion of Honor medal. "A Muvra" started in 1939 to write articles against the Jews (responsible in Rocca's opinion for the French "occupation" of Corsica) and was quickly closed.

During World War II, Rocca supported Benito Mussolini's ideals about the union of Corsica to the Kingdom of Italy. When Italian troops occupied the island in 1942, Rocca was proposed to be "Governor" of a Corsica united to Italy. After the Italian defeat in September 1943, he was harassed by the French authorities.

As a consequence of this in 1946 he was sentenced to 15 years of jail and sent to French Guiana. When released, he quickly recreated his original "Partito autonomista di Corsica".

In 1953, Rocca created an academy for the defense of the Corsican language. He demanded from France the recognition of the Corsican people and language and the creation of the University of Corte. Rocca was, until his death in 1966, a strong supporter of Corsican nationalism.



Pope Urban VII

Pope Urban VII (; 4 August 1521 – 27 September 1590), born Giovanni Battista Castagna, was an Italian priest of the Roman Catholic Church and the 229th Pope. He ruled for thirteen days in September 1590, and died before his consecration, from malaria. This makes him the shortest reigning Pope in the history of the Catholic Church.

Castagna was of Genoese origin, although born in Rome.

Castagna was ordained priest 30 March 30, 1553. 

Pope Julius III appointed him Archbishop of Rossano on March 1, 1553. 

In 1584, Pope Gregory XIII made Castagna Cardinal of S. Marcello. 

Cardinal Castagna was elected pope on 15 September 1590. He chose the name Urban, which in Latin signifies "kind". 

Pope Urban died from Malaria on September 27, 1590.

In the Realm of the Senses

In the Realm of the Senses is a romantic movie which was released during 1976 in certain countries, 1977 in others. The movie is a fictional tale of sexually explicit adult behavior in 1930s Japan. This motion picture caused extremely huge controversy when it was released. Certain countries wouldn't even show the movie. Moreover, it was not available for home video until around 1990. It was originally rated X, though the rating was later converted into NC-17 in 1991.


Colloid

A colloid is a mixture of one substance spread out evenly inside another substance. They can be in two different phases or states of matter. 

One substance is the dispersion medium, such as water or gas. The other is the dispersed medium, sometimes called the 'internal phase'. This is usually tiny solid particles. Otherwise, if the dispersion medium is a gas, then the internal phase can be either tiny particles or tiny droplets of a liquid.

Definition: A colloid is a substance microscopically dispersed evenly throughout another substance. The dispersed-phase particles have a diameter between about 5 and 200 nanometers.

Examples:

Lyme Regis

Lyme Regis is a coastal town in West Dorset, England, 25 miles west of Dorchester and east of Exeter. The town lies in Lyme Bay, on the English Channel coast at the Dorset-Devon border. It is nicknamed 'The Pearl of Dorset'.

The town is noted for the fossils found in the cliffs and beaches, which are part of the Jurassic Coast–a World Heritage Site. The harbour wall, "The Cobb", features in Jane Austen's novel "Persuasion", and in the movie and novel, "The French Lieutenant's Woman", by local writer John Fowles.

When people were counted in the town's most recent census in 2001, the population was 4,406. 45% of the town's population were retired people.

The town is noted for the fossils found in the cliffs and beaches, which are part of the Jurassic Coast–a World Heritage Site. The Jurassic Coast stretches over a distance of .

The coastal exposures along the coastline provide a continuous sequence of Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous rock formations spanning approximately 185 million years of the Earth's history. The localities along the Jurassic Coast include some important fossil zones.
The Blue Lias rock is host to a multitude of remains from the early Jurassic, a time from which good fossil records are rare. Many of the remains are well preserved, with complete specimens of several important species. Many of the earliest discoveries of dinosaur and other prehistoric reptile remains were made in the area surrounding Lyme Regis, notably those discovered by Mary Anning (1799–1847). Significant finds include "Ichthyosaur", "Plesiosaur", "Dimorphodon", "Scelidosaurus", one of the first armoured (Thyreophora) dinosaurs. The town now holds an annual Mary Anning Day and Lyme Regis Fossil Festival. A fossil of the world's largest moth was discovered in 1966 at Lyme Regis.

The coastal region near Lyme Regis is subject to large landslips. This means that Jurassic age fossils are regularly exposed and can be found on the beaches, but also causes devastation to the town.

One of the most spectacular landslips occurred on 24 December 1839, west along the coast in Devon belonging to Bindon Manor and known as "The Dowlands Landslip". About of fields growing wheat and turnips were dislodged when a great chasm was formed more than across, deep and long. The crops remained intact on the top of what became known as "Goat Island" among the newly formed gullies. On 3 February 1840, five weeks later, there was a second landslip nearby but much smaller than the former. This strange phenomenon attracted many visitors, and the canny farmers charged sixpence for entrance and held a grand reaping party when the wheat ripened. The area is now known as The Undercliff and is of great interest because of its diverse natural history.

In 2005, work began on a £16 million engineering project to stabilise the cliffs and protect the town from coastal erosion. The town's main beach was reconstructed and re-opened on 1 July 2006.
On the evening of 6 May 2008, a section of land slipped onto the beach between Lyme Regis and Charmouth. Local Police described the landslip as the "worst for 100 years".

Non-renewable resource

A non-renewable resource is a natural resource that is used up faster than it can be made by nature. It cannot be produced, grown or generated on a scale which can sustain how quickly it is being consumed. Once it is used up, there is no more available for the future. Fossil fuels (such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas), types of nuclear power (uranium) and certain examples. Resources such as timber (when harvested sustainably) or metals (which can be recycled) are considered renewable resources. Non-renewable resources are also called exhaustible resources.

The renewable energy is the contrary notion.

Personal name

A personal name is the label which identifies an individual person. It is a proper name; and it is usually made up of a given name plus a surname. 

The Convention on the Rights of the Child specifies that a child has the right from birth to a name.

Regnal name

A regnal name, or reign name, is a formal name or label which refers to the years of the reign of a monarch or a pope. 

A monarch sometimes chooses a reign name which is different from his or her personal name.

A pope chooses a regnal name when he is elected. It becomes his new personal name.

The new name -- or sometimes the old one -- is followed by an ordinal number to create a unique name for the period in which the monarch is on the throne. 


Wolfsberger AC

Wolfsberger AC is a football club from the city of Wolfsberg, Carinthia, Austria. The club was founded in 1931. The colours are black and white. 

The club competed in twenty seasons on the second level of the Austrian football leagues. Between the 2007–08 and 2011–12 seasons, Wolfsberger AC united with SK St. Andrä to compete under the name WAC/St. Andrä. Both clubs stayed independent, but had a central administration and marketing. In 2010 they reached the Austrian football first league. In their first season they reached the 4th place. After 2011/12 season the club was promoted to Austrian Bundesliga for the first time in their history.

Wolfsberg finished third in the 2018–19 Austrian Football Bundesliga. They were qualified for the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League group stage. They finished in fourth place in Group J of the UEFA Europa League in the 2019–20 season. 

The second squad of WAC is playing in the Regionalliga Mitte (3th division).

Kimmeridge clay

The Kimmeridge clay formation is a sedimentary deposit of fossiliferous marine clay and mudstones. It is of Upper Jurassic age, and occurs in Europe. It gives its name to a stage in the Upper Jurassic called the Kimmeridgian, lasting from 157.3–152.1 million years ago.

Kimmeridge clay is perhaps the most economically important unit of rocks in the whole of Europe, because it is the major source for oil fields in the North Sea.

The clay is named after the village of Kimmeridge on the Dorset coast of England, where it is well exposed and forms part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. It exists across England, in a band stretching from Dorset in the south-west, north-east to East Anglia and Hull. The River Humber Bridge's foundations are in the Kimmeridge Clay deposits under the Humber estuary.

The fossil fauna of the Kimmeridge Clay includes a reptile fauna of turtles, crocodiles, dinosaurs, plesiosaurs, pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs, as well as many invertebrate species such as "Gryphaea".

The Kimmeridge Clay was laid down in 
an environment which is not present on the Earth today. Much of Western Europe was covered by a high sea-level: this may be related to the opening of the Atlantic. As a consequence, the UK was covered by a shallow and largely anoxic sea, perhaps less than 100m deep, with occasional landmasses.

This was shallower water than the Blue Lias of the Lower Jurassic. It was often low in oxygen, which led to its organic material being only partially decomposed. The mudstones are organic-rich, and gave rise to most of the North Sea oil.

Yamasee War

The Yamasee War was a war between the Yamasee Indians and the South Carolina settlers from 1715-1717.

Orbital forcing

Orbital forcing is the effect on climate of slow changes in the tilt of the Earth's axis and shape of the orbit (see Milankovitch cycles). 

These orbital changes alter the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth by up to 25% at mid-latitudes. That has a huge effect. The term "forcing" is a physical process which definitely affects the Earth's climate.

This mechanism is believed to be responsible for the timing of the ice age cycles. The timing of past glacial periods coincides very well with the predictions of the Milankovitch theory, and these effects can be calculated into the future.

Note in the graphic the strong 100,000 year periodicity of the cycles, and the striking asymmetry of the curves. Ice ages deepen by progressive steps, but the recovery to interglacial conditions occurs in one big step.

Milton Berle

Mendel Berlinger, better known as Milton Berle, (July 12, 1908 – March 27, 2002) was an American actor and comedian.

Sungai Petani

Sungai Petani (abbreviated ""Sg. Petani"" or ""SP"") is a town in the state of Kedah, in the northern part of Peninsular Malaysia. Sungai Petani is the second largest town in Kedah after Alor Star. The name Sungai Petani has its roots from "sungai" meaning river and "petani" meaning farmer in the Malay language. Sungai Petani in full means "Farmer's River", as there are a lot of paddy fields and farmers in the state. The word "petani" may also refer to "Pattani", a city in present-day Thailand to which the river was once connected. Even the old spelling of Sungai Petani was "Sungei Patani", without any reference to farming.

Sungai Petani is designated as a parliamentary area in its own right. A total of 983,851 people (2008) are able to vote. It is currently represented by Johari Abdul from Parti Keadilan Rakyat.

The parliamentary area of Merbok and part of the parliamentary area of Yan (Gurun) form part of Sungai Petani Municipal administrative area.

Sungai Petani has a high and medium-sized business community. Small and medium industry also play a part in the local economy, producing many products, from semiconductors to television tubes and from textile to wood products. Sungai Petani is also a booming business center with many large malls, franchise stores and business enclaves.

Sungai Petani has many malls and shopping centers such as Central Square, Village Mall, Lagenda Height Tesco, Sungai Petani North Tesco, Sungai Petani South Tesco, Giant Hypermarket, Econsave, Billion, Sp Plaza and Parkson.

The town is accessible through the Federal Route 1 and also the North-South Expressway. Sungai Petani has two highway exits while the Federal Route I runs across the city. Apart from that, it also has a train station and a makeshift express bus hub that caters to any destination within Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.

Sungai Petani also has a relatively below average local bus service called City Liner, with air-conditioned red coaches.The express bus station not far from Sungai Petani Railway Station. The railway station is managed by Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad.

The nearest airport is the Penang International Airport on Penang Island. Another alternative airport is the Sultan Abdul Halim Airport, Alor Star (the state capital of Kedah).

The Bujang Valley or Lembah Bujang, sometimes referred to as the Ancient Wonder of Kedah, is a rich historical site covering an area of about 400sq. km in Merbok (17 km from Sungai Petani), bounded by Bukit Coras (Choras Hill) and Gunung Jerai. This archaeological area was the site of an ancient Hindu-Buddhist kingdom that ruled the region from the 4th century AD. There is also an archaeological museum here which is known as The Lembah Bujang Archaeological Museum. This museum displays more than 2,500 artifacts from Malaysia's earliest civilization that have been unearthed from the surrounding excavation sites. Gold, gems, ceramics, Hindu gods and beautiful Buddha stone statues dating from the third to 14th centuries are all on display, though its main feature is Chandi Bukit Batu Pahat, a reconstructed temple built to worship the Hindu god Shiva.

States of Malaysia

Malaysia is a federation with 13 states ("Negeri") ("Wilayah Persekutuan"). Eleven states and two federal territories are located on the Malay Peninsula. The other two states and one federal territory are on the island of Borneo.

Malaysian states are divided between the two regions of Malaysia, with 11 states and 2 federal territories on West Malaysia and the other 2 states and 1 federal territory in East Malaysia. 
As Malaysia is a federation. The governance of the states is divided between the federal and the state governments, while the Federal government has direct control of the federal territories. The duties of the federal and the state governments are listed in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution of Malaysia. Theoretically, any matter not set out in the Ninth Schedule can be legislated on by the individual states. However, legal scholars generally view this as a "pauper's bequest" because of the large scope of the matters listed in the Ninth Schedule. The courts themselves have generally favoured a wide interpretation of the language of the Ninth Schedule, thus limiting the number of possible subjects not covered. The Ninth Schedule specifically lists the following matters as those that can only be legislated on by the states: land tenure, the Islamic religion, and local government.

The 13 states are based on historical Malay Kingdoms. 9 of the 13 states, known as the Malay States, retain their royal families. The Federal King (titled "Yang di-Pertuan Agong") is elected (de facto rotated) among the nine rulers to serve a 5-year term. The nine "Malay States" have a hereditary Ruler as titular Head of state and an executive Chief Minister or "Menteri Besar" as politically responsible Head of government. The rulers of Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Pahang, Perak, Selangor and Terengganu are styled Sultans (typically Islamic). Only Negeri Sembilan's elective ruler holds the rare, autochthonous Malay title of "Yang di-Pertuan Besar", whereas only the Ruler of Perlis is titled "Raja". Former British settlements and crown colonies of Penang and Malacca (both peninsular) and Sabah and Sarawak (both on Borneo) each have a federally appointed titular Governor (styled "Yang di-Pertua Negeri") and an executive Chief Minister or "Ketua Menteri".
Sabah and Sarawak have additional powers as part of the terms when they joined Malaysia, such as immigration controls. They have separate immigration policies and controls and a unique residency status. Passports are required even for Malaysians for travelling between these two states or between either state and Peninsular Malaysia, however Peninsular Malaysians who are on social/business visits up to three months are allowed to produce a MyKad or birth certificate and fill in a special form in lieu of a passport.
Each state has a unicameral legislature called "Dewan Undangan Negeri" ("DUN", State Assembly). Members of DUN are elected from single-member constituencies drawn based on the population. The state leader of the majority party in DUN is usually appointed Chief Minister by the Ruler or Governor. The term of DUN members is five years unless the assembly is dissolved earlier by the Ruler or Governor on the advise of the Chief Minister. Usually, DUN of the states in Peninsular Malaysia are dissolved in conjunction with the dissolution of the federal parliament, in order to have state elections running concurrently with the parliamentary election. However, Rulers and Governors hold discretionary powers in dissolving the DUN.Each state sends two representatives to the "Dewan Negara" (Senate), the upper house of the federal parliament.

The Parliament of Malaysia can legislate on issues of land, Islamic religion and local government in order to provide for a uniform law between different states, or on the request of the state assembly concerned. The law in question must also be passed by the state assembly as well, except in the case of certain land law-related subjects. Non-Islamic issues that fall under the purview of the state may also be legislated on at the federal level for conforming with Malaysian treaty obligations. Each state is further divided into districts, which are then divided into mukim. In Sabah and Sarawak districts are grouped into "Divisions".

 was a Malaysian state from the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 until it was expelled from the Federation on 9 August 1965.



Works of Rambhadracharya

Jagadguru Ramanandacharya Swami Rambhadracharya (better-known as Jagadguru Rambhadracharya or Swami Rambhadracharya) is a Hindu "guru", Sanskrit scholar, writer, poet, play writer, composer, singer, philosopher and "Katha" artist. He is living in Chitrakoot, India. His works includes poems, plays, lectures, commentaries, religious speeches, and musical works of his works. He has written more than 90 works, including published books and unpublished hand written books, and four epic poems, a Hindi commentary on Tulsidas' Ramcharitmanas, a rhythmic Sanskrit commentary on the Ashtadhyayi, and Sanskrit commentaries on the Prasthanatrayi sacred books. Many of his audio and video recordings have been released. He writes in Sanskrit, Hindi, Awadhi, Maithili, and many other languages. He is blind.

"Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam" is his most famous work. He won many awards for it, like the Sahitya Akademi Award for Sanskrit. He has also been given many other honors and titles as a writer and poet, like "Mahakavi" and "Kavikularatna".

His important literature works and musical works, grouped by their type, are listed below.











Rambhadracharya made Sanskrit commentaries named "Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam" on the Prasthanatrayi – Brahma Sutra, the Bhagavad Gita, and eleven Upanishads. These commentaries were released on 10 April 1998 by the then Prime Minister of India, Atal Behari Vajpayee. He made "Śrīrāghavakṛpābhāṣyam" on Narada Bhakti Sutra in 1991. Rambhadracharya then renewed—after five hundred years—the tradition of Sanskrit commentaries on the Prasthanatrayi. His commentary was also the second Sanskrit commentary on Prasthanatrayi of Ramananda Sampradaya, an the first was made by Ramananda himself and it was named "Ānandabhāṣyam". Rambhadracharya's commentary in Sanskrit on the Prasthanatrayi was the first written in almost 600 years.





Rambhadracharya's most controversial work was the critical edition of the Ramcharitmanas. It was published as the Tulsi Peeth edition. It was said that he changed the epic, but the dispute ended when Rambhadracharya said sorry for any problem caused by the publication. A writ was also filed against him but it was not accepted. This edition was published in 2005 by Shri Tulsi Peeth Seva Nyas.

Academy maniacs

Artyom Alexandrovich Anoufriev (born in October 4, 1992) and Nikita Vakhtangovich Lytkin (born in March 24, 1993 – died in November 30, 2021) () are two serial killers from Irkutsk, Russia.

On April 5, 2011, Anoufriev and Lytkin were arrested in connection with a series of six murders and attacks on local residents in Akademgorodok of Irkutsk. The attacks, which involved a mallet and knife, began in December 2010. Anoufriev and Lytkin were arrested after a video recording showing the dead body of a woman being mutilated with a knife was found on a camera belonging to Lytkin's uncle, who had become suspicious. According to media reports, the youths had been influenced by reading about the Alexander Pichushkin and Dnepropetrovsk maniacs (Igor Suprunyuck and Viktor Sayenko) on the Internet. Also, Anoufriev took part in a Russian neo_Nazi march. A psychiatric examination found them to be sane, and they told doctors that they had chosen weak and drunk people as their victims. On 2 April 2013, Anoufriev was sentenced to life imprisonment and Lytkin to 24 years.



Fermi paradox

Enrico Fermi's paradox wonders why, with the age and size of the universe and billions of stars and planets that have existed for billions of years, we have not detected any other alien civilizations. There have been attempts to resolve the Fermi paradox by finding evidence of alien civilizations, along with thoughts that such life could exist without humans knowing.

The physicist Enrico Fermi first asked the question in an informal discussion in 1950. A paper by Michael H. Hart in 1975 made scientists more curious and they began to study the question in more detail. This is why some people call it the Fermi–Hart paradox. Other common names for the same phenomenon are "Fermi's question" ("Where are they?"), the "Fermi Problem", the "Great Silence", and "silentium universi" (Latin for "the silence of the universe"; the misspelling "silencium universi" is also common).

Extraterrestrial life might exist, but humans may not know about it. To send signals across long distances in our galaxy, and the universe, is difficult. This is because the power output needed to project the signal would be very large. Coherent (laser-like) signals travel at the speed of light, but our own galaxy is 100,000 light years across. Alien civilizations may not be able to detect the signal, or they may not understand the communication or the method used to communicate. 

Space is full of dust clouds and magnetic fields, which would disturb or eliminate even a coherent (laser-like) beam of electromagnetic radiation. Thousands of tons of cosmic dust are thought to reach the Earth's surface every year. A signal would face much interference in any long-distance travel across space.

If it is difficult or impossible for us, it may also be difficult for other forms of life. As for other galaxies, the Andromeda galaxy is 2.5 million light years away. 

In our Galaxy, the time it takes for signals to travel is very large. Vast eras of time would pass before a reply could be received. There are theories about "worm-holes" in space in which communication could be sent through space more quickly, but these are just theories now. There is still a desire for space travel. Locally in the Solar System, the main goal is to get minerals which are scarce on Earth.


Drake equation

In 1961, Frank Drake wrote down an equation for the chance of a contactable alien civilization from another planet in the Milky Way Galaxy. This is known as the Drake Equation (sometimes called the Green Bank equation or the Green Bank Formula). Carl Sagan mentioned the Drake equation so often that it has been mistaken for the 'Sagan equation'. 

The Drake equation states that:

where:

and

We don't know the solution to the equation. 
Although written as an equation, Drake's formulation is not particularly useful for getting a value of formula_2. The last four parameters, formula_3 and formula_4 are not known. They are very hard to guess, with values ranging over many orders of magnitude. Therefore, the SETI League says the importance of the Drake equation is not in solving it, but in thinking about it. It may be more useful to think of it as a series of questions framed as a numbers game. 


 

Voyager Golden Record

The Voyager Golden Records are records that contain sounds and images chosen to show the life and culture on Earth. They show photographs of life on earth, including nature, cities, people and animals. They also have greetings recorded in 55 languages, songs from around the world, and non-musical sounds. The record gives specific instructions and distance measurements that can be used to pinpoint Earth's location as well. The record was designed by a team headed by Carl Sagan to communicate with extraterrestrial life.
These records which were sent in the Voyager spacecraft in 1977, are for alien life forms to see. The outside of the record is designed so that aliens could understand, with instructions about how to play the record next to images. However, the records can be seen as a symbol rather than a serious attempt to contact alien life forms.

Seneca the Younger

Lucius Annaeus Seneca was a Roman philosopher, poet and politician. He was born about 4 BC in Córdoba in Hispania (which is now in Spain). Seneca's father was a writer known as Seneca the Elder. Seneca's mother was called Helvia. Seneca often lived in the city of Rome. He died by suicide in year 65.

During the reign of Roman emperor Claudius, Seneca was sent in exile to the island of Corsica for nine years. This act was caused by Messalina who was the wife of Claudius. In 49 AD Claudius married his own niece Agrippina, and she called Seneca back to Rome to be a tutor for her son Nero. Nero became emperor in 54 AD, and Seneca helped him to rule the Roman Empire for the next five years. After 59 AD, Nero became like a tyrant, and Seneca lost control over him. In 65 AD Nero accused Seneca of helping the people in the Pisonian conspiracy who wanted to kill Nero. Seneca was probably innocent, but Nero forced Seneca to kill himself.

Seneca was a very famous writer. He wrote books on philosophy, and he also wrote plays. Most of his books still exist.

His philosophy books were about Stoicism. These books include his "Letters to Lucilius" and his "Essays" (or ""Dialogues""). Seneca wanted to find the right way for people to be happy, so he wrote about ethics. He believed that some emotions, including anger and grief, are bad and should be avoided. He wrote about the shortness of life, and he wrote about favours, mercy, friendship, and the need to help other people.

His plays are tragedies. They are based on Greek mythology, and have titles such as: "Hercules", "Trojan Women", "Phoenician Women", "Phaedra", and "Oedipus".

The story of Hasekura was unknown in Japan until the 19th century. This early diplomacy not included in official histories written in Japan in the 17th and 18th centuries. Information about this embassy

Hasekura was a subject of interest in Europe. In 1615, Scipione Amati published a book about Haskeura's journey. In 1616, a book about the Japanese diplomats was published in French in Paris.

Mexican Revolution

The Mexican Revolution was brought on by a major armed struggle in Mexico that started in 1911 by an uprising led by Francisco I. Madero against the long dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz.

Under his rule, power was concentrated in the hands of a select few, and the people had no power to express their opinions or to select their public officials. Wealth was likewise concentrated in the hands of the few, and injustice was everywhere in the cities and the countryside alike

The revolution was characterized by several socialist, liberal, anarchist, populist, and agrarian movements. Over time, it changed from a simple revolt against the established order to a multi-sided civil war.

There was less fighting after 1920, when Álvaro Obregón, the most important revolutionary leader who was still alive, became the president of Mexico.

Tanning bed

A tanning bed is a device that emits ultraviolet radiation to give people a tan (make their skin darker). Like the sun, a tanning bed can also cause a sunburn if the person stays in too long. There are many kinds of tanning beds, but most look like the one in the photo.

Tanning beds became popular in Europe and America because of the work of Friedrich Wolff around 1979. He patented his design and charged others to use his ideas. His company, "Wolff Systems" does not build the tanning beds, they research and design for the tanning lamp. Some of the early adopters of the Wolff technology include ETS, Inc., SCA, Sun Industries, Inc., Montego Bay, Sunal. Later, Friedrich sold Wolff Systems to his brother Jorg Wolff, who was the founder of Cosmedico, Ltd., another pioneer in the tanning industry.

Tanning beds use a special fluorescent lamps (16 to 32 per tanning bed) that creates visible light and ultraviolet light. Like all fluorescent lights, they use a ballast system to limit the electricity going to each lamp, which is most often 100 watts per lamp. The tanning beds use a special acrylic, or clear shield over the lamps. Most clear plastics will block ultraviolet, but this special type of plastic lets most of the ultraviolet light pass through. Most tanning beds also have a cooling fan system, to cool the electronics inside the tanning bed and keep it from getting too hot. All tanning beds have a timer, a device to limit the amount of time the person is exposed to the ultraviolet light. After a few minutes, the timer makes the bed turn off.

Unlike the sun, tanning beds do not help the body produce vitamin D as their bulbs emit mostly UVA light. The human body needs UVB light to produce vitamin D. Both the sun and tanning beds can damage your skin if you stay exposed for too long. Getting too much UV, or many sunburns can cause skin cancer, including melanoma, which can be deadly. There is a lot of controversy due to the risks. Most countries have many laws and rules that regulate tanning beds.

Barkly, Victoria

Barkly is a very small town in Victoria, Australia, about 180 kilometres northwest of Melbourne. It is located near the junction of the roads from Landsborough to Redbank, and from Frenchmans to St Arnaud. It is close to the western side of the St Arnaud Range National Park.

The area was first called the Navarre Diggings after gold was found in June 1859 by a group led by James Law (1827-1910). It was about six miles from the Navarre township. This caused a gold rush and there were soon about 700 people on the diggings. At the peak of the rush, there were over 6000 people in the area digging for gold.

James Law, who had come to Australia from Scotland, was given a reward of 150 pounds for being the first person to find gold. Other members of his group, John Fewster, W.R. Marshall and George Mill also were rewarded.

The name was changed to Barkly on 1 November 1861, after the Governor of Victoria, Sir Henry Barkly. The name was changed by the local gold warden, Mr. Warden Alley, a government official in charge of the diggings. A school was started, the Barkly Common School.

A cemetery, now called the Pioneer Cemetery, was begun close to the original diggings. The town of Barkly developed about two miles from this area, and a new cemetery was opened.

Barkly has a small Anglican church, a hall, and a few houses. The school has been closed and the buildings removed. There is a rose and lavender farm which is open to the public during the year. A headstone was placed on James Law's grave on 5 May, 1985. In 1996 a memorial stone was placed at the site of the first gold discovery.

Ice sledge hockey

Sledge hockey (known as sled hockey in the United States) is a sport that is designed to allow players who have a physical disability to play sport. 
Ice sledge hockey was invented in Sweden in the 1960s at a rehabilitation center. 




On the other side it has six to eight metal teeth for maneuvering and propulsion. Movement is done by using the metal teeth. The metal teeth cannot be longer than 1 centimeter beyond the stick, to help stop damage to the ice or injure of other players.

People who live in Kolín see ice sledge hockey as a normal sport. Kolín's team are on the top of table. Kolín's ice hockey players won last season. Many of Kolín's players play in Czech republic's representation.

Bullet-proof glass

Bullet-proof glass, or bullet-resistant glass, is a type of strong, clear material that resists bullets. Complete protection against all weapons is not possible.

It is usually made from two or more types of material, one hard and one soft. The softer layer makes the glass more elastic, so it can flex (bend) instead of shatter. There must be a clear view through the glass. Bulletproof glass varies in thickness from three-quarters of an inch to three inches.

A popular method is stick a special plastic film to the inner surface of ordinary glass. This 'security laminate' bonds to the glass with an adhesive. This gives a protection similar to the multi-layered bullet-resistant glass. Transparency is better, tint-free; thickness and weight is reduced as much as 50-70%. The laminate can be stuck on to existing windows; this a called a 'retrofit'.

The plastic provides little bullet-resistance. Glass, much harder than plastic, flattens the bullet. The plastic deforms, absorbing energy and (perhaps) stopping the bullet. The ability of the plastic layer to stop projectiles is directly proportional to its thickness. Bulletproof glass may be up to three inches thick.

All the parts of the glass must be transparent. The essential components are these:

The most usual method today requires three parts in layers:

A simpler version is used for car windshields. It consists of two panels of toughened glass, bonded together with polyvinyl butyal (PVB). The PVB stops cracks in the outer glass from spreading.

The idea is for guards inside to be able to shoot out, while attackers can't shoot in. One-way bulletproof glass is usually made of only two layers, a brittle layer on the outside and a flexible one on the inside. A bullet fired from the outside hits the brittle layer first, shattering an area of it. This absorbs some of the bullet's kinetic energy, and spreads it on a larger area. When the slowed bullet hits the flexible layer, it is stopped.

However, when a bullet is fired from the inside, it hits the flexible layer first. The bullet penetrates the flexible layer because its energy is focused on a smaller area; the brittle layer then shatters outward due to the flexing of the inner layer and does not significantly hinder the bullet's progress. A problem with this idea is that a two-layer glass has limited stopping power.

There is a new type of transparent armour with aluminium oxynitride instead of glass. As the outside 'strike plate' layer, it is much lighter and performs better than traditional glass/polymer laminates. Aluminum oxynitride 'glass' can defeat .50 caliber armour-piercing rounds. Various types of other materials which closely resemble glass are also being developed.

Certain types of ceramic can also be used for "transparent" armour. They are denser and harder than traditional glass. These new types of transparent ceramic armours make thinner armour with equal stopping power to traditional laminated glass.

Digital certificates

Digital certificates are electronic 'credit cards' that establish your credentials when doing a business or other transactions on the Web. It is issued by a certification authority (CA). It contains your name, a serial number, expiration dates, a copy of the certificate holder's public key (used for encrypting messages and digital signatures), and the digital signature of the certificate-issuing authority so that a recipient can verify that the certificate is real. Some digital certificates conform to a standard, X.509. Digital certificates can be kept in registries so that authenticating users can look up other users' public keys.

• Class 1 defines the certificate that does not hold any legal validity as the validation process is based only on a valid email ID and involves no direct verification.

• Class 2 category states that a person's identity is to be verified against a trusted,pre-verified database.

• Class 3 requires the person to present himself or herself in front of the registration authority and prove his or her identity.

Date Masamune

In the Edo period, the Date clan were identified as one of the "tozama" or outsider clans, in contrast with the "fudai" or insider "daimyō" clans which were hereditary vassals or allies of the Tokugawa clan.

Date sent troops which fought with the Tokugawa during the Battle of Sekigahara.

The feudal daimyō were sometimes identified with the suffix ""-kō"" (servant) combined with the name of a place or a castle. 

In 1601, Date built the Sendai castle; and the modern-day city of Sendai developed around it. Sendai"-kō" was one of the ways Date Masamune was described.

In 1613-1620, Date send Hasekura Tsunenaga on a diplomatic mission to the courts of Philip III of Spain in Madrid and Pope Paul V in Rome.

This historic visit is called the .

In 1991, a minor planet or main-belt asteroid 6859 Datemasamune was named after this Edo period historical figure.

Frank Drake

Frank Donald Drake PhD (May 28, 1930 – September 2, 2022) was an American astronomer (a scientist who studies the universe and what is inside it) and astrophysicist (someone who studies the physics of astronomy). He is most famous for joining in the first new SETI (Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence) experiment in 1960 and for making the Drake equation.

Born on the 28th of May 1930 in Chicago to Richard and Winifred Drake. As a young boy in Chicago, Drake loved electronics and chemistry. He says that he thought of life on other planets but never talked about the idea with his family or teachers.

He enrolled at Cornell University on a Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps scholarship. Once there, he began studying astronomy. A lecture from astrophysist Otto Struve in 1951 strengthen Drake's ideas about the possibility of extraterrestrial life. After college, he served briefly as an electronics officer on the USS Albany. He then went on to graduate school at Harvard in radio astronomy.

Drake's hobbies included lapidary and orchid cultivation.

Drake started his career undertaking radio astronomical research at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Green Bank, West Virginia, and for a short time in 1963 at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He conducted key measurements which revealed the presence of a Jovian ionosphere and magnetosphere.

In 1960, he started Project Ozma, which searches for extraterrestrial life. Drake is one of the pioneers of the modern field of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence with Giuseppe Cocconi, Philip Morrison, Iosif Shklovsky, and Carl Sagan. 

Drake joined the Astronomy faculty of Cornell University in 1963. Drake lead the conversion of the Arecibo Observatory to a radio astronomical facility. He lead Arecibo's improvements in 1974 and 1996. As a researcher, Drake was involved in the early work on pulsars. Drake was a professor at Cornell University and Director of the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center – the formal name for the Arecibo facility. In 1974 he wrote the Arecibo message.

Drake co-designed the Pioneer plaque with Carl Sagan in 1972, the first physical message sent into space. The plaque was made to be read by clever alien life if they find it. He later helped the making of the Voyager Golden Record. He was elected to the AAAS in 1974.

Drake was a member of the National Academy of Sciences where he chaired the Board of Physics and Astronomy of the National Research Council (1989–92). He also served as President of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. He was involved in "The Carl Sagan Center for the Study of life in the universe".

He was Emeritus Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz where he also served as Dean of Natural Sciences (1984–88). He served on the Board of Trustees of the SETI Institute.

Drake died on September 2, 2022 at his home in Aptos, California from natural causes at the age of 92.

Drake Planetarium at Norwood High School in Norwood, Ohio is named for Dr. Drake and linked to NASA.

Cape Mendocino

Cape Mendocino is a geographic feature of the northern Californian coastline. It is the westernmost point of the coast of California in Humboldt County.

The cape was named in the 1540s. The name honors Antonio de Mendoza. He was the Viceroy of New Spain.

This It has been known as a landmark since the 16th century. Spanish ships crossed the Pacific Ocean by following the Pacific trade winds. The North Equatorial Current brought them to the North American coastline. After landfall, the Manila galleons would sail down the coast to Acapulco in Mexico.

Francis Drake sighted Cape Mendocino in 1576.

Hasekura Tsunenaga's sailed from Japan to Cape Mendocino in 1613. Hasekura was on a diplomatic mission. He was traveling to the courts of Philip II of Spain and Pope Paul V.

The Cape Mendocino region is an active earthquake zone. In April 1992, three big earthquakes were centered near the cape.

The Mendocino Triple Junction is to the west of Cape Mendocino under the Pacific Ocean. It is a geologic triple junction where three tectonic plates come together. The San Andreas Fault, a transform boundary, runs south from the junction, separating the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. To the north is the Cascadia subduction zone, where the Gorda Plate is being subducted under the edge of the North American plate. Running west from the triple junction is the Mendocino Fracture Zone, the transform boundary between the Gorda Plate and the Pacific Plate.

Indo-Pakistani War of 1971

The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 was a military conflict between India and Pakistan. Lasting just 13 days, it is considered one of the shortest wars in history.

During the war, Indian and Pakistani forces fought on the eastern and western fronts. The war effectively came to an end after the Eastern Command of the Pakistani Armed Forces signed the Instrument of Surrender (1971) on December 16, 1971. After the surrender, East Pakistan seceded as the independent state of Bangladesh. Around 97,368 West Pakistanis who were in East Pakistan at the time of its independence, including some 79,700 Pakistan Army soldiers and paramilitary personnel and 12,500 civilians, were taken as prisoners of war by India.
The Soviet Union sided with the Bangladeshis, and supported the Indian Army and Mukti Bahini during the war. The Soviets thought that the independence of Bangladesh would weaken the position of its rivals—the United States and China. The USSR gave assurances to India that if a confrontation with the United States or China developed, it would take counter-measures. This assurance was enshrined in the Indo-Soviet friendship treaty signed in August 1971.

The United States supported Pakistan politically and with supplies. President Richard Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger feared Soviet expansion into South and Southeast Asia. Pakistan was a close ally of the People's Republic of China, with whom Nixon had been negotiating a "rapprochement". Nixon was planning to visit China in February 1972. Nixon feared that an Indian invasion of West Pakistan would give the Soviets control over the region. It would seriously undermine the global position of the United States and the regional position of America's new tacit ally, China. In order to demonstrate to China the "bona fides" of the United States as an ally, Nixon sent military supplies to Pakistan, routing them through Jordan and Iran, while also encouraging China to increase its arms supplies to Pakistan. The Nixon administration also ignored reports it received of the "genocidal" activities of the Pakistani Army in East Pakistan, most notably the Blood telegram. This prompted widespread criticism and condemnation both by Congress and in the international press.
The United States introduced a resolution in the UN Security Council calling for a cease-fire and the withdrawal of armed forces by India and Pakistan. It was vetoed by the Soviet Union. In the following days Nixon and Kissinger tried to get India to withdraw, but they did not succeed.

President Nixon requested Iran and Jordan to send their F-86, F-104 and F-5 fighter jets in aid of Pakistan. 

When Pakistan's defeat in the eastern sector seemed certain, Nixon deployed a carrier battle group led by the aircraft carrier USS "Enterprise" into the Bay of Bengal. The "Enterprise" and its escort ships arrived on station on 11 December 1971. According to a Russian documentary, the United Kingdom deployed a carrier battle group led by the aircraft carrier HMS "Eagle" to the Bay.

On 6 December and 13 December, the Soviet Navy dispatched two groups of cruisers and destroyers and a submarine armed with nuclear missiles from Vladivostok; they trailed U.S. Task Force 74 into the Indian Ocean from 18 December 1971 until 7 January 1972. The Soviets also had a nuclear submarine to help ward off the threat posed by USS "Enterprise" task force in the Indian Ocean.

The AVR was one of the first microcontroller families to use on-chip flash memory for program storage, as opposed to one-time programmable ROM, EPROM, or EEPROM used by other microcontrollers at the time.

Many people think that AVR stands for Alf (Egil Bogen) and Vegard (Wollan)'s Risc processor".

This architecture replaces older MCS-51 architecture. One machine cycle of MCS-51 takes 12 clock cycles and most of instructions are executed in one machine cycle.

AVR microcontrollers (MCUs) can execute most of instructions in single machine cycle too, but one machine cycle takes only one clock cycle. Performance per clock cycle is 12 times higher with AVR.

The core has 32 general purpose registers directly connected to ALU. It allowing two independent
registers to be accessed and instruction with them executed in one machine cycle.

XMEGA

Every AVR has some input/output ports. The port has up to 8 physical pins on its package. Every pin can be configured as input or output. If a pin is used for input, it can turn on built-in pull-up resistors through register PORTx. If a pin is configured as output, it can handleup to 40mA of load per pin and max 100mA for all pins on the port.

Vienna Circle

The Vienna Circle (in German: der Wiener Kreis) was the name of a group of philosophers who began meeting around the University of Vienna in 1922.

Many famous philosophers were members. Some of its members were:


Most followed the philosophy that came to be known as logical positivism.

Ludwig Wittgenstein's, 1921 book "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus" formed the basis for the group's ideas. Wittgenstein himself insisted that they did not understand him correctly and took to quietly reading poetry to himself during their meetings. 

The Vienna Circle was broken up when the Nazi party came to power in Germany in 1933, many of its members moved to the USA, where they became teachers in several universities. 

The Vienna Circle's influence on 20th century philosophy was very large.

University of Vienna

The University of Vienna (German: Universität Wien) is a public university in Vienna, Austria. It was founded by Duke Rudolph IV in 1365 and is the oldest university in the German-speaking world. It is the largest university in Austria and one of the largest in Europe.

National Memorial Day of the Exiles and Foibe

National Memorial Day of the Exiles and Foibe (in Italian: "Giorno del Ricordo") is Italian celebration in memory of ethnic cleansing's victims in massacres of Foibe and exiles from Dalmatia, Istria and "Venezia Giulia". 

Italian president Giorgio Napolitano took an official speech in which he stated:
Step for this celebration was allowed by the end of communist totalitarian regimes in Balkan nations because culpability of these crimes is of old politicians. Celebration was instituted in 2004 and first Memorial Day was held in 2005.


Pope Alexander IV

Pope Alexander IV (; c. 1185 – 25 May 1261), born Rinaldo Conti di Segni, was an Italian cleric of the Roman Catholic Church. He was the 182nd Pope from 1254 until his death.

Rinaldo Conti di Segni was born into the family of the counts of Segni. His relations included Pope Innocent III and Pope Gregory IX.

In 1227, Gregory IX made Conti a cardinal.

Cardinal Conti was elected pope on December 12, 1254. He chose to be called Alexander IV.

Pope Alexander was involved in Italian and European political disputes. The pope tried and failed to affect politics in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

The "nengō" "Keichō" means "Eternal Jubilance" or "Eternal Jubilance".




Senedd

The Senedd (), previously called the National Assembly building, contains the "debating chamber" and 3 committee rooms for the Welsh Parliament in Cardiff. The building is 5,308 square meters (57,100 sq ft) large.

After 2 selection processes were held, it was decided a new debating chamber for Wales was to built on a new site," Site 1E," at Capital Waterside in Cardiff Bay. 

Richard Rogers, an architect who had won the Pritzker Prize, won the international competition to design the building. It was designed to be sustainable, with renewable technologies, and to be energy efficient. The building was awarded an "Excellent" certification by the" Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method", the highest ever certification to be awarded in Wales, and was nominated for the 2006 Stirling Prize. The Senedd is now a symbol of Cardiff, and Wales.

The Senedd was constructed in two phases, the first in 2001 and the second starting in August 2003, until it was handed over to the National Assembly in February 2006.

Between the phases, the National Assembly changed contractors and the management structure of the project, but kept Rogers as architect.

Once finished, the building cost almost 6 times more than expected, and was finished 4 years and 10 months late (compared to estimates in 1997).

The cost grew because of the extra security that had to be added after the September 11 attacks, and because the National Assembly did not have an independent estimate of the project's cost until December 2000, three years after the original estimate. The costs of the second phase grew by less than 6% over budget, and was 6 months late, because of ICT problems.

It was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 1 March 2006 and it cost £69.6 million, which included £49.7 million in construction costs. The Senedd is part of the land owned by the National Assembly that includes Tŷ Hywel and the Pierhead Building.

Harley-Davidson

Harley-Davidson, or H-D for short, is an American motorcycle maker that started making motorcycles in Milwaukee in 1903. The company makes heavyweight motorcycles that are designed for cruising on the highway; they're called Harleys. Harley-Davidson is one of two big U.S. companies that made motorcycles that was still in business after the Great Depression; the other closed down in 1953.

Harleys have a special look and sound. Most new Harleys, except the V-Rods, are made to look like old Harleys. Harley-Davidson made small motorcycles in the US and in Italy, but they didn't sell well enough. They stopped making small motorcycles in the US in 1966 and in Italy in 1978.

Harley-Davidson and their motorcycles have many fans. The fans can join clubs and go to events or to Harley-Davidson's museum. Apart from selling motorcycles, Harley-Davidson also charges fees for companies to put Harley-Davidson's logos on the things they make. Less than one-hundredth of the money Harley-Davidson made in 2010 came from these fees.

William S. Harley, Arthur Davidson, William A. Davidson and Walter Davidson, Sr. were inducted into the Labor Hall of Honor. They were given the award for their good work for the H-D company and its workforce.

Eduard Kainberger

Eduard "Edi" Kainberger (born 20 November 1911 in Salzburg, died 7 March 1974) was an Austrian football player. He played as goalkeeper for SAK 1914 and the Austrian amateur footballteam. With this team he won the silver medal at the 1936 Olympic football tournament.
Together with his younger brother Karl he played for Salzburger AK 1914 in the Salzburger football league. He won several titles with the club and played for the first time in the national team in 1933 versus Hungary. At the 1936 Olympic games he won with the Austrian squad the silver medal and played 4 matches during the tournament. In 1938 he went to TSV 1860 München. Till his 42th year he played 1200 times as goalkeeper.

Hurricane Dolly

Hurricane Dolly was the first United States hurricane of 2008. The storm struck south central Texas with winds of around 100 miles an hour. Dolly caused no deaths within Texas. Damage, however, was estimated between $1 billion and $2 billion. The storm hit in July 2008. Despite the extensive damage, the name Dolly was not retired.

Ultralight material

Ultralight materials are very light substances. They include silica aerogels, carbon nanotube aerogels, metallic foams, polymeric foams, and metallic microlattices. The density of air is about 1.275 mg/cm, which means that the air in the pores greatly lowers the density of the material.

The lightest material ever made was invented in 2011. It is made out of a microscopic micro-lattice of hollow tubes – a criss-cross diagonal pattern with open spaces between the tubes. The researchers say the material is 100 times lighter than Styrofoam and is very strong. The material is low density: it has a density of 0.9 milligrams per cubic centimetre. Silica aerogels, the world's lightest "solid" materials, are only as low as 1.0 mg per cubic cm. The metallic micro-lattices are 99.99% air and only 0.01% solid. The metal used is nickel.

The material is not just light: it has some elastic properties. When it is squashed, the little tubes are also squashed, but when the pressure is removed, they rebound. A sample squashed to half its height rebounds 98% when the pressure is lifted. That makes the material similar in some ways to elastomers: they are materials used to cushion against shock.

Venona project

The Venona project was a long time secret plan which started in February 1943 by the United States Army Signal Intelligence Service. The project was transferred to the National Security Agency and had many names. However, VENONA was the last name that was used. The word VENONA is usually in capital letters (VENONA) but some writings use lowercase letters (Venona). VENONA was made to decrypt secret communications of Soviet intelligence agencies including NKVD, KGB and GRU. Decryption was possible because the encrypting one-time pads were reused.

The Venona project was most famous for the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg case known as LIBERAL and it ended in both of them being executed. VENONA exposed other spies including Klaus Fuchs and Alger Hiss. 

In July 1995, the first six documents were shown which included had 49 messages about the Soviets trying to get information on the United States atomic bomb and the Manhattan Project. In the next five more years, about 3,000 VENONA messages were made public.


Renaud

Renaud, popular name of Renaud Séchan (born 1952, Paris) is a French singer and songwriter. He sang "Dans mon H.L.M.", "Laisse béton", "Les Bobos", "Manhattan-Kaboul", "Marche à l’ombre", "Mistral gagnant", "Molly Malone" and "Mon beauf’". In the 90s, he was a contributor for the satirical weekly magazine "Charlie Hebdo".

In August 2005, Renaud married Romane Serda. In September 2011, Romane divorced Renaud on the account of his alcoholism and depression.




Mars Science Laboratory

The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) is a NASA mission to land and control a rover named Curiosity on the surface of the planet Mars. The MSL was launched on November 26, 2011. The MSL successfully did the first-ever precision landing on Mars. It landed on Mars at Gale Crater on August 5, 2012 and began exploring the surface.

The goal of the Curiosity rover is to study the history of Mars. It was to see whether Mars has, or ever had, an environment able to support microbial life. It indeed did that, finding evidence that 3 Billion years ago there was once water and an environment that could support life. This means it found that life could have existed, but not that it certainly did. It will also carefully look at samples scooped up from the soil and drilled powders from rocks.

"Curiosity" is five times as heavy as the Mars Exploration Rovers "Spirit" or "Opportunity" and carries more than ten times their mass of scientific instruments . It was launched by an Atlas V 541 rocket. "Curiosity" will be expected to work for at least 1 Martian year (668 Martian sols/686 Earth days), but may live a lot longer than that. It will explore Mars with greater range than any other rover.

Mars Science Laboratory mission is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program. The program is a long-term mission of robotic exploration of Mars. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology manages the program for NASA. The total cost of the MSL project is about US$2.3 billion.


Mayfair

Mayfair (first called The May Fair) is an area in central London. It is in the city of Westminster.

Mayfair is named after the annual fortnight-long "May Fair" that happened in a place that is Shepherd Market today (from 1686 until it was banned at that place in 1764). Until 1686, the May Fair was held in Haymarket, and after 1764, it moved to Fair Field in Bow.

Mayfair was bordered by Hyde Park to the west, Oxford Street to the north, Piccadilly to the south and Bond Street to the east, although the eastern boundary has been made longer recently, so now it goes all the way to Regent Street. Most of the area was first made between the mid 17th century and the mid 18th century.

The district is mostly commercial now. It has many offices in houses and new buildings. The price of rents in Mayfair are some of the highest in London and the world. There is still a large number of houses as well as some exclusive shopping and London's largest number of luxury hotels and many restaurants. Some buildings in Mayfair are:

The City of Westminster uses the Mayfair Library as a local library.

St. Nicholas College of London has lessons in English and other languages for people who live in and visit Mayfair.

Walla Walla is a town in Washington. It is known for its wine vineyards. It is near the Oregon state line. It is also the home to Whitman College and a state prison.

Overpass

An overpass is a bridge over a road, railway, or similar pathway. It allows people or vehicles to cross pathways without coming into contact with the traffic on the other pathway.

Folie à deux

Folie à deux is the name for a condition where an otherwise sane person develops the symptoms and delusions of a person suffering from psychosis. If more than two people share the symptoms or delusions, people speak about "folie à trois" (3), "folie à quatre" (4), "folie à plusieurs", or "folie en famille". Officially, the condition is known as induced delusional disorder or shared psychotic disorder today, but many publications still use the original terms, which were developed in France in the 19th century.
Today, there are two main forms of the condition:
Newer studies seem to indicate that this classification may not be sufficient to fully describe 'folie à deux'. There may be more symptoms than are usually described in the cases above. Also, in many cases, separating the two patients may not be enough to make the condition go away in one of them. Also, the person described as "sane" before developing the folie à deux may already be suffering from a psychiatric illness, or may develop one. 

The condition was first described in an article pubilshed by Ernest-Charles Lasègue and Jules Farlet in 1877.

Mass hysteria can be seen as a form of folie à deux.

SnRNP

Small nuclear RNA (snRNP, or 'snurps'), joins with proteins to form spliceosomes. The spliceosomes govern alternative splicing.

The background to this is that, in eukaryotes, most genes code for a protein in separated strings of DNA. This is because, of a total gene, coding bits (exons) are separated by non-coding bits (introns). The process called alternative splicing can produce many possible proteins from the gene parts because the proteins are put together in different ways. Alternative splicing produces alternative messenger RNAs, and these produce different proteins. Spliceosomes control the details of the splicing.

The two essential components of snRNPs are protein molecules and RNA. The RNA found within each snRNP particle is known as small nuclear RNA, or snRNA, and is usually about 150 nucleotides in length. The snRNA component of the snurp is specific to individual introns because it 'recognises' the sequences of critical signals at the ends and branch sites of introns. The snRNA in snurps is similar to ribosomal RNA: it acts both as an enzyme (catalyst) and builds structure.

SnRNPs were discovered by Michael Lerner and Joan Steitz.
Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman also played a role in the discovery, winning the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1989 for their independent discoveries that RNA can act as a catalyst in cell development.

Google Nexus

The Nexus is a series of Android smartphones and tablets produced by Google in co-operation with some phone-making companies. The purpose of the Nexus phones and tablets is to offer a "pure Android experience", in which the phones or tablets come free of carrier or manufacturer modifications and with an unlockable bootloader to allow for further development and end-user modification. Nexus phones and tablets were once considered the "flagship" Android devices. The Nexus line was later replaced with the Google Pixel.

Phones in the series:


Tablets in the series:


The series also had a media streaming device known as the Nexus Q, however it was never officially released because it didn't have enough features to make it worth using.



Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked

Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked is a 2011 movie starring Jason Lee as David Seville. The main characters for the movie are Alvin, Simon, Theodore and the Chipettes. The movie was released on December 16, 2011.

Dave Seville (Jason Lee), the chipmunks, and the chipettes are on a cruise with Dave for a family vacation. Dave discovers that his old boss, Ian Hawke (David Cross) is working as a pelican on the Cruise. Dave warns Alvin to not have too much fun but Alvin does not listen and him and the other chipmunks get blown away while holding onto a kite and they end up stranded on a deserted island. Dave tries to take a hanglider to find the chipmunks but after Ian tries to stop him and they both end up in the ocean.

On the island, the chipmunks try to find food and they meet a castaway, Zoe (Jenny Slate). She shows the chipmunks her hut she built with a zip line. Eleanor sprains her ankle after falling from the zip line and Simon gets bitten by a spider. This gives him a neurotoxin disease making him believe he is a French explorer named "Simone." Simone asks Jeanette to dance, thinking she is beautiful, much to Alvin's dismay. Zoe takes Simone, Jeanette, Eleanor and Theodore to a waterfall and Simone finds a cave full of gold and jewellery.

The next day, Alvin and Brittnay notice the volcano on the island is active and decide they had better leave the island after Dave and Ian arrive at the island. They begin to build a raft to escape the island. Simone and Jeanette are still looking for food. Zoe knocks Simone out with a golf ball, and captures Jeanette. She forces her to give her all the gold, by tying Jeanette to a rope and putting her down into the cave. Even though Jeanette refuses, Zoe still makes her.

Later, Simon wakes up as his normal self and cannot remember anything after the spider bite. When the others cross a tree log to find Jeanette but when the ground begins to rumble, Zoe lets go of the rope. Jeanette follows Dave and Alvin back but gets caught by Zoe who still forces Jeanette to give her the gold. Simon saves Jeanette from Zoe. Alvin cuts the rope, releasing Zoe's grip and as the log begins to crack, Dave hangs on and Ian finally convinces Zoe to help save Dave.

They escape the island on the raft just as the volcano erupts and later are rescued by a rescue helicopter, Jeanette gives Zoe a bracelet that Simone gave her as a present. Alvin and Dave reconcile.

The chipmunks and chipettes perform at the International Music Awards and Ian gets his job back by selling Zoe's story to Hollywood.

In the epilogue on the flight home, Alvin speaks on the pilot's microphone that the plane is heading for Timbuktu. The flight attendant says the flight will leave now and Alvin accidentally pushes the food cart and it hits Dave and Dave yells "ALLLLVINNN!!"

Halkett boat

A Halkett boat is a type of lightweight inflatable boat. The boat was first created by (1820–1885) during the 1840s. Halkett had been interested in the problems of travelling in the Canadian Arctic. He wanted to make a boat that was light enough to be carried over bad terrain, but strong enough to be used in very bad weather conditions.

Halkett's first design was a boat that was made using cloth combined with rubber. This boat could be filled with air (inflated) to float on water or the air could be removed (deflated) so it would be smaller and lighter to carry. When deflated, the hull of the boat could be worn as a cloak. The oar used as a walking stick and the sail could be used as an umbrella. Next, he created a two-man boat that was small enough to fit into a knapsack. When it was deflated, It could be used as a waterproof blanket.

Many people who explored Canada liked his ideas but they were not very useful to most other people. He tried to show the Royal Navy that the boats could be useful to them but did not succeed. He also could not sell them fishermen and people that hunted duck. They were commercially unsuccessful. Only two Halkett boats are still known to exist. One belonged to Orcadian explorer John Rae. The other is in the Hudson's Bay Company Museum Collection at the Manitoba Museum.

Peter Halkett was a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy in the 1840s. He was the son of John Halkett, a director of the Hudson's Bay Company who had lived in Canada for many years before returning to England. Peter Halkett was interested in the exploration of the Canadian Arctic for a long time. He was very interested in John Franklin's Coppermine Expedition of 1819–1822. This expedition had many problems.
Franklin explored the northern coast of Canada for three years. He was looking for the Northwest Passage. His search ended very badly. It was said that people killed other members of the expedition and that some even ate the other people. 11 of the 20 members of the group were killed. The people that were not killed had to eat lichen, their own boots, and the remains of dead animals left by wolves. They had become stranded on the wrong side of the Coppermine River after their boats had been destroyed in a storm. John Richardson tried to swim to safety. This caused him very bad hypothermia. One person in the party built a small canoe from canvas and willow. They had to cross the river one at a time using the canoe.

Halkett was an amateur inventor. During his spare time while in the navy, he worked on building a boat that would be small and light enough to be carried through wilderness, but strong enough to carry people in safety across wide bodies of water. He chose to build a boat in which all parts could also be used as clothing or items that the user would normally carry with them.

Halkett made a waterproof cloak. It was created from an early form of Macintosh cloth. This cloth was made of cotton combined with India rubber. The inside of the cloak was an airtight and watertight inflatable ovoid. It was made of four different airtight sections. If one section was damaged and could not hold air, the others would still keep the boat floating. The cloak had a pocket that held a paddle blade and a small bellows. The person wearing the cloak would carry a walking stick. This stick was also used as the handle for the paddle. There was also a large umbrella which was used as a sail for the boat. The cloak weighed about . It took three to four minutes to inflate the boat. Once the boat was inflated, it could carry six to eight people.

In early 1844, Halkett tested the first boat-cloak on the River Thames. He paddled it without taking on any water. His test went very well. Because of this, he took the boat-cloak with him while on naval service. He used it whenever he could to test it under many different sea conditions. In November 1844, Halkett wanted to test the boat-cloak in bad weather conditions. The seas of the Bay of Biscay were usually very bad, but the weather was unusually calm when he got there. The boat-cloak was very well liked by explorers. John Richardson (who had almost died during the 1819–1822 Coppermine expedition) wrote that "Had we been possessed of such a contrivance in our first expedition, I have little doubt of our having brought the whole party in safely".

Because of how well the boat-cloak did during his tests, Halkett built a larger version. This boat could be folted into a knapsack. When inflated, it could carry two men. Each man would use a paddle on each side of the boat. When deflated, the boat could be used as a waterproof blanket. This would allow the users to sleep on wet ground. The people in charge of the Royal Navy though the boat could be useful to some people but was not likely to be useful to the Navy. On 8 May 1845 Lord Herbert, First Secretary to the Admiralty wrote to Halkett that "My Lords are of an opinion that your invention is extremely clever and ingenious, and that it might be useful in Exploring and Surveying Expeditions, but they do not consider that it would be made applicable for general purposes in the Naval Service".
Although the Navy saw no use for Halkett's boats in general naval service, this larger boat was liked very much by explorers. John Franklin bought one to take on the 1845 expedition. This expedition ended badly. All 129 men and their two ships were lost and never found. Franklin believed that Halkett boats were very needed to travel in Canada. He gave the boat that was to be used for his expedition to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land so that Simpson could use in his travels in the region. He got another boat from Halkett to be used on his last expedition.

Orkneyman John Rae, known by the Inuit as (, "He who takes long strides"), was a Hudson's Bay Company surgeon. He became a surveyor of the Canadian Arctic. Unlike most Europeans of that time, Rae believed that the local people knew the best ways to deal with the very bad weather conditions. He travelled Inuit-style, using sledges and snowshoes. He slept in snow igloos. Rae took a Halkett boat on his first expedition in 1846. He said that it was "most useful in crossing and recrossing the river at Repulse Bay". He also said that "although in constant use for upwards of six weeks on a rocky coast it never required the slightest repair" and "ought to form part of the equipment of every expedition".

In 1848, the Royal navy sent out people to find out what had become of the ships and men of Franklin's expedition. The search party was led by John Richardson and John Rae. They had a Halkett boat bought by the government. The party did not find Franklin, but they learned that the Halkett boat very useful. During the search, they used the single boat to move their entire party across a river in 14 trips. Rae said that although the rubber of the boat became stiff from the cold, it was not hard to warm it to soften the material when needed. Halkett boats were also taken on 6 other expedition that were sent to look for Franklin. During these they were used for fishing.

In 1851 French explorer Joseph René Bellot led another expedition to find Franklin. This was paid for by Franklin's wife. Bellot took a Halkett boat-cloak on the journey. He said that it was "of immense value in a country where the want of wood renders it impossible to form any sort of raft". Bellot's expedition did not find Franklin. It was not until 1853 that an expedition led by Rae (using with "two beautiful Halkett boats") found a group of Inuit who told them that they saw men dragging a boat four years earlier. Their bodies were found soon after that.

Even though the boats were said to be very good for lake-fishing and duck-shooting and were shown in the Great Exhibition of 1851, they did not sell well. Halkett's boat were not widely used except in the field of Canadian exploration. Halkett died on 23 March 1885, aged 65, and the building of his boats stopped. John Rae gave his boat from the 1853 expedition to a Miss Peace of Kirkwall. Many years later it was found and is now in the Stromness Museum at Orkney. A second boat is in the Hudson's Bay Company Museum Collection at the Manitoba Museum.

Marshall Islands at the Olympics

The Marshall Islands have competed in two Olympic Games. They first competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics. They also competed in the 2010 Winter Olympics. They have not won any Olympic medals. In their first Olympics, they had 5 athletes compete in 3 different sports.

Mackenzie Large Igneous Province

The Mackenzie Large Igneous Province (MLIP) is a major Mesoproterozoic large igneous province of southwestern, western and northwestern Canada. It is a group of igneous rocks which were formed during a massive igneous event starting about 1,270 million years ago. The large igneous province extends from the Arctic in Nunavut to near the Great Lakes in northwestern Ontario.

MLIP is one of the largest Proterozoic magmatic provinces on Earth, as well as the world's largest and best-preserved continental flood basalt terrain. This huge area of igneous rock was spewed out in a short time, geologically speaking. The MILP is much larger than other well-preserved large igneous provinces. The standard size classification for large igneous provinces is a minimum of . However, the Mackenzie dyke swarm itself occupies an area of at least , making the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province larger than the Ontong Java Plateau in the southwestern Pacific Ocean or the U.S. state of Alaska.

The Mackenzie Large Igneous Province was caused by processes other than normal plate tectonics and seafloor spreading. Igneous rocks of the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province are generally mafic in composition, including basalt and gabbro.

Like most large igneous provinces, the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province was caused by a mantle plume—an upwelling zone of abnormally hot rock within the Earth's mantle. As the head of the Mackenzie plume reached the Earth's lithosphere, it spread out and melted catastrophically to form large volumes of basaltic magma. This resulted in the creation of a stationary volcanic zone west of Victoria Island, called the Mackenzie hotspot.

The Coppermine River Group is a sequence of Mesoproterozoic continental flood basalts. They are part of the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, Canada. This is one of the largest flood basalt provinces on Earth, covering the area with a volume of approximately .

Between 1,200 and 740 million years ago, a series of flood basalt eruptions took place. At the northern portion of the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province, vast volumes of basaltic lava paved over a large part of the northwestern Canadian Shield. This constructed a large lava plateau with an area of , a volume of lavas of at least 500,000 km (120,000 cubic miles). 

This extensive area of flood basalt lava flows has been called the Coppermine River flood basalts. With an area of and a volume of 650,000 km (120,000 cubic miles), the Coppermine River flood basalt sequence is larger than the Columbia River Basalt Group in the United States. It compares in size to the Deccan Traps in west-central India. This makes the Coppermine River flood basalts one of the largest flood basalt events ever to appear on the North American continent, as well as on Earth. The maximum thickness of the Coppermine River flood basalts is and has 150 lava flows, each to thick.

The Coppermine River flood basalts occurred shortly after a period of crustal uplift. The uplift then collapsed. This sudden uplift was likely caused by rising magma of the Mackenzie plume, which caused the Mackenzie hotspot. The Coppermine River basalts show over 100 individual lava flows.

Memory of the World Programme

The Memory of the World Programme is a part of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). It is part of a strategy for preserving history. The programme focuses on archives and libraries.

The UNESCO programme began in 1992. It promote the importance of historical documents.

The program is administered by a body known as the International Advisory Committee (IAC). There are 14 members. Each is appointed by the UNESCO Director-General.

Select additions to the World Register are chosen at biannual meetings of the IAC.


The Jikji Prize was established with the South Korean government. The $30,000 prize and all costs associated with the prize are funded by South Korea. 



Nelson Aldrich

Nelson Aldrich (1841-1915) was a liberal Republican United States Senator from Rhode Island. He was the leader of his party in the Senate during the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt. He was the maternal grandfather of Nelson Rockefeller. He was a freemason. He sponsored the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Bill. 

Regent Street

Regent Street is a large shopping street in London<nowiki>'s</nowiki> west end. It is well known to people who live in London as well as tourists. It is also famous for its Christmas decorations.

Regent Street is named after Prince Regent (who became George IV).

Regent Street was designed by architect John Nash. The street layout he made is still there, but the only building left in Regent Street that was there when it was first designed and built is All Souls Church.

Every single building in Regent Street is protected as a Listed Building. Together, they make up the Regent Street Conservation Area.

The street can be bought in the United Kingdom version of the board game "Monopoly".



Giorgio Orsini

Giorgio Orsini (referred often as Giorgio da Sebenico, Giorgio di Matteo, born 1410, died 1475) was an Italian medieval sculptor and architect from Dalmatia. Orsini lived and worked mainly in the city of Sebenico (modern-day Šibenik, Croatia), Republic of Venice.
