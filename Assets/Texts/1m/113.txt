El amor brujo

El amor brujo (Translation "Love, the Magician") is a ballet in one act and two scenes of Manuel de Falla music. Choreography: Pastora Imperio. Libretto by Gregorio Martínez Sierra. First performance in Madrid, Spain, at the Teatro Lara April 15, 1915.

It was written after the famous dancer Pastora Imperio expressed to him the desire to expand his repertoire with a new song and a dance.

The story, told to the librettist's mother Pastora Imperio, is based on a popular legend. He stars a gypsy named Candela that has been abandoned recently by a man who believed he loved her. So she turns to a witch so that prepare a love potion to bring back her man from her; she goes to the lair of this witch, but finds it empty, so you sudden witch herself and the spell fails. The man who had betrayed her appears in the den of a sudden, he does not recognize the mistakes for the witch and he is afraid. Candela warns him that he had recently launched a curse on him that can be broken only by returning from its previous woman. The man, who has fear of the witch, promises that will do so, then recognizes Candela, but now the spell worked and he can no longer do without her now that he has in hand.

Falla, who draws profusely and with exquisite wisdom to the historical repertoire of Spanish music has given us one of his most beautiful pieces with its Amor Brujo, rich melodies and tempo changes; Although the story is very exciting and quite short, the music, the choreography and environments create a very gypsy and manage to transport the viewer completely. Many pieces of the De Falla Ballet were highly appreciated by pianists and became famous. One of them, "The dance ritual del Fuego" (Ritual Fire Dance), was the horse of battle of the composer.

Carbon sink

A carbon sink is a natural or artificial reservoir that stores carbon-containing chemical compounds for a long period. Carbon sinks absorb more carbon than they release. 

A forest, ocean, or other natural environments produce surplus carbon. Carbon sinks are very important in our environment. They can be natural or man-made. Soil, ocean, forest and the atmosphere all store carbon and this carbon moves in a continuous cycle. The largest carbon sinks become swamps, bogs, and eventually coal measures.

In the regular carbon cycle, CO comes from the atmosphere and then is taken by plants and uses it in the process of photosynthesis.

Stefán Karl Stefánsson

Stefán Karl Stefánsson (; ; 10 July 1975 – 21 August 2018) was an Icelandic actor and singer. He was best known for playing antagonist Robbie Rotten on the children's television series "LazyTown".

Stefán Karl's career started in 1994. At the age of 19, he worked as a puppeteer for television. During his years as a puppeteer, he had also been studying at the Drama Academy of Iceland. However, he was not satisfied with how Iceland views their drama standards. He remembered that his principal at his high school said that "acting is not about making faces and changing your face". He did not agree with his high school principal.

Later, Stefán Karl had been invited by Magnús Scheving, an Icelandic gymnast, to portray one of the characters in the second "LazyTown" play. Scheving created the plays because he was concerned that Iceland's younger generation is not doing enough exercise. Stefán Karl explained that "[Scheving] wanted the kids to get healthier, so he created this musical called "LazyTown". He played Sportacus, the fitness fanatic, and I was Robbie Rotten, the guy who liked to stay indoors and sleep". After initial success with the musical, Nickelodeon eventually made a deal with the creators of "LazyTown" to air the first 40 episodes of "LazyTown" along with a special studio built in Iceland. During the first few years of "LazyTown" in the early 2000s, Stefán Karl initially knew no English, but soon became fluent.

Stefán Karl lived in Los Angeles with his wife Steinunn Ólína Þorsteinsdóttir, three daughters, and one son. In June 2018, he was awarded the Order of the Falcon. He had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Tourette syndrome.

Stefán Karl announced in October 2016 that he had been diagnosed with bile duct cancer. On the same month, GoFundMe campaign was subsequently created by "LazyTown" head writer Mark Valenti to pay his living costs when he became too ill to work. The campaign was popularized by various YouTube users uploading parodies of Stefán Karl's work. This eventually made the songs "We Are Number One" and "The Mine Song" from "LazyTown" become Internet memes. In August 2017, Stefán Karl stated he was in remission. He clarified on his GoFundMe campaign that while his metastases had been removed after successful liver surgery in June 2017, he still had the disease and had refused further adjuvant therapy.

In March 2018, Stefán Karl was diagnosed with inoperable bile duct cancer, and said that he was undergoing chemotherapy to increase the length of his life. In April 2018, he announced that he personally chose to stop his chemotherapy, and then began to shut down all his social media accounts.

He died on 21 August 2018 at the age of 43. His wife stated that Stefansson didn't want to a funeral when he died. Instead, she had said that his body will be secretly scattered into a distant ocean. 

It was announced by his manager, Cheryl Edison, that the Stefán Karl Academy & Center for the Performing Arts will be opened in Switzerland in the year 2019 as a memorial to his career.

Stefán Karl has been credited in various works including plays, television series, films, and games.

Guiana Shield

The Guiana Shield is a geographic region found in northeast South America. It is one of the three cratons of the South American Plate. It is a 1.7 billion-year-old Precambrian geological formation that forms part of the South American northern coast.

The higher elevations on the region are called the Guiana Highlands, which is where there are mesas or "table" mountains called "tepuis".


"Guiana" and "The Guianas" are often used as collective names for Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana, and sometimes even includes the portions of Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil which are on the Guiana Shield.

The Guiana Shield is In six countries; they are, from west to east:

The Guiana Shield is roughly bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Orinoco river to the north and west, the Negro river (an important tributary of the Amazon river) to the southwest, and the Amazon river to the south.

The Guiana Highlands is formed by small plateaus and mountain ranges. The western part of the Highlands, mainly in Venezuela, is where are the higher mountains. From west to east, the mountains ranges and plateaus are:


The highest point in the Guiana Shield is Pico da Neblina () in Brazil at . Pico da Neblina is the highest summit of the larger "Serra do Imeri", a plateau on the Venezuela-Brazil border; it is also the highest mountain in Brazil.

Many rivers start on the Guiana Highlands and most of them flow to the north, into the Atlantic Ocean. Some of them are:

In the region there are some notable waterfalls such as the Angel Falls, high, in Venezuela, and the Kaieteur Falls, high, on the Potaro River in the Pacaraima Mountains of Guyana.

As a whole, the Guiana Shield region has a tropical climate characterized by a relatively high mean annual temperature over at sea level. Because of the Guiana Shield is just north of the equator, its climate varies primarily according to elevation and the effects of the trade winds. The trade winds blow from the east and northeast, off of the Atlantic Ocean onto northeastern South America.

The heaviest rains usually occur between May and August, whereas the rainy season from December to January is shorter and less intense, with rains mostly along the coast. In areas where there is only one rainy season, the driest part of the year is January to March; in areas where there are two rainy seasons the driest months are March and October. However, even during most dry seasons, frequent storms provide adequate moisture to allow evergreen tropical moist forests to persist in most low elevation parts of the region.

The climate data for Santa Elena de Uairén weather station () in La Gran Sabana at an altitude of are:.

Since the individual peaks in the Guiana Highlands have been isolated from each other for millions of years, many plants and animals have evolved in a different way on each mountain.

Many of the mountains are covered in permanent clouds and mist washing all the soil away, and leaving barren rock and water. Because of this many plants are carnivorous and feed on insects and small animals.

So far over 2,000 species of plants been found, and more than 50% are endemic to this region, meaning they are found only here, and many are only found on one peak.

Some minerals are found in large amounts in the Guiana Shield; diamonds, gold and bauxite are some of them. The large-scale mining of these, and other minerals, is creating some environmental problems.
In the Guiana Shield, there are several protected areas, as National parks or reserves; some of them are:

The Aoi Festival or Aoi Matsuri (葵祭) is one of Kyoto's most three famous festivals.  The other two are the Gion Festival and Jidai Matsuri. The Aoi Festival takes place on May 15 each year. The main attraction of the festival is a large parade in Kyoto. Over 500 people dress in the aristocratic style of the Heian Period (794-1185) for the parade. They walk from the Imperial Palace to the Kamo Shrines. Aoi is Japanese for "Hollyhock" The festival is named after the Hollyhock leaves that are worn by the people in the parade.

The Aoi Matsuri began in the 7th century. This was before Kyoto was made the national capital in 794. Its exact origins are not known. It is likely that natural disasters were happening, These were believed to be caused by the deities of the Kamo Shrines. After the Emperor made offerings to the gods, the disasters ended and a tradition was begun. The festival's official name is Kamo Matsuri because of the shrines.

The festival grew in popularity. During the Heian Period, when people used the word festival, they meant the Aoi Matsuri. In modern times, the parade shows the high regard that the festival has. There are people riding horses, large bouquets of flowers, decorated carts pulled by oxen, and many women in kimono with the year's Saiō.

The Saiō was a young female member of the imperial family. She was the high priestess of the Kamo Shrines. During festivals, the Saio performed rituals at the shrines. In modern times, an unmarried woman from Kyoto is chosen each year to be Saio. She must go through purification ceremonies before the festival. She is taken through the procession on a palanquin.

Pyruvic acid

Pyruvic acid is the simplest of the keto acids, with a carboxylic acid and a ketone functional group. Pyruvate, the conjugate base, is an important part of several metabolic chemical reactions. Pyruvate is an important chemical compound in biochemistry.

Pyruvic acid can be made from glucose through glycolysis. One molecule of glucose breaks down into two molecules of pyruvate. These are then used to give more energy to living animals, plants and microorganisms. It is then changed back to carbohydrates (such as glucose) by a metabolic chemical reaction named gluconeogenesis, or to fatty acids through a similar reaction. It can also be used to make the amino acid alanine and can be converted into ethanol or lactic acid by fermentation.

Pyruvic acid gives energy to cells through the citric acid cycle, when oxygen is present (aerobic respiration), and also makes lactate when oxygen is lacking (fermentation).

Nintendo Switch

The Nintendo Switch (known as NX before its release) is a video game console created by Nintendo. It is the successor to the Wii U and was released on March 3, 2017.

The Switch is a hybrid console, similar to the lesser known Sega Nomad. The player can either connect it to a television or use it by itself as a handheld gaming device. It uses controllers called Joy-Cons, which can attach to both sides of the console. They can be attached to a grip when playing on a TV. The Joy-Con also have a feature known as HD Rumble, which allows for immersive vibration of the controllers. There is an infrared sensor on the bottom of the right Joy-Con that can detect shapes, and distance.

There are more than 1000 games for the Nintendo Switch. Some notable titles include "", "Super Mario Odyssey, Kirby Star Allies," and "Pokémon Sword and Shield", with new titles coming out for the Nintendo Switch such as "".

In 2012, Nintendo released the Wii U, but it was a complete failure. It remains the worst-selling mainline console Nintendo has released. However, Nintendo's handheld console, the Nintendo 3DS, was selling quite well. In 2017, the Nintendo Switch was launched through a trailer. The Wii U would end up being discontinued before the Switch even came out. Most Wii U games have been ported and/or upgraded on the Switch, with games like Mario Kart 8 and Super Mario Maker 2 being some notable ones.

The Nintendo Switch received widespread acclaim. The Switch became the fastest-selling console, outselling the Wii U in only nine months. In May 2020, it was announced that the Nintendo Switch had sold over 107 million consoles since its release. As of November 2020, the Switch is the best-selling Nintendo home console. On 6 May 2021, Nintendo Switch sold more units than the Nintendo 3DS, with 84.59 million units. However, a known issue with the Switch is "Joy-Con drift". This is when a joystick is broken, and the joystick "drifts" and sends an input to the console on its own, without someone touching it. One of the main causes of this is dirt. Dirt can get into the Joy-Con and get under the stick, which causes joystick drift.

The Switch sold over 132.5 million units as of November of 2023. According to an extrapolation, the Switch is going to be the best-selling console of all time.

B chromosome

B chromosomes are chromosomes which are not needed for the life of a species. They are also called 'supernumerary' or 'accessory chromosomes'.

In addition to normal chromosomes (the karyotype), many species have B chromosomes. Wild populations of many animal, plant, and fungi species have B chromosomes. These chromosomes are not essential for their life, and are lacking in many individuals. So a population might have individuals with 0, 1, 2, 3 (etc.) supernumeraries.

Most B chromosomes are mainly or entirely heterochromatic, and so do not code for anything. Some, such as the B chromosomes of maize, contain sizeable euchromatic segments, and therefore do code for some products.

It seems unlikely that supernumeraries would survive in a species unless there was some positive advantage. In a few cases this has been identified. For instance, the British grasshopper "Myrmeleotettix maculatus" has B chromosomes with a satellite DNA. They occur in warm, dry environments, and are scarce or absent in humid, cooler places.

It is thought that B chromosomes are parasitic elements like selfish DNA. Various scenarios have been suggested as to how they arose.

Executive Order 13769

Executive Order 13769, also called Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States, is an executive order signed by United States President Donald Trump on January 27, 2017. It limits travel to the United States from some countries and by all refugees.

The order said that no more than 50,000 refugees could be let into the United States in fiscal year 2017 until it was deemed to be in the national interest by President Trump. It stopped the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days (about four months). After that 120 days, the program would start again for individual countries. The order also stopped the entry of refugees from Syria. The order tells some Cabinet secretaries to stop entry of nationals from countries that do not meet adjudication standards under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The United States Department of Homeland Security lists these countries as Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. 

The Department of Homeland Security later allowed green card holders and dual nationals of other countries to enter the United States. However, they had to have a passport or nationality of a non-listed country.

There were many lawsuits that tried to stop the order. One was "State of Washington v. Trump", which resulted in a temporary restraining order (TRO). The TRO was issued on February 3, 2017. It stopped much of the executive order. The issue is about whether the order is legal and whether it is against the United States Constitution.

More than 100 travelers were held. They were held for hours without family or legal assistance. Up to 60,000 visas were taken away.

Protests against the order took place in airports and cities.

The order was criticized by Democratic and Republican members of U.S. Congress, Catholic bishops, business leaders and universities.

The RMS "Titanic" is christened for its maiden voyage. Passengers and crew get on board the ship. The ship departs from port on April 10, 1912 and heads out into sea.

The ship receives a number of ice warnings from other ships. However, only a few of the messages are sent to Captain Edward J. Smith. The captain does not slow down the ship, or consider an alternate route.

Late on Sunday, April 14, one of the lookouts sees an iceberg in front of the ship. "Titanic" turns hard to port and tries to avoid the iceberg. But the ship eventually hits the iceberg on its starboard side. The first five compartments, below the waterline, are ripped open. Thomas Andrews, the ship's maker, inspects the damage. He then learns the ship will sink within two hours. Making matters worse, the ship does not have enough lifeboats for all the people aboard.

A distress signal is sent out. The radio operator on the RMS "Carpathia" hears the distress call, understands the emergency and alerts Captain Arthur Rostron. Rostron, right away, orders the "Carpathia" to head to the "Titanic" at full speed. But unfortunately, it will take four hours to reach the "Titanic".

Captain Smith orders Officers William Murdoch and Charles Lightoller to begin lowering the lifeboats. Women and children are let on the boats first. However, the women and children are not that happy about getting into the lifeboats. They are then forced into the boats by officers.

The "Carpathia" is racing to the "Titanic" site. Before "Carpathia" can get there, though, "Titanic" sinks.

On the "Carpathia", Lightoller is told by Rostron that only 705 people have survived. They have only passed one body. 


As with many "Titanic" movies made prior to 1985, this movie shows "Titanic" sinking in one piece. But in reality, the ship broke in two before sinking.

The movie won several awards, including a Golden Globe Award for Best English-Language Foreign Film.

Pig iron

Pig iron is iron with a high carbon content. Pig iron is made by smelting iron ore into ingot form, in a blast furnace. It’s called pig iron because when being cast, each ingot being cast looks like a Piglet suckling milk from a sow.

Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Chinese knew about pig iron, and were producing it as early as 1100 BC.

Pig iron is refined into Wrought iron by melting it and blowing hot air through it. Pig iron can also be turned into gray iron.

Originally, pig iron was poured out the bottom of the furnace and shipped to a steel mill for processing. Now, we turn the metal into pellets before shipping it.

Creos Luxembourg

Creos Luxembourg S.A. owns and manages electricity networks and natural gas pipelines in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

Creos was formed as a result of a deal to unite:
On 23 January 2009 Cegedel S.A. and Saar Ferngas AG were moved to Soteg S.A. This made a new energy group named Enovos. It included the parent company Enovos International S.A. and the two main subsidiaries: Creos (formerly Cegedel S.A.) in charge of network activities, and Enovos Luxembourg S.A. in charge of production, sales and marketing. Enovos and Creos each have a subsidiary for the German market: Enovos Deutschland and Creos Deutschland.
In 2010, Creos bought the natural gas networks from Luxgaz Distribution S.A. On 1 January 2011, the City of Luxembourg transferred its electricity and natural gas networks and its teams to Creos in exchange for owning units of property in Creos. The owned units of property increased from 5.71% to 24.57%. Creos also owns units of property in Luxmetering (the Interest Economic Group which has piloted the smart metering network) since 2012 , Balansys (joint-venture between Creos and Fluxys Belgium) and Ampacimon since 2015 and NEXXTLAB since 2018.

In order to make a difference between the parent company and its subsidiaries – energy provider Enovos and grid operator Creos –, Enovos International is now called Encevo. Private equity firm Ardian sold its stake up to 24.92 percent in Encevo to China Southern Power Grid International, the second grid operator in China and in the world.
Following a reorganization of the Encevo Group in Germany at the end of October 2021, Creos Luxembourg sold its stake in Creos Deutschland Holding GmbH  . On 1 July 2023, Laurence Zenner, previously head of CFL Cargo, became the new CEO of Creos Luxembourg.

Creos Luxembourg S.A. plans, constructs and maintains the electricity and natural gas transmission and distribution networks in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

In Luxembourg, following the liberalisation of the energy markets, an independent organisation – the Luxembourg Institute of Regulation – organises and supervises access to the networks. The tariffs are subject to its approval. The energy suppliers are guaranteed transparent access to Creos's networks.

The majority of the electricity in Luxembourg comes from Germany via two double high-voltage 220,000 volt (220 kV) lines connected to the German network. Interconnection with Belgium has become operational with a phase shifting transformer at the Schifflange Centre in October 2017. Around 15% of the energy is produced locally (biogas, cogeneration, wind turbines, hydroelectricity and photovoltaics). 
The electricity is send to the six stations (Flebour, Roost, Itzig/Blooren, Heisdorf, Bertange and Schifflange) where the voltage is reduced from 220 to 65 kV. It is given to industries and large municipal distribution networks. The voltage is then reduced from 65 kV to 20 kV in more than 60 transformer stations in the whole country. The electric energy obtained is distributed to SMEs, towns and villages where the transformers reduce the current voltage to 0.4 kV before distributing it to the final consumer. A control centre, known as Electricity Dispatching, controls and manages these high and medium-voltage networks.
The total length of the Luxembourg electricity network managed by Creos is 10,123 kilometres, including 593 kilometres of high-voltage lines, 3,702 kilometres of medium-tension lines and 5,828 kilometres of low tension lines.
Thanks to its connections with Germany, Belgium and France, Luxembourg is linked to the interconnected gas networks throughout Europe. Monitored by Dispatching Gas, the high and medium-pressure pipelines distribute the gas to 60 communes that are connected to the national gas network. Pressure-reducing stations that supply the local networks then reduce the gas pressure. Creos distributes natural gas in 45 communes.

Since 1 October 2015, Creos and Fluxys Belgium, in collaboration with their respective regulators ILR and CREG, have united the national markets of Luxembourg and Belgium into one Belux market. This integration, the first between two European Union member states, reflects the will of the European Union to create an European gas market without borders. Balansys, the joint venture between Creos and its Belgian counterpart Fluxys, is the balancing operator in the Belux zone from 1 June 2020. It is responsible for ensuring that the gas market is well supplied, without one of the two suppliers having to pay an entry fee for its gas on the other's market.

Creos has four regional centres. They build, operate, maintain and repair the electricity and natural gas networks.

The Roost Centre covers the central and northern regions. It covers the high, medium and low-voltage electricity services and the medium and low-pressure natural gas services, the central store and the mechanical and electrical workshops.

The Schifflange Centre covers the southern part of the country.

The Luxembourg City Centre, which covers the capital and the communes of Strassen and Hesperange, moved together with the Strassen headquarters to a new site in Merl at the end of 2021.

The Contern Centre manages and adjusts the meters, in particular smart meters.

Dispatching for electricity and natural gas together with the monitoring rooms for remote network control and management are installed in Bettembourg since 2020.

Creos works in two national projects; smart grids, electromobility and energy management.
In accordance with the law of 7 August 2012 that puts the European Energy Efficiency Directive into Luxembourg law, all the gas and electricity meters must be changed in the country, independently of the network operator. Creos has made 300,000 smart meters that record information about energy in Luxembourg. This includes 250,000 electricity meters and 50,000 gas meters. The installation of these new electricity and gas meters – called Smarty – in Luxembourg homes will allow the creation of networks with real intelligence: smart grids. These smart grids can monitor decentralised electricity production (like wind turbines and photovoltaic panels), regulating the variations of the feeds into the distribution networks with greater precision and managing the demand peaks linked with the charging of electric vehicles more effectively. The law from 7 August 2012 also demands that the metering system must be able to receive water and heating.
Creos will install 800 public charging stations for electric cars and hybrid plug-in cars across the country. Each charging station will have two charging points, and the network – called Chargy – will include 1,600 parking spaces for electric vehicles. Creos will be responsible for the deployment, operation and maintenance of the public charging infrastructure on its distribution network, a total of 749 stations out of the 800 that are to be installed. In January 2021, Creos inaugurated the first two Superchargy ultra-fast charging terminals at Kirchberg, a district of Luxembourg City. By 2023, 88 SuperChargy direct current (DC) terminals will be along the country's main roads and motorways, as well in some Park & Ride car parks, 19 locations in all.

Creos is also preparing the Third Industrial Revolution of the country. This convergence of IT, renewable energy and means of transport will have an impact on how the power grids are managed. For this evolution, the grid operator joined forces with Powerdale S.A . to create NEXXTLAB, which aims to make innovative solutions in the field of energy management with electro-mobility.

Cherry picking

Cherry picking is when someone picks the case which supports his opinion.

For example, suppose twenty studies have been done on a new medicine and 19 say it works, but one says it does not work. To "cherry pick" is to use the one failed study to "prove" that the medicine is useless. It is a type of confirmation bias, where a person sees evidence for what they want or expect to see, and ignores evidence which goes against their belief.

The term cherry picking comes from when people harvest cherries from a tree - the cherry picker only takes the reddest, ripest fruits. If someone looked at all the fruit the person had picked, they might think that all the cherries were red, until they went to the tree and saw lots of pale, unripe cherries still on it.

Cherry picking as a term is quite negative, as it implies that the person doing the cherry picking is trying to deceive the audience, or simply does not care about the facts.

When applied to subjects like medicine and science, cherry picking is considered "bad science". or a sign of pseudoscience.

Cherry picking can take several forms. The most obvious case of cherry picking is where only evidence that supports a given argument is used, and other evidence which does not support it or goes against it is ignored or covered up. Other examples can include giving a lot of emphasis to evidence which supports the idea but barely any to other evidence, and taking a quote out of context so that it seems to have a different meaning than it originally did.

Pseudoscience is when untrue claims are made to appear as though they have a scientific basis, even though they do not. Many pseudoscientists cherry pick real scientific evidence to support their claims. It is quite common in science for some studies to contradict others, for example in cases where different methods are used to measure an outcome, or where human error or chance may lead to unusual results. This means that there is often a study someone can use to support their claim, and they can cherry pick that one study even if many more contradict it.

Svalbard Global Seed Vault

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault () is a seed bank (a place where seeds are kept) in Norway. It is on the island of Spitsbergen, near Longyearbyen, in the Arctic Svalbard archipelago. It is about from the North Pole. Conservationist Cary Fowler worked with the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), to start the vault.

The vault is there to save many different kinds of plant seeds. The seeds at the vault are copies of seeds from other places around the world. Copies of seeds are kept in case the seeds in other places are lost. Three organizations decided how to manage the vault. Those organizations were the Norwegian government, the Global Crop Diversity Trust (GCDT) and the Nordic Genetic Resource Center (NordGen).

The Norwegian government paid for building the vault. It cost about 45 million Norwegian kroner () to build. Storing seeds in the vault is free. Norway and GCDT pay to operate the vault. GCDT gets money from organisations such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and from different governments worldwide.

The current champion is Roman Reigns, who is in his second reign for more than one thousand days.

With the return of the WWE Brand Extension in the middle of 2016, a draft took place in July 19. The WWE Champion Dean Ambrose was drafted to "SmackDown". And as a result, "Raw" was left without a world title. On the July 25, 2016 episode of "Raw", Stephanie McMahon and the general manager Mick Foley created the WWE Universal Championship to be the world title of the program. The first champion was determined at SummerSlam on August 21, 2016. Finn Bálor beat Seth Rollins to win the title.

At WrestleMania 38 Night 2 on April 3, 2022, SmackDown's Universal Champion Roman Reigns defeated WWE Champion Brock Lesnar in a Winner Takes All match to win both championships and become the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion. WWE called the match a championship unification match; however, both titles's histories are still seperately active with Reigns being a double champion, defending both titles together across both brands as the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. On the April 24, 2023, episode of Raw, WWE Chief Content Officer Triple H announced that regardless of what brand Reigns was drafted to in the 2023 WWE Draft, he and his undisputed championship would become exclusive to that brand. Triple H then prsented a new World Heavyweight Championship for the other brand, which was won by Seth "Freakin" Rollins at Night of Champions. Reigns was drafted to SmackDown and the World Heavyweight Championship became exclusive to Raw. On the June 2, 2023, episode of SmackDown, Triple H gave Reigns with a new singular championship belt to represent the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. Despite this, Reigns' manager Paul Heyman continued to carry the old WWE and Universal Championship belts until the end of July.

The title shares its name with the old Women's Championship. However, the new title does not share the same title history as the original. The first Women's Championship was unified with the Divas Championship in 2010. As result, they combined their histories.

In the draft that took place on July 19, 2016, Charlotte was drafted to "Raw" and the title was renamed "WWE Raw Women's Championship" on September 5. It became exclusive to SmackDown
on April 28, 2023, when champion Bianca Belair was drafted there. It got its old name back on June 9 and its design was also changed.

Ed Garvey

Edward R. "Ed" Garvey (April 18, 1940 – February 22, 2017) was an American lawyer, politician and progressive activist.

Garvey was born in Burlington, Wisconsin. He studied at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Garvey worked for the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), the labor organization representing the professional American football players in the National Football League (NFL). In 1970 Garvey was assigned to counsel union president John Mackey regarding negotiations on a new four year contract with the league's owners. 

Garvey was later offered the position of executive director in the now-certified NFLPA in 1971.

Garvey served as its executive director until 1983, through two strikes (in 1974 and 1982) and invoking antitrust legislation in his many court battles with the league.

Garvey directed the NFLPA though a series of court battles that led, in 1975, to the ruling in Mackey v. NFL that antitrust laws applied to the NFL's restrictions on player movement. 

In 1976, armed with leverage regarding player movement from team to team, Garvey and the union won major concessions from the owners. Garvey's negotiations with the league exchanged the players' threat of pursuing a system of unfettered free agency for an improved package of player benefits.

In 1986, Garvey ran for the U.S. Senate from Wisconsin, losing to Republican incumbent Bob Kasten by a small margin In an unsuccessful bid for Wisconsin governor in 1998 against three-term incumbent Tommy G. Thompson, Garvey sought to highlight campaign finance reform and limited contributions to his campaign to a fixed amount per donor. Thompson won by a wide margin.

Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee

Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee or Golrokh Iraee (Farsi: گلرخ ایرایی), born about 1980, is an Iranian writer, accountant and human rights defender who advocates against the practice of stoning in Iran.

Golrokh began serving a six-year sentence in October 2016 for “insulting the sacred” and “propaganda against the state,” after she wrote a story about stoning. Iraee was released from prison on January 3, 2017 after a 71-day hunger strike by her husband and a protest on Twitter that got international attention, but she was returned to prison January 22, after her husband stopped his hunger strike.

Stoning to death is controversial in Iran, and often used against women. In 2010 there was strong international criticism of Iran because of the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani. Ashtiani was freed in March 2014, after nine years on death row. Another Iranian woman, Fariba Khalegi, is believed to be in prison and in danger of stoning.

In September 2014, the Iranian government searched the home of Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee and her husband Arash Sadeghi (Farsi: آرش صادقی) in Tehran. The guards took laptops, notebooks and CDs. They found an unpublished story Iraee wrote about stoning a woman. In the story, a young woman watches the movie, “The Stoning of Soraya M”, becomes angry, and burns a copy of the Koran.

After the story was found, Iraee and her husband Sadegh were arrested by four men believed to be from the Revolutionary Guards. They took Sadegh to Evin Prison, but they took Iraee to a secret place for three days. They did not allow her to see a lawyer or to talk to her family. Then they took her to Evin Prison. For 17 days, they questioned her for hours, blindfolded her, and threatened to kill her. While they interrogated Iraee, she had to listen to the guards kick and choke her husband in the next cell.

Iraee had two short hearings. Her first hearing was about her husband's political activity. She was not permitted to speak. During the second hearing she was in the hospital after surgery, but the court would not look at her medical records. Her first lawyer was pressured to drop her case, and her second lawyer was prohibited from representing her.

In October 2016, Iranian officials called Ebrahimi Iraee on a friend's telephone and told her to go to Evin Prison to start serving a six-year prison sentence. They did not have an arrest warrant, as the law requires. Iraee was convicted of “insulting Islamic sanctities” and “spreading propaganda against the system.”

Amnesty International called on the Iranian governement to set Iraee free. According to Philip Luther, Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa, "She is facing years behind bars simply for writing a story, and one which was not even published – she is effectively being punished for using her imagination. Instead of imprisoning a young woman for peacefully exercising her human rights by expressing her opposition to stoning, the Iranian authorities should focus on abolishing this punishment, which amounts to torture."

On October 24, Iraee's husband Sadeghi went on a hunger strike in prison to protest Iraee's imprisonment. There were demonstrations outside Evin Prison, which is very unusual. Even though Twitter is prohibited in Iran, a Twitter campaign used the hashtag #SaveArash On January 3, 2017 Iraee was set free, and Sadeghi stopped his hunger strike. Sadghi's family said he was having many medical problems, including vomiting blood, and respiratory, heart, kidney and gastrointestinal problems. They took Sadeghi to the hospital, but after only a few days, on January 7 they returned him to prison, even though the doctors said he needed to be in the hospital.

Iranian authorities said Iraee and Sadegh could be temporarily out of prison on bail if they got property bonds worth 7 and 10 billion rials (US$300,000) for Arash Sadeghi and 5 billion rials (US$150,000) for Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee.

Iraee brought a property deed for the bail, but the government said they had a new order, and that Iraee must return to prison. Iraee refused to return to prison, but when she tried to visit her husband in the hospital, on January 22 the Revolutionary Guards at Sarallah Headquarters forced her to return to Evin Prison.

Golrokh was transferred from Evin prison to a prison in the town of Varamin in March 2018. At this time Golrokh and fellow human rights defender, Atena Daemi were being held in a quarantine section of Shahr-e Rey prison. It has been reported that the conditions are poor, with the activists still wearing the same clothing as when they arrived.

As of 9 March, Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee, who suffers from severe muscular pain, had been on hunger strike for over one month (35 days), and had reportedly been forcibly given IV fluids since her arrival to the prison.

Walt Koken

Walt Koken (born October 9, 1946, Columbia, Missouri) is an American claw-hammer banjo player and old-time fiddler, who received the Nashville Old-Time String Band Association's Heritage Award for 2016. Koken was prominent in the old-time music revival during the 1960s, and continues to be a leader and mentor in the old-time music community today.

Koken defines old-time music as, “fiddle-centric and related music (ballads, etc.) from the Piedmont, Appalachia, the Gulf coast, central Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, northern Virginia, western Pennsylvania, and westward with the pioneers all the way to the coast.” "Old-time music is for dancing and its songs are for lifting us above our burdens. Our music gives relief from the everyday burdens of modern life, and an insight into a simpler time, with a glimmer of hope for us all.” 

Koken's mother, Helen Hawkins Koken Pickel, was a classical pianist and a beloved kindergarten teacher. Her family was from England before immigrating to America. His father, John C. Koken, was a math professor whose family emigrated from Germany. The Koken family arrived in New Orleans in 1850, then traveled up the Mississippi River to St. Louis. By 1892, the Koken Barber’s Supply Company of St. Louis held two barber chair patents; one for the first reclining Koken chair and one for the first hydraulic lift chair. In 1915 Walter F. Koken received a patent for the first electric Barber’s Chair. 

Koken started playing banjo at the age of thirteen. “In 1959, my brother had broken his arm, and heard that playing guitar might be a good way to get its strength back. He got his old guitar with a warped neck and high strings, and started strummin’ it. I really thought that was neat, and one day he came to me and said, “Why don’t you get a banjo, and we’ll make some money?”

Since 1965, Koken has played in multiple bands: the Busted Toe Mudthumpers, the Muskrat Ramblers, the Fat City String Band, the legendary Highwoods Stringband, and The Cacklin’ Hens and Roosters Too!. 

Currently, he plays fiddle-banjo duets with his partner and soul-mate Clare Milliner, as well as with Milliner, Kellie Allen, and Pete Peterson as the old-time string band, Orpheus Supertones. In 2011, Koken completed his multi-year literary collaboration with Clare Milliner, "The Milliner-Koken Collection of American Fiddle Tunes."

Irish Americans

Irish Americans () are an North American ethnic group. They are American citizens whose ancestors were Irish.

People are called Irish Americans if: 

Most Irish people came to the United States between the 17th to mid-19th centuries.

The largest number of Irish people came to the United States between 1820 and 1860. During this time, one out of every three people who immigrated to the United States was Irish. Between 1820 and 1860, 1,956,557 Irish people arrived in the United States. 75% of these immigrants - about 1.5 million Irish people - came after the Great Famine of 1845-1852 (also called "The Great Hunger". Many Irish people died while trying to travel to America on coffin ships. Between 1820 and 1930, about 4.5 million Irish people moved to the United States.

Most Irish people who came to the United States during the 1800s lived in big cities where there were many other Irish people. They did this so they could help and protect each other. Many stayed near the ports where they arrived, like Boston, New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Many Irish people also lived in Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, and Baltimore.

Most of the Irish immigrants who came to America in the 1800s were Catholic. At that time, most of the United States was controlled by Protestants who were ethnically English, Anglo-Saxon, and Germanic.

Many Irish immigrants were treated badly. For example: 

Some politicians spoke out against Irish people. For example, in 1836, Benjamin Disraeli wrote:

In the mid-1950s, a political group called the Know-Nothing Movement tried to get Catholic politicians fired from their jobs.

Stereotypes about Irish Americans did not go away. For example, President Richard Nixon once said: 

In 2013, about 33.3 million Americans - about one in every 10 - reported having some Irish ancestry. This is about seven times the number of people who actually live in Ireland.

Allotropes of iron

Iron is the most often-used example of a metal with allotropes. These allotropes are α-iron, aka ferrite, γ-iron, aka austenite, and δ-iron, which doesn’t have another name. At higher temperatures, ε-iron exists, called hexaferrum. There is evidence for a fifth form, but it has not been proven to exist.

Delta Iron is Iron below 1538°C. Austenite is created when Iron cools further, to 1394°C. Beta ferrite Iron is the term for Iron that’s paramagnetic. Alpha Iron is all Iron below 912°C. Epsilon Iron is created above 10 GigaPascals and below 100°K.

Anthracite iron

Anthracite iron is iron smelted using anthracite coal, and is a form of pig iron. Anthracite Iron aided the industrial revolution by allowing iron production to skyrocket.

Charcoal prices rose so it was more expensive to create iron. So anthracite was used instead.

Data matrix

Data matrix is an invention of a two-dimensional barcode.

The coded information can be text or numbers. It is read by a barcode reader.

Error correction codes are often used to increase reliability. Even if one or more cells are damaged, the message can still be read. A data matrix symbol can store up to 2,335 alphanumeric characters.

Beta ferrite

Beta ferrite is ferrite that is paramegnetic instead of ferromagnetic, heated to a temperature of above 771°C.

β-Fe may refer to an unproven to exist fifth allotrope of iron, only produced once in Uppsala University. Iron was compressed to 35-40 GPa then heated to 1500°K and scanned. The result was never reproduced.

Robin Stenuit

Robin Stenuit (born June 16, 1990 in Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve) is a Belgian road bicycle racer. His speciality is sprinting.

He achieved several victories, among others the Grand Prix de la ville de Nogent-sur-Oise and the Memorial Van Coningsloo, both in 2015.



Bloomery

A bloomery is a type of furnace that was once widely used for smelting oxides. Bloomeries were the first smelters able to smelt iron. The result of using a bloomery is a mass of iron and slag called a bloom. This is called sponge iron, because it is porous like a sponge. Sponge iron is usually refined into wrought iron. Bloomeries are no longer used in smelting, because blast furnaces are better.

A bloomery consists of a chimney with heat-resistant walls made of earth, clay, or stone. Near the bottom, pipes (made of clay or metal) enter through the side walls. The pipes allow air to enter.

To use a bloomery, charcoal is inserted into the chimney, then heated. Then roughly the same volume of iron is inserted. A common product of this process is fayalite, which occurs when iron mixes with slag.

Iron began to be used around 1200 BC.

China appeared to not use bloomeries, seemingly skipping to blast furnaces. However, bloomeries have been found in China, though these were likely only brought from other locations, and not built in China.

Bloomeries had been used in Sub-Saharan Africa before 500 BC.

European Bloomeries started very small, smelting about 1kg of iron with each use, but got larger over time, smelting about 14kg on average in the fourteenth century.

Bog iron

Bog iron is a form of iron found in swamps. Bog Iron is generally found in a spring.

Smelting bog iron has existed since pre-Roman times. Most iron smelted during the Viking era came from bog iron. In Russia, bog iron was the main source of iron until the sixteenth century.

Iron was produced by Vikings around 1000 AD.

Mining Bog Iron had been done in Virginia as early as 1608, and more bog iron has been mined in New Jersey and Maryland.

This match was for the WWE World Championship. "SmackDown" wrestler Dean Ambrose won a match for the title at "Battleground" on July 25 against "Raw" wrestlers Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins. So "SmackDown" needed to find a challenger for Dean for "SummerSlam" and they had a six-pack challenge to find the challenger.

Then, Finn beat Cesaro, Kevin Owens and Rusev in a fatal 4-way match and Roman beat Chris Jericho, Sami Zayn and Sheamus in another fatal 4-way. Finally, Finn and Roman fought in a normal match where the winner would face Seth at SummerSlam and Finn won this match.

Anna J. Cooper

Anna Julia Haywood Cooper (August 10, 1858 – February 27, 1964) was an American author and educator. She was one of the most prominent African-American scholars in United States history. She was the fourth Black American woman to earn a Ph.D. She was a mathematician and a Classics scholar. She fought for women's right to be educated and the strength the United States could build by educating Black women and men.

Cooper was born in 1859. She was born into slavery. Her mother was Hannah Stanley Haywood, a slave in the home of prominent landowner George Washington Haywood. She had two brothers, Rufus and Andrew. Her grandfather was a carpenter that was sent to help build the capital of North Carolina. After the slaves were free Cooper’s brothers became good carpenters.

Cooper was freed at the age of six. She then went to school.

Cooper went to a school for Black children called St. Augustine. By the age of ten she was teaching math. Cooper had to beg them to let her in the Greek class. It was only for boys. Cooper thought that it was unfair that due to her gender she was kept out of the Classical classes. Thankfully she did not give up and was able to “sit in” on the male Greek classes.

Cooper felt frustrated that she had to fight to get the opportunity to study Classics. She wanted all students to be offered Greek. She kept fighting to make it equal. Eventually, the school provided Greek classes for male and female students.

She stayed at St. Augustine for 14 years as a student and a teacher of Latin, Greek, and Math. In 1877 she married another teacher, George A.G. Cooper. He died two years later.

After going to St. Augustine she went to the college Oberlin College in Ohio. Again, she could only take the women's courses. Classes for girls taught household skills. The classes for women did not require taking Latin, Greek or even advanced mathematics. Cooper asked to be in the men’s courses. She excelled at the full classical education at Oberlin. Cooper got her bachelors degree in Math in 1884. She earned her Master's Degree in 1887.

In 1911 Cooper started working on her Ph.D. at Columbia University. Four years later her brother died. She took responsibility for raising his five grandchildren. She had to take a break from studying. In 1924 she started studying again, at the University of Paris in France.

In 1925, at the age of 67, Cooper earned her Ph.D. Her doctoral thesis was: "L'Attitude de la France à L'égard de l'Esclavage pendant La Révolution (Slavery and the French and Haitian Revolutionists)". Her writing showed that slavery and bad treatment of Black peoples were a big part of revolutions in the France and Haiti. She was the fourth Black American woman to reach that level.

Cooper had a varied career.

In 1887 she became part of the M Street High school faculty. She taught mathematics, science, and Latin.

In 1902 she became the principal of M Street High School. When Cooper was Principle she enhanced the academic reputation, plus lots of her graduates entered Ivy leagued schools. The District of Columbia did not renew her contract. They did not think that Black students needed to be prepared to go to college. Cooper was not scared. After she continued her career by teaching in Lincoln University for four years. In 1910 Cooper was rehired by M Street High School.

In 1930, Cooper retired from teaching to assume the presidency of Frelinghuysen University, a school for black adults. She served as the school’s registrar after it was reorganized into the Frelinghuysen Group of Schools for Colored People. Cooper remained in that position until the school closed in 1950.

"A Voice from the South by a Black Woman of the South" was Cooper's first book. She published it in 1892. She argued that women should be educated. She especially wanted Black women to be educated. Cooper's book made her a popular public speaker. She spoke to a wide variety of groups, which included the National Conference of Colored Women in 1895. She was also at the first Pan African Conference in 1900.

In the 1890s Cooper was also involved in the black women's club. Middle class black women would help the less fortunate black women.

At the age of 67 Cooper received her doctorate from Paris.

Cooper died at the age 105 in 1964. Anna J. Cooper was a fighter for what is right and hopefully her legacy reigns on.

Collect call

A collect call, also called a "reverse charge call", is a type of telephone call. Usually, when a telephone call is made, the person who makes the call pays for the call, rather than the person who receives the call at the other end. In a collect call, though, the person making the call wants the person they are calling to pay for the call instead.

In the past, these kinds of calls could only be done with a operator, who would need to ask the person receiving the call if they want to be charged for it. If the person receiving it does not want to be charged, the call cannot go through. Today, computers have made it possible to make or receive collect calls without talking to a person.

Collect calls used to be made a lot using payphones, but they are becoming less used since mobile phones and VoIP technology has come around and made long-distance calls cheaper to make.

It has been found out that the day of the year in which the most collect calls are made is Father's Day, even though the day when the most phone calls are made altogether is Mother's Day.

Mohamed Cheikh Ould Mkhaitir

Mohamed Ould Mkhaitir or Mohamed Cheikh Ould Mkhaitir (Arabic: محمد الشيخ ولد امخيطير )(1985 – ) is a Mauritanian blogger and political prisoner. He was sentenced to death after he wrote an article about discrimination and the caste system in Mauritania.

Mohamed is an engineer from the northern industrial city of Nouadhibou. He belongs to the Moulamines, or blacksmith group, the lowest social group in Mauritania. He worked for SAMMA, a company partly owned by the Canadian mining corporation Kinross.

Mohemed wrote an article called "Religion, religiosity and craftsmen," that criticized Mauritania's caste system. The article was published on the news website Aqlame on December 31, 2013. Mauritania abolished slavery in 1981, but activists say it is still very common and that many Mauritanians are born into slavery. Mauritania passed a new anti-slavery law in 2015 that makes slavery a "crime against humanity". 

The editor of Aqlame took down the article, and said it was published by accident.

On January 2, 2014, Mohamed was arrested in his home in the city of Nouadhibou. He was charged with apostasy under Article 306 of the Mauritanian criminal code, and sentenced to death. There were national demonstrations against Mohamed, and there was a fatwa to kill him. His family denounced him. His lawyers dropped him and he could not get another lawyer, only the lawyers assigned by the court. The trial started a day late because of a fight in the courtroom. The prosecuting lawyer said he was a member of the caste that the blogger criticized in his article. Mohamed belongs to a lower social class.

According to Abdel Nasser Beibe, a Mauritanian activist and representative of the Arab Thinking Foundation, there are many people who wrote about the same things as Mohamed, but they belong to the white community, who are the majority of the people, and no one asks for their death. Their tribes and their families defend them against any attack. But Mohamed comes from the "blacksmith" minority, and are very marginalized. After the article, his family and caste had to deny him, and his parents had to go into exile in France. 

Mekfoula Brahim, activist and president of For a Green and Democratic Mauritania says that Mohamed was a victim of a very hard prison sentence because he belongs to a powerless and hated group. Mekfoula says Muhamed's future is being controlled by street fanatics, who receive orders from extremist clerics influenced by radicals who have returned from Afghanistan and Iraq, who press them to execute the boy.

The president of Mauritania, Abdel Aziz spoke to the country in January 2014, saying Mauritanian is an Islamic state and the death penalty could be used against Mohamed. Abdel Aziz ususally wears a business suit and tie in public, and when he speaks with Western allies, like the United States and France. but when he spoke to the nation about Momhamed Ould Mkhaitir, he wore a white Salafi robe and turban.

An appeal court heard the case on April 1, 2016, under tight security. The court upheld the verdict, but sent the case back to Mauritania's supreme court. On Jan. 31, 2017, Mauritania’s supreme court heard the case, and returned it to the appeal court. There were organized demonstrations in Nouadhibou, Aleg, and Rosso.

Goicoechea (canton)

Goicoechea is the 8th canton in the Province of San Jose, Costa Rica, with a population of 115,084 as of 2011. The city of Guadalupe is its main district. It forms part of the broader San José metropolitan area, itself the capital of the Republic.

Goicoechea is located northeast of the capital city of San José. Goicoechea's geographic center is 09°57'31" latitude north and 83º 59'26" longitude west.

The canton is narrowly shaped in width and elongated in length. It is a maximum of 20 kilometers wide in a southeast by northeast direction from the source of the Durazno River to the bridge crossing the Tórres River, along Nacional No. 5 road, that leads from San José to San Juan de Tibás.

It borders:

The canton is named after an illustrious national forefather, Franciscan friar José Antonio de Liendo y Goicoechea who was born in the city of Cartago in the Province of Cartago, Costa Rica, on the 3rd of May, 1735, and died July 2, 1814, in Guatemala.

The area corresponding to the Goicoechea canton during the pre-Columbian period was populated by an indigenous people called the Western Huetar Kingdom, under the rule of king Garabito at the start of the Spanish Conquest.

The first canton dwellers established themselves in what today is called Calle Blancos (White Street), the first street neighborhood in the area. This name was assigned to the area as a result of the many people by the name of Blanco (White) who had taken residence there. The population began to spread eastbound, stretching paths toward what later became known as the canton's center.

In 1828, the main district (known as the Municipality) of San José divided the Murciélago neighborhood into several groups of houses. This gave cause for registering, under the name of San José del Murciélago, what today is known as the , which became a village and eventually on August 6, 1891, according to Law No. 56 during José Joaquín Rodríguez Zeledón's administration, this village was granted township status to head the canton as its main district. Entry for San José del Murciélago was recorded in the Neighborhoods and Quarters Boundary Register at the Department of San José a full 63 years before Guadalupe reached municipality status for the Canton of Goicoechea.

As of November 30, 1841, the Neighborhood and Dwellings Boundary Register's entries for the Los Santos neighborhood, along with the San Francisco, San Ramón, San José, San Rafael and San Joaquín quarters matched what presently corresponds to a large portion of the Goicoechea canton. And in 1844 residents of the San José quarter negotiated a permit to build a hermitage dedicated to their patron St. Joseph. Six years later, the first parson of the area, presbyter Raimundo Mora, changed the patron saint as well as the name of the quarter from San José to Guadalupe, in honor of the Virgin of Guadalupe, being that he was her devotee. He also broke ground for the cemetery, which is one of the oldest works in the city of Guadalupe. In 1855 a began to be built where it is still presently located. The following year a parish was built, during the episcopacy of monsignor Joaquín Anselmo Llorente y Lafuente, Costa Rica's first bishop, and it is currently suffragan of the archdiocese of San José, belonging to the ecclesiastic province of Costa Rica.

The regional demographic and economic development that occurred in Goicoechea resulted from the planting of coffee. It became the dominant product as of 1850, replacing the large tobacco plantations that had constituted the main source of income for the earliest population. The "golden bean" was introduced to Guadalupe in 1840 by José Manuel Núñez, who planted it and established the first processing site at his former wheat mill. Another important factor in regional development was the Camino de Carrillo (Road to Carrillo), located near the confluence of the Sucio and Honduras rivers. The need for this road was due to local coffee farmers' demands to deliver their beans to the Limón harbor on the Atlantic for exportation, thereby shortening the cargo journey to their main European markets. At first the thought was to build a train track from San José, the country's capital, to Limón, moving through Paso de La Palma. Later in 1881, when the road section had reached Carrillo, the national government proposed to discontinue construction to open a road instead from San José to Carrillo. The following year that new road was inaugurated, but was in use for very little time, given its high cost of maintenance and traffic on it becoming sparse, once a train track construction from San José to the Caribbean coast was completed in 1890.

Goicoechea's first elementary school was built in 1883. It is located north of the Goicoechea Park. Afterward Escuela Carlos Gagini was built, and then in 1939 a new grammar school was inaugurated called Escuela Pilar Jiménez Solís, during president León Cortés Castro's administration. The secondary school Liceo Napoleón Quesada began operations in 1955, during president José Figueres Ferrer's first administration.

Guadalupe has been Goicoechea's municipality since 1891. But given its population growth, as of on August 10, 1920, during president Julio Acosta García's administration, Law No. 69 conferred to it the title of city.

Goicoechea was officially drawn away from the canton of San José and established by decree via Law No. 36 on December 7, l848. Law No. 56 decreed on August 6, 1891 that Goicoechea be itself established as a canton in the province of San José with Guadalupe as its municipality. Yet this law did not define any other districts for the canton, though it did recognize 6 townships toward that end.

The first Canton Board Hearing of Goicoechea occurred on September 13, 1891 with representatives Francisco Jiménez Núñez serving as president, Tomás Gutiérrez and Ezequiel Vargas serving as vice presidents. Jesús Zeledón served as secretary and Basileo Araya as political chief.

The first aqueduct and sewage lines were inaugurated in 1910 under president Ricardo Jiménez Oreamuno's administration.

Goicoechea consists of 7 districts:

Geologically, Goicoechea canton is grounded on volcanic matter dating to the Quartenary Period. Rocks from the Pleistocene epoch predominate in the region. Dating to this period, there are rolling structures located between Villa Rancho Redondo and the Purral district. Volcanic structures, recently and presently established, formed during the Holocene epoch. They are associated to pyroclastics and other volcanic matter such as lava, lahars and pyroclasts. The earliest ones are located west of the canton, originating from Villa Rancho Redondo. The later ones originate from Purral and move east.

The Goicoechea canton is part of a geomorphic unit of volcanic origin, which is divided into two sub-units called the Irazú Volcano and the Volcanic Filling of the Central Valley.

The Irazú Volcano sub-unit is located to the east of the canton from Villa Mata de Plátano. It consists of slopes of all kinds. The contours of the hills are rounded due to the thickness of recent ash deposits that cover almost the whole surface mass. The sub-unit is composed of volcanic rocks displaying gaps, lavas, tuffs, agglomerates, ignimbrites, ash and also many streams of mud and lahars. The rocks' degree of weathering is highly variable, with its origin being due to the accumulation of different type of volcanic rocks.

The volcanic filling of the Central Valley, located in the western sector of the canton, corresponds to a flat undulating surface. It is possible that changes on the surface within the area are due to the presence of lava only a few meters below the surface. This constitutes a front. The sub-unit takes surface form from volcanic rocks, mainly lavas, tuffs and ignimbrites covered by ash in varying thickness. The sequence flow of lavas rests on sedimentary rock. The lavas are of the andesitic type. Geomorphologically, this unit is not a valley. Nevertheless, for political, socio-economic reasons and various other kinds of references, it is preferable to continue calling this region the Central Valley. The correct technical name is Tectonic Pit, due to the presence of a fault along the foot of the Central Volcanic Sierra, which is evidenced by the existence of thermo-mineral sources. Also there is an abrupt interruption in the foothills that align with the fault as they descend from the Central Volcanic Sierra mountain range towards the valley. Additionally, there is the presence of an unexplained "volcanism" (Pacacua Formation) that corresponds with or nears the position of the fault.

Elevations above sea level for the urban centers in the districts of Goicoechea canton follow:


The fluvial system of the canton of Goicoechea follows Pacific slope, which belongs to the basin of the Grande de Tárcoles River.

The rivers that drain the region begin with the Purral River, with the Navarro River as its tributary as well as the Mozotal brook. The Purral river is a tributary of the Torres River along with the Cangrejos, Patalillo and Patal brooks, together with the Tiribí, Ipís, Durazno and Barreal streams. These watercourses, except for the Torres River, have their source in the canton, on the western slope of the Cabeza de Vaca Hill, and course east-to-west. The Torres, Tiribí, Durazno, Ipís flows, and the ravines Barreal and Patal serve as cantonal borders. The first borders with San José and Montes de Oca. The second borders with the Cartago province. The rivers Durazno and Ipís along with Vázquez de Coronado and the ravines, respectively border with the cantons of Moravia and Montes de Oca.

The canton's maximum width is 12.43 miles (20 km), spreading northeast to southwest from the source of the Durazno River to the bridge over the Torres River, along National Highway No.5, which runs from San José to San Juan de Tibás.


Goicoechea is home to important institutions of various kinds, both governmental and private, as well as a series of industries of great recognition, established mainly in the Calle Blancos industrial zone. Worthy to be noted are:


The canton of Goicoechea has been characterized for being an area of important industrial and commercial development in the province of San José, Costa Rica's capital. An example of its importance may best be seen in that companies such as Motorola and Durman Esquivel remained located in the district of Calle Blancos along with Coca Cola-FEMSA bottling corporation for decades. The construction of the industrial complex Parque Empresarial del Este in the same district has added multinational accounts, namely Amazon, Bank of America, Teletech, among others to this list of growing companies that have increased the rate of employment in the area, while the infrastructure, especially roads, has remained unchanged, leading to excessive congestion.

British Association for Applied Linguistics

The British Association for Applied Linguistics (BAAL) is an academic society. Members are professional applied linguists, language teachers, and other people interested in these topics. BAAL is in the United Kingdom. BAAL has more than 800 members. They meet at different places in the UK. The association publishes conference proceedings and a regular newsletter. It also gives scholarships to students. Tess Fitzpatrick, Professor of Applied Linguistics in the Centre for Language and Communication Research at Cardiff University, is the chair from 2015-2018.

BAAL's Annual Meeting happens every September in the UK. BAAL is part of the "Association Internationale de Linguistique Appliquee" (International Association of Applied Linguistics, AILA). In the UK, it is a registered charity. BAAL meetings usually have a theme.The theme of the 40th conference at the University of Edinburgh was 'Technology, Ideology and Practice in Applied Linguistics'.

The association started in the 1960s. At that time, more people were becoming interested in the new science of modern linguistics and they were especially interested in practical results. One important area of applied linguistics is language teaching and learning. Also at this time, the European Union was becoming more important, so people in Europe needed better language teaching.

Peter Strevens, the Chair in Applied Linguistics at the University of Essex first had the idea to start BAAL. At a meeting at Birkbeck College in July 1965, the original idea for BAAL was to study mainly language teaching and machine translation. However, at the first full meeting in 1967 in Reading, Berkshire the group decided to study many different topics. BAAL became the UK member of AILA, and Pit Corder was its first Chair. At first, membership was only for academics because BAAL wanted people to think it was a group of experts, not a teachers' meeting. However, by the early 1970s it became easier to join BAAL. Since 1985, anyone can join. There are no requirements to become a member. In 1980, the Association began to publish a journal called, "Applied Linguistics".

Stewart was called a "radical-leftist American lawyer" by The New York Times.

Stewart was born in Brooklyn, New York. She was raised in Queens, New York. She studied at Wagner College and at Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey.

Stewart was convicted on charges of conspiracy and providing material support to terrorists in 2005, and sentenced to 28 months in prison. Her felony conviction led to her being automatically disbarred. She was convicted of helping pass messages from her client, Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, an Egyptian cleric convicted of planning terror attacks, to his followers in al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, an organization designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United States Secretary of State.

She was re-sentenced on July 15, 2010, to 10 years in prison in light of her perjury at trial. She served her sentence at the Federal Medical Center, Carswell, a federal prison in Fort Worth, Texas.

Stewart was released from prison on December 31, 2013 on a compassionate release order because of her terminal breast cancer diagnosis.

Stewart died at her home in Brooklyn, New York from a stroke and complications of breast cancer, aged 77.

Paper towel

Paper towels (or kitchen paper) is an absorbent tissue made from paper instead of cloth. Unlike cloth towels, paper towels are disposable and thrown away after use. They soak up water because they are loosely woven. This lets water travel into the paper by capillary action. The water sticks to the fibers by adhesion.

In 2020, scientists from the University of Leeds performed an experiment that showed that people who dried their hands with paper towels removed more viruses than people who dried their hands with jet air dryers. The study was performed in a hospital bathroom.

Virtual DOS machine

A Virtual DOS machine (VDM) permits the users of computers to run 16-bit or 32-bit DOS and 16-bit Windows programs on 32-bit computers when there already is a different operating system using the hardware.

Virtual DOS machines normally use the virtual 8086 mode of the Intel 80386 (or later) processor, allowing many 8086 applications to function by translating operating system commands to make applications think that they are running on an 8086. The operating system can then emulate the DOS software. VDMs like Windows 3.x 386 Enhanced Mode can add support for using 16-/32-bit protected mode software if they use the DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI). If a DOS program in a VDM needs to use a peripheral, Windows will give the DOS program a virtual device driver (VDD) which emulates the hardware using commands that the operating system it is running on can understand.

DOS VDMs appeared on Windows/386 2.01 in 1987 and were also in Windows 3.x, if you were using 386 Enhanced Mode as well as in 95, 98, 98 SE and Me.

Similar to Windows 3.x, VDMs can let you run many DOS applications at one time if you use the EMM386 /MULTI option. Digital Research / Novell was working on a similar system since 1991 under the codename "Vladivar" (originally a device driver KRNL386.SYS and not part of EMM386). It was made for the next version of DR DOS, released as Novell DOS 7 in 1994, but it was also used in their "Star Trek" project, which they stopped working on before finishing.

VDMs called MVDM (Multiple Virtual DOS Machine) are used in OS/2 2.0 and later. OS/2 MVDMs are better than NTVDM in many ways, for example with block devices. While the OS/2 1.x emulated DOS 3.0, 2.x emulated DOS 5.0.

Running Windows 3.1 applications in OS/2 looks similar to XP Mode in Windows 7, but the technologies used are very different. A "guest" VDM permits programs to use the disks of the OS/2 or NT operating system that is running the VDM. Applications in a VDM can use named pipes to talk to their "host".

NTVDM is included in all x86 versions of Windows made on NT, and let 16-bit Windows and 16-/32-bit DOS applications run. It is not included with 64-bit versions (see Limitations). ntvdm.exe helps emulate the APIs needed to run 16-bit DOS and Windows applications.

NTVDM uses NTIO.SYS and NTDOS.SYS, which runs a changed version of COMMAND.COM. The 16-bit system files are smaller versions of their MS-DOS 5.0 counterparts, including IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS and COMMAND.COM, which remove biases with the FAT file system and can also call the 32-bit NTVDM if needed. NTDOS originally gave a DOS version of 30.00 to programs, but this soon was changed to 5.00 to let more programs to run without being changed However, there are many newer MS-DOS functions and commands added to MS-DOS versions 6.x and in Windows 9x which are not there.

16-bit programs run separately within one 32-bit NTVDM process. Checking "Run in separate memory space" in the "Run" dialog box or shortcut of the program creates a new process instead. NTVDM emulates BIOS functions, the Windows 3.1 kernel, and its 16-bit API.

32-bit DOS emulation is used for DPMI and using 32-bit memory. wowexec.exe is the emulator process for 16-bit Windows. Windows 2000 added Sound Blaster 2.0 emulation to 32-bit NTVDM. 16-bit and DOS virtual device drivers can't be run. Win16 programs can communicate with other parts of Windows using OLE, DDE and named pipes.

As virtual 8086 mode isn't available on non-x86 processors, NTVDM was a full emulator for NT on these architectures. NT 3.51 could only 80286, but since NT 4.0, 486 emulation was added.

In January 2010, Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy discovered a large security problem in NTVDM system letting non-Administrators to increase their permissions to the SYSTEM level. Ormandy claimed it was a problem for all x86 versions of Windows NT after 1993. 32-bit versions of NT 3.X/4.0, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 2008, and 7 were affected. Ormandy published how the problem works. Before Microsoft could fix it, you could turn off 16-bit application support to solve the problem, but it made so you could not run 16-bit programs. x64 Windows never had this problem because it doesn't use NTVDM. After applying the security fixes Microsoft made available, NTVDM could be turned on safely.

NTVDM and wowexec had limitations on Windows XP and later because of a GDI object limit per session, which might cause GDI handles to be moved two bits to the right when changing 32 to 16 bits. Handles thus could not be larger than 14 bits, so 16-bit programs with a GDI handle larger than 16384 would crash.

On x86-64 CPUs, virtual 8086 mode is only available as a legacy sub-mode (if running a 32-bit operating system), but not in 64-bit long mode, which is why NTVDM is not included with 64-bit versions of Windows, so 16-bit applications cannot be run on 64-bit Windows. You'll need Windows XP Mode or similar virtualization software to run 16-bit programs within a 64-bit operating system.

NTVDM cannot run DOS games on computers of today. Emulation is only provided for simple peripherals. For example, sound in NTVDM can be limited. Windows NT only updates the screen a few times per second when DOS programs write on it, and they can't emulate high-resolution graphics options. As software runs at the speed of the CPU, all "timing loops" stop too early. This either makes games run too fast, or causes the software to not see some emulated hardware peripherals, because it can not wait that long for an answer.



Imambara Zadibal

Imambara Zadibal was the first Imambara constructed in Kashmir Valley by Kaji Chak, minister in the regime of Sultan Mohammad in the year 1518. This Imambara was burned down and destroyed number of times.

One of the most ancient monuments of Kashmir, Imambara Zadibal is in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, administered by India. It lies in the Zadibal area within Srinagar to the west side of the fort. Built in 1518, this shrine was erected by Kaji Chak, who was a minister with Sultan Mohammed Shah. This two-storey building is one of the oldest historic places in Kashmir valley. Sitting on the lines of Persian architecture, this shrine looks old and it is a popular tourist spot. From 1548 AD to 1872 AD, the building was set on fire eleven times and it was rebuilt each time. Recently, the ancient Imambara was taken down in 2004 to restructure and rebuild the shrine that stands today. The shrine is large enough to hold more than 32,000 visitors at a time.

There are different stories about the construction of the Imambara Zadibal, but the history says Tajik Shah donated the land of the zadibal to Mir Shamshud din Iraqi, who introduced Shia Islam to Kashmir and influenced the government officials of that time. 

Then the family of Mir Shamshud din Iraqi, whose mausoleum is only few feet away from the Imambara Zadibal, lived in the place. The fifth generation of his family built their private mosque and lived nearby well into the early twenty-first century. They set aside productive land to generate money for the upkeep of the mosque. They kept the rights of ownership to themselves but allowed their neighbors to pray there. 

It became the main center of learning for the followers of Ahlul bait. The elders of Markdar families would teach about religion. They also built a Hamam to use as a guest house for travelers coming from Baltistan and other distant areas. During time of Maharaja Ghulab Singh who wanted to keep all the centers under the control of his rule through his representatives (Jalalis) so that no one could revolt against him. Then a dispute broke out between Jalalis and Markdars. It went on for 150 years. 

At the time of prime minister of Kashmir Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad, the Markdars donated the Imambara to the Shia public and later on its guardianship was taken by Shia Association. The Shia Association procured the land around the Imambara from the Markdars through several different deals, including language exchanges and cash payments. Recently, the Imambara was repaired by the late Molvi Iftikhar Hussein Ansari.

Inspired by the Persian style of architecture, Imambara Zadibal is a two-storey building. It is made out of oriental bricks. Its Maharaji bricks cover an area of over 75 square meters. This shrine has various sideways floor raisings called Gulam Gardish. There is a central ground level floor called Pokhr. It also has a large gallery with four gates.

Currently, the structure is under the supervision of All Jammu and Kashmir Shia Association, who maintain it. The structure that we see today is still undergoing construction work.

Shia Muslims are a minority in Kashmir. During the first 10 days of Muharram, Imambada Zadibal becomes a centre of mourning and religious gathering in Zadibal. Shia followers join in the mourning, usually ending on the day of Ashura, when a large procession parades through the streets of Zadibal ending at Imambada Zadibal. Mourning continues from first day of Muharram to eighth of the Islamic month Rabi al Awwal, after which Eid al Zahra, also known as Eid e Shuja, is celebrated. This marks the end of the two-month mourning period.

Imambara Zadibal has been destroyed and rebuilt many times. From the period of Sultan Nazuk Shah by Mirza Douglat in 1548 AD to the reign of Maharaja Ranbir Singh in 1872 AD, this shrine was burnt down around eleven times.

At the time Imambara Zadibal was constructed, it was a majestic building and people in the Kashmir Valley were proud of it. However, Mirza Hyder Kashgari Douglat set this shrine on fire in 1548 AD. Daulat Chak began rebuilding it in 1551.

Zafar Kupawari set Imambara Zadibal on fire for the second time in 1553. It was burned down again in 1653 by enemies of Ahlul Bayt during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan.

In 1682 AD, when Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir ruled, Imambara Zadibal was set on fire again. In 1719 AD, it was burned down for the fifth time during the Mukhtawi Khan clash. It caught fire for the sixth time in 1748 AD by enemies of Ahlul Bayt. They did so again in 1763. Imambara Zadibal caught fire again in June 1801, during Afghan rule in Kashmir, just before Ashura. 

In July 1830, the shrine was the site of a massacre when Jammu and Kashmir were under Sikh rule. This same day, many Shias were cruelly murdered. This happened at Ali Park in Zadibal or Margibal.

Imambara Zadibal was rebuilt with the financial help sent by Nawab Hakim Mehndi Ali Khan , the prime minister of Awadh's King Nasir-ud-din Haider. This grant was sent to Haji Baqir Khan Irani, who passed on the duty of rebuilding this structure to Hatim Mir.

In September 1872, the building was again set ablaze under the rule of Maharaja Ranbir Singh. He was a Dogra Ruler of J&K. This time, the king gave considerable financial aid of about Rs. 3 lakhs to renovate the Imambara and restore it to its current prosperous condition. Every time the shrine went through fire, followers of Prophet Mohammad and Ahlul Bayt were only more convinced to make it whole again.

Reaching this shrine is easy because it is close to Srinagar Highway. The Imambara is in the middle of Zadibal, and it is near the Khushal Sar Lake and Hari Parbat Fort that most people call Qilla. The nearest railway station is the Srinagar railway station. It is an hour's ride away by car. Sheikh ul Alam International Airport is only a few kilometers from the Imambara. Taxi services are also available within the city of Srinagar.


Windows on Windows

With computers, Windows on Windows (often shortened to WOW,) is a compatibility layer of x86 versions of the Microsoft Windows NT family of operating systems that allows many legacy 16-bit programs run that were made for Windows 3.x or before to run.

WOW allows many 16-bit Windows programs to run without changes on newer 32-bit versions of Windows. This was made to give software developers time to make their software 32-bit while people moved from Windows 3.1x to Windows 95, so the OS can be upgraded to a newer version while running most, or all of, a customer's 16-bit programs.

Windows 9x operating systems, which were made on top of DOS, had both 16 and 32-bit systems, so if it kept those 16-bit parts, the OS could run 16-bit software without emulation. NT-based versions are very different in how they run, so they need a more sophisticated solution. There are two main techniques to let 16-bit programs run on 32-bit versions of Windows (with some limitations) called thunking and shimming.

WOW "thunks" 16-bit instructions into 32-bit equivalents to permit 16-bit pointers, memory spaces, and address spaces.

16-bit programs usually run in a single virtual DOS machine, sharing memory between them. However, they can be changed to run in a private, separate memory space, where every 16-bit process has a separate process. This can reduce system crashes by not letting programs interfere with others, but it can cause reduced 16-bit inter-process communication and can use more of your computer's memory.

WOW is a part of 32-bit editions of Windows NT. 64-bit versions of Windows (including Windows Server 2008 R2 and later where they only have 64-bit versions) can not run 16-bit software without using different emulation software (for example, DOSBox).

WOWEXEC.EXE on Windows NT allows WoW to work. Windows-on-Windows can, using the WIN.COM file, emulate the Windows 3.x (for NTVDM), Windows 95 and Windows 98 kernels, which can run 16-bit DOS-powered Windows applications on Windows NT.

Problems with applications running on newer operating systems, especially with long filenames, multiple user accounts, and least privilege, may prohibit some applications from working correctly. For example, they might incorrectly think that they can write files to any part of the file system, but NTFS file permissions exist and does not allow this in many system folders. When Microsoft was building Windows 95, they had to ensure old programs still worked with 8.3 filenames to allow old applications to keep working properly. Since Windows 95, there was a feature where both a long and short file name are kept, so older applications could still use the 8.3 filenames.

Programs that try to access hardware directly can't do so. Old programs may also not work if they expect certain system configuration files from DOS and Windows 9x that are not used in Windows NT operating systems, so empty versions of files like AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS exist even though Windows NT does not use them.

Many shims exist in the application compatibility layer of later versions of Windows to capture and change API calls from old applications made with different assumptions about the operating system in mind.



Duenos inscription

The duenos inscription is a Latin text found on a piece of pottery in Rome. The pottery was dated to the sixth century BC. The text is among the oldest known texts of old Latin. It is difficult to read because the words are not separated by spaces.

Since the pottery, or "kernos", was found in 1880, many translations have been proposed. By 1983, more than fifty different explanations of the meaning had been put forward. Due to the lack of a large body of archaic Latin, and the method by which Romans abbreviated their inscriptions, scholars have not been able to produce a singular translation that has been accepted by historians as accurate. However thanks to Arthur E. Gordon's work the reading of the text can be now considered certain.

Below is the transcription and one of many possible interpretations:

An interpretation set out by Warmington and Eichner, renders the complete translation as follows, though not with certainty:

Syria Direct

Syria Direct is a not-for-profit news organization based in Jordan. It was started in 2013 by television news producer Amjad Tadros and the Global Peace and Development Charitable Trust. "Syria Direct" reports on the conflict in neighboring Syria, because reporting from Syria is either restricted or too dangerous.

"Syria Direct" publishes news reports, interviews, photographs, and videos from inside Syria. They also publish a newsletter. They do not accept advertising. Their operations are funded by the Global Peace & Development Charitable Trust.

"Syria Direct" is published in English and Arabic. The articles are for readers who are already 
knowledgeable about Syria but want more detailed information. "Syria Direct" employs about 24 Syrians and Americans who talk to Syrian activists and civilians on both sides of the conflict every day by Skype. Syrian journalists write the stories in Arabic. The stories are translated to English, fact-checked and edited, then translated back to Arabic. Their website receives about 50,000 page views every month. Their Facebook page has 77,000 followers. Thousands of people follow their Twitter account. 

"Syria Direct" also has a training program for journalists from Syria. In the past, the training program has received funding from the US Embassy Amman's Public Affairs Section, the Syria office of the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung organization, and the Canadian Embassy in Amman. Every six months they train twelve new Syrian journalists. The trainees' stories have been published in USA Today, CNN.com, Radio Free Europe, and international new organizations like Le Monde and The Toronto Globe and Mail. As of September 2016, they had trained 70 new journalists.


Dunn index

The Dunn Index (DI) is a metric for judging a clustering algorithm. A higher DI implies better clustering. It assumes that better clustering means that clusters are compact and well-separated from other clusters.

There are many ways to define the size of a cluster and distance between clusters.

The DI is equal to the minimum inter-cluster distance divided by the maximum cluster size. Note that larger inter-cluster distances (better separation) and smaller cluster sizes (more compact clusters) lead to a higher DI value.

In mathematical terms:

Let the size of cluster C be denoted by: formula_1

Let the distance between clusters i and j be denoted by: formula_2

Tennis court

A tennis court is a court used to play tennis. It is a rectangle with a net across the middle. During a tennis match there can be both one player (single) or two players (double) on both half. The surface can be grass, clay or hardcourt.

The dimensions are set as the standard for lawn tennis by the International Tennis Federation and written down in the 'Rules of Tennis' document. The Tennis court is 78 feet (23.77 meters) long. Its width is 27 feet (8.23 meters) for singles matches and 36 feet (10.97 meters) for doubles matches. The service line is 21 feet (6.40 meters) from the net.

Clay Court is primarily made with stone, brick and crushed shale. The tennis ball on the clay court has the interesting feature of digging into the dirt. The clay court is the cheapest court to construct but is also is the court that requires the most maintenance. The water content should be balanced and the courts have to be rolled often to maintain flattened form. 

Grass Courts are the fastest courts. Before the open era most games were played in grass courts. Over time, the maintenance and cost have made it less popular. Grass courts are made by growing grass in hard packed soil. This can create many micro-variations in the surface type.

Carpet Courts are rollable court surfaces. They are characterized by their low bounce and fast surface compared to hard courts. Carpet courts went out of fashion in the late 20th century and have been discontinued from the world tour.

Hard Courts are by far the most popular surfaces, primarily due to the one-time investment and minimum maintenance. The courts are made up of uniform rigid material, often covered with an acrylic surface layer to offer greater consistency of bounce than other outdoor surfaces. Hard courts generally vary in speed, being slower than grass courts but faster than clay.

Artificial leather

Artificial leather is a substance used as a replacement for real leather. It is used where the properties or the look of real leather are desired, but real leather is too expensive, unsuitable, or not feasible for ethical reasons. Compared with real leather, artificial leathers are much cheaper to produce. Water resistance is another advantage of many artificial leathers. They are often used for upholstery and fashion and other purposes.

Usually, there are two components: A kind of textile, and some kind of plastic (such as PVC). Real leather is produced from the skin of animals.

Artificial leather might look like it is better for the environment, since no animals need to be killed to make it. The problem with artificial leather is different: When the item of clothing is no longer used, it is thrown away. Many plastics take a long time to decay. That way, the plastic part may get into the sea, where animals such as birds and fish eat it. The chemicals used to make artificial leather are toxic, and can lead to pollution.

Prunus virginiana

Chokecherries ("Prunus virginiana"), also known as the bitter-berry, Virginia bird cherry, and western chokecherry, are shrubs or small trees that are native to The United States, Canada, and some parts of Mexico. They grow to be around 4.9 m (16 ft 1 in).

Chokecherry classifies as a suckering shrub or a tree. They grow quite tall, around 1 – 6 meters.

Their leaves are oval with coarse, sharp edges. The flowers grow about 38.1–76.2 cm (15–30 in) long in late spring (well after chokecherry leaves appear).

The fruits are about 1 cm (3⁄8 in) across. They range in color from bright red to black. They have a very astringent taste, both somewhat sour and somewhat bitter. The fruits are sweetest when they are very ripe "berries" (actually drupes). These are dark in color.

Chokecherries are very high in antioxidants, sharing this trait with chokeberries. This does contribute to confusion between the two. The wild chokeberry is often considered a weed, since it hosts the tent caterpillar. This caterpillar eats tree leaves, robbing trees of energy and heightening the chance that they die. Often people enjoy the cultivars of the plant, such as "Canada Red" and "Schubert". Both have purple leaves when mature and "Goertz", another cultivar, has a palatable taste in it's fruit. The chokecherry is closely related to the well-known black cherry of eastern North America. The name "chokecherry" is also used for the related Manchurian cherry, or Amur chokeberry.

For many Native American tribes, chokecherries are very important and are part of pemmican, an Indian staple food. The bark of the root is used to ward off or treat colds, fevers and stomach maladies by Indians. It's also used in a ceremonial smoking mix known as kinnikinnick. The chokecherry fruit can be eaten when fully ripe, but if not, the fruit contains a toxin. It can also be used to make jam or syrup, with the use of sugar. The Plains Indians pound up the whole fruit in a mortar, from which they make cakes.

The stone of the fruit is poisonous. Chokecherry is toxic to most animals with segmented stomachs, especially after the leaves have wilted. This action produces cyanide, which is very toxic to most living things. It also makes the plant sweet, making farmer's lives harder by keeping their cows away from it. However, birds and game animals eat the berries when they're ripe. It's also used to craft wine in the Western United States.

The plant hosts many types of moths and butterflies.

Symsyn

Symsyn is a simple syntax programming language and real time multitasking runtime environment.

Named for its SIMple SYNtax, Symsyn is based on Free Pascal, which is based on Pascal, developed by Niklaus Wirth and named in honor of the French mathematician, philosopher and physicist Blaise Pascal.

Symsyn has a simple syntax and short learning curve. It provides access to functionality found in more sophisticated languages, such as the free version of the Pascal programming language, Free Pascal. The language's primitives, or basics, are Pascal procedures which, in some cases, access the Free Pascal Run Time Library.

These primitives provide the normal testing, arithmetic, move, and string handling capabilities as well as the following additions:

It is extensible, in that it can be extended. Algorithms can be added to the collection of primitives. Many programs can be written in SymSyn. Like most programming languages, SymSyn can say hello to the world.

That is to say there are no turning points but there may be stationary points where the gradient is momentarily zero. The derivative function of a monotonic function which describes its gradient will never change sign. 

Destroyer

A destroyer is a fast, small, and maneuverable warship. Destroyers escort larger warships. Destroyers were first used in the late 1800s to defend against torpedo boats.

Ultraviolet catastrophe

The ultraviolet catastrophe is the name given to a conflict between theory and the observation in classical physics. 

An ideal blackbody at thermal equilibrium emits radiation in all frequency ranges. It emits more energy as the frequency increases. By calculating the total amount of radiated energy, it can be shown that a blackbody would release an infinite amount of energy. This contradicted the principles of conservation of energy and showed a new model was needed for the behaviour of blackbodies. 

This happened around the end of the nineteenth century. It was one of the things that led to the invention of quantum mechanics. Theorists like Max Planck solved the problem with the quantum theory in which energy leaves the body in distinct packets called quanta rather than in continuous waves. The quantum theory accurately predicted the energy of the radiation that is observed.

English claims to the French throne

From 1340-1800 many English and later British monarchs claimed the throne of France. The origin of the claims come from Edward III's territorial claims of France which he claimed gave him the right to be king. He tried to take the throne of France and started the Hundred Years' War.

 The first English monarch to completely rule France for majority of his reign.
Henry VI was made to be successor of French king Charles VI and on October 21st 1422 took up the position of the French king. He was said to rule the whole of France but in reality only ruled small parts of the north. Charles VII was later crowned as king of France, son of Charles VI starting a small line of disputed monarchs and the English, later British monarch claiming the throne of France for another 350 years.
Edward IV also claimed the throne of France during Henry VI's absence from the English throne and his claims happened in between Henry's so reign of the monarch may not be in perfect order for this list. The claim was of France but really monarchs only ruled Calais due to the terrible general skills of the Duke of Somerset, a close friend of Margaret of Anjou and Henry VI.
Phillip II of Spain/Phillip I of England who ruled with Mary did claim Calais and partially rule it but he is considered a co-king of the Tudor dynasty and will not be counted as a legitimate Calais ruler or English king and more of a co-king/consort.

English and Scottish claims refer to claims made after the 1603 union between the English monarch and the Scottish monarch when Scottish king James VI became English king James I uniting the kingdoms under one king. However they remained geo-politically separate until the 1707 Acts of Union which united Scotland and England (including the Principality of Wales) into one nation now named Great Britain as of 1707, later the United Kingdom in 1800, the year George III dropped his claim.

He was chosen as king after the death of Margaret, Maid of Norway. Although he was never considered to be the true king as he was an ally with Edward Longshanks and Edward II, kings of England.

Tern

Terns are seabirds in the family Laridae. They are normally found near the sea, rivers, or wetlands. 

They are slender, lightly built birds with long, forked tails, narrow wings, long bills, and short legs. Most species are pale grey above and white below, with a contrasting black cap to the head, but some have dark plumage for part of the year. 

Terns breed in noisy colonies and lay their eggs on bare ground with little or no nest material. Marsh terns make floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats, and a few species build simple nests in trees, on cliffs or in crevices. 

Most species feed on fish caught by diving from flight, but the marsh terns are insect-eaters, and some large terns may take small land vertebrates. Many terns are long-distance migrants, and the Arctic tern may see more daylight in a year than any other animal.

Ontological argument

The ontological argument is an idea in religious philosophy. It is supposed to show that God exists.

There are different versions, but they all argue something like: because we can imagine a perfect being, there must be a god. The idea is that existing makes a good thing better than one that's only imaginary. So the perfect thing we're imagining must exist. Then we call the perfect thing God. The earliest objection was that an argument like that could prove wrong things. You could prove that a perfect island must exist, for example. But no real island is perfect.

Because it starts with imagination, not what you can see or experience, this is a kind of "a priori" reasoning. David Hume didn't like that way of thinking. He believed that knowledge had to come from experience and called everything else "nothing but sophistry and illusion".

Other versions of the argument start with the idea of the universe, and from that argue that there must be a god.

Gas operation (firearms)

Gas-operation is a system of operation used to provide energy to operate autoloading firearms. In gas operation, a portion of high-pressure gas from the cartridge being fired is used to power a mechanism to extract the spent case and insert a new cartridge into the chamber. Energy from the gas is harnessed through either a port in the barrel or a trap at the muzzle. This high-pressure gas impinges on a surface such as a piston head to provide motion for unlocking of the action, extraction of the spent case, ejection, cocking of the hammer or striker, chambering of a fresh cartridge, and locking of the action.

The AK-47 is the most-produced rifle using long stroke gas operation.

Used in the AR-18.

Direct impingement is a form of gas operation that does away with the piston completely. The bolt is designed in such a way so that the gas acts directly upon the bolt (hence the name) to cycle the action. Used in the AR-15.

Another form of direct impingement using a fluted chamber instead of a gas port. With this operation, the gas circumvents around the chambered cartridge through the grooves of the fluted chamber surpassing through the locking lugs to the front of the bolt carrier that operates as a gas piston unlocking the bolt to cycle the weapons operation.

Early machine guns were expensive to operate. The United States Army wanted to train machine gun crews with less-expensive ammunition. To do this, they needed the .22 LR cartridge to operate firearms designed to use the .30-06 cartridge. David Marshall Williams invented a method that involved a separate floating chamber that acted as a gas piston with combustion gas impinging directly on the front of the floating chamber. The .22 caliber Colt Service Ace conversion kit for the .45 caliber M1911 pistol also used Williams' system, which allows a much heavier slide than other conversions operating on the unaugmented blowback mechanism and makes training with the converted pistol realistic. A floating chamber provides additional force to operate the heavier slide, providing a felt recoil level similar to that of a full power cartridge.

The bolt is not locked but is pushed rearward by the expanding propellant gases as in other blowback-based designs. However, propellant gases are vented from the barrel into a cylinder with a piston that delays the opening of the bolt. It is used by Volkssturmgewehr 1-5 rifle, the Heckler & Koch P7, Steyr GB and Walther CCP pistols.


FN Herstal

Fabrique Nationale de Herstal, also called Fabrique Nationale or FN, is a Belgian company that makes firearms. The company often market themselves under the name FN Herstal.

The company was founded in 1990 by Leopold II. It is based in Herstal, Liège, Belgium].

Henri Emmanuelli

He served as President of the French National Assembly from 22 January 1992 through 1 April 1993. He later served as First Secretary of the French Socialist Party from 19 June 1994 through 14 October 1995.

Emmanuelli was a strong supporter of French president François Mitterrand during his political career despite being a Socialist.

Emmanuelli died on 21 March 2017 at a medical center in Bayonne, Pyrénées-Atlantiques from complications of acute bronchitis at the age of 71.


USAS-12

The USAS-12 (Universal Sports Automatic Shotgun 12-gauge) is a fully automatic gas operated shotgun made by the South Korean-based company Daewoo.

The USAS-12 is a gas-operated, select-fire weapon which is designed to provide sustained firepower in close quarter combat scenarios. It accepts detachable 10-round box magazines or 20-round drum magazines. Both types of magazine are made of polymer, and drum magazines have their rear side made from translucent polymer to tell of the number of shot shells left. It has an effective range of 40 m.


Pancor Jackhammer

The Pancor Jackhammer is a fully automatic, rotary magazine, 12 gauge shotgun. Designed in 1984 by John Anderson, and patented in 1987. The concept of a fully automatic shotgun has not taken hold with the military, or with law enforcement, due to the difficulty of controlling such a weapon. Only three prototypes were constructed, with two of the three exploding during testing; only one survives today, in the hands of a private collector. However, the shotgun's futuristic appearance has made it popular in action movies and video games.

Amyloidosis

Amyloidosis is a rare and serious disease that could be fatal that is caused by accumulation of proteins in the form of abnormal, insoluble fibres, known as amyloid fibrils, within the tissues of the body. 

Amyloid deposits can be confined to only one part of the body or a single organ system in 'local amyloidosis' or they can be widely distributed in organs and tissues throughout the body in 'systemic amyloidosis'. The symptoms of amyloidosis are accordingly highly variable and confirmation of the presence of amyloid in the tissues can be challenging, so that diagnosis is often delayed.

There are many different types of amyloidosis, each caused by formation of amyloid fibrils from different soluble precursor proteins in different patients. About 30 different proteins are known to form amyloid fibrils in humans and amyloidosis is named and classified according to the identity of the respective fibril protein. 

Though this disease being rare, many famous people have died from this disease such as: Martin McGuinness, David Lange, Robert Jordan and Robert P. Casey.


Open bolt

A semi or fully automatic firearm is said to fire from an open bolt if, when ready to fire, the bolt and working parts are held to the rear. When the trigger is pulled the bolt goes forward, feeding a round from the magazine (or belt) into the chamber and firing it. Like any other self-loading design without an external power supply, the action is cycled by the energy of the shot; this sends the bolt back to the rear, ejecting the empty cartridge case and preparing for the next shot (or continuing forward again, if the trigger is held down and the weapon is an automatic). Generally, an open-bolt firing cycle is used for fully automatic weapons and not for semi-automatic weapons (except some semi-automatic conversions of automatic designs). Firearms using Advanced Primer Ignition blowback inherently fire from open bolt only.

Owen submachine gun

The Owen gun was an Australian 9mm submachine gun used in World War II. It was used by Australian soldiers who favoured it in jungle combat. Although used predominantly in the far east, it was considered the best submachine gun of WW2 as it was simple, rugged, had an ergonomic layout and had a compensator to increase accuracy when firing.

Leader Dynamics T2MK5

The Leader T2 MK5 Series weapons were designed to fit the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge. They were manufactured by Leader Dynamics of Smithfield, NSW, Australia (1978-1982/1983). The Leader was designed by Charles St. George. It was originally a contender for a 5.56 mm Australian military service rifle to replace the Lithgow L1A1-F1 SLR and Colt M16A1 rifles. What was unique about this was that Australia had never designed or manufactured its own commercial gas-operated semi-automatic rifle. The rifle was abandoned when the Steyr AUG was adopted for use by the Australian military.

The T2 used a triangular bolt-face that was similar to the Winchester Model 100. This was adopted because the original bolt-face was too complex and expensive to manufacture. Barrett Firearms uses a similar design for the M82A1 and its bolt action guns. St. George worked for Barrett at around this time but was not involved in design or engineering duties.

Edith Thompson and Frederick Bywaters

Edith Jessie Thompson (25 December 1893 – 9 January 1923) and Frederick Edward Francis Bywaters (27 June 1902 – 9 January 1923) were a British couple executed for the murder of Thompson's husband Percy. Their case became a "cause célèbre".

2017 Westminster attack

The 2017 Westminster attack was a terrorist attack which happened on 22 March in London, England. The attack took place on Westminster Bridge, in Parliament Square and within the grounds of the Palace of Westminster.

A Hyundai vehicle was driven into a crowd of people near the palace gates, and the attacker stabbed a police officer, who later died due to his injuries. Five people—including pedestrians on the bridge, the stabbed police officer and the attacker—were confirmed dead.

It was the first and largest major attack to occur in London since the 7 July 2005 London bombings. The motivation was suspected to be linked to Islamic terrorism.

The attacker was identified by the Metropolitan Police as 52-year-old Briton Khalid Masood. Born Adrian Russell Elms, possibly later changed to Adrian Russell Ajao.

Local media report that in 2009 he underwent 
conversion to Islam while in prison, after which he changed his name to Khalid Masood. Police said he also used several other aliases, including Khalid Choudry. Masood was born in Kent and detectives believe he was most recently living in the West Midlands. Masood was reported to have been an English teacher or tutor in Saudi Arabia sometime between 2005 and 2009. Then he returned to the United Kingdom and worked as a teacher of English as a second language in Luton.

Masood had been previously investigated by MI5, but Scotland Yard said that he was not the subject of any current investigations. There was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack. He had a range of previous convictions for assaults, including grievous bodily harm, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences going back to 1983. He had not been convicted of any terrorism offences. Pictures of Masood being treated by medics were shown by some news outlets.

Pennsylvania Station (New York City)

Pennsylvania Station (also called Penn Station) is a large train station in New York City. It is the busiest train station in the United States with over 600 thousand people using it every day, many of which are commuters travelling to and from work or school. The station is in Midtown Manhattan and is underneath Madison Square Garden, between Seventh Avenue and Eighth Avenue and between 31st Street and 34th Street.

The station was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad and is one of several stations in the U.S. with this name. Until the beginning of the 20th century, there were no trains that went directly into New York City from the west, because of the Hudson River in the way. People had to get off trains in Jersey City, New Jersey and take a ferry to cross the river and reach New York City.

This all changed when the Pennsylvania Railroad dug two tunnels under the Hudson River, and four under the East River to Queens. The tunnels and the new station in the heart of New York City were completed in 1910 at a cost of $114 million (which is about $2.7 billion today), and the first train ran in November of that year.

Over the years, more railroad companies began to use Penn Station. During World War II, over 100 million people used the station every year. But as air travel began to rise and the Interstate Highway System was created, fewer and fewer people used the train. In 1963, the station was demolished despite protests, and a new one was built in its place, with Penn Plaza and Madison Square Garden built over it. The station reopened in 1968 and continues to be used today.

Penn Station is completely underground, and all trains that run through it have to use electric power from either overhead lines or third rail because the station and the tunnels to it cannot handle exhaust from diesel fuel. There are 21 tracks that run through the station and 11 platforms. Up to 1,200 trains pass through the station every day.

The station is owned by Amtrak, which provides many trains to many cities across the U.S. They include long-distance services that go as far as Chicago, New Orleans, and Miami. From those cities, people can change for trains all the way to cities on the Pacific Coast like Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Diego. Amtrak also has high-speed trains (Acela Express) that go to Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.

There are two commuter rail services that use Penn Station. One of them is the Long Island Rail Road operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which goes to many places on Long Island to the east. The other is New Jersey Transit, which runs trains into New Jersey to the west. In the future, there are plans for Metro-North to serve this station as well. These trains currently use Grand Central Terminal a few blocks away, near 42nd Street and Park Avenue.

Besides long-distance and commuter trains, the New York City Subway has a few stations that connect directly to Penn Station. These are located at 34th Street, Herald Square, and Hudson Yards. Another rapid transit system, PATH, has a station at 33rd Street where people can catch trains every few minutes to Jersey City and on to Newark. Many bus companies serve the station as well.

Stalemate

Stalemate is a situation in chess where the player whose turn it is to move is not in check but has no legal move. 

When stalemate occurs, the game is a draw. Actual stalemate is rare, but the threat of stalemate has a big effect on endgame play. Many K+R+P vs K+R endings are drawn when stalemate cannot be avoided. The existence of stalemate is a main reason why draws are common in chess, but rare in the chess derivative shogi.

In the old Persian form of chess, shatranj, stalemate was a win for the side with the most pieces. The idea of stalemate as a draw in modern chess took a long time to be agreed. It was finally decided by the early 19th century British master J.H. Sarratt in the London Chess Club rules of 1807.

All uses of the term "stalemate" in other contexts come from its use in chess. Stalemates in bargaining, politics and general life are examples of figurative language. The term is used as a metaphor.

Hans Geiger

Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger (30 September 1882 – 24 September 1945) was a German physicist. He is perhaps best known as the co-inventor of the detector component of the Geiger counter and for the Geiger–Marsden experiment which discovered the atomic nucleus. Geiger was born at Neustadt an der Haardt, Germany. He was one of five children born to the Indologist Wilhelm Ludwig Geiger, who was professor at the University of Erlangen.

In 1902, Geiger started studying physics and mathematics at the University of Erlangen and was awarded a doctorate in 1906. In 1907 he began work with Ernest Rutherford at the University of Manchester and in 1909, along with Ernest Marsden, conducted the famous Geiger–Marsden experiment called the "gold foil experiment". Rutherford and Geiger created the Rutherford-Geiger tube, later to become the Geiger tube. 

In 1911 Geiger and John Mitchell Nuttall discovered the Geiger–Nuttall law (or rule) and performed experiments that led to Rutherford's atomic model. In 1928 Geiger and his student Walther Müller created an improved version of the Geiger tube, the Geiger–Müller tube. Geiger also worked with James Chadwick. In 1912 he became leader of the Physical-Technical Reichsanstalt in Berlin, 1925 professor in Kiel, 1929 in Tübingen, and from 1936 in Berlin.

He was a member of the Uranium Club. Geiger never expressed himself in public about the Nazis. There are reports both about him helping, and rejecting, Jewish colleagues. Geiger died in Potsdam, Germany a few months after World War II ended in Europe. He had four siblings: three sisters and one brother that were all younger than him. His brother, Rudolf Geiger, was very interested in meteorology and climatology. 

Johann Alexander Döderlein

Johann Alexander Döderlein (February 11, 1675 - October 23, 1745) was a German historian, philologist and numismatist.
He studied at University of Altdorf near Nuremberg. He was polymath and his field of work included archaeology, classical studies, meteorology, and regional history. Döderlein was a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. He was rector of the Alte Lateinschule, the former school of Weißenburg am Sand.

Lise Meitner

Lise Meitner (November 7, 1878, Vienna – October 27, 1968, Cambridge) was an Austrian-Swedish physicist. She had a very large role in discovering nuclear fission. She received her doctorate in physics from the University of Vienna in 1906. Her work with two other scientists influenced the discovery and creation of the atomic bomb.

Meitner was of Jewish descent and converted to Lutheranism.

Starting in 1907, Meitner worked with a man named Otto Hahn. She worked with Hahn throughout her entire career. Working together, they completed a lot of work in chemistry. Hahn won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, even though his work had been with her. The reason that she did not win the prize was that she was a woman. She did attend the ceremony though.

In 1914, Meitner volunteered as an X-ray technician in the Austrian army during World War I. Meitner was also the first female professor in Germany. She became a German professor in 1917. Throughout the 1920s, Meitner worked mostly on radiation. She won many prizes and awards. Around 1935, Meitner and Hahn worked together to learn more about uranium. The element Meitnerium is named after her. Later in Meitner’s life, she had many discoveries that led to the creation of the atomic bomb. She worked to make possible the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima but she did not agree the atomic bomb.

An encyclopedia editor asked Meitner to write an article about radioactivity. He had read a paper she wrote about the physical aspects of radioactivity. The letter that she got was addressed to “Herr Meitner” (Mr. Meitner). She explained that she was female and the offer was taken away. Meitner followed gender roles later in her career. British physicist Ernest Rutherford visited Berlin Laboratory. During this visit, Meitner spent the day shopping with Rutherford's wife. Meanwhile, the men talked about work. Meitner also had lots of accomplishments. After working with Hahn and investigating behavior of beta rays, she received an appointment in the radioactivity apartment and invited Meitner to join him. Soon after, Max Planck asked Meitner to be an assistant professor and lecture at the institute for theoretical physics. Meitner was the first woman in Germany to be in her position. Many news reporters were drawn to her opening lecture. 


Chien-Shiung Wu

Chien-Shiung Wu (; May 31, 1912 – February 16, 1997) was a Chinese-American particle and experimental physicist.

Wu was born in May 1912 in Liuhe, a small town near Shanghai. Wu Zhongyi, her father, participated in the 1911 revolution against the Chinese Manchu dynasty. He was the founder of an all girls’ school in China. Educating girls wasn’t seen as important at that time. Wu went to that school until she was nine. After that, she went to the Soochow Girls’ School. She graduated in 1930. She was the best student in her class.

Wu went to college at Nanjing University. She studied physics there. She graduated in 1934. She spent one year teaching in a university. A year later, she went to study X-ray crystallography, which is the study of crystals. She did so at the National Academy of Sciences in Shanghai. A woman scientist who she worked with told her to go to study in the United States. She said this because China didn’t have a very good physics program. With the help of her rich uncle, she sailed to America in 1936.

Wu started working on nuclear physics with a particle physicist named Ernest Livermore. She helped Emilio Segre. He won a Nobel Prize years later. During the same time, Japan invaded China. She didn’t hear from her family for years. She kept working.

Wu also studied the electromagnetic energy a particle gives off when it slows down. She also studied what happens when a uranium nucleus splits. For her work, she got a PhD in 1940. She became known as an expert on fission, which is the splitting of atoms.

She studied theories about atoms developed by Enrico Fermi. She ended up confirming one of his theories.

Wu continued with her work in physics in her later career. She faced a difficult hypothesis involving beta decay in 1963. Beta Decay was discovered by Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann.

Chien-Shiung Wu helped overthrow the law of conservation of parity along with Tsung Dao Lee and Chen Wing Yang. For 30 years, parity was a universal law. The theory states that parity was when an event and its reflection were the same. Scientist believed that the conservation of parity applied to all events. Chien-Shiung Wu helped to disprove this theory. She found this when studying the electrons at a low temperature. Wu did most of the work. The Nobel Prize committee did not acknowledge her. They did recognize her two male partners who won the award.

Many considered Wu's work on Fermi’s theory worthy of a Nobel prize. Her work was important but did not qualify for the prize. The two scientist she worked with on the theory about parity won a prize and she did not. People believed her work was not original.

She became the first woman to be the president of the American Physical Society. She was the first woman to receive the Comstock Award from the National Academy of Sciences. She was also the first woman to receive the Research Corporation Award. She received honorary degrees from over a dozen universities. Yale, Princeton and Harvard were some of the universities that recognized her work. Princeton gave her an honorary doctorate of science. She became the first woman to ever receive that.

Wu married Luke Yuan in 1942. She taught at Smith College in Massachusetts. After that, she taught at Princeton. In 1944, she was recruited to do top-secret work on radiation detectors for the atomic bomb project called the Manhattan Project at Columbia University. She worked in a secret facility.

After World War II, Wu heard back from her family. They had all survived.

Wu retired in 1981. She died of a stroke on February 16, 1997, in New York. She was 86 years old. Her ashes were buried in the courtyard of her father's school.

Wu was an inspiration and a trailblazer. She didn’t let racism or sexism put her down. She kept working hard. She made some amazing discoveries. Her work wasn’t credited with a Nobel Prize but she made a huge impact on the world's knowledge of fission and quantum physics.



Vera Rubin

Vera Cooper Rubin (July 23, 1928 December 25, 2016) was an American astronomer. She discovered dark matter

Rubin was born on July 23, 1928. Her parents were Rose Applebaum and Phillip Cooper.  At age 10, Rubin became fascinated by the stars in her home, Washington, D.C. At age 14, she built her first telescope.

Rubin attended Vassar College where she earned her B.A. in 1948. She earned her M.A. at Cornell University in 1951. She received her Ph.D. in astronomy at Georgetown University. At Cornell her thesis studied evidence of bulk rotation in the universe. 

Rubin taught at Georgetown before becoming a researcher at the Carnegie Institution of Science. She spent a year as a teacher in math and physics at Montgomery County Junior College. She contributed to newspapers. She was an associated editor of the Astronomical Journal and the editorial board of Science Magazine. Rubin was on the astronomical committee at Harvard University and at the National Academy of Sciences.

Rubin was an American astronomer who discovered dark matter. Dark matter is a material in the universe that does not reflect light. She and W. Kent Ford found that the stars closest to the center of the galaxy and the stars farthest from the center of the galaxy moved at the same rate.  Their findings said that mass astronomers could see only 10 percent of the galaxy's total mass. This makes dark matter invisible. Rubin joined the council of American Women in Science in 1984 to promote women in astronomy. 

Rubin was given honorary degrees from Creighton University, Harvard University, and Yale University. She won the National Medal of Sciences in 1993.

Rubin was married to Robert Rubin, a physicist. She wrote a children's book on astronomy to encourage young girls to study science. Rubin had four children named David, Allan, Judith, and Carl. Her children all became scientists. 

Rubin died in Princeton on December 25, 2016.

Hypatia

Hypatia (hy-PAY-shee-uh) of Alexandria was a mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher. She lived around 370 - 415 C.E. Hypatia was the first noted women in mathematics, philosophy, and astronomy. She lead a philosophical movement called Neoplatonism. Neoplatonism was developed from the ideas of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. 

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, a city in Egypt. During Hypatia’s time, Egypt was a great place for learning. Her father was also a mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher, so she had it in her blood line. Her father was Theon. Hypatia and her father worked on commentaries of Ptolemy's work together. Ptolemy was a Greek astronomer who was from Alexandria. Hypatia's name was also put on work done by other mathematicians. 

The Museum of Alexandria was a more like a university and library than a museum. It played a big role in education, and Hypatia’s life. Theon may have been the director of the museum at one point. Theon was interested in mathematics. This may have led Hypatia to pursue astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy.

Her skills were so notable, that she became the leader of the Neoplatonism movement in Alexandria around 400. Her reputation led students from all around the world to come visit here. She was recognized as a better philosopher than most of the men during her time. Hypatia gave lectures at her house and in lecture halls. She lectured on astronomy, mathematics, philosophy, and religious literature. She wrote a number of books about mathematics.

Synesius of Cyrene was a student of Hypatia. His letters provided some of the most important information on her life and her teachings. She taught Synesius about the building of an astrolabe.

Hypatia was never married because she said she was “wedded to the truth”. She was an acquaintance of Orestes. He was the pagan governor of Alexandria. Radical monks murdered her. They possibly murdered her because the pagans seemed to have caused enmity among the mainly Christian town. They persecuted her, and scattered her body parts around the city. She died at 45 years old, in 415 C.E.

Ada Yonath

Ada E. Yonath, Hebrew: עדה יונת , (born June 22, 1939) is an Israeli crystallographer. She received the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry together with Thomas A. Steitz and Venkatraman Ramakrishnan for studies of the structure and function of the ribosome.

She was born in the Geula quarter of Jerusalem. Her father was a rabbi. Yonath and her family moved to Tel Aviv after her father died.

She received her bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1962. She received her master's degree in biochemistry in 1964. She got both degrees from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. She received her Ph.D. in X-Ray Crystallography at the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1968. Yonath made the first protein crystallography lab at the Weizmann Institute. Her work showed the function of ribosomes. Yonath worked at Carnegie-Mellon University and MIT for several years. She stayed as Weizmann Institute for the rest of her career.

Ada Yonath is an Israeli chemist who made pictures of ribosomes using X-ray Crystallography. Ribosomes are the part of cells in the human body that put together proteins. X-ray Crystallography makes pictures of molecules by bunching them into crystals. This method is only used to make models of single atoms. Yonath used this methods to crystallize ribosomes although they are made of many atoms and proteins. This made her work very difficult. She returned to the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1970. She started the first Protein Crystallography lab in Israel. She did research at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin, Germany from 1979 to 1984. She began trying to make ribosomes into crystals in 1970.  [1]

She made the first model of a large ribosome in 1980. 

In 2006 she won the Wolf Prize in Chemistry.

She won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz. This Nobel prize was for her work in making images of ribosomes. She studied Molecular Genetics in Berlin, Germany, before winning the Nobel prize.

Yonath led a research team at the Max Planck Institute in Hamburg, Germany for 18 years. She also continued research at the Weizmann Institute of Science.


Youyou Tu

Youyou Tu (born 30 December 1930) is a Chinese pharmacologist. She won the Nobel Prize in 2015 for medicine. She is famous for making a medicine to treat Malaria. Malaria is a sickness or disease. It is spread by mosquitoes. It poorly affects a lot of people in the world. Many people have died from Malaria. Tu came up with a cure.

Tu was born on December 30, 1930.  She was born and raised in Ningbo, Zhejiang. Zhejiang is a province of China. It is located in eastern China. In 1951, she moved to Beijing. She went to the Peking University in Beijing. At the university, she studied pharmacology. In 1955, she finished college and started working at the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Beijing. It is now called the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences.

n 1969, China was having a cultural revolution against Western ideas. This means that many schools, colleges, and research centers were closed. Tu was assigned to a secret project that was to find the cure for Malaria during this time. Malaria was killing American and Vietnamese soldiers in Vietnam before the treatment was found. She studied traditional Chinese medicinal ancient text. She was trying to find an herbal treatment. The text they read gave information about a medicinal plant, Qinghao. Qinghao is also known as sweet wormwood. Tu and two other scientists found a part of the plant that helped treat Malaria. This was made into a drug that stopped and treated the disease in millions of people. This drug was called artemisinin.

Rosalyn Yalow

Rosalyn Yalow (July 19, 1921 May 30, 2011) was an American medical physicist.

Yalow was born on July 19, 1921 in the Bronx, New York City. She graduated from Hunter College in 1941. She also went to a all-female college in New York called Hunter College. Yalow was Jewish. This made it difficult to become a scientist, due to prejudice. She continued trying. Yalow got a PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Yalow became a consultant in nuclear physics at the Bronx Veteran’s Administration Hospital in 1947. She was assistant chief of radioisotope service in 1950. She was made a research professor at the Sinai School of Medicine in New York City in 1968. In 1973, she was made head of Solomon A. Berson Research Laboratory at the Bronx Veteran’s Administration Hospital. 

Yalow won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1977. She was the second woman to win that prize. She shared the award with Roger Guillemin and Andrew Schally.

Yalow was known for the creation of the radioimmunoassay (RIA). The RIA labeled things in the blood with radioactive marks. Yalow and Solomon Berson first used the RIA in 1959. It was first used to study the insulin in blood of diuabetics ( people with diabetes). This was an advancement that helped many people with diabetes. 

Maryam Mirzakhani

Maryam Mirzakhani (May 12, 1977 – July 14, 2017) was an Iranian mathematician.

She worked at Stanford University. Her research topics include Teichmüller theory, hyperbolic geometry, ergodic theory, and symplectic geometry.

On 13 August 2014, Mirzakhani became both the first woman and the first Iranian honored with the Fields Medal, the most prestigious award in mathematics.

On 14 July 2017, Mirzakhani died of breast cancer at the age of 40.

Mirzakhani was born in May 1977 in Tehran, Iran. She enjoyed math and puzzles in high school. She earned her bachelor's degree at the Sharif University of Technology in Tehran. Mirzakhani then went to Harvard to earn a Ph.D. in 2004.

In high school, Mirzakhani found her talents in math. She decided to reconsider her career goals. This was made possible by her principal. Her principal tried to give women the same chances as men to succeed.

Mirzakhani was also given extra math assignments, which gave her access to university laboratories. She was also allowed to study by herself in the library. This privilege was only given to a few people.

Mirzakhani was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013. She died of the cancer on July 14, 2017 in Palo Alto, California, aged 40.

Mirzakhani won the Fields Medal award, the highest mathematical award, in 2014 for her accomplishments in math. She won this award because of her work on Riemann surfaces, a complex mathematical subject. Her work on this subject has improved the basics of both mathematics and physics.

Mirzakhani proved multiple relationships between "moduli" spaces, classes of Riemann surface structures. Her talent led her to be selected twice for the Math Olympiad Team.

Girls had never been part of the Iranian Math Olympiad team. Mirzakhani was the first woman to be on the team and was selected two times in a row. She won gold medals for her team. In 1994, she only had one point taken off and in 1995, she had a perfect score. This was a big accomplishment since she was the first Iranian to do so.

Mirzakhani has worked as a math teacher at Princeton University and Stanford University. At Stanford, her interests changed a little. Mirzakhani still worked on geometry and symmetry but started to focus more on theories on Teichmiller dynamics, advanced geometric strategies. Her research was deemed as mathematical research into nature's abstract concepts.


Emilie du Chatelet

Émilie du Châtelet was a French physicist. She was born on December 17, 1706, in Paris, France. Du Châtelet was born into an aristocratic family. She received an excellent education. Du Châtelet learned science, literature, and music. She married the Marquis of Châtelet. He lived away from Paris because he had a military and political career. They had three children. Du Châtelet took private lessons in maths from Pierre-Louis Moreau.

Du Châtelet had a 15-year affair with Francois Marie Arouet de Voltaire. Voltaire recognised her talents. Châtelet helped Voltaire write his book, "Elements of Newton’s Philosophy". She had an unwanted child with Jean François de Saint-Lambert when she was 42. She translated "Principia Mathematica" by Isaac Newton into French while she was pregnant. She died from an infection six days after giving birth to her daughter. It was 1749.

Du Châtelet’s translation of "Principia Mathematica" is still used today. She knew that her work was not appreciated during her time. Years after she died, she was recognized as a role model for girls and women. Du Châtelet is still celebrated around the world for her work in Newtonian studies and mathematics.

Mary Somerville

Mary Somerville was a Scottish science writer and a polymath. She was also famous for supporting more education for women and supporting more civil rights for women. 

Somerville was born on December 26, 1780, in Jedburgh, Scotland. She was the fifth of seven children. She was one of three who lived to be adults. Her father, William George Fairfax, was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy. He would go on long trips away. Somerville's mother didn't try to educate her daughters; she thought that all girls needed to know was how to cook and clean. When Somerville wasn't doing household chores, she would often go to the seaside and the moors.

When Somerville's father came home, he discovered that his ten-year-old daughter could not read or write. He sent her to a boarding school. By her teenage years, Somerville had become interested in algebra. Her parents got angry. They told her not to study it - they worried that studying mathematical concepts would cause her physical and mental harm. "Mary Somerville." Scientists: Their Lives and Works, UXL, 2006. Student Resources in Context. Accessed 31 Mar. 2017.

In 1804, when she was 24, Somerville got married to Samuel Grieg. She found that marriage gave her independence from her parents. She began studying algebra. She had two sons, but her husband died in 1807. As a widow, she found more freedom to study and learned many more mathematical concepts."Mary Somerville." Scientists: Their Lives and Works, UXL, 2006. Student Resources in Context. Accessed 31 Mar. 2017.

In 1812, she married again. Her second husband was William Somerville. They had four children together. Somerville began experiments on solar radiation with her newfound support from William.

She studied the sun's radiation effects on Earth's substances. In 1826, she published her first paper, "On the Magnetizing Power of the More Refrangible Solar Rays." She later published two more papers and two books. She later moved to Italy and started her third book. In 1848, she had a publication called "Physical Geography."

Somerville wrote many books. Somerville's second book led to the discovery of Neptune. She then became the one of the first two women to be named Honorary members of the Royal Astronomical Society. Somerville had a picture hung in the Royal Society's great hall. She won the Victoria Gold Medal from the Royal Geographic Society in 1870. 

In 1860, her only surviving son died. Her husband died 5 years later. Somerville became sad. Her daughter told her to work on more writing projects. She did, but she wasn't in touch with modern science. She began to promote civil rights and higher women's education. She died at age 92 in Naples, Italy, on November 19, 1872. Oxford University named one of its colleges after her.

May-Britt Moser

May-Britt Moser is a Norwegian psychologist and neuroscientist.

Moser was born on Jan 4, 1962 in Fosnavåg, on a coastal island north of Bergen, Norway. She married Edvard Moser as a student of the University of Oslo in 1985. They had two kids, Isabel and Ailin. The Mosers were directors and coordinators of the Kavil Institute for systems Neuroscience and the Centre for Neural Computation at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology for many years, but they divorced in 2016.

Each earned a PhD in neurobiology in 1995. She used rats as test subjects during her research because their nervous system is very similar to humans. They discovered brain cells that allow animals to move from one place to another. These are called grid cells, and they fire when the rats pass a certain location. Over time, this helped the rats move purposely around the room and navigate their surroundings. The Mosers won a Nobel Prize, an important award. She won this award in 2014 and shared this with John O’Keefe, another neuroscientist. They also won the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize.

Starboy (song)

National Cycling Museum

KOERS. Museum van de wielersport. (till 2018 the Cycling Museum - WieMu) is a museum in the Belgian city of Roeselare. The museum shows the history of the bicycle and cycling. The museum started officially on 27 March 1998 at ‘Het Polenplein’, in the earlier fire-station.

The Cycling Museum was founded in 1985 as part of the earlier Municipal Museum of Roeselare. The city of Roeselare took that decision because the region can be seen as ‘the cradle of the flandriens’. A lot of flandriens and racing cyclists are born in the region. The municipality proper has known a lot of popular racing cyclists for example Odiel Defraeye, the first Belgian winner of the Tour of France and several world-champions: Jean-Pierre Monseré, Benoni Beheyt, Patrick Sercu, Freddy Maertens… In the beginning, the museum only showed a few old bicycles and organised an exhibition in summer.
In 1998, they made the final decision to replace the old folkloristic museum for a real Cycling Museum, the National Cycling Museum. Ferdy Callewaert was the first conservator till he retired in 2006. Old-racing cyclist Freddy Maertens worked from 2000 till 2007 at the museum and he welcomed often the visitors. In 2005 King Albert II visited the museum. In 2010 the museum got the short name ‘WieMu’. 
After a renovation, the museum re-opened on 8 September 2018. The new name of the museum is "KOERS. Museum van de wielersport". At the museum, there are also the municipal touristic service and a pub.

The museum shows the history of bicycles from 1760 till now: all sorts of old bicycles and modern bicycles used for professional duties, leisure and sport. In the beginning, that was the heart of the collection of the cycling museum. After some years, the museum became more and more specialized in cycle-racing. So the museum has a lot of racing-bicycles, cycling-trophies and -souvenirs, cycling-clothes, portraits of racing cyclists etc. 
In one of the halls, you find a lot about the local world-champion Jean-Pierre Monseré, who lost his life as world-champion during a race in 1971. Another hall shows an old workshop of bicycle-maker Hallaert where you can learn about the technical evolution of the bicycle.
The cycling museum has a documentation center about cycling with a lot of photos, old newspapers and (cycling-)magazines, programme brochures and cycling archives. The museum publishes regular exhibition catalogues or books of exercises. Since 2012 the museum publishes the cycling-historic magazine ‘Etappe’.

The museum ‘WieMu’ is in the earlier fire-station. The station was built between 1899 and 1902. Till 1962 it was a fire-station. During World War I, German soldiers lived in the station. On 21 July 1917, it was bombed by British aircrafts. After the war it was rebuilt. The building was also used for several public services such as a festive hall, a school, sportaccommodation and a folkloristic museum. The building is now a classified monument and partly restored.

Great spotted woodpecker

The great spotted woodpecker ("Dendrocopos major") is a medium-sized woodpecker with black and white plumage and a red patch on the lower belly. Males and young birds also have red markings on the neck or head.

This species is found across Eurasia and parts of North Africa. It is usually resident, but in the north some migrate if the conifer cone crop fails.

Some individuals have recolonised Ireland and some have got to North America. Great spotted woodpeckers chisel into trees to find food or excavate nest holes, and also drum for contact and territorial advertisement. They have anatomical adaptations to manage the physical stresses from the hammering.

The bird occurs in all types of woodlands and eats a wide range of food. It gets seeds out of pine cones, insect larvae from inside trees, and chicks of other birds from their nests. It breeds in holes excavated in living or dead trees, unlined apart from wood chips. When the young fledge they are fed by the adults for about ten days.

Ferrous metal recycling

Metals containing iron are recycled, so the iron can be used again. Steel is the metal recycled the most. One way iron is recycled is by adding carbon, which can make steel.

Steel containers, cans, cars, appliances, and building materials are the most recycled things in the United States. In 2008, 97% of the amount of steel used to build things was recycled. More than the amount of steel used to make cars was recycled. Most appliances are about 75% steel.

Iron is recycled because it costs less to recycle it than to mine iron and make it usable.

Armistice of Villafranca

The armistice and preliminaries of Villafranca were signed on 11 July 1859 in Villafranca di Verona , in the Veneto , by France and Austria. It put an end to the Austro-Franco-Sardinian War which constitutes for Italy, the second Italian War of Independence.

After the difficult battles of Magenta (4 June) and Solferino (24 June), Napoleon III , without consulting his Sardinian ally Cavour , proposed the armistice on 8 July and an interview on 11 July with the Emperor of Austria François- Joseph I . Although victorious, Napoleon III was frightened by the hecatomb (nearly 40,000 killed or wounded at Solferino) and the idea of having to continue an autumn and winter campaign against the Austrians entrenched in the quadrilateral. Moreover, the government and the Empress send him alarming information about the state of French opinion, Which is execrable. In particular, the Catholics, hitherto supported by the imperial regime, fear for the Papal States and the Pope's independence if Austria were eliminated from Italy. Finally, an anti-French feeling spread in Germany, where the Austrians were supported. The number of Prussian deaths is nearly 400 000 soldiers near the Rhine, stripped of French troops.

In Villafranca, it is agreed that Austria cedes Lombardy (except Mantua and Peschiera) to France, which restores it to the kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia. An Italian confederation under the presidency of Pope Pius IX was created, the Veneto under Austrian sovereignty being part of it. The dukes of Modena , Parma, and Tuscany, driven away by revolutions, found their thrones.

Cavour, not consulted, resigned on 10 July, while King Victor-Emmanuel II gave his agreement "in a personal capacity", thus leaving the door open to any governmental retraction.

These preliminaries were confirmed by the Treaty of Zurich of 11 November 1859.

Cancer, for example is malignant and sometimes spreads to other places on the body. Some tumours have a cause that makes them grow. For some tumours no cause is known. A tumour usually forms as a lump or mass.

Finery forge

A finery forge is a hearth (a brick fireplace) used to make wrought iron by burning pig iron. Finery forges were probably used in the 3rd century BC. In the 18th and 19th century it was replaced by the puddling process.
China made finery forges before 200 BC. Europe made finery forges around 1200 AD. Europe’s finery forges were worse than China’s until 1400 AD. Europe started powering their finery forges with water wheels. In 1700 AD, Europe made blast furnaces and started using puddling techniques

In Germany and Sweden most finery forges only had one fire used for everything.

Walloon finery forges were used in north Sweden and made oregrounds iron. Oregrounds iron was the best iron available in the 18th century.

Pig iron is melted, making a lump of iron called a bloom, and slag. The iron lump is then hit with a hammer many times. Hitting the iron with a hammer gets the slag out of the iron, so the iron can be used.

Cain

In the Book of Genesis (Bible, Old Testament), Cain is a son of Adam and Eve. He killed his brother Abel.

Cain and Abel both gave gifts to God. God liked Abel's gift more than Cain's. Cain became jealous of Abel. Later, Cain hit Abel in the head with a rock. Abel died. When God asked Cain where Abel was, Cain pretended he did not know. He said, "Am I my brother's keeper?"

God punished Cain by exile: He made Cain leave the place where he lived. He made Cain go away. He told Cain that if he tried to build a farm, the earth "would not yield up its strength." When Cain said he was afraid, God put a mark on him to protect him.

Cain went east and lived as a wanderer. Some scholars say that the story of Cain was told to explain why some humans build farms and stay in one place and others move from place to place.

Beowulf (2007 movie)

Beowulf is a 2007 American-British 3D motion-capture fantasy movie. Based off the epic poem, it stars Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, Robin Wright, Brendan Gleeson, Crispin Glover, Angelina Jolie, John Malkovich and Alison Lohman. It was directed by Robert Zemeckis and released on November 16 2007, to financial success and positive critical reviews.

In the early Middle Ages, the court of King Hrothgar of Denmark (Anthony Hopkins), is plagued by the monster Grendel (Crispin Glover), who attacks the king's people when they celebrate. Hearing of the king's plight, the warrior Beowulf (Ray Winstone), travels to the kingdom with a band of his fellow Geatish warriors, including his friend Wiglaf (Brendan Gleeson), to slay the beast. When they arrive, Beowulf falls in love with the king's wife Queen Wealthow (Robin Wright), who reciprocates his affections.

The warriors celebrate in the king's mead hall Heorot in an attempt to lure Grendel out. When the monster attacks, Beowulf fights him nude and unarmed (it is revealed that he is invulnerable to man-made weapons). In the fight, Beowulf discovers Grendel has hypersensitive hearing, which is why he attacks Hrothgar's celebrations (the noise from the mead hall is painful to him). After his left eardrum is ruptured, Grendel shrinks in size and, while trying to escape, Beowulf restrains him and uses the door of the hall to sever the monster's arm. To thank him for defeating the monster, Hrothgar gives Beowulf his golden drinking horn, which commemorates his victory over the dragon Fafnir.

Grendel retreats to his cave and with his final breaths, he tells his mother (Angelina Jolie), what has happened to him and she swears revenge. She travels to Heorot and butchers Beowulf's soldiers while they sleep. Hrothgar informs Beowulf and Wiglaf, who were not sleeping in the hall when the attack took place, that this was the work of Grendel's mother; she is the last surviving member of the Water Demons, long thought to have left the land forever. The two travel to Grendel's cave to slay her. When Beowulf encounters her, she takes on the form of a beautiful young woman. She promises to make him the greatest king who has ever lived, in exchange for the drinking horn and a son who will replace Grendel.

Beowulf agrees to the deal and returns to Heorot, claiming that she has been slain by him. Hrothgar, however, realizes the truth and indirectly tells Beowulf that many years before, he was seduced by Grendel's mother, and Grendel was the product of their affair. Beowulf is then crowned King of the Danes, much to the dismay of Unferth (John Malkovich), Hrothgar's adviser. The king kills himself by jumping off the castle and on to the beach. His body is then washed away by the sea.

The years go by, and Beowulf and Wealthow are married. They have grown apart over the years and are husband and wife in name alone. Beowulf has taken a lover called Ursula (Alison Lohman), but is sterile after his affair with Grendel's mother. One day, Unferth's slave Cain finds the golden drinking horn in Grendel's lair and brings it back to the kingdom. That night, a dragon decimates a nearby town, but Unferth is spared to deliver a message to Beowulf; the beast is his illegitimate son with Grendel's mother. Removing the drinking horn has voided their agreement and Grendel's mother has sent the dragon to destroy his father's kingdom.

Tulip breaking virus

Tulip breaking virus is one of five plant viruses that cause both tulips and lilies to have a different petal color effect, such as stripes or flames on an otherwise single color flower. "Tulip breaking virus" is in the same virus group as "Tulip top-breaking virus (TTBV), Tulip bandbreaking virus (TBBV), Rembrandt tulip-breaking virus (ReTBV)" and "Lily mottle virus (LMoV)" but they are all considered different viruses. "Tulip breaking virus" can come in two forms: Severe tulip breaking virus and mild tulip breaking virus. Severe tulip breaking virus can cause light colors to appear on tulips, whereas mild tulip breaking virus tends to cause darker colors to appear.

"Tulip breaking virus" infects the bulb of the tulip or lily and changes the color of the petals. This change depends on the strain of the virus, the type of plant and the age of the plant when it gets infected. "Tulip breaking virus" causes differences in the pigments in the flowers, which in turn changes the colors. 

In lilies, it takes two weeks after infection to see a change in petal color and then changes the shape of the leaves and flowers.

In all forms, the virus harms the bulb and makes it more difficult for the plant to sprout again year after year. Eventually, the bulb is unable to flower again, which is why rare color broken bulbs from the past are no longer in existence.

"Tulip breaking virus" used to be considered the earliest recorded virus, but now it is considered the second earliest, virus-induced leaf chlorosis being the first in 752 AD. 

The first time "tulip breaking virus" was described was in 1576 by Carolus Clusius, a Flemish professor of botany. He called it "rectification" because he believed that the color changes were the plant trying to purify or "rectify" itself. Clusius also noticed the harm done to the bulb by the virus, but did not know that a virus was causing it. In fact, it took until a decade after World War I for scientists to figure out that a plant virus was the culprit for the color changes. This was considered quite late because plant viruses themselves were known to scientists since 1897. 

Before it was known that a virus caused the color changes, it was thought that environmental factors, such as soil, fertilizer or bulb storage, or chronic disorders were to blame. 

The virus was discovered by Dorothy Cayley at the John Innes Horticultural Institution in Norfolk, England. She experimented by transferring parts of an infected bulb to a non-infected bulb and seeing if it remained a solid color, or became "broken" in color. She concluded that even transferring minute amounts lead to infection in a healthy bulb.

The virus was then proven to be transferred by at least four species of aphids. The virus is picked up and lives in the aphid's mouths and is then transferred to another plant when the aphid feeds.

In the 1960s it was finally proven that "tulip breaking virus" was indeed a virus, and today its genetic code has been partially sequenced. 

It is very difficult to control the spread of "tulip breaking virus". It is found world-wide and is very common in southern Europe because of the abundant aphid population. Aphid transmission causes millions of dollars of damage, but mineral oils and pyrethroids are used to combat the pests. 

After an experiment was done looking at populations of aphids and time of year, it was concluded that "tulip breaking virus" transmission starts in April, even though the majority of aphids were not found until May.

The United States, Great Britain and other countries do not allow the sale of infected bulbs, in order to restrict the virus. 

Most tulips today are bred to have stripes, rather than being infected. However, many tulip enthusiasts dislike the bred tulips and prefer the virus infected plants. There are only a few truly "broken" older plants, alive today only because the virus has not completely stunted the growth. An example of this is "Absalon" from 1780 which has gold flames against a dark brown background.

Currently, optical sensors are used to detect "tulip breaking virus". Recent research looked at the different types of optical sensors and concluded that spectral cameras may be the best type for specifically finding "tulip breaking virus", however it was only a bit more accurate than an expert's visual assessment. Other types of optical sensors considered in the experiment were color cameras, but they were not as effective as spectral cameras nor visual assessment by experts.

Vijayalaya Chola

Vijayalaya Chola was a king of South India, and founded the imperial Chola dynasty. He ruled over the region to the north of the river Kaveri River.The ancient Chola kingdom once famous in Tamil literature and in the writings of Greek merchants and geographers faded into darkness after c. 300 CE. Cholas during this period almost completely disappeared from their native land. They seem to have held on to their old capital city of Urayur. This 'dark' age of Tamil history came to an end with the ascendency of the Pandyas and the Pallavas. The Cholas had to wait for another three centuries until the accession of Vijayalaya in the second quarter of the ninth century to re-establish their dynasty.

At the time of 848 CE, there was a struggle or war between the Pallavas and Pandyas. Vijayalaya Chola used this as his own oppurtunity. He captured the Thanjavur region from Elango Mutharaiyars . In this disturbed state of affairs, Vijayalaya defeated the Pandyas, and made himself the ruler of Thanjavur and the surrounding Chola country. He also defeated the Pallavas. After Vijayalaya’s capture of Thanjavur, the Pandyan king Varagunavarman II (c. 862 – 885 CE) made alliance with the Pallava king Nandivarman III (c. 846 – 869 CE). Nandhivarman wished to destroy the growing influence of Chola power under Vijayalaya and called upon the Varagunavarman to help suppress Vijayalaya. Varaguna led an expedition into the Chola country. The Pandyan army reached the north bank of the Kaveri near Thanjavur. Vijayalaya, by this time was aging and was an invalid. The crown prince Aditya I took control of the army in the defence of the Chola kingdom. Vijayalaya was succeeded after his death c. 871 CE by his son Aditya I.

The Tiruvalangadu plates state that Vijayalaya captured the city of Tanjavur and made it his capital and that he also built in it a temple to the goddess Nisumbhasudani (Durga). The Kanyakumari inscription states that he developed the city of Tanjore.Vijayalaya took the title of Parakesarivarman. Chola kings succeeding him took the titles of Parakesari and Rajakesari in turns. This is probably to acknowledge their ancestors Parakesari and Rajakesari.Narttamalai, Pudukkottai has a solesvara temple attributed to Vijayalaya.

Prof. Babu Joseph from Kottayam, National executive member of Swatantra Party who attended the meeting of 50th year of Commemorating Swatantra Party which is held in Mumbai on August 1, 2009. It was founded by C. Rajagopalachari in reaction to what he felt was the Jawaharlal Nehru-dominated Indian National Congress's increasingly socialist and statist outlook. Swatantra ("Freedom") stood for a market-based economy.The party was thus favoured by some traders and industrialists, but at the state-level its leadership was dominated by the traditional wealthy classes such as "zamindars" (landlords) and formerly princely states. Its membership was not restricted on the basis of religion, unlike the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Jana Sangh. In 1960, Rajagopalachari and his colleagues drafted a 21-point manifesto detailing why Swatantra Party had to be formed, even though they were formerly Congressmen and associates of Nehru during the struggle for independence. The Prime Minister was highly critical of Swatantra, dubbing the party as belonging to "the middle ages of lords, castles and zamindars.

In the 1962 general election, the first after its formation, Swatantra received 6.8 percent of the total votes and won 18 seats in the third Lok Sabha (1962–67). It emerged as the main opposition to the dominant Congress in four states—Bihar, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Orissa. By the next general election in 1967, Swatantra had become a significant force in some parts of India; it won 8.7 percent of the votes and became the single-largest opposition party in the fourth Lok Sabha (1967–71) with 44 seats. In 1971, Swatantra joined a "Grand Alliance" of parties from across the political spectrum who aimed to defeat Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The party secured eight seats, winning only 3% of the votes. The next year, in 1972, its founder Rajagopalachari died, and Swatantra declined rapidly.

Mabel Cáceres

Mabel Cáceres or Mabel Cáceres Calderón is a Peruvian journalist, and the founder and editor-in-chief of El Búho (The Owl). She received the 2016 Courage in Journalism Award from the International Women's Media Foundation. 

In 1999, Cáceres was the director of a local TV channel owned by a university, when the government of Peru’s president Fujimori suspended the channel for a year. Cáceres, along with a group of intellectuals, journalists, and friends, started El Búho as a weekly newspaper. 

Mabel Cáceres studied journalism, communication, and related programs at the Catholic University of Santa María in Arequipa, Peru from 1984 to 1990. In 1997, she received a master's degree in Communication and Media Studies from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru in Lima, Peru.

In 1989 Cáceres went to work for "Correo" newspaper. In 1991 she worked with the newspaper "Arequipa al Día". From 1992 to 1999 she was the general director of the Proyecto TV UNSA at the Universidad Nacional de San Agustín. From 2006 to 2011 she was the director of the political-cultural television program "Contrastes" on Channel 53, TV MUNDO, in Arequipa. In 2000 she became the director of "El Búho" in Arequipa, in partnership with the poet Alonso Ruiz Rosas and writer Ody Gonzales. Together they started El Búho as a weekly newspaper. 

Cáceres has been sued for defamation 16 times, and has won all the lawsuits. Some of the editors received sentences, but they were overturned by the Supreme Court. The Press and Society Institute (IPYS) provides for El Búho's legal defense because it considers that the complaints against the weekly are an attack on freedom of the press and democracy. 

Money was always a problem. Because the magazine is often critical of the local mining company, Cerro Verde, as well as the regional government, they do not put ads in the magazine. In 2001 El Búho stopped publication for a month because they could not pay the bills. A grant from an international agency kept them going until 2011, when they had to cut back from weekly to a magazine format. El Búho TV was broadcast on the Viva TV channel in Arequipa, until pressures from politicians and advertisers took it off the air. Today the program continues on a YouTube channel.

Iron filings

Iron filings are very small pieces of iron that look like a dark gray powder. They are a common by-product of metalworking. Iron filing are often used in schools to show magnetic field lines. When filings are placed in a magnetic field, they become small magnets. This is because iron is a ferromagnetic material. The south pole of each particle attracts the north poles of its neighbors. In this way filings create chains parallel to the direction of the magnetic field.

Heteronormativity

Heteronormativity is the belief that everyone is heterosexual by nature, and every other form of human sexuality is not as good as heterosexuality, or even an illness that needs to be fixed. In a heteronormative system, there are two strict genders, men and women, and everyone must behave according to their gender role in society. A heteronormative view of the world believes that a person's sex decides their sexuality, gender identity and gender roles.

Homophobia, transphobia, and heterosexism could not exist without heteronormativity.

According to queer theory, societies force heteronormativity on people it does not fit, such as LGBT people, queer people, and intersex people.

Michael Warner made the word "heteronormativity" popular in 1991 in one of the first books on queer theory. It came from Gayle Rubin's idea of the "sex/gender system" and Adrienne Rich's idea of "compulsory heterosexuality." According to Samuel A. Chambers, heteronormativity shows what societies expect, demand, and allow when they consider relations between men and women to be the only normal ones.

People who argue against heteronormativity include Cathy J. Cohen, Michael Warner, and Lauren Berlant. They argue that it holds down those who do not fit it, marks them as outsiders, keeps them out of society, and makes it hard for them to express themselves. Heteronormative policies and institutions strengthen the belief that people are heterosexual and that there are only two genders and sexes by nature. They argue that heteronormative culture gives an unfair advantage to heterosexual people (this is called heterosexism). It causes members of society to keep LGBT people out of work, school, and the greater society, sometimes using the law.

According to the cultural anthropologist Gayle Rubin, heteronormativity ranks sexual practices from "good sex" to "bad sex." This "sex hierarchy" ranks sex between two married heterosexual people for the purpose of creating a child as "good," and ranks people and acts that fall short of this standard lower until they become "bad sex." Gay couples who are married are somewhere in the middle. Gay people who have sex with many partners are also in the middle, but below gay married couples. Patrick McCreery, a lecturer at New York University, believes this is the reason why gay people are attacked for doing things that straight people also do, such as watching pornography or practicing BDSM.

McCreery says that this "sex hierarchy" also exists in the workplace. Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people are more likely to be kept out of work the lower they fall. Transgender people fall especially low in the hierarchy and face the most obvious discrimination. This leaves many LGBT people without jobs. People can be fired for being LGBT, or they can never be offered a job for the same reason. In 1991 the restaurant Cracker Barrel in the United States made the news when it fired a lesbian worker. There was no law against this, and there is still no law against it in most of the country.

Intersex babies can be born with genitals that don’t match those of most other people, such as a very small penis or very large clitoris. Doctors and parents often force intersex children to have surgery to make them look more like most men and women. Usually they are healthy without this and it is not necessary. Most intersex children are not allowed to decide if they want this surgery. This is not because there is anything wrong with their bodies. Rather, parents are often afraid that their children will be judged. In other words, doctors and parents force them to have surgery for social reasons, not biological ones.

Heterosexism

Heterosexism is the belief that only men and women should have sex, or that only men and women should love each other as more than a friend or family member. It is also the belief that sex and love between men and women is better than other types of sex and love. Heterosexism is not just something a single person can believe but is taught by society and culture. Heterosexist beliefs can cause people to act unfairly towards people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or asexual.

Heterosexism is related to homophobia and biphobia in the same way that sexism is related to misogyny and transphobia.

Tribes of Israel

The Israelites were divided into twelve tribes, according to the twelve sons of the Biblical patriarch, Jacob:
The Land of Israel was divided among those tribes, but there were a few exceptions:

Sanhedrin

The Sanhedrin was a group of judges who led the Jewish people of every city in the Land of Israel. Their name is Greek and means "council" or "assembly." There were between twenty-three and seventy-one judges in each Sanhedrin. According to the Hebrew Bible, God commanded Moses and the Israelites to make councils of judges and to do what they said.

The Great Sanhedrin in Jerusalem led the other councils. It met every day except on holidays and Shabbat. After the Romans destroyed the Second Temple, the Great Sanhedrin moved to Galilee. It made its last law in 358 CE when it abandoned the Hebrew calendar. It stopped meeting because of persecution. Some people have tried to bring it back, such as Napoleon Bonaparte. These attempts have not been successful so far.

1978 Sikh–Nirankari clashes

On 13 April 1978, a violent incident happened between the Sant Nirankari Mission and traditional Sikhs. This was at Amritsar, Punjab, India. Sixteen people were killed.

This incident eventually led to Operation Blue Star and the Punjab insurgency in the 1980s. Clashes occurred when Akhand Kirtani Jatha and Damdami Taksal members led by Fauja Singh protested against and tried to stop a convention of Sant Nirankari Mission followers. This incident is considered to be a starting point in the events leading to Operation Blue Star and the 1980s insurgency in Punjab. 

The turning point in the Sikh-Nirankari relationship is believed to have come after Avtar Singh took over as the sect chief in 1943. He not only proclaimed himself “Satguru” but also introduced a book “Avtar Bani” and allegedly tried to copy Sikh symbols like starting the system of Sat Piare etc. He was successful in organising Nirankaris into a powerful sect. However, in his book “A History of The Sikhs”, Khushwant Singh noted that the fundamental difference between both was that the Nirankaris were worshiping gurus other than the 10 recognised by the Sikhs.

However, the conflict reached its peak on April 13, 1978. Activists of the Akhand Kirtni Jatha and Damdai Taksal marched towards the venue of a Nirankari convention in Amritsar. It led to a clash that left at least 17 dead and a majority of them were Sikhs.

Following the deadly clash in 1978, Akal Takht issued a hukamnama asking Sikhs to sever ties with Nirankari Sikhs. Later in 1980 in Delhi, Akhand Kirtani Jatha’s Ranjit Singh killed Nirankari chief Gurbachan Singh. Ranjit Singh was later nominated as Akal Takht Jathedar.

Kenneth I of Scotland

Cináeda mac Ailpín (Modern Gaelic: "Coinneach mac Ailpein"; 810 — 13 February 858) often known as Kenneth I and nicknamed the Conqueror (Scottish Gaelic: "an Conqueror") was the King of Scotland from 843 until his death in 858. He was also the King of the Picts from 843 to 858 and the King of Dál Riata from 841 until the disestablishment of the title in 850. He was the first Scottish king. However, according to Scottish mythology, he was the sixty-ninth Scottish king. However, there is little evidence to prove this.

He inherited the throne of Dál Riata from his father, Alpin II (Alpin mac Echdach), founder of the Alpínid dynasty. Kenneth conquered the kingdom of the Picts in 843 after defeating the Pictish king, Drest X. Kenneth became the fist Pictish king to rule under the Alpínid dynasty. He started a campaign to conquer all of Scotland and assimilate the Picts which eventually gave him his nickname, "the Conqueror". Forteviot became the capital of his kingdom. He fought of the Britons of the Kingdom of Strathclyde and the Vikings where he kicked both of their troops off of Scotland and where Kenneth eventually defeated them. Kenneth also relocated relics including the Stone of Scone from Iona Abbey in Iona to his new domain.

Kenneth was one of Europe's most powerful rulers and was considered one of Scotland's greatest kings during his time. Because of his reputation as one of Scotland's greatest kings, he became an important figure in Scottish history. He managed to put down rebellions and invasions from other kingdoms such as the Vikings. He was the first King of Scotland. He unified the Gaels with the Picts, thus, he formed a united kingdom of Scotland.

Not much is known about Kenneth's birth except he was born around 810 in Iona, Argyllshire and was the son of King Alpin II of Dalriada, a land which covered modern day Northern Ireland and the Hebrides - Argyll.

Upon his fathers death in 839 he became king of Dalriada styled "Cinaed, son of Alpin" and also king of Scots due to the fact that the Hebrides - Argyll were important parts of the land at the time. At this time the Picts were conquered by Vikings with Bridei VI of Pictland being defeated, and Kenneth was set to become the next monarch. Although it wasn't until 843 he became king of the now united Pictish & Scottish tribes.

On February 13, 858 in Forteviot, Kenneth died of natural causes. He was buried in Iona and succeeded by his brother Donald MacAlpin or Domnall MacAilpín.

Ever since the 1800s, depictions of Kenneth have started to appear, first in Edinburgh Portrait Gallery, and later with some more depictions. Depictions of Kenneth are hard to find but the ones used the most are the frieze in Edinburgh and a newly found depiction from the 1700's.
Donald I, king of Picts - His brother (ruled 858-862)

Constantine I, king of Picts - His son (ruled 862-877)

Aed, king of Picts - His other son (ruled 877-878)

Theodicy

Theodicy is a branch of theology that seeks to explain why a God that is seen as all-loving, all-seeing, and all-powerful allows evil to exist. The word comes from the Greek words for God and Judgment and so means the judgment of God. It was first made up by the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz in 1710 in his work "Théodicée". The subject has been the focus of argument and thought for hundreds of years before that and since.

Theodicy tries to explain why God, who has complete free will, has the power to change anything he wants to, can see all the evil in the world and is all-loving and compassionate, yet does nothing to alleviate the suffering in the world, especially the suffering of innocents.

The weakness of the arguments for Theodicy are often used by atheists to emphasise the problems that go with the belief in God.

There are many arguments to try and explain evil; here is an incomplete list:

Láadan

Láadan is a feminist constructed language. Its creator was Suzette Haden Elgin. She believed that Western languages were better for saying what men think than what women think. She created the language to make it easier for women to say what they think. For example, Láadan has many words and suffixes for saying how you feel about what you are saying. It also includes words for saying if you know that what you are saying is true, and if so, how.

The language became part of a series of science fiction books, Native Tongue. In the book, a group of women create Láadan as a way to fight a society ruled by men.

Láadan is a tonal language. Some syllables are said in a higher voice or tone than others. There are two tones:
Láadan itself is a three-syllable word, LA-a-dan, where the first syllable is said in a high tone.

Láadan has five vowels:

Láadan does not have the consonants p, t, k, g, or s. The consonants b, d, sh, m, n, l, r, w, y, and h are the same as in English. There is also:

Most Láadan sentences have three short words called particles:
In Láadan, the verbs come first. Verbs are the same words as adjectives. There are no articles like an or the. The object of a verb has the suffix -(e)th. It usually comes after the subject. The prefix me- says that the subject of a verb is plural. The word "ra" means the same thing as English "not".

New Láadan words are made by adding prefixes and suffixes to old words. Each part of a word stays the same when it combines with other parts. Because of this, it is called an agglutinative language. The affixes (prefixes and suffixes) can be used to show feelings and attitudes. Many languages can only show these by tone of voice, body language, or roundabout speech.

Pronouns in Láadan are made of many parts. The letter "l" is used for I and we. The letter "n" is used for you. The letter "b" is used for he, she, it, and they.

The vowel "e" usually comes after these letters. "a" can come after them instead to show that someone is loved. If the person is hated, "lhe-" can be put before the word.

The suffix "-zh" makes a pronoun plural but less than four. "-n" makes it plural and greater than four. So "lazh" means "we, who are few and loved." "Lheben" means "they, who are many and who I hate."

Cell is an evil artificial life form, created using cells from several of the main characters in the series, that travels back in time so he can become the perfect warrior. In order to do this, he must absorb Androids #17 and #18.

In his "Imperfect" form, Cell walks fully upright on two legs (unlike his "larval" form). His facial features have not yet fully complete and he still retains an orifice-like mouth rather than normal human-like features seen in later forms. The two sections of his head go off in a V-shape. Cell has orange color parts near his abdominal area, the back of his head, and even near the area where gentials would be found. He has two wings which are both green with black spots.He has three fingers in the manga, but five fingers and three toes (just as similar as Frieza and King Cold) in the anime. He has a tail like Frieza and King Cold, but also has a stinger on the end of it. He has black sections as well near his abdominal area, in the middle between the two sections on his head, and even the black part of the opposite side of his tail. He even has visible veins in both of his arms, legs, and even some in the joints in his upper body. His eyes are pink (blue in the manga colored pages) with thin reptilian slits.

In his "Semi-Perfect" form, Cell's wings disappear, and he becomes much more humanoid, he also becomes quite a bit more muscular. While the nose is not yet fully formed, he now has an actual mouth. The two sections of his head now go straight into the air. In this form, he is taller. His tail is longer and slightly thicker than before, and comes from his back, as well as becoming orange and black. His voice is deeper than his first form. The back of his head and the black section on his forehead are now formed together as a ball in between the two sections on his head. His lips are now the color pink, and the black sections above his lips look like a mustache (but it's part of his skin). He now has light blue eyes in this form (a result of absorbing Android 17). He even has boot-like feet in this form and metal-like plates all around both of his ankles. He has the same shape of ears as Frieza's, except that his have an orange line that goes down to the chin and to both sides of the ears. His wings retreat completely into his back. In his self-destruction form, Semi-Perfect Cell bloats himself, his belly greatly expanding in size. He also claimed that his bloated appearance was unstable, and that a single touch may set him off when dissuading Gohan from trying to stop him.

In his "Perfect" form, Cell becomes much more humanoid and more intelligent, complete with both a fully-formed nose and mouth. His tail is retracted and now used to create Cell Jr's. He is also smaller than in his previous form. His wings have grown back and now are shaded black. His body is colored light-green with black spots and has black plates located on his shoulders and chest, and the plates on his ankles as well as the previously orange section near his groin are now shaded black. His skin is now pale all in his face, neck and hands, he now has purple lines in both sides of his cheeks, similar to Frieza in his first three forms, and the orange line across his ears and chin is now changed into a yellow color. His eyes are now pink, and his blue veins are now purple.

Medgar Evers

Medgar Wiley Evers (July 2, 1925June 12, 1963) was an American civil rights activist from Decatur Mississippi. He is best known for his work to overturn racial segregation in the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s. He was a World War II veteran. He became a field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). After the 1954 ruling of the United States Supreme Court in "Brown v. Board of Education" that segregated public schools were unconstitutional, Evers worked to get African Americans admitted to the all-white University of Mississippi. He also worked for other changes in the nation's then-segregated society, such as voting rights and registration, economic opportunity, and access to public facilities for African Americans.
Evers was assassinated by Byron De La Beckwith, a member of the “White Citizens' Council, a group formed in 1954 to resist integration of schools and civil rights activity in America. His murder and the resulting trials led to many civil rights protests. An all-white jury failed to convict De La Beckwith in his first two trials. He was finally convicted, however, 30 years later in a new state trial in 1994 that was based on new evidence. Evers’ wife Myrlie Evers, later became a noted activist in her own right, serving as national chair of the NAACP. His brother Charles Evers became the first African-American mayor elected in the state of Mississippi in 1969 in Fayette, Mississippi. 

Evers was the third of the five children born to Jesse (Wright) and James Evers. The family included his father Jesse's two children from a previous marriage. The Evers family owned a small farm, and his father also worked at a sawmill. Evers walked twelve miles to attend segregated schools, and earned his high school diploma. Evers served in the United States Army during World War II from 1943 to 1945. He fought in the Battle of Normandy in June 1944. After the end of the war, Evers was honorably discharged as a sergeant.

In 1948, Evers enrolled at Alcorn College, now Alcorn State University majoring in business administration. He also competed on the debate, football, and track teams, sang in the choir, and was junior class president. He earned his Bachelor of Arts in 1952. He married classmate Myrlie Beasley in 1951 while they were still in college. Together they had three children: Darrell Kenyatta, Reena Denise, and James Van Dyke Evers.The couple moved to Mound Bayou, Mississippi, a town that was founded by African Americans. There Evers became a salesman for T. R. M. Howard's Magnolia Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 1954, Evers applied to the segregated University of Mississippi Law School as a test case for the NAACP, but his application was rejected because of his race. In late 1954, Evers was named the NAACP's first field secretary for Mississippi. In this position, he helped organize boycotts and set up new local chapters of the NAACP. He was involved with James Meredith's efforts to enroll in the University of Mississippi in the early 1960s. Evers also helped Dr. Gilbert Mason, Sr., organize the Biloxi, Mississippi wade-ins, protests against segregation of public beaches on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.

Evers' civil rights work and leadership made him a target of white supremacists. His public investigations into the 1955 lynching of teenager Emmett Till had made him a prominent black leader. On May 28, 1963, a Molotov cocktail was thrown into the carport of his home. 
On June 12, 1963, Evers pulled into his driveway after returning from a meeting with NAACP lawyers. As he was getting out of his car he was shot in the back and the bullet passed through his heart. He was taken to a hospital in Jackson, Mississippi where he was first refused entry because of his race. After his family explained who he was, the hospital went on and admitted him. He died in the hospital about 50 minutes later.As a veteran, Evers was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.

Battle of Thebes

Thebes had been under Macedonian occupation since the battle of Chaeronea, which had resulted in the defeat and deposition of Thebes as the pre-eminent city-state of Southern Greece. The Thebans had reluctantly accepted this, as well as their compulsory membership in the League of Corinth, which had been previously imposed by Phillip II of Macedon, Alexander's father.

The expedition against Persia had been long in the works, and Alexander did not make it a secret that he planned to avenge the attacks on Greece by Persia a century and a half before, despite that at the time his kingdom had been a Persian vassal state. It was as a result of this planned expedition that King Darius III started to distribute money to the Greek city-states with the hope that they would rise against their new Hegemon. In addition to this, he had sent his most able general Memnon of Rhodes against the Macedonian troops that were already stationed in Ionia at this time.

In addition to this, news of Alexander had not reached the southern Greek city states for some time. He had been busy with the siege of Pelium and a rumour had reached them that he had died during the course of this siege. Demosthenes - a prominent Athenian politician - produced a man who claimed to have been present at the siege and claimed that Alexander was dead. Alexander had, indeed, been injured during this siege, so it was not a totally implausible claim to make.

Upon learning of the alleged death of Alexander, Theban exiles in Athens raced off to their native city in Boeotia and sought to incite a revolt from Macedonian rule there. The Cadmaea, the citadel that was situated upon a hill in Thebes, was occupied by a Macedonian garrison, and it was this place that the Thebans sought to attack. To this effect, they killed two Macedonian officers who had been roaming the city, and declared their independence from Macedonia.

Clothes iron

A clothes iron (also flatiron or smoothing iron) has a handle and a flat triangle shaped surface. Electricity makes the flat surface hot. A hot iron is rubbed on clothes to make them flat and smooth. This is called ironing. The handle does not get hot because that is where it is held. They are named clothes irons because they used to be made out of the metal iron.

Cloth is made from lots of small strings. When people wear clothes or move other things made from cloth, the little strings might bend and make lumps. Because the iron is heavy and hot when it is turned on, the little strings stretch and go flat when the iron is put on top. Different kinds of cloth need to be ironed in different ways. If the iron is too hot then the cloth might get broken or burn. If the iron is too cold then the strings might stay lumpy and not go flat. Sometimes people use water with an iron, which makes steam. This can make it easier to iron clothes because the small strings get soft. Some cloth does not need to be ironed because the strings always stays flat.

Some people think wearing clothes that have been ironed shows they are not lazy. Other people think that not ironing clothes can make them look nicer.

Win–loss record (pitching)

In baseball, a win–loss record shows the number of games that a pitcher has won and the number of games he has lost. In each game, one pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win (the "winning pitcher") and one pitcher on the losing team is given a loss (the "losing pitcher"). These pitchers are known as the pitchers of record. The awarding of a win or a loss for a pitcher is known as a "decision", and only one pitcher for each team receives a decision in each game. A starting pitcher who does not receive credit for a win or loss is said to have "no decision". In certain situations, another pitcher on the winning team who pitched in relief of the winning pitcher can be credited with a save, and holds can be awarded to relief pitchers on both sides, but these are never awarded to the same pitcher who is awarded the win.

Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident

The Wikipedia biography controversy, also known as the Seigenthaler incident, was a set of events that began in May 2005. Anonymous Wikipedia editors posted a hoax article in Wikipedia about John Seigenthaler. 

The article falsely stated that Seigenthaler had been a suspect in the deaths of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.

The then-78-year-old Seigenthaler, who was a friend of Robert Kennedy, described the Wikipedia article about him as "Internet character assassination".

The author of the hoax article was later identified as Brian Chase. On May 26, 2005, Chase added a new article that contained, in its entirety, the following text:

John Seigenthaler Sr. was the assistant to Attorney General Robert Kennedy in the early 1960s. For a short time, he was thought to have been directly involved in the Kennedy assassinations of both John, and his brother, Bobby. Nothing was ever proven.

John Seigenthaler moved to the Soviet Union in 1972, and returned to the United States in 1984.

He started one of the country's largest public relations firms shortly thereafter.
The hoax was not discovered and corrected until September 2005. Afterwards, Seigenthaler wrote about his experience in "USA Today". The incident raised questions about the and other websites with user-generated content that lack the legal accountability of traditional newspapers and published materials.

In a December 13 interview, co-founder Jimmy Wales expressed his support for Wikipedia policy allowing articles to be edited by anonymous users – describing the participation of editors in China and Iran in terms of privacy issues – but announced plans to roll back their article creation privileges as part of a vandalism-control strategy: "...we've decided that we want to slow down...so starting in January we're preventing unregistered users from creating new pages, because so often those have to be deleted...".

Qin Shi Huang

Qin Shi Huang (; 18 February 259 B.C. – 10 September 210 B.C.) was the founder of the Qin dynasty and was the first emperor of a unified China.

He was born Ying Zheng () or Zhao Zheng (), a prince of the state of Qin. He became the King Zheng of Qin () when he was thirteen, then China's first emperor when he was 38 after the Qin had ruled all of the other Warring States and unified all of China in 221 BC.

The First Emperor's father Yiren was the grandson of Ze, the ruler of Qin. The rulers of Qin and Zhao were from the same family, but the two lands fought against one another frequently. They wanted to make peace. King Ze gave his grandson Yiren to the leaders of Zhao so that, if Qin started to fight Zhao, the ruler of Zhao would kill Yiren and his family. Because King Ze would not want that, the ruler of Zhao was able to have less fear that Qin would fight him. (He also sent people from his family as prisoners to Qin so that things were even.)

While Yiren was a prisoner in Zhao, he met a trader named Lü Buwei. Lü knew that, when King Ze went to death, Yiren's father Lord Anguo would be the leader of Qin. Lü also knew that Yiren had many brothers but Yiren's father loved a woman who had no son. Lü worked hard to make that woman adopt Yiren (take him up as her son); Yiren even changed his name to Zichu ("son of Chu") because his new "mother" was from a land named Chu. Lü's design turned out well: he and Zichu secretly went out from Zhao and, when King Ze and Lord Anguo died, Zichu got to be the ruler of Qin.

The ruler of Zhao was angry but Zheng's mother hid. He was not able to kill her or her son. Zheng's mother had been the girlfriend of Lü Buwei, but Lü gave her to Yiren when he fell in love with her. Sima Qian was not certain that Zheng was the son of Zichu and not the son of Lü Buwei, but most people thought that he was the son of Zichu, ruler of Qin. When Zichu died, Zheng got to be the new ruler of Qin. Because he was still very young when this took place, his mother and Lü Buwei were the true rulers.

Later, Zheng was older and put Lü Buwei and his mother's new boyfriend to death. He put his mother away as a prisoner as well. Now, Zheng and his helper Li Si ruled Qin. Their ideas are called Legalism. It said that the old ways of doing things were not good: if everyone did as ordered by the ruler and by his laws, things would be much better. The best way to run a country was for the ruler to have all the power. That way, no one would be able to fight or hurt other people. As the ruler of Qin, Zheng liked these ideas; as the ruler of China, he said they would be the only ideas. He made Confucianism and other old ideas against the law. Only the library in his palace (great house) was able to have books with any old ideas or with other people's accounts of history. Everyone else would have to read about Legalism and the accounts of history approved by the Emperor. The First Emperor's men then burned the other books and even killed some of the men who tried to keep them by burying them (putting them under the earth).

As the ruler of China, the First Emperor ordered great undertakings: his men put together earlier bits into a Great Wall of China and made a new river—the Lingqu Canal—so that boats were able to go from the Yangtze River in the middle of China to the Pearl River in the south. He ordered a large number of new roads and a tomb (last resting place) for himself the size of a city. This resting place was looked after by the thousands of statues of the Terracotta Army. Many people did not like doing as the First Emperor ordered: Sima Qian wrote about three men who made attempts to kill the First Emperor. None of them were successful.

The First Emperor did not want to die. He went to Shandong and Jiangsu to look for people who would be able to make him live forever. No one was able to do that, but some people think that Xu Fu's journeys to look for Mount Penglai were important for Japan. This was about the time Japan's early Jōmon period ended and its Yayoi period started. The Yayoi period was the start of farming and the start of large countries in Japan. The First Emperor died in 210  BC.

The First Emperor had many sons, but his helpers Li Si and Zhao Gao tricked Fusu, his most liked son into killing himself. That way, a younger son became the Second Emperor and Li Si and Zhao Gao was able to be the true rulers for a while. The time when the First Emperor's family ruled China is named the Qin Dynasty, but it was very short. After the Qin Dynasty, there was more fighting before Liu Bei came out on top and got to be the new ruler of China. His family was named the Han Dynasty.

IFOR

The Implementation Force (IFOR) was a NATO-led multinational peace enforcement force in Bosnia and Herzegovina under a one-year mandate from 20 December 1995 to 20 December 1996 under the codename "Operation Joint Endeavour".

NATO was responsible for carrying out the Dayton Peace Accords. The Dayton Peace Accords were started on November 22, 1995 by the presidents of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia, on behalf of Serbia and the Bosnian Serb Republic. The actual signing happened in Paris on December 14, 1995. The peace accords contained a General Framework Agreement and eleven supporting annexes with maps. The accords had three major goals: ending of hostilities, authorization of military and civilian program going into effect, and the establishment of a central Bosnian government while excluding individuals that serve sentences or under indictment by the International War Crimes Tribunals from taking part in the running of the government. IFOR's specific role was to implement the military Annexes of "The General Framework Agreement for Peace (GFAP) in Bosnia and Herzegovina".

IFOR relieved the UN peacekeeping force UNPROFOR, which had originally arrived in 1992, and the transfer of authority was discussed in Security Council Resolution 1031. Almost 60,000 NATO soldiers in addition to forces from non-NATO nations were deployed to Bosnia. Operation Decisive Endeavor (SACEUR OPLAN 40105), beginning 6 December 1995, was a subcomponent of Joint Endeavor.

The Dayton Agreement resulted from a long series of events. Notably, the failures of EU-led peace plans, the August 1995 Croat Operation Storm and its aftermath, the Bosnian Serb atrocities, in particular the Srebrenica massacre, and the seizure of UNPROFOR peace-keepers as human shields against NATO's Operation Deliberate Force.

Admiral Leighton W. Smith, Jr. (Commander in Chief Allied Forces Southern Europe (CINCSOUTH)) acted as the Joint Force Commander for the operation (also known as "Commander IFOR" (COMIFOR)). He commanded the operation from HQs in Zagreb and later from March 1996 from the Residency in Sarajevo. Lt Gen Michael Walker, Commander Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) acted as the Land Component Commander for the Operation, commanding from HQ ARRC (Forward) based initially in Kiseljak and from late January 1996 from HQ ARRC (Main) Ilidža. This was NATO's first ever out-of-area land deployment. The Land Component's part of the operation was known as Operation Firm Endeavour.

At its height, IFOR involved troops from 32 countries and numbered some 54,000 soldiers in-country (BiH) and around 80,000 involved soldiers in total (with support and reserve troops stationed in Croatia, Hungary, Germany, and Italy and also on ships in the Adriatic Sea). In the initial phases of the operation, much of the initial composition of IFOR consisted of units which had been part of UNPROFOR but remained in place and simply replaced their United Nations insignia with IFOR insignia.

There is no iron in ironstone. Its name is got because it is strong and durable. Ironstone was developed in the 19th century by potters in Staffordshire. It sold well as a cheaper alternative to porcelain.

Ironstone in Britain's Staffordshire potteries was made by Charles James Mason after his patent of 1813. The name "ironstone" later became generally used. The strength of Mason's ironstone enabled the company to produce ornamental objects of large size. Their vestibule vaseswere 1.5 metres high. Mantelpieces were made from several large sections. Mason's tableware was widely used in hotels and restaurants as well as private homes. It was usual for commercial clients to have the name of their establishment transfer printed onto the stoneware. 

Mason's was not the only manufacturer. Another high-class pottery was Spode, who made ironstone from 1805 onwards. They had big exports to France, where ironstone was often preferred to faience pottery.

During the mid-19th century The United states was the largest export market for Staffordshire's potteries. They bought plain white stoneware in huge quantities.

Antique ironstone wares are collectable, and in particular items made by Mason's.

During World War II he was confined by the Nazi regime to a Jewish ghetto. His children died in the ghetto, but he and his wife were deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp. Kristal survived the Holocaust, but his wife did not. He remarried shortly after the War and, in 1950, emigrated to Haifa, Israel, with his second wife Batsheva, also a survivor of the Holocaust, and their infant child, and lived in Haifa until his death at age 113 years, 330 days.

Mbah Gotho

Saparman Sodimejo, popularly known as Mbah Gotho, was an Indonesian man who gained attention for his claim of having lived over 140 years. Although there is no conclusive evidence to verify his exact age, The Indonesian Government reportedly recognised him as one of the oldest individuals based on an issued ID card.

Mbah Gotho's recollection of his birth date was uncertain, but he vividly remembered the construction of a sugar factory in 1890. In 2010, local authorities registered him as being over 140 years old, and in 2014, he was issued an ID card with a recorded birth date of 1870.

It is worth noting that the oldest person with documented evidence of their age is Jeanne Calment, who lived to the age of 122 years before passing away.

In May 2010, "Solopos" reported that the census had recorded his next birthday as his 142nd. That would have made him 19 years older than the oldest recorded person, Jeanne Calment, was when she died in 1997.

The "Liputan 6" website reported that Mbah Gotho's estimated age was 140. He could not remember his date of birth, but claimed to remember the construction of a sugar factory built in Sragen in 1890.

In August 2016, after a television report on Liputan 6, numerous international media outlets reported Gotho's claim. They then showed photographs of his ID card (issued in 2014), which displays his claimed birth date. 

Although Indonesian officials at the local record office confirmed the birth date there is no independent proof of his claimed age. That would have been required for the claim about the age to be recognised by record authorities, such as Guinness World Records. The Indonesian government did not register births before 1900, and there have been errors in the past.

The Gerontology Research Group commented that this extremely high claimed age was "fiction" and "unbelievable". The story on Liputan 6 noted other similar claims about age. That included a woman named "Maemunah" and known as "Ambu Unah", who had been claimed to be born in 1867, in Cimanuk, Pandeglang Regency.

On 28 April 2017 Mbah Gotho was admitted to RSUD Hospital for heart failure in Sragen and died two days later at 5:45 pm local time on 30 April 2017.

According to the BBC, he outlived ten siblings, four wives, and all of his children.

Faisal Arefin Dipan (Bengali: ফয়সাল আরেফিন দীপন)(c. 1972 - 31 October 2015) was a Bangladeshi book publisher of the Jagriti Prokashoni publishing house. He was hacked to death inside his house in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital.

Deepan was a secular book publisher who printed writing that discussed topics like atheism and sexual orientation. He had received death threats from religious extremists. He published books by Bangladeshi-American writer and blogger Avijit Roy who was the four secular bloggers killed in Bangladesh the same year. Dipan's father said his company had published Avajit Roy's 2014 book, Biswasher Virus (The Virus of Faith).

An hour earlier, another publisher and two writers were attacked, but they survived. A local al-Qaeda group said they were responsible for the attack. Ahmed Rahim Tutal, a secular publisher, was attacked in his office at the Shudhdhoswar publishing house.

British politicians condemned the murder. British bishop Declan Lang, the chair of the international affairs department of the British bishops' conference, said that the Roman Catholic community in England and Wales should "speak out when people are imprisoned, tortured or killed on account of their atheism." Eric Adriaans, the National Executive Director of Centre For Inquiry Canada said that Canada should offer asylum to people targeted by religious extremists.

The International Publishers Association honored Deepan at their annual conference and called on the United Nations to do more about freedom of expression in Bangladesh. Tutul sent a message to the conference, saying: "If Jagriti Faisal Abedin Deepan were alive today, he would play an important role in this conference. But because he published free-thinking books, Islamist fundamentalists killed him. I urge all my publisher friends to continue to publish the works of free thinkers. I believe this is the best reply to the fundamentalists. By increasing the number of people that free-thinking books can reach, we'll be able to weaken fundamentalism in Bangladesh." Tutal also called for freedom for Bangladeshi writer and publisher, Shamsuzzoha Manik. Manik was arrested under a Bangladeshi law that prohibits criticism of religion. Manik is 73 years old and published a titled "Islam Bitorko" ("Debate on Islam").

Although not officially linked to a any denomination, Wilkerson can be considered a Pentecostal in teachings and practice.

Wilkerson was a pastor in Pennsylvania. Around 1960 he started a ministry in New York City to help and evangelize teenagers, who were involved in drugs and crime. In 1960, he founded for that reason the Christian relief organization Teen Challenge. With the Sherrills he wrote a book about his experiences called "The Cross and the Switchblade" (1962).

Some years later, in 1967, he founded Youth Crusades, again aimed at teenagers but this time to prevent them from the bad things mentioned above. 

In 1971, he founded again a Christian organization, World Challenge, to evangelize worldwide.

In 1987, he erected the Times Square Church, an independent and very succesful church in Manhattan, New York City.

Wilkerson wrote several Christian books, like the already mentioned "The Cross and the Switchblade" (1962) and the very impressive "The Vision" (1974). Last book and its successor ("The Vision and Beyond", 2003) are dealing with divine prophecies about severe misconduct, problems and disasters the world is facing in the future (and already partly happening); he also revealed that the so-called "Number of the Beast" (Antichrist) will be composed of a combination of three times six numbers. He also wrote about other divine prophecies such as riots and arsons cities in the United States (especially New York City) but also worldwide are going to endure in the future because of their sinful behavior, and countries going bankrupt causing shopping and money problems worldwide.

David Wilkerson died as a result of a car accident in eastern Texas in 2011, aged nearly 80.

Ramjet

A ramjet is a type of jet engine which uses the forward motion of the engine to produce thrust. Ramjets are most often attached to aircraft, and require that the aircraft is moving above the speed of sound (Mach 1). They are different from turbojets ("normal" aircraft engines) because they do not have any moving parts which compress the air. Instead, they use a shock cone to compress the air. The ramjet gets its name from this fact; it "rams" the air hard enough to compress it to a combustible pressure.

Ramjets are made up of 4 main sections.

The first section is called the inlet. The purpose of the inlet is to capture air and compress it. Compression is required in order to burn the fuel correctly. The compression comes from a process called a shock wave. Shock waves only occur when the aircraft is moving at or above Mach 1. For this reason, ramjets are more efficient if moving around Mach 2 or 3. 

The second part of the ramjet is called the diffuser. Air that comes through the inlet is moving very fast, which makes it very hard to burn fuel. The job of the diffuser is to slow the flow down in an efficient way. By the time the air has passed all the way through the inlet, it is traveling slower than Mach 1. This is important for the diffuser to work properly. The diffuser is essentially just a pipe that increases in area as you move along it. Because the flow moving slower than Mach 1, the increasing area causes the air to slow down.

The third part of the ramjet is the combustor, also called the combustion chamber. The combustor is where the fuel is introduced to the air, and then burns. Burning fuel adds energy to the air, which will be later used to create thrust. The air must be moving relatively slowly for the combustor to work properly. There is a part inside the combustor called the flame holder. The flame holder, as the name suggests, holds the flame in place. A typical flame holder looks like a ring of small v-shaped pieces of metal. They create little pockets of slow air, which make it easier for the fuel to keep burning.

After the fuel is burned and the air is heated, it flows through the last part, the nozzle. The purpose of the nozzle is to turn all of the energy in the air into thrust. In order to do this, the nozzle must first get smaller then get larger. The smallest area of the nozzle is called the "throat". The air coming from the combustor is moving slower than Mach 1, so as the nozzle gets smaller, the air speeds up. The nozzle is designed so that once the air reaches the throat, it has sped all the way up to Mach 1. This is an important detail for the nozzle to work properly. Once the air passes the throat, the air gets larger again. Since the flow reached Mach 1 in the throat, increasing the area also increases the speed of the air. This is the key to creating thrust. The air exiting the nozzle essentially "pushes" the ramjet forward.

Cryotherapy

Cryotherapy is using a freezing chamber (usually -110 degrees) to help muscles recover. Cyrotherapy is said to multiple applications. The word "Cryo" comes from Greek language, which means icy or cold. Cryotherapy is a procedure that exposes the body to temperatures colder than -200 degrees for about 3 minutes.

Cryotherapy is also used to treat cancer, wherein, extreme cold temperatures destroy cancer cells which is made due to cryotherapy chambers. 

James von Brunn

James Wenneker von Brunn (July 11, 1920 – January 6, 2010) was an American man who perpetrated the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum shooting in Washington, D.C. on June 10, 2009. Security guard Stephen Tyrone Johns was killed in the shooting, and von Brunn was wounded by two security guards who returned fire. Von Brunn was named the prime suspect in the shooting, and was charged with first-degree murder and firearms violations. While awaiting trial, von Brunn died on January 6, 2010.
Von Brunn was a white supremacist, neo-Nazi and Holocaust denier who had written numerous antisemitic essays, created an antisemitic website called "The Holy Western Empire", and is the author of a 1999 self-published book, "Kill the Best Gentiles", which praises Adolf Hitler and denies the Holocaust, including propagating the belief of a supposed white genocide. After the shooting, traces of his personal writings and works online were deleted from many websites, including AskArt.com, FreeRepublic and his personal user page on Wikipedia where he was indefinitely blocked, the latter said to constitute "a violation of policy of hate speech". He also made posts expressing his opposition to the Iraq War, and felt that the September 11 attacks were an "inside job".
Von Brunn was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the first of two children. His father was a native of Houston, Texas, and a superintendent at the Scullin Steel Mill in Houston during World War II. His mother was a piano teacher and homemaker.
Von Brunn enrolled in Washington University in St. Louis in August 1938, and received his Bachelor of Science degree in journalism in April 1943. During his time at the university, von Brunn was said to have been president of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter, and a varsity football player. He served in the United States Navy from 1943 to 1957, and was the commanding officer of PT boat 159 during the Pacific Theatre of World War II, receiving a commendation and three battle stars. Von Brunn had worked as an advertising executive and producer in New York City for twenty years. In the late 1960s, he relocated to the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where he continued to do advertising work and resumed painting.
In the early 1970s, Von Brunn briefly worked for Noontide Press, the publishing arm of the Holocaust-denying Institute for Historical Review.
Von Brunn's arrest history dates back at least as far as the middle 1960s. In 1968, he received a six-month jail sentence in Maryland for fighting with a sheriff during an incident at the county jail. He had earlier been arrested for driving under the influence following an altercation at a local restaurant in 1966.
Von Brunn was arrested in 1981 for attempted kidnapping and hostage-taking of members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors after approaching the Federal Reserve's Eccles Building armed with a revolver, knife, and sawed-off shotgun. Von Brunn later described his actions as a "citizen's arrest for treason." He reportedly complained of "high interest rates" during the incident and was disarmed without any shots being fired, after threatening a security guard with a .38 caliber pistol. He reportedly claimed he had a bomb, which was found to be only a device designed to look like a bomb. He was convicted in 1983 for burglary, assault, weapons charges, and attempted kidnapping. Von Brunn's sentence was completed by September 15, 1989, after he had served six and a half years in prison. After he was released he successfully tested for and joined Mensa International; however, he was eventually dropped from membership for failing to pay his annual dues.
Von Brunn was a member of the American Friends of the British National Party, a group that raised funds in the United States for the far right and "rights for whites" British National Party (BNP). The group had been addressed on at least two occasions by Nick Griffin, an ex-member of the National Front and chairman of the BNP. A BNP spokesperson claimed after the shooting that the party had "never heard of" von Brunn.
In 2004 and 2005 he lived in Hayden Lake, Idaho, the town where Aryan Nations—a neo-Nazi organization led by Richard Butler—was based until 2001. Von Brunn was living in Annapolis, Maryland at the time of the 2009 incident.
After the shooting, federal authorities raided his apartment and seized a rifle, ammunition, computers, a handwritten will, and a painting of Jesus Christ standing adjacent to Adolf Hitler. The FBI also stated it discovered child pornography on one of the seized computers.
Von Brunn was charged in federal court on June 11, 2009, with first-degree murder and firearms violations; he pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. On July 29, 2009, von Brunn was indicted on seven counts, including four which made him eligible for the death penalty. In September 2009, a judge ordered von Brunn to undergo a competency evaluation to determine whether or not he could stand trial.
Von Brunn had the Federal Bureau of Prisons ID# 07128-016 and was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Complex in Butner, North Carolina. On January 6, 2010, von Brunn died in a hospital located near the prison. According to a statement by his attorney, von Brunn had "a long history of poor health," including sepsis and chronic congestive heart failure.

The Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C. condemned the attack. President Barack Obama said, "This outrageous act reminds us that we must remain vigilant against anti-Semitism and prejudice in all its forms."
The Southern Poverty Law Center, Anti-Defamation League, and FBI stated they had been monitoring von Brunn's internet postings, but were unable to take action because his comments had not crossed the line from free speech into advocating violence.
On June 11, 2009, the Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) of Greater Washington and the InterFaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington led a prayer vigil which took place in front of the museum. Organizers said the vigil was a time to honor Stephen Johns, the slain officer, as well as a time to reflect upon the motivations which led to the shooting spree. Approximately 100 people attended the event, including officials from the Israeli and German embassies. The Council on American–Islamic Relations condemned the attack as well. When the museum reopened on June 12, 2009, Director Sara Bloomfield said attendance was normal or even higher than usual. Many visitors said their attendance was a statement against hate and intolerance. A 17-year-old girl who was in the museum the day of the shooting stated, "It's important to come back, because if you don't, they win. It's a form of terrorism."
In a statement, von Brunn's son, Erik, expressed sorrow and horror about the shooting. In an article he wrote for ABC News, he stated:

The younger von Brunn, who was 32 at the time of the 2009 shooting, did not meet his father until he was nearly 11 years old, after the elder von Brunn completed his prison term for the Federal Reserve incident.

A witch persuaded Eliaures, who was a magician, to make the snake attach itself to Caradoc's arm, sucking his blood. His friend Cador saved his life by putting his sister Guimer in a vat of milk and Caradoc in a vat of sour wine.
