Acid Survivors Foundation

The Acid Survivors Foundation is a Bangladeshi organization that helps victims of acid attacks and tries to prevent these attacks..

It was founded in 1999 with support from UNICEF and the Canadian International Development Agency. In 2005 the co-founder Monira Rahman was granted the Human Rights Award of Amnesty International. 



Shmuel Yosef Agnon

Shmuel Yosef Agnon (July 17, 1888 – February 17, 1970) was an Israeli writer and winner of the 1966 Nobel Prize in Literature.

He was one of the central figures of modern Hebrew fiction. In Hebrew, he is known by the acronym Shai Agnon. In English, his works are published under the name S. Y. Agnon.


Acid throwing

Acid throwing or vitriolage is a form of violent assault. Sometimes the crime is called acid attack. The attackers throw acid or other corrosive substances at their victims. Usually they throw it at the targets' faces. They want to damage skin tissue, even to expose and to dissolve the bones. The consequences of these attacks include blindness and permanent scars of the face and body.

In India, the number of acid attacks have been rising. There had been 68 acid attacks in Karnataka alone (of which Bengaluru is the capital) since 1999. These are only the cases that have been reported. Unlike India, Bangladesh has introduced the death penalty for throwing acid and laws strictly controlling the sales of acids since 2002. An important role for the introduction of that legislation had the Acid Survivors Foundation.

Acid throwing is a crime in most countries in the world. Many Islamic countries have the concept of qisas, or retributive justice. With this, a victim can ask that the attacker be disfigured in a similar way. That way, an Iranian court ordered that the attacker of a woman who was blinded by such an attack, be blinded as well.

According to researchers and activists, countries with many occurrences of acid attacks include Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, United Kingdom, Kenya, South Africa, Uganda, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Acid attacks have been reported however in countries around the world, including:

Additionally, evidence for acid attacks exists in other regions of the world such as South America, Central and North Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. However, South Asian countries maintain the highest incidence of acid attacks.

Police in the United Kingdom have noted that many victims are scared to come forward to report attacks, meaning the nobody knows how many attacks have happened.

White nose syndrome

White nose syndrome (WNS) is a condition which has caused many bats in the United States and Canada to die. The condition is named "white nose" because the affected bats have a fungus around their nose which is white. It was discovered in February 2006.

The disease was first reported in January 2007 in some New York caves. It spread to other New York caves and into Vermont, Massachusetts and Connecticut in 2008. In early 2009 it was found in New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. West Virginia In March 2010, it was found in Ontario, Canada, and Middle Tennessee. In 2012, new cases showed up in northeastern Ohio, and Acadia National Park in Maine. New confirmed cases appeared in 2013 in Georgia, South Carolina, and Illinois.

British National Party

The British National Party (or BNP for short) is a far-right and fascist political party in the United Kingdom. The party was led by Nick Griffin from 1999 until 2014 and the current leader of the BNP is Adam Walker.

In 2009, the party had 2 MEPs (Members of European Parliament) out of 73 British seats in the European Parliament. Those two seats were held by Griffin and Andrew Brons. It has no seats in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom or the devolved assemblies. 

The BNP was started in 1982 by John Tyndall (politician).

In November 2012 the British Democratic Party was started by Brons. Brons started the party after leaving the BNP in October 2012. Brons wants the BDP to end the BNP. He does not like the BNP because he thinks its ideology is not extreme enough. Griffin lost his seat in the European Parliament in 2014.

Road number

A road number is usually given to a portion of public roadway. The chosen number often depends on the type of road. The numbers will be different if the road is an interstate, a motorway, an arterial thoroughfare, a two-lane road, and so forth.

In the United Kingdom, the route number has a letter and a number. It is between 1 and 4 digits/numbers long. For instance, the main road from London to Edinburgh is called the A1. The "A" means it is a first class route. This also means it is more important than "B" roads. The A2, A3, A4, A5, A6 begin in London and go towards various towns around the coast. Roads which start in the area between the A1 and the A2 must start with the number 1 (A137, B1412), etc. Scotland is also divided into zones by the A7, A8 and A9 leave from Edinburgh. Motorways have the letter "M", for example the M25. Motorways have a different numbering system from "A" and "B" roads. 

This system is used in other European countries (for example, Spain and France).

Russian Social Democratic Labour Party

The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) was a Russian political party. 

The party was founded in 1898. Its program was based on Marxism and socialism. The party wanted to lead the workers of Russia and to get rid of the Tsar.

Some members of the party wanted democracy and were called "Mensheviks".

Other members of the party spoke for the dictatorship of the working class and were called "Bolsheviks". The leaders of the Mensheviks were Martov and Potresov. The leaders of the Bolshevik group were Plekhanov and Lenin.

The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was an illegal party. It fought against the autocracy, organized meetings and strikes, and printed illegal newspapers blaming the Tsar and his government. Many members of the party were arrested, put into prison, or condemned to penal servitude.

In 1917 Lenin and most other Bolsheviks became a separate political party, RSDLP(B), which later became the Russian Communist Party.

During the Russian Civil War, the RSDLP was banned by the communists. Some social democrats became Communists, others fled from Russia, and still others became political prisoners.

Signed number representations

Signed Number representations are used to solve the problem of representing negative integers in binary. The problem of trying to store the negative sign (−) of a binary number is that there are no states left to use with which to represent the negative assignment. It is not possible to just use 'off' for minus and 'on' for plus because the computer would have no way of knowing whether it was a digit or a sign.

To overcome this issue computer designers invented two methods for storing negative binary numbers: sign-and-magnitude and 2's complement. These produce alternative representations for signed numbers.

Sign and Magnitude works by changing the most significant bit (MSB - the first digit) to a 1 if the number is negative, and reduce the number by one, for example:

will become...

This method of storing negative binary numbers does not work because binary arithmetic won't work.

1's Complement works by swapping 1s for 0s and the 0s for 1s for example:
will become...

Much like the sign-and-magnitude method this is easily defined as a negative number because its most significant bit is 1

2's Complement is a more difficult way of storing negatives. There are four steps for it:


This method is liked because:


Kingpin (character)

The Kingpin (Wilson Grant Fisk) is a fictional character in the Marvel Universe. The character first appears in "The Amazing Spider-Man" #50 (July 1967), and was created by writer Stan Lee and artist John Romita, Sr. The Kingpin often appears as an adversary of Spider-Man, Daredevil and the Punisher.


Kingpin is the main antagonist of both the 2003 movie "Daredevil" played by Michael Clarke Duncan and the 2015 Netflix original television series "Daredevil" set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in which he is played by Vincent D'Onofrio. D'Onofrio played Kingpin in the 2021 Disney+ series "Hawkeye", the 2024 series "Echo," and will reprised the role in the upcoming television series "". Kingpin is also the villain of the animated movie . 

Centre Pompidou-Metz

The Centre Pompidou Metz is a museum of modern and contemporary art. It is in Metz, France. It shows sculptures, modern and contemporary paintings and graphic art.

The architecture of the building is inspired by a traditional Chinese hat. The carpentry is an innovative assembly made of sixteen kilometers of wood.

Some elements of the inaugural exhibition were borrow by the Centre Georges Pompidou of Paris, especially:


Floating point

Real numbers in binary have to be stored in a special way in a computer. Computers represent numbers as binary integers (whole numbers that are powers of two), so there is no direct way for them to represent non-integer numbers like decimals as there is no radix point. One way computers bypass this problem is floating-point representation, with "floating" referring to how the radix point can move higher or lower when multiplied by an exponent (power).

In mathematics and science, very large and very small numbers are often made simpler and multiplied to a power of ten to make them easier to understand. For example, it can be much easier to read 1.2 trillion as formula_1 than 1,200,000,000,000. This can also be used with negative powers of ten to make small numbers, meaning you can represent 0.000001 as formula_2. This process is called scientific notation.

Since computers are limited to integers and binary, this means they cannot easily represent fractional decimal numbers. In order to represent fractional numbers, computers use three sets of binary numbers to make a scientific notation representation. They are: the signed bit, which determines if the number is positive (0) or negative (1); the significand, which is an integer (whole) version of the number; and the exponent, which is the power you multiply the base by.

The significand is found by taking your number and moving the radix point until there is no fractional part, making it into an integer. In decimal this is making 1.45 into 145 by moving the point right 2 steps, and in binary this would be making 1101.0111 (13.4375) into 1101 0111 (215) by moving the point right 4 steps; in both cases these numbers aren't related to one another outside using the same digits in a similar ordering.

Similarly to how scientific notation makes the significand as basic as possible, the aim in floating point numbers is to make it an integer so it can be represented in bytes and used in calculations.

The exponent is the number of digits the radix point has moved past: if it moves left then the exponent is negative, but if it moves right then it is positive. As above, making 1.45 into 145 requires you to multiply by 100, so the exponent is 2 as formula_3. Equally, turning 1101.0111 (13.4375) into 1101 0111 (215) requires you to move the radix point four columns to the right, so the exponent is 4; this can be verified in decimal as formula_4.

Since the process is inverted to most cases of scientific notation, as it involves making a fraction into an integer rather than turning a large integer into a fraction, exponents are generally negative to move the decimal place to the left; in decimal this would be turning your integer 145 back into the fractional number 1.45 by multiplying it by formula_5. Instead of using an signed leftmost bit the exponent is instead biased, giving 32-bit float exponents a range of formula_6 to formula_7. The output value of the biased exponent can be found by adding 127 to it:

formula_8

formula_9

formula_10

Let's assume, for example, we want to represent the decimal number 37.40625 to its binary counterpoint: a bicimal (or binary decimal/fraction). First, we need to take our decimal number, which is in powers of 10, and convert it to binary, which is in powers of 2. One way to do this is to subtract the largest power of two possible until you reach zero:

formula_11

formula_12

formula_13

formula_14

formula_15

formula_16

Using the powers of two above, we can represent our decimal number formula_17 as follows:

We have validated that our decimal number formula_17 is represented in binary as formula_19. However, the issue with computers is that they represent numbers as integer powers of two using bits, which makes fractional and negative numbers complicated. In accordance with IEEE-754, the way this is commonly done with a computer is to create a 32-bit floating point number that consists of three parts:


Since we need to move our bicimal point 5 places to make formula_20 into the significand formula_21 our exponent is formula_22. By using a 32-bit float we can represent 37.40625 like this:


South Petherton

South Petherton is a small town in Somerset, a county in England. Over 4, 000 people live there. 
It is twinned with the town of Javané, which is in France. 
There are two schools in South Petheton: South Petherton Infants School, which is run by the Church of England and is for children from the age of 4 to 7, and South Petherton Junior School, which is for children aged 7 to 11.

Markup language

A markup language is a computer language. It is made up of a set of instructions, and of data. It is not the same as a programming language, as only programming languages can have "if" statements and other conditional statements. The first markup languages were used for printing; there was the text, and there were instructions how the text should be printed. The source code is generally done in ASCII. Then there are tags. That way, LaTeX (and with that, Wikipedia), uses the instruction <nowiki>\mu</nowiki> to get the symbol formula_1, the Greek letter "Mu". HTML uses <nowiki>&micro;</nowiki> to get the same symbol.

Alan Davies

Alan Davies (born 6 March 1966) is an English comedian, writer and actor. He is best known for starring in Jonathan Creek and for being a panellist on QI.

Davies was born in Loughton, Essex. His childhood years were spent in Chingford, London. Davies' mother died when he was six. He graduated in Drama from the University of Kent in 1988.

In 2008, Davies was in the teen comedy "Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging".

Davies' first book, the autobiographical "My Favourite People and Me, 1978-88", was published by Penguin Books in late 2009.

Davies married writer Katie Maskell on 13 January 2007 after a 6-month engagement. The couple met backstage at "QI" in 2005. Their first child, Susie, was born on 9 December 2009. Their second child, Robert, was born on 18 June 2011.

In late 2007 he made UK national news. "The Times" and "Daily Telegraph" reported that Davies was involved in a fight and bit the ear of a homeless man. Davies had just left a wake at the nearby Groucho Club. Davies is no longer allowed at the Groucho Club.

Davies is a fan of Arsenal F.C. and a season ticket holder.

Ponzi scheme

A Ponzi scheme is a special kind of fraud. It is based on a fake investment that one schemer (or group of schemers) gets other people to give money to.

In Ponzi schemes, the schemer basically says, "I found a great way to make money fast. The more you give me, the more I can invest in that cause, and the more I can earn for us all". But a Ponzi scheme doesn't actually "earn money". Instead, "all" of the scheme's money comes from the investors.

Once a Ponzi scheme gets too many investors, the system will always crash. This is because the investors all expect more money than they invested, and they will get impatient.

These schemes always stop one of three ways:

The scheme was named after a man named Charles Ponzi. He used the scheme after moving from Italy to the United States in 1903. (Ponzi didn't invent the scheme, though. In 1857, Charles Dickens wrote a book called "Little Dorrit" about a scheme like this. The scheme is a simple idea, and probably very old.) However, Ponzi's scheme was so big that it became the most popular. His original scheme was based on using countries' money-exchange rates to make money, based on international postage stamps. But money soon stopped being invested in coupons, and went to early investors, and a lot to Ponzi himself. 

Ponzi schemes can be run anywhere, even online, and are being run even now.

People advertising Ponzi schemes often use impressive words, that are actually very vague. Examples are:
Schemers often depend on investors "not actually knowing" about economics. The Madoff scandal of 2008 showed that even sophisticated people like bankers can fall for them. People are fooled by the schemer seeming to have financial skill or reputation. 

Sometimes, the schemers claim that money can only be made if the investment is kept a secret (away from the authorities or public). For example, Bernard Madoff only allowed the accounting firm run by his brother-in-law to perform audits on his "hedge fund", claiming it had to be kept a secret to earn money. 

Since the investment is very vague, not many investors come very fast. But the scheme often gets speed like this:

Schemers often try to tempt the early investors to "re-invest" the money they've "earned". Schemers sometimes send investors "invoices", showing investors how much they've "earned" and how much they'll keep "earning" if they keep "investing".

Schemers also try to make sure new investors can't take their money back, by making the rules tighter. In this case, the schemer will often have a few investors say they kept their money, making the investment still look productive enough to be good.








Baní

The Dominican city of Baní is the head municipality of the Peravia province, on the south of the country, close to the Caribbean Sea.

Baní is a Taíno word meaning "ebony" or a similar tree, but the city takes the name from the small river that flows through the city.

In 1764, the people that were living in the Peravia Valley bought some land in "Cerro Gordo" (part of the valley) to build a new town. The new town was given the name of Baní after the river that is found to the east of the town.

After the independence from Haiti in 1844, the country was divided in five provinces and in 1845 Baní was made a municipality of the old province of Santo Domingo. In 1944, Baní was made the capital city of the new province José Trujillo Valdéz, now with the name of Peravia.

The municipality had, in , a total population of 92,153: 44,841 men and 47,312 women. The urban population was of the total population.

Baní has a total area of (without including its municipal districts), about of the total area of the small province of Peravia. The city is an elevation of , and at to the west of Santo Domingo.

The western and northern part of the municipality (and of the province) has many mountains that are part of the "Cordillera Central" ("Central mountain range"); this range is called here "Sierra de Ocoa".

To the northeast of the city, there is a small karstic region with small cone-shaped hills that are called here as "cucuruchos".

In the southern half of the municipality there are several small valleys and savannas such as the Peravia Valley, where the city of Baní is located, and "Sabana de Paya" (Paya savanna) around the town of Paya.

West of Baní, the region is very dry and there are not many people living here except close to rivers and to the coast.

The most important rivers in this municipality are Ocoa and Baní rivers.

The municipality of Baní has the Azua province to the west, the San José de Ocoa to the north, the San Cristóbal province to the west and the municipality of Nizao to the southwest. To the south is the Caribbean Sea.

Baní has a tropical wet and dry savanna climate (Köppen climate classification : Aw) with a pronounced dry season in winter.

The average amount of rainfall for the year in the city is . The month with the most precipitation on average is October with of rainfall, followed by June with .

The driest season is winter. The month with the least rainfall on average is March with an average of and the second is January with .

Baní is in a hot region; the average temperature for the year is . The warmest month, on average, is July with an average temperature of . The coolest month on average is January, with an average temperature of .

The municipality of Baní has nine municipal districts:

Mikhail Sholokhov

Mikhail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov (; – 21 February 1984) was a Russian writer. He won the 1965 Nobel Prize in Literature.

Sholokhov was accused of plagiarizing "And Quiet Flows the Don", which made his international reputation. Sholokhov's detractors claimed that it was written by Fyodor Kryukov, a Cossack and anti-Bolshevik, who died in 1920. In 1987, several thousand pages of notes and drafts of the work were discovered and authenticated, including chapters excluded from the final draft. An analysis of the novel has unambiguously proved Sholokhov's authorship. The writing paper dates back to the 1920s: 605 pages are in Sholokhov's own hand, and 285 are transcribed by his wife Maria and sisters.

An asteroid in main-belt is named after him, 2448 Sholokhov.

Tikhon Khrennikov

Tikhon Khrennikov (born Yelets, Russian Empire, 10 June 1913; died Moscow, 14 August 2007) was a Russian musician. He was a composer and pianist He got involved in the musical politics of his country, which was then the Soviet Union. A lot of people hated him, especially in western countries. He is particularly remembered for what he did at the unpleasant conference in 1948, when some of the most famous Soviet composers, including Shostakovich and Prokofiev, were made to say they were sorry for the music they had written and that they would compose better music in future.

In the days of the Soviet Union, and especially under Stalin, musicians had to be very careful about what they did and how they composed. Music, like all arts, was supposed to make people feel that they were lucky to be living in a great country like the Soviet Union. If composers wrote music that the politicians did not like or understand, life became very difficult for them: they would not be allowed to compose, and their music could not be performed. They might even be sent to prison. Tikhon Khrennikov became Secretary to the Union of Soviet Composers in 1948, at the time when Stalin was dictator. He continued in this job until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. He made sure that all musicians obeyed their political leaders.

It is difficult for us today to judge the actions of Khrennikov fairly. He survived because he did what he was told by Soviet dictators. After the collapse of the Soviet Union he tried to say he was sorry for what he did. It is difficult to judge whether he really meant this.

Tikhon Khrennikov was the youngest of ten children, born into a family of horse traders, in the town of Yelets in the Russian province of Lipetsk in central Russia. His family started to teach him the guitar and mandolin. When he was nine he started learning the piano, and when he was 13 he started composing. Three years later he was sent to the Gnesin Academy of Music, studying with the composer Mikhail Gnesin. In 1932 he went on to the Moscow Conservatoire. He studied composition with Vissarion Shebalin and piano with the famous teacher Heinrich Neuhauss who was later the teacher of Emil Gilels and Sviatoslav Richter.

His early works include a symphony, a piano concerto, and an opera based on the book "Into the Storm" which was based on a novel "Loneliness", a favourite book of Stalin. His music was always happy and energetic. He wrote music for 22 films and many patriotic songs. He did everything he could to please Stalin, and soon he became Secretary of the Union of Soviet Composers.

In 1948 he headed a conference at which Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Myaskovsky and Shebalin (who had been his teacher), were told that they were bad “formalists”. The word “formalist” has no meaning in music, but it was used by the politicians to describe anyone who was not obeying the politicians’ guidelines. Khrennikov said at the conference that “we will stop all manifestations of formalism and popular decadence".

Shostakovich had given Khrennikov some friendly advice about his opera "Into the Storm", but Khrennikov had been angry about being criticized and now he could get his own back. Shostakovich made satirical remarks about Khrennikov in an opera "Rayok" which he never showed to anyone and was found amongst his papers after his death in 1975.

After the fall of the Soviet Union Khrennikov published a book "That’s the Way It Was". In this book he says that everybody had to obey political rules and he was only doing what everyone else did. However, he then wrote some bad things about Shostakovich. Khrennikov had also been an enemy of the composer Alfred Schnittke. He banned his music from being played, and was furious when it was performed in other countries. He also banned music by other composers who have now become famous such as Sofia Gubaidulina and Viktor Suslin.

Khrennikov was, however, not all bad. He supported Shostakovich and Prokofiev for getting the Stalin Prizes in the 1950s. He also invited Stravinsky, who had been exiled to the United States, to revisit the Soviet Union in 1962.

When he was in his eighties, Khrennikov continued to compose many comic operas, operettas and ballets. They always had tunes that were easy for people to enjoy.

The Soviet state gave him many prizes for the work he did: three Stalin Prizes, a State Prize of the USSR and a Lenin Prize. Before his death he was even given an award by Vladimir Putin, which makes it seem as if Russia might be returning to its past values.

He died in Moscow aged 94.

Lisa Marie Presley

Lisa Marie Presley (February 1, 1968 – January 12, 2023) was an American singer and songwriter. She was the only child of singer/actor Elvis Presley and actress Priscilla Presley. 

She was the owner of Graceland. It is the mansion her father lived in. She had released three albums.

Presley was born in Baptist Memorial Hospital-Memphis in Memphis, Tennessee. She was the only daughtor of singer and actor Elvis Presley and actress Priscilla Presley.

In July 2023, her autopsy report said that Presley died of small bowel obstruction caused by weight loss surgery she recently had.

Dialysis

Dialysis is where a machine is used to replace a kidney after kidney failure. The word "dialysis" comes from the Greek word "dialusis", "dia" meaning through, and "lusis" meaning loosening.

Dialysis can be used for people who have become sick and have lost the use of their kidneys for a short time, or for people who no longer have working kidneys. The purpose of the kidney is to keep a balance of water and minerals in the body. These minerals include sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium and sulfate. The kidneys also take out hydrogen ions from the blood. Dialysis is able to remove these wastes from the body and help keep the minerals in balance.

However the kidneys are also part of the endocrine system and make erythropoietin and calcitriol. Dialysis machines are not able to replace this part of the kidney's function.

Dialysis machines work by using diffusion and ultrafiltration. A very fine material, called a membrane, allows blood and fluid to flow through it. In the machine, the blood flows in one direction, and on the other side of the membrane, a special fluid, dialysate flows in the opposite direction, this process is known as osmosis. Dialysate is a fluid that has different chemicals in it, such as potassium and calcium. A doctor would decide what mixture of chemicals would be needed for each patient. The dialysate has bicarbonate in it to lower the higher acid levels that these patients often have. The blood and dialysate mix together. The waste products are removed from the blood and caught up in the fine membrane.

Dialysis was originally done in hospitals, and then in many countries moved to local clinics, as the number of patients increased. In 2023 more patients have a portable machine at home and have to manage the process themselves. 

A dialyser is part of a dialysis machine. The dialyser filters blood like a kidney. It is made of a clear hollow cylinder with two inlets and two outlets. One inlet and outlet is at the upper side and downside which are for blood entrance and exit before and after purification. The other inlet and outlet are beside through which a supporter liquid goes into the dialyser.

A dialyser has very thin fibres of cellulose. The fibres work as a semi-permeable membrane (SPM). There are about 10,000 of them. Impurities such as urea keratin leave through the SPM. Blood cells cannot go through because the blood cells are bigger than the impurities. The whole process of purification is supported by a liquid called dialysate. Dialysate is sent into the dialyser by the pump in the dialysis machine. The pure liquid goes in and the impure dialysate comes out. Dialysers are also called artificial kidneys.

Kinkajou

The kinkajou is a mammal of the family Procyonidae and it is related to the raccoon, coati, olingo, raingtail and cacomistle. It lives in the rainforests of South America and Central America, and spends most of its time on trees. It can eat both meat and plants and has a gripping tail that can be used like an arm. It is an endangered species because it is being hunted for its fur, meat and to be illegally sold as pets.

Although kinkajous may look like monkeys, lemurs, koalas, opossums, bears or ferrets, they are not related to those animals. An adult kinkajou's weight is between 1-3 kg (3-7 lb). Its body can grow up to 43-56 cm long (17-22 in) and its tail usually measures between 16-22 cm (41- 56 in). The kinkajou has woolly fur consisting of an outer golden (brownish-gray) coat and another gray coat underneath.

The Barber of Seville

The Barber of Seville (in Italian: Il barbiere di Siviglia) is a comic opera (opera buffa) in two acts by the composer Gioachino Rossini. The libretto (words) are based on a comedy by Pierre Beaumarchais called "The Barber of Seville". It is Rossini's most famous opera, containing some very well known tunes.

The first performance took place on 20 February, 1816 in Rome.

Rossini's opera was not the first one to be based on Beaumarchais' play. The composer Giovanni Paisiello had written one with the same title, and another was composed in 1796 by Nicolas Isouard. Paisiello's opera was popular for a time, but soon Rossini's opera became famous and Paisiello's opera was forgotten.

Mozart's opera "Le nozze di Figaro," composed in 1786 is also based on the same play, but it deals with the second part of the play (the play was in three parts).

Rossini is well known for being able to compose very quickly. He composed all the music for "The Barber of Seville" in less than three weeks. He borrowed the overture from something he had written earlier. 

When the opera was first performed on 20 February 1816 it was a big failure. The audience hissed and jeered the whole time, and there were several little accidents on the stage. At one point a cat walked onto the stage.

The second time it was performed it was a great success.

"The square in front of Dr. Bartolo's house"

The story takes place in the town of Seville in Spain. It is supposed to be the 17th century. In a town square outside Dr. Bartolo's house a band of musicians are serenading outside the window of Rosina. Among them is Lindoro, who is pretending to be a poor student, but he is really Count Almaviva in disguise. He hopes that Rosina will love him. He pays the musicians who then leave.

Figaro comes in. He used to be Almaviva's servant. The aria that he sings is very famous. It is called "Largo al factotum". Almaviva asks him to help him meet Rosina, offering him money if he can do it. Figaro says he should disguise himself as a soldier and pretend to be drunk and to try and get into the house. 

Inside Dr Bartolo's house Rosina sings a song "Una voce poco fa" ("A voice just now"). 
Rosina writes to the Count, calling him Lindoro, because she thinks that is his name. As she is leaving the room, Bartolo and Basilio enter. Bartolo is suspicious of the Count, and Basilio says that they should start to tell bad stories about him to get him out of the way.

When they are gone, Rosina and Figaro enter. Figaro asks Rosina to write a short note to Lindoro. She has already done this. She is surprised by Bartolo, but she manages to fool him.

Berta, Dr Bartolo's servant, tries to leave the house. She is met by the Count disguised as an drunken soldier. Bartolo cannot get rid of the Count, who manages to have a quick word with Rosina. He whispers to her that he is called Lindoro and gives her a letter. Bartolo is watching and is suspicious. He wants to know what the letter is about, but Rosina fools him by giving him a list of things to be washed. Bartolo and the Count start arguing. Basilio, Figaro and Berta appear and the noise is heard by the Officer of the Watch and his men. Bartolo thinks that the Count has been arrested, but Almaviva tells the officer his real name and he is immediately released. Bartolo and Basilio cannot understand why this happened. Rosina laughs at them.

"Dr. Bartolo's house"

Almaviva comes to the doctor's house again. This time he is disguised as a music teacher. He is pretending that Basilio is ill and that he has come instead. At first Bartolo is suspicious but he soon lets him in when he shows him Rosina's letter. He gives Rosina a singing lesson. Bartolo thinks that Lindoro is one of the Count's servants and that he is trying to get girls for the Count. Bartolo does not want to leave him alone with Rosina, so he gets Figaro (who is a barber) to shave him.
When Basilio suddenly appears, Almaviva bribes him with some money and he goes away saying he is sick. Bartolo realizes in the end that it is a trick, and gets everyone out of the room. He goes to a notary to get a marriage contract made between himself and Rosina. He shows Rosina the letter she wrote to "Lindoro", and makes her think that Lindoro is a servant and cunning friend of Almaviva.

The stage is empty while the music creates a thunder storm. The Count and Figaro climb up a ladder to the balcony and enter the room through a window. Rosina shows Almaviva the letter and says she is very sad. Almaviva tells her who he really is. Rosina now loves him. Figaro tells them they should leave. Basilio and the notary come to the front door and try to leave by the ladder, but it has gone. Basilio can either take a bribe a be a witness to the marriage or he can be shot dead. He decides, together with Figaro, to witness the signing of the marriage contract between the Count and Rosina. Bartolo rushes in, but is too late. Bartolo (who was the one who had taken away the ladder) is made happy when he is told he can keep Rosina's dowry.

Otto Heinrich Warburg

Otto Heinrich Warburg (October 8, 1883 - August 1, 1970) was a German chemist. After earning his doctorate degrees in medicine and chemistry, he started to investigate how oxygen is consumed by cells in a living organism. His studies led him to identify the role of the cytochromes.

He won the 1931 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of the respiratory enzyme.

In the 1920s, Warburg and his colleagues observed that tumors take up higher amounts of glucose than their surrounding tissues. Although consuming glucose is helpful for mammals because it is a nutrient, tumor cells consume too much glucose despite having working mitochondria and enough presence of oxygen. This observation is called the Warburg effect.

Following this observation, Warburg and his colleagues concluded: that to kill a tumor cell, it must be deprived of glucose.

Suprachiasmatic nucleus

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), is a small nucleus in the hypothalamus. It is in middle of the brain. It sits on top of the optic chiasma. 

It is our "body clock", and controls our daily rhythms by hormones and nerve impulses. With its various cell types, it puts out peptides such as vasopressin and vasoactive intestinal peptide) and neurotransmitters.

The SCN controls when we get sleepy, when we wake up, when we are active and when we get hungry. The SCN gets information about light and dark from the retina in the eye so it can adjust itself to the true 24 hours. To do this it uses only about 20,000 neurons.

The SCN also exchanges information with many other parts of the brain. It uses many different types of cells and many different types of peptides (including vasopressin and vasoactive intestinal peptide) and neurotransmitters.

London Underground 1938 Stock

The London Underground 1938 Stock is a deep-level tube stock that runs on the London Underground from 1938 to present. During their long lives they work on the Bakerloo, Northern, Piccadilly, East London and Central lines. 

These trains do still run on the London Underground. The trains were built by Metro-Cammell and Birmingham RC&W. Some trains still run on the Isle of Wight's Island Line as the class 483. In March 2007, South West Trains purchased the rolling stock outright from HSBC Rail for £1. They are the oldest trains used on timetabled services on the National Rail network.

The 1938 tube stock was built as part of the London Passenger Transport Board's New Works Programme, that took place between 1935–1940. The trains are mainly meant to be used on the Northern and Bakerloo lines. Seven more trains were also to be used on the Piccadilly line.

During the 1950s and 1960s the Northern Line only used 1938 and 1949 tube stock trains. These trains were starting to show how old they are by the late 1960s. The first trains were withdrawn from the Northern line in the early 1970s when they were replaced by the 1972 tube stock trains. Some units are still in service from preservation.

Lawful interception

Lawful interception is the electronic surveillance of telecommunication services, such as telephone calls or e-mail messages, as approved by law. It is usually done by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. In some places, the law allows such agencies to monitor otherwise private communications data under certain circumstances. This is done for analysis or evidence. It has become an important tool for law enforcement.

The data gathered is generally signalling or network management information. In fewer cases, it may also be the content of the communications (for example, the conversation or written message).

Steve McNair

Steve LaTreal McNair (February 14, 1973 – July 4, 2009, nicknamed "Air McNair") was an American football quarterback who played for the Tennessee Titans and the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League. He played college football for Alcorn State University. McNair was murdered on July 4, 2009.

McNair was born in Mount Olive, Mississippi, USA McNair credits much of his success to his older brother, Fred, who played a very important part in raising McNair and his siblings, plus helping their mother. He and attended Mount Olive High School starting in 1987, where he played football, baseball, and basketball, and ran track. He led his school to the State Championship as a sophomore.

McNair was offered a full scholarship to the University of Florida to play defensive back but wanting to play quarterback. McNair played college football for Alcorn State University in the NCAA. In 1992, McNair threw for 3,541 yards and 29 touchdowns, and ran in for 10 more scores. The Braves went 7–4. McNair helped Alcorn State to another good year in 1993, as the Braves upped their record to 8–3 while McNair threw for more than 3,000 yards and 30 touchdowns. 

As a senior in 1994, McNair had nearly 6,000 yards rushing and passing, with 53 touchdowns and was named an All-American. McNair also won the Walter Payton Award as the top I-AA player and finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting behind Rashaan Salaam and Ki-Jana Carter. McNair set career records for the Football Championship Series with 14,496 passing yards.

McNair was selected by the Houston Oilers with new head coach Jeff Fisher. McNair stayed in Houston for a few solid years, although McNair was often used as a backup. Runningback Eddie George assisted McNair with his strong running. In 1997 (McNair's first year as a starter), the Oilers moved to Tennessee, and became the Titans before the 1999 season, and also began play in LP Field, or as it was called then, Adelphia Collesium, in 1999.

Early in the 1999 season, McNair was diagnosed with an inflamed disk following Tennessee's 36–35 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, and needed surgery. He was replaced by veteran Neil O'Donnell. Over the next five games, O'Donnell led the Titans to a 4–1 record. McNair returned against the St. Louis Rams, and with McNair starting, Tennessee won seven of its last nine games to finish 13-3.

Tennessee opened the at home against the Buffalo Bills in a Wild Card game, winning on the "Music City Miracle" and got to Super Bowl XXXIV in a re-match with the St. Louis Rams. On the final play of the game, a McNair pass to Kevin Dyson was complete, but Dyson could not break the plane of the goal line, giving the Rams the win. McNair signed a six-year contract with the Titans after the season.

McNair led the Titans to another solid 13-3 season in 2000, but it ended in a hard-fought playoff loss to the Baltimore Ravens in the Divisional Round.

In 2001, McNair had passing highs in yards (3,350), completions (264), touchdowns (21) and quarterback rating (90.2). He also had five scores rushing. McNair was named to the Pro Bowl for the first time, but the game due to a shoulder injury.

After a solid 2002 season, McNair was arrested for DUI (and he also had a handgun in his possession). However, all charges were eventually dropped. McNair and Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning were named co-MVPs for the 2003 season, although McNair had to sit out two games. Injuries continued to bother McNair over the next two seasons, as he played in only eight games in 2004 and fourteen in 2005.

On June 8, 2006 McNair was traded to the Baltimore Ravens. McNair was given the starting job in Baltimore over the disappointing Kyle Boller. McNair started all 16 games in 2006, but often rotated in and out with Boller. McNair got the Ravens to a 13-3 record. McNair's 2006 statistics with the Ravens included 295 pass completions on 468 attempts for 3,050 passing yards, 16 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. McNair also ran for a score in a win against the New Orleans Saints.

McNair and the Ravens both had a bad season in 2007. The Ravens went 5-11, and McNair was often injured. Due to bad quarterback play, McNair would always play when healthy over Kyle Boller and rookie Troy Smith, but McNair still threw only two touchdowns next to four interceptions. That was his last year in the NFL. McNair had his retirement press conference with the Ravens in April, 2008.

McNair was married to Mechelle McNair from June 21, 1997 until his death. McNair had a farm in Mississipi, USA, where he would often go.

McNair had two sons by Mechelle: Steve LaTreal McNair, Steven O'Brian Koran McNair; and two sons - Tyler and Trenton - by two other women.

McNair earned the nickname "Air McNair" in High School. He opened his own restaurant in Nashville, which he named Gridiron9. McNair was also a mentor to quarterback Vince Young.

On July 4, 2009, McNair and 20-year old Sahel Kazemi were found dead in a condominium rented by McNair in Nashville. McNair had several gunshot wounds, and Kazemi had only one to the head. Kazemi had been arrested for DUI two days earlier, and McNair left with his restaurant chef in a taxi. Traces of gunpowder were found on Kazemi's hand, as well as a gun. Kazemi was having trouble financially, and apparently found out that McNair had other relationships. Police ruled this a murder-suicide, with Kazemi as the killer, McNair as the victim. Many people came to McNair's funeral, including some notable players, like fellow QB Brett Favre and former teammate Ray Lewis. Said Titans owner Bud Adams:

To the Associated Press, Ravens General Manager Ozzie Newsome added:
McNair was buried in Memphis on July 11, 2009.



Elizabeth Cross

The Elizabeth Cross is an award within the British honours system that is issued to the next of kin of a service man or woman who died due to enemy action or terrorism since 1949. The award comes with a memorial scroll that contains the dead persons name, when they died and has the Queen's signature on it. It is the most recent medal, honour or award to bear the name of a reigning monarch of the United Kingdom since the George Cross. It is not an award for valour or bravery. It is in the shape of a cross with four equal sides that contains flowers at the end of each arm that represents the four countries within the union of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The medal also contains a laurel wreath behind the cross and bears the dead person's name on the back. The medal comes with a miniature (small version) medal for day wear. The medal can only be worn by the next of kin and for anyone else to wear it (even if related to the person who died) is a criminal offence.



Corrosive substance

Corrosive substances are substances that can damage tissues when they come in contact with them. Many corrosive liquids are in common use, for example, in batteries. Some are used in cleaning, for example hydrochloric acid is used in some toilet bowl cleaners. Corrosive is one of the five danger risks that a liquid can have, along with toxic, flammable, explosive, and biological hazard.

Corrosive substances are to be dealt with extreme precaution and care. They are extremely harmful and dangerous. 

Malus

Malus is a genus of about 30–35 species of small deciduous apple trees or shrubs in the family Rosaceae. Other studies say it includes 55 species, including the domesticated orchard apple, or table apple as it used to be called. The other species and subspecies are generally known as "wild apples", "crab apples", "crabapples" or "crabs".

The genus is native to the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, in Europe, Asia and North America.

Apple trees are small, usually 4–12 m tall when full grown. The leaves are 3–10 cm long, positioned opposite from each other. They have a simple shape with a saw-tooth edge. The flowers come from corymbs, and have five petals, which may be white, pink or red, with usually red stamens that produce lots of pollen, and an ovary which is below them. Flowering takes place in the spring and pollination is by insects (typically bees, which freely visit the flowers for both nectar and pollen). 

The fruit of the other species is not an important crop in most areas because they are very sour and (in some species) very like wood, and are rarely eaten raw for this reason. However, crabapples are an excellent source of pectin, and their juice can be made into a ruby-coloured jelly. Some kinds of crab apples make good applesauce.

Crabapples are widely grown as trees for the pleasure of their appearance, grown for their beautiful flowers or fruit. There are cultivars selected for these qualities and for resistance to disease.

Some crab apples are used as rootstocks for domestic apples to stand up to cold or drought.

They are also used as tree for pollinating food apple trees in apple orchards. Varieties of crab apple are selected to bloom at the same time as the apple trees in an orchard, and the crabs are planted every sixth or seventh tree, or limbs of a crab tree are grafted onto some of the apple trees. See also fruit tree pollination.

Because of the many blossoms and small sized fruit, crab apples are popular for use in bonsai. Because the trees are small due to the needs of the hobby, but still show the abundant fruit bearing of full-sized crab apples, it is important to thin out fruit so that trees do not stress themselves.

Apple wood "makes a wonderfully luxurious firewood with a lovely scent [smell], and smoke from an apple wood fire gives a most excellent flavour to smoked foods," including Applewood cheese.


Operation Ichi-Go

Operation Ichi-Go (or "Operation Number One") was a series of battles between the armies of Japan and China. The battles happened between April and December 1944. There were three battles in the Chinese provinces of Henan, Hunan and Guangxi. The goals of Operation Ichi-go were to make a route to French Indochina and to capture bases that American bombers were using to attack Japan and her shipping.

There were two parts to the operation. In the first part, the Japanese secured the Railway between Beijing and Wuhan. In the second part they destroyed the US air forces in Hunan province and reached the city of Liuzhou. Liuzhou was near the border with Japanese-occupied Indochina.

400,000 men, 12,000 vehicles and 70,000 horses took part in operation Ichi-Go. The Japanese army included the very well trained Kwantung Army units and equipment from Manchukuo, North China and Japan. It was the largest land operation by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Many of the new American-trained Chinese units were fighting in Burma under General Joseph Stilwell using weapons leased from the United States. Chiang Kai-shrek had agreed that Stilwell could manage the distribution of American arms. 

In "Operation Kogo", 390,000 Chinese soldiers, led by General Tang Enbo, defended Luoyang. The Japanese 3rd Tank Division crossed the Yellow River around Zhengzhou in late April and defeated the Chinese near Xuchang. They then moved around to the right and put Luoyang under siege. Luoyang was defended by three Chinese divisions. The 3rd Tank Division began to attack on May 13 and won Luoyang on May 25.

The second part of Ichigo began in May. Japanese forces moved south and occupied Changsha, Hengyang, Guilin and Liuzhou. In December 1944, Japanese forces reached French Indochina and completed the operation. Despite this success, US air forces moved inland from the threatened bases near the coast. The U.S. Air Force often stopped the railway between Beijing and Liuzhou that had been started in Operation Ichigo. Japan continued to attack airfields where US air forces were stationed up to the spring of 1945.

USA's XX Bomber Command were using B-29 bombers like the ones that were attacking Japan. They were forced to move as well, but this affected their efficiency for only a short time. In early 1945 the Twentieth Air Force moved to newly established bases in the Marianas under the command of the newly established XXI Bomber Command.

The failure to hold the coastal airfields led to a loss of confidence in General Joseph Stilwell by Chiang Kai-shek. Stilwell was replaced in October 1944 by President Roosevelt. The new Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-Shek and commander of the U.S. Forces in China was Major General Albert Wedemeyer. Stillwell's other responsibilities in China, Burma and India were given to other officers.

A very different version of events was that General Joseph Stilwell was asking for a fuller use of Chinese forces and had made diplomatic connections with the Chinese Red Army commanded by Mao Zedong. They had agreed to follow an American commander.

Because Chiang Kai-shek was ignored by the American general, he had Stilwell called back to the United States. "New York Times" reporter Brooks Atkinson wrote at the time: The decision to relieve General Stilwell represents the political triumph of a moribund, anti-democratic regime that is more concerned with maintaining its political supremacy than in driving the Japanese out of China. America is now committed... to support a regime that has become increasingly unpopular and mistrusted in China, that maintains three secret police services and concentration camps for political prisoners, that stifles free speech and resists democratic forces... The Chinese Communists... have good armies that are now fighting guerrilla warfare against the Japanese in North China... The Generalissimo regards these armies as the chief threat to his supremacy... has made no sincere attempt to arrange at least a truce with them for the duration of the war... No diplomatic genius could have overcome the Generalissimo's basic unwillingness to risk his armies in battle with the Japanese...
But the "Time Magazine" article in which Atkinson was quoted went on to talk about the true failure of Stilwell's goals by saying that: The Chinese, exhausted by seven years of almost singlehanded war against Japan, were reluctant to give General Stilwell the troops he wanted for the Burma offensive; the Japs might suddenly crack down on them in earnest. When the Japs began the drive that last week seemed on the verge of cutting China in two, Chiang Kai-shek's Government might well have felt that its go-slow policy was justified..." 

This loss and the poor opinion in the U.S.A. caused the Americans to lose confidence in the Chinese troops. Instead the U.S. focused all its resources on the island-to-island war in the Pacific.

Jawaharlal Nehru

Jawaharlal Nehru (also referred to as "Pandit Nehru") (November 14, 1889 - May 27, 1964) was the first prime minister of India for 17 years. He became prime minister after India became independent in 1947. He was born in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, India. He died of a heart attack in New Delhi.

Nehru was the first prime minister of India after it became independent from the British rule.

Under British rule, Nehru was jailed many times. During these periods, he used to write long letters to his daughter, Indira, on Indian and World history. These letters were remarkably well written and became very successful books when published later as "Glimpses of World History" and "The Discovery of India".

Jawahar Lal Nehru was born on November 14, 1889, in Allahabad to Pandit Motilal Nehru and Swarup Rani. His father Motilal Nehru, a lawyer, served twice as the president of Indian National Congress and was an important figure in the Indian freedom struggle. His sister, Vijayalakshmi Pandit was the first woman president of United Nations General Assembly. His daughter Indira Gandhi and grandson Rajiv Gandhi became prime ministers of India.

Nehru received his early education at home and later went to Trinity College, Cambridge and graduated with the honors degree in natural science. He studied Law at Inns of Court school. Nehru returned to India in 1912.

Black Sea

The Black Sea is a sea in Eurasia between Europe, Caucasus, and Anatolia. Many rivers flow to the Black Sea, including the big rivers, the Don, Danube, Dniester and Dnieper.

It is connected to the Atlantic Ocean through the Bosphorus strait, the Sea of Marmara, the Dardanelles strait, the Aegean Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the Strait of Gibraltar. 90% of the sea has no oxygen. The water is saltwater but less salty than the ocean. During the last ice age, the Black Sea was a freshwater lake. 

In Greek mythology, the Argonauts traveled on the sea. Greeks set up colonies around the sea because it was important to trade for many countries in ancient history. The Gallipoli Campaign during World War I was a fight for access to the Black Sea. It was also important in World War II.

The Black Sea sits on continental plates which have subsided. It is a geologic basin, and therefore is a genuine inland sea. Its maximum depth is about 2000 metres. The Black Sea is the world’s largest basin where the deep waters do not mix with the upper layers of water that receive oxygen from the atmosphere. As a result, over 90% of the deeper Black Sea volume is anoxic water. The upper layers are generally cooler, less dense and less salty than the deeper waters, as they are fed by large river systems, whereas the deep waters come from the warm, salty waters of the Mediterranean. 
The Crimean Peninsula divides this sea. The Bosporus and Dardanelles connect the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.

Young Poland

Young Poland (in Polish: "Młoda Polska") is a period modernist of Polish art, literature and music. This period covered about the years since 1890 until 1918. It was one of the effects of the strong opposition to the ideas of the positivism and developed the nature of decadence, of neoromanticism, of symbolism, of impressionism, and of the Art Nouveau. 

The expression was known after one of the manifestos written by Artur Górski. The manifesto was published in the daily (newspaper) "Życie" ("Life"), seated in Cracow, in the year 1898, and was immediately accepted in all the parts of the divided Poland, by analogy with other similar expressions as Young Germany, Young Belgium, Young Scandinavia and so on.

Polish literature of the period was based on two main understandings: 

Other important writers of the period were:

In music, the expression "Young Poland" is put into use to an informal group of composers which include Karol Szymanowski, Grzegorz Fitelberg, Ludomir Różycki and probably also Mieczysław Karłowicz. This group worked under the strong influence of the neoromanticism of the music, and especially of composers from another countries as Richard Strauss and Richard Wagner. The composers would be also strong links with the The Five, a group of composers Russian which included Modest Musorgski, Alexander Borodin and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.

In the period of the Young Poland there were not any great artistic currents in Polish art. The painters and the sculptors attempted to continue in the romantic tradition, in bringing new ways of expression already popular in another countries. The more influential current was the Art Nouveau, even if the Polish artists started attempting also new forms of national style. The sculptura just like the painture of the period were strongly influenced by all the forms of the symbolism.


Hurricane Felix

Hurricane Felix was a strong Category 5 hurricane with fastest wind speeds of 175 mph. It was part of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season.

Hurricane Cesar-Douglas

Hurricane Cesar-Douglas was a Category 4 hurricane that crossed the Atlantic as Hurricane Cesar. The storm continue to move west to the Pacific as Hurricane Douglas. The storm was the strongest storm for the 1996 Pacific hurricane season. It was the second hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season, in the Atlantic it was a category 1.

The start of this storm goes back to a tropical wave near Dakar, Senegal. It crossed the Atlantic and did not start until it was close to the Windward Islands. On July 24 it became Tropical Depression Three. Tropical Depression Three became Tropical Storm Cesar on July 25. Cesar did not strengthen much because it was close to land. It did start to strengthen more as it entered the Southwestern Caribbean Sea. After about half way between Nicaragua and South America, Tropical Storm Cesar became a hurricane on July 27. Hurricane Cesar reached its highest winds on July 28, which were at 85 mph. Later that day, Hurricane Cesar made landfall near Bluefields, in Nicaragua while it still had its highest winds. Cesar weakened into a tropical storm over Central America. But it did survive crossing Central America. 

Late on July 28, Cesar reached the Pacific Ocean and was renamed Tropical Storm Douglas. By the next day, Tropical Storm Douglas became a hurricane. Later, on August 1, Hurricane Douglas reached its highest wind, which were at 130 mph. Douglas started getting weaker because of cooler waters. On August 5, Hurricane Douglas died.

The name "Cesar" was retired and the name "Douglas" was not retired. In 2002 and 2008 the name Cristobal was used instead, it was not retired. For the Pacific, the name "Douglas" used in 2002 and 2008, it still wasn't retired.

Georg Solti

Sir Georg Solti (pronounce: “George Shollti”), (born Budapest, 21 October 1912; died Antibes, France, 5 September 1997) was a Hungarian conductor who later became a naturalized British citizen.

Solti was born "György Stern" in Budapest to a Jewish family. His father changed his name from "György" to "Georg" and changed his family name to "Solti". This was so that his name did not look Jewish, because there was a lot of antisemitism in Europe.

He learned the piano but, when he was 14, he heard Erich Kleiber conduct Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 and he immediately wanted to be a conductor. He studied at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, under Béla Bartók, Zoltán Kodály, Leo Weiner and Ernst von Dohnanyi. By 1935 he was becoming known as a conductor. He conducted "The Marriage of Figaro" at the Budapest Opera in 1938. It was the first time he had conducted there, and it was also to be the last time. That very day, Hitler annexed Austria. Life became dangerous for Jews in Hungary. In 1939, he moved to Switzerland, where he continued a career as a pianist and won the Geneva International Piano Competition, but he did not have many chances to conduct there. His father became ill and died, so he never saw him again.

After World War II Solti became music director of the Bavarian State Orchestra in Munich (where he gave the first performance in Germany of Paul Hindemith's opera "Mathis der Maler", which had been banned when the Nazis were in power. He conducted the Frankfurt Opera where he gave the first performance in Germany of Alban Berg's "Lulu". In 1951 he performed at the Salzburg Festival conducting Mozart's "Idomeneo".

Solti often conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and it was arranged that he would be their main conductor (music director) from 1962. However, Solti changed his mind because they appointed Zubin Mehta as assistant conductor without telling Solti. Mehta became musical director instead.

In 1961 Solti became music director at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and stayed there until 1971. He was a great conductor, but made the musicians work very hard. With his bald head he got the nickname "The Screaming Skull". He spent much of his time in Britain and the United States.

His first marriage ended in divorce. His second marriage was to Valerie Pitts, a British television presenter whom he met when she was sent to interview him. They had two daughters, Gabrielle and Claudia. He was given an honorary Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1971. The next year he became a British citizen, and was then known as Sir Georg Solti.

Solti helped many young musicians, training them in workshops and giving them opportunities to perform.

Solti was music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO) from 1969 until 1991, when he was given the title of Music Director Laureate, the only CSO conductor to be given that title. He made them into a world class orchestra and took them on tours to other countries. He gave 999 performances with the CSO. He died before his 1,000th performance. A square near the Symphony Center in Chicago was called "Sir Georg Solti Place" in his memory.

Solti also had other jobs. He was music director of the Orchestre de Paris from 1972 until 1975. From 1979 until 1983 he was principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra. During this time with the London Philharmonic he performed and recorded many works by Elgar including the two symphonies, the Violin Concerto with Kyung Wha Chung and the Cello Concerto with Julian Lloyd Webber. In 1983 he conducted Wagner's Ring Cycle at Bayreuth for the only time. For the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, Solti formed the World Orchestra for Peace, which consisted of musicians from 47 orchestras around the world.

Solti worked with Dudley Moore on a 1991 television series, "Orchestra!", which was made to explain to people all about the orchestra.

Solti never retired. He had many plans for concerts and recordings when he suddenly died of a heart attack on 5 September 1997 in Antibes, France He was given a state funeral, and was buried next to Bartók who had been his teacher and had helped him a lot. Solti’s widow and daughters began the Solti Foundation to help young musicians.

Communist Party of the Soviet Union

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) was the ruling political party in the Soviet Union, and the only legal one. The leaders of the party were Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Lavrentiy Beria, Georgy Malenkov, Nikita Khrushchev, Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov, Konstantin Chernenko, and finally Mikhail Gorbachev.

Before the creation of the Russian Communist Party in 1918, its members were part of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. They made up a group within that party, which was called the Bolsheviks. The first leader of the CPSU was Vladimir Lenin. The first General Secretary of the party was Stalin from 1922–52. The party led the 1917 October Revolution that overthrew the Russian Provisional Government during World War I. From 1918–25, the name of the party was Russian Communist Party. From 1925–52, the name was All-Union Communist Party. The Party took the name Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1952.

The Communist Party controlled all the government in the Soviet Union. The party supported communist movements in Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa. In 1990, during a big reform called "perestroika", or "restructuring", the party lost its position as the only party allowed. The CPSU was dissolved in 1991, and continued as the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. The new CPRF has sometimes been the largest in the Russian parliament, the State Duma.


Toroidal inductors and transformers

Toroidal inductors and transformers are a kind of electronic component. They typically consist of a circular, ring-shaped magnetic centre. The magnet is usually considered a monopole, although the central axis will have a dipole, and have the advantage of being wound continuously in a single direction, thus there is no inductive interference between windings as in a solenoid that is wound back and forth.



V-2

The V-2 rocket () was the world's first ballistic missile and first human object to fly in space. All modern rockets are based on the V2 design. 

The first successful launch was from Peenemünde on 3 October, 1942, reaching a height of 192 km. The V2 was designed by Nazis to bomb London, Antwerp and other European cities. It travelled at four times the speed of sound so was impossible to shoot down. 

The first V-2 used as a weapon exploded in Paris on 8 September 1944, with a second rocket exploding in London later that day. Over 3,000 V-2s were used by the German Wehrmacht against Allied targets in World War II, resulting in the death of about 7,250 military personnel and civilians.

The victors used captured V-2 rockets to start their space and missile programs. In the United States they were helped by the team of German rocket scientists from Peenemünde, led by Wernher von Braun. They had surrendered to the US at the end of the war. 

The first US-assembled V-2, made from parts captured in Germany, was launched from White Sands, New Mexico, in April 1946. There were 66 V-2 rocket flights, the last on October 29, 1951.

In the late 1920s, a young Wernher von Braun bought a copy of Hermann Oberth's book, "Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen" ("The Rocket into Interplanetary Spaces"). Starting in 1930, he attended the Technical University of Berlin, where he assisted Oberth in liquid-fueled rocket motor tests. In 1933 he went to work for the Army designing and building rockets. The final, biggest rocket was the A-4, later called V-2.

On 22 Dec. 1942, Hitler signed the order for mass production, when Speer assumed final technical data would be ready by July 1943. However, many issues still remained to be solved even by the autumn of 1943. Around this time, production was shifted to the concentration camp of where an estimated 20,000 prisoners died producing V-1s and V-2s.

Test launch was recovered by Polish resistance on 30 May 1944 and rocket from Blizna was transported to the UK during Operation Most III.




The Guardian Legend

"The Guardian Legend" got mixed reviews from "Electronic Gaming Monthly" and "Nintendo Power". People liked the game for how it looked, sounded, and felt. Other people did not like the game because the play was the same. It also had a very long password. The game was not well known at first, but it is more known now. It is an example of a game where players do different things.

In "The Guardian Legend", the player controls the female guardian of Earth, a "robot transformer"; the Japanese version of the game calls her "Miria". The player is to destroy the alien moon Naju before it gets to Earth. The player needs to turn on the moon's self-destruct device and escape the moon before it gets to Earth. Five alien tribes who try to control the moon stand in the way of the player. To help players along, messages left by a person help guide them in finding the safety switches to turn on the self-destruct device. These messages also help players get to some other rooms.

The player controls the Guardian in human form while walking on Naju's surface, called the "Labyrinth". When in Naju, the Guardian turns into a spaceship in which the player can move around. The Guardian has a life meter that drops when hit by alien attacks. Players can pick up items to help fill the Guardian's life meter again. If the life meter runs out, then the Guardian dies, ending the game. The player can shoot at aliens with different types of weapons by pressing buttons on the gamepad. Players get different and better weapons during play.

Round, colored creatures in the game named "Landers" appear in the game to help players. Landers can help fill the Guardian's life meter and increase the number of times players can fire weapons. Blue Landers may sell weapons to players. They also give out passwords. Passwords let players stop the game and come back to it later.

The player goes through the Labyrinth and find entrances to the Dungeon. The ten safety devices are in the Dungeon. The Labyrinth is made up of many rooms that are as big as the screen. Players can look at a map to see where they are at. This map can be looked at while the game is paused. Players can either walk from one room to another, or they can go to another room through a "warp panel". Some of these warp panels require the right key to go through. Many rooms contain aliens. Other rooms contain clues, shops, passwords, and entrances to the Dungeon.

The Dungeon contains areas in which the Guardian flies through as a spaceship. The Dungeon has many aliens to destroy. At the end of an area in the Dungeon, there is a boss, a very strong alien that must be destroyed. After destroying the boss, the Guardian flies out of the Dungeon and back into the Labyrinth. The player then gets a power-up. The player may also receive a key for a warp panel. Some entrances to the Dungeon are already open. Other entrances need a certain task completed before going in. Clues in the Labyrinth tell players how to get into these entrances.

"The Guardian Legend" was made for the Famicom and came out in 1988 in Japan. It came out for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in 1989 and in Europe in 1990. The people who created the game were the same who created "Guardic", "Zanac", and "Puyo Puyo".

Reviewers liked the game for its multiple features. Some have compared the game to other Nintendo games like "The Legend of Zelda" and "Metroid". Mike Engler, who made "Retro Game Challenge", said that ""The Guardian Legend" is one of the best games ever released". The game was nominated by "Nintendo Power" magazine in 1989 for "Best Graphics & Sound", "Best Play Control", and "Best Overall" but did not win any of them. Some of the music of the game were remixed.



Vengeance (2006)

Vengeance (2006) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which happened on June 25, 2006 at the Charlotte Bobcats Arena in Charlotte, North Carolina. It was the sixth yearly Vengeance event. Eight professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's card. The buildup to the matches and the situations that took place before, during, and after the event were planned by WWE's script writers. The event starred wrestlers from the "Raw" brand: a storyline expansion of the promotion where employees are assigned to a wrestling brand under the WWE banner.

The main event was a 5-on-2 Handicap match, a match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with more people such as three against two, or five against two, between D-Generation X (DX) (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) versus the Spirit Squad (Kenny, Johnny, Mitch, Nicky, and Mikey). Triple H and Michaels won the match after pinning Kenny and Mikey, respectively. Two other matches were on the card. In singles matches, John Cena beat Sabu in an Extreme lumberjack match, which featured wrestlers from the "Raw" and "ECW" brands at ringside. The other featured match was for the WWE Championship, in which Rob Van Dam beat Edge to keep his title.

Vengeance made over $400,000 in ticket sales from an attendance of 6,800 and received 320,000 pay-per-view buys, which helped WWE increase its pay-per-view revenue by $21.6 million compared to the year before. When the event was released on DVD, it reached the number one position on "Billboard's" DVD Sales Chart. 

The event had eight professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers played either villains or heroes as they followed a series of events, which lead to a wrestling match or series of matches. All wrestlers belonged to the "Raw" brand – a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a different program, the other two being "SmackDown!" and "ECW".

The main event scripted into Vengeance was between D-Generation X (DX) Triple H and Shawn Michaels versus the Spirit Squad (Kenny <nowiki>[</nowiki>Ken Doane<nowiki>]</nowiki>, Johnny <nowiki>[</nowiki>Johnny Jeter<nowiki>]</nowiki>, Mitch <nowiki>[</nowiki>Nick Mitchell<nowiki>]</nowiki>, Nicky <nowiki>[</nowiki>Nick Nemeth<nowiki>]</nowiki>, and Mikey <nowiki>[</nowiki>Michael Brendli<nowiki>]</nowiki>) in a 5-on-2 Handicap match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with more people such as five against two. The story for the match began after Backlash, "Raw"'s previous pay-per-view event, where The McMahons (Vince and Shane) defeated Michaels and "God" in a tag team match, with help from the Spirit Squad in a no disqualification match, a match where neither wrestler can be disqualified, allowing for weapons and outside interference. For weeks on "Raw", Michaels got revenge on both Vince McMahon and the Spirit Squad, until the May 22 episode of "Raw", where the Spirit Squad were scripted to injure Michaels' left knee. Then, by orders of McMahon, Triple H was to "break Michaels' skull", with a sledgehammer. Triple H failed to do what McMahon ordered and instead attacked the Spirit Squad, thus turning into a hero. Two weeks later, McMahon put Triple H in a gauntlet match, against the Spirit Squad. In the match, Kenny grabbed a steel chair and put it on Triple H's left knee, similar to what the group did to Michaels. Mitch, who was the only member not participating in the match, was thrown out from the backstage curtain by Michaels. Then, Michaels joined Triple H in the ring as they began to beat down the four members of the Spirit Squad. This lead to Michaels and Triple H reforming D-Generation X for the first time since their teased reunion in 2002. That same night, McMahon scheduled the Spirit Squad and D-Generation X in a 5-on-2 handicap tag team match. On the June 19 episode of "Raw", DX marked their return, when the duo humiliated the Spirit Squad as DX dumped green slime onto the group and embarrassed the team afterward, by beating them.

One of the featured matches was between John Cena and Sabu in an Extreme lumberjack match, a standard match with the exception that the ring is surrounded by a group of wrestlers not directly involved in it and competed under hardcore rules. On the television debut of "ECW on Sci Fi" on June 13, a brawl broke out between Rob Van Dam and Edge. Edge, who tried to leave through the "ECW" crowd, was attacked by Cena, because he caused Cena to lose the WWE Championship at ECW's One Night Stand, and Cena wanted revenge against Edge. Following the attack, Cena went to ringside where he knocked ECW Representative Paul Heyman unconscious, after Heyman awarded the win to Van Dam at One Night Stand. Following the attack, Heyman announced that all ECW superstars would be at "Raw" the next week. The next week on "Raw", Heyman appeared alongside ECW superstar, Balls Mahoney, who was booked to wrestle Cena in a match. The match was won by Cena after he made Mahoney submit. After the match, Cena was attacked by ECW wrestler, Sabu, who, in the premiere of "ECW on Sci-Fi" won a 10-man Extreme Battle Royal, (a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until only one is left and declared winner) where the winner would face Cena at Vengeance in a match. Sabu beat up Cena and performed a leg drop on him, diving onto Cena and putting him through the "Raw" announcers' table. The following night on an episode of "ECW on Sci-Fi", Cena went to the "ECW" locker room, where he challenged Sabu to an Extreme lumberjack match, which Sabu accepted.

The other featured match was between WWE Champion Rob Van Dam defending the title against Edge. The story for the match began on the television premiere of "ECW on Sci-Fi", when Van Dam was awarded the ECW World Heavyweight Championship by Paul Heyman, making Van Dam a double champion by holding both the ECW and WWE Championship. Van Dam's celebration was then interrupted by Edge and his girlfriend, Lita. Edge, who was number one contender for the title, told Van Dam that they both had a lot in common, meaning that they were both Money in the Bank winners and successfully became WWE Champions. Edge ended his speech by giving Van Dam some kind words and then attacking him. On the June 19 episode of "Raw", Van Dam attacked Edge, moments after Edge won a match against Ric Flair.

Sarah Aaronsohn

Sarah Aaronsohn (January 5, 1890 in Zikhron Ya'akov – October 9, 1917 in Zikhron Ya'akov) was a Jewish spy who lived in Palestine.

She was a member of Nili (a ring of spies that worked for the British during World War I). She is sometimes called "the heroine of Nili".

After seeing thousands of Armenians being killed and tortured while she was traveling from Istanbul to Haifa, anything that reminded her of Armenians would lead her into a fit of hysteria. She started up Nili with her two brothers and a friend to help the British during World War I.

In September 1917 the Ottomans caught one of her carrier pigeons which they then worked out (decrypted) and found out where she was. After arresting lots of people, the Ottomans tortured Sarah Aaronsohn for four days before she managed to find a gun to shoot herself with. In her last written letter she said that she hopes her activities with Nili would help bring the Jews a home country.

Leeds Rhinos

Leeds Rhinos (used to be Leeds RLFC) are a Rugby League team in Leeds, West Yorkshire. They play in Super League and last won it in 2017

The Rugby Union club, Leeds St John's formed in 1870, however in 1895, when many teams broke off to form Rugby League, the club also switched codes. The club played as Leeds RLFC until 1995, when they changed their name to 'Leeds Rhinos'. This was done to mark the start of the Super League. Many other clubs made similar name changes. Leeds Rhinos have won the Super League in 2004, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2015.

Leeds Rhinos play at the Headingley Carnegie Stadium, which has both Rugby and Cricket grounds. The rugby stadium has a capacity of 22,500. The stadium is located in the Headingley district of the city and is near both Headingley and Burley Park railway stations.

Screwdriver

A screwdriver is a tool used to turn (or "drive") screws into something. It has an axial shaft with a tip of a certain shape that fits into the head of a screw. On the other end of the screwdriver is a cylindrical handle to be held by a person's hand. As the handle is rotated, it creates a torque that turns the tip via the screwdriver's shaft. There are many different sizes and kinds of screwdrivers. A screwdriver is usually identified by the shape of its tip. The tip is shaped in a certain way to match the groove cut into the head of a screw. A screwdriver is, therefore, a mechanism to apply torque to a screw and turn it in tight spaces.

Screwdrivers come in a large variety of shapes and sizes to match those of screws. If a screwdriver that is not the right size and type for the screw is used, it is likely that the screw will be damaged in the process of tightening it. Many screwdriver designs have a handle that can be used with different tips. The shaft and the tip can be removed from the handle, and a different one can be attached instead. The shaft and the tip are together called a "bit" (as with a drill bit). This allows a set of one handle and several heads to be used for a variety of screw sizes and types.

Most screwdrivers are operated manually, but there are some that use an electric or other motor to rotate the bit. They are used to drive screws quickly into various materials. There are different types of driver bits that let a drill drive different types of screws. The bit can be removed and swapped with another bit of a different shape. Many types of drills are able to be used as power screwdrivers. The best have a control over how much torque force is used, which allows the screws to be tightened to a specific level.

Ichi the Killer

Ichi the Killer is a Japanese movie by Takashi Miike. It was based on the manga by Hideo Yamamoto.

"Ichi the Killer" is a Japanese movie about a man named Kakihara who is part of a Japanese gang. He enjoys giving and receiving pain. When his gang boss goes missing, Kakihara is angry because he thinks nobody else will be able to give him as much pain and pleasure as his boss did. It turns out Kakihara's boss was murdered by a violent killer called Ichi (Japanese for the number one). 300 million yen was stolen by the group that arrived to clean the mess up. Kakihara has convinced himself that his boss is alive and tortures a member of a rival gang for information. The man turns out to be innocent and Kakihara is kicked out of his gang.
Kakihara hears about Ichi and becomes excited at the idea of somebody who can inflict more pain on him than his boss ever could. Kakihara becomes obsessed with finding Ichi.

He finally meets Ichi at the end of the movie. He is surprised and disgusted that Ichi is not the evil, cold man he imagined. He is a weak and scared teenager that only kills when he becomes upset about something. Ichi fails to kill Kakihara and lies on the floor crying. Kakihara realises Ichi cannot hurt him the way he wanted and tries to commit suicide by sticking pins in his ears. He loses his hearing and looks up to find Ichi jumping at him. Ichi knocks him off the edge of the building and Kakihara falls to his death. When we see Kakihara's body, he is apparently unharmed by Ichi's attacks. It is suggested that Kakihara imagined the attack as a result of poking his brain with the needles and fell off the building.

Chrome OS is a project by Google to develop a light computer operating system. It is devoted to using the World Wide Web. The operating system was announced on July 7, 2009, and it is based on Google's Chrome web browser as it visually similar, and the Linux kernel. When first released, it was targeted at netbooks but has also been present on laptop computers (known as "Chromebooks"). It was released to technology journalists in December 2010 after being delayed. It runs on systems with either x86 or ARM processors.

Google had stated before release that the Google Chrome OS project will be open source by the end of 2009. Although it is based on the Linux kernel, it will use "a new windowing system" (a way to display applications on a computer screen).

Upon release, some technology journalists were unsure on what it could do that a Microsoft Windows PC with the Google Chrome browser installed could not.

The Chrome OS has now been the default for previously mentioned Chromebooks and very few other Laptops from other brands than Google, these are all labeled as Chromebooks, the only difference being the Hardware

Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence

Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, (November 29, 1338 — October 7, 1368), born in Antwerp, was the third son of Edward III. When he was only a child he was married to Elizabeth de Burgh (d.1363), daughter of William de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster (d.1332). The ceremony took place on August 15, 1342, at the Tower of London. He became properly married to her in 1352, when he was aged 14, and took over all her lands in Ireland. The famous English poet, Geoffrey Chaucer, was a page to Elizabeth.

He was Edward III's representative in England and in 1355 he was made the Earl of Ulster. He went to Dublin in 1361 to be the Chief Governor of Ireland. His father made him Duke of Clarence in 1362, and tried to have him made King of Scotland. Lionel and the government in Dublin were concerned about how the English settlers in Ireland were slowly become Irish. He brought in laws, the Statute of Kilkenny, in 1366, which made it against the law:

Lionel found it difficult to get control over Ireland and went back to England in 1367.

After the death of Elizabeth, Lionel married Violante, the daughter of Galeazzo Visconti, Lord of Pavia (d.1378), in Milan during June 1368. While travelling around Italy, Lionel became sick and died at Alba on October 7, 1368. He was buried at the Clare Priory, Suffolk, England.

His daughter, Philippa Plantagenet, married Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March (1351-1381), in 1368. This made Lionel an ancestor of Edward IV.

Cross-platform interchange

A cross-platform interchange is a type of interchange between different lines in a railway system.

Northern line

The Northern line is a deep-level tube line on the London Underground, coloured black on the Tube map. It carries more passengers than any other Underground line; 206,734,000 a year.

For most of its length it is a deep-level tube line. The portion between and opened in 1890 and is the oldest section of deep-level tube line on the Underground network. There were about 252 million passenger journeys recorded in 2011/12 on the Northern line, making it the second-busiest on the Underground. (It was the busiest from 2003 to 2010.) It is unique in having two different routes through central London. Despite its name, it does not serve the northern-most stations on the network, though it does serve the southern-most station, Morden, as well as 16 of the system's 29 stations south of the River Thames. There are 50 stations in total on the line, of which 36 have platforms below ground.

The line has a complicated history, and the current complex arrangement of two main northern branches, two central branches and the southern route reflects its genesis as three separate railways, combined in the 1920s and 1930s. An extension in the 1920s used a route originally planned by a fourth company. Abandoned plans from the 1920s to extend the line further southwards, and then northwards in the 1930s, would have incorporated parts of the routes of two further companies. From the 1930s to the 1970s, the tracks of a seventh company were also managed as a branch of the Northern line. An extension from Kennington to Battersea is currently under construction, which may either give the Northern line a second southern branch or may see it split into separate distinct lines with their own identities. It is coloured black on the current Tube map.

The City and South London Railway (C&SLR) was the first deep-level underground "tube" railway in the world, and the first major railway to use electric traction. The railway was originally intended for cable-hauled trains, but owing to the bankruptcy of the cable contractor during construction, a system of electric traction using electric locomotives—an experimental technology at the time—was chosen instead. Given the small dimension of the tunnels as well as the difficulty of providing sufficient ventilation, steam power, as used on London's other underground railways, was not feasible for a deep tube railway. Like Greathead's earlier Tower Subway, the CL&SS was intended to be operated by cable haulage with a static engine pulling the cable through the tunnels at a steady speed. Section 5 of the 1884 Act specified that:

The Patent Cable Tramway Corporation owned the rights to the Hallidie cable-car system first invented and used in San Francisco in 1873; trains were attached to the cable with clamps, which would be opened and closed at stations, allowing the carriages to disconnect and reconnect without needing to stop the cable or to interfere with other trains sharing the cable. There were to be two independent endless cables, one between City station and Elephant and Castle moving at 10 mph, and the other between Elephant and Castle and Stockwell, where the gradient was less, at 12 mph. However, the additional length of tunnel permitted by the supplementary acts challenged the practicality of the cable system.

It is reported that this problem with the CL&SS contributed to the bankruptcy of the cable company in 1888. However, electric motor traction had been considered all along, and much engineering progress had been made since the tunnel's construction had begun in 1886. So, CL&SS chairman Charles Grey Mott decided to switch to electric traction. Other cable-operated systems using the Hallidie patents continued to be designed, such as the Glasgow Subway which opened in 1896.
The solution adopted was electrical power, provided via a third rail beneath the train, but offset to the west of centre for clearance reasons. Although the use of electricity to power trains had been experimented with during the previous decade, and small-scale operations had been implemented, the C&SLR was the first major railway in the world to adopt it as a means of motive power. The system operated using electric locomotives built by Mather & Platt collecting a voltage of 500 volts (actually +500 volts in the northbound tunnel and −500 volts in the southbound) from the third rail and pulling several carriages. A depot and generating station were constructed at Stockwell. Owing to the limited capacity of the generators, the stations were originally illuminated by gas. The depot was on the surface, and trains requiring maintenance were initially hauled up via a ramp although, following a runaway accident, a lift was soon installed. In practice, most rolling stock and locomotives went to the surface only for major maintenance.

To avoid the need to purchase agreements for running under surface buildings, the tunnels were bored below roadways, where construction could be carried out without charge. At the northern end of the railway, the need to pass deep beneath the bed of the River Thames and the medieval street pattern of the City of London constrained the arrangement of the tunnels on the approach to King William Street station. Because of the proximity of the station to the river, steeply inclined tunnels were required to the west of the station. Because of the narrow street under which they ran, they were bored one above the other rather than side by side as elsewhere. The outbound tunnel was the lower and steeper of the two. The tunnels converged immediately before the station, which was in one large tunnel and comprised a single track with a platform on each side. The other terminus at Stockwell was also constructed in a single tunnel but with tracks on each side of a central platform.

When opened in 1890, the line had six stations and ran for in a pair of tunnels between the City of London and Stockwell, passing under the River Thames:
The original service was operated by trains composed of an engine and three carriages. Thirty-two passengers could be accommodated in each carriage, which had longitudinal bench seating and sliding doors at the ends, leading onto a platform for boarding and alighting. It was reasoned that there was nothing to look at in the tunnels, so the only windows were in a narrow band high up in the carriage sides. Gate-men rode on the carriage platforms to operate the lattice gates and announce the station names to the passengers. Because of their claustrophobic interiors, the carriages soon became known as "padded cells". These trains were however, preserved in London Transport Museum as the first static exhibit to the metro train.

The diameter of the tunnels restricted the size of the trains, and the small carriages with their high-backed seating were nicknamed "padded cells". The railway was extended several times north and south, eventually serving 22 stations over a distance of from Camden Town in north London to Morden in Surrey.

Although the C&SLR was well used, low ticket prices and the construction cost of the extensions placed a strain on the company's finances. In 1913, the C&SLR became part of the Underground Group of railways and, in the 1920s, it underwent major reconstruction works before its merger with another of the Group's railways, the Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway, forming a single London Underground line called the Morden-Edgware line. In 1933, the C&SLR and the rest of the Underground Group was taken into public ownership. Today, its tunnels and stations form the Bank Branch of the Northern line from Camden Town to Kennington and the southern leg of the line from Kennington to Morden.
The CCE&HR (commonly known as the "Hampstead Tube") was opened in 1907 and ran from Charing Cross (known for many years as Strand) via Euston and Camden Town (where there was a junction) to Golders Green and Highgate (now known as Archway). It was extended south by one stop to Embankment in 1914 to form an interchange with the Bakerloo and District lines. In 1913 the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), owner of the CCE&HR, took over the C&SLR, although they remained separate companies.

During the early 1920s, a series of works was carried out to connect the C&SLR and CCE&HR tunnels to enable an integrated service to be operated. The first of these new tunnels, between the C&SLR's Euston station and the CCE&HR's station at Camden Town, had originally been planned in 1912 but had been delayed by World War I. The second connection linked the CCE&HR's Embankment and C&SLR's Kennington stations and provided a new intermediate station at Waterloo to connect to the main line station there and the Bakerloo line. The smaller-diameter tunnels of the C&SLR were expanded to match the standard diameter of the CCE&HR and the other deep tube lines.

In conjunction with the works to integrate the two lines, two major extensions were undertaken: northwards to Edgware in Middlesex (now in the London Borough of Barnet) and southwards to Morden in Surrey (then in the Merton and Morden Urban District, but now in the London Borough of Merton).

The Edgware extension used plans dating back to 1901 for the Edgware and Hampstead Railway (E&HR) which the UERL had taken over in 1912. It extended the CCE&HR line from its terminus at Golders Green to Edgware in two stages: to Hendon Central in 1923 and to Edgware in 1924. The line crossed open countryside and ran on the surface, apart from a short tunnel north of Hendon Central. Five new stations were built to pavilion-style designs by Stanley Heaps, head of the Underground's Architects Office, stimulating the rapid northward expansion of suburban developments in the following years.

The engineering of the Morden extension of the C&SLR from Clapham Common to Morden was more demanding, running in tunnels to a point just north of Morden station, which was constructed in a cutting. The line then runs under the wide station forecourt and public road outside the station, to the depot. The extension was initially planned to continue to Sutton over part of the route for the unbuilt Wimbledon and Sutton Railway, in which the UERL held a stake, but agreements were made with the Southern Railway to end the extension at Morden. The Southern Railway later built the surface line from Wimbledon to Sutton, via South Merton and St. Helier. The tube extension opened in 1926, with seven new stations, all designed by Charles Holden in a modern style. Originally, Stanley Heaps was to design the stations, but after seeing these designs Frank Pick, Assistant Joint Manager of the UERL, decided Holden should take over the project. With the exception of Morden and Clapham South, where more land was available, the new stations were built on confined corner sites at main road junctions in areas that had been already developed. Holden made good use of this limited space and designed impressive buildings. The street-level structures are of white Portland stone with tall double-height ticket halls, with the famous London Underground roundel made up in coloured glass panels in large glazed screens. The stone columns framing the glass screens are surmounted by a capital formed as a three-dimensional version of the roundel. The large expanses of glass above the entrances ensure that the ticket halls are bright and, lit from within at night, welcoming. The first and last new stations on the extension, Clapham South and Morden, include a parade of shops and were designed with structures capable of being built above (like many of the earlier central London stations). Clapham South was extended upwards soon after its construction with a block of apartments; Morden was extended upwards in the 1960s with a block of offices. All the stations on the extension, except Morden itself, are Grade II listed buildings.

The resulting line became known as the "Morden–Edgware line", although a number of alternative names were also mooted in the fashion of the contraction of Baker Street & Waterloo Railway to "Bakerloo", such as "Edgmor", "Mordenware", "Medgway" and "Edgmorden". With Egyptology very much in fashion after the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922, there was also a proposal to call the line the Tootancamden Line as it passed through both Tooting and Camden. It was eventually named the "Northern line" from 28 August 1937, reflecting the planned addition of the Northern Heights lines.

After the UERL and the Metropolitan Railway (MR) were brought under public control in the form of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) in 1933, the MR's subsidiary, the Great Northern & City Railway, which ran from Moorgate to Finsbury Park, became part of the Underground as the Northern City Line. In preparation for the Northern Heights Plan, it was operated as part of the Northern line, although it was never connected to it.

In June 1935, the LPTB announced the New Works Programme, an ambitious plan to expand the Underground network which included the integration of a complex of existing London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) lines north of Highgate through the Northern Heights. These lines, built in the 1860s and 1870s by the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway (EH&LR) and its successors, ran from Finsbury Park to Edgware via Highgate, with branches to Alexandra Palace and High Barnet. The line taken over would be extended beyond Edgware to Brockley Hill, Elstree South and Bushey Heath with a new depot at Aldenham. The extension's route was that planned for the unbuilt Watford and Edgware Railway (W&ER), using rights obtained from the earlier purchase of the W&ER (which had long intended an extension of the EH&LR Edgware route towards Watford). This also provided the potential for further extension in the future; Bushey's town planners reserved space in Bushey village for a future station and Bushey Heath station's design was revised several times to ensure this option would remain available in the future.

The project involved electrification of the surface lines (operated by steam trains at the time), the doubling of the original single-line section between Finchley Central and the proposed junction with the Edgware branch of the Northern line, and the construction of three new linking sections of track: a connection between Northern City Line and Finsbury Park station on the surface; an extension from Archway to the LNER line near East Finchley via new deep-level platforms below Highgate station; and a short diversion from just before the LNER's Edgware station to the Underground's station of the same name.

The peak-hour service pattern was to be 21 trains an hour each way on the High Barnet branch north of Camden Town, 14 of them via the Charing Cross branch and seven via the Bank branch. 14 would have continued on beyond Finchley Central, seven each on the High Barnet and Edgware branches. An additional seven trains an hour would have served the High Barnet branch, but continued via Highgate High-Level and Finsbury Park to Moorgate, a slightly shorter route to the City. It does not seem to have been intended to run through trains to the ex-Northern City branch from Edgware via Finchley Central. Seven trains an hour would have served the Alexandra Palace branch, to/from Moorgate via Highgate High-Level. In addition to the 14 through trains described, the ex-Northern City branch would have had 14 four-car shuttle trains an hour.

Work began in the late 1930s, and was in progress on all fronts by the outbreak of World War II. The tunnelling northwards from the original Highgate station (now Archway) had been completed, and the service to the rebuilt surface station at East Finchley started on 3 July 1939, but without the opening of the intermediate (new) Highgate Station, at the site of the LNER's station of the same name. Further progress was disrupted by the start of the war, though enough had been made to complete the electrification of the High Barnet branch onwards from East Finchley over which tube services started on 14 April 1940; the new (deep-level) Highgate station opened on 19 January 1941. The single track LNER line to Edgware was electrified as far as Mill Hill East, including the Dollis Brook Viaduct, opening as a tube service on 18 May 1941 to serve the barracks there, thus forming the Northern line as it is today. The new depot at Aldenham had already been built and was used to build Halifax bombers. Work on the other elements of the plan was suspended late in 1939.

Preparatory work including viaducts and a tunnel had been started but not completed on the Bushey extension pre-war. After the war, the area beyond Edgware was made part of the Metropolitan Green Belt, largely preventing the anticipated residential development in the area, and the potential demand for services from Bushey Heath thus vanished. Available funds were directed towards completing the eastern extension of the Central line instead, and the Northern Heights plan was dropped on 9 February 1954. Aldenham depot was converted into an overhaul facility for buses.

The implemented service from High Barnet branch gave good access both to the West End and the City. This appears to have undermined traffic on the Alexandra Palace branch, still run with steam haulage to Kings Cross via Finsbury Park, as Highgate (low-level) was but a short bus ride away and car traffic was much lighter than it would become later. Consequently, the line from Finsbury Park to Muswell Hill and Alexandra Palace via the surface platforms at Highgate was closed altogether to passenger traffic in 1954. This contrasts with the decision to electrify the Epping-Ongar branch of the Central line, another remnant of the New Works programme, run as a tube-train shuttle from 1957. A local pressure group, the Muswell Hill Metro Group, campaigns to reopen this route as a light-rail service. So far there is no sign of movement on this issue: the route, now the Parkland Walk, is highly valued by walkers and cyclists, and suggestions in the 1990s that it could, in part, become a road were met with fierce opposition. Another pressure group has proposed using the track bed further north, as part of the North and West London Light Railway. The connection between Drayton Park and the surface platforms at Finsbury Park was opened in 1976, when the Northern City Line became part of British Rail.

In 1975, the Northern City Line, known by that time as the Highbury branch, was transferred from London Underground to British Rail; it is now served by Great Northern. In the past, before the introduction of the 1995 stock, the Northern line was sometimes nicknamed the "Misery Line" in the press because of its perceived unreliability.

In 2003, a train derailed at Camden Town. Although no one was hurt, points, signals and carriages were damaged, and the junctions there were not used while repairs were under way: trains coming from Edgware worked the Bank branch only, and trains from High Barnet and Mill Hill East worked the Charing Cross branch only. This situation was resolved when the junctions reopened, after much repair work and safety analysis and testing by contractor, on 7 March 2004.

On 7 July 2005 a defective train on the Northern line (causing its subsequent suspension) saved a Northern line train from being blown up as part of a terrorist attack on the London Underground and bus systems. Three trains on the Circle and Piccadilly lines were blown up. The Northern line bomber-to-be instead boarded a bus, which he later blew up.

On 13 October 2005 the Northern line service was suspended due to maintenance problems with the emergency braking system on the entire train fleet. A series of rail replacement buses was used to connect outlying stations with other Underground lines. Full service was restored on 18 October.

From June 2006, the service between East Finchley and Camden Town was suspended for two non-consecutive weekends every month, with service on the Edgware branch suspended for the other two weeks. This was part of Tube Lines's redevelopment of some Edgware and High Barnet Branch stations, including replacement of track, signals, as well as station maintenance. This included refurbishment of all High Barnet branch stations from West Finchley to Camden Town. In October 2006, off-peak service between Mill Hill East and Finchley Central was cut back to a shuttle, except for a few weekend through trains.

On 13 August 2010, a defective rail maintenance train caused disruption on the Charing Cross branch, after it travelled four miles in 13 minutes without a driver. The train was being towed to the depot after becoming faulty. At Archway station, the defective train became detached and ran driverless until coming to a stop at an incline near Warren Street station. This caused morning rush-hour services to be suspended on this branch. All passenger trains were diverted via the Bank branch, with several not stopping at stations until they were safely on the Bank branch.

The Northern line was originally scheduled to switch to automatic train operation in 2012, using the same SelTrac S40 system as used since 2009 on the Jubilee line and for a number of years on the Docklands Light Railway. Originally the work was to follow on from the Jubilee line so as to benefit from the experience of installing it there, but that project was not completed until spring 2011. Work on the Northern line was contracted to be completed before the 2012 Olympics. It is now being undertaken in-house, and TfL predicted the upgrade would be complete by the end of 2014. The first section of the line (West Finchley to High Barnet) was transferred to the new signalling system on 26 February 2013 and the line became fully automated on 1 June 2014 with the Chalk Farm to Edgware via Golders Green section being the last part of the line to switch to ATO.

Circle Line

Circle Line can mean:


Circle line (London Underground)

The Circle line, coloured yellow on the tube map, is the eighth busiest line on the London Underground. It forms a loop line around the centre of London on the north side of the River Thames. Platforms are 120 metres long in the south and 130 metres long on the part of the track shared with the Metropolitan line.

In 1863 the Metropolitan Railway opened in London between Paddington and Farringdon. It was the world's first underground railway. It connected the Great Western Railway's relatively remote terminus at Paddington with Euston and King's Cross stations and the City, London's financial heart. In the same year a report recommended an 'inner circle' of railway lines between the London termini that had been built or were under construction. In the next year the Metropolitan District Railway (commonly known as the District Railway) was formed to build and operate a railway from South Kensington to Tower Hill. The Metropolitan western extension opened in 1868 from a new station at Paddington to South Kensington. By May 1870 the District railway had opened its line from West Brompton to Blackfriars via Gloucester Road and South Kensington, services being operated at first by the Metropolitan. In 1871 the District had built a terminus at Mansion House, and on 18 November 1876 the Met opened its terminus at Aldgate. Due to conflict between the two companies it took an Act of Parliament before further work was done on the inner circle. In 1882 the Metropolitan extended its line from Aldgate to a temporary station at Tower Hill and the District completed its line to Whitechapel. On 6 October 1884 the temporary station was replaced with a joint station and the inner circle was complete. The Metropolitan provided the clockwise or 'outer rail' trains, the District the 'inner rail' or anti-clockwise.

As well as the inner circle, other routes circumnavigated London, although these were not complete loops. From 1872 the L&NWR began an "outer circle" service from Broad Street to Mansion House via Willesden Junction and Earl's Court, diverting an earlier service that had run to Victoria; and the GWR began a "middle circle" service from Moorgate to Mansion House via Latimer Road and Earl's Court. Both of these routes were cut back to Earl's Court: the "middle circle" in 1900 and the "outer circle" in 1909. The GWR service survived as a shuttle service from the Hammersmith & City line to Addison Road, now Kensington (Olympia), until 1940.

The Midland Railway briefly ran a "super outer circle" from St Pancras to Earl's Court from 1878 to 1880. Today London Overground runs services between Clapham Junction, Willesden Junction and Dalston Junction and between Dalston Junction and Clapham Junction.

Wooden carriages were originally hauled by steam locomotives leading to smoke-filled stations and carriages, unpopular with passengers. At the start of the 20th century the District and Metropolitan were seeing increased competition in central London from the new electric underground tube lines and trams, and conversion to electric traction was seen as the way forward. Experiments were carried out on the Earl's Court to High Street Kensington section, and a jointly-owned six-carriage train began passenger service in 1900. Following this an AC system was suggested, and this was accepted by both parties. However, the District was looking for a way to raise the finance needed and in 1901 found an investor, the American Charles Yerkes. He formed the Underground Electric Railways of London (UERL), and his experience in the United States led him to favour DC, with third-rail pick-up similar to that in use on the City & South London Railway and Central London Railway. After arbitration by the Board of Trade the DC system was taken up, and the railways began electrifying the routes, using multiple-unit stock.

The District and Metropolitan Railways bought different designs of electric multiple unit. Both had open saloons; the Metropolitan trains with gated ends, the District B Stock with sliding doors in the middle of each car. When their introduction was attempted on 1 July 1905, a Metropolitan train overturned the third rail on the District Railway, requiring all Metropolitan trains to be modified before running again on the District lines. Full electric service started on 24 September, initially with 6-car trains, later reduced to 4-car. The Metropolitan trains were soon modified to enclose the gated end and eventually to add sliding doors in the middle. Trains were increased to 5 cars in 1918 and the Metropolitan introduced new stock in 1921, with three pairs of sliding double doors on trailer cars. In 1926 the Metropolitan took over all inner circle workings except for three trains on Sundays.

On 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan and the District Railways were amalgamated with other Underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board. Metropolitan Railway electric multiple units were refurbished in 1934 at Acton Works to become eighteen 5-car trains of Circle Stock, at first painted red and cream, later painted red all over to reduce costs. These trains included first-class accommodation, but this was downgraded in 1940. From 1947 these were replaced by 5-car trains of O and P Stock, with doors remotely operated by the guard, released by the transfer of F Stock to the Uxbridge line. The 1933 London Underground Beck map shows a Metropolitan line north of and stations and a District line south of these points. On the 1947 map the Metropolitan and District lines were shown together in the same colour and two years later in 1949 the Circle line was shown separately on the map.

In 1959–1960 Circle line trains were increased to 6 cars, the same length as those operating on the Hammersmith & City line, and the stock of the two lines was integrated with maintenance concentrated at Hammersmith depot, allowing Neasden depot to concentrate on the new A Stock. Aluminium C Stock trains, with public address systems and originally unpainted, replaced these trains from 1970. One person operation of the trains was proposed in 1972 but, due to conflict with the trade unions, was not introduced until 1984. In 2003, the infrastructure of the Circle line was partly privatised in a public–private partnership, managed by the Metronet consortium. Metronet went into administration in 2007 and the local government body Transport for London took over responsibilities.

On 7 July 2005, at about 08:50, bombs exploded on two Circle line trains. One was travelling between Liverpool Street and Aldgate and the other was at Edgware Road. The bombs killed 15 people, including the two suicide bombers. Following the attacks, the whole of the Circle line was closed until 8 August.

A day before a ban on drinking alcohol on public transport in London came into force, a party was held on 31 May 2008, mainly on the Circle line. Thousands of people attended and 17 were arrested by police due to disorderly behaviour, eventually causing several stations to be closed.

Prior to 13 December 2009, Circle line trains travelled in both directions around a simple loop with 27 stations and of track. In 2006 there were fourteen trains in service on the line with an interval between trains of  minutes during peak hours and 8 minutes off-peak; the minimum running time around the circle off-peak was  minutes, although timetabled stops at stations extended this.

In December 2009 the Circle line was extended to include the Hammersmith & City route from Edgware Road to Hammersmith. Rather than continuously running around the circle, trains now travel from Hammersmith to Edgware Road, generally going around the circle once before terminating at Edgware Road, and returning via the same route; occasionally, trains may also continue clockwise through Edgware Road to additional stations. The change was made to improve reliability and increase the service frequency on the Hammersmith branch.

The first S7 Stock train entered passenger service on the Hammersmith & City line on 6 July 2012, running a shuttle service between Hammersmith and Moorgate, and first ran on the Circle line on 2 September 2013. By June 2014 all services were provided by S7 Stock trains.

Hammersmith &amp; City line

The Hammersmith & City line, also known as simply the Hammersmity line, is a line of the London Underground, colored salmon pink on the London Underground Map, running between Hammersmith in West London and Barking in East London.

Metropolitan line

The Metropolitan line is part of the London Underground. It is coloured in TfL's Corporate Magenta on the Tube map and in other branding. It was the first underground railway (or subway) in the world, opening on 10 January 1863. Today, part of that section are no longer served by the Metropolitan line, but by the Hammersmith & City, District and Circle lines. The main line runs from Aldgate in the City of London to Amersham, with branch lines to Uxbridge, Watford and Chesham. The line once went as far as Verney junction. After it was bought by the London Passenger Transport Board, the line was first cut back to Aylesbury, then to Amersham

The line runs parallel to Chiltern Railways London to Aylesbury line from Finchley Road to Amersham. Chiltern railways continues to run services to Aylesbury.

The Metropolitan Railway (also known as the Met) was a passenger and goods railway that served London from 1863 to 1933, its main line heading north-west from the City to what were to become the Middlesex suburbs. Its first line connected the mainline railway termini at , and King's Cross to the City, built beneath the New Road using the cut-and-cover method between Paddington and King's Cross, and in tunnel and cuttings beside Farringdon Road from King's Cross to near Smithfield. It opened on 10 January 1863 with gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives, the world's first underground railway. In 1871, when plans were presented for an underground railway in Paris, it was called the "Métropolitain" in imitation. The modern word metro is a short form of the French word.

The railway was soon extended from both ends and northwards via a branch from Baker Street. It reached Hammersmith in 1864 and Richmond in 1877, and completed the "Inner Circle" in 1884, but the most important route became the line north into the Middlesex countryside, where it stimulated the development of new suburbs. Harrow was reached in 1880, and the line extended as far as in Buckinghamshire, more than from Baker Street. From the end of the 19th century, the railway shared tracks with the Great Central Railway route out of Marylebone station.

Electric traction was introduced in 1905 with electric multiple units operating between Uxbridge, Harrow-on-the-Hill and Baker Street. To remove steam and smoke from the tunnels in central London, the railway purchased electric locomotives, exchanged for steam locomotives at Harrow from 1908. In 1910, a seventeen-minute silent film recording was made showing large portions of the journey from Baker Street to Aylesbury and Uxbridge, seen from the cab of a train. The film survives and is publicly available.

Unlike other railways in the London area, the Met developed land for housing, thus benefitting from the increase in the value of its land caused by the building of the railway. After World War I it promoted its housing estates near the railway with the "Metro-land" brand.

To improve services, more powerful electric and steam locomotives were purchased in the 1920s. A short branch opened from Rickmansworth to Watford in 1925. After World War I, the Stanmore branch was built from Wembley Park.

On 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan was amalgamated with other Underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board, and a period of rationalisation followed.
While the Metropolitan was run as an outer suburban route with steam-hauled trains and goods services, the LPTB wished to focus on electrified trains and suburban traffic. Goods services were passed to the London and North Eastern Railway, which also took over the role of providing steam locomotives for trains beyond the end of electrification at Rickmansworth. All services north-west of were withdrawn by 1936 though services returned to between 1943 and 1948.

The 1930s was a period of rapid growth for the north-western suburbs of London, and LPTB developed ambitious plans to simplify the Metropolitan line and expand capacity. Several stations on the Uxbridge branch were rebuilt, replacing temporary wooden buildings with modernist designs and giving Uxbridge station a new site in the town centre. A major bottleneck in the line, the double-track tunnel from Baker Street to Finchley Road, was bypassed by boring two tube tunnels underneath the Metropolitan tunnels, transferring slow services and the Stanmore branch to the Bakerloo line. (This route was transferred to the Jubilee line in 1979.) In 1936 the line was extended east from to along the tracks of the District line. London Transport inherited a number of incompatible electric multiple units from the railway, including the 1927–33 multiple-unit compartment stock used on routes to Watford and Rickmansworth, and these were refurbished to form a uniform fleet and designated London Underground T Stock. In the 1950s, F Stock trains, with sliding doors under the control of the guard, were transferred from the District line; these mainly worked the semi-fast Harrow and Uxbridge services.

A major rebuilding of the main line from Wembley Park to Amersham was planned in the 1930s but delayed by the war. The line from Wembley to Harrow was rebuilt immediately after the war and the project was completed from 1956–1962, on a more modest scale than originally planned. Until 1961, passenger trains continued to be attached to a steam locomotive at to run to Aylesbury. The rebuilding electrified the line from Rickmansworth to Amersham, transferring all Aylesbury services to British Railways. A pair of fast lines was added from Harrow to north of Moor Park by 1962, allowing outer-suburban trains to run fast to Moor Park. Aluminium A stock, originally unpainted, replaced the T stock and locomotive-hauled trains. More A Stock trains were built in 1962–63 to replace the trains on the Uxbridge service, giving the main line a single train type for all services. A Stock was 4-car units that could operate as four- or eight-car trains; normally operated as eight cars, a 4-car unit operated the Chesham shuttle. One person operation of the trains was proposed in 1972, but due to conflict with the trades unions was not introduced on the line until 1986.

Although the East London line had been an isolated shuttle since 1939, it was shown on London Underground maps as part of the Metropolitan line until 1968. In 1970 it was shown with a thin white line in the middle and labelled the "East London section". By the 1985 map it had become the "East London Line", remaining the same colour as the Metropolitan line with a white line in the middle, changed to orange by the 1990 map. In 1990 the Hammersmith & City line became a separate line from Hammersmith to Whitechapel (Barking during the peak), the Metropolitan line being from Aldgate to Baker Street and northwards to Amersham with branches to Chesham, Uxbridge and Watford.

In 2003, the infrastructure was partly privatised in a public–private partnership managed by the Metronet consortium. Metronet went into administration in 2007 and Transport for London took over responsibilities in the end. Tube Lines was later acquired by TfL in 2011, and managed as owner-designer firm.

On 12 December 2010 the service to Amersham was reduced from four trains per hour to two, and a direct service between Chesham and central London was introduced, replacing the 4-car Chesham to Chalfont & Latimer shuttle. The final passenger services operated by the A Stock ran on 26 September 2012, followed by a ticketed public railtour on 29 September.

Statute of Kilkenny

The Statute of Kilkenny were a set of laws made by the English in 1367 to try and save the English colony in Ireland. The laws were made by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence. They were passed at a meeting of the Irish parliament held at Kilkenny.

The English had difficulty in taking over Ireland. The first English settlers, the Anglo-Irish, began to become Irish in the way they viewed the world. They began to put their own interests ahead of those of the English royalty. The government of Ireland had become weak after the battles with Edward Bruce, and the arrival of the Black Death weakened the country even more. Edward III of England became concerned that the Anglo-Irish were becoming too powerful and threatened his rights and interests in Ireland. He attempted three times to control their increasing independence.

Edward III finally sent his third son, Lionel of Antwerp, to Ireland to try and get back control. He was very concerned that the Anglo-Irish had become more Irish than the Irish themselves. The Statute of Kilkenny were laws designed to bring Ireland back under the control of English born nobles, not English descendants in Ireland. These laws were serious, to break one was seen as treason and could be punished by death. Despite this, after ten years the statutes were dead in the water as a lack of enforcement saw things continue on as they had before.

The Statute of Kilkenny had a lot of laws made to separate the English from the Irish. It was against the law for the English in Ireland to:

Because of the weak government, they were not able to make people obey the new laws, and the Anglo-Irish ignored them.

Tramlink

Tramlink (also called Croydon Tramlink) is a tramway system in south London in the United Kingdom which began operation in May 2000. The service is operated by First London on behalf of Transport for London (TfL). The TfL team responsible for Tramlink is called London Tramlink, matching London Buses, London Underground, and so on.

Docklands Light Railway

The Docklands Light Railway (DLR) is a light metro or light rail system in London, England. It opened on 31 August 1987 to serve the redeveloped Docklands area of East London. It currently covers several areas of London. To the north, it reaches Stratford. To the south, Lewisham. To the west, Tower Gateway and Bank in the City of London financial district. To the east, Beckton, London City Airport and Woolwich Arsenal. The DLR is fully computer operated. It is automated and the only job is the emergency stop button.

London Overground

The London Overground (LO) is a suburban rail system in London, UK run by Arriva and MTR for Transport for London. The London Overground is made up of 9 lines taken over by TFL. It is coloured orange on the Tube map. It serves a lot of Greater London.


All lines can be used with the Oyster card used across London. The London Overground has received praise for its transformation of long-neglected lines into clean and reliable services, with passenger usage increasing sharply such that trains had to be extended from 3 cars in 2007 to 5 cars in 2015. In the autumn 2011 National Passenger Survey, London Overground received an overall satisfaction rating of 92%, a 7% improvement on the previous survey.

First Capital Connect

First Capital Connect (FCC) was a train company in England that ran the Thameslink railway line between Brighton and Bedford and services along the East Coast Main Line from King's Cross and Peterborough, Cambridge, and King's Lynn from 1 April 2006 to 13 September 2014. It was owned by First Group and combines the service on formerly operated by WAGN, often referred to as Great Northern. It failed to keep the franchise, and it was succeeded by Thameslink and Great Northern.

Northern City Line

The Northern City Line is a railway line from Moorgate to Finsbury Park in London, once part of the Great Northern Electrics line. It should not be confused with the City branch of the Northern line, nor with the North London line.

Upper Austria

Upper Austria ( ; ) is one of the nine states or "Bundesländer" of Austria. The capital of this state is Linz.

Upper Austria borders on Germany and the Czech Republic, as well as on the other Austrian states of Lower Austria, Styria, and Salzburg. With an area of 11,980 km and 1.3 million people, Upper Austria is the fourth-largest Austrian state by land area and third-largest by population.


Most of the large lakes of Upper Austria are in the south (Salzkammergut): Almsee, Attersee, die Gosauseen, Hallstätter See, Irrsee, Langbathseen, Mondsee, Offensee, Traunsee and Wolfgangsee. In the Oberinnviertler Seenplatte on the border with Salzburg, there are small lakes which are very warm in summer: Holzöstersee, Höllerer See, and Ibmer See.

Ager, Alm, Aschach, Donau, Enns, Inn, Krems, Große Mühl, Kleine Mühl, Naarn, Rodl, Salzach, Steyr, Traun, Aist, Antiesen, and Trattnach.

Traditionally the state is divided into four quarters:
Upper Austria has three cities with their own charta:
The country is divided into 15 districts:


Lambach

Lambach is a market town in the Wels-Land district of Upper Austria, Austria. It is on the Ager and Traun Rivers. It had about 3,242 peopleas of 2001. A major stop on the salt trade, it is the site of the Lambach Abbey, built around 1056.

Between 1897 and 1898 lived Adolf Hitler there and attented the school.

Tracheotomy

Tracheotomy and tracheostomy is a surgery on the neck to open a direct path by cutting a hole in the trachea (windpipe). They are performed by paramedics, veterinarians, emergency physicians, and surgeons. Both surgical and percutaneous techniques are now widely used.

Tracheostomy was written about in ancient Egyptian tablets, but, in the 12th century, Ibn Zuhr described the first correct tracheotomy operation for people who were suffocating (could not breathe). The current tracheostomy was described in 1909 by Chevalier Jackson, an American doctor.


Leonding

Leonding is a city southwest of Linz in the Austrian state of Upper Austria, in Austria. In 2001, about 22,269 people lived in Leonding. It covers an area of 24.05 km² (9.28 mi²).

Gefreiter

Gefreiter is a German, Swiss and Austrian military rank. The rank of "Gefreiter" is usually the second rank or grade to which an enlisted soldier, airman or sailor could be promoted. As a military rank it has existed since the 16th century. From the 1920s on, "Gefreiter" has expanded into several additional ranks, those being "Obergefreiter", "Hauptgefreiter", "Stabsgefreiter" and "Oberstabsgefreiter". 

A similar military rank also exists in Russia ("Ефрейтор"; yefreytor, efreitor), Ukraine ("Єфрейтор"; yefreytor, efreitor), Belarus and in the former Soviet Union.

Plasma display

Televisions with plasma display panel (PDP) are much thinner than cathode ray tubes and are usually higher definition. Only a few televisions use a PDP.

Plasma screens are made of two sheets of glass with two gases stored between the sheets. The gases are xenon and neon and they fill thousands of tiny chambers, or spaces. Behind each space are a series of red, blue and green phosphors that give off light when struck by radiation. When electricity connects to the plasma chambers the colored phosphors produce the right color on your screen. They work in a very similar way to fluorescent lamps used for lighting.

Plasma screens have been in use since 1964 but only two colors could be produced then. Now we have high definition Plasma screens up to 150 inches in size. In the early 21st century fewer plasma screens were made as people bought more liquid crystal displays.

Plasma TVs have more pixels (tiny dots that when put together can create an image on a picture) per inch than the old fashioned cathode ray tube (CRT) screens so they can produce a much sharper image. In the old style of CRT screens the pictures were made up of lines. If you look closely at a Plasma screen you will not see any lines. You will find out that most Plasma screens have a wide screen option so you can see movies in the way they were intended for movie theaters. They are also ideal for the latest digital broadcasting methods.

One of the big advantages is the space saving. The problem with old cathode ray tubes is that they needed a lot of space so that the rays can fire upon all areas of the screen. The wider the screen, the larger the volume of the television would be. The average Plasma television is around 6 to 8 inches deep. Moving your Plasma onto the wall can really increase the amount of floor space and they can be looked at from almost any point in the room (usually 180 degrees)

Plasma screens are also very light especially when compared to a rear projection TV. A 40-inch Plasma TV will weigh from and provided you purchase a suitable bracket (that can hold the TV up to the wall) they can be hung very easily to a suitable wall. When fixing to the wall you need to make sure you choose a bracket which s strong enough. Most brackets can be tilted if you want to view from a different angle.

Plasma TVs can display up to 16 million colors so not only are they great for watching TV programs, they also make a good screen for the latest computer games consoles. Most Plasma TV's have inputs for HDMI and laptop computers connections making them ideal to use to display products and sales messages in offices and shops.

You will also find out that they are very easy to watch even on a sunny day or a very bright room. Unlike the old CRT screens they are not hard to see in bright areas.

Because of the phosphor technology in Plasma TVs, it is possible for traces of an image to be 'burned-in' to the display, meaning you might see little traces of it even while watching other images. This is a concern in commercial uses, where images are shown for long periods of time. Burn-in can generally be avoided by making sure the screen does not show the same image for a long time (sometimes as little as 20 minutes), either by turning the television off, or changing the channel.

Though Plasma TVs are much brighter than rear-projection TVs, direct view and LCD TVs are often brighter still. Latest generation Plasma TVs have improved on brightness, but a warning is do not view where it is too bright or sunny.

Although Plasma TVs are much lighter and thinner than direct view and rear projection TVs, an LCD TV can be even more light and slim. LCD TVs use the same technology as used in most laptop computers. Plasma TVs are available in larger sizes that LCD TVs. Plasma screen TVs cost more than CRTs and LCDs.

Compared to other television technologies, Plasma TVs have a shorter life span. Most Plasma TVs have a life span of 20,000-30,000 hours based on maker's estimates. This life span is commonly referred to as the Plasma TV half-life, as it is the number of hours over which the Plasma TV will lose approximately half of its brightness.

Plasma TVs break easily, and the parts are quite easy to damage. They should only be moved carefully.

As technology has been made better, Plasma screens have a much longer life and you should expect 30,000 hours of use. In other words, your television would need to be on for 16 hours a day, every day for the next 5 years. By the time your TV needs replacing higher definition models will have become available.

The first Plasma televisions for home use were expensive, as much as US$5000 for a basic small model. As the technology improved and production increased, prices became smaller. In the 21st century some 37-inch models sold for $1000 or even less. Buying a CRT television became rare as LCD became the usual kind.

Surrender (military)

Surrender is when soldiers, nations or other combatants stop fighting and eventually become prisoners of war or POW, either as individuals or when ordered to by their officers. A white flag is a common symbol of surrender. Surrender usually occurs when one side of a battle happens to be overpowered by the other and are no longer in the condition to fight any more.

On May 10, 2013, the last piece of the skyscraper's antenna was put on, making the building's height 1,776 feet (541 m). The height of the building was done on purpose to refer to the year when the Declaration of Independence was signed, 1776.

On March 26, 2009, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) said that the building would be officially known by its legal name of "One World Trade Center", rather than its colloquial name of "Freedom Tower". The building has 94 stories, with the top floor numbered 104.

The new World Trade Center complex will have five high-rise office buildings built. The National September 11 Memorial & Museum, located just south of One World Trade Center where the original Twin Towers stood, was also built. The construction of the new building is part of an effort to memorialize and rebuild following the destruction of the original World Trade Center complex.

On November 8, 2013, architects in Chicago and New York City began debating about the height of the One World Trade Center and the Willis Tower. They were saying that there was a possibility that the Willis Tower is taller than the One World Trade Center.

On November 12, a committee agreed that the antenna on top is part of the building, so One World Trade Center is taller than the Willis Tower.

Even after removing the antennas from the measurement, One World Trade Center is about 325 feet (99 m) taller than the Willis Tower.

Fashion design

Fashion design is the art and profession of designing clothes, costume and related items like hats, purses, bags and shoes.

Fashion designers attempt to design clothes which are functional as well as attractive. They consider who is likely to wear a garment and the situations in which it will be worn. They have a range of materials to work with and a wide range of colors, patterns and styles to choose from. 

Some clothes are made specifically for an individual, as in the case of haute couture or bespoke tailoring. Today, most clothing is designed for the mass market, especially casual and every-day wear.

Fashion design started in the 19th century with Charles Frederick Worth, who was the first designer to have his label sewn into the garments he created. Worth's success was such that he was able to dictate to his customers what they should wear, instead of following their lead as earlier dressmakers had done. The term "couturier" was in fact first created in order to describe him. While all articles of clothing from any time period are studied by academics as costume design, only clothing created after 1858 is considered fashion design.

During this period many design houses began to hire artists to sketch or paint designs for garments. The images were shown to clients, which was much cheaper than producing an actual sample garment in the workroom. If the client liked their design, they ordered it and the resulting garment made money for the house. Thus, the tradition of designers sketching out garment designs began as an economy.

The garments produced by clothing manufacturers fall into three main categories, although these may be split up into additional, more specific categories

Until the 1950s, fashion clothing was predominately designed and manufactured on a made-to-measure or haute couture basis. Each garment was made for a specific client. A couture garment is made to order for an individual customer, and is usually made from high-quality, expensive fabric, sewn with extreme attention to detail and finish, often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques. Look and fit take priority over the cost of materials and the time it takes to make. Due to the high cost of each garment, haute couture makes little direct profit for the fashion houses, but is important for prestige and publicity.

Ready-to-wear clothes have elements of haute couture and mass market. They are not made for individual customers, but great care is taken in the choice and cut of the fabric. Clothes are made in small quantities to guarantee exclusivity, so they are rather expensive. Ready-to-wear collections are usually presented by fashion houses each season during a period known as Fashion Week. This takes place on a city-wide basis and occurs twice a year. The main seasons of Fashion Week include, spring/summer, fall/winter, resort, swim, and bridal.

Currently the fashion industry relies more on mass market sales. The mass market caters for a wide range of customers, producing ready-to-wear garments using trends set by the famous names in fashion. They often wait around a season to make sure a style is going to catch on before producing their own versions of the original look. In order to save money and time, they use cheaper fabrics and simpler production techniques which can easily be done by machine. The end product can therefore be sold much more cheaply.

Word search

A word search is a puzzle that uses words and puts them in a grid. The point of the game is to find all of the words hidden in the grid.

The puzzle consists of a grid of letters that is usually a rectangle or square shape, but different shapes are possible, some that even look like an object like a plant or animal. Besides the grid is a list of words. The letters in the word appear in order somewhere in the grid, and can be placed horizontally, vertically or diagonally. A letter in the grid can be used in more than one word, and not all the letters in the grid have to appear in a word.

To solve the puzzle, a person has to find the place where each word is hidden in the grid, and when he or she finds that place, he or she circles all the letters in the word (as shown in the example), and then crosses the word off the list so that he or she knows not to look for that word again. It is easier to find the bigger words first since they have more letters.

Many word search puzzles have a theme, so all the hidden words are related. Sometimes, once all the words have been found, the letters which have not been used in any of the words (that is, the letters which have not been circled at least once) spell another word or even a short message. An example of a word search with both a theme and a word made up of unused letters is .

Like other puzzles, word searches are commonly found in newspapers and magazines, which print a different puzzle every day and show the solution in another place or in the next issue. There are also books containing collections of these puzzles, and they can also be played over the Internet or using mobile apps.

Alfred, Lord Tennyson

Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, FRS (6 August 1809 – 6 October 1892) was Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom in the Victorian era. He remains one of the most popular poets in the English language.

Tennyson was excellent at writing short lyrics like "In the valley of Cauteretz", "Break, break, break", "The Charge of the Light Brigade", "Tears, idle tears" and "Crossing the Bar". Much of his verse like The Lotus Eaters was based on classical mythological themes. Tennyson also wrote some notable blank verse including "Idylls of the King", "Ulysses", and "Tithonus". During his career, Tennyson attempted drama, but his plays were not very successful.

"In Memoriam A.H.H." was a poem by Tennyson, written in memory of his best friend Arthur Hallam. Hallam was a fellow poet and classmate at Trinity College, Cambridge. He had been engaged to Tennyson's sister, but died from a cerebral hemorrhage before they could get married.

The poem was published after Tennyson had read a pro-evolution book by Robert Chambers. The fundamentalist idea of Biblical inerrancy was in conflict with science. Tennyson expressed the difficulties evolution raised for faith in "the truths that never can be proved".

The poem is too long to quote in full, but this shows how he was thinking of the living world:

The much-quoted phrase comes soon after, in section 56. It refers to humanity: 
The phrase "Nature, red in tooth and claw" was taken up as a metaphor for life in general, even before Darwin's "Origin of species" was published.

The poem has another, perhaps even better-known stanza:

Edward Downes

Sir Edward Downes, (born Birmingham, England, 17 June 1924; died Switzerland, 10 July 2009) was an English conductor. He was famous for conducting opera, but also conducted orchestral concerts. He worked a lot with the orchestra of the Royal Opera House as well as Opera Australia.

When he was old he was almost totally blind and deaf and his wife was dying of cancer, so they both decided that they wanted to die together. They went to Switzerland where they were allowed to commit assisted suicide.

Downes was born in Birmingham, England. His father worked in a bank. He left school when he was 14 and got a simple job in a gas store where he earned 16s 10d (16 shillings and 10 pence, which is 84p in modern British money) a week. 

He had been playing the piano and violin since he was five. When he was 16 he got a scholarship to the University of Birmingham where he studied English literature and music, and began playing the cor anglais. He then got a scholarship to study conducting at the University of Aberdeen.

In the 1960s, he married Joan, a dancer with the Royal Ballet. She later became a choreographer and television producer. They had two children: a son, Caractacus (born December 1967), who became a musician and recording engineer, and a daughter, Boudicca, who became a video producer.

In 1952 he started his work in the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden where he was assistant to Rafael Kubelík. He worked for the ROH for 17 years, becoming Associate Music Director in 1991. 

From 1970 he was Music Director of Australian Opera. He conducted the first performance in the new Sydney Opera House in 1973 conducting Prokofiev’s opera "War and Peace". He was Chief Conductor of the Netherlands Radio Orchestra and the BBC Philharmonic.

Downes was remembered in particular for conducting music by British composers. He was also especially fond of the operas by Verdi as well as the symphonies of Shostakovich. People often thought he looked like Shostakovich, especially when he wore his glasses.

He received the honour of CBE.

In his last years he could hardly see and so he could only conduct music that he knew from memory.

When he was 85 he had become almost totally blind and deaf. His wife was dying of cancer and was in a lot of pain. They both wanted to die together, but in Britain it is against the law to help someone to die, so they decided to go to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland. There, surrounded by members of their family, they drank a fatal dose of barbiturates and died on 10 July 2009.

Some people who support the idea of assisted suicide are hoping that this case may lead to more discussion which could bring about a change in the law in Britain and other countries.

Assisted suicide

Assisted suicide is when somebody who wants to commit suicide (wants to die) is helped to do this by someone else. Normally, people who ask for assisted suicide are very ill and in a lot of pain, so they want someone to help them to die, for example by being given access to drugs which will kill them. Some people prefer the terms aid in dying or death with dignity to describe assisted suicide. The term euthanasia is sometimes used, although euthanasia is generally regarded as different to assisted suicide, as it involves causing a person to die rather than helping them to kill themselves.

The law about this varies a lot in different countries. In many countries it is not allowed, and the person who helps someone to die may be arrested and sent to prison. Physician-assisted suicide is legal in some countries, under certain circumstances, including Austria, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, 10 states of the United States and all six states of Australia. In general to make it legal the person who wants to die has to show that they are of sound mind, voluntarily and repeatedly expressing their wish to die, and take the specified, lethal dose by their own hand. In 2024 several other countries are talking about making this legal. Jersey and the Isle of Man considering this puts pressure on the United Kingdom to do the same. 

Some people who are very ill and want to die may go to these countries, such as Switzerland, in order to end their life.

Dignitas (Swiss non-profit organisation)

Dignitas is a Swiss group that helps people with assisted suicide. This means that, if a person is very ill and wants to die, the doctors and nurses help them to end their life. Only people who have a terminal illness or very bad physical or mental illnesses are allowed to be helped. The patients must be able to understand what is happening and decide for themselves that death is what they want.

Dignitas was started in 1998 by Ludwig Minelli, a Swiss lawyer. The law in Switzerland says that someone can help in an assisted suicide so long as they do not have any self-interest (for example, so long as they are not going to inherit money from the person who dies). The doctor has to meet the person on two occasions and make sure that the person really does wish to die. There must be evidence for this, i.e. the patient has to sign a paper, and two witnesses have to sign to say they saw the patient signing. If the patient is too ill to sign, a video film can be made. The patient is asked several times whether that is what they want. If everyone is absolutely sure, then he or she is given a drug which will kill them.

Some people travel from other countries such as Britain to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland so that they can be helped to die. For example, the rugby player Daniel James, who was 23, had a terrible injury to his spine which left him paralysed from his chest down, travelled there with his parents to die. In 2009 the British conductor Edward Downes and his wife both travelled to Dignitas where they died together.


Euthanasia

Euthanasia is when a person's life is purposely ended because of disease or pain, which has made them suffer. This is different from assisted suicide, where a person helps someone kill themselves. It is also different to murder, where the reason is not suffering, but to kill for the killer's own ends. Euthanasia can be voluntary, where the person who dies asks for help in ending their life. Where the person is unable to make their decision known, it is usually called "non-voluntary euthanasia". Where someone is killed against their will, it is usually called murder.

Euthanasia is illegal in most countries. It is permitted in a small number of countries, such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Victoria, Australia. The New Zealand Parliament voted 69 - 51 to pass the End of Life choice Bill. In Is it Time to Kill the Kiwi the Rt Hon Simeon Brown said international precedents show that euthanasia regimes result in the involuntary death of innocent lives, often those who are marginalized and vulnerable. The final decision will be made in a binding public referendum. Where it is permitted there are many rules, and only in cases where the patient is terminally ill. Though euthanasia is not legal in the United States, doctors can assist people to kill themselves. This is legal in Washington, Oregon, and Montana. Physician Assisted Suicide (PAD) is different to euthanasia; it is about who gives the medication to end a patient’s life. The World Federation of Right to Die Societies says physician-assisted suicide means "making lethal means available to the patient to be used at a time of the patient’s own choosing." In these cases the patient takes the legal dose of poison themselves, it is not given by the doctor. It is euthanasia when the doctor has the main role in ending the patient’s life by giving the poison. 

Euthanasia can be active or passive, and voluntary, non-voluntary and involuntary. Many people see important differences and they can accept some types but not others.

Passive euthanasia means letting a person die. A terminally ill person is allowed to die, even if treatment could help them to live longer. This includes removing life support, such as a ventilator which is being used to keep the person alive, or by not giving them food or water. Active euthanasia means doing something to end a person's life. This could be giving them an injection or pills that will cause their death.

Some people see passive euthanasia as a more acceptable choice, because it is not a deliberate act to kill. However, others argue that once someone has decided to allow another person to die, they should make it as fast and as painless as possible, and then act to bring about their death. This is also known as mercy killing.

Voluntary euthanasia is when someone asks to be allowed to die or to be killed. This is often seen as the best option by people who believe in euthanasia, because it is clear that the person wants to die. If the person can not say that they want to die, but people think that they would ask to die if they could, then it is "non-voluntary euthanasia." Non-voluntary euthanasia is a choice for people who are in a coma or who are very young, as they can not say what they want. "Involuntary euthanasia" is when someone is killed even though they asked not to die, or when they could have asked to die but did not. Many people think that this is murder, not euthanasia.

These types of euthanasia can be mixed. If someone asks to die, and another person gives them an injection that will kill them, then it is active voluntary euthanasia. Someone in a coma who is kept alive with a ventilator, and the doctors turn it off and they die, would be passive non-voluntary euthanasia.

Some people believe that euthanasia should be allowed, and some people think that it should not.

Some people believe that allowing euthanasia will result in bad things happening. If it is allowed for people asking to die, then it might be allowed for people who are very sick but are not able to ask to die. If that happens, then maybe it would be allowed for people who are very sick and will not recover, but do not want to die. This is called the "slippery slope" argument. 

People who believe in the slippery slope argument point to times when this happened. In Germany, Adolf Hitler allowed disabled children to be killed, and called it euthanasia. People now agree that this was wrong, but if euthanasia was allowed it could happen again. They think it is too big a risk to allow euthanasia at all.

Other people say there is a big difference between killing a very sick person who asks to die, and killing a child with a disability. They do not think euthanasia will lead to bad things. They say that Hitler's actions were not euthanasia.

The American Medical Association (AMA) and other doctors believe it is a doctor's role to help, not kill people. In one study 76% of doctors said they would not carry out euthanasia, even if it was legal. They feel patients would not trust them. In the Netherlands where euthanasia is legal, 60% of older people in one study were scared that their doctors would kill them.

Palliative care is when people who are ill and going to die are given special care to make them more comfortable. It may include hospice care, when the patient is sent to a special hospital for people who are dying. Palliative care can involve pain relief and help for the patient and family to come to terms with death. In some cases, doctors will give patient drugs which make them stay asleep, so that they will not feel pain.

Palliative care is not perfect, and so it is not always seen as a replacement for euthanasia. There is still some pain, and there can be other side-effects, where the patient can still feel very sick. Palliative care is not available for all people, and not all people who wish to die through euthanasia are so sick that they will die soon. Some people have healthy bodies, but they are suffering in other ways, and palliative care will not always help them.

The principle of double effect was first described by Thomas Aquinas over 700 years ago. It says that it is sometimes alright to do a bad thing if something good happens, and if a bad ending was not wanted. Aquinas used the example of self defense: sometimes a person will kill someone who attacks them, but killing was not what the person was trying to do. They only wanted to protect themselves. So even though killing someone is bad, wanting to protect themselves was not.

Some people say that doctors may treat a person to reduce their pain, and as a result the person will die sooner. If the doctor gives the treatment in order to help the patient die, then it is euthanasia. But if the doctor gives the treatment in order to stop the pain, and does not intend for the patient to die, then it may not be euthanasia, even if the doctor knew that the treatment would kill the patient.

Suicide is when a person kills themselves. Sometimes when a person is very sick they need help to die, and this is called assisted suicide. In some countries people are allowed to help as long as they do not kill the person, and it can be seen as a more acceptable option because it must be the person's own decision. Because the assisting person did not kill, it is not always considered to be euthanasia. 


Terminal illness

Terminal illness is a term used to describe an illness which cannot be cured and will almost definitely end in the death of the patient. The term is mostly used for progressive diseases such as cancer or advanced heart disease. Someone who has a terminal illness may be described as a terminal patient or as being terminally ill. Usually a patient is called "terminally ill" when they are not expected to live more than 6 months. Medical conditions such as AIDS are not called terminal illnesses because the patient may live for many years before eventually dying of the illness.

Very often, terminally ill patients are given palliative care to give them a better quality of life. Sometimes, they go to a hospice to be looked after.

Ralph Downes

Ralph William Downes CBE KSG (born Derby, 16 August 1904; died London, 24 December 1993) was an English organist and organ designer.

He was assistant organist at Southwark Cathedral from 1923 until 1925. Then he continued his education at Keble College, Oxford. He was music director and organist of the new chapel at Princeton University between 1928 and 1935. During his time in America he learned a lot about organ building and listened to musicians playing baroque music.

He soon became famous for his recitals and radio broadcasts in which he played music using historical performance styles. He gave first performances of pieces by composers such as Darius Milhaud, Paul Hindemith and Arnold Schoenberg. Benjamin Britten invited him every year to perform at the Aldeburgh Festival.

In 1948, he was asked to design an organ for the new Royal Festival Hall. When the organ was first played in 1954 not everyone agreed that it was good, but soon it was realised that it was an excellent instrument for playing music from the Baroque and Classical music periods and it had a big influence on the way that other organs were built. 

Downes was Professor of Organ at the Royal College of Music from 1954 to 1975 and was the best known British organ teacher of his day. His students included Gillian Weir and Trevor Pinnock. He made many recordings and wrote a book about organ design.

He was given the honour of CBE in 1969. He died in London in 1993. There was no organ music at his funeral. Instead, he had asked for Gregorian chant to be sung.

Symmetry (biology)

Symmetry in biology is about the overall shape of the body and its parts. The body plans of most multicellular organisms have some form of symmetry, radial symmetry, bilateral symmetry or spherical symmetry. A few have no symmetry, and are asymmetric. 

In nature and biology, symmetry is approximate. For example, plant leaves, which are more or less symmetrical, will rarely match up exactly when folded in half.

There are three basic forms:


In nature and biology, symmetry is approximate. For example, plant leaves, while considered symmetric, will rarely match up exactly when folded in half.


William Morris

William Morris (24 March 1834 – 3 October 1896) was an English wallpaper, furniture and fabric designer, artist, writer, and socialist. He was born in Walthamstow in North East London.
Morris was educated at Marlborough and Exeter College, Oxford. In 1856, he became an apprentice to Gothic revival architect G. E. Street but his apprenticeship lasted only about eigth months; thus he never qualified as an architect. That year he founded the "Oxford and Cambridge Magazine". In 1861, Morris founded a design firm in partnership with the artist Edward Burne-Jones, and the poet and artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti. This had a great impact on the decoration of churches and houses in the early 20th century. Morris's major contribution was as a designer of repeating patterns for wallpapers and textiles. This was mainly based on a close observation of nature. He was also a major contributor to the resurgence of traditional textile arts and methods of production.

Morris wrote and published poetry, fiction, and translations of ancient and medieval texts throughout his life, among others "Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs" (1876). His best-known works include "The Defence of Guenevere and Other Poems" (1858), "The Earthly Paradise" (1868–1870), "A Dream of John Ball" (1888) and the utopia "News form Nowhere" (1890). His poetry was strongly influenced by Geoffrey Chaucer's work. This influence can be seen in the use of rhyme royal.
William Morris designed his own furniture. He was frustrated, because he could not find any furniture he liked, so he decided, he wanted to design his own furniture, but it was mostly wallpaper designs.

Morris was an important person in the emergence of socialism in Great Britain. He founded the Socialist League in 1884. However, he broke with the movement over goals and methods by the end of that decade. He devoted much of the rest of his life to the Kelmscott Press, which he founded in 1891. The 1896 Kelmscott edition of the "Works of Geoffrey Chaucer" is considered a masterpiece of book design.


Cliveden

Cliveden is the name of a large house in Buckinghamshire near London, England. There have been three houses on this site. The first house was built in 1666 and burnt to the ground in a fire in 1795. A new house was built but this one also burnt down in a fire in 1849. The house which can be seen today was made in 1851 by Sir Charles Barry, an architect.

Cliveden means "valley among cliffs".

Cliveden House sits in a large garden and woodland, (375 acres). The garden contains many statues and fountains made from stone as well as areas of flowers. Cliveden is very close to the River Thames.

Many famous and important people have lived at Cliveden. Some of these are:

The house is now used as a hotel.

Josef Krips

Josef Krips (born Vienna, 8 April 1902; died Geneva, 13 October 1974) was an Austrian conductor and violinist.

Krips was born into a Jewish family. He became a pupil of Eusebius Mandyczewski and Felix Weingartner. From 1921 to 1924, he was Weingartner's assistant at the Vienna Volksoper where he worked as repetiteur and chorus master. Afterwards he became conductor of several orchestras, including the orchestra in Karlsruhe from 1926 to 1933. In 1933 he returned to Vienna as conductor of the Volksoper. He also became a professor at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts in 1935. He often conducted at the Salzburg Festival between 1935 and 1938.

In 1938, when the Nazi's took power in Austria, (the Anschluss), Krips had to leave the country because he was Jewish and Roman Catholic. He worked in Belgrade until Yugoslavia also became involved in World War II. For the rest of the war he worked in a food factory.

In 1945 he went back to Austria, where he was one of the few conductors who were allowed to work, because he had not worked under the Nazi regime. He was the first person after the war to conduct the Vienna Philharmonic and the Salzburg Festival where he conducted Mozart's opera "Don Giovanni".

From 1950 to 1954 Krips was principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. Afterwards he conducted the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra and the San Francisco Symphony (from 1963 to 1970). He gave his first performance at Covent Garden in 1963 and appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in 1966. From then on he often conducted there. In 1970, he became conductor of the Deutsche Oper in Berlin. Between 1970 and 1973, he was the principal conductor of the Vienna Symphony Orchestra.

Krips died in Geneva, Switzerland in 1974.

His brother Henry was also a musician. He emigrated to Australia where he conducted the orchestra in Adelaide. Then he returned to London where he often conducted Viennese light music.


Répétiteur

A Répétiteur is a musician who helps opera singers to learn their parts for an opera.

The word "Répétiteur" is a French word which comes from the verb "répéter" meaning: "to repeat". The meaning here is "to rehearse", because when a musician rehearses (practises) he will go over the music many times until he has learned it really well. The German word is Korrepetitor.

A répétiteur will be a very skilled musician. He will be an excellent pianist who can play music on the piano which is normally played by an orchestra. He will often be able to help the singer to get to know the music by singing another part that is going on at the same time. He will be able to help the singer with technical problems with their voice, and also with pronunciation and musical interpretation.

Some répétiteurs may go on to become famous conductors, e.g. Josef Krips, Howard Goodall, and Georg Solti.
In ballet, a répétiteur teaches the steps and interpretation of the roles to some or all of the company performing a dance.

Hamilton Harty

Sir Hamilton Harty (born Hillsborough, Co. Down, Ireland, 4 December 1879; died Brighton, 19 February 1941) was an Irish composer, conductor and accompanist. He is particularly remembered for his work in Manchester with the orchestra called The Hallé.

Harty was born in Northern Ireland, the fourth of ten children. His father was a church organist. He learned to play the viola, piano, and organ. When he was twelve he was organist at Magheracoll Church, County Antrim. He also had organist jobs at Belfast and Dublin. In 1900 he went to London where he was soon known as a composer and an excellent piano accompanist. In 1904 he married the singer Agnes Nicholls. For her he wrote a piece for soprano and orchestra called "Ode to a Nightingale".

He soon became known as a conductor, conducting the London Symphony Orchestra and, from 1920, The Hallé, which he made into one of the best orchestras in England.
He conducted works by many composers, some of whom were little known at the time: they included Bax, Sibelius, Berlioz, Moeran, Walton and Richard Strauss. He gave the first performance in England of Mahler’s Ninth Symphony.

Harty was knighted in 1925. He resigned from The Hallé in 1933 after there had been a lot of arguments. After that he mainly conducted in London, as well as in United States and Australia.

Harty composed many pieces during his early years, including "An Irish Symphony", a tone poem "With the Wild Geese", a "Violin Concerto", and "Ode to a Nightingale".

Harty was ill for the last five years of his life. He had a brain tumour. He was looked after by his secretary Olive Baguley, because he had separated from his wife. He died in Hove near Brighton.


Albert Coates

Albert Coates (born Saint Petersburg, 23 April 1882; died Cape Town, 11 December 1953) was an Anglo-Russian conductor and composer.

Coates was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia, the youngest of seven sons of an English father and a Russian mother. 

He studied at the conservatory in Leipzig, where his greatest teacher was Arthur Nikisch. He worked at the opera house in Dresden, and became conductor at Saint Petersburg's Mariinsky Theatre. After the Russian Revolution and World War I he just managed to escape from Russia in April 1919.

He first appeared at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in 1914 conducting Richard Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde". He was a man with a lot of energy, and he introduced the audiences to a lot of music they had not heard, especially by Russian composers such as Alexander Scriabin, but also English music by Ralph Vaughan Williams, Arnold Bax and Gustav Holst, whose suite "The Planets" he gave the first complete London public performance.

In the 1920s and early 1930s he often worked with the London Symphony Orchestra. He made gramophone recordings in the very early days of the gramophone. These include Scriabin's "Poème de l'Extase" and many bits from Wagner's "Der Ring des Nibelungen" and (in 1925) the complete "Symphony No. 9" of Beethoven. He was the conductor for the first recording of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3, with Vladimir Horowitz as soloist. 

In 1925 he gave the first stage performance outside Russia of Rimsky-Korsakov's opera "The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya".

He composed several works including operas and a symphonic poem "The Eagle", dedicated to the memory of his former teacher Artur Nikisch, which was performed in Leeds in 1925. In 1946 he settled in Milnerton, Cape Town, South Africa, where he died in 1953.

Albert Coates was no relation to Eric Coates, the English composer of light music, nor to the tenor John Coates.

Tropical Storm Alma

Tropical Storm Alma was a tropical cyclone in the 2008 Pacific hurricane season. It formed off the coast of Costa Rica on May 29. At first, it was forecast to be a weak storm, However, it quickly gained strength. It then hit land on Nicaragua. 

Alma was the first tropical storm to ever hit the Pacific coast of Nicaragua. Lots of rain from the storm caused flooding, and eleven people were killed in the area. The remains later became Tropical Storm Arthur in the Atlantic.


Herne Hill railway station

Herne Hill railway station is a train station in Herne Hill, a location in the London Borough of Lambeth, South London, England. Its location is . 

Transport for London has thought of making the Victoria line go to Herne Hill to give faster turnaround at the southern end of the line. The extension is not a high thing for TfL as it has a weaker business case than other projects.

The station is looked after by Southeastern train operating company. The off-peak service pattern is:


On Sunday, northbound Sutton Loop trains change between stopping at Blackfriars and Luton. Late-night Sutton loop services (21:57 onwards) run to Bedford from Monday-Saturday and finish at Blackfriars on Sunday.

First Capital Connect and Southeastern jointly have extra peak trains from Herne Hill to Beford (morning and evening peaks), Beckenham Junction Kent House, Rochester and Swanley (evening peak only).

Herne Hill has buses by London bus which routes are 3, 37 (24 hours), 68, 196, 201, 322, 468, N3 and N68. The nearest London Underground station is Brixton.

Sparkling wine

Sparkling wine is the name for a number of wines which have a lot of carbon dioxide in them. This will make the wine fizzy. The carbon dioxide may be the result of the fermentation process, or it may have been added later. One of the best-known examples is probably Champagne, but there are many other such wines. In Spain such wines are called "Cava", in Italy "Asti" or "Spumante" and in German "Sekt". In French the terms "Mousseux" or "Crémant" are used for such wines, as well, especially for those which are not produced in the Champagne. Crémant d'Alsace, Blanquette de Limoux and Clairette de Die are examples of sparkling wines made in France outside the Champagne region. 

Most sparkling wines are made from white wine or rosé.

Crémant d'Alsace

Crémant d'Alsace is a protected designation of origin for sparkling wines made in Alsace, France. 

A big part of the wine production in Alsace is used to make Crémant d'Alsace. About 18% of the region's vineyards used for this purpose. 223 942 hectoliter of Crémant d'Alsace, about 30 million bottles, were produced in 2006.

Crémant d'Alsace has been produced in Alsace since about 1900. Julien Dopff successfully tried to make wines using the "champagne method" then.


Clairette de Die

Clairette de Die is a kind of sweet white sparkling wine made from the Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains (75% minimum) and Clairette (25% maximum) grape varieties. It is produced in the Drôme department of France, in a part of the Rhône valley near the town of Die (pronounced "Dee"). The vineyards are some of the highest in France, between 400 and 700 metres above sea level. The region has a very long history of wine-growing, going back to Roman times.

The wine is bottle fermented. The muscat grapes which ripen first are kept separate from the clairette grapes. The grape juice is kept a low temperature, about 7°C, which means the fermentation will be slow and takes time. After filtering, but leaving some yeast the juice is blended in the bottle. It must be fermented in the bottle for at least another four months. The wine is then filtered again and put into new bottles for sale.

Blanquette de Limoux

Blanquette de Limoux is the name given to a number of sparkling wines from the Languedoc, in France. 

Blanquette de Limoux is probably the oldest known sparkling wine in France. 

According to a text at a local abbey, Livy praised the wines from Limoux, which were not sparkling wines at the time.

Benedictine monks of the abbey of Saint Hilaire found out how to make sparkling wine from white wine.

Dom Pérignon brought back the method of making sparkling wines to his abbey in Champagne, at the end of the 16th century. 

He started to experiment with it in the vineyards of the abbey.

The Albert Goldfield is an area of 1300 square kilometres (500 square miles) where gold was discovered in the outback of New South Wales in 1880. Gold was found at Mount Browne, which is south west of Tibooburra. There were other finds at Good Friday, Easter Monday, Nuggerty, Pioneer Reef and Warratta Creek.

This is a very hot and dry area of Australia. Because of the shortage of water, towns were started at Milparinka and Tibooburra where there was water available. Towns at Albert and Mount Browne did not last for long because of the lack of water. By 1881 there were more than 2000 people living on the gold diggings or in the towns. Geologist William Henry John Slee was appointed resident Goldfield Warden. The miners had to either take their dirt to one of the towns to use water to pan for the gold, or use a method called dry blowing. Dry blowing means breaking the dirt into fine particles and letting the wind blow away the dirt leaving the heavier gold behind. Life on the goldfields was hard, water was scarce, fresh fruit and vegetables were not available, and basics like flour were very expensive. Disease, including dysentery and typhoid were common.

By 1893 the gold rush had ended and most people had left the goldfields.


Edward Bawden

Edward Bawden, , RA (10 March 1903 – 21 November 1989) was a British painter and an artist who drew pictures and graphics. He was also famous for his prints, book covers, posters, and metal garden furniture. During an interview, Edward Gorey said that Bawden was one of his trusted artists, making the fact interesting that not many people knew or know about this fine artist well.

Cross-City Line

The Cross-City Line is a suburban railway line in the West Midlands region of England. It runs from Redditch, Worcestershire, its southern terminus, to Lichfield, Staffordshire, its northern terminus. It goes through Birmingham New Street. It services on the line are currently operated by West Midlands Trains.

Book cover

A book cover is any protective covering used to bind together the pages of a book. The covering may be of paper, or hard paper boards, or even plastic. The boards may be covered with paper, cloth or leather. They may be laminated, with a plastic layer onto paper.

There is a distinction between hardbacks and softbacks, which are usually sold at different prices. Hardbacks may be covered with a dust jacket designed to attract readers. Softbacks are almost always designed to attract sales in bookshop displays.

The evolution of printing methods has made the production of books very much cheaper than was the case with early printed works. As a result, books are bought and read in great numbers. They compete against each other in the marketplace. The function of book design is partly to help the reader, but even more to persuade the reader to buy the book.

Lawn mower

A lawn mower (or lawnmower) is a machine that uses blades to cut a lawn. There are different types of lawn mowers. The smallest are pushed by a human, they are good for small lawns and gardens. Ride-on mowers are good for larger lawns. The largest are pulled behind a tractor, they are made for grass at places like golf courses, parks, and even fields. Always wear safety equipment while working with these machines.

A lawn mower functions by spinning either a thin blade or a small piece of cable, to cause "lacerations" on the stems of grass & other plants. Severing the plant and reducing the height of the plant to a more pleasing appearance. 

There are several types of lawn mowers available in the market. Some of the most common types are Push mowers, Self-propelled mowers, Riding mowers, Robotic mowers, Tractor mounted mowers, and Hover mowers. 

Golf course

A golf course is where the game of golf is usually played. It is made up of a series of 'holes', each consisting of certain key areas. A teeing ground is used to start playing the hole. A Fairway is the area between the tee and the green, where the grass is kept short for ball play. The green (or putting green) is a closely mowed area of grass surrounding the hole. It has a flagstick so the golfer can see the hole at longer distances. The hole itself has a diameter of 4¼ inches (108mm). Other areas of a golf course are called hazards. These include sand hazards and water hazards. Hazards are designed to make the game more challenging.

A standard round of golf consists of playing eighteen holes. Many golf courses are designed with eighteen holes. Some, however, only have nine holes, and the course is played twice per round.

Tom Eckersley

Tom Eckersley (30 September 1914, Lancashire – 4 August 1997) was an English poster artist and teacher of design.


Leaf blower

A leaf blower is a gardening tool uses air to move yard debris like leaves. Some leaf blowers can also suck leaves through a vacuum, and shred (break into small pieces) them into a bag.

Hose

A hose is a tube made to take fluids or gasses from one place to another. Hoses are also called tube or pipes. The shape of a hose is usually cylindrical.

Watering can

A watering can is a container that is used to water plants by hand.

Irrigation sprinkler

Sprinkler irrigation is a way of artificially watering plants. A sprinkler irrigation system is a pressurized system, which means it needs water under pressure to work. There are many different types of irrigation sprinklers. Some are used in home gardens, and some are used on farms.

A permanent sprinker system is made of a pump to take water and create pressure, and a network of pipes leading to the sprinkler heads. Usually the sprinkler head is on a small pipe that comes out of the ground.

Skagit River

The Skagit River is a river in Canada and the United States. It flows about from British Columbia to the state of Washington, where it flows into the Pacific Ocean north of Seattle. The river begins by flowing south. It then enters North Cascades National Park, where it is dammed by Ross Dam, which forms Ross Lake, a reservoir. 

The river then leaves the lake and flows into Diablo Lake, also a reservoir. It then keeps flowing southwest through a deep river canyon, known as the Skagit Gorge. It then meets its largest tributary, the Sauk River, and then turns west. The Sauk is about 45 miles long, flowing northwest.

After turing west, the Skagit parallels the North Cascades Highway, leaving the national park. It meets another tributary, the Baker River, from the north. The Baker flows south about 30 miles and is dammed twice, in Baker Lake and Lake Shannon. The river then flows out to the sea near Mount Vernon, Washington. The total extent of the basin is 1,505 square miles (3,900 square kilometers).

North Cascades National Park

North Cascades National Park is a national park in the U.S. state of Washington. It was established on 2 October 1968. The park covers 634,000 acres of the Cascade Range (specifically the North Cascades).
The Park is split in half by the Skagit River, which flows south then southwest through the park. Another primary watercourse of the park is the Baker River which flows into the Skagit and the Stehekin River (which flows into Lake Chelan in the southeast).

North Cascades National Park features the rugged mountain peaks of the North Cascades Range. This is the most expansive glacial system in the mainland United States. The Park also has the headwaters of numerous waterways, and vast forests with the highest degree of flora biodiversity of any US national park.
The region was first settled by Paleo-Indian Native Americans. By the time white explorers arrived it was inhabited by Skagit tribes.

Green River

The Green River is a river in the states of Wyoming and Utah, in the United States. It is the largest tributary of the Colorado River, at about 730 miles (1,175 km) long. Its headwaters are in the west part of Wyoming, in a subrange of the Rocky Mountains known as the Wind River Range. From there, it flows south, then turns east for a short while, then flows south, west, and south into the Reservoir, formed by Fontenelle Dam, and Flaming Gorge Reservoir, which is formed by the Flaming Gorge Dam. 

After it exits the dam, it flows east around the Uinta Mountains, and enters the desert-like Colorado Plateau. Here, it flows in a series of deep and spectacular canyons. It meets both of its largest tributaries, the White River and the Yampa River, from the east. In Canyonlands National Monument, it meets the Colorado. Shortly after the two rivers meet, they flow into Lake Powell, formed by Glen Canyon Dam.


Mono Lake

Mono Lake is a saline lake on the east side of the Sierra Nevada, in the U.S. state of California. It is endorheic, meaning that it does not connect with the sea. It is fed by streams flowing off the east side of the mountain range, including Rush Creek, Lee Vining Creek and Mill Creek. Lee Vining Creek has its headwaters near Tioga Pass, near Yosemite National Park. 

The lake covers 69 square miles (180 square kilometers) and is about long. It is a very ancient lake, and is thought to have formed 760,000 years ago. In the 20th century, the city of Los Angeles began to take water from the streams feeding Mono Lake. This caused the lake to fall, exposing unique tufa formations.

Thelyphonida

Thelyphonida is an order of arachnids commonly known as vinegarroons.

They give out a vinegar-like mist (containing mostly acetic acid). The Vinegarroon is not venomous and is not a true scorpion. It is related to spiders, true scorpions, and ticks. They are also known as whip scorpions because they look like true scorpions and because of their whip like tails.

Mount Shasta

Mount Shasta is a dormant volcano in northern California in the United States.

The volcano is part of the Cascade Range. It has a smaller peak abutting it, Shastina, and seven glaciers. The mountain stands alone in a large expanse of flatter land, rising 9,822 feet above the surrounding terrain. The Sacramento River flows south near the west edge of the mountain. The town of Mount Shasta and Shasta Lake Reservoir, formed by Shasta Dam, are all named for Mount Shasta. This stratovolcano is expected to erupt again someday.

Zhu Xi

Zhu Xi or Chu Hsi (, 18 October 1130 – 23 April 1200) was a Confucian scholar during the Song Dynasty. Zhu Xi was one of the three most important Confucian philosophers. He organized the classic works of Confucianism and contributed to the philosophy of Neo-Confucianism.He was from Fujian province in China. 

Zhu Xi was born Wu Yuan, North East Jiangxi province. His father died when he was at the age of thirteen. He continued his studies until he passed the test for a government job. He taught for many years in the Wuyi Mountains and he is also remembered for the time he spent teaching at the Yuelu Academy in Changsha and at his retreat near the White Deer Grotto in Lushan. In his life his ideas were not generally accepted and he was fired from quite a lot of official positions. After his death nearly 1000 people were at his funeral and his tablet was put in a Confucian temple.
During the Song Dynasty, Zhu Xi's teachings were considered to be unorthodox. Rather than focusing on the "Book of Changes" like other Neo-Confucians, he chose to emphasize the Four Books: the "Great Learning", the "Doctrine of the Mean", the "Analects of Confucius", and the "Mencius" as the core curriculum (thing to learn) for aspiring scholar officials. For all these classics he wrote extensive commentaries (big reviews) that were not widely recognized in his time; however, they later became accepted as their standard commentaries. The Four Books served as the basis of civil service examinations all the way down to 1905.

According to Zhu Xi, knowledge and action were indivisible components of truly intelligent activity. Although he did distinguish (tell apart) between the priority of knowing, since intelligent action requires forethought (thought before), and the importance of action, as it produces a discernible effect, Zhu Xi said "Knowledge and action always require each other. It is like a person who cannot walk without legs although he has eyes, and who cannot see without eyes although he has legs. With respect to order, knowledge comes first, and with respect to importance, action is more important."

Plym Valley Railway

The Plym Valley Railway is part of the closed South Devon and Tavistock Railway near Plymouth. It is a branch line of the Great Western Railway in Devon.

Swanage Railway

The Swanage Railway is a six-mile (10 km) long heritage railway in the Purbeck district of Dorset, England. The railway follows the route of the Purbeck branch line between Norden railway station, Corfe Castle railway station, Harman's Cross railway station, Herston Halt railway station and Swanage. The line was re−connected to the mainline at Wareham, Dorset along a stretch of the branch line. This had previously only remained open to freight traffic until 2005. Trains operate on the Swanage Railway between Swanage and Norden Park & Ride every weekend and Bank Holiday from mid-February to the end of the year. From April to October, they operate all seven days in the week; with Santa Special services in December. The link between the Swanage Railway and the main line at Wareham has been used used for materials deliveries, special excursions. The line has now reopened to its first through traffic from London with occasional special services.

Mangapps Railway Museum

The Mangapps Railway Museum (previously Mangapps Farm Railway Museum) is a heritage railway located near Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex. The stretch of standard gauge track and museum are owned and operated by the Jolly family. They are assisted by a dedicated staff of volunteers. It was never part of the national rail network. 

West Somerset Railway

The West Somerset Railway (WSR) is a heritage railway. It runs along the edge of the Quantock Hills in Somerset, England, between Bishops Lydeard and Watchet. The line then turns inland to Washford. It then returns to the coast for the run to Minehead. The Exmoor National Park is nearby.

Vale of Glamorgan Railway

The Vale of Glamorgan Railway Company are a Welsh railway preservation society originally called the Butetown Historic Railway Society.

In 1979, the Butetown Historic Railway Society was formed at Bute Road Station in the docklands are of Cardiff. The aim was to restore the then derelict Taff Vale Railway station, and establish a steam hauled passenger service to Cardiff Queen Street station. By 1994, a short section of track existed, and the steam locomotive "Sir Gomer" hauled short passenger trains.

By 1997, the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was in charge of the redevelopment of Butetown, and dismissed the idea of a rejuvenated steam railway as part of their plans.

Even prior to 1997 the railway started negotiations with the Vale of Glamorgan Council and moved in during 1998 to its new base at Barry Island Railway. It renamed it self the Vale of Glamorgan Railway Company and were based there till early 2009 operating heritage services both steam and diesel over an expanding network of lines.

Following the December 2007 decision by landlords, the Vale of Glamorgan Council to terminate the £65,000 funding of the Barry Island Railway, the society maintain a service. However less than six months after withdrawing financial support, the council with out warning decided to put the railway site out to tender under a long term lease. There were three bids submitted with the sucsefull bidder being the commercial company Cambrian Transport who have been the councils railway adviser and contractor since the Barry Railway Project started.

The other bidder NEWCO was submitted by Graham Lee owner of the LH Plant, Hunselt Engine Company, Statfold Barn Railway and Mike Thomson owner of Arrowvale who make black boxes for the rail industry. NEWCO had spoken to the VGR in advance and agree a method of working together. Had this bid been successfully the VGR would have continued operating at Barry.

The Railway has recently sold assets following the break down of talks with Cambrian Transport which an has been forced to leave Barry. It is now the intention for the railway to relocate to the Bridgend Valleys Railway, with some stock also going to the Dean Forest Railway and further a field.

The Railway is now working with the Bridgend Valleys Railway to develop the 4.5 miles of line in place north of Bridgend.

Northampton &amp; Lamport Railway

The Northampton & Lamport Railway is a standard gauge heritage railway in Northamptonshire, England. It is based at Pitsford and Brampton station, near the villages of Pitsford and Chapel Brampton. This is roughly north of Northampton.

Epping Ongar Railway

The Epping Ongar Railway is a preserved railway. It runs along the last section of the old Great Eastern Railway and London Underground Central line branch line. The line runs between Epping and Ongar. There is also an intermediate stop at North Weald. The line was reopened in late 2004 after 10 years of being closed. It runs a Sunday and Bank Holiday service using a Class 117 diesel multiple unit. The service runs between Ongar and Coopersale. The service is provided by volunteers who take care for the line as well as run the trains. The land and infrastructure are owned by Epping Ongar Railway Ltd.

The branch line to Ongar was built in 1865 by the Eastern Counties/Great Eastern Railway. The eastern section of the line, between Epping and Ongar, was single track. There was one passing loop at North Weald station. Around 14 trains went as far as Ongar station each day. The rest finished at Epping or Loughton.

The trains continued to finish at Epping or Loughton until 1949. At this time the London Passenger Transport Board's New Works project extended the Central line to Epping using electric trains. The Central Line would take over the railway from British Rail. As part of this change, the Epping-Ongar branch line had its through trains to London removed. Instead, a shuttle service between Epping (to connect with trains to London) and Ongar was used. At one stage, it was possible to see the unusual sight of steam trains and London Underground electric multiple units side-by-side at Epping. The steam shuttle was hired by the London Transport Executive from British Rail. This was because it was felt that the cost of electrifying the line to Ongar could not be justified because of the low passenger numbers on this part of the branch.
In the 1950s, there were attempts to improve the service on the branch line. Over time, permission was given to electrify the line in 1957. However, because the electrification did not cost much, the branch was only able to have special two- or three-car trains running on it. This was because the power supply was not strong enough to support trains that had more cars. Another problem was that the stations on the line had short platforms. This would mean that the normal 8-car trains would not be able to stop at them. Because of this, the Epping-Ongar branch line was normally operated separately from the rest of the Central Line. However, for two days each year, trains did run through from London. These trains would terminate at North Weald for the airshow on the Saturday and Sunday of its opening. The normal Epping-Ongar service would get around this extra service by passing the train on the other line at North Weald station whilst it headed towards Epping. The train from London was run as an extra train on the normal Central Line timetable. However, this extra train was only four carriages long instead of the normal eight.

During the late 1960s it became clear that the number of people using the line had not become as high as people thought that it would. Not a lot of new development was allowed because the land was now Green Belt land. The number of people using the line peaked in 1971, and it was still only 650 people every day. This meant that the line did not make very much money. London Underground tried to close the whole line in 1980, but they were not able to. Instead, fewer trains were run on the line and they also closed Blake Hall tube station on Sundays.

Blake Hall was permanently closed in 1981. Before the station closed it only had six passengers a day. The station building still survives as a private residence. However, the platform was removed, but recently (2015) partially reinstated to a very high standard.

North Weald station's platform one was closed in 1976. The passing loop and westbound tracks were lifted in 1978. Until this time, access to the two platforms was controlled from the original Eastern Counties Railway signal box. This signal box is still on the southbound platform. North Weald was the last section of the London Underground network to be signalled using semaphore signals.

The line was making a loss of seven pounds for each passenger journey. It was also in need of some expensive maintenance work. On 30 September 1994, the line was closed to the public, with one months notice. From this time on, the Central Line terminated at Epping station. When the line closed it was carrying just 80 passengers a day. Local lore said that the line was being kept open in case the Cabinet needed to be evacuated to the nuclear bunker at Kelvedon Hatch.

Cravens Heritage Trains have preserved a three-car unit of 1960 stock. This was the train that ran the final London Underground service on the line.

The line was bought by Pilot Developments in 1998. Pilot Developments is now known as Epping Ongar Railway Ltd. The Ongar Railway Preservation Society also entered an offer to buy the line. Their offer was for £339,500. However, Pilot Developments matched the offer and got London Underground to accept it. Martin Bell, an independent politician, said that this was "the most controversial land deal in the constituency for years". He said that there was a conflict of interest with local politicians.

The line reopened on Sunday 10 October 2004. It is being run by the Epping Ongar Railway Volunteer Society. An hourly service between Ongar and North Weald was operated. Shortly after opening the line was extended to Coopersale. However, it is currently not possible to get off the train there.

Between 22 January and 9 April 2006 the line was closed for engineering works. The works included general station maintenance, rolling stock maintenance and track maintenance. Ongar station remained closed for engineering works and general maintenance and reopened on Sunday 28 May 2006 to passengers. At first though it was not possible to use the station buildings.

At the end of 2007, the railway was sold to a new private owner. This was because planning permission for the Ongar residential development had been given. The new owner wants to bring steam locomotives back to the line.

In early 2008, the line was closed to passenger trains. This was to allow the railway to be able to have major engineering works. The work will mean that steam locomotives will be able to run on the line again. To make this happen run-round loops and signalling, amongst other things, must be built.

Passenger services on the heritage line were operated throughout 2006 and 2007 by a Class 117 diesel multiple unit. This unit is currently being restored along with a class 205 DEMU. Class 37029 is in operation along with 03170. There are a selection of British rail Mk1 and Mk2 coaches on the line. The line also has some small diesel shunters; a Drewry shunter (works number 2566, current number D1995), named "Heather" by the railway, and two Ruston 88 shunters (RH 512572 is in service, RH 398616 is being used for spares and as a static display). The line employs a Harsco tug unit ("Badger") for engineering work. The EOR's fleet also includes a small works trolley, a Shark brake van, a Dogfish ballast hopper, and a box van for permanent way duties. 

At one point the line owned two trains of 1962 tube stock. Units 1616 and 1491 (formed as an eight-car train) were purchased in 1996, and unit 1744 was purchased in 1998. These units were taken away to be cut up for scrap in 1998 and 2003, respectively, after they were destroyed by vandals.


Ecclesbourne Valley Railway

The Ecclesbourne Valley Railway is a heritage railway in Derbyshire. Its operations are based at Wirksworth station. It is currently planned to extend the railway along the former Midland Railway branch line which joined the main-line at Duffield. 

When complete it will be one of the few Heritage Railways that operates a whole branch line in its original form and entire length.

The line is operated by diesel locomotives, which haul former multiple unit trailer cars and also uses heritage diesel multiple units.

The "Wirksworth Branch" was the product of early nineteenth century railway rivalry. Since 1835 Wirksworth's citizens had been promoting the idea for a branch line from the North Midland Railway (later the Midland Railway) at Duffield. The Midland was initially uninterested, but then realised that the branch could be extended to Rowsley. This was difficult, but the branch could avoid the section from Ambergate, on its Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway, which was shared with its rival the London and North Western Railway.

Crossrail 2

The Chelsea-Hackney (or "Chelney") line is a safeguarded route for an underground railway running from south-west London to north-east London. As of 2008, the plan is being developed by Cross London Rail Links Ltd. who are the developers of Crossrail. It is therefore sometimes known as Crossrail 2.

River Lee

The River Lee or River Lea is a river in England. It begins in Leagrave Park, Leagrave, Luton in the Chiltern Hills. It flows generally southeast, east, and then south to London where it meets the River Thames. The last section is known as Bow Creek.
A section of the river runs through Hertford castle and shares a valley with the river Beane at Hartham common. Morgans School, in Hertford, have named one of their houses after the river Lea.

Naval mine

A naval mine is a bomb placed in water to destroy ships or submarines. Unlike depth charges, mines are put in the water and left to wait until they make contact with a ship. Naval mines can be used offensively, to make it harder for enemy ships to sail easily, or trap them into a harbour. They can also be used defensively, to protect friendly ships and create "safe" zones.

Mines can be laid in many ways: by specially built minelayers, refitted ships, submarines, aircraft, or even by dropping them into a harbour by hand. They are a cheap weapon with a basic mine costing as little as US$1000. There are very advanced mines which can cost millions and have several kinds of sensors, and deliver a warhead by rocket or torpedo.

International law says that nations have to say when they put mines in an area. This is to make it easier for civil shipping to avoid the mines. The warnings do not have to be specific; during World War II, Britain said simply that it had mined the English Channel, North Sea, and French coast.

Alan Fletcher (graphic designer)

Alan Gerard Fletcher (27 September 1931 – 21 September 2006) was a British graphic designer. He was described by "The Daily Telegraph" as "the most highly regarded graphic designer of his generation, and probably one of the most prolific".

The Edge Chronicles

The Edge Chronicles are books of young-adult and fantasy written by Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell. It contains three trilogies. All in the books is surrealist. Characters, cities, places, monuments, animals, plants, transportation and more were invented by the writers.

The books are in the chronological order of the story.










Rake

A rake is an garden and farm tool. People use rake to gather loose things like leaves, hay, and grass.

In gardening, a rake loosens soil, and removes weed and dead grass from lawns.

Scythe

A scythe (, from Old English "siðe".) is an agricultural tool for mowing grass or reaping crops. It was replaced by horse-drawn machines and then tractors, but is still used in some areas of Europe and Asia.

Elroy Finn is drummer for the psychobilly band The Tricks and has been filling in on drums for Cut Off Your Hands.

Francisco Correa de Arauxo

Francisco Correa de Arauxo (or Araujo) (b. Seville, 1584; d. Segovia, 1654) was an important Spanish organist, composer, and theorist in the last years of the Renaissance and early years of the Baroque period.

We do not know very much about Correa de Araujo. He was probably born in 1584. He may have been of Portugese origin. In 1599 he got a job as organist in Seville. It must have been an important job because he earned a lot of money. Many years later he seems to have become a priest. He may have been made a priest because he was a good organist. In 1630 he organized a protest when priests were made to work harder wothout being paid more money. Because he argued about this he was sent to prison for a time. By 1635 his health was very bad. In spite of earning a high salary he often had no money.

After 37 years in Seville he took a job as organist in Jaén Cathedral. He was there until 1640 when he went to Segovia Cathedral. He worked there until 1653, by which time he was too ill to work. When he died the following year he was very poor.

Correa only seems to have published one collection of organ works. It was called "Libro de tientos y discursos de música practica, y theorica de organo intitulado Facultad organica" (1626). This was a collection of organ music, as well as a discussion about music theory. It is one of the few books we have which shows us what musical composition was like in Spain at that time. His organ music uses a divided keyboard (medio registro), so that the upper and lower parts of the keyboard (high notes and low notes) can use different stops (making different sounds). The organ pieces in the collection are arranged in order of difficulty. The pieces at the end are very hard indeed. He uses a lot of dissonances, and he expects the performer to put in lots of ornaments, even if they are not shown in the music. He uses glosa (ornamental figuration), although he also uses counterpoint. His harmony shows the influence of composers such as Cabezon and Aguilera de Heredia.

Collaboration is when people work with each other to complete a task. It involves co-operation and teamwork and the sharing of ideas, knowledge and skills to reach the same objective. The objective is usually creative in nature. Most collaboration needs leadership or some kind of co-ordination, although responsibilities can be shared within an egalitarian group.

Each person plays a tightly or loosely defined role in the process of collaboration. For instance, to make a movie a writer, director, producer and actors are needed. There may also be a need for a costumer, a cameraman (if the director cannot do it all), an audio engineer, and a film editor if the project is big enough and the schedule tight enough.

Not only individuals collaborate; groups also do it. Large construction projects are usually done by collaborations between corporations, wars are often fought between alliances of countries, and political parties often collaborate in government.


Apollo 14

Apollo 14 was the eighth crewed mission in the Apollo program. It was the third mission to land on the Moon. The nine-day mission left the Earth on January 31, 1971, and landed on the Moon on February 5. The Lunar Module landed in the Fra Mauro formation; this had been the target of the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission. During the two walks on the Moon's surface, of moon rock was collected. Several experiments, including seismic studies, were carried out. Commander Alan Shepard famously hit two golf balls on the lunar surface with a makeshift club he had brought from Earth. Command Module Pilot Stuart Roosa took several hundred seeds on the mission, many of which were planted on return, resulting in the so-called Moon trees. The pilot of the Lunar Module was Dr. Edgar Mitchell.

In June 2009, the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter was able to photograph the Apollo 14 landing site. The base of the lunar module and the astronauts footprints on the Moon's suface could be clearly seen.

Plantain

The plantain is a crop from the genus Musa. Its fruits are edible, and are generally used for cooking. This is different from the soft and sweet banana (which is often called "dessert banana"). "Dessert bananas" are more common to import in countries in the European Union or the United States.

The way certain species are called often show how they are used: "cooking plantain", "banana plantain", "beer banana", "bocadillo plantain" (the little one), etc. All members of the genus "Musa" are indigenous to the tropical region of Southeast Asia, including the Malay Archipelago and northern Australia.

Plantains are often firmer than dessert bananas; they also have less sugar. Dessert bananas are often eaten raw; plantains are usually cooked or otherwise processed before they are eaten. Plantains are a staple food in tropical regions, treated similarly to potatoes.

Primary cultivation originated in Southeast Asia, secondary in West Africa. Other regions with plantain crops include the Southern United States, the Caribbean, Central America, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, the Canary Islands, Madeira, Egypt, Cameroon, Nigeria, Uganda, Okinawa, Kerala and Taiwan. Farmers grow plantains as far north as Northern California and as far south as KwaZulu-Natal.

Each pseudostem of a plantain plant will flower only once. All the flowers grow at the end of its shoot in a large bunch made of multiple "hands" with individual "fingers" (the fruits). Only the first few hands will become fruits. In Vietnam the young male flower, at the end of the bunch, is used to make salad. 
In Laos, the plantain flower is often eaten raw; it is added to a special kind of soup. Thoran is made in Kerala with the end of the bunch (called "Koompu" in Malayalam and Vazhaipoo in Tamil). It is said to be very healthy. You can fry it or boil it

Plantain leaves are used like plates in several dishes, including hallaca from Venezuela, or south Indian Thali. In southern India, meals are traditionally served on a plantain leaf. The position of the different food items on the leaf is important, also for Hindu rituals.

The plantain leaves often add an aroma to the dish. In the Indian state of Kerala, a food preparation called "Ada" is made in plantain leaves. Plantain leaves are also used in making "Karimeen Pollichathu" in Kerala.

The leaves are usually easy to find in Venezuela. They are sold at grocery stores, and they can be bought on the open-air markets there . Leaves can be very big, over in length. They are also used to stimulate appetite, as they have a distinctive smell when hot food is placed on them.

In Nicaragua, leaves are used to wrap different kinds of food, such as Nacatamales,Vigoron and Vaho. In Peru they are often used to wrap the famous Tamale (Tamales). In Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia, these are usually used to wrap tamales before and while cooking, and they can be used to wrap any kind of seasoned meat while cooking to keep the flavor in. The plantain is the main food source of the Dominican Republic, and is used just as much as, if not more than, rice. Mangu and Sancocho are two dishes for which the plantain is very important.

The leaves are also dried and used to wrap corn dough before it is boiled to make Fanti kenkey, a fine Ghanaian dish eaten with ground pepper, onions, tomatoes and fish.

The plantain will only fruit once. After harvesting the fruit, the plantain plant can be cut and the layers peeled (like an onion) to get a cylinder shaped soft shoot. This can be chopped and first steamed, then fried with masala powder, to make an excellent dish. This dish is called "Posola" in Assamese and a distinct part of Assamese cuisine. 

Staple food

A staple food is a food item that can be stored easily and eaten throughout the year. 

The term means the common basis of the everyday diet in a place. Potatoes and rice are the most usual examples, but bread is "not" a staple food because it is a manufactured food which cannot be stored. Of course, it can always be made, since wheat "is" a staple food. Fruit is not a staple because it usually grows at a certain time of year. Meat is not a staple because it may not be available, or is expensive to buy. Green vegetables may be a staple in some countries, but not others. Foods which need special facilities, such as refrigeration are not staple foods.

Here are some examples of staple foods:

Zhengzhou

Zhengzhou (, pinyin: zhèngzhōu) is the capital of Henan Province in the People's Republic of China. It is in the northcentral part of Henan.

Zhengzhou is on the southern bank of the Yellow River. It is one of the Eight Great Ancient Capitals of China. In 2010, 9,378,000 people lived there.

As of 2017, the prefecture-level city is divided into 6 urban districts, 5 county-level cities and 1 county. Because of rapid population growth, the subdivisions may change.

Braidwood, New South Wales

Braidwood () is a town in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. It is in the Palerang Shire. In 2006 there were 1,108 people living in Braidwood. It was used as a location for the movie Ned Kelly starring Mick Jagger in 1969.

Braidwood is on the Kings Highway which joins Canberra to Batemans Bay on the coast. It is about south west of Sydney. It is in a highland area near the headwaters of the Shoalhaven River.

Europen explorers, Kearns, Marsh and Packer, reached the area in 1822 and the settlers arrived soon after. The town was surveyed in 1839. Gold was discovered in 1851, and over the next 20 years the population grew to about 10,000.

The town was named after Dr Thomas Braidwood Wilson. He had been a surgeon on the ships taking convicts to New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land (now known as Tasmania). He was first given land in Van Diemen's Land in 1824, but changed it for land near Lake George in 1825. He was also given of land in the 'new country' on Monkittee and Flood creeks. In 1833 the government took back the western end of Wilson's land for a future village. They gave him more land at the eastern land in return. Wilson moved to the district in late 1836 with his wife and family. He became a community leader. He built the first courthouse in 1837-38. In 1840 Wilson asked the government to build a road from Braidwood to Huskisson for faster and cheaper shipping of wool to Sydney. Wilson and Col. John Mackenzie, supplied the materials and men to make the Braidwood to Nerriga section. In 1841 there were 141 people living at Braidwood Farm. Wilson lost all of his money because of a drought in the late 1830s. He died in November 1843. His land was sold for £2,000 to John Coghill, who now owned most of the land on the south, east and north of the town. Wilson still owned land on a hill north of the town and was buried there in 1843.

A memorial and large pine tree mark the site of Wilson's grave. The path to the grave is open to the public and is through a series of paddocks with gateway sculptures and large art pieces by local artists.

Bushrangers, Thomas and John Clarke, killed four policemen near Braidwood in 1867. There is a special monument for the police in the Braidwood cemetery.

Australia's first Royal Commission took place in Braidwood in 1867. It looked at the role of the police in trying to control bushrangers in the area. The Commission found the police were lazy, and in some cases had actually helped the bushrangers. They found that the superintendent of police did not have 'strict and proper control over his men.'

Because of the goldrush the banks and hotels in Braidwood were well built and made to last. It is these old heritage buildings that now attract visitors to the town. Other businesses in the area are sheep and cattle farming, and timber growing.

Braidwood used to be the home of the Tallaganda local government area. However, following changes to local government areas by the New South Wales Government, it is now part of the Palerang council. The eastern office of the council is in the town. The local paper is now called the "Braidwood Times".

After the gold rush, Braidwood became a quiet and poor country town. Because of this, very little new building work was carried out, and so the town still has most of its original streetscape and architecture intact. On 30 March 2006 the town and its setting were listed on the NSW State Heritage Register. There were arguments between those who wanted to save the town's old fashioned charm and those wishing to develop it.

The town has several times been used for movie making locations:

Local stories say that Mick Jagger wrote one of his major hits while in Braidwood making the "Ned Kelly" film; but there is no agreement as to which one.

Ned Kelly is the name of a 1970 movie. It was the second Australian feature length movie about Australian bushranger Ned Kelly. The first was "The Story of the Kelly Gang" made in 1906, the world's first feature movie.

"Ned Kelly" was directed by Tony Richardson, and starred Mick Jagger as Ned Kelly. Scottish-born actor Mark McManus played the part of Kelly's friend Joe Byrne. It was a British production, but was filmed entirely in Australia, shot mostly around Braidwood in southern New South Wales, with mainly Australian actors.

There were many problems in getting the movie made. The actors' union, Actors' Equity and some of Ned Kelly's relatives protested strongly about Jagger having the lead role. Many people were upset that the movie would be made in New South Wales, not Victoria, where the Kellys had lived.

Jagger's girlfriend, Marianne Faithfull, had come to Australia to play the lead female role of Ned's sister, Maggie. Their relationship was breaking up, and she took an overdose of sleeping tablets soon after she got to Sydney. She was in a coma, but soon got better and went back to England. She was replaced by an unknown Australian actress, Diane Craig. During filming, Jagger was hurt by a pistol misfiring. The actors and crew were often sick, some costumes were destroyed by fire, and Jagger's co-star, Mark McManus, just escaped serious injury when a horse-drawn cart in which he was riding overturned during filming.

The body armour costume worn by Jagger is on show at the Queanbeyan City Library, with the letters "MJ" scratched on the inside. The head-piece has been stolen, the loss of an important piece of Australian movie history.

The movie was very poorly received at its opening, and is still said to be Richardson's worst movie. Neither Richardson or Jagger went to the London opening of the movie.

The movie has music written by Shel Silverstein, and performed by Kris Kristofferson and Waylon Jennings, with one song by Jagger.


Spring Offensive

The 1918 Spring Offensive or Kaiserschlacht ("Kaiser's Battle"), also known as the Ludendorff Offensive, was a series of German attacks along the Western Front during World War I, which marked the deepest advances by either side since 1914. The German authorities had realised that their only remaining chance of victory was to defeat the Allies before the overwhelming human and matériel resources of the United States could be deployed. They also had the advantage of nearly 50 divisions freed by the Russian surrender (Treaty of Brest-Litovsk). 

The first and most important part was called Operation Michael. It used new infiltration tactics. After the offensive, not enough German soldiers were still alive to win the war anymore.

Tang Enbo

Tang Enbo (1898-1959) was a Nationalist general in the Republic of China. Along with Hu Zongnan and Xue Yue, Tang was one of the Kuomintang generals most respected by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War. 


Xue Yue

Xue Yue (1896-1998) was a Nationalist general in the Republic of China. Xue joined the Chinese army in 1914, at the age of 18. Along with Hu Zongnan and Tang Enbo, Xue was one of the Kuomintang generals most respected by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Xue was in the defense of greater Wuhan, commanding the 1st Army Corps. In the mountains Xue's army succeeded in nearly destroying the 106th division of the Japanese army. During the battle, most of the Japanese officers were killed and the Japanese had to drop 300 officers by parachute into the battlefield. 

Xue lived to 101 years old.

Shunroku Hata

, was a Japanese general. 

Hata was minister of war in 1939. He was commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) in China in 1941. 

He was the last surviving Japanese military officer with a rank of Field Marshal. He was jailed at the end of World War Two and released in 1955.


Bai Chongxi

Bai Chongxi (18 March 1893 – 1 December 1966), also spelled Pai Chung-hsi, was a Chinese Muslim general in the National Revolutionary Army of the Republic of China. He was a warlord in the Guangxi Province, commanding his own troops and governing Guangxi (though part of the Republic of China). He was often an ally of Chiang Kai-Shek in the politics of the Republic of China. 

Bai Chongxi Born Omar Chongxi Bai was born in Guilin, Guangxi Province.

Letter of Jeremiah

The Letter of Jeremiah, also known as the Epistle of Jeremy is a deuterocanonical (or apocryphal) book of the Old Testament. The letter is believed to have been made by Jeremiah to the people who were to be taken prisoner into Babylon. It is included in Catholic Bibles as the last part of the Book of Baruch. It is also in Orthodox Bibles as a standalone book.

Most learned people argue that the person who started the book was not Jeremiah. Jeremiah was a Hellenistic Jew who lived in Alexandria. Whoever wrote it, the work was written with a purpose: to teach the Jews not to worship the gods of the Babylonians. Instead, to worship only the Lord.
The letter (epistle) is part of the Septuagint. 

The earliest evidence we have of the question of its canonicity arising in Christian tradition is in the work of Origen of Alexandria, as reported by Eusebius in his Church History. Origen listed Lamentations and the Letter of Jeremiah as one unit with the Book of Jeremiah proper, among "the canonical books as the Hebrews have handed them down". 

Jerome provided the majority of the translation work for the vulgar (popular) Latin translation of the Bible, called the Vulgate Bible. In view of the fact that no Hebrew text was available, Jerome refused to consider the Epistle of Jeremiah, like the other books he called apocryphal, canonical.

Despite Jerome's reservations, it is included as chapter 6 of the book of Baruch in the Old Testament of the Vulgate. The Authorized King James Version does the same, while placing Baruch in the Apocrypha section. In the Ethiopian Orthodox canon, it forms part of the "Rest of Jeremiah", along with 4 Baruch (also known as the "Paraleipomena of Jeremiah").

The epistle is one of three deuterocanonical books found among the Dead Sea scrolls (the other two are Ben Sira and Tobit.) The portion of the epistle discovered at Qumran was written in Greek. This does not mean that it might not be based on an earlier Hebrew or Aramaic text. The only text we have has dozens of linguistic features available in Greek, but not in Hebrew.

Revelation

A Revelation is a source of information that is given to some people and meant to share with others from a government, influential people or a supernatural deity. In monotheistic literature, a revelation is given by God to a prophet or someone God wants to make a prophet and it is supposed to be told to others. In this page, I will explain John’s Revelation from God that is also the last book in the Bible also coincdidently called Revelation.

In Catholicism and other Christian denominations, John is also called Saint John and was Jesus Christ’s 3rd/4th called disciple. John wrote a Gospel called The Gospel according to John. He also wrote 1st, 2nd and 3rd John. The most famous verse in the Bible was written by him in John 3:16 during Christ’s conversation with the pharisee Nicodemus. John wrote the Book of Revelation and I will explain it now.

In the beginning of Revelation, it is important to know that John was currently in exile in the island of Patmos, an island in the Aegean Sea and part of Greece’s territory now, because he refused to look at Emperor Domitian as Lord and God. John explains this and he also says he saw the Heavens, so we can suggest that he was writing what he saw while having his revelation or vision —whichever you choose to call it. 

I’m not going to explain every little detail, just an overview. Jesus tells him to send a message to 7 churches in Asia Minor, that is Turkey. These are Ephesus, Symrna, Pergammum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea. He explains He knows the suffering and He is watching over them.

A few chapters in and we see Apocalyptic literature. This was very common in the writing of Jews and Christians during the great persecution of Early Christians in the Roman Empire before Emperor Constantine made Christianity the state religion. You see a lot of beasts and creatures and then the greatly feared Antichrist.

I think now I should explain the 2 witnesses and the Antichrist. The 2 witnesses will be 2 prophets who God will raise from the dead and they will preach for three and a half years when the Antichrist will come and kill them both. Then because they have been slaughtered people from all around the world will drink and exchange gifts out of merriness and joyfulness because those 2 witnesses have died and nobody can shine the light of their sins. For three and a half days, they will not be allowed to be given their final dignity and put into graves. Then after 3 and a half days, God will raise them up from the dead and everyone will be shocked (imaginable) also will be ascending into Heaven.

The Antichrist is prominent in Revelation and is spoken a lot about. Christian and Jewish elders believe it will be an influential government that will trick everyone. But for everyone else its probably this tall, well-built "man" who will slaughter the Jews just when he has gained their trust.

That’s all I have now and I will come back soon with Revelation PART 2 soon. Have a great day! and I hoped you enjoyed reading this

Sebastián Aguilera de Heredia

Sebastian Aguilera de Heredia (1561-1627) was a Spanish organist and composer.

Aguilera was born in Zaragoza, Spain on about August 15, 1561.

We do not know much about his early life. He was ordained as a priest in January 1584. In 1585 he became organist at Huesca Cathedral, where he supervised the building of a new organ at the cathedral during 1588. In 1603 he became a priest and organist at the Cathedral of La Seo, Zaragossa. He looked after the organ at the cathedral and often had work done to improve it. He remained at the cathedral until his death on December 16, 1627.

All his compositions were for the church: both his organ music and vocal music. His organ works show that he learned from composers such as Antonio de Cabezón, but he put new, modern ideas in his music which later influenced younger composers such as Correa de Arauxo. His students became the cathedral organists after his death, and were part of a tradition and style of paying which lasted for over 100 years.

A very important new technique which he used was the use of a divided keyboard (medio registro) which allowed different sounds in the upper half and the lower half of the keyboard (on today's organs one would need a two-manual organ to get the same effect). He wrote 36 settings of the Magnificat, called "Canticum Beatissimae Virginis Deiparae Mariae" (1618). His vocal work shows a skilful use of polyphony.


Shahnameh

The Shahnameh or Shāhnāma ("Book of Kings", ) is a large poetic opus by the Persian poet Ferdowsi. The book was written between 977 to 1010 AD. The "Shahnameh" is about the mythical and historical past of Persia/Iran. It is the national epic of Persia/Iran and one of the greatest literary works of the Persian language.

"Shahnameh" has been composed of 3 main parts: 1. mythical, 2. heroic, 3. historical.

Papal conclave

A Papal conclave is a meeting of cardinals. The cardinals meet to elect the next bishop of Rome, to become pope. This becomes necessary when the old pope dies or resigns. Usually, popes do not resign, though. 

The last conclave was when Pope Benedict XVI resigned in 2013 and Pope Francis was elected to replace him.

The word "conclave" is from Latin. It refers to the fact that the cardinals are locked up together, until they have agreed on a new pope. Today, this happens in the Sistine Chapel. 

Originally, the conclave was started in Italian city states, in the 12th century. These cities needed to elect officeholders, and the election needed to be free of party politics. Events such as the Investiture Controversy in medieval Europe led to people wanting "free" elections, with a medieval understanding of free. Methods were often combined, the elements used were Acclamation, naming of candidates by predecessors, or by uninvolved people, and using "electors" who would agree on the successor, behind closed doors. Earliest examples are that of Genua, in 1157, Pisa, in 1162-64, or Pistoia. 

Pope Nicholas II published a papal bull called In Nomine Domini, in 1059, which introduced the conclave as the way to elect his successor. 

Seminary

A seminary, theological college or divinity school is a university that specializes in theology or philosophy. Very often the students live at the seminary. Usually, priests have to study at a seminary at the start of their career.

Hunger

Hunger is the feeling of wanting to eat. Ghrelin is a hormone that makes people feel hungry. The opposite of hunger is called "satiety" or "fullness". Leptin causes this feeling. People can survive weeks without eating, but they will start to feel hungry after they have not eaten for a few hours. Hunger is generally considered quite uncomfortable. People who have eaten food usually will feel less hungry, or not hungry at all. People can live longer without food than without water.

Hunger is also used to refer to people who generally have little to eat, and are therefore often hungry. This can lead to starvation.


Chanakya

Chanakya (IAST: ""; c. 350-283 BCE) was an adviser and a prime minister to Chandragupta Maurya (c. 340-293 BCE). He was born in Taxila, Gandhara in modern-day Pakistan. Chanakya helped Chandragupta create the Maurya Empire.

Shloka 1- नात्यन्तं सरलैर्भाव्यं गत्वा पश्य वनस्थलीम् ।छिद्यन्ते सरलास्तत्र कुब्जास्तिष्ठन्ति पादपाः ॥

English- Do not be very upright in your dealings, as you would see in forest, the straight trees are cut down while the crooked ones are left standing.

Shloka 2- कः कालः कानि मित्राणि को देशः कौ व्ययागमौ ।कश्चाहं का च मे शक्तिरिति चिन्त्यं मुहुर्मुहुः ॥
English- Consider again and again the following: the right time, the right friends, the right place, the right means of income, the right ways of spending, and from whom you derive your power.

Shloka 3- यो ध्रुवाणि परित्यज्य अध्रुवं परिषेवते ।ध्रुवाणि तस्य नश्यन्ति चाध्रुवं नष्टमेव हि ॥ ०१-१३
English- He who gives up what is imperishable for that which is perishable, loses that which is imperishable; and doubtlessly loses that which is perishable also.

Shloka 4- गुणैरुत्तमतां याति नोच्चैरासनसंस्थितः। प्रासादशिखरस्थोऽपि काकः किं गरुडायते॥ १६-०६

English- Greatness comes from good qualities and not from a high position. A crow doesn’t become a Garuda (the chief of the feathered race) just by sitting on the top of a palace.

Shloka 5- अतिरुपेनावे सिता: अतिगर्वेना उर्वशि अतिदानथा कर्ण पुरुश-श्रेष्ठ निष्पाप सरसवति नारद याति बखान| स्वर्गारोहन परिषेवते सम्राट| अत:पुरुषोत्तम रघुराम, अनाघ याति अयोध्या मे रामराज्य|

English- There can be no beautiful and compassionate woman like Sita. There can be no beautiful but proudy woman like Urvashi. There can be no man like Karna, the supremest of all men(पुरुश-श्रेष्ठ).

His glories and heroism has been narrated by Narada and Saraswati and eventually he attains the highest goal of a human and unites with his brothers in heaven and becomes the king of the Swarga. There can be no great men like Rama, the purushottam himself. He is sinless and eventually he also becomes the king of Ayodhya and brings Ram-Rajya on earth.

Shloka 6- नोच्चैरासनसंस्थितः ज्ञान अत:अहंकार बाली, अत: ज्ञान कृष्ण काकः लंकेश, समाज करे बखान|

English- Knowledge is the most powerful tool in this world. Gyaanis are always respected in this world no matter what. Despite their clans were destroyed, Bali, Krishna and Ravana still have their names in this world because of their 'Gyaan'.

He is generally called Chanakya (taken from his father's name "Chanak") but, in his capacity as author of the "Arthaśhāstra", is generally referred to as Kautilya derived from his gotra's name "KOTIL"(Kautilya means "of Kotil"). He believed in four ways: Treating with Equality, Enticement, Punishment or War and Sowing disagreement. The "Arthaśhāstra" identifies its author by the name Kautilya, except for one verse which refers to him by the name Vishnugupta. One of the earliest Sanskrit literatures to explicitly identify Chanakya with Vishnugupta was Vishnu Sarma's "Panchatantra" in the 3rd century BC.



Trowel

A trowel is a small tool used for digging, smoothing, or moving around small amounts of material.


Juniper

Junipers is the name for a number of species of coniferous plants in the genus "Juniperus". They are related to the family "Cupressaceae" (the cypress). There are between 50 and 67 species of juniper. Junipers grow in the northern hemisphere. 

Junipers are evergreen. They vary in size from low shrubs to tall trees, which grow to between twenty and forty metres tall. 

The female trees have seed cones. These look like like a berry, and are called juniper berries. They take from six to eighteen months to grow after pollination. They are often aromatic, and can be used as a spice.

Unfortunately, the berries of some species, such as "Juniperus sabina", are toxic. Eating them them is not advised. "Juniper" has a number of species, and you have to know what you are doing before you eat the berries.

Juniper berry

The juniper berry is the female seed cone made by the different kinds of junipers. It is not a true berry, but its unusual roundness and merged scales make it look like a berry. Some of the cones are used as spices. Juniper berries are also used to flavour gin. According to a FAO document, juniper berries are the only spice that comes from conifers. However, tar and bark from pine trees are sometimes thought of as spices, too.
These strange and useful berries have a sour but stainable taste that isn’t suggested but if you desire you may eat one. They have also been called the clean bum fruit through history dating back to 17,000 b.c.

Henry Kissinger

Henry Alfred Wolfgang Kissinger (born Heinz Alfred Wolfgang Kissinger; May 27, 1923 – November 29, 2023), , was a German-American political scientist, diplomat, and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. He served as both National Security Advisor and later as Secretary of State in the Nixon Administration and the Ford Administration.

Kissinger was born in Germany in 1923. As a German Jew, it was not safe for him to stay in Germany after Adolf Hitler came to power, and he left for the United States in 1933. He fought for the US against the Nazis in World War II.

Kissinger was Richard Nixon's most trusted advisor on foreign affairs. He was in government during the Cold War and promoted what he called "realpolitik" in dealing with the Soviet Union and Communist China. He was a major force behind the 1973 ceasefire in the Vietnam War.
Under Kissinger, the US opened up relations to China, which is considered one of his biggest successes. He also supported détente, an easing of the rivalry with the Soviets.

Kissinger and Lê Đức Thọ were jointly offered the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize for their work on the Paris Peace Accords which lead to the withdrawal of American forces from the Vietnam War. Lê Đức Thọ declined to accept the award saying that peace had not actually been achieved in Vietnam. Kissinger donated his prize money to charity, did not attend the award ceremony and later offered to return his prize medal after the fall of South Vietnam to North Vietnamese forces 18 months later.

In his later years, Kissinger — along with William Perry, Sam Nunn, and George Shultz — called upon governments to reduce nuclear weapons, and in three "Wall Street Journal" articles proposed a program of urgent steps to that end. The four have created the Nuclear Security Project to advance this cause.

Kissinger died at the age of 100 on November 29, 2023, at his home in Kent, Connecticut. The cause of death was congestive heart failure.

His legacy is often debated by historians. Some people criticize him, even calling him a criminal, for his tactics during the Cold War, notably supporting a military junta in Chile and backing Pakistan during the Bangladesh War. Many people, however, consider Kissinger a great figure in modern American history who ended the Vietnam War, opened up China, and supported peace in the Cold War.

At Reds, he battles with Norihiro Yamagishi for the position. From 2005, he completely played as first goalkeeper except for 2006 for injury. The club won the champions 2006 J1 League, 2003 J.League Cup, 2005 and 2006 Emperor's Cup.

Boeremusiek

Boeremusiek is from Europe. It was brought to South Africa and changed into its own style. It is thought to have got to South Africa by British Empire military bands.

Every artist or band comes up with their own sound and style. They make up their own style by playing different types of concertinas and using different instruments in the band. 

A concertina is similar to an accordion and is the lead instrument in most Boeremusiek bands. There are many different types of concertinas, which is why Boeremusiek has so many sounds and styles, and the construction the concertina is what makes the different sounds in the Boeremusiek band; it depends on where the slots and holes are put makes the difference on the sound that the concertina makes. 

Other instruments that might be in a Boeremusiek band are piano accordions, button harmonicas, accordions, pianos, harmoniums and the guitar. Sometimes, a cello or bass guitar may be seen. 

Today, there are many successful Boeremusiek bands that have recorded albums. Some famous bands and individual artists today are Klipwerf Boereorkes, Danie Grey, Nico Carstens, Taffie Kikkilus, Brian Nieuwoudt, Samuel Petzer, Worsie Visser and Die Ghitaar Man.

Military Merit Cross (Austria-Hungary)

The Military Merit Cross (German: "Militärverdienstkreuz", Croatian: "Vojni križ za zasluge") was a decoration of the Empire of Austria and, after the establishment of the Dual Monarchy in 1867, the Empire of Austria-Hungary. It was first established on 22 October 1849 and underwent several revisions to its design and award criteria over the years of its existence. It became obsolete in 1918 with the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

Microsoft Bing

Microsoft Bing (or Bing) is a search engine. It used to be called "Windows Live Search" and "MSN Search". Microsoft calls it a "decision engine", meaning that Bing tries to interpret search queries and give people better search results compared to a typical search engine, helping the user make better decisions. Bing concentrates on four major areas: shopping, travel, local and health. A preview version was made available for everyone to use on June 1, 2009, and the website was fully launched on June 3, 2009. The website quickly became popular after a few weeks.

On July 29, 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced that Bing would power Yahoo! Search. All Yahoo! Search global customers and partners will be shifted to Bing by early 2012.

In October 2011, Microsoft announced "Tiger", a new internal search computer program for Bing. When it was finished, Bing delivered faster and more relevant search results for users. It has been incorporated into Bing since August 2011.

On February 7, 2023, Microsoft launched a preview version of its Bing search engine, which is powered by OpenAI's artificial intelligence model. The new version of Bing is called "the new Bing" and is customized for search. It includes a chatbot called Microsoft Copilot.

Bing includes the listing of search suggestions as queries are entered. It lists related searches (called "Explore pane") based on semantic technology from Powerset that Microsoft purchased in 2008.

Every day, Bing.com displays a different picture that users can click on parts of to learn more about. These pictures can be about different places around the world, or nature, or even sometimes things in outer space.



Boy Scouts of America

The Boy Scouts of America or BSA is an organization for children and teens with over 5 million members across the United States. They try to give young people life values. BSA includes Cub Scouts, which is for children ages 6–11, Scouts BSA, which is for youth ages 11–17, and Venturing, Sea Scouts, and Exploring for youth ages 14–20. Scouts BSA was called Boy Scouts until it started allowing girls in 2018.

Scouts BSA are ages 11–17 and belong to troops, groups of Scouts associated with a church, school or post. Cub Scouts are scouts ages 6–11 and belong to packs. Cub Scouts include Tigers (age 6-7), Wolfs (age 7-8), Bears (age 8-9), and Webelos (age 9-11). Older Scouts can be Venturer Scouts.

The Boy Scouts of America were founded by American writer W. D. Boyce, in 1910, but were similar to Scouting groups in Great Britain and other early scout movements. James E. West helped out the BSA in its early years, but also made the BSA more religious than scouts were in Europe. Scouting grew in the 1910s and 20s due to the rise of “boy’s books” devoted to Scouting and the First World War. Scouting had many members during the 1960s, but has declined since the 1970s, despite an attempt to make scouting modern by changing requirements and adding more merit badges.

Over the years, the BSA has taken some stands that many Americans did not like. These included being against unions (organized workers) in the 1920s, requiring Scouts to believe in God, and not allowing gays to join Scouting.

An important part of scouting is earning ranks. There are seven ranks in Scouts BSA: Scout, Tenderfoot, 2nd Class, 1st Class, Star, Life and Eagle. The first four focus on learning basic scout skills, including camping, cooking, swimming, first aid (basic medical care), citizenship, orienteering (use of a map and compass), and pioneering (tying knots). The final three focus on earning merit badges, serving the troop and serving the community. Eagle Scouts must plan and finish a project that benefits something other than Scouting, and earn 21 merit badges. They must also hold a position of leadership in the troop. Only about 2 or 3% of Scouts earn Eagle, but some of the ones that have include Gerald Ford and Neil Armstrong.

Scouts must learn, know and follow the Scout Oath and Scout Law:

Counterfeit

Counterfeit is the sale or manufacture of items that have not been made by real companies or have been made illegally. Nearly anything can be counterfeit, but most counterfeiting is of clothing and other small items such as bags, medicines, money, watches, or jewellery. Most things can be sold without people realizing that they are counterfeit and that they could possibly be breaking the law by buying the counterfeit goods.

Money can also be counterfeited. Sometimes people make fake cash, and this is considered to be counterfeit. The United States Secret Service investigates people who do this.

Paktia is made up of 14 district (District Centers are given in parentheses):

Sun Microsystems

Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Sun for short) was an American company that sold computers, computer components, software, and information technology services. Sun contributed to many important computing technologies, such as Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing. Sun created the Java programming language, the Solaris operating system, the Network File System (NFS), and the SPARC instruction set. Sun was founded on February 24, 1982. Sun's headquarters were in Santa Clara, California. In January 2010, it was bought by Oracle Corporation.

Water strider

The water strider (also known as the pond skater) is a true bug, an insect of the family Gerridae. It can run across the surface of water. It lives on ponds and slow-running streams. It rarely goes underwater. The underside of the body is covered with water-repellent hair. There are around 500 known species, commonly placed in around 60 genera. Also called the Jesus bug (walks on water).

Bowler

A bowler is a person who bowls or delivers a ball to the batsman in the game of cricket. Unlike the pitcher in a game of baseball, a bowler delivers with a straight arm (see photo). A ball bowled with the elbow bent is a throw, and that is illegal. If the bowler bowls while not in the right part of the nonstriker's ground, or bowls the ball out of the reach of the striking batter, that is also illegal. Illegal bowling gives the batting team 1 point, mostly can't get players out, and doesn't count toward the limit on the number of deliveries in the game. 

A bowler who can also bat well, is called an all rounder. There are different types of bowler, and a cricket team will usually have a mix of different types.

A fast bowler uses simple speed to defeat a batsman. They can send the ball to the batsman at a speed of 145 km/h. They take a long run up before bowling each ball to build speed. Shoaib Akhtar of Pakistan was the first to bowl at a speed of 160 km/h. Another famous fast bowler is Australian Brett Lee.

A medium pace bowler bowls more slowly. They often use other tricks to defeat the batsman. They can get the ball able to curve in the air or change the speed or length (where the ball hits the ground) to fool the batsman. Some are very accurate so they can repeatedly send the ball to a place which forces the batsman to defend rather than scoring runs. Others grip the ball so that it lands on its seam; this makes the path of the ball unpredictable.

A spin bowler usually bowls quite slowly and puts a lot of spin on the ball which makes it bounce at an angle off the ground. This makes the batsman play each ball carefully. Generally spin bowlers give up the most runs but they all have "tricks" that they use to fool the batsman and get him or her out. These tricks are given names such as the arm ball, googly, flipper, topspinner or doosra. Spin bowling is very much about fooling the batsman rather than speed. A fast off spin is the normal off spin action but with more pace. Off spin is when the cricket ball spins towards a right-handed batsmen's bat (bowler's left to right). With more pace, there usually is less turn (amount of spin). Off-spin is also called an off-break or finger spin. A famous spin bowler was the Australian Shane Warne, but his type was the leg break, which uses the wrist to spin the ball from the bowler's right to left. This is varied with the top spin, when the ball comes on straight and low.

Wicket

In cricket, a wicket is:


There is one wicket in each of the two batsmen's grounds. The fielding team can hit a wicket with the ball to run out a batsman, but only if there is no batsman in the ground of the wicket. In addition, when delivering the ball to the batsman, the bowler can hit the wicket in the striker's ground with the ball to bowl the striker out.

The wicket is said to have been "put down" when any of its 5 sticks fall to the ground because it was hit by the ball or a player holding the ball. The sticks can be put back in place and then hit back off to put the wicket down more than once.

The field can be defined as having two halves: the "off side" and the "leg side"/"on side", with these being separated by an imaginary line connecting the middle stump of both wickets. The off side of the field is the right side of a field for a right-handed batsman who is looking at the bowler, and the leg side is the left side. (This is reversed for a left-handed batsman.)

A batsman is said to have "lost his wicket" when he gets out.

Dynamic and formal equivalence

Dynamic and formal equivalence are concepts from linguistics. 

When a language is translated into another one, there is a problem: the meaning of a word or a phrase in the first language is not the same as that of the word or phrase in the second language. The first language may also have words, phrases or grammatical structures that do not exist in the second language.

There are two possible ways to solve this problem:

The Undertones

The Undertones are a punk rock/power pop band from Northern Ireland. They formed in Derry in 1975. 

Luftfahrtgesellschaft Walter

The Luftfahrtgesellschaft Walter or LGW is a German airline. 


3G

3G, the short form for the third generation, is the third generation of wireless mobile telecommunication technology. It was replaced by 4G.
3G was launched on March 3rd 2003 and was replaced in 2009

Kin selection

Kin selection or kin altruism is a form of natural selection. Some animals cooperate with relatives, even if this brings risk to themselves. The classic example of this is seen in the family life of mammals, or in colonial insects such as ants. 

Many mammals and birds raise alarms to warn others of danger. Others cooperate in tasks, such as scrub jays help each other with to build nests. In all these cases where animals cooperate, the question is whether there is any biological benefit to themselves. It is now clear that there is benefit if the animals are closely related. This is because related organisms have (to a degree) a shared genetic inheritance.

The first to write about the concept were by R.A. Fisher in 1930, and J.B.S. Haldane in 1955, but it was W.D. Hamilton who truly formalized the concept. The actual term "kin selection" was probably coined by John Maynard Smith, when he wrote: 

By cooperating, relatives influence each other's fitness. Under natural selection, a gene which improves the fitness of individuals will increase in frequency. A gene which lowers the fitness of individuals will become rare. 

However, behaviour which enhances the fitness of relatives but lowers that of the actor, may nonetheless increase in frequency. Relatives do, by definition, carry many of the same genes. This is the fundamental principle behind the theory of kin selection. According to the theory, the enhanced fitness of relatives may more than compensate for the fitness loss of the helpers (individuals displaying the behaviour). 

This is a special case of a more general model, called inclusive fitness.

Hamilton's equation describes whether or not a gene for helping behaviour will spread in a population. The gene will spread if rxb is greater than c:

Foraging

Foraging is the act of hunting or gathering food. For example, cattle forage grass to eat. The idea of animals foraging is called "forage theory", and was first proposed in 1966.

Humans that forage are often called hunter-gatherers, who find and eat (wild) animals and plants without domestication of them (people who farm plants are not hunter-gatherers, as they have grown them themselves). 

Pacific Northwest

The Pacific Northwest, also referred to as Cascadia, is a region on the west coast of North America. It refers to the northwestern corner of the United States and the southwestern part of Canada. The U.S. states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and western Montana are in the southern part of the Pacific Northwest. The Canadian province of British Columbia and the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Alaska is in the northern part. The entire region is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west.

Historically, the Pacific Northwest had been inhabited by Native Americans. Starting from about 15,000 years ago, Native Americans settled along the coastline and along the major rivers. From the 1500s to the 1700s, Europeans explored the region, beginning with the discovery of Oregon and Washington. In the early 1800s, the famous Lewis and Clark expedition arrived in Washington State. From the 19th century to present day, the region began to become settled. Today, the largest cities in the Northwest include Vancouver, Seattle and Portland.

The rugged mountains of the Northwest consist of the Coast Range, which is nearer the coast, and the Cascade Range. In northern Washington, the Cascade Range is called the North Cascades. In British Columbia, it is called the Canadian Cascades. The many rivers of the Northwest result from its wet climate - the mountains trap wet Pacific air, leaving little rain for inland states like Idaho. The rivers once supported large salmon runs, but large power dams have been built on many rivers.

The main language of the Pacific Northwest is English in the United States and Canada, among the Native Americans Chinook Jargon is common. Among the many Asian immigrants, Chinese is being used more in the Northwest.

The Pacific Northwest extends from southeastern Alaska to Northern California. Along this entire length, is a large mountain range, the Cascade Range, that forms the geographic spine of the Pacific Northwest. The highest mountain in the Northwest is Mount Rainier. Rainier is high. Other notable mountains include Mount Shasta, at , and Mount Baker, at . East of the Cascades, there is the Columbia Plateau, a high area of land that stretches east to the Rocky Mountains in Idaho and Montana. In the west, the Coast Range borders the coast more closely. The Olympic Mountains are on the Olympic Peninsula, an extension of Washington State. Puget Sound is a large system of bays and straits in northwestern Washington and southeastern British Columbia.

The main rivers of the Pacific Northwest are the Fraser River, the Columbia River, and the Snake River. The Fraser River is mainly in British Columbia; it flows west to the Pacific Ocean near Vancouver. The Fraser drains most of the southern Canadian Cascades. The Columbia River begins in the Canadian Cascades and flows south, then turns west where it meets the Snake River. From there, it flows on to the ocean near Portland. The Snake River is mainly in inland Idaho. After a journey west from the Rocky Mountains, it meets the Columbia at Kennewick, Washington.

Other rivers in the Northwest include the Finlay, the Skagit, the Umpqua, the Rogue, and the Klamath. The Finlay drains the northern Canadian Cascades and flows on to join the Mackenzie River, which flows through Canada to Hudson Bay. The Skagit also begins in the Canadian Cascades, and crosses into Washington; it turns west and flows into the sea north of Everett, Washington. The Umpqua River begins in the Southern Oregon Cascades, and flows west to the Pacific Ocean near Reedsport, Oregon. The Rogue parallels the Umpqua and dumps into the sea at Gold Beach, Oregon. The Klamath flows south from a valley in inland Oregon, then turns west through northern California, cutting through the Cascade Range to its mouth near Klamath, California.


Adaptation

Adaptation is the evolutionary process where an organism becomes better suited to its habitat. This process takes place over many generations. It is one of the basic phenomena of biology.

When people speak about adaptation, they often mean a 'feature' (a trait) which helps an animal or plant survive. An example is the adaptation of horses' teeth to grinding grass. Grass is their usual food; it wears the teeth down, but horses' teeth continue to grow during life. Horses also have adapted to run fast, which helps them to escape their predators, such as lions. These features are the "product" of the process of adaptation.

The illustration of bird beaks shows an obvious sign of their different ways of life. However, eating a different food also means having a different digestive system, gut, claws, wings and above all, different inherited behaviour. For the major adaptations, what changes is not a single trait, but a whole group of features.

Adaptation occurs because the better adapted animals are the most likely to survive, and to reproduce successfully. This process is known as natural selection; it is the basic cause of evolutionary change. 

Adaptation is, first of all, a "process", rather than a physical part of a body. 
Adaptation... could no longer be considered a static condition, a product of a creative past, and became instead a continuing dynamic process. "Ernst Mayr".

An internal parasite (such as a fluke) is a good example: it has a very simple bodily structure, but still the organism is highly adapted to its particular environment. From this we see that adaptation is not just a matter of visible traits: in such parasites critical adaptations take place in the life cycle, which is often quite complex.

However, as a practical term, adaptation is often used for the "product": those features of a species which result from the process. Many aspects of an animal or plant can be correctly called adaptations, though there are always some features whose function is in doubt. By using the term "adaptation" for the evolutionary "process", and "adaptive trait" for the bodily part or function (the product), the two senses of the word may be distinguished.

Adaptation is one of the two main processes that explain the diverse species we see in biology. The other is speciation (species-splitting or cladogenesis). A favourite example used today to study the interplay of adaptation and speciation is the evolution of cichlid fish in African lakes.

An organism must be viable at all stages of its development and at all stages of its evolution. This places "constraints" on the evolution of development, behaviour and structure of organisms.

The general idea is that each genetic and phenotypic change during evolution should be relatively small, because developmental systems are so complex and interlinked. But polyploidy in plants is a fairly common large genetic change. The origin of the eukaryota by the symbiosis of micro-organisms is a more exotic example.

All adaptations help organisms survive in their ecological niches. This implies an increase in biological fitness.

These adaptive traits may be structural, behavioural or physiological. Structural adaptations are physical features of an organism (shape, body covering, armament; and also the internal organization).

Behavioural adaptations are composed of inherited behaviour chains and/or the ability to learn: behaviours may be inherited in detail (instincts), or a tendency for learning may be inherited (see neuropsychology). Examples: searching for food, sex, vocalizations.

Physiological adaptations permit the organism to perform special functions (for instance, making venom, secreting slime, phototropism); but also more general functions such as growth and development, temperature regulation, ionic balance and other aspects of homeostasis. Adaptation, then, affects all aspects of the life of an organism.

Important adaptations do not come singly. They come in groups, which work together to make the animal or plant successful in its particular niche or life-style.

Woodpecker adaptations are a good example of how a whole suite of features are needed for a successful way of life.

Ancestral woodpeckers, which switched to climbing on tree trunks, had ancestral foot and tail structure. This suggests that a change in behaviour, perhaps to get at a better food source, was one of the first things that happened in the chain of events. The way evolutionary novelties start is an important topic.

Not all features of an organism are adaptations. It may need field investigations or experiments to find out whether it has a function in the life of the species.

Adaptations tend to reflect the past life of a species. If a species has recently changed its life style, a once valuable adaptation may become a dwindling vestige. Animals which live in dark caves often lose, over a long period, their colours and eyesight. 

The reasons for this may vary. The loss of structure and function may be a positive adaptation which saves energy and materials. But it may be simply a by-product of genes selected for other functions (pleiotropy). Or the structure may be linked in development, and affected by selection for some other structure. 

It is a general rule that any adaptations which are no longer useful either become vestigial organs (see vermiform appendix), or may be selected and adapted to other functions (see ear ossicles).

Many adaptations serve more than one function. This is often the reason some traits become so noticeable that they almost define the species concerned. The legs of a horse are also a main defence: a horse's kick is very destructive. The antlers of male deer serve a sexual function as well as a defence against predators. Man's large brain serves not only for language, but also for thinking and problem-solving. Bird feathers are not just used to fly; they are the basis of its heat conservation, temperature regulation and signalling

It is a profound truth that Nature does not know best; that genetical evolution... is a story of waste, makeshift, compromise and blunder. "Peter Medawar".
Adaptations are never perfect. There are always tradeoffs between the various functions and structures in a body. It is the organism as a whole which lives and reproduces, therefore it is the complete set of adaptations which gets passed on to future generations.
All adaptations have a downside: horse legs are great for running on grass, but they cannot scratch their backs; mammals' hair helps temperature regulation, but offers a niche for ectoparasites. Compromise and make-shift occur widely, not perfection. Selection pressures pull in different directions, and the adaptation that results is some kind of compromise.
Since the phenotype as a whole is the target of selection, it is impossible to improve simultaneously all aspects of the phenotype to the same degree. "Ernst Mayr".

Camouflage to avoid detection is destroyed when vivid colours are displayed at mating time. Here the risk to life is counterbalanced by the need for reproduction. The peacock's ornamental train (grown anew in time for each mating season) is a famous adaptation. It must reduce his maneuverability and flight, and is hugely conspicuous; also, its growth costs food resources.

Darwin's explanation of its advantage was in terms of sexual selection: "it depends on the advantage which certain individuals have over other individuals of the same sex and species, in relation to reproduction". The kind of sexual selection represented by the peacock is called 'mate choice', meaning the process selects the more fit over the less fit, and so has survival value. In practice, the blue peafowl "Pavo cristatus" is a pretty successful species, with a big natural range in India, so the overall outcome of their mating system is quite viable.

The size of the human foetal brain at birth means the brain of a newborn child is quite immature. The newborn's brain cannot be larger than about 400ccs, else it will not get through the mother's pelvis. Yet the size needed for an adult brain is about 1400ccs.

The most vital things in human life (locomotion, speech) just have to wait while the brain grows and matures. That is the result of the birth compromise. Much of the problem comes from our upright bipedal stance, without which our pelvis could be shaped more suitably for birth. Neanderthals had a similar problem.

The function of a trait can, and often does, change over time. Several terms have been used to describe this: "preadaptation", "exaptation", "cooption". 'Preadaptation' is the most common term used when a preexisting structure or trait inherited from an ancestor evolves a different function. It was the term used by Julian Huxley and Ernst Mayr. The term 'pre-' does not mean any foresight, it just means the adaptation was already available, serving some older function. 'Exaptation' was Stephen J. Gould's word.

One example of preadaptation is in dinosaurs, which evolved feathers with the function of thermo-insulation and display long before they were used for flight by early birds. Sweat glands in mammals were later transformed into mammary glands. Another example is the long journey of the mammalian ear ossicles, which started in the gill covers of ancient fish, then became part of the lower jaw of reptiles, and then became part of the inner ear of mammals. Another example is the wings of penguins. Once used for flying, they are now used for 'flying' under water.

Change of function in organs and structures is extremely common in evolution. Many of the features of tetrapods (land vertebrates) evolved from features with different functions in the ancestral lobe-finned fish (Sarcopterygii).

The following definitions are mainly due to Theodosius Dobzhansky.


Amaranth (color)

Amaranth is a rose-red color that is the color of the flower of the amaranth plant.

The first written use of "amaranth" as a color name in English was in 1690.

The name "amaranth" comes from the Greek "a" (not) + "marainean" (to waste away). A flower that never died that was believed to grow on Mount Olympus.
Amaranth flowers come in many different colors:

Cobra Starship

Cobra Starship was an American alternative dance band. The group started in 2005 in New York City. They are most famous for their songs "Snakes on a Plane (Bring It)" and "Good Girls Go Bad". They are currently signed to record label Fueled by Ramen.

Cobra Starship officially dissolved on November 10, 2015.



San Felipe de Puerto Plata

The Dominican city of San Felipe de Puerto Plata, usually called just Puerto Plata is the head municipality of the Puerto Plata province, on the north (Atlantic) coast of the country.

The name Puerto Plata ("Silver Port") came from the name given by Columbus to the mountain just to the south of the city: "Monte de Plata" ("Silver Mountain") because the mountain always had clouds on its top and not because there was the metal silver; that mountain now is called Isabel de Torres mountain (in Spanish, the complete name is "Loma Isabel de Torres"). Isabel de Torres was a lady who lived in Puerto Plata in 1605 and had a lot of land in the mountain.

The city was called first "Puerto de Plata" but later it was changed to just "Puerto Plata", the name that is still used

Columbus visited the Puerto Plata Bay on 11 January 1493. The city was founded and built by Nicolás de Ovando in 1502. Soon it became the most important port in the northern coast of the Hispaniola island and, in 1508, the king of Spain gave a coat of arms to the city.

Because there were many pirates and other British and French ships along the northern coast of the island, a fort was built here by orders of Carlos I, king of Spain; its construction took several years and it was finished in 1577. Because at that moment the Spanish's king was Felipe II, the fort was named Fuerte San Felipe (in English, "Saint Phillip Fort").

In 1606, those that were living in the towns of Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi were ordered by the Spanish king to move to the southeast of the island and to found a new town: Monte Plata. Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi were, then, destroyed. They were founded again in the 18th century with families that came from the Canary Islands.

The municipality had, in , a total population of 128,240: 63,564 men and 64,676 women. The urban population was of the total population.

San Felipe de Puerto Plata has a total area of (without including its municipal districts), about of the total area of the province of Puerto Plata. The city is at an elevation of , and at to the north of Santo Domingo.

The "Cordillera Septentrional" ("Northern mountain range") runs along the southern half of the municipality. There are only two roads that go through this mountain range. It rains a lot in these mountains.

The mountain "Loma Isabel de Torres" (the "Monte de Plata" of Columbus) is at about to the southeast of the city of Puerto Plata. It stands alone even if it is part of the Cordillera Septentrional. On top of the mountain, there is rainforest because it gets a lot of rain there; it rains almost every day. That forest is now a national park. It is high and there are two ways for getting to the top: by road or by a cable car (a type of car that runs on cables above the car).

There are many rivers in the municipality but, because the Cordillera Septentrional is close to the coast, they are all very short. The two most important rivers are Camú del Norte and Yásica. Two small rivers that are close to the city are San Marcos and Muñoz.

There are some bays along the coast. Two of them are the "Puerto Plata Bay" and "Maimón Bay".

Puerto Plata has a tropical wet climate (Köppen-Geiger classification: Af) with no dry or cold season as it is constantly moist (rainfalls during the whole year).

The average amount of rainfall for the year in the city is . The month with the most precipitation on average is December with of rainfall, followed by November with .

The driest season is summer. The month with the least rainfall on average is July with an average of and the second is June with .

Puerto Plata is in a warm region; the average temperature for the year is . The warmest month, on average, is July with an average temperature of . The coolest month on average is February, with an average temperature of .

The municipality of San Felipe de Puerto Plata has two municipal districts:

North Cascades

The North Cascades are a name used for the mountains at the north end of the Cascade Range, south of Canada. The North Cascades are entirely in the United States, in the state of Washington. At the Canadian border, the North Cascades are called the Canadian Cascades. The highest point in the North Cascades is Mount Baker (10,781 ft/3,286m). North Cascades National Park is located at the northernmost end of the North Cascades.

Some of the primary rivers in the North Cascades are the Skagit, Nooksack, Stillaguamish, and Stehekin. Lake Chelan is the largest lake in the North Cascades. Although now termed a reservoir, it was originally a natural lake, but enlarged by a dam. The urban areas of Seattle, Tacoma and Everett are all west of the North Cascades. The Columbia River, Washington's largest river, forms the east and south boundary.

The Point!

The Point! is a 1971 animated cartoon movie, written by singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson and Carole Beers, and directed by Fred Wolf. It first appeared on ABC television, in the United States. It starred the voices of Mike Lookinland ("Bobby" of "The Brady Bunch" fame), and actor Dustin Hoffman. (Later editions replaced Hoffman's voice with that of Alan Thicke, then musician Ringo Starr.)

"The Point!" tells a story about a boy named Oblio (Mike Lookinland), who is the only round-headed person in a land full of people and animals with pointed heads. Banished to the Pointless Forest for not conforming to what is "normal", Oblio and his dog Arrow (Don Messick) (whose head was pointed, but he was still loyal to Oblio) meet many different people, and come to learn that everything and everyone indeed has a "point"; a purpose for being what they are. Oblio and Arrow return home, bringing back what they have learned to share with everyone.

Harry Nilsson said later the inspiration for "The Point!" was an LSD experience. Resting on the ground, he noticed everything (trees, buildings) that reached into the sky from the ground came to a "point", leading Nilsson to believe that "everything has a point, and if it doesn't, then there's a point to that". Nilsson developed this idea into a story about tolerance, and acceptance of uniqueness in others.


Nilsson devoted a whole album to music from "The Point!", alternating songs from the show with his own of the story. "Me And My Arrow" became the breakout hit from the album, with a single reaching the Top 20 in the American music charts. (The song was later used in a commercial, for the Plymouth Arrow automobile.)

Nilsson later adapted "The Point!" into a musical stage play, that featured more of his own songs. A London production of the play reunited former Monkees Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones, who were also friends of Nilsson's.

Darwinius

Darwinius is a genus of primates known from only one fossil. It was discovered in 1983 by an amateur at the Messel Pit. This is a disused shale quarry noted for its astonishing fossil preservation, near the village of Messel, about 35 km (22 miles) southeast of Frankfurt am Main in Germany.

The fosssil dates from the Eocene epoch, 47 million years ago. The genus "Darwinius" was named to celebrate Charles Darwin on his bicentenary and the species name "masillae" honors Messel, where the specimen was found. The creature appeared superficially similar to a modern lemur. It is the only known specimen of its species.

The fossil, nicknamed 'Ida', was divided into a slab and partial counterslab after the excavation. The two parts were sold separately, was not reassembled until 2007. 

The specimen was privately collected and sold in two parts. Only the lesser part was known earlier. The second part shows that the skeleton is the complete primate fossil known. It includes the skeleton, soft body outline and contents of the digestive tract. 

Skull radiography shows teeth developing within the juvenile face. The individual was a weaned and independent-feeding female that died in her first year of life. She was "an agile, nail-bearing, generalized arboreal quadruped living above the floor of the Messel rain forest".

Redmond Barry

Redmond Barry (1813—1880), was a judge in Victoria, Australia. He is famous for being the person who started the University of Melbourne and the State Library of Victoria. As a judge he is famous for sentencing bushranger Ned Kelly to death. He was also the judge in the trials of the rebel miners from the Eureka Stockade in Ballarat, Victoria.

Transport network

A transport network, or transportation network is a network of roads, railways, streets, pipes, power lines, or any structure that lets either movement of vehicles or flow of some commodity.

Buxton

Buxton is a spa town in Derbyshire, England. It is the highest market town in England. Buxton is near to Cheshire and Staffordshire. Buxton is described as "the gateway to the Peak District National Park". Buxton is also close to Manchester.

"Poole's Cavern", a limestone cavern, and St Ann's Well are in Buxton. Also in the town is an Opera House.

The Romans developed the town when it was called Aquae Arnemetiae (or the spa of the goddess of the grove). Roman coins have been found in Buxton. The town largely grew in importance in the late 18th century when it was developed by the Dukes of Devonshire, with a second revival a hundred years later as the people visited to use the healing properties of the waters.

The Dukes of Devonshire have been helping Buxton since 1780, when the Duke used his money from his copper mines to develop the town as a spa like Bath.

Bess of Hardwick had taken one of her four husbands, the Earl of Shrewsbury, to "take the waters" at Buxton shortly after he became the jailer of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1569.

Dr. Erasmus Darwin recommended the waters at Buxton to Josiah Wedgwood. The Wedgwood family often went to Buxton on holiday. Two of Charles Darwin's half-cousins, Edward Levett Darwin and Reginald Darwin also settled there.


Buxton is twinned with two other towns—Oignies in France and Bad Nauheim in Germany.


Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll is an 1865 childrens’ story written by Charles Dodgson and illustrated by John Tenniel. Dodgson used Lewis Carroll as a pen name when writing poetry and fiction.

The story is more well known as Alice in Wonderland and is the basis for many adaptations in films, art and music.

One of the very commonly used phrases today - “down the rabbit hole” - comes from the beginning of the story. Alice is a young girl who, while falling asleep outside on a golden afternoon, sees a white rabbit and follows it into a rabbit hole. When she falls down the rabbit hole, she begins her fantastical adventures in Wonderland. 

Her adventures include distortions of time and proportion. Throughout the story she shrinks and grows repeatedly as she meets characters of all kinds and sizes, including the iconic Caterpillar who asks “Who are you?” and Cheshire Cat who asks her “Where do you want to go?”

The story starts with Alice sitting with her sister beside a lake. Suddenly, a white rabbit runs by. Alice runs after him. She finds his rabbit hole. She falls through the hole. She meets many characters underground and has some amazing adventures. She grows larger or smaller by eating different things like cakes and mushrooms. At the end, she enters a lovely garden. The Knave of Hearts is charged with stealing some tarts. A trial is held. Alice thinks the trial is ridiculous. She says so. Everyone is offended. There is a great commotion. Alice suddenly wakes up. She is back where she started, sitting with her sister beside the lake.

The story was told on a summer outing to three little girls. One of them was named Alice Liddell. Alice asked Dodgson to write the story down. Dodgson accepted the task. It took two years.

The story was first called "Alice's Adventures Under Ground". When Dodgson prepared the "Alice" story for publication, he added more events, such as the Mad Hatters's Tea Party, new characters, such as the Cheshire Cat, and changed the title to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland".

The story was so popular that Dodgson, (under the pen name Lewis Carroll), wrote a sequel called "Through the Looking-Glass". The Alice stories, often known as "Alice in Wonderland", are popular in music, movies and plays.

The book has been adapted many times to movies and television. These adaptations include:

Montreal Wanderers

The Montreal Wanderers were a professional men's ice hockey team that played in Montreal, Quebec at the Montreal Arena, and were one of the founding franchises of the National Hockey League in the 1917–18 NHL season. The Wanderers won a total of eight Stanley Cup challenges within a span of five seasons from 1906 to 1910. Prior to the formation of the NHL, the "Redbands" were one of the most successful teams in hockey.

£sd (pronounced, and sometimes written, L.s.d.) was the popular name for the pre-decimal currencies (sterling) used in the United Kingdom and in most of the British Empire. This abbreviation meant “pounds, shillings, and pence”. It is different when compared to American currency.

Quebec Bulldogs

The Quebec Bulldogs were a men's senior-level ice hockey team officially known as the Quebec Hockey Club, later as the Quebec Athletic Club. Their recorded play goes back as far as the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) in 1889, although the Quebec Hockey Club is known to have played in tournaments prior to that date. The club continued as an amateur team through various leagues, eventually becoming professional in 1908, and eventually playing in the National Hockey League. The "Bulldog" name was given by the media and was so popular with the fans a Bulldog mascot was created but was never officially changed until the team moved to Hamilton, Ontario in 1920 and became the Tigers.

Three-body problem

The three-body problem is a problem in the field of physics. The goal is to find how three things move when they attract each other with gravity. It would be for instance the problem of the movement of the Sun, the Earth and the Moon. Physicists do not have a general solution that always works.

"Relativistic" refers to the theory of Albert Einstein called Relativity. This theory must be used when things move at great speed. But as long as things move at small enough speed, you can use every day classical mechanics, and this is called "non-relativistic movement". You know if the speed is great or small enough by comparing to the speed of light "c," which is the highest possible speed.

In non-relativistic physics, one must know the place and velocity of the three things. One must also know their masses. Then one uses Newton's laws of motion to learn how the things move.

When a thing is moving, it has energy of movement. Scientists use a short-cut when they talk about this energy, they call it 'E.'

In a field called General relativity, experts say that movement with higher velocities causes the radiation of gravitational waves. In this case, the thing moving loses energy, and this makes calculation more difficult. Experts say that the system is "not conservative".

Experts in another field called Quantum mechanics say, in addition, at high speed the creation and annihilation of particles becomes possible, so, it is not possible to keep the number of particles constant.

There is no relativistic solution that always works for the movement of two or three things.

The three-body problem also happens in astronomy. The problem consists in calculating the course of three bodies, that influence each other with gravitation. The first to state the problem was Isaac Newton, in "Principia". Usually, two of the bodies are large, and the third is small. In the case where the two bodies have the same gravitational force, and that the bodies all have the same mass can be solved exactly. If this is not the case, the problem is solved through iteration and approximation. Many different patterns of motion can occur.

Plum Warner

Sir Pelham Francis Warner, known as Plum, (born 2 October 1873 in Port of Spain, Trinidad – died 30 January 1963 at West Lavington, West Sussex), was an England cricketer and a tour manager for England. He was tour manager during the 1932-33 "bodyline" tour of Australia where England bowled high and fast balls to the body of the Australian batsman, especially the famous Don Bradman.

Douglas Jardine

Douglas Robert Jardine (Bombay, Indian Empire 1900 – Montreux, Switzerland 1958) was an English cricketer and captain of the England cricket team from 1931 to 1933–34. A right-handed batsman, he played 22 Test matches for England, captaining the side in 15 matches, winning nine, losing one and drawing five.

Jardine is best known for captaining the English team during the 1932–33 Ashes tour of Australia. There, his team used 'bodyline' tactics against Donald Bradman and other opposing Australian batsmen. A bodyline delivery was one where the cricket ball was pitched short so as to rise towards the body of the opposing batsman on the line of the leg stump. The plan was to get legside deflections that could be caught by one of several fielders on the leg side. This tactic was considered by many to be intimidatory and physically threatening. Jardine is widely regarded by commentators and writers as the person responsible for that strategy.

The spearhead of the England attack was the coal miner's son Harold Larwood, the fastest bowler of the day. Larwood's partner was Bill Voce, also a top-class fast bowler. Ranged against them was the great Don Bradman, then averaging over 100 in Test matches.

A controversial figure among cricketers, Jardine was well known for his dislike of Australian players and crowds. In return, he was unpopular in Australia, for his manner and the bodyline strategy. Many of his players thought him an excellent captain, though not everyone thought him as good at managing people.

Jardine joined the British Army in August 1939. Once World War II began, he was commissioned into the Royal Berkshire Regiment and went with the British Expeditionary Force to France. He served at Dunkirk, where he was fortunate to escape but suffered some injuries. After serving as staff captain at St. Albans, he was posted to India for the remainder of the war. He served in Quetta, and then Simla, as a major. He became fluent in the Hindustani language. He gave lectures and played some cricket while in India. He left the army in 1945.

The Oval

The Oval is a place in London, England where important cricket matches are played. The Oval is the home place for Surrey County Cricket Club when they play other counties and England often play their last home test matches there at the end of the summer.

The Oval is located in Kennington, South London. The nearest tube station is also called Oval but you can get to the place easily from Vauxhall station.

Trophallaxis

Trophallaxis in biology refers the sharing of food by members of a community. 

It is most highly developed in social insects such as ants, termites, wasps and bees. The word was introduced by the entomologist William Morton Wheeler in 1918. The behaviour has been used to explain theories of how social behaviour developed in insects. The French psychologist and entomologist August Forel also believed that food sharing was key to ant society. He used an illustration of it as the frontispiece for his book "The social world of the ants compared with that of man".

Trophallaxis serves as a means of communication, at least in bees and ants. In some species of ants, it may play a role in spreading the colony odour that identifies members.

Oval tube station

Oval tube station in Kennington is a station on the Northern line of the London Underground. It is between Stockwell and Kennington stations. It is the only station on the Morden branch of the Northern line whose name begins with a vowel. Oval station is in Travelcard Zone 2. It is named for The Oval, which it serves.


Nikolaus Harnoncourt

Nikolaus Harnoncourt (born Berlin, 6 December 1929, died St. Georgen im Attergau, 5 March 2016) was an Austrian conductor. He was famous for his conducting music from many years ago using orchestras with period instruments.

Harnoncourt was born in Berlin into a noble family who were related to the Holy Roman Emperors and other European royalties. His full name was Johann Nicolaus Graf de la Fontaine und d’Harnoncourt-Unverzag. He was brought up in Graz, Austria and studied music in Vienna.

From 1952 to 1969 he was a cellist with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. He soon became interested in performing old music with period instruments. He started a group called Concentus Musicus Wien. They tried to make the music of composers from the Baroque period sound like it had done when it was written. Harnoncourt played the viola da gamba as well as the cello. In 1970 he conducted Monteverdi's opera "Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria" at La Scala, Milan.

In 1971, Harnoncourt started to work with the conductor Gustav Leonhardt. They recorded all of J.S. Bach's cantatas. This project took until 1990 to finish. He also recorded Bach's "St. Matthew Passion". He performed with many other orchestras, including the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. Often they were orchestras who used modern instruments, but he tried to make them play with an understanding of a historical style (bowing, phrasing etc). Like other musicians working with historical instruments, he gradually realized that music from later periods such as the Classical music period and even the Romantic period used to sound different from what we usually hear today. He recorded the symphonies and concertos of Beethoven. He received many awards for these recordings.

Harnoncourt was married to Alice until his death. The couple had a daughter, Elisabeth von Magnus, and three sons: Philipp, Franz and Eberhard (who died in 1990). Harnoncourt retired in December 2015 because of an illness. Harnoncourt died on 5 March 2016 from the illness. He was aged 86.



Roger Norrington

Sir Roger Norrington OBE (born 16 March 1934) is a British conductor who is famous for conducting music from historical periods using period instruments.

Norrington studied at Clare College, Cambridge and the Royal College of Music where his teachers included Adrian Boult.

Norrington started his career singing tenor. In 1962 he formed the Schütz Choir (later the Schütz Choir of London). From 1969 to 1984, he was conductor (music director) of Kent Opera. In 1978 he formed the London Classical Players and he conducted them until 1997. From 1985 to 1989 he was Principal Conductor of the Bournemouth Sinfonietta. From 1990 to 1994, he was music director of the Orchestra of St. Luke's. In 1998, he became principal conductor of the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra. He became Artistic Advisor of the Handel and Haydn Society in 2006.

Norrington is best known for performances of Baroque, Classical and Romantic music using period instruments and period style. He likes his orchestras to play with very little vibrato.

He conducted the Last Night of The Proms for the first time on 13 September 2008.

Norrington was made an OBE in 1980, a CBE in 1990 and a Knight Bachelor in 1997.

Surrey County Cricket Club

Surrey County Cricket Club are a cricket team who play first class county leagues. They play their home games at The Oval in Kennington, South London.

Gustav Leonhardt

Gustav Leonhardt (born 's-Graveland, Netherlands, 30 May 1928, died Amsterdam, 16 January 2012) was a famous Dutch harpsichordist, organist and conductor who became well known for playing music from historical periods on period instruments. At the beginning of his career the harpsichord was not yet a popular instrument and music from the Renaissance and Baroque periods was usually played in the same way as music from later centuries. Gustav Leonhardt made his audiences aware of what music by Johann Sebastian Bach would have sounded like in Bach's day.

Gustav Leonhardt was born into a Dutch, Protestant family who lived in the countryside. His Protestantism was an important part of his life. His father was a wealthy business man. His parents were both very keen amateur musicians. When Gustav was ten they bought a harpsichord. When World War II broke out life was hard in the country and Leonhardt often had to hide under the floorboards so that he was not sent away to slave labour. When he was not hiding he spent a lot of time practising the harpsichord. 

Gustav Leonhardt studied organ and harpsichord at the Schola Cantorum in Basel. At that time this was the only place in Europe where it was possible to study how to play early music. He went to Vienna to study conducting because his parents thought that being a conductor was a good way to earn a lot of money. However, Gustav was never very keen on conducting and he spent all his time there in the library studying music scores and copying music out. Most of this music had never been published and had not been performed since the time it was composed. 

In 1952 he became professor of harpischord at the Vienna Hochschule fur Musik. He met Nikolaus Harnoncourt who had similar interests to his. He soon became professor of harpsichord at the Amsterdam Conservatorium and remained there until 1988. He was also organist at the Waalse Kerk, Amsterdam. This church has a very famous historical organ. He became well known for his harpsichord concerts and recordings. He led the Leonhardt Baroque Ensemble with the English counter-tenor Alfred Deller with whom he made one of the first recordings of some Bach cantatas. The ensemble included his wife Marie, as well as Nikolaus Harnoncourt who played the cello. Together with Harnoncourt he conducted and recorded all Bach's cantatas.

Leonhardt lived in a big 16th century house facing one of the canals in the centre of Amsterdam. He looked very serious on the concert platform, but he had a sense of humour and occasionally played a bit of ragtime at the end of a recital.

Leonhardt died in Amsterdam on 16 January 2012.


Vienna Symphony

The Vienna Symphony () is an orchestra in Vienna, Austria.

The orchestra was formed in 1900 by the conductor Ferdinand Löwe. It was then called the "Wiener Concertverein" (Vienna Concert Society). In 1913 it moved into the Konzerthaus, Vienna. In 1919 it joined with the Tonkünstler Orchestra. In 1933 it got the name it has today: Vienna Symphony (Wiener Symphoniker).

During World War II the Nazis forced them to be part of the German Culture Orchestras and they were used for propaganda. They stopped playing in 1944.

Their first concert after the war was on 16 September 1945, when they performed Gustav Mahler's "Symphony No. 3". Their conductor Josef Krips quickly helped them to become a great orchestra. From 1946 they were often conducted by Herbert von Karajan who toured with them throughout Europe and North America. In 1959 the VSO performed for Pope John XXIII at Vatican City.

When Wolfgang Sawallisch became their conductor he toured with them to the United States and Japan.

Today Fabio Luisi is their chief conductor.




Liber Linteus

The Liber Linteus Zagrabiensis (or Liber Agramensis) (Latin: "Linen Book of Zagreb" or "Book of Agram") is the longest Etruscan text and the only existing linen book. 

Most of the text has not been translated, because the Etruscan language is only known little. According to the few words that can be understood, the text is probably a ritual calendar.

The fabric of the book was preserved when it was used to wrap a mummy from Ptolemaic Egypt. The mummy and the manuscript are now kept in a refrigerated room at the Archaeological Museum in Zagreb, Croatia.


Eel River

The Eel River is a river in the north part of the U.S. state of California. It flows north about 200 mi (322 km) to the Pacific Ocean, draining 3,684 square miles (9,542 square km). Its largest tributary is the Middle Fork Eel River, followed by the South Fork, Van Duzen River, and North Fork. The river is dammed near its headwaters to divert water into the Russian River valley. The two dams form Van Arsdale Reservoir and the larger Lake Pillsbury. Most of the river is in the humid Coast Ranges of California. Much of the river is isolated, in steep and rugged terrain. 

Towns along the Eel include Ferndale, Rio Dell, and Dos Rios (at the confluence with the Middle Fork). Weott is near the South Fork confluence.

U.S. Highway 101 follows the river until the South Fork confluence, and the Great Northern Railway also follows a portion of the river. 37 bridges cross the Eel and 24 cross the South Fork. The South Fork is the longest tributary. The Middle Fork has the largest watershed.

Cultivar

A cultivar is a variant of a plant that has been selected for planting and sale because it has certain characteristics. It keeps its traits when it is propagated because they are inherited. 

Usually, cultivars are given a name which is not related to their biological taxon. There is a system of naming run by the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (the ICNCP), commonly known as the Cultivated Plant Code. 


Plant propagation

Plant propagation is when a plant is distributed. There are several ways to do this:

Cardamom

Cardamom is the name used for two herbs related to ginger. Their seeds are used as a spice. The two species are named "Elettaria" and "Amomum". The seeds grow in a small seedpod. This seedpod is triangular in cross-section and has the shape of a spindle. There is a thin papery outer shell and small black seeds. Elettaria pods are light green in color, Amomum pods are larger and dark brown.

Elettaria is commonly known as "cardamom", "green cardamom" or "true cardamom". It grows from India to Malaysia. 

Amomum is usually called "black cardamom", or "white cardamom". It grows in Asia and Australia.

Both forms of cardamom are used to add flavor to both food and drink, as cooking spices and as a medicine. 
"Elettaria cardamomum" (the usual type of cardamom) is used as a spice and in medicine; it is also smoked sometimes; it is used as a food plant by the larva of the moth "Endoclita hosei".

Cardamom has a strong taste and an intense smell. Black cardamom has coolness similar to that of mint. It is commonly used in Pakistani cooking. In Scandinavia it is often used for baking. 

Green cardamom is one of the most expensive spices by weight but little is needed to give the flavor. Cardamom is best stored in pod form. Once the seeds are exposed or ground, they quickly lose their flavor. High-quality ground cardamom powder can often be a substitute for the pods. That way, ten pods is about the same quantity as one and a half teaspoons of ground cardamom. 

In the Middle East, green cardamom powder is used as a spice for sweet dishes. Traditionally, it is also added as a flavoring to coffee and tea there. In Arabic, cardamom is called "al-Hayl". In Persian, it is called "hel". In Hebrew, it is also called "hel" (הל). In Gujarati (a derivative of Sanskrit), it is "Ē-lī-chē".
In some Middle Eastern countries, coffee and cardamom are often ground in a wooden mortar and cooked together in a mihbaz, an oven using wood or gas, to produce mixtures that are as much as forty percent cardamom.

In South Asia, green cardamom is often used in traditional Pakistani sweets and in "Masala chai (spiced tea)". 

Black cardamom is sometimes used in garam masala for curries. It is occasionally used as a garnish in basmati rice and other dishes. It is often referred to as fat cardamom due its size ('Moti Elaichi'). Individual seeds are sometimes chewed, in much the same way as chewing-gum. It has also been known to be used to make gin. Cardamom was used to make the spiced wine, claret, in the Middle Ages.

In South Asia, Green cardamom is often used to treat infections of the teeth and gums. It is also used against troubles of the throat, congestion of the lungs and pulmonary tuberculosis, inflammation of eyelids and also digestive disorders. It has been used to break up kidney and gall stones, and as an antidote against the poison of certain snake bites. 

"Amomum" is used as a spice and as an ingredient in traditional medicine in systems of the traditional Chinese medicine in China, in Ayurveda in India, Japan, Korea and Vietnam.
Among other species, varieties and cultivars, "Amomum villosum" cultivated in China, Laos and Vietnam is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat stomach-aches, constipation, dysentery, and other digestion problems. "Tsaoko" cardamom "Amomum tsao-ko" is cultivated in Yunnan, China and northwest Vietnam, both for medicinal purposes and as a spice.

The demand for these herbs has increased since the 1980s. Growing cardamom has become an important source of income for many poor farmers. These people usually live in higher altitudes, sometimes in remote areas, in China, Laos and Vietnam. 

Until recently, Nepal has been the world's largest producer of large cardamom. Guatemala has become the world's largest producer and exporter of cardamom, with an export total of US$137.2 million for 2007.

Developed country

A developed country (also known as an industrialised country or more economically developed country (MEDC)) is a country that has more businesses and infrastructures (roads, airports, electricity, etc) than a developing country. The numbers most used for measuring economic growth is gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita income (average money per person). Others include the amount of industry, how much infrastructure there is, literacy, life expectancy and the basic standard of living. There is no exact way of saying what country is developed or developing. People often discuss the question of whose countries are the most developed ones,

Developed countries have , which means that the service sector becomes more important, and the is less important. Service sector jobs are those where a person does something for another, like selling or fixing a product. Industry sector jobs are actually making a product, usually in a factory. In a developed country, industry jobs may be moved (outsourced) to less developed countries that pay workers less money. Developing countries may be in the process of industrialization (building the factories and infrastructure) and underdeveloped countries usually depend on agriculture, often subsistence farming.

The first industrialised country was the UK, followed by Belgium. Later industrialised countries were Germany, the US, France and other Western European countries. According to , the current split between the developed and developing world is mostly an event of the 20 century.

According to the International Monetary Fund, developed countries supplied over half of the global GDP in 2010. In 2012, the "major advanced economies" were the US, Japan, Germany, France, the UK, Italy, and Canada. These are also called the G7.

The G7 has 10% of the world's population, but produces nearly 40% of the world's GDP. They also control many of the economic decisions that affect the world. The United Nations Security Council has five permanent members, four of those are in the G8 (G7 plus Russia).

Terms similar to "developed country" include "advanced country", "industrialised country", "more developed country (MDC), "more economically developed country (MEDC) (compared to "less economically developed country(LEDC)"), "Global North country", "first-world country", and " country". 

Economic criteria are usually seen as most important. This includes income per capita (average money for each person). Countries with high GDP per capita and mature industrialization are described as "developed countries". But modernization is not always seen as the only way to measure progress.

Recently, another measure, the Human Development Index (HDI), which combines jobs, income, along with access to medicine, life expectancy, and education has become prominent. The UN HDI is measures a country's level of human development. While there is a strong connection between a high HDI score and a prosperous economy, it is not always the case. The top 47 countries by HDI have scores ranging from 0.793 in Barbados to 0.955 in Norway. Many countries having an HDI of 0.788 and over (as of 2010), are also listed by IMF or CIA as "advanced" (as of 2009). The country of Bhutan started the idea of Gross National Happiness (GNH), to measure how happy people actually are. They felt the GNH was as important as GDP, and this idea has spread beyond Bhutan.

Market town

A market town is a settlement in Europe that has the right to have markets. This separates them from villages and cities. A town may be described as a market town or as having market rights even if it does not have a market anymore, provided the right to do so still holds.

Moped

A moped is a vehicle with two wheels and a motor, like a motorcycle but smaller. It usually has pedals, like a bicycle.

The size of the motor is usually 49cc, much smaller than most motorcycle motors. Because of the small motor, mopeds usually can not go faster than 50 kph (30 mph). Mopeds use less fuel than motorcycles, but some people complain that mopeds create more air pollution than motorcycles. Most of the time, you need a special license to ride a motorcycle but you only need an ordinary driver's license to ride a moped. It is usually illegal to ride a moped without a helmet.

Hagerstown, Maryland

Hagerstown () is a city in northwestern Maryland, United States. It is the county seat of Washington County, and one of the largest cities in a region known as Western Maryland. The population of Hagerstown city according to the 2020 United States Census is 43,527, and the total 2020 Urbanized Area population is 197,557.

Hagerstown anchors the Hagerstown-Martinsburg, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area, which lies just northwest of the Washington-Baltimore-Northern Virginia, DC-MD-VA-WV Combined Statistical Area in the Great Appalachian Valley. The population of the metropolitan area in 2020 was 293,844 (ranked 167th in the United States).

Hagerstown is a center of transit and commerce. Interstates 81 and 70, CSX, Norfolk Southern, and the Winchester and Western railroads, and Hagerstown Regional Airport cross in the city. Hagerstown is also the chief commercial and industrial hub for a greater Tri-State Area that includes much of Western Maryland as well as great extents of South Central Pennsylvania and the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia.

Algorithmic information theory

Algorithmic information theory is a field of theoretical computer science. It is concerned with how information and computation are related. Most information can be represented as a String (or a sequence of characters). Algorithmic information theory studies the complexity of information represented that way (In other words, how difficult it is to get that information, or how long it takes). Unlike regular information theory, it uses Kolmogorov complexity to describe complexity, and not the measure of complexity developed by Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver. Kolmogorov complexity was developed independently by Andrey Kolmogorov and Gregory Chaitin .

According to Claude Shannon the following two binary strings have the same content in information (this is only valid for the first-order entropy):

The first was generated with a random number generator, for example by throwing a coin. The second is easier to describe (eight times "1", then eight times "0"). For this reason, the first sequence has more algorithmic information, because it is harder to shorten ("compress") the description on how to generate it. Shortening the description may not be possible at all. The information value of a string is higher, if it is more difficult to shorten ("compress") its description. Random strings and white noise do not contain patterns that occur again. For this reason they cannot be compressed, and have a higher information value. 

Tawhid

Tawhid is the concept of God in Islam which says that only one God exists. It says that God is unique and one and He has no equal. It also says that since the God is the only creator, there is no room for lesser Gods or deities. Any lesser gods are therefore false. Tawhid is an essential part of Islam. To become a Muslim it is necessary to accept it. The concept of Tawhid has many implications. Since God is the only power, both good and bad flow from God. So, whatever good or bad occurs to an individual, both are from God and both should be accepted by the individual. Since God is the only power worth worshipping, reliance on any other source for help is not permissible.

The Qur'an explains the nature of God in Chapter 112:

Say: He is Allah, the One and Only; Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; None is born of Him, nor is He born; And there is no one like him.
Associating any other thing or person as being comparable to God is called "shirk" in Islam. This is the only sin in Islam which cannot be forgiven by God, unless a person turns repentant on Earth. The Koran can also be interpreted as telling Muslims to not follow the idea of the "trinity," the Christian concept for explaining God. Since the trinity views God as being made up of three different parts, many Muslims view this as believing in more than one god (shirk). On the other hand, Christians will say that they view the trinity as making up one God, so it is not believing in more than one god. The Koran also says that Jesus did not claim to be anything more than a human being, while in Christianity he is part of the trinity. According to Muslim scripture, Jesus claims to be prophet chosen by God, different from the divine status he has in Christianity.

Asperger syndrome

Asperger syndrome (often Asperger's syndrome) was a former type of autism spectrum disorder. The diagnosis was combined with autism in the DSM-5 and the ICD-11 and no longer exists. It has been replaced by autism spectrum disorder.

It affects the way in which a person understands, talks, and acts with other people. A person who has Asperger syndrome may not fit in well with other people and may be unable to act like everyone else in different social situations. Neurotypical (or NT) is a term that was coined in the autistic community as a label for those other people who are not on the autism spectrum. Asperger syndrome is thought to manifest as a developmental disorder, and is not considered a mental illness. Most adults with Asperger syndrome can learn how to make friends, do useful work, and live successful lives. People with it sometimes call themselves Aspies. 

People who have it will have to deal with it for the rest of their lives. However, they can try many solutions to help them and learn how to be able to reduce the impact on their life. One solution can be medication to restrict the different symptoms like aggression. The big problem with people affected by Asperger's is that they cannot understand emotions or how people think. Therapists attempt to help the person with that. They will do many activities like acting an emotion and letting the Asperger people guess what it is.

Asperger syndrome may be observed and diagnosed in early childhood. No one knows exactly what causes it, but it is thought to have a genetic cause. The part of the brain that controls a person's "social behavior" (understanding and communicating with other people) may grow or function differently in a person with Asperger syndrome. Another part of the brain that may be different is the part that controls some body movement such as balance. A person with this condition may walk or act in a clumsy way and have trouble doing body actions such as sports. They may also do physical actions repetitively, such as rocking, flapping their hands, or tapping their feet. The condition seems to run in families. Parents who have Asperger's syndrome often have children who have it or another kind of autism.

Asperger syndrome cannot be found by testing blood or looking at someone's body. A medical doctor needs to talk with the person and other people who know him or her well, to watch how the person moves and behaves, and to learn about the person's past. Sometimes a doctor believes by mistake that the person has schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, ADHD, or mental retardation instead. Tourette syndrome with "tics" (repetitive, uncontrolled actions like twitching, blinking, and coughing) sometimes comes with Asperger syndrome. Many people with Asperger syndrome also have ADHD and/or OCD. It has been estimated that beyond half of the people with the syndrome, also carry some other type of syndrome, disorder, disability, disease, or illness. The MSD Manual says "strong evidence supports a genetic component".

People who have Asperger syndrome have normal to high intelligence. As children, they may need special help at home and school to learn social behavior. The syndrome cannot be made better by taking medicine. People who have this condition are sometimes given medicine to help them with depression, which is often experienced by people with the syndrome.

People with Asperger syndrome can have a hard time fitting in with other people. This social awkwardness has been called "active but odd". Adults who have it usually learn enough "coping skills" to act in a way that seems normal, but often with a few differences. Most people with the syndrome can communicate clearly with friends and family. They may have more difficulty in communicating with new people. People who carry the syndrome can sometimes seem rude or uninterested during conversations, without meaning anything wrong. They may also get stressed or unsettled when things do not go their way.

Asperger's syndrome characteristics include:

Asperger syndrome is noticeable when the person acts differently in social situations. Their social disabilities can have different levels. Not all people with Asperger syndrome have the same level of it. This characteristic is not the only one. Someone who dislikes people in general does not necessarily have Asperger's. Other characteristics that can be identified is that people with Asperger's hate any changes in their routine. They also dislike having eye contact. Most of the time they will try to avoid it and look away. Usually, people with Asperger syndrome have less facial expression than anybody else. There are many characteristics, and if someone only has some of them then they likely don't have Asperger's. Commonly, people with the syndrome tend to hum or pronounce different sounds to themselves, which they have heard in their surroundings, such as a reporter's voice, a man on the radio, lyrics from songs, words, things they have read, or what people around them usually say. They may repeatedly mention these words or phrases again and again.

In the 1940s, a doctor named Hans Asperger studied some children who were different from most other children that he knew but were like each other. He called them "little professors" because he thought that they were interesting and wrote a book about them. Dr. Asperger thought his "little professors" had a different sort of personality.

In the 1980s Dr. Lorna Wing made up the name "Asperger syndrome" for people with high-functioning autism after research into Hans Asperger's work.

In 1994 Asperger syndrome was added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).

In 2013 Asperger syndrome was removed from the DSM.

In 2019, Asperger's syndrome was removed from the ICD. The diagnosis is now autism spectrum disorder.

Asperger syndrome is much more common in males than females. Statistics say that three males are affected for every one female.

It is widely discussed how common the syndrome is, as there are figures that show very different numbers. But, it probably lies between 1 in every 250, all the way up to 1 in every 10,000. A 2003 review of epidemiological studies of children found autism rates ranging from 0.03 to 4.84 per 1,000, with the ratio of autism to Asperger syndrome ranging from 1.5:1 to 16:1.

Mini

The Mini is a small car made by the British Motor Corporation (BMC), British Leyland and Rover from 1959 to 2000. It used a transverse engine and front-wheel drive, where the turning power was put on the front wheels of the car rather than the back wheels. Its design saved a large amount of space. It allowed most of the car's size to be used for passengers and luggage. It had only two doors, but could seat up to four passengers. 1959

The design was very influential for car-making in the second half of the 20th century. In 1999, the Mini was voted the second most influential car of the 20th century, behind the Ford Model T. The original model is considered an icon of the 1960s in Britain.

The original Mini was designed for BMC by Alec Issigonis.

It was first released in August 1959. Rover ceased production in October 2000. It was marketed under the names Austin, Morris, Cooper, Wolseley, Riley, British Leyland and Rover.

In 2001, the Mini was relaunched by BMW as a premium small hatchback which quickly became popular thanks to its retro styling, fun driving experience, many customisation options and strong resale values. It received redesigns in late 2006 and late 2013.

Edgar Adrian, 1st Baron Adrian

Edgar Douglas Adrian, 1st Baron Adrian OM PRS 30 November 1889 - 8 August 1977) was an English doctor. He won the 1932 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Charles Scott Sherrington for the discoveries about the functions of neurons.

Hydrogen deuteride

Hydrogen deuteride is a diatomic molecule. It is composed of the two isotopes of hydrogen: H protium and H deuterium.

Bond albedo

The Bond albedo is the fraction of power in the total electromagnetic radiation hitting an astronomical body which is scattered back out into space. It considers all wavelengths at all phase angles. It is necessary for estimating how much energy a planet or other body absorbs.

Geographical pole

A geographical pole is either of two points on the surface of a rotating planet where the axis of rotation meets the surface of the planet. The north geographical pole of a body is 90 degrees north of the equator. The south geographical pole lies 90 degrees south of the equator.

Relative to Earth's surface, the geographic poles move by a few metres over periods of a few years. 

As cartography requires exact and unchanging coordinates, the average positions of the geographical poles are taken as fixed. These "cartographic poles" become the points where the body's great circles of longitude intersect.


Spheroid

A spheroid is a kind of ellipsoid. It is got by rotating an ellipse about one of its principal axes. This means it is an ellipsoid with two equal semi-diameters.

Spheres are spheroids. Spheroids that are not spheres are either oblate or prolate.

Most celestial objects are oblate spheroids. They usually spin, and as they spin, centrifugal force pulls them into that shape. Few natural objects are prolate spheroids.


Invariable plane

The invariable plane of a planetary system is the plane passing through its barycenter (center of mass). 

In the Solar System, about 98% of this effect is from the mass of the four gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). The invariable plane is within 0.5° of the orbital plane of Jupiter. It is the weighted average of all planetary orbital and rotational planes.

The invariable plane is got from the sum of angular momenta, and is perpendicular to the angular momentum vector of the planets. It is almost invariable (unchanging) over the entire system. 

The Sun forms a counterbalance to all of the planets, so it is near the barycenter when Jupiter is on one side and the other three jovian planets (gas giants) are opposite on the other side. The Sun moves 2.17 solar radii away from the barycenter when all jovian planets are in line on other side. 

The orbital angular momenta of the Sun and all non-jovian planets, moons, and minor solar system bodies, as well as the axial rotation momenta of all bodies, totals only about 2%.

For almost all purposes the plane can be considered invariable (unchanging) when working in Newtonian dynamics.

G-Force

The g-force of an object is its acceleration relative to free fall. On earth this is 1g, or 9.8 meters per second squared (m/s^2) or equivalently  newtons of force per kilogram of mass (N/kg). Astronauts experience unusually high and low g-forces. G-force can also be seen on rollercoasters. When the coaster goes down the drop, you are pushed back into your seat because of g-force. Negative g-forces is when gravity is pushing you downwards causing you to feel weightless. (Going down a rollercoaster) Positive g-forces is when gravity is pushing against you causing you to feel heavier. (Going up a rollercoaster) 

Sidereal time

Sidereal time is a time-keeping system. It is used by astronomers to find celestial objects. Using sidereal time it is possible to point a telescope to the proper coordinates in the night sky. 

Sidereal time is a "time scale based on Earth's rate of rotation measured relative to the fixed stars". 

Because the Earth moves in its orbit about the Sun, a mean solar day is about four minutes longer than a sidereal day. Thus, a star appears to rise four minutes earlier each night, compared to solar time. Different stars are visible at different times of the year.

By contrast, solar time is reckoned by the movement of the Earth from the perspective of the Sun. An average solar day (24 hours) is longer than a sidereal day (23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds) because of the amount the Earth moves each day in its orbit around the Sun.


Scale height

A scale height is a term for a distance over which a quantity decreases by a factor of "e" (the base of natural logarithms). The scale height is usually shown by a capital letter "H".

Jupiter impact

Several impacts have been seen on the face of Jupiter

In July 1994, a comet broke up into many pieces and then crashed into Jupiter over the course of many days. The comet was called Shoemaker-Levy 9. The largest pieces left scars on the face of Jupiter. Some of the scars were larger than the Earth.

A large impact was observed with the Keck II telescope and its near-infrared camera at Mauna Kea on July 20 11:20 UT. It occurred on the surface of Jupiter.

Ja zuster, nee zuster

Ja zuster, nee zuster (in English: Yes Nurse, No Nurse) was a very popular comedy series on Dutch television in the late 1960s. It was set in a home for old people. The Dutch title literally means, "Yes, Sister; No, Sister"; because in the Netherlands, as in Britain and many other countries, female nurses of a certain rank are called "Sister".

The series was broadcast between 1966 and 1968 and consisted of 20 episodes. 

The script was written by Annie M.G. Schmidt who was already very well known as a writer of books for children and scripts for television and radio programmes. The songs were written by Harry Bannink.

Dutch people today, especially those who remember the original series, are very disappointed that, apart from one programme, the whole series has been lost. This is because it was recorded on Ampex tape which was very expensive so, after the episodes had been shown on television, other television programmes were recorded on the same tape over the top of it. Some of the film that was shot outside has been preserved. 15 of the songs from the series have also been preserved. They were made into a gramophone record (LP) and later into a CD.

A film with the same title, based on the series, was produced in 2002. It starred Loes Luca as Zuster (Sister) Klivia and Paul Kooij as her landlord and nextdoor neighbour, Buurman Boordevol.

The stories in the television series are about a group of people who live in “Rusthuis Klivia”. The word “rusthuis” means “resthouse”. It is usually used in Dutch to describe an old people’s home (retirement home), although some of the actors in the programme were not really old. There was always chaos in the home. The characters were very strange. One of them grew spinach in the garden, one of them was an engineer who was always doing experiments in the cellar. One of them was a burglar. The neighbour tries to get everyone evicted (thrown out), but he never succeeds. 

Each episode had a guest actor who was often a well-known Dutch television personality.

There were many songs in the series. The most popular ones include "De kat van ome Willem" ("Uncle Williams’ Cat"), "Ja Zuster, Nee Zuster" ("Yes Nurse, No Nurse"), "Niet met de deuren slaan" ("Don’t bang the doors") and "M'n opa" ("My grandpa").

In 1999 a book was published with reconstructions of the stories. An exhibition was opened between November 2002 and March 2003 in Hoorn, North Holland. A musical is now being made which should be ready by 2009. It will be performed in many theatres throughout the Netherlands.

Stewart Cink

Stewart Ernest Cink (born May 21, 1973) is an American professional golfer. Cink won the 2009 Open Championship, beating five-time winner Tom Watson in a four-hole playoff. He spent 39 weeks in the top 10 of the Official World Golf Rankings from 2004 to 2008.

Cink was born in Huntsville, Alabama and grew up in Florence, where he attended Bradshaw High School. He completed high school in 1991 and he attended Georgia Tech in Atlanta, where he played golf for the Yellow Jackets; he turned professional in 1995. After winning the Mexican Open and three events on the Nike Tour (now the Nationwide Tour) in 1996, Cink joined the PGA Tour in 1997 and won the Canon Greater Hartford Open in his rookie season. Cink performed consistently on the Tour over the next few years, picking up another win at the 2000 MCI Classic. Until his victory in the Open Championship in 2009, 2004 was his career year to date, with a fifth-place finish on the money list and wins at the MCI Heritage and at the WGC-NEC Invitational, which is one of the World Golf Championships events and was the most prestigious win of his career at the time. In 2009 he won his first career major with a playoff victory over 59-year old Tom Watson in The Open Championship.

On February 24, 2008, Cink was the runner-up in the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship played in Marana, Arizona, falling 8 & 7 in the 36-hole final to top-ranked Tiger Woods. In June 2008, he reached his highest ever ranking, sixth, in the Official World Golf Rankings with his victory at the Travelers Championship in suburban Hartford.

On July 19, 2009, Cink won his first major title at the 138th Open Championship at Turnberry, Scotland, defeating 59 year-old Tom Watson by six strokes in a four-hole playoff. Cink had birdied the 72nd hole while Watson bogeyed, which forced the playoff.

ATP synthase

ATP synthase is an enzyme found in cells that makes ATP from ADP(adenosine di-phosphate) and inorganic phosphate. The ATP synthase is powered by the difference of concentration of pH between inside and outside the place where the enzyme is located. The exact mechanism in which it does so is unknown, although it is believed to work like a rotating machine. 

Bayreuth Festival

The Bayreuth Festival (German: Bayreuther Festspiele, Bavarian: "Bareida Festspui", East Franconian: "Baraida Fesdspil") is a music festival held every year in Bayreuth, Germany, at which performances of operas by the 19th century German composer Richard Wagner are performed. It was Wagner's own idea to start a festival for his operas in Bayreuth in a theatre which he designed himself because he was not satisfied with the way that theatres were usually designed.

The theatre that he designed is called the Festspielhaus (Festival House). Wagner watched the theatre being built, making sure that it was done the way he wanted it. He had some new ideas about theatre design. For example: he wanted the orchestra pit to be so low that the orchestra would not be seen by the audience.

When the theatre was opened in 1876 his cycle of operas called the "Der Ring des Nibelungen" was performed complete for the first time.

The festival immediately became internationally famous. Almost every serious musician in Europe wanted to go to Bayreuth to hear Wagner's music performed there. Composers usually either loved it and were strongly influenced by it, or they hated it and reacted against it.

The festival still continues now. Every August there is a festival of Wagner's operas. It is extremely difficult to get tickets because so many people want to go. People often wait for ten years before they can get a ticket.

Wagner wanted the festival to be in a small town where people could just concentrate on his music. Bayreuth already had a theatre, the Markgräfliches Opernhaus, but it was not suitable for modern opera. The town did not have a cultural life that would be in competition with Wagner's music. Another reason for choosing Bayreuth was that it was in an area where the rights to perform his operas were still under his control (he had sold these rights in other areas many years earlier in order to raise money).

King Ludwig II of Bavaria gave a lot of money to Wagner to built the new opera house. Wagner also made tours across Germany to get money for it. Societies were established to raise money.

The architect who designed the opera house was Gottfried Semper.

The opening took place on August 13, 1876, with a performance of Das Rheingold. A lot of important people were there, including Kaiser Wilhelm, Dom Pedro II of Brazil, King Ludwig (who came in secret, perhaps because he did not want to meet the Kaiser), and other members of the nobility, as well as the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, and the composers Anton Bruckner, Edvard Grieg, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, and Franz Liszt. Hans Richter was the conductor.

During Wagner's life the festival just performed the Ring Cycle and, later, his opera "Parsifal". After Wagner's death, his widow Cosima continued to run the festival. She gradually introduced the other operas Wagner had written, so that all ten operas were in the repertoire. The operas were always performed exactly as Wagner had done. Nothing was allowed to be changed in any way.

After Cosima retired from running the festival in 1906, Wagner's son Siegfried took over management of the festival. He did some things differently, introducing new staging and performance styles. When he died in 1930 the festival was run by his widow Winifred.

In the 1920s, some years before the rise of the Nazi party, Winifred Wagner became a close friend of Adolf Hitler. Because of this, Bayreuth was able to continue getting a lot of money during the Nazi period. Wagner's works were used by the Nazi as propaganda tools. It is strange that Hitler went to performances in Bayreuth that included Jewish and foreign singers, long after they had been banned from performing in all other places in Germany. Winifred's influence with Hitler was so strong that Hitler even wrote a letter to the anti-fascist Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini, begging him to lead the festival. Toscanini refused.

It was during this time that the festival made its first break from tradition. They stopped using the 19th century scenery on the stage. Many people disagreed with this, including Toscanini and Richard Strauss, and even some members of the Wagner family. They thought it should stay exactly like Wagner had known it.

During the war, the Nazi party ran the festival. Operas were performed for soldiers who had been hurt in the fighting. These soldiers were forced to go to lectures on Wagner before the performances, even if they were not interested in music.

A lot of Bayreuth was destroyed by bombing in the last days of World War II, though the theatre itself was undamaged. After the war, Winifred Wagner was sentenced to probation by a war court because she had supported the Nazi party. Ironically, it was because of Winifred that the theatre was not bombed. She had not allowed it to be used for military purposes, so it was not a military target. After the war the theatre was used for other kinds of concerts for the next few years. The festival started again in 1951, opening with a performance of Beethoven's Symphony no 9, followed by a performance of Wagner's opera, "Parsifal"

Wieland Wagner, the composer's grandson, had some very new ideas, including very abstract scenery. Some of the audience even booed. What Wieland was trying to do was to make a big break from the past with its association with Hitler. Wieland died in 1966. For a time people wondered whether the festival would continue. There were a lot of arguments within the Wagner family. Wieland's brother Wolfgang Wagner remained in charge of running the festival for the next 42 years, while the money was controlled by the Richard Wagner Foundation.

Wieland Wagner started a workshop in Bayreuth in which directors could meet and discuss new ideas for presenting the operas. This made it easier for new ideas to be accepted, and gave new life to the festival.

The centenary of the festival was celebrated in 1976 with a great production of the Ring directed by the French director Patrice Chereau. His production concentrated on showing how the Ring was about the 19th century working class being used by the wealthy capitalists. Some people thought it was the best opera performance they had ever seen, others hated it.

There has been a lot of uncertainty about what would happen after Wolfgang retired. Many people wanted the festival to continue to be in the hands of the Wagner family. On 1 September 2008, Wolfgang Wagner's daughters, Eva Wagner-Pasquier and Katharina Wagner, were named by Bavaria's culture minister to take over the Festival. They have said that they want to "bring opera to the people". In 2009 Wagner's opera "Tristan und Isolde" will be live on the web. It will only cost £12.90 to watch online. People will also be able to watch it for free on a big screen in the centre of Bayreuth.


Repertoire

Repertoire (pronounce: "Re-per-twahr") is a French word used in music and in the theatre. It means a list of pieces of music or plays. Sometimes the English word repertory is used.

When a pianist speaks about his or her "repertoire", it means all the pieces that he can play. Most famous musicians have a wide repertoire (they can play a lot of pieces).

The "piano repertoire" means all music written for the piano. The violin has a much larger solo repertoire than the viola. That means that much more solo music has been written for the violin than for the viola.

A theatre company may have a "repertoire". That means all the plays that they regularly perform. Sometimes theatre companies are called "repertory theatres" because they have a particular list of plays that they perform.

Working class

Working class is a term used to describe people in society who have jobs which are not academic or highly paid. They're usually jobs which are physical, especially when they are paid an hourly wage.

Different societies will have different ideas about what "working class" is. People started talking about the working class after industrialization in the early 19th century. Karl Marx wrote about the working class.

Working class contrasts with middle class and upper class, which are above working class. The underclass is below the working class.


Ludwig II of Bavaria

Ludwig II (German: "Ludwig der Zweite von Bayern"; Ludwig Otto Friedrich Wilhelm; 25 August 1845 – 13 June 1886) was king of Bavaria from 1864 until shortly before his death (Bavaria is now part of Germany, but at that time it was a separate country). He is well known for his support for the composer Richard Wagner.

He is often referred to as the Mad King Ludwig because his behaviour was very odd. For example, he would leave his castle by climbing out of the window instead of walking out of the door. He is sometimes referred to as the Swan King in English and "der Märchenkönig" (the Fairy tale King) in German. This is because he built several very expensive and fancy castles, the most famous one being Neuschwanstein.

It is not clear whether his death by drowning was suicide or whether he was murdered.

Today tourists from all over the world visit the castles that he built. They also visit the Bayreuth Festspielhaus for which he gave a lot of money towards the building.

Ivan Regen

Ivan (Janez) Regen (called Johann Regen) (December 9, 1868 – July 27, 1947), was a Slovenian biologist. He is best known for his studies in bioacoustics, the science of hearing and communicating.

Regen was born in the village of Lajše (now Slovenia). His mother encouraged his interest in insect sounds. His father lost a lot of money bring cloth into Slovenia and could not pay for Ivan to go to school. Ivan was given a scholarship so that he could go to school at the local seminary. He was able to save enough money go to study in Vienna. He studied natural history at the University of Vienna with teachers Grobben, Exner and Claus. He got his doctorate in 1897 and began to work as a school teacher in Vienna, and later in Hranice, Moravia. Exner helped him get a job back in Vienna. He worked in a secondary school there until his retirement in 1918.

Regen began to study insects in great detail. He was one of the first Slovenian scientists to work in another country after World War I. He was the first scientist to study the grasshopper in a lot of detail. He studied katydid and cricket sounds, he proved that insects did react to sounds from each other. He was able to make crickets react to artificial sounds using a loudspeaker. In one experiment, he used a telephone to send sounds from one cricket to another in different rooms. Later, he showed that insects hear with their ear drum. He was the first person to work out what the ear drum does. He is the person who started the study of bioacoustics. He also studied the insects breathing, their hibernation, coloring, and how they shed their skin.

Regen's largest project was his "geobiological laboratory", a large glass cage, called a terrarium. He used this to study the way crickets could find other crickets using sounds; this is called phonotaxis. Using up to 1600 females with normal or damaged hearing, he was able to work out how they did this.

He worked for himself after 1911, but he supported several groups and organizations in Slovenia. He started using Slovene terminology in his areas of study. In 1921, he was asked to be a professor at the University of Ljubljana, but did not take it. In 1940, he became a member of Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts and was also a member of Slovenian Society of Natural History.

Even though he was a famous scientist known around the world, he was poor and lived alone. His experiments were paid for by the Austrian Academy of Sciences, but he was not allowed to be a member. He did all his work at home. After his death, a lot of his special equipment such as microphones, oscilloscopes, galvanometer, and his written notes were destroyed. 

Mole cricket

The mole crickets are the family Gryllotalpidae, of broad insects about 3–5 cm (1-2 inches) long, with large eyes and shovel-like forelimbs for burrowing and swimming.

Mole crickets are omnivores or meat eaters, feeding on larvae, worms, roots, and grasses. Common predators of mole crickets include birds, rats, skunks, armadillos, raccoons and foxes.

Hisashi Tsuchida

Tsuchida was born in Okayama on February 1, 1967. After graduating from Osaka University of Economics, he joined Japan Soccer League club Mitsubishi Motors (later "Urawa Reds") in 1989. He played many matches as goalkeeper from 1991. In 1992, Japan Soccer League was folded and founded new league J1 League. He battles with Yuki Takita for the position for a long time.

He could not play at all in the matches from 1999. He retired with rival Takita end of 2000 season.

In 1988, when Tsuchida was an Osaka University of Economics student, he was selected Japan national "B team" for 1988 Asian Cup. At this competition, he played one game. However, Japan Football Association don't count as Japan national team match because this Japan team was "B team" not "top team".

Gun dog

Gun dogs or gundogs, also called bird dogs, are types of dogs used to help hunters find and retrieve game (the animals the hunters are hunting), usually birds. 

Gundogs are divided into three primary types: retrievers, flushing dogs, and pointing breeds. Flushing dogs flush game from hiding. Pointer dogs point their muzzle towards game to allow the hunter to locate the animal. Retrievers retrieve game once it is killed. Some kennel clubs define a Gundog Group for gundogs, while other kennel clubs include them in the Sporting Group. The three most popular types are: Spaniel, Golden Retriever and Labrador.


Alaskan Klee Kai

The Alaskan Klee Kai is a northern breed of dog of the spitz type. The term "Klee Kai" was derived from Alaskan Athabaskan (Eskimo) words meaning "small dog". The breed was developed to create a pet sized version of the Alaskan Husky, but it more closely resembles the Siberian Husky. This result makes it an energetic, intelligent, apartment-sized dog with an appearance that reflects its northern heritage.

These dogs can come in a variety of different coat colors: black and white, gray and white, red and white and all white. They have a double coat, which means it is thicker.

In 1997, the United Kennel Club recognized the Alaskan Klee Kai. It is a rare breed with not very many dogs.


Alaskan Malamute

The Alaskan Malamute is a breed of domestic dog. It was originally bred for use as an Alaskan sled dog. This dog is usually large in size. It is sometimes mistaken for a Siberian Husky. The Alaskan Malamute is strong and powerful and was used to carry heavy loads for long distances. 

This dog is the largest and oldest of the Arctic sled dogs. Malamutes can be family pets, but are very active. They enjoy sledding, running and swimming with their owners. Their coat is thick and comes in colors from light gray to black or from sable to red. They have a plumed tail. 

Aidi

The Aidi or Chien de l'Atlas is a Moroccan dog breed used to protect flocks of sheep and goats. It also can hunt and smell very well.. In its native Morocco it is often paired in hunting with the Sloughi, which chases down prey that the Aidi has found by sniffing it out.


Airedale Terrier

The Airedale Terrier (often shortened to "Airedale") is a breed of the terrier type, that first came from Airedale, a geographic area in Yorkshire, England. 

It traditionally was called the "King of Terriers" because before the creation of the Black Russian Terrier, the Airedale was largest of the terrier breeds. The breed has also been called the Waterside Terrier, because it was bred to hunt otters in and around the valleys of the River Aire in Airedale. In England this breed has also been used as a police dog.

Xinjiang

Xinjiang (also transliterated as Sinkiang) is a northwestern region of the People's Republic of China. Like all of China, it is also claimed by the Republic of China. It is a large area with few people. It is over 1.6 million km, which takes up about one sixth of the country's land. It is mainly inhabited by Uyghurs who are Turkic people.

In the 19th century, when the name of the Silk Road was first used by a German geographer, it just included the land route from Xinjiang to Central Asia. Xinjiang sits at the heart of the Silk Road in China. At that time, the country was often called "Chinese Turkestan" for its many Turkic peoples.

Xinjiang borders the Tibet Autonomous Region and Jammu and Kashmir's Leh District to the south and Qinghai and Gansu provinces to the southeast, Mongolia to the east, Russia to the north and Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan to the west, Pakistan and Kashmir region to the southwest.

Ürümqi is the capital of Xinjiang and the largest city in Western China. It also holds the world record for being the most remote city from any sea in the world; it is 2,500 km from any coastline.

The east-west chain of the Tian Shan Mountains separate Dzungaria in the north from the Tarim Basin in the south. Dzungaria is dry steppe. The Tarim Basin is desert surrounded by oases. In the east is the Turpan Depression. The Taklamakan Desert is also in Xinjiang. Ürümqi, the capital, Turpan, Kashgar, Karamay, Yining and Shihezi are the major cities.

Ancyloxypha numitor

The least skipper ("Ancyloxypha numitor") is a butterfly in the family Hesperiidae. It is native to North America. They have a weak, bouncy flight.

The least skipper can be found in damp or wet habitats with tall grasses. In the northern part of the its range, adults may be seen from May to September. In the southern part of its range, adults can be found from February to December. It may be seen all year in southern Florida.

The least skipper has rounded wings and a skinny body. Their antennae are checkered and have no hooks. Male least skipper do not have stigmata. The upper side of the top wing is dark brown, sometimes having orange on it. The bottom wing is orange with a dark brown border around it. The underside of the wings is bright orange. The bottom wing's veins are a whitish color. Its wingspan (length of the wings) is ¾ to 1 inch.

Males find females by looking for them in tall grasses. Females lay their eggs one at a time on the caterpillar's host plant (the plant that the caterpillar feeds on). The eggs are pale yellow. The caterpillar makes a nest of grass and silk. The caterpillar is green. It has four pairs of white wax glands on the abdomen near the underside. The head is brown or tan. It is usually darker in the center. The collar (the area between where the head and the body connect) has a white stripe and a black stripe. The chrysalis is a cream color and has brown markings. The caterpillar will hibernate in the winter. The least skipper has 2-4 broods each year.

Here is a list of host plants that the least skipper caterpillar feeds on:


There are some species of butterflies that are similar to the least skipper. They are the European skipper ("Thymelicus lineola"), the tropical least skipper ("Ancyloxypha arene"), the orange skipperling ("Copaeodes aurantiaeca"), and the southern skipperling ("Copaeodes minima").

Factor VIII

Factor VIII (FVIII) is a blood clotting factor that is also called anti-hemophilic factor (AHF). In humans, Factor VII is in the F8 gene. If there is something wrong with this gene, you get hemophilia A, which is a recessive disorder. The gene for Factor VIII is on the X chromosome.

X chromosome

The X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes in mammals. They decide the sex (gender) of an individual. The other sex chromosome is the Y chromosome.

Females have two X chromosomes, males have one X and one Y. An egg always carries a single X, while sperms carry either an X or a Y. That is how sex is determined in humans, and in most other mammals. Although females have two X chromosomes, each cell can only have one X chromosome active. During early development, a process called X-inactivation occurs. In each cell one of the X chromosomes randomly deactivates. This causes different parts of the body to have different X-linked genes, and is responsible for the black and orange coloration of calico cats.


Chance

Chance is a word that refers to:


1987 Edmonton tornado

The Edmonton tornado was a powerful and devastating tornado that hit the eastern part of Edmonton, Alberta on the afternoon of July 31, 1987. It destroyed more than 300 homes.

Vale of White Horse

The Vale of White Horse is a local government district of Oxfordshire in England. The main town is Abingdon, other places are Faringdon and Wantage. There are 68 parishes within the district.

It is a region between the Berkshire Downs and the River Thames. It was named after the prehistoric Uffington White Horse. The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972. The area is often referred to as the ‘Vale of the White Horse’.

It is the valley of the Ock, a stream which joins the Thames from the West at Abingdon. The Vale is almost flat and well-wooded. Following local usage the vale covers all the ground between the Cotswolds (on the north) and the White Horse Hills. According to the geographical definition, however, the Vale is from two to five miles wide, and the distance by road from Abingdon to Shrivenham at its head is 18 miles.

The highest hill of the district is White Horse Hill that is 261 m (856 ft) high. In its northern flank, just below the summit, a gigantic figure of a horse is cut, the turf is removed to show the white chalky soil beneath. This figure gives name to the hill, the range and the vale. It is 114 m (374 ft) long, the neck, body and tail varying little in width.


Slipper

A slipper is a light shoe worn indoors. They keep feet warm. People also wear them to keep their feet or socks clean. They are usually made of a something comfortable like a towel material or thin leather. They come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. 
The recorded history of slippers can be traced back to the 12th century. In the West, the record can only be traced to 1478.
Slippers in China date from 4700 BCE. They were made of cotton or woven rush, had leather linings, and featured symbols of power, such as dragons.

Native American moccasins were also highly decorative. Such moccasins showed nature scenes and were decorated with beadwork and fringing, their soft sure-footedness made them good for indoors taking (or setting aside). Inuit and Aleut people made shoes from smoked hare-hide to protect their feet against the frozen ground inside their homes.

Beautiful Orientalism saw the introduction into the West of designs like the baboosh.

Victorian people needed such shoes to keep the dust and gravel outside their homes. For Victorian ladies, slippers gave an opportunity to show off their needlepoint skills and use embroidery as decoration.
Types of slippers include:
Some slippers are made to look like something other than a slipper and are sold as a novelty item. The slippers are usually made from soft and colorful materials and may come in the shapes of animals, animal paws, vehicles, cartoon characters, etc.

Not all shoes with a soft fluffy interior are slippers. Any shoe with a rubber only and laces is a normal outdoor shoe. In India, rubber chappals (flip-flops) are worn as indoor shoes.

Luxembourg (Belgium)

Luxembourg (, , , , ) is the southernmost province of Belgium and Wallonia. 

The capital is Arlon, in the southeast of the province. The province is also called "Belgian Luxembourg" and should not be confused with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

It borders on (clockwise starting from the east) the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, France in the south, and the Belgian provinces of Namur in the west and Liège in the north. Neither Luxembourg nor neighboring Namur border Flanders.

It has the smallest population of all the Belgian provinces, about 291,000 in 2022. With , it is the largest province of Belgium. It is also significantly larger and significantly less populous than the neighbouring Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

The main natural regions in the province are Belgian Lorraine in the southern part, the Ardennes in the centre and northern part, and the Famenne and Condroz in the very northwestern part of the province.

With , the Baraque de Fraiture in the municipality of Vielsalm is the highest point of the province. Second is the Galata with in the municipality of Saint-Hubert.

The main rivers in the province of Luxembourg are:

The province was separated from the neighbouring Luxembourg by the Third Partition of Luxembourg in 1839, after the Belgian Revolution, and declared to remain a part of Belgium.

During World War I, Luxembourg was occupied by the German Empire.

The Battle of the Bulge, a German counter-attack against the Allied offensive in the Ardennes in the winter of 1944/45, took also place in the province of Luxembourg.

Most of the residents of Luxembourg speak French, but there is a small Luxembourgish-speaking minority, in Arelerland (the eastern part of Belgian Lorraine: Arlon and surroundings), near the border with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in the southeast.

The dialect of Luxembourg (although slightly spoken) is Walloon. In the western part of Belgian Lorraine people speak Gaumais (the region is called the Gaume). Both are Romance languages.

The province of Luxembourg is divided into 5 "arrondissements" and a total of 44 municipalities.

Population x 1,000 (on 1 January since 1980).


Bus

A bus (contracted from omnibus, with variants multibus, motorbus, autobus, etc.) is a road vehicle that carries significantly more passengers than an average car or passenger van, but less than the average rail transport. It is most commonly used in public transport, Unlike trams or rapid transit trains, but is also in use for charter purposes, or through private ownership. Although the average bus carries between 30 and 100 passengers, some buses have a capacity of up to 300 passengers. The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus, with double-decker and articulated buses carrying larger loads, and midibuses and minibuses carrying smaller loads. Coaches are used for longer-distance services. Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare. Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus, are free. In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special large vehicle licence above and beyond a regular driving licence.

Buses are an important part of public transport in places all over the world. Many people who do not have cars, especially the third world countries, use buses to get around. Buses make it easy for them to get to where they want to go.

Buses can have many types of bus. For example : The double decker bus.

A place where people wait for a local bus is called a "bus stop". A building where people wait for a long-distance bus or where many buses meet is called a "bus station".

There are many types of bus around the world. An example is a motorhome, which is a bus-like vehicle equipped for living. Typically, a motorhome will include a lounge area, dining area, small bathroom, a galley, kitchen and a corridor.

Life vest

A life vest (also called Personal flotation device, lifejacket, or cork jacket) is a special type of clothing. The vest makes people float in water. It also keeps their head out of the water so that they can breathe. There are different categories of life vests. They are mainly different in how much flotation they provide. Some life vests inflate all by themselves, others need to be filled with air manually.

A life vest has one very important property: The part of keeping the head outside the water works even if the persion is unconscious, or unable to do anything. A swimming aid will simply help the person in the water, and make swimming easier. It will not work on its own.

People doing watersports, for example sailing, usually wear life vests.

There are two broad categories of life vests: 


Life vests are also classified by the minimum and maximum supported weight, which is usually printed on the vest. For this reason, there are special life vests for children. Also note, that the simplest types of life vest usually do not support the person wearing it becoming unconscious (and still guarantee that the person is in the right position, and the head is outside the water). 

To be safe even for unconscious people, these vests must bring the wearers to lie on their back. For adults, this means that they must have a flotation of at least 230 Newton. Note that even with such vests, this can usually not be guaranteed: The wrong angle of hiting the water surface, or the position of arms and legs can prevent it. 

Pocket watch

A pocket watch is a timepiece that is kept in the pocket rather than worn on a wrist (wristwatch). It is thought to be invented by Peter Henlein.

The pocket watch usually has a chain to connect to a certain clothing, so the watch would not fall out of the pocket and get broken. This watch was popular before the wristwatch become popular. Because of wristwatches, the pocket watch became less common and popular. Still, some people today wear pocket watches, and a golden pocket watch is often a token of a person's retirement.

Ouanaminthe

Ouanaminthe (Kréyòl: "Wanament") is a city in northeast Haiti. It is the most important city of the Nord-Est "Département". In Spanish, the city is called sometimes "Juana Méndez".

The city is part of an "arrondissement" (a part of a department) with the same name, along the northern border with the Dominican Republic. The Dajabón River is between Ouanaminthe and the Dominican city of Dajabón. The border crossing to Dajabón is one of the four chief land crossings from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and Haitians living in Ouanaminthe are allowed to cross the border to Dajabón only two days per week.


Developing country

Different people have tried to classify countries into different groups. This is usually done either by looking at how rich people are, on average, in different countries. Most of the time there are two groups, namely developing countries and developed ones. Sometimes there are three groups, in which case the third group is between developing and developed countries, and is usually called emerging countries.

These definitions are problematic, because a high standard of living does not just mean that people make a lot of money. The main problem is that things cost different amounts in different countries. Just because people earn more money in one country does not necessarily mean they are better-off; they might earn more simply because the cost of living is higher. This means they need to spend more money just to buy those things they need every day.

For this reason, there are different definitions of developing countries. The level of economic development also changes a lot from one developing countries to another. There are developing countries that have a high standard of living.

Many of these countries have a lot of natural resources but not the Industrialization that would use them, so the resources are sold to the countries which can use them.

There have been many other names used to describe these countries, including:


Malden Island

Malden Island is an island in the Pacific Ocean. Today, the island belongs to Kiribati. It is one of the Line Islands. In the 19th century the island used to be called Independence Island at times. The island is uninhabited today, it has been made into a nature reserve for breeding seabirds.

Malden Island is located 242 nautical miles (nmi) south of the equator, 150 nmi south of Honolulu, Hawaii. The coast of South America is more than 4,000 nautical miles (5,000 statute miles or 8,000 km) to the east.

The nearest land is uninhabited Starbuck Island, 110 nmi to the southwest. The closest inhabited place is Tongareva (Penrhyn Island),243 nmi to the southwest. The nearest airport is on Kiritimati (Christmas Island), 365 nmi to the northwest. There are other uninhabited islands nearby. They include Jarvis Island, 373 nmi to the northwest, Vostok Island, 385 nmi to the south-southeast, and Caroline (Millennium) Island, 460 nmi to the southeast.

The island has roughly the shape of an equilateral triangle, with on a side, aligned with the southwest side running northwest to southeast. The west and south corners are slightly truncated, shortening the north, east and southwest coasts to about , and adding shorter west and south coasts about 1 to 2 km (–1 mi) in length. 

There is a large lagoon with many small islets in the east-central part of the island. The lagoon is completely sourrounded by land. It is connected to the sea by underground channels, and is quite salty. Most of the land area of the island lies to the south and west of the lagoon. The total area of the island is about 39.2 square kilometers. 

The island is very low, no more than above sea level at its highest point. The highest elevations are found along a rim that closely follows the coastline. The inside forms a depression that is only a few meters above sea level in the western part and is below sea level (filled by the lagoon) in the east central part. Because of this topography, the ocean cannot be seen from much of Malden's interior.

There is no standing fresh water on Malden Island, though a fresh water lens may exist.

A continuous heavy surf falls all along the coast, forming a narrow white to gray sandy beach. On the west coast, the white sandy beach is bigger. On the rest of the coast there is a strip of dark gray coral rubble, forming a ridge. This makes the beach itself smaller.

George Anson Byron, a British captain, discovered Malden Island on 30 July 1824. He named it after Charles Robert Malden who was the first to land on the island. At the time of its discovery, the island was uninhabited, but there were ruins. Archeologists discovered that the island was inhabited by between 100 and 200 Polynesians, a few centuries earlier. 

The ancient stone structures are located around the beach ridges. Most of them are on the north and south sides. Overall, twenty-one sites are known. Three of them are larger than the others. They can be found on the northwest side of the island. The sites are either temples, houses or graves. The temple ruins are referred to as marae. Similar marae have also been found on other islands, such as Raivavae, one of the Austral Islands.

The inhabitants had also made wells, but later settlers found them to be dry, or too salty.

In 1828, guano was discovered on the island. In 1856, the United States wanted to get the Island, but Australian firms had already started to mine the guano deposits. Guano mining stopped about 1927. In 1956 and 1957, Great Britain tested H-bombs on the island. The tests were called Operation Grapple.

York Minster

York Minster is the largest Gothic cathedral in Northern Europe. The title "Minster" is given to churches which in the Anglo-Saxon period were missionary teaching churches. 

York Minster is in the city of York, North Yorkshire, England. It is the 'seat' of the Archbishop of York, the second-highest-ranking bishop in the Church of England. The Minster is run by a Chapter (committee) under the Dean of York, who manages the affairs of the Minster. The current archbishop (since 2005) is Dr. John Sentamu. 

The architecture of the Minster is English Gothic architecture, from Early English in 1270 to Perpendicular in 1472. The Minster has a wide, Decorated Gothic nave (where the congregation sits) and Chapter house. The choir (spelled 'quire' by the church) is slightly later English Gothic architecture. The east end, and north and south transepts are in a similar style. The nave contains the West Window, constructed in 1338. 

Some of the stained glass in York Minster dates back to the twelfth century. Over the Lady Chapel in the east end is the Great East Window (finished in 1408), one of the largest areas of mediaeval stained glass in the world. The window is known to be the work of John Thornton of Coventry a master glazier and stained glass artist who was active in England during the first half of the 15th century. 

In the north transept is the Five Sisters Window, each narrow window being over high. The south transept contains the famous Rose window. About 2 million individual pieces of glass make up the cathedral's 128 stained glass windows. Much of the glass was removed before and pieced back together after the First and Second World Wars, and the windows are constantly being cleaned and restored to keep their beauty intact.

A total of seven clock bells, 14 change ringing bells and 22 carillon bells are lodged in the towers. The carillon bells are played on a baton keyboard in the ringing chamber. The largest bell is Great Peter, which strikes the hour. It weighs 10.8 tons.

York has had a Christian presence from the 300s. The first church on the site was a wooden structure built hurriedly in 627 to provide a place to baptise Edwin, King of Northumbria. A stone building was completed in 637, and was dedicated to Saint Peter. Its school and library were started in the 7th century.

In 741 the church was destroyed in a fire. It was rebuilt as a bigger building, with thirty altars. The church and the entire area then passed through the hands of Norse invaders. The Benedictine archbishop Ealdred travelled to Westminster to crown William in 1066. Ealdred died in 1069 and was buried in the church.

The church was damaged in 1069, but the first Norman archbishop, arriving in 1070, organised repairs. The Danes destroyed the church in 1075, but it was again rebuilt from 1080. Built in the Norman style, it was 111 m (364.173 ft) long. The new structure was damaged by fire in 1137 but was soon repaired. The choir and crypt were remodelled in 1154, and a new chapel was built, all in the Norman style.

The Gothic style in cathedrals had arrived in the mid 12th century. Walter de Gray was made archbishop in 1215 and ordered the construction of a Gothic structure to compare with Canterbury; building began in 1220. The cathedral was declared complete and consecrated in 1472.

The English Reformation led to the first Anglican archbishop. Some of the cathedral's treasures were taken by the Crown, and the church lost some of its land. Under Elizabeth I there was an effort to remove all traces of the Roman Catholic Church from the cathedral; there was much destruction of tombs, windows, and altars. In the English Civil War the city was besieged and fell to the forces of Cromwell in 1644, but Thomas Fairfax prevented any further damage to the cathedral.

Ambush

An ambush, or a surprise attack, is a long-established military tactic. It is a surprise attack from a hidden position against an enemy. The enemy may be moving or have stopped. An ambush uses the element of surprise to confuse the enemy soldiers long enough to be successful. 

Unlike other surprise attacks, the point of an ambush is not to gain territory. Instead, it may be used to harass an enemy. It may also be used to or key assets (people, equipment, supplies, etc.).

One of the earliest recorded use of the ambush was in 9 AD in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. The Germanic leader Arminius ambushed three Roman legions thaï were under the command of Varus. The 20,000 Roman soldiers were strung out in a long line of march through the densely-wooded forest. The Romans fought for days but in the end were completely destroyed.

Grape shot is a canvas bag packed with small metal balls ("grapes"). This is protected from the gunpowder charge by metal wadding. As the name suggests, the balls fly through the air in a cluster, shot by a gun or a cannon. Grapeshot was much used until it became obsolete during the 19th century. These days it would be called an "antipersonnel weapon".

An artillery shell is a hollow ball packed with explosive and a fuse. The fuse is lit by the explosive charge that sends the shell towards its target. It is designed to explode when it reaches its target. Grape shot does not wait. It begins to spread as soon as it leaves the gun or cannon. Grape shot is quite different from a shell or shrapnel rounds.

Shrapnel, while similar to both, is different and more deadly. Invented by a British officer during the Napoleonic Wars, it is a fused explosive shell filled with many small balls or iron/lead bits. When the shell bursts the small bits scatter in a more or less spherical pattern with usually fatal force. 

All three of these rounds, grape shot, shell, and shrapnel, are extremely effective against troops, horses and other livestock. They can also destroy wooden structures. Shells have historically been effective as incendiaries against wooden targets, which they ignite from the heat of their explosive blast. Grape shot sends out mini-missiles across a wide pattern. This is best for human targets, but it may be damaging against nearby wooden structures.

Banzai charge

A Banzai charge (or ""banzai" attack") (萬歳突撃) was a tactic used by Japanese soldiers against the American soldiers when they were losing World War II. Banzai charges were usually suicide charges. This was so they would have an honourable death without surrender. Also, the charges were a final attempt to gain success against the Allied forces, which usually had more troops.

Paratrooper

Paratroopers are soldiers trained in parachuting and generally operate as part of an airborne force. Using paratroopers is called "paradrop operations".

The idea of dropping soldiers from height dates back to Benjamin Franklin whose idea was to drop soldiers with parachutes from balloons. The idea was not very practical, but the development of aeroplanes in World War I meant that it was feasible (that is: a working idea) to drop soldiers with parachutes from air.

Italy was the first country which founded airborne forces in the 1930s. Germany and Soviet Union soon followed. Germany was the first country to use paratroopers, called "Fallschirmjäger" (German language for "parachute ranger") in combat in World War Two. Germany dropped paratroops in Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Norway in 1940. United Kingdom founded its own airborne forces in 1941. The first British paradrop operation was a guerrilla strike against an important water line in Italy. In 1941, the Germans launched a massive paradrop operation in Crete, capturing the island from the British. The British troops had fought back so bitterly and caused so heavy casualties (that is: dead and wounded) to the German paratroopers that Adolf Hitler forbade any further paradrop operations.

When United States joined the war, it founded its own airborne forces. Americans made paradrops in North Africa, Sicily, Italy, France and Germany itself. The first really large paradrop operation was the Normandy invasion, called "Operation Overlord" 6.6. 1944 where the British dropped one and Americans dropped two divisions of paratroopers in Normandy, France to capture important bridges and traffic junctions.

The largest paradrop operation ever was Operation Market Garden in September 1944, which led into liberation of Belgium and capture of important ports at Rhine mouth. The last paradrop operation in World War Two was Operation Varsity, which was used to secure the bridgeheads at River Rhine and to open roads to Germany itself.

The development of helicopter meant that troops could now be carried and landed quickly on the spot and there was no more need for large scale paradrop operations. The last large paradrop has been during the Suez Crisis 1951 when the British dropped a battalion of paratroops at Suez.

Paratroops are elite troops in all armies around the world. They work as light infantry, and receive an extremely hard and good training. They are taught to run, fight, carry weapons, move and survive in very difficult terrain and conditions. All paratroopers are always volunteers. To become a paratrooper, a soldier must be very fit, very intelligent, have a very good discipline and have enough courage to jump off an aeroplane.

Paratroopers are mainly used as rangers in modern warfare. A ranger is a soldier who is employed very far from home base, often behind enemy lines. Their main task is to capture important bridges, buildings, villages and other sites, do guerrilla strikes like blowing up an enemy railway line, capture enemy leaders and important soldiers and do long range reconnaissance (that is: scouting and gathering information of enemy troops, movements etc).

Many paratrooper units have their own names, such as British "Red Devils", American "Screaming Eagles" and "All American" and German "Green Devils".

Paratroopers are dropped off at a place where they are meant to operate. This is called a "drop zone" (DZ). Paratroopers usually jump from heights of 100 to 400 m. They usually use round "bell" parachutes and they use static line deployment. (See the article Parachute on how the static line works.) They usually carry pistols and rifles with them, and their other weapons and gear are dropped on containers at the same time.

Once the paratroopers have landed, they take off their parachute rigs and gather to designated places. Their leaders then assign them orders. For example they may capture a bridge so their troops can use it, or destroy it with explosives so the enemy cannot use it. 

Paratroopers usually fight as light infantry. They usually have few heavy weapons, and no tanks or heavy artillery. Once the paratroopers have carried out their mission, they usually wait for their ground troops to arrive and take control. They may continue to fight on the ground, or may return to base and prepare for the next drop.

Paratroopers are currently not used, due to advancement in AA (anti-aircraft) guns. While paratroopers aren't used, paratroopers are still hired and trained.

Pikachu

Pikachu is a yellow mouse Pokémon from the fictional Pokémon world that was created by Satoshi Tajiri. Pikachu is the mascot of the Pokémon franchise, and one of the main characters of the Pokémon anime series. It has also appeared in most Pokémon video games and merchandise. In the video game "Pokémon Yellow", it is the player's starter Pokémon. In the anime series, Pikachu is Ash's first Pokémon.

Pikachu is an electric-type Pokémon, which attacks using electricity from two red pouches on its cheeks.

Pikachu evolves from a baby Pokémon called Pichu if it loves its trainer. Pikachu can evolve into Raichu, which is darker orange than Pikachu, if a Pikachu evolves in Alola the Raichu it evolves into has the ability to fly and use its tail kind of like a hoverboard.

Pikachu is a yellow mouse Pokémon. It has long ears with black tips. It has red cheeks that store electricity. It has brown stripes on its back. Pikachu has a lightning bolt-shaped tail, while female Pikachus have a heart-shape at the end of their tails.

Pikachu is 40 centimeters (1 foot, 4 inches) tall and it weighs 6 kilograms (14 pounds).

The name "Pikachu" comes from the Japanese words "pikapika" (the sound of electricity) and "chuchu" (the sound that a mouse makes).

In the "Pokémon" anime, the trainer Ash Ketchum's first Pokémon is a Pikachu. At first, it does not like him, but then he saves it from a group of Spearow and their friendship grows slowly from there.

Pikachu has also appeared in the "Super Smash Bros." series. He has appeared in "Super Smash Bros.", "Super Smash Bros. Melee", "Super Smash Bros. Brawl", "Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U", and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a very fast and light playable character. In the game Pokémon Go, Pikachu can be found wearing a Santa hat at Christmas.

Ryan Reynolds voiced Pikachu in the 2019 movie "".

Pichu is the pre-evolved form of Pikachu. It is a small yellow electric mouse, but is not as powerful as Pikachu. It evolves to Pikachu when it is very happy, such as loving its trainer. There are special forms of Pichu: a notched-ear Pichu, and a Pikachu-colored Pichu as event Pokémon in the "Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver" games. Pichu has appeared as an unlockable character in "Super Smash Bros. Melee" and "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate" where it has a cloned moveset to Pikachu's but takes damage when it uses electric attacks. Pichu features in the intro of the third Pokémon movie.

In the anime episode "Enter Pikachu", Ash's Pikachu was born as a Pichu and was raised by Kangaskhan (a Pokémon that looks like a kangaroo). After he became too big for Kangaskhan to raise, Pichu ran away and evolved into Pikachu.

Raichu is the evolved form of Pikachu and has orange fur, unlike Pikachu's yellow fur. In order for a Pikachu to evolve into a Raichu, it must use a Thunderstone. It can hold much more electricity in its cheeks. In Alola, it can evolve into Alolan Raichu by using a Thunderstone in Alola. It is a Psychic/Electric type. In the Pokémon anime, in Kanto, Gym Leader Lt. Surge's Raichu has a battle with Ash's Pikachu. At first, Raichu wins, but Pikachu beats it in a rematch.

Cypress Gardens

Cypress Gardens is a theme park near Winter Haven, Florida in the United States.

Cypress Gardens opened on January 2, 1936 as a flower garden planted by Dick and Julie Pope. Over the years, it became one of the biggest attractions in Florida, known for its water ski shows, nice gardens, and Southern Belle models.

It became known as the "Water Ski Capital of the World" because many of the sport's major "firsts" and over 50 world records were broken there. Many movies have been filmed at the park, including parts of "This is Cinerama," the first feature filmed in that wide-screen format, and several of Esther Williams films and TV specials in the 1950s and 1960s. With their addition of a custom photography boat named Miss Cover Girl in the early 1960s, the park became a popular site for the filming of television commercials.

Competition for guests increased after the Walt Disney World Resort opened nearby in 1971. In the early 1980s, the Popes retired and gave the park to their son, Dick Pope Jr.

In the 1980s, book publisher Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich bought the park along with SeaWorld, Circus World (later rebuilt as Boardwalk & Baseball) and Stars Hall of Fame, but sold most of the businesses to Anheuser-Busch in 1989. Busch continued to run Cypress Gardens until April 1, 1995, when a group of the park's managers led by Bill Reynolds bought the property.

Under President and CEO Reynolds, the park ran until April 13, 2003, when it closed after a long tourism decline following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. 529 people were put out of work with only three days notice. 

Right away the Friends of Cypress Gardens, started and led by Burma Davis Posey, was founded. They enrolled members in all 50 states and 27 countries. Within three and a half months, this grass-roots effort raised $13,500,000 and saved the park.

On February 22, 2004, Adventure Parks Group, owned by Kent Buescher, bought the property and renamed it Cypress Gardens Adventure Park. The purchase of the amusement park portion of the Cypress Gardens property was part of a larger conservation agreement. In that agreement, the entire site was bought from its previous owner, First Gardens, L.C., by The Trust for Public Land, a nation wide conservation group . TPL then sold a conservation access over the entire property to the state of Florida, while Polk County purchased the gardens portion of the property, less the development rights conveyed in the state agreement. Adventure Parks Group purchased the balance of the property, also subject to the conservation agreement.

Buescher's plan to reopen the park in September 2004 was delayed by damages created by hurricanes Charley, Frances, and Jeanne. Cypress Gardens Adventure Park finally opened in November 2004. One of its new rides, the Triple Hurricane roller coaster, was named for the fierce storm season. The Splash Island water park opened in 2005, along with the Galaxy Spin roller coaster.

In September 2006, Adventure Parks Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the Florida site following approximately $30 million in damages sustained by the 2004 hurricanes.

Land South Adventures, a branch of Mulberry, Florida-based Land South Holdings, bought Cypress Gardens at a bankruptcy auction on October 16, 2007 for $16.9 million, leaving Buescher as temporary manager until Baker Leisure Group of Orlando, Florida took over running the park in January 2008.

Many celebrities have skied and visited at the park, including Elvis Presley, Jordan's former King Hussein and his son, King Abdullah II. It was also the site of a Johnny Carson special.

On Monday, November 10, 2008, Land South Holdings announced the temporary closure of the park, which was shut down November 17 of that year. It reopened on March 28, 2009 with an expanded water park, named Splash Island. The rides and animals, however, were gone. The reopening prices were reduced. Cypress Gardens and Splash Island now have separate ticketing, though seasonal passes are available. Parking is now free.

Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion

The Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion is a musical composition by the Hungarian composer Béla Bartók. It was written for a very unusual combination of players. Four players are needed to perform this sonata: two pianists and two percussion players. The two pianists each have a piano, and the two percussion players play seven instruments between them: three timpani, xylophone, one side drum with snares and one without, a suspended cymbal, a pair of cymbals, a bass drum, a triangle and a tam-tam.

In the introduction to the score Bartók gave very precise instructions about how the different percussion instruments should be played, the kinds of beaters to be used, and a plan of how they were to be grouped on stage.

There are three movements: a fast movement, a slow movement and a fast movement. The first movement starts with a slow introduction.

There are many interesting and unusual things to listen out for in the music. For example, in the first movement the timpani sometimes play glissandos. This means that the pitch of the notes slides up or down. The player needs to have timpani with pedals to do this. This movement is in sonata form.

The second movement sounds very creepy. Bartók quite often wrote music which sounded like insects at night. This is one of his “night pieces”. In the climax to this exciting music Piano One plays lots of glissandos.

The last movement is a big contrast to the atmosphere in the slow movement. It is like a lively dance.

The sonata was first performed in Basle in 1938 with the composer playing one piano and his wife Ditta playing the other one. Fritz Schiesser and Philipp Rühlig played the percussion. It immediately became very popular and has since been one of his best- known works. Bartók also made a version for the two pianos to play with an orchestra, but it is not normally performed like that.


Concerto for Orchestra (Bartók)

Concerto for Orchestra is the title of a work for orchestra by the Hungarian composer Béla Bartók. It is one of the most famous orchestral pieces of the mid-20th century.

Several composers have written works to which they gave the title “Concerto for Orchestra”. It is an unusual title because a concerto is normally a work for one solo instrument and an orchestra. The soloist is given a lot of opportunity to show off his (or her) talent. In a “Concerto for Orchestra” there is no soloist, but the composer thinks it is different from a symphony because a lot of the instruments in the orchestra are treated like soloists during the piece. This is what happens in Béla Bartók’s concerto.

The work was written in 1943 and it was first performed on 1 December 1944 in the Boston Symphony Hall by the Boston Symphony Orchestra with the conductor Serge Koussevitzky. It was immediately a great success. Koussevitszky asked Bartók to write this piece. Bartók had just arrived in United States from Hungary. He had to flee because of World War II. Bartók had no money and so he was glad to get some work.

Bartók often uses ideas from the Classical music period in this work. He also uses ideas from folk music from central Europe, especially Hungarian music. Quite often the music is not in a major or minor key. He uses folk scales which have different kinds of scales called modes. Sometimes tunes sound like folk music. At other times there are drones in the horns and strings.

The orchestra needs 3 flutes (one doubling piccolo), 3 oboes (one doubling cor anglais), 3 clarinets (one doubling bass clarinet), 3 bassoons (one doubling contrabassoon), 4 French horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, side drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, tamtam, 2 harps and strings

The first movement, called "Introduzione" by Bartók, is a slow introduction which sounds like music describing the night. This is something Bartók did several times in his works. It is in sonata form.

The second movement is called "Giuoco delle coppie" which means "Game of pairs". Pairs of instruments take it in turns to play a tune, each pair playing music which is separated by a different interval.

The third movement, called "Elegia" by Bartók, is another slow movement, typical of Bartók's night music.

The fourth movement, called "Intermezzo interrotto" by Bartók, has a flowing melody with a time signature which keeps changing. There is also a theme which pokes fun at the march tune in Dmitri Shostakovich's ""Leningrad" Symphony (No. 7)". There is a very difficult bit for the timpani where the player has to play lots of different pitches in a very short section.

The fifth movement, called "Finale" is a very fast movement with lots of energy and plenty of folk tunes.


Bluebird K7

Bluebird K7 was a boat built for Donald Campbell to break the World Water Speed Record. Bluebird was a special kind of boat, called a hydroplane, that skims over the top of the water instead of pushing through it like a normal boat. Bluebird was powered by a jet engine. It set new world water speed records seven times; the fastest was 276 mph (445 km/h). Bluebird was destroyed when Campbell tried to set an eighth record by going faster than 300 mph (480 km/h) on Coniston Water in 1967.

Campbell had been using his father's boat, Bluebird K4, to try and set new records. Bluebird K4 was destroyed when its structure broke. After this, Donald had the idea for a jet powered hydroplane to take the world water speed record from the American propeller hydroplane Slo-mo-shun. Ken and Lewis Norris designed and built K7 based on Donald's ideas.

K7 was a three-point hydroplane, meaning that when going quickly the boat only touched the water in three places, one point near the back of the boat and one point at the back of the two sponsons (the sponsons are the floats either side of the boat, near its front in the photos). It was built of aluminium on top of a steel frame and was at first powered by a small turbojet.

The name K7 came from the rating given to the boat by Lloyds of London

Campbell set seven world water speed records in K7 between 1955 and 1964:


In 1966, Campbell decided he wanted to make Bluebird go faster than 300 mph (480 km/h).

Bluebird's old engine was not strong enough to make it go this fast, so it was replaced with a more powerful Bristol Siddeley Orpheus engine taken from an old fighter jet. Many other changes were made, the tail fin from the fighter was attached to Bluebird's rear, the cover over the cockpit was changed to push through the air more easily, and the floats at the front were also changed. Bluebird was taken to Coniston Water to be tested in 1966. The tests did not go well, the weather was too bad to test the boat while moving, so it was tied down and tested without moving instead. When testing the engine it sucked in too much air and caused parts of the boat to break. The engine was broken when the broken parts were sucked into it. This meant that the entire engine had to be replaced.

At the end of November the weather was good enough for some test runs, but the speed was a lot lower than Bluebird's old records. The fuel pumps could not pump enough fuel to the engine so it could not run at full speed. The problem was fixed by fitting two fuel pumps instead of one.

On 4 January 1967, the problems had all been fixed, the weather was good and Campbell decided he wanted to try and break the speed record. For a world record to be official, a boat trying to set a record has to make two runs at full speed that are timed by people who are not part of the record breaking team. The official speed is the average speed of the two runs. On the first run Bluebird's speed was 297.6 mph (478.9 km/h) which was fast enough to be a new record, but not quite as fast as Campbell wanted to go. To set a record of more than 300 mph the second run would have to be 302.5 mph or faster.

The plan for the world record attempt was for Bluebird to stop at the far end of the lake and refuel from another boat that had been put there for that purpose. Taking time to refuel would also give the lake, which had been disturbed by the first run, time to settle down again. On the actual record attempt, Campbell decided not to refuel and instead started on his second run immediately. Why he did this is unknown.

At the start of the second run, Bluebird was going faster than 320 mph (510 km/h) and would have easily broken the 300 mph target, but as the boat travelled along the lake it started tramping (which means rocking from side to side). Bluebird hit a wave made on the lake from its own first run and the boat spun out of the water. When it hit the water again it broke into pieces and sank. Donald Campbell was killed in the crash. His teddy bear mascot was found floating in the lake later on but Campbell's body could not be found.

In 2001 a diver called Bill Smith led a salvage team which found Bluebird on the bottom of Coniston Water, and later lifted the wreck back to dry land. The wreck was taken apart carefully to keep it from rusting and is now being put back together again. There was a lot of damage caused in the crash but it can all be repaired. Bill Smith also got a new engine for Bluebird and hopes to return the boat to full working order.

Donald Campbell's body was also found in 2001. He was buried on 12th September 2001 in Coniston cemetery.

On Thursday 7 December 2006, Gina Campbell, Donald's daughter, formally gifted the recovered wreckage of Bluebird K7 to the Ruskin Museum in Coniston on behalf of the Campbell Family Heritage Trust. 
In agreement with the Campbell Family Heritage Trust and the museum, Bill Smith is to organise the restoration of the boat, which is now under way.[9] The intention is to rebuild K7 back to running order circa 4 January 1967. Gina Campbell commented: "I've decided to secure the future of Bluebird for the people of Coniston, the Ruskin Museum and the people of the world". 

TM 65 77

The Telamiina 65 77 (Track mine model 66, with detonator model 77) is a Finnish Army standard issue anti-tank mine. The mine is made of 9.5 kg (~21 lbs) of cast TNT. The mine is armed with a detonator that is set to explode when at least 100 kg (~220 lbs) of pressure is applied to it. The blast effect of the mine blows the track off of tanks and damages their driving wheel.

The mine is also known as the "Kuntonappi" ("Fitness pill") or the "Tellu" (female name, shortened form of Tellervo9).

Where Sleeplessness Is Rest from Nightmares

Where Sleeplessness Is Rest from Nightmares is the very first album by Chicago metalcore band Arma Angelus.

All music composed by Arma Angelus. All lyrics written by Pete Wentz.

Arma Angelus

Arma Angelus was a metalcore band from Chicago. The band started in 1998 and broke up in 2002. The members of the band were Peter Wentz (singer, now plays bass guitar in Fall Out Boy), Tim McIlrath (played bass guitar, now lead singer of Rise Against), Jay Jancetic (played guitar, now plays guitar for the Chicago band Holy Roman Empire), Daniel Binaei (played guitar), Adam Bishop (played guitar, now an English teacher at San Dieguito High School Academy in Encinitas, California), and Timothy Miller (played the drums).

After Tim quit to start a new band called Rise Against, he was replaced in 1999 by Christopher Gutierrez. Gutierrez is now a touring author and spoken word artist. He was replaced as the bass guitar player for one tour by Joseph Trohman (now plays guitar in the band Fall Out Boy). Trohman was not a good fit for the band in terms of knowing about the music style and in terms of stage presence. He was replaced mid-tour when the band flew Chris Gutierrez out to New York for the final half of their tour, including a stop at CBGB's. 

In the last Arma Angelus concert, Patrick Stump played drums, Pete Wentz sang, Joe Trohman played guitar along with Adam Bishop, and Christopher Gutierrez on bass.



51 Pegasi

51 Pegasi is a star that is like our Sun and can be found 15.4 parsecs (50.1 light-years) away from the Earth in the constellation Pegasus. It was the first Sun-like star, other than the Sun, found to have a planet orbiting it, this discovery was first made public in 1995.

The exoplanet's discovery was made public on October 6, 1995 by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz. The discovery was made using the radial velocity method at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, using a tool called the ELODIE spectrograph that is used to find planets that are outside our Solar System. 

The star itself has an apparent brightness of 5.49, and because of this it is able to be seen from the Earth with binoculars, or with the naked eye if it is dark outside. 51 Pegasi is a yellow dwarf star that is thought to be around 7.5 billion years old, which is somewhat older than our Sun. 51 Pegasi is also 4-6% more massive than our Sun with more metal content. However, it is running low on hydrogen. 

In 1996 astronomers Baliunas, Sokoloff, and Soon calculated that it takes 51 Pegasi b 37 days to orbit 51 Pegasi.

After the announcement, on October 12, 1995, more proof that this star did exist came from Dr. Geoffrey Marcy from San Francisco State University and Dr. R. Paul Butler from the University of California, Berkeley using the Hamilton Spectrograph at the Lick Observatory near San Jose in California.

51 Pegasi b is the first discovered planet of its parent star, 51 Pegasi. If any more are discovered they will be named 51 Pegasi c, 51 Pegasi d, and so on. The planet has been informally named Bellerophon. After its discovery, many teams proved its existence and continued to find out more about its properties, including the fact that it orbits very close to the star, has estimated temperatures around 1200 Celsius, and has a minimum mass about half that of Jupiter.


Gumbasia

Gumbasia is a very short movie made in 1953 by Art Clokey. "Gumbasia" was a clay animation movie. Clokey became famous for his two series "Gumby" and "Davey and Goliath" which also used clay animation.

Clokey made "Gumbasia" while he was studying at the University of Southern California and being taught by Slavko Vorkapich. It was Clokey's first clay animation movie and it was only 3 minutes and 45 seconds long. The movie showed moving lumps of clay set to music in a copy of Walt Disney's "Fantasia". Gumbasia was made in a style Vorkapich taught called Kinesthetic Film Principles. This style, which uses camera movements and stop-motion editing, is used in later Gumby movies. After watching "Gumbasia", movie producer Sam Engel decided to give Clokey money to make a 15 minute movie that became the first Gumby movie -- "Gumby Goes to the Moon".

Belmont, New Hampshire

Belmont is a small town in New Hampshire, United States.

This was to honor August Belmont. The townspeople hoped Mr. Belmont would provide financial support but he did not.

Joker (comics)

The Joker is a fictional character, a comic book supervillain published by DC Comics. He is an archenemy of Batman. The character's creator has been disputed between Jerry Robinson, Bill Finger, and Bob Kane, even though many believe Robinson created the character. The Joker first appeared in Batman #1 (Spring 1940).

Throughout his comic book appearances, the Joker is portrayed as a master criminal whose characterization has varied from that of a violent psychopath to a goofy trickster-thief. He is the archenemy of Batman, having been directly responsible for numerous tragedies in Batman's life, including the paralysis of Barbara Gordon and the death of Jason Todd, the second Robin.

Joker's creation was inspired by Conrad Veidt's role in the 1928 silent movie "The Man Who Laughs".

The Joker possesses no superhuman abilities, instead using his expertise in chemical engineering to develop poisonous or lethal concoctions and thematic weaponry, including razor-tipped playing cards, deadly joy buzzers, and acid-spraying lapel flowers. The Joker sometimes works with other Gotham City supervillains, such as the Penguin and Two-Face, and groups like the Injustice Gang and Injustice League, but these relationships often collapse due to the Joker's desire for unbridled chaos. The 1990s introduced a romantic interest for the Joker in his former psychiatrist, Harley Quinn, who becomes his villainous sidekick. Although his primary obsession is Batman, the Joker has also fought other heroes, including Superman and Wonder Woman.

Throughout the character's long history, there have been several different origin tales; they most commonly depict him as falling into a vat of chemical waste, which bleaches his skin and turns his hair green and his lips bright red, giving him the appearance of a clown.

The Joker has appeared in movies, TV series and video games; he was played by Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Jared Leto, Joaquin Phoenix and Barry Keoghan in movies. On animated shows/movies he is portrayed by Mark Hamill, Richard Epcar, Kevin Michael Richardson, Larry Storch, Jeff Bennett, and John DiMaggio.

Both Ledger and Phoenix won an Academy Award for their portrayal of the character, making the Joker the second character to have its actor win an Academy Award more than once.

70 Virginis

70 Virginis is a yellow dwarf star that is around 58 light-years away from the Earth in the constellation Virgo. 70 Virginis is not as big or hot as Earth's Sun.

In 1996, 70 Virginis was found to have an extrasolar planet in orbit around it. There is also a dust disc that orbits the star. The temperature of the disc is 156 K and it is about 3.4 AU from the star.


Rhyno

Terrance "Terry" Gerin (born October 7, 1975) is an American professional wrestler. He is currently signed to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and competes under the ring name Rhino.

He is also known for his time in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and the World Wrestling Federation/WWE.

During his time in ECW, he was a one-time ECW World Heavyweight Champion and a two-time and final ECW World Television Champion.

In WWE, he was a three-time Hardcore Champion, one-time WCW United States Champion, and a one-time and one half of the the first SmackDown Tag Team Champions with Heath Slater.

Outside of wrestling, Gerin has also been involved in politics. On August 2, 2016, Gerin won the Republican primary for Michigan's 15th District. He ran against Democrat Abdullah Hammoud and lost 21,739 votes to 13,452.

70 Virginis b

70 Virginis b is an extrasolar planet that is around 60 light-years away from the Earth in the constellation of Virgo. The finding of this planet was announced in 1996 by astronomers Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler. 70 Virginis was one of the first stars that was known to have planets orbiting it. When first announced, 70 Virginis b was thought to be inside its star's habitable zone, but proof was later found that the planet has an eccentric orbit, closer to its parent.

70 Virginis b is a Jupiter-type extrasolar planet that orbits around 70 Virginis every 116 days. It has 7.5 times the mass of Jupiter. Its surface gravity is thought to be about two to three times that of Jupiter's. At the time that it was found in January 1996, it was thought that the star was only 29 light years away from the Earth. This could explain why the star was less bright based on its apparent magnitude (measure of brightness). As a result, the planet's orbit was thought to be in the habitable zone and the planet was given the nickname "Goldilocks" (not too cold or too hot). The Hipparcos satellite later showed that the star was farther away from 70 Virginis and therefore its brightness was a result of the planet being too hot to be in the habitable zone.

Scholasticism

Scholasticism is a way of thinking and teaching knowledge. It was developed in the Middle Ages. It started when people wanted to bring together what is called "classical philosophy" with the teachings of 
Christian theology. Classical philosophy is the philosophy developed in Ancient Greece. 
Scholasticism is not a philosophy or a theology, but rather a way of teaching and learning. Scholasticism emphasises the use of dialectic. The main purpose of dialectic is to find an answer to a question, or to show that a contradiction can be resolved.

Scholasticism was started by people like Saint Ambrose and St. Augustine. They tried to use philosophy to help explain the doctrine and mysteries of the church. Ambrose and Augustine were among the first Church fathers who brought Christian ideas and Greek philosophy together.

The main figures of scholasticism were Peter Abelard, Albertus Magnus, Duns Scotus, William of Ockham, Bonaventure and, most importantly, Thomas Aquinas. Summa Theologica is an ambitious synthesis of Greek philosophy and Christian doctrine.

In the 13th century, the teachings of Aristotle were considered more important than those of Plato. Scholastic education was very much based on written texts, and with arguments for and against ideas in those texts. In this way it differed greatly from modern science, which is based on observations from nature. In Aristotle the scholastics chose someone who was himself quite an original investigator of the natural world. But the scholastics themselves dealt almost entirely with the world in manuscripts written in two ancient languages. One was in Latin, the language of the Vulgate Bible and the other was Ancient Greek. Greek opened the doors to the writings of the Greek philosophers in their own language, at least so far as their works survived. The motto of Boethius “As far as you are able, join faith to reason” reminds us that all scholastics were mediaeval Christians. Their main concern was to see how the Greek ideas could be fitted into their religious view of the world.


916 America

916 America is a minor planet that is orbiting the Sun in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter.

It was discovered on 7 August 1915 by the Soviet astronomer Grigory Nikolaevich Neujmin at Simeis, Ukraine. It was originally called 916I, but was renamed "916 America" on 24 February 1923 after the Council of Astronomers at Pulkovo Observatory decided to pay tribute to "the friendly relations of the astronomical observatories and astronomers". Another possible reason for the name was as a mark of thankfulness for the help given during the famine in Crimea by the American Relief Administration under President Herbert Hoover.

In 1986, believing that the asteroid was of S-type and that it had a diameter of 15 km, the length of 916 America's day was thought to be 38 hours. Observations by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite have since shown that it has a diameter of 33.2±1.3 km, with an absolute magnitude of 11.20 and an albedo (the extent to which it reflects light) of 0.053±0.004.

"Weird Al" Yankovic made a parody of the song called "Eat It". Fall Out Boy covered the song with John Mayer on their 2008 album "Folie à Deux".

Jackson made a demo version of the song at his house. Other people that made music helped him make it. The drum sounds for the song were made on a drum machine. The bass guitar sounds for the song were made using a bass guitar and a keyboard. This style of making bass guitar sounds was used in the main song. Jermaine Jackson has said the song was inspired by things that happened when the Jackson family lived in Gary, Indiana.

Jackson and Jones asked Eddie Van Halen, the main guitar player for Van Halen, to make a guitar solo for the song. Van Halen recorded the guitar solo for free. He said that he did it "as a favor". The rest of the band thought he should have asked for money, but he did not want to. Van Halen recorded the guitar solo after Jones and Jackson came to his house. Two versions of the guitar solo were made. In 2015, Van Halen said he also changed the song so that his solo was in the key of E.

Diomede Islands

The Diomede Islands are two islands in the Bering Strait, about halfway between mainland Alaska and Siberia. They are also called Gvozdev Islands in Russian. There are two islands, called "Big Diomede" and "Little Diomede" respectively. 

Little Diomede is also known as Krusenstern Island, but there are also other places with this name. The Eskimos who live there call it "Ignaluk". 

The other island, Big Diomede, is also known as Imaqliq, Inaliq, Nunarbuk or Ratmanov Island. 

Big Diomede belongs to Siberia, Little Diomede is part of Alaska.

The Chukchi Sea is to the north and the Bering Sea to the south of the islands. to the southeast is Fairway Rock, an islet which is usually not considered part of the Diomede Islands.

The islands are separated by an international border and the International Date Line which is approximately from each island. At the closest distance between Little Diomede and Big Diomede, the two islands are only about apart. 

People who live on Little Diomede Island do so in a small village called Diomede, on the west side of the island.

There are plans to build a connection between Siberia and Alaska, either as a bridge or a tunnel (Bering Strait bridge spanning the Bering Strait). In that case, the Diomede Islands would be a halfway point, as they are about the middle of the Bering Strait.

They are sometimes called Tomorrow Island (Big Diomede) and Yesterday Isle (Little Diomede) because the big island is 21 hours ahead of the small one (except when changing daylight saving time, done on different dates).

The people who lived on Big Diomede Island were moved to mainland Russia by the Soviet government. A small Russian military base is currently on the island. Little Diomede has an Inupiat population of 170, mostly in the City of Diomede. This village there has a school, and a local store. Some Eskimos there are famous for their ivory carving. Mail is delivered by helicopter, weather permitting.

Clay animation

Clay animation is one of many ways to make a stop motion animation. Each animated piece, either character or background, can be formed and reformed into different shapes. People making a clay animation usually use something soft, like Plasticine clay. 

Most animation is made the same way, whether it is cel animation or stop motion. Each frame, or still picture, is recorded on film or digital media and then played back quickly. When played back at a frame rate of more than 10–12 frames per second, the human mind sees the series of slightly changing, rapidly playing images as movement. To us it seems as if the object is moving by itself. This way of tricking the mind into seeing "movement" is the way that all moving images work, from zoetrope to movies to videogames. The way CGI animations are made is different from the frame by frame method.

In clay animation, each object is made in clay, usually around a wire skeleton called an armature. The object is put on the set (background) and a still picture (one frame of film) is taken. The object or character is then moved slightly by hand. Another picture is taken, and the object is moved slightly again. This is repeated over and over. To get the best results, special care is taken to make sure that each frame is the same as the one before. For example, the lighting has to be the same and the object has to be put back in exactly the right place. The only thing that should be different is the slight change the animator makes to the object.

Making a stop-motion animation using clay is hard work. Normal movies use 24 frames per second (frame/s). Animation usually uses "doubles" or "twos"; that is using two frames for each shot. This means that 12 changes are made for one second of movie. For a 30-minute movie, there would be about 21,600 stops to change the objects for the next frame. For a full-length (90-minute) movie, there would be about 64,800 stops. IF some of the parts were done with only a single, not double frame, there would be even more stops. Great care must be taken to make sure that the object is not moved by accident. For full-length movies, animators now use rubber silicone and resin-cast objects. One foam-rubber method has been called "Foamation" by Will Vinton.

Some famous clay animation movies have been made. Examples include:

The word "Claymation" is a registered trademark in the United States. It was registered by Will Vinton in 1978 to describe his clay animation films. The word is often used incorrectly to describe any clay animation movie.

Space Race

The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War enemies, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US), to achieve better spaceflight capability than the other. It had its origins in the intercontinental ballistic missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations following World War II. Both governments saw having better spaceflight technology as necessary for national security. The Space Race enabled the first launches of artificial satellites, uncrewed space probes to the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and ultimately to the Moon.

The competition began on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites during the "International Geophysical Year" (July 1, 1957 to December 31, 1958), by declaring they would also launch a satellite "in the near future". The Soviet Union achieved the first successful artificial satellite launch on October 4, 1957 of Sputnik 1, and sent the first human to space with the orbital flight of Yuri Gagarin on April 12, 1961. The USSR demonstrated an early lead in the race with these and other early firsts over the next few years, including flight durations measured in days instead of hours, the first multi-person crewed spaceflight, and the first spacewalk.

But the USSR lost its early lead after US president John F. Kennedy raised the stakes by setting a goal of "landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth". American spaceflight capability overtook that of the Soviets with flights up to two weeks long; two craft meeting in space (rendezvous) and joining (docking); astronauts working outside spacecraft; and using high-energy liquid hydrogen as rocket fuel in the Saturn family of rockets. Kennedy's Moon landing goal was achieved in July 1969, with the flight of Apollo 11, which sent and returned three men and landed two of them, a singular achievement far outweighing any combination of Soviet achievements. The USSR pursued two crewed lunar programs, but failed to develop a launch vehicle powerful enough to land one human on the Moon before the US, and eventually canceled them to concentrate on Earth orbital space stations, while the US landed five more Apollo crews on the Moon.

A period of détente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew and joint development of an international docking standard APAS-75. Apollo–Soyuz began a period of transition from the Space Race to an age of US / Russian space cooperation by December 1991, when the dissolution of the Soviet Union brought the end of the Cold War and enabled the Shuttle-Mir and International Space Station programs between the US and the newly founded Russian Federation.


Oligotroph

An oligotroph is an organism that can survive with relatively few nutrients. Because there are few nutrients, such organisms grow slower. Their metabolism usually runs at a slower rate. The population density is generally low. 

Environments where oligotrophs can be found include the deep oceans.

Supersaturation

Supersaturation in chemical solutions is when a solution contains more of a solute than can be dissolved in it. This usually makes some of the solute separate itself from the solution.



Dyspnea

Dyspnea or dyspnoea (said "disp-nee-ah") is shortness of breath. Some research says that about 27% of people suffer it. 

There are many different causes of dyspnea. Some include:



Epiglottitis

Epiglottitis is inflammation of the epiglottis, which is the flap that sits at the base of the tongue, which keeps food from going into the trachea (windpipe). Due to its place in the airway, swelling of this can interfere with breathing and can set up a medical emergency.

Epiglottitis usually happens in children. It can be accompanied with fever, problems swallowing, drooling, and stridor. In children, it must always be considered a medical emergency requiring urgent treatment in an emergency room at a hospital.

Lyme disease

Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is an infectious disease. It is caused by bacteria of the genus "Borrelia". The disease is carried by ticks which are parasitic on mammals such as mice, deer, and people. In other words, ticks are the vector which transmits the disease.

It is the most common tick-borne infection in the United States. Although Allen Steere realized in 1978 that Lyme disease was a tick-borne disease, the cause of the disease remained a mystery until 1982. It can cause joint swelling, rashes, and neurological symptoms.

Lyme disease is treated with antibiotics. Depending on disease stage and antibiotic used, treatment is usually between 10 and 28 days.


Travis Childers

Travis Wayne Childers (born March 29, 1958 in Booneville, Mississippi, United States) is an American politician. He represented Mississippi's 1st district in the U.S. House of Representatives from the May 2008 special election until 2011. 

Childers did not win re-election in on November 2, 2010, he was defeated by former state senator Alan Nunnelee.


Carbonated water

Carbonated water, also known as soda water, sparkling water, fizzy water, seltzer, and water with gas, is plain water into which carbon dioxide gas has been dissolved. Most soft drinks have carbonated water as a base. The process of dissolving carbon dioxide gas is called carbonation. It results in the formation of carbonic acid.

There are special machines that allow to make soda water at home.

The process of carbonation can also occur naturally to produce carbonated mineral water. Beer and wine are carbonated by fermentation.

Carbonated water was discovered by Joseph Pristly in 1767.

Eastern European Summer Time

Eastern European Summer Time (EEST) is one of the names of UTC+3 time zone. This zone is 3 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time. It is used as a summer daylight saving time in some European, North African, and Middle Eastern countries. During the winter, the Eastern European Time (UTC+2) is used.

The following countries and territories use Eastern European Summer Time during the summer:


In 1991 EEST was used also in Moscow and Samara time zones of Russia.

African Sanctus

African Sanctus is a musical composition for choir, soloists, orchestra and prerecorded tape by David Fanshawe. It was composed in 1972.

"African Sanctus" is the best-known of Fanshawe's works. It was composed after Fanshawe had made journeys to Africa up the river Nile between 1969 and 1973. The shape of his journey forms the shape of a cross. This had a religious meaning for Fanshawe. He made recordings on tape of the people he met singing their traditional music. A lot of this music had never been recorded before. When he returned home to Britain he composed the "African Sanctus". Some of the recordings he had made in Africa are played as part of the performance. The choir who sing live at the concert are singing some of the words of the traditional Christian Latin Mass.

The recordings are from Egypt, the Sudan, Uganda and Kenya.

At first it was called "African Revelations", but then the title was changed to "African Sanctus". It was first performed in London by the Saltarello Choir in July 1972, and was later played on BBC Radio on United Nations Day. A documentary film was made three years later showing how the work had been composed.


The work has been performed in many places in Britain and all round the world. Fanshawe comes to many of these concerts personally.

In 1994 David Fanshawe composed an extra movement for a new recording of the work, the Dona Nobis Pacem - A Hymn for World Peace, which completed the Agnus Dei. Based on this new recording, the BBC commissioned the maker of the 1975 documentary, Herbert Chappell, to make a new programme, "African Sanctus Revisited",



David Fanshawe

David Fanshawe (born 19 April 1942 in Devon, England; died 5 July 2010) was an English composer and explorer. He wrote a large amount of music, especially for television programmes. His best-known composition is a choral work called "African Sanctus".

Fanshawe went to school at St George's School, Windsor Castle and Stowe School. He started his career as a musician and producer for documentary films. He studied composition at the Royal College of Music. He became known for the music he wrote for films and TV. In 1970 he performed "Salaams" in the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London. This was a work based on the rhythms of pearl divers in Bahrain.

He spent several years travelling to many parts of the world collecting recordings of people singing their own traditional music. He travelled to the Middle East, then to Africa and to islands of the Pacific Ocean. In all these places he had to get to know the people and get them to trust him so that they would let him record their music.

His "African Sanctus" was a result of his trip down the Nile. It combines recordings he made there with a choir and orchestra singing. It has been performed thousands of times all over the world.

Fanshawe died on 5 July 2010.


Haley Barbour

Haley Reeves Barbour (born October 22, 1947) is an American politician. He was the governor of Mississippi from 2004 to 2012. He was mentioned as a possible candidate for President of the United States in the 2012. In April 2011, Barbour said he will not run for president.

Barbour was born in Yazoo City, Mississippi, where he was raised as the youngest of three sons of Grace LeFlore (née Johnson) and Jeptha Fowlkes Barbour, Jr. Haley's father, a lawyer, died when Barbour was two years old. Barbour's father who was a Circuit Judge had an inmate to assist him when Judge Barbour became ill. Leon Turner, who was given a posthumous pardon by Barbour in the closing days of his administration, had helped to raise him.

Moose Jaw is a city in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan; about 70 km west of the capital Regina.

Playpen

A playpen is where a baby plays in an enclosed structure. It is designed to keep the baby safe when the parent is not there. The earliest use of the word playpen in the Oxford English Dictionary was in 1902.

Playpens were once made of wood. They were square shaped, with vertical wooden bars on four sides, so that the child can see out. The floor of the playpen is usually a soft mat. The walls of the playpen are usually higher than the height of the child, so the child can not climb out.

Modern playpens can be moved easily. They are usually made of a basic metal and plastic support system with mesh, soft plastic or nylon sides. Sometimes a bassinet can be put on the top for the baby to sleep in, or be changed in, until four months of age. Some have mobiles, side pockets for supplies and toys, night lights, music boxes, or a CD player for the child to listen to music while sleeping or playing. Portable playpens come in different sizes, but most can be rolled or folded up for easy storage and transport.

It is important that the playpen being used is safe for the child. Unsafe playpens may collapse which could injure the baby.

The Planets

The Planets Op. 32 is a seven-movement orchestral musical suite by the British composer Gustav Holst, written between 1914 and 1916. The first complete public performance happened during World War I on 10 October 1918 in Birmingham, with Appleby Matthews directing the orchestra. However, an earlier premiere for only a small group of people was held on 29 September 1918 in the Queen's Hall in London, with the orchestra directed by Adrian Boult. The seven pieces are all named after planets.

Kota Kinabalu

Kota Kinabalu (), formerly Jesselton, is the capital of Sabah state in Malaysia. It is also the capital of the West Coast Division of Sabah. The city is on the northwest coast of Borneo facing the South China Sea. The Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park is on one side and Mount Kinabalu, which gave the city its name, is nearby. Kota Kinabalu proper has a population of 579,304, while the larger urban area has an estimated population of 700,000. It is the largest urban centre in Sabah and the sixth largest in Malaysia.

Kota Kinabalu is often known as K.K. within Malaysia and internationally. It is a major tourist destination and a popular gateway for travellers visiting Sabah and Borneo. Kinabalu National Park is about 90 kilometres from the city and there are many tourist attractions in and around the city. Kota Kinabalu is also one of the major industrial and commercial centres of East Malaysia. These two factors combine to make Kota Kinabalu one of the fastest growing cities in Malaysia.

In the late 1800s, the British North Borneo Company (BNBC) began to establish colonies throughout North Borneo (now Sabah). In 1882, the Company founded a small settlement on Gaya Island (Pulau Gaya), which was already inhabited by the Bajau people. In 1897, this first settlement was burned and destroyed by Bajau rebels led by Mat Salleh.

After the rebellion, the Company decided to relocate the settlement to the more easily defended mainland opposite Pulau Gaya. A nearby fishing village named "Api-Api" (see "Original names" below), was the next settlement of the Company. This new location was then designated as the main harbour and port, as well as the terminus for the North Borneo Railway. It was expanded and renamed "Jesselton", named after Sir Charles Jessel, the then Vice Chairman of the Company.

Eventually, Jesselton became a major trading post of North Borneo, dealing in rubber, rattan, honey, and wax. The new railway was used to transport goods to Jesselton harbour. Bajau uprisings during these times were not uncommon, and the Company worked to quell the long-standing threat of piracy in the region.

Jesselton was razed by the retreating British early in World War II to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Japanese. After the Japanese takeover of Borneo, it was again renamed Api. Rebellions against the Japanese military administration have taken place in Api. One major rebellion occurred in 1943 by the group called Kinabalu Guerrillas, consisting of local inhabitants. The rebellion was however quelled by the Japanese forces, after their leader, Albert Kwok, was arrested and executed in 1944. At the later stages of the war, what remained of the town was destroyed again by Allied bombings as part of the Borneo Campaign in 1945, leaving only three buildings standing. The war in North Borneo ended with the official surrender of the Japanese 37th Army by Lieutenant General Baba Masao in Labuan on September 10, 1945.

After the war, the British North Borneo Company returned to administer Jesselton but was unable to finance the huge costs of reconstruction. They gave control of North Borneo to the British Crown in 1946. The new colonial government elected to rebuild Jesselton as the capital of North Borneo instead of Sandakan, which had also been destroyed by the war.

When North Borneo together with Sarawak, Singapore & Federation of Malaya formed the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, the state became known as Sabah and Jesselton remained its capital. Jesselton was renamed Kota Kinabalu on September 30, 1968 and received official city status from the Malaysian government on February 2, 2000.

Kota Kinabalu is named after Mount Kinabalu, about 90 kilometres east-northeast of the city. The meaning and origin of the name "Kinabalu" is uncertain. One theory suggests it means "Chinese widow", where "Kina" meaning "Chinese" (person) in Kadazandusun language, and "balu" meaning "widow" in Malay language. This theory derives from a folk tale about a Chinese prince who came to the mountain in search of a giant pearl which was guarded by a dragon at the top of the mountain. While he was here, he married a local woman but later returned to China and left the woman heartbroken. Alternatively, it is also argued that "Kinabalu" or "Akinabalu" is the name of the dragon which guards the giant pearl itself. Another theory suggests that the term is derived from the name "Aki Nabalu" meaning the "revered place of the dead", in which, "Aki" means "ancestors" or "grandfather", and "Nabalu" being a name for the mountain in the Dusun language. Finally there is also a source claiming that the term originated from "Ki Nabalu", where "Ki" meaning "have" or "exist", and "Nabalu" meaning "spirit of the dead".

"Kota" is a Malay word for a "fort", "town", or a "city". It is also used formally in a few other Malaysian towns and cities, for example, Kota Bahru, Kota Tinggi, and Kota Kemuning. It could also be used informally to refer to any towns or cities. Henceforth, a direct translation of the name "Kota Kinabalu" into English would be "City of Kinabalu" or "Kinabalu City".

Besides Jesselton, there has been a number of other claims as to the original name for Kota Kinabalu. The most popular, as mentioned above, is "Api-Api", or sometimes simply "Api", which is a Malay word meaning 'Fire'. It was apparently named as such by the mainly Bajau locals to denote the blazing of the British administrative office in Pulau Gaya instigated by Mat Salleh, as well as other blazing incidents normally perpetrated by pirates. There were claims however that it was actually named after a nearby river called "Sungai Api-Api". Another theory states that "Api-Api" is the local name of the common "Avicennia" tree that grows in abundance around the area. Transliterated into the formal Chinese name of "Ya Bi" (亚庇 yà bì), the Hakkas here too adopted this name (亚庇,"ah-bi" which pronounced in Hakka, Chinese dialects) and some still use this name to this day. Besides Api-Api, another suggested historical name was "Deasoka", which roughly means "below the coconut tree" in the Bajau language. The Bajau locals purportedly used this name to refer to a village on the southern part of the city which was filled with coconut trees. Another name was "Singgah Mata" which literally mean "transit eye", but can be loosely translated as meaning "pleasing to the eye". It is a name purportedly given by fishermen from Pulau Gaya referring to the strip of land of what is today Kota Kinabalu city center. Today, all these names have been immortalised into names of streets or buildings around the city. Some examples are: "Lintasan Deasoka", "Api-Api Centre", "Jalan Singgah Mata", and "Jesselton Point".

Being the capital city of Sabah, Kota Kinabalu plays an important role in the political and economic welfare of the population in the entire state. It is the seat of the state government where almost all of their ministries and agencies are based. Most of the Malaysian federal government agencies and departments are also in Kota Kinabalu. The Sabah State Legislative Assembly is at nearby Likas Bay. There are four Members of Parliament (MPs) representing four parliamentary constituencies in the city: Sepanggar ("P.171"), Kota Kinabalu ("P.172"), Putatan ("P.173"), and Penampang ("P.174"). The city also elects 9 representatives to the state legislature from the state assembly districts of Karambunai, Inanam, Likas, Api-Api, Luyang, Tanjung Aru, Petagas, Kepayan, and Moyog.

Kota Kinabalu currently has five sister cities.

The internal roads linking different parts of the city are generally state roads constructed and maintained by the state Public Works Department. Most major internal roads are dual-carriageways. One of the major road here is Jalan Lintas-Jalan Tuaran Bypass, which together serves almost as a ring road, circling the city and connecting the districts and suburbs surrounding the city, namely, Putatan, Penampang, Luyang, Likas, Inanam, Menggatal, Sepanggar, and Tuaran. There is currently no freeway in the city nor in any part of Sabah. The city is linked by highways to distant towns around Sabah and these are mainly federal roads maintained by the national Public Works Department. Highway routes from Kota Kinabalu include:

Public transportation:

Regular bus services operate around the city. Minibuses or vans are also used besides buses as an alternative public transportation. There are two main bus terminals in the central business area. The terminal along Jalan Tun Razak provides internal bus services towards different part of the city and its outskirts. Another terminal near Bandaran Berjaya provides intercity services towards destinations south of the city (Papar, Tenom, Beaufort, and others). The Kota Kinabalu (North) Bus Terminal in Inanam provides intercity buses heading towards destinations north and north-east of the city (Tuaran, Kudat, Ranau, Sandakan, Tawau, Semporna, and others). Taxicabs too are around the city.

A railway system formerly known as the North Borneo Railway was established in 1896 by the British North Borneo Company. It was built for the main purpose of transporting commodities from the interior to the port in Kota Kinabalu during the British occupation. The railway line connects Kota Kinabalu with Tenom and several other towns in between, and it is the only railway system operating in East Malaysia. Today the railway is known as Sabah State Railway, and it provides daily services for commuters, travellers, as well as for cargo transportation. A separate company operates the leisure tour also called the "North Borneo Railway", which caters mainly for tourists. The train station and terminus are in Tanjung Aru.

Kota Kinabalu International Airport (KKIA) provides flights linking the city with other domestic and international destinations. It is a secondary hub for Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia and it consists of two terminals. It is the second busiest airport in Malaysia after Kuala Lumpur International Airport and it is a major gateway into Sabah and East Malaysia. It serves international flights to Bandar Seri Begawan, Shenzhen, Seoul, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Macau, Manila, Cebu, Singapore, Taibei, Gaoxiong, and other domestic cities. It is also a secondary hub for MASWings, which serves flights to smaller towns and rural areas in East Malaysia.

Kota Kinabalu has two ports: Kota Kinabalu Port and Sepanggar Bay Container Port (SBCP). Kota Kinabalu Port mainly loose/bulk cargo, while SBCP operates as a naval base for the Royal Malaysian Navy, oil depot and all containerised cargo. In 2004, Kota Kinabalu Port handled about 3.6 million tonnes of freight cargo, the third highest in the state after Sandakan Port, and Tawau Port. It however handles the most number of containers in the state, with 153,793 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of containers handled in 2006. Sepanggar Bay Port will have the capacity to handle 200,000 TEU annually when its container terminal is completed. All ports in Sabah are managed and operated by Sabah Ports Sdn Bhd.

Kota Kinabalu Ferry Terminal is a passenger ferry terminal at Jesselton Point near the K.K. port. It provides ferry and motorboat services to the nearby islands for tourists as well as for commuters living on the islands. There are also regular scheduled ferry services to Labuan.

The majority of the population are Muslim Malays.

Temple of Jupiter (Pompeii)

The Temple of Jupiter, Capitolium, or Temple of the Capitoline Triad was a temple in the Roman city of Pompeii in Italy. At the beginning this temple was dedicated to Jupiter alone, it was built in the mid 2nd century BC at the same time as the temple of Apollo was being worked on - this was the era at which Roman influence over Pompeii was at its height and so Roman Jupiter beat out the Greek Apollo and Jupiter(, Juno, and Minerva) in towns newly taken over by the Romans. This was also true for Pompeii, where the Temple of Jupiter that was already there was enlarged and made more Roman when the Romans took over.

Pompeii was taken over by the Romans beginning in 310 BC. It was still allowed to mostly run itself, however, until the Italic Revolt against Rome at the beginning of the 1st century BC.

The building style of the town was largely borrowed from the Greeks, but Roman rule would soon lead to changes in this style. As opposed to the previous Samnite rulers of Pompeii, the Romans thought that the building style was very important in religious as well as everyday life. Pompeii was changed into a much more public and open place. Public buildings and spaces would eventually be able to be found all over the city. 

The temple had been built in 150 BC to be a very noticeable part of the forum, and it became Pompeii's main temple after Rome took over. The inside of the temple housed the main room of the temple, which held the statues of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, and which only the priests were allowed to enter.

In 62 an earthquake shook the city of Pompeii, destroying much of the Temple of Jupiter. After this, the much smaller Temple of Jupiter Meilichios became the main place of worship to Jupiter and his group of three (triad). The first Temple of Jupiter was still waiting to be fixed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79, burying the town of Pompeii under lava and ash. The hollow temple can still be seen in Pompeii today.

Milang, South Australia

Milang is small town that is found on the shores of Lake Alexandrina, just over 20 kms from Strathalbyn, South Australia.

The town was laid out in December 1853. Milang was a very important port on the Murray River System between 1860 and 1880, before the railway line was built to connect Adelaide to Morgan farther upstream.

Gilbert's potoroo

Gilbert's potoroo ("Potorous gilbertii") is an Australian marsupial, sometimes called a rat-kangaroo. It has a pointed face and it is about the size of a rabbit. Once thought to be extinct, it is listed as being critically endangered.It is the most endangered mammal and marsupial in the whole of Australia. There are only about 40 of the animals now left in the world. Gilbert's potoroo is one of the world's rarest mammals.

They live in a small area, about , on the southwest coast near Albany, Western Australia. This area is in the Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve. Gilbert's Potoroos have been released on nearby Bald Island, and are breeding successfully.

The first scientific discovery of the Gilbert’s potoroo happened in 1840, and it was named in 1841 after the English naturalist and explorer John Gilbert. Gilbert had collected several animals at King George Sound in Australia, including this potoroo. Gilbert’s potoroo was not seenagain for many years, even though many people had searched for them in the 1970s. The species was believed to be extinct for 120 years before it was re-discovered in 1994 in Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve. Liz Sinclair had been studying wallabies and caught the potoroo in one of her traps.

Potoroos live under thick bushes and shrubs. They have made tunnels and paths through the bush so they can get around easily. When moving slowly they use all four legs, but to move quickly they can hop like a kangaroo. Potoroos are nocturnal and they spend their days hiding. They only come out into the open very often. They live in small groups of between three to five animals. They eat different kinds of truffles and fungi. Australia has many different kinds of truffles and potoroos like to eat many of them. Potoroos have sharp three toed claws that help them dig into the ground to find the truffles growing in the soil. After eating them, the potoroos help spread the seeds of the truffles through their wastes. Scientists have found 40 different types of fungi in the waste from a Gilbert Potoroo.

The female potoroos can have two babies in a year, but only carry one at a time. They can keep a second embryo in a state of diapause while the first embryo is growing. If the first baby does not survive, the second baby can start growing right away. It is not known how long gestation is for Gilbert’s potoroo, but it is thought to be the same as the long-nosed potoroo; about 38 days. The baby potoroo is only about long when it is born. It lives in its mother's pouch for about 4 months.

When Gilbert’s potoroo was rediscovered, more animals were captured to start a breeding program. This would help increase the numbers of potoroos. A few young were born in the first couple of years, but then breeding just stopped. Many studies have looked at what they eat, and how they live, but they are still can not get the potoroos to breed in captivity

In 2001, a group was formed called the Gilbert’s potoroo Action Group (GPAG). This group helps educate and tell people about the potoroo. It also helps with raising money for more study and captive breeding programs for Gilbert’s potoroo.

Three potoroos, one male and two females, were moved to Bald Island in August 2005. This island is free from other animals, like cats and foxes, that would eat the potoroos. Since then, four more potoroos have been sent to start a breeding colony.

There is a lot of danger for the survival of Gilbert's potoroo. Because of the small area where they live, they could be lost in a bushfire. Foxes and cats could easily kill all the potoroos. There may not be enough potoroos to give them enough genetic differences to survive a virus. There is not enough natural bushland at Two Peoples Bay, and there is too much cleared land next to the nature reserve.

G-type main-sequence star

A GV star, or yellow dwarf, is a main-sequence star. It is of spectral type G and luminosity class V on the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram. The term "yellow dwarf" is a misnomer, because G-type stars actually range in color from white, for more luminous types like the Sun, to only very slightly yellow for the less massive and luminous G-type main-sequence stars. See spectral classification for a chart of star color by light type. 

GV stars are small (about 0.8 to 1.0 solar masses) and have a surface temperature of between 5,300 and 6,000 K. Like other main-sequence stars, a GV star turns hydrogen to helium in its core by means of nuclear fusion.

Our Sun is the most commonly known (and most easily seen) example of a GV star. Each second, it combines around 600 million tons of hydrogen to helium, changing about 4 million tons of matter to energy. Other GV stars include Alpha Centauri A, Tau Ceti, and 51 Pegasi.

Our own Sun looks yellow through the Earth's atmosphere due to Rayleigh scattering. Without that, it would look white. Even though the name "dwarf" is used to compare yellow main sequence stars from giant stars, yellow dwarfs like the Sun are 90% brighter than all of the stars in the Milky Way (which are largely orange dwarfs, red dwarfs, and white dwarfs).

A GV star fuses hydrogen nuclei together and release energy for around 10 billion years. After the hydrogen is used up, the star will grow to many times its earlier size and become a red giant like Aldebaran. Eventually the red giant will lose its outer layers of gas, which will become a planetary nebula, while the inside of the star (also known as the core) will cool and shrink into a small, very dense white dwarf.

Johan Neeskens

Johan Neeskens (born 15 September 1951) is a former Dutch football player. He has played for Netherlands national team. He is considered to be one of the greatest midfielders of his generation as well as being regarded as one of the best Dutch players of all time. This is the definition that Neeskens gave for himself, which however appears too reductive. He knew how to best interpret that universality of role preached at the time in Holland: a true all-round wildcard, Neeskens was a complete and continuous player, capable of adapting to play almost anywhere on the pitch.

He possessed remarkable athletic skills thanks to which he gave support and completeness to the technical skills of his teammates. Ideal fulcrum of the midfield, with his passes and high-precision shots he enhanced the qualities of his colleagues: speed and fluidity. Neeskens perfectly expressed what Michels and Kovacs preached in the Netherlands: "a player must be complete and continuous, able to adapt to play in any area of ​​the pitch". He was also a good header and an infallible penalty taker.

His roughness came to light with the expulsion in the semi-final of the 1976 European Championships against Czechoslovakia. His determination on the pitch also made him a true leader when it was necessary to take the team by the hand in the most difficult moments of the match.

Raised in the RCH youth academy, at 19 he won his first Eredivisie with Ajax. From there the following year begins the great cycle of lancers who win three European Cups in a row. In recent years Neeskens stands out as "one of the best defenders of the Old Continent".

On the eve of the German World Cup Neeskens had signed for Barcelona, ​​yielding to the court of his old teacher Rinus Michels, anxious to reunite him and Cruyff. Upon his arrival he meets a Camp Nou saddened by the departure of the Peruvian Hugo Sotil due to the limit of foreigners in the team but Neeskens does not take long to become an idol of the Barça fans, not only for his qualities as a footballer but also for his willingness to identify with the club and with the Catalan nation. This combination makes him one of the most emblematic players in the history of the club. For him in Spain a King's Cup, a Cup Winners' Cup and 219 games with 53 goals. To remember in 1979 the spectacular final in Basel against Fortuna Düsseldorf ended 4-3 in extra time. It would have been his last match with the blaugrana shirt.

Like other great champions of his generation, in the late 1970s Neeskens continued his career in the North American league, with the NY Cosmos shirt. After the New York experience, he returns home to Groningen for a season. He returns again to the United States where he plays in the South Florida Sun, a United Soccer League team, with him he won the 1985 championship. In America he also plays in indoor soccer, playing in the KC Comets.

Finally, he returned to Europe to end his competitive career in Switzerland in 1991.

A precocious talent, he made his senior international debut at the age of 19 on 11 November 1970 against East Germany. Neeskens became a star of the international firmament in 1974, participating in the 1974 FIFA World Cup. In the first group stage he scored two goals (both from penalties) in the 4-1 win against Bulgaria; in the second group stage he scored as many goals, opening the scoring against East Germany and Brazil (both ended 2-0 for the "oranje"), ultimately being much more decisive than Johan Cruijff. This last goal, scored with a precise diagonal, was celebrated in an exuberant way by the whole Dutch team. The Netherlands thus reached the final where they faced the hosts of West Germany. It was Neeskens who scored the penalty caused by a foul of Uli Hoeneß on Cruyff, giving him the advantage in the second minute of play. Despite this episode, the match will end 2-1 for the Germans. Neeskens thus closed the world championship as top scorer of the "oranje" with 5 goals, a good booty for a midfielder. 

Two years later Neeskens took part in the 1976 European Championships, in which, however, his performance failed to reach the peaks of the previous world championship. The Netherlands qualified for the second round only thanks to the better goal difference than Poland. The match won against the Poles, finished 3-0, in which Neeskens opened the scoring was decisive. Also scoring in the 5-0 against Belgium in the quarter-finals, Neeskens will be sent off during the semi-final against Czechoslovakia for a bad reaction to a foul by Pollak, paving the way for his national team to be eliminated, defeat against the predictions of eve for 3-1. The oranjes will then win the final for third place in extra time without Neeskens and Cruijff who returned early to Barcelona.

At Argentina 1978 the Netherlands showed up without Cruijff, so it was up to Neeskens, Rensenbrink and Rep to lead the national team to the final which they lost 3-1 in extra time against the hosts. The Argentine Mundial was the end of a once-in-a-lifetime cycle for the oranje national team. Neeskens ended his career as his country's representative with a total of 49 competitive matches and scored 17 goals.

Confederation

A confederation is a group of countries that, by treaty, have given some of their powers to a central government. They do this in order to coordinate their actions in a number of areas. This is like a federation, but without the association being a new country. 

A confederation is not the same as a federation, but they have a similarity. A confederation is a group of countries, a federation is a country.

The only example today is the European Union. Switzerland still has the official Latin name "Confœderatio Helvetica", since it was founded in 1291, as a confederation. It later became a federation but kept the word "Confœderatio".

Les noces

Les Noces () is a ballet in four scenes, originally for the "Ballets Russes" of Sergei Diaghilev. The ballet was choreographed by Bronislava Nijinska and the music and words were written by Igor Stravinsky. The music is written for voices, four pianos, and percussion.

The ballet was first presented on 13 June 1923 at the Théâtre Gaîte-Lyrîqué in Paris. The ballet is sometimes called a "dance cantata", and the music is sometimes performed as a concert piece.

In 1915 ballet producer Sergei Diaghilev wanted to create a ballet called "La Liturgie". Its background would be the Greek Orthodox Church. Stravinsky was a strong Christian, and did not want to write this ballet. He turned instead to Russian folk songs for "Les Noces". He had started to think about this in 1913. Michel Fokine started the choreography but Vaslav Nijinsky took over. Leonide Massine stepped in for Nijinsky. When Massine left, Bronislava Nijinska designed the dancing.

Design for the ballet (sets and clothing) was done by Natalia Goncharova. Goncharova, an outstanding artist, made two complete designs before her third was accepted. The first two designs were rejected because they did not suit either the dancing or the musical score. The ballet, though based on a folk tale, was modernist in style: Stravinsky and Nijinska thought it was important for its design to be in sympathy with this.

The bride, Nastasia, is having her hair done. She complains that it hurts when pulled. The choir sing to her about how beautiful her life will be with her husband, Fétis. The nightingales will sing to them in the garden. The choir sings to the Virgin Mary. They sing about the husband-to-be and his fair hair. They ask for a blessing for the young couple. The actual marriage ceremony is not seen. In the last of the four scenes, we see the wedding feast. The people are happy and start to get drunk. The husband and wife are led to the bedroom.

The ballet is still in the repertoires of some major ballet companies, such as the Royal Ballet. It was performed in 1936 by Colonel de Basil's "Ballets Russes", one of the successor companies to that of Diaghilev. Its post-WWII revival in London (1966) was personally supervised by Nijinska. Because of this, the ballet is still danced to its original choreography. It was also performed at Stuttgart (1974) and Paris (1976). Jerome Robbins choreographed it in the American Ballet Theatre version of 1965.

Fort-Liberté

Fort-Liberté (Kréyòl: "Fòlibète"; English: "Fort Liberty") is a city in northeast Haiti, on the Atlantic coast. It is the capital city of the Nord-Est "Département".

The city is on the "Baie de Fort-Liberté" ("Fort-Liberté Bay") about 56 km east of Cap-Haïtien and to the west of the Dominican Republic. It is also the chief town of an "arrondissement" (a part of a department) with the same name. The "arrondissement" has three "communes" (a "commune" is like a municipality): Fort-Liberté, Ferrier (Kreyòl: "Ferye") and Perches (Kreyòl: "Opèch").

Between 1503 and 1505, Nicolás de Ovando, Spanish governor of the Hispaniola, founded the town of "Puerto Real" (English, "Royal Port") where is the present town of "Caracol", to the west of Fort-Liberté. But soon this town was abandoned and the people moved to the east, founding in 1578 a new town with the Taíno name of the region: Bayajá.

In 1606, those persons living in the old Spanish towns of Bayajá and Yaguana had, by orders of the Spanish king, to move to the eastern part of the island, to a new town called Bayaguana, combining the two old names.

Later, when French people founded a new town in this place, they called it Fort-Dauphin in 1731, named after the "Dauphin" (the "Dolphin", son of the French king Louis XV). When the French Republic was founded, the name was changed to "Fort-Liberté" in 1792. After Henri Christophe became King Henri I of Haiti in 1811, he renamed the city Fort-Royal. In 1820, after the death of Christophe, the name was changed back to Fort Liberté.

There are several forts built around the bay. An important one is "Fort Dauphin", sometimes called "Fort Saint Joseph" (Patron Saint of the city) or "Fort Liberté". Other forts in the area are "Fort de la Bouque", "Batterie de l'Anse", "Fort Saint Charles" and "Fort Saint Frédérique".

Fort-Liberté has a small port that also receives international products and serves as a fishing port. Local agricultural products include sugarcane and citrus fruits.

John Gilbert (naturalist)

John Gilbert (1812? – 28 June 1845) was an English naturalist and explorer. He collected animal specimens for English naturalist John Gould. Australia's rarest animal, Gilbert's Potoroo, "Potorous gilberti", and the Gilbert-Einasleigh River were named after him.

Gilbert was born on 14 March, but the exact year is not known. It must have been between 1810 and 1815 and so most books use 1812. Gilbert was a taxidermist for the Zoological Society of London. He met English naturalist John Gould and went to Australia in 1838 with Gould. Gould paid him £100 a year to collect and preserve animals and birds for him

Gould and Gilbert arrived in Hobart on the ship "Parsee" on 19 September 1838. They were going to collect animal and bird specimens for Gould's books. Both worked in Tasmania for a few months. On 4 February 1839, Gilbert went to the Swan River settlement. He worked there for a year, mainly around Perth, collecting for Gould. Gilbert then sailed for Sydney, and in June 1840 took a ship to Port Essington in the north of Australia. In March 1841 he sailed to Singapore, stopping at Timor on the way. From there he sailed for London and arrived at the end of September. He had collected a very large number of birds for Gould, and made many notes on their habits. 

In February 1842 Gilbert returned Australia to collect further specimens. He reached Perth in July and stayed for 17 months in Western Australia. He made his most interesting discoveries among the Wongan Hills, about 100 miles north-east of Perth. He was a fine naturalist and his notes on birds, their habits, diet, song and the names given them by the aborigines were all of great interest and value. Gilbert collected specimens of 432 birds, including 36 species new to Western Australia. He collected 318 mammals, including 22 species not previously known in the west. By the end of January 1844 he was back in Sydney and during the next six months worked his way to the Darling Downs in Queensland.

Gilbert joined Ludwig Leichhardt's expedition in September 1844 which was going to cross Australia's north, from Brisbane to Port Essington. Gilbert, with his experience in the Australian bush, was unofficially the second in charge. The journey was much slower than planned and food supplies were getting low. On 28 June 1845, near the Gulf of Carpentaria, Gilbert was killed when aborigines attacked the explorers. He was buried at the site, but the grave has never been found. The rest of the group reached Port Essington in December 1845.

Leichhardt kept Gilbert's papers and his diary, which, however, was lost for nearly 100 years before its discovery by A. H. Chisholm. Chisholm's research showed Gilbert as a man of much ability and fine character who somewhat ironically had a great respect for the aboriginals. There is a memorial to him in St James church, Sydney with the Latin phrase "Dulce et decorum est pro scientia mori" - "it is sweet and fitting to die for science."

Turbojet

A turbojet is a kind of jet engine that works by squeezing air into a small space, mixing it with fuel, and setting it on fire. The mixture of fuel and air goes out the back of the engine and pushes it forward. As it leaves the engine it spins a turbine which turns a gas compressor at the front which sucks in more air and compresses it. 

Turbofan engines are more complex. They are more common today because they can make more power, for the same amount of fuel, than a turbojet. They also make less noise. Supersonic aircraft still use the simpler kind.

2001 Bangladesh–India border clashes

The 2001 Indian-Bangladeshi border conflict was a short armed conflict between India and Bangladesh over the poorly marked International border between the countries during 2001. Over the issue of Indians trespassing and invaded Bangladeshi territories.

Minicoy Island

Minicoy Island or Maliku (Mahal language: މަލިކު, məliku) is the only inhabited island of the Maliku Atoll. The locals, the "Malikun", call their island "Maliku," as do the Maldivians, the closest Maldive island to Minicoy is Thuraakunu. Since 1956, the Indian Government has forbidden contact between people of the same nationals of the two islands despite their geographic proximity and ethnographic similarities. The cultural traits of Minicoy differ from those of any other Indian islands of Lakshadweep. Manners, customs and food are similar to those of the Maldives to the south of Minicoy and Mahl, a dialect of Dhivehi, is the language spoken on the island. This language employs the Tāna script, written from right to left. Minicoy Islanders, like the close islands of the Maldives follow Sunni Islam. The islands were probably Buddhist before like they were in the Maldives. In August 1947 the possessions of the Emperor of British India passed to either the Indian Union or Pakistan according to an agreed demarcation line. The rulers of the independent countries that were vassals of the Emperor had the choice of acceding to either the Dominion of India or Pakistan.

While Maliku was a sovereign possession of the Emperor and not that of an independent country such as, Kashmir or Hyderabad State, it is unclear why India felt it necessary to hold a plebiscite in Maliku in 1956 to determine whether or not the people of Maliku wished to join the Indian Union. However Since 1965 Pakistan wished Maliku to return to the Republic of Maldives.

Vasopressin

Vasopressin (ADH, AVP) is the hormone which controls the production of urine in the bladder. It is secreted by the pituitary gland based on the salt concentration of the blood. It is negative feedback: the more concentrated the salt in the blood is, the more vasopressin is secreted, which in turn makes the kidney tubules more permeable, allowing more water to be reabsorbed into the blood and creating less, but more concentrated, urine. It also triggers feelings of thirst.

Razakar (Pakistan)

Razakars was the name given to a paramilitary force organized by the Pakistan Army during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. The word, originating from Persian, literally means "volunteer". It was composed of mostly pro-Pakistani Bengalis and Urdu-speaking migrants of the former East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). Initially, the force was under the command of local pro-Pakistani committees. But through the East Pakistan Razakar Ordinance (promulgated by General Tikka Khan on 1 June, 1971) and a Ministry of Defence, Pakistan, ordinance (promulaged 7 September,1971), Razakars were recognized as members of the Pakistan Army.

Qasim Razvi

Syed Kasim Razvi (17 July 1902 – 15 January 1970), also Qasim Razvi, was the leader of a local militia in India, the Razakars of Hyderabad State, who blocked accession into the Republic of India after the Partition of British Indian empire against the wishes of the local majority Hindu-population, and fought against the Indian forces during occupation.

Razvi held views that Hyderabad should eventually join Pakistan in a major war against Bharat, as clearly evidenced by some of his speeches and publications in Hyderabadi newspapers. Razvi was politically powerful and a close advisor of the Nizam, whom he encouraged to defy the infidel government, and blocked the invasion of Hyderabad into Republic of India. At the height of the crisis, Razvi had placed his allies in influential posts, and was virtually dictating the Nizam's policy on the issue. Razvi even traveled to Delhi and had a stormy meeting with Indian leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. He is quoted to have said "Death with the sword in hand, is always preferable to extinction by a mere stroke of the pen. "prompting the Indian government to call him the "Nizam's Frankenstein monster."

After Indian military intervention, Razvi was placed under house arrest and tried under Indian laws on seditious activities and inciting communal violence. He was released in the 1950s, and he later fled to Pakistan.

Razakars (Hyderabad)

Razakars were private militia organized by Qasim Razvi which supporter the rule of Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII and resist the integration of Hyderabad State into India. 
Eventually, the Indian army routed the Razakars and the group was disbanded after India annexed the state.

Qasim Razvi, the military chief of Hyderabad State, fled to Pakistan where he was granted asylum. Majlis, a contemporary political party in the present Hyderabad owes its foundations to Qasim Razvi.

Razakar literally means "volunteer". There were types of Razakars: muslim Razakar,Hindu razakar, Reddy razakar and congress Razakars. 

Quoting an article of K F Rustomjee, the former DGP of Maharashtra and BSF, "Captain Panduranga Reddy" said that the policemen from Akola district in then Central Province were sent in to Hyderabad state in the garb of Razakars to create turmoil and blame the Nizam government. Rustomjee was SP of Akola at the time. Captain Reddy called the Communists as traitors, who encouraged violence to spread their agenda.


Al-Shams (East Pakistan)

Al-Shams () was a militia force formed in East Pakistan in early 1971 by the Pakistan Army.

Al-Shams is an Arabic word meaning 'The Sun'. Al Shams was Pakistani armed groups formed by the Pakistan Army to fight out and resist Mukti Bahini and support the army in its campaigns in the former East Pakistan provincial region.


Al-Badr (East Pakistan)

Al-Badar (আল বদর) was a paramilitary force formed in East Pakistan in 1971 by the national Pakistan Army.

Al-Badar means The Battlefield of Badar. The politics of the force were intermingled with jihad, the religious war or holy war of Muhammad 1400 years earlier. However, the war between Pakistan and Bengali separatists was a nationalistic war, not a religious one.

On March 27, 1971, after beginning the Pakistani Civil War, Pakistani military forces needed military support from Bengali nationalists supporters who still wanted to be part of Pakistan, or did not like Indian involvement in the movement; as well as the non-Bengali muhajirs in order to abolish the independence fighters of Bangladesh, the Mukti Bahini, Hemayet Bahini and Kaderiya Bahini. 

The Al Badar were formed to find these independence fighters and to be guides as well as co-fighters who were familiar with the local terrain. The force was composed of madrasa students and teachers, Bengali supporters of Muslim League and Jamaat E Islami, and "muhajirs" coming from non-Bengali part of India.

There were three type of Paramilitary forces Pakistan formed,

1.Razakars: refuges who were came from other parts of India during separation of India and Pakistan, and settled in East Pakistan.

2. Al-Badar: Bengali Muslim Students from Colleges, universities and madrasah, who were loyal to Jamat-e-islami.3. Al-Shams: Bengali Madrasah Students, teachers & supporters of Islamic parties other than Jamat-E-Islami (these smaller parties included Nejam-e-Islami and various factions of Muslim League).

Al-Badar was a very organized par military force among those three forces, with their own hierarchy of organization and reporting system.

The Al Badar were given a variety of combat and non-combat tasks including:

On 16 December 1971, Pakistan unconditionally surrendered. Members of Al-Badr, along with other Razakars, Al-Shams, and Shanti Committee also surrendered to the Mitro Bahini's. As they all were Bengali it was supposed that Bangladesh would treat them as an opposition party, that is they would arrest them and treat them as prisoners of war. However most of them were tortured, killed by Mukti Bahini, or forced into exile from Bangladesh.

All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference

The All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference is a political party in Azad Jammu and Kashmir. 

In 1932 Pro-Congress Sheikh Abdullah formed Kashmir's first political party, in Srinagar, the All Jammu & Kashmir Muslim Conference, with a demand for merger of Kashmir and Jammu with British India. His party was renamed the National Conference in 1939 to suite the secular nature of Kashmiri culture. The All Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, led by Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah, had a secular ideology and wished to create a secular, democratic but independent Kashmir with close ties to British India. 

When the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference was converted into a secular political party in 1939, the Muslim leaders amended the Constitution of the Muslim Conference, renamed it the All Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, modified its objectives and opened its membership to all the people of the State. On 13 June 1941, the breakaway factions of the National Conference revived the Muslim Conference under the leadership of Choudry Ghualm Abbas. 

The All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference led the Muslim movement for accession into Pakistan. On July 19, 1947, a convention of All Jammu & Kashmir Muslim Conference, adopted the "Accession to Pakistan Resolution" demanding accession of the Kashmir state to Pakistan. 

Since 1948 the All-Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference has been the political party in power in Azad Jammu and Kashmir.

Cornish nationalism

The Cornish self-government movement (sometimes referred to as Cornish nationalism) is a social movement which seeks greater autonomy for Cornwall. The movement says that Cornwall is not just a county of England (which is its current status) but a duchy and a distinctive British nation which has never been formally incorporated into England by an Act of Union. Supporters of Cornish self-government who say that Cornwall is, or ought to be, a separate legal entity from England do not necessarily mean to advocate full independence from the United Kingdom. They want official recognition for Cornwall as one of the home nations of the UK.

Some supporters of Cornish self-government question the legitimacy of English rule in Cornwall, due to the failure of the Parliament of England to pass an Act of Union. Their claims are not generally recognised. Some people are supportive of the Cornish Assembly Campaign. The Cornish National Party is a social democratic political party in Cornwall to which some Cornish nationalists belong. It wanted Cornish independence from the United Kingdom. it split from Mebyon Kernow, the other Cornish political party in 1975.

Calculator

A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, most calculators will add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Some also do square roots, and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs. Calculators are found everywhere. A smartphone or other computer can also act as a calculator. 

Some calculators, like the abacus, will work without electricity. Others, like the electronic calculator, use batteries. Some calculators are simple, and can only add, subtract, multiply and divide, and sometimes take square roots. Scientific calculators can do many other things, such as use exponents (or powers or indices) and trigonometry functions.

A printing calculator can print its results.

A pocket calculator is a small calculator that helps people do arithmetic. It is so small that it can be put in a pocket. Its most common use is for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Many pocket calculators are powered by solar cells. They are commonly seen in schools and businesses and can be used quickly and efficiently for simple mathematical problems. Other names are 'miniature calculator' or 'mini calculator'.

A scientific calculator can do more things. It can often use exponents (or powers or indices), pi, trigonometric ratios, and the order of operations. Scientific calculators can also use bigger numbers. They tend to cost more than pocket calculators. Many are also programmable. The user can make a program directly with the calculator, or transfer one from a computer. 

A GST calculator is a tool used to compute the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on goods or services in a given transaction. It helps individuals and businesses accurately determine the amount of GST applicable, aiding in financial planning, budgeting, and compliance with tax regulations.

ITV Yorkshire

ITV Yorkshire (originally Yorkshire Television) is an ITV franchise based in Leeds. ITV Yorkshire broadcasts to Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. ITV Yorkshire has made successful programmes such as Emmerdale, Heartbeat, The Beiderbecke Trilogy, Rising Damp, Harry's Game, The Darling Buds of May, Only When I Laugh and Duty Free. Yorkshire Television also produces the Calander news programme.

The headquarters of ITV Yorkshire are at The Leeds Studios in the Burley area of Leeds.

For almost 35 years, Yorkshire Television's on-screen identity always revolved around the use of the station logo: the chevron. This yellow symbol was seen on nearly all of Yorkshire Television's idents and presentation. The first symbol used was a black and white chevron, formed by slit-scan techniques and accompanied by an orchestral version of the tune "On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at", a famous Yorkshire folk song. This music was later to become the station's jingle. This ident continued until Yorkshire Television officially commenced their colour broadcasts in November 1969.

The new colour ident featured the yellow chevron on a black background with the still caption card "Yorkshire Television Colour Production", along with a simplified version of "On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at". This ident was modified in 1981, so that the caption "Colour Production" was changed to "In Colour", and in 1982 the colour caption was removed altogether. The new version of the jingle was at a lower pitch than was previously composed.

Supplementing the ident throughout this period were idents promoting the station's coverage, with the slogan ""Serving Six Million Viewers"". One version, in 1983 featured a giant chevron logo, made up out of smaller chevrons, and another in 1986 featured the view zooming in from space, to the Yorkshire TV region, which then flipped over, becoming the chevron. This last version was computer animated, with 3D-style lettering and chevron.

On 5 January 1987, Yorkshire Television introduced a new ident, entitled "Liquid Gold", featuring a pool of liquified gold, with the chevron rising up from it, and rotating into the sky, where the station name joins it. This ident features a fully orchestrated version of the theme tune and reportedly cost £40,000 to make. This was occasionally supplemented by a large rotating chevron over a gradient-ed blue background, used over continuity.

On 1 September 1989, Yorkshire Television adopted the first ITV generic look, featuring the large ITV logo, addition ident was also used where a static chevron on the same background as the main ident. On 7 January 1991, the ident was revised to allow the Chevron to appear full screen instead of being a segment of the 'V' which the company used until 23 October 1994. The whole package was used by Yorkshire Television, and an adapted version, where the whole chevron appeared in the V segment before moving into centre screen, was used before regional programming.

Upon YTV ending their use of the ITV generic look on 24 October 1994, a new ident was introduced, featuring a textured background with a central strip containing images of the region itself, with the chevron placed in the centre of said strip. The most noticeable thing about this ident set was the smooth nature of the chevron's appearance and, like the previous look, did not feature the ""On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at" "jingle, instead favouring a smooth orchestral jingle. The background was later changed from a cream to a light blue, and variations on the theme for special occasions and yearly themes were also introduced.

Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television adopted a new branding package, based on the concept of Channel 3. The new look was fully implemented in the Tyne Tees region on 2 September 1996, where all on-screen branding was replaced by giant numeral '3', and the Tyne Tees brand became secondary to 'Channel 3 North East, however the look was only partially implemented in the Yorkshire region a month after Tyne Tees's revamp. The entirety of Yorkshire's Channel 3 look included an ident which was later introduced on 4 November 1996 at the same year, where the chevron span against a light blue background with numeral '3's covering the background. Another ident featured the chevron with the '3' numeral embossed on the side, which would zoom into view, before revealing a spinning numeral 3, which in turn had YTV chevron on the middle of the 3 and when zoomed into, the chevron re-appeared spinning against the background. The look also heralded the return of the "On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at" tune, which was now noticeably higher in pitch.

The Channel 3 look was dropped on 9 March 1998, following Granada's acquisition of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television, with the look returning to a spinning chevron against a misty blue background, light blue during the day and dark blue in the evenings.

On 8 November 1999, Yorkshire Television adopted the second generic look, based on the theme of hearts, which was used for the entirety of the branding period before network programming. However, for local programming, Yorkshire created their own ident featuring a background of spinning chevrons, with pictures of the region featuring inside a central box.

On 28 October 2002, the brand was dropped in favour of a national ITV1 identity, in which local regional identities were dropped except before local programming, when the Yorkshire name appeared below the ITV1 logo only. These regional idents however were dropped by 2006.

Sojourner Truth

Sojourner Truth (about 1797 – November 26, 1883) was one of the first abolitionists and activists for women's rights. She was born as a slave, but escaped from slavery in 1826. She was born Isabella Baumfree, but renamed herself to 'Sojourner Truth' when she was 46 and announced she would travel to work against injustice.The name Sojourner Truth translates as itinerant preacher. She is one of the most widely known African American women of the 19 century. Her freedom was linked with the passage of a New-York State Law in 1799 that began the process of gradual emancipation.

She lectured widely on the cruelties she had experienced as a slave. She is best known for her "Ain't I a Woman?" speech, given at the Woman's Rights Convention of 1851. She also gave out speeches about abolishing slavery. Also, she became active in the Underground Railroad, helping blacks escape to freedom. She could only speak Dutch and at a young age soon learnt English. Sadly, she was beaten for not understanding the commands of her owners John and Sally Dumont. There is evidence that John beat her and Sally sexually abused her. 

Isabella Baumfree (Sojourner Truth) was born into slavery around 1797 in Swartekill, New York. Sojourner was the daughter of James Baumfree and Elizabeth Baumfree. Her family’s slave owner was Colonel Hardenbergh. Sojourner was born a slave and did not know how to read or write because nobody taught slaves how to. Out of 13 children, she was the youngest. In the first three decades of her life she was the property of five owners.It is In 1815 she dated fellow slave Thomas. Together they had 3 children. Her family was separated in 1806. In 1826 Isabella escaped to freedom with her infant daughter. Sojourner changed her name in 1843 from Isabella Baumfree to Sojourner Truth. She married and bore five children although only four of their names are known. She never learned to read or write and depended on others to take down her words while handling her correspondences. 

Sojourner was the first African American to win a trial against a white man. This trial was about getting her son Peter back. This was a great accomplishment for African Americans. During the Civil War Belle told the people about the Woman's Right to vote and became friends with some other people, which one of them threaten that she would not support the issue.She campaigned for Republican Ulysses S. Grant. She was one of the prominent Americans that attempted to vote in the 1872 election but was refused the right to. She went on to support herself by selling copies of her book, “The Narrative of Sojourner Truth “. During that time, she was a Battle Creek resident and property owner. She spent the last few years of her life and died in Battle Creek, Michigan on November 26, 1883. 

Quinkana

Quinkana is an extinct genus of large land crocodile that reached up to 7 meters (23 feet) in length. It lived in Australia from 24 million years ago to 40,000 years ago.

Amaranth

Amaranth ("Amaranthus" species) is a cosmopolitan genus of herbs. About 60 species are recognized, with flower clusters and foliage ranging from purple and red to gold.

Instant Runoff Voting

Instant runoff voting is a method of electing one political candidate to office from a list of more than two, but it can also be used for other group decisions. Voters rank the candidates from favorite to least favorite, with only their top choices being counted each time. Ballots are counted, and a series of simulated rounds is conducted. If no candidate has a majority of the votes in any round, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and those voters' next choice votes are then counted. This is repeated until a candidate has a majority.

Instant runoff voting has been used in Australia's lower house for more than 80 years. That house is strongly dominated by two parties. It has also been used to elect mayors in some cities in the United States. Voter turn out is typically the same as with plurality voting.

Proponents believe instant runoff voting allows them to vote for their first choice candidate and still help the lessor of evils if the first choice is eliminated. They believe Instant Runoff Voting to be the only way let voters vote their true intentions and undermine the two-party system. By having more candidates on the ballot, incumbents are more likely to be kicked out of office.

Opponents argue that if at least three candidates have a chance of winning, voting for one's favorite could cause a compromise candidate to lose in the first round. Their favorite might then lose against the least preferred candidate in the second round. Voters' votes cannot be transferred to their second choice if their second choice is eliminated before their first choice is. Voters often use their first choice vote for a compromise vote, the same as with plurality.

While theoretically simple, instant runoff voting often requires computers because the rankings on each ballot matter for determining the elimination order and can not be counted in aggregate. Opponents of Instant runoff voting often oppose computer counting of ballots, since it is difficult for ordinary citizens to count the ballots by hand and catch any fraud. The fact that a candidate has fewer votes does not mean the candidate is less popular but that the candidate was squeezed out on both sides of the political spectrum. Instant runoff voting can eliminate centrists in the last elimination.

Harrier Jump Jet

The Harrier Jump Jet, usually called the Harrier, is a British-designed military aeroplane. It was designed during the 1960s. The Harrier is well known as it can take off vertically. It can do this by changing the direction of thrust from its engines. It is sometimes called V/STOL, which means "Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing". It can carry heavier loads with a short takeoff than with a vertical one.

In 1967, the Bristol Engine Company proposed the radical idea of a directed thrust engine. Next, Hawker Aircraft designed an aeroplane that could meet the NATO specification for a "light tactical support fighter". There was no financial support for the development from HM Treasury, but support was found from NATO.

A prototype flew in 1960. Various changes were made and several preliminary versions flew including the "Kestrel" and the first Harriers flew for the RAF and Royal Navy in 1969. The planes were built in both Britain and the United States. They were redeveloped and manufactured by British Aerospace and Macdonald Douglas, companies which are now owned by BAE Systems and Boeing, respectively. At present the Boeing/BAE Systems AV-8B Harrier II is used by NATO countries such as the United States, Spain and Italy. A modified version, the BAE Systems/Boeing Harrier II is used by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy.

Between 1969 and 2003, 824 Harrier variants were delivered. Manufacture of new Harriers ended in 1997. The last remanufactured aircraft (Harrier II Plus configuration) was delivered in December 2003. This ended the Harrier production line.

The Harrier is used by many military forces. The United States Marine Corps and the Royal Air Force (RAF) use versions which are specially designed for taking off and landing on aircraft carriers. Other countries which use the Harrier include Thailand and India.

In 2006, the RAF introduced a new version of the Harrier, the GR/9. This is an updated version of the previous version, the GR/7. It has a top speed of 574 knots.

The Harrier was used a lot during the Falklands War. Harriers flew a total of 1,561 sorties, shot down 20 enemy planes (+ 3 probables) with 10 Harriers lost. Of the ten lost, six were shot down; the others were damaged in accidents on the carrier. The Sea Harriers made the Argentine Air Force much less effective than they hoped to be.

The Harrier can carry different equipment for each mission. It can carry missiles and bombs. It can also carry cameras to take pictures of the ground.

Barthold Fles

Barthold Fles (February 7, 1902 – December 19, 1989) was a Dutch-American who worked as a literary agent, helping writers find publishers to print their books. He also wrote books and articles, edited texts, translated books from German to English, and published poetry books.

Barthold Fles was born in Amsterdam on February 7, 1902. His family was Jewish but did not keep Jewish laws. His father, Louis Fles, thought that it was wrong for Jews and other people to be religious. Louis Fles imported typewriters and sold them, in addition to other office products, in several stores that he owned and to other stores. Barthold was his oldest son so his father wanted him to help him at work. Barthold did not want to work for his father. He only wanted to read. Barthold read in Dutch, German, English, and French. He read a lot and very fast. Barthold found a job at De Lange publishers. In 1923 he left for the United States.

In New York Fles first worked as a violinist, painting apartments, selling vacuum cleaners and for publishers. In 1933 he started his own business, a "literary agency", in Manhattan, New York. As a "literary agent" he mostly helped writers find publishers. He also sold stories for films or magazines and would find a writer to make a book that a publisher wanted. When Barthold started working as a literary agent, many of his clients were people who left Germany for the United States because of the Nazism in Germany. He held meetings for these writers in New York so that they could learn about publishing books and stories in the United States. Later, however, most of the writers he worked with were born in the United States.

In 1936 Barthold married Ruth Grünwald, a dancer at the Metropolitan Opera who had been just one year in the United States. Ruth helped Barthold with his work. Later she left him. Although he had no children of his own, Barthold Fles wrote two books for kids: "Slavonic rhapsody: the life of Antonín Dvořák" (in 1948) and "East Germany" (in 1973). He also wrote many articles and introductions to story collections. He translated three books from German to English. One of these books, Bambi's Children by Felix Salten, was also a book for children.

In 1986, when he was 84 years old, Fles stopped working. He went back to the Netherlands, and lived three years in a home for retired artists. He died on December 19, 1989 at the age of 87.




These German poetry books were published by Barthold Fles Verlag, New York

Folder (computing)

When talking about file systems, a folder (also called directory, or catalog) is a way to organize computer files. A folder is a storage space, or container, where many files can be placed into groups and organize the computer. A folder can also contain other folders. For many computer software applications, there is a current working directory. This is the folder that the application runs in. In Unix and Linux, a directory is a special type of file.

Folders can be put together to make a "filesystem" and are laid out like a tree. The folders inside folders are like branches and sub-branches off the tree trunk. This idea is used by the software to allow the user to navigate the folders. A computer file, such as a spreadsheet or music file can only be in one folder directly. This folder, however, can be inside other folders. On some operating systems, shortcuts or links can be made from one folder to another to make it appear that one file or folder is contained in two different parent folders. On Unix systems, this is called a "symbolic link", and is similar in function to a hyperlink.

Folders are inspired by a real-life item called a file folder.

Computer icon

An icon, when talked about in computing, is a picture which usually stands for a computer program, computer file, folder, or an action for a program to do. Icons are usually small pictures, but not always. Sometimes the user can change what size an icon is.

Icons are used in many places on a computer. The desktop contains icons as shortcuts - clicking on these icons opens up the file, folder, or application that they stand for. For example, in Microsoft Windows the desktop will often have an icon for the Recycle Bin, and the icon usually looks like a trash can in the dextstop.

Shortcut icons also show up in other places such as folders and the start menu. These icons work the same as on the desktop.

Many computer programs use icons on "buttons". When the user clicks on the button, something happens. For example, a button with an icon of a printer will usually help the user print what is currently open. While a button with a magnifying glass will let the user search for something.

Portulacaceae

Portulacaceae is a family of flowering plants, comprising about 20 genera with about 500 species, ranging from herbaceous plants to shrubs.

Peter Grimes

Peter Grimes is an opera by Benjamin Britten. It was first performed in 1945. It is generally thought to be the most important British opera of the 20th century. It is about a community in a small fishing village in the east of England in the 1820s. Peter Grimes is a fisherman who feels that the people do not want to have anything to do with him. He wants to make lots of money so that he can marry and get people’s respect. In his obsession with catching as much fish as possible he is cruel to the boys who help him (his apprentices), and they die. At the end of the opera Grimes drowns himself.

Britten wrote the main part (Peter Grimes) for his life partner Peter Pears to sing.

There are three acts, and the opera starts with a prologue and ends with an epilogue. Some of the scenes are joined by continuous music, and some of this is often played separately in concerts. This music is known as the Four Sea Interludes.

When World War II started Britten and Pears went to America to avoid the war. In 1941 Britten started to feel homesick because he read an article by E.M.Forster about George Crabbe, a poet who had lived in the same part of England that Britten came from. Britten started to realize that, in order to compose well, he had to go back to his own country. Britten and Pears returned to England in 1942.

The conductor Sergei Koussevitzky asked Britten to write an opera based on a poem by George Crabbe. The poem, called “The Borough”, was about the story of Peter Grimes. The village in the poem was fictitious, but it was very much like Aldeburgh where Britten later made his home. Britten asked Montagu Slater to write the libretto based on the story of Crabbe’s poem.

The opera was first performed at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London on 7 June 1945 by the company which later became English National Opera. The conductor was Reginald Goodall. Pears sang the title role.

The first American performance was in 1946 at Tanglewood conducted by Koussevitzky's pupil, Leonard Bernstein. Britten dedicated it to Koussevitsky’s wife.

The first young boy who was an apprentice to Peter Grimes has already been killed. He was at sea for three days without water to drink. An inquest is being held to decide whether Grimes is guilty of the boy’s death. The people all seem to think he is guilty. The judge decides that the boy’s death was an accident. However, he says to Grimes that he should not get another apprentice. Grimes is very angry at being told this. Ellen Orford, a school teacher, comforts him. In their beautiful duet Ellen and Peter sing at first in different keys, but finally sing together in the same key.

The scenery shows the Moot Hall, the Boar Inn (the village pub) and the church. People are saying “Good morning” to one another, especially the Slave Master who says it many times. The fishermen start work mending their nets. Keene tells Grimes that he has found another apprentice for him. He is a poor boy who lives in the workhouse. Nobody wants Grimes to have another apprentice. Hobson, the cart man, refuses to fetch him. But Ellen supports Peter. She sings to the crowd: “Let her among you without fault cast the first stone” (meaning: “You all have faults so do not criticize”). Hobson goes off to get the boy. A terrible storm is coming.

The scene now changes to The Boar Inn. It is very noisy inside. Bob Boles gets drunk and wants to make love to the landlady’s nieces. The storm is still raging outside. Grimes comes in. People are shocked, but Grimes does not notice. He sings and song about human fate: “Now the Great Bear and Pleiades”. The tune is in the orchestra in canon while Grimes sings very simple lines of music. People are embarrassed, so they start to sing a round: “Old Joe has gone fishing”. It has three tunes and has seven counts in a bar. The boy is brought in and Grimes takes him off in spite of the storm.
The opening of the next act is peaceful. It is Sunday morning. People are in church, and now again we hear the singing coming from the church. Ellen talks to the boy. She is horrified to see he has a bruise on his neck. Grimes says it was an accident. He gets annoyed that Ellen is worried about the boy and runs off with him. The people of the village have noticed and march up to Grimes’s hut. The scene ends with a peaceful contrast: a duet sung by the two nieces.

The orchestra play a beautiful passacaglia which links to the next scene. Grimes is accusing the boy of “telling stories”. Then he starts to feels guilty about the first boy’s death. He hears the villagers coming and tells the boy they have to go fishing. He pushes him out onto the rocks and the boy falls to his death. When the villagers arrive at the hut they find it empty.

Act 3 opens with music describing moonlight at night. People are dancing in the Moot Hall. People are very merry. Mrs. Sedley tries to tell people that Grimes is a murderer, but they do not listen. People then start to leave, saying “Goodnight” to one another (especially the Rector). Balstrode is walking with Ellen. He tells her that Grimes’s boat is in, but Grimes cannot be found. A boy’s jersey has been washed up on the shore. Ellen sings an aria “Embroidery in childhood was a luxury of idleness”. It is a moment of stillness in the drama.

A short interlude based on one chord leads to the next scene in which people are looking for Grimes. Grimes drags himself onto the shore. He seems to have gone mad. We hear a foghorn (played by an off-stage tuba) as he sings. Balstrode tells Grimes that he should go out to sea in his boat and sink it.

The opera ends with an epilogue in which the scene is the same as the beginning of the opera. Someone says that a boat has been seen sinking out to sea, but no one is interested. The people have forgotten Grimes, and continue their lives without him.

Tanggula Railway Station

Tanggula railway station is a railway station on the Qingzang railway in Tibet. It is in Amdo County. Tibet is currently an Autonomous Region inside China. At an altitude of 5,068 meters above sea level it is said to be the highest train station in the world. The next higher station outside China was Ticlio station in (Peru), at 4,829 m.

In 2009, the station was closed, but there are plans to make special trains for tourists stop there.

Tanggula railway station is less than one kilometre from Tanggula Pass which is the highest point of the Qingzang railway. That point is 5,072 meters above sea level. 

There are no staff at the station, which opened for service on July 1, 2006. Some say that the railway was built to help China control the people of Tibet.

There are three railway tracks at the station. Two of them can be accessed by a platform. The platforms are 1.25km long. The place where the station was built was specially selected for the view it offers. 

In 2008, Tangula Railtours will launch a tourist train service from Beijing to Lhasa through the pass. Three specially-built luxury trains will be used for the service.

Symptoms of mesenteric ischemia include:


Trix (cereal)

Trix is a brand of breakfast cereal. It is made by General Mills for North America and Cereal Partners in other parts of the world. They are vanilla-flavored puffed cereal pieces. They were first round, brightly colored cereal pieces. In 1991, they were changed to puffed fruit-shaped pieces. In 2006, they were changed back to their round shape in the United States and some other places. In the present, the slogan says: "Trix is not for rabbits!".

When the cereal was first made in 1955, it originally had three flavors: "Orangy Orange", "Raspberry Red", and "Lemony Yellow". Between 1984 and 1999, five more flavors were added: "Grapity(/Berry) Purple(/Grape)" (1984), "Lime Green" (1991), "Wildberry(/Redberry(/Red Wild Cherry and Blueberry)) Blue( and Red(/ Split))" (1998-2006), "Watermelon Green" (1999) and "Bananaberry(/Banana Yellow and Strawberry Red) Split(/Red( and Yellow))" (2003). Yoplait-brand yogurt, made by General Mills, makes Trix Yogurt. It has flavors such as "Watermelon Burst". A different type of Trix cereal called "Trix Swirls" is made also. It is made of puffed pieces with different colored swirls.

Harry Patch

Henry "Harry" Patch (born 17 June 1898 - 25 July 2009) was a World War I veteran and the last soldier of the war to die who fought in the trenches.

Patch fought in the trenches in World War I. He became a plumber and firefighter. He never talked to anybody about his experiences in the trenches. When he was 100 years old he decided he should tell people about what he had seen in the war. He still had 11 more years to live after that. When he died at the age of 111 he was the last British person who had fought in the First World War. This is why he was known as "the Last Tommy". For the last seven days of his life he was the oldest man in Europe. He did not want to have a state funeral. The funeral was at Wells Cathedral. A very large number of people came. They were mostly ordinary people, but there were also some important people including Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. For many of the people there it was a last opportunity to pay respects to the people who fought in the war.

Harry decided to talk about his experiences because he wanted everyone to realize how terrible wars are. When he talked to the BBC he said: "...if any man tells you he went over the top and he wasn't scared, he's a damn liar." In the same series, he talked about his friends who were killed, and about the moment when he came face to face with a German soldier. He remembered the Bible story about Moses coming down from Mount Sinai with God's commandment, 'thou shalt not kill'. He could not bring himself to kill the German. Instead, he shot him in the shoulder, which made him drop his rifle. But the German carried on running towards Patch's gun, so he then shot him above the knee, and in the ankle. Patch said, "I had about five seconds to make the decision. I brought him down, but I didn't kill him."

Patch was born and died in Somerset. In his last years he lived in a nursing home in Wells where he died on 25 July 2009 from natural causes, he was 111 years old. He died just seven days after the death of Henry Allingham, aged 113, who had been the only other remaining British-resident First World War veteran. Harry Patch received eight medals.

Tommy Atkins

Tommy Atkins (often just Tommy) is a term for a common soldier in the British Army. The term was used in the 19th century, but it is particularly associated with World War I.

French and Commonwealth troops would also call British soldiers "Tommies".

Harry Patch, who died aged 111 on 25 July 2009 was known as the "Last Tommy" because he was the last surviving British soldier who fought in World War I.

Henry Allingham

Henry Allingham (born London, 6 June 1896 - 18 July 2009) was a British supercentenarian and a First World War veteran. He was an engineer for most of his life. For the last month of his life he was the oldest living man in the world (according to official records). He became the oldest man ever in Britain.

Allingham was born on 6 June 1896 in Clapton, London, England. Henry went to a London County Council school and then the Regent Street Polytechnic. Allingham remembered seeing the City Imperial Volunteers return from the Second Boer War, and watching W. G. Grace play cricket. He Joined the Royal Naval Air Service in 1915. He became an Air Mechanic First Class. Most of his life he was an engineer. He designed new car bodies for the Ford Motor Company in Dagenham.

Allingham was the oldest ever member of any of the British Armed Forces and the oldest veteran of the First World War. He was the last survivor of the Battle of Jutland, the last surviving member of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and the last surviving founding member of the Royal Air Force. He was a member of the World War One Veterans' Association. 

Between his 110th and 111th birthdays Allingham made over 60 public appearances, including a visit to The Oval on 5 June 2007 (the day before his 111th birthday), where he was wheeled around the boundary in front of the spectators. James Sisnett later surpassed Allingham's record and later became the second oldest man in the world. 

With the help of Denis Goodwin, he wrote a book about his life. It was published on 23 September 2008. 

Allingham planned to leave his body to medical science. Allingham said that Denis Goodwin persuaded him to change his mind, because he had become a symbol of the war. So he had a funeral and cremation.

Henry Allingham had four medals, two of which were from the First World War.

Allingham died on 18 July 2009 in his home in Ovingdean, East Sussex from natural causes, aged 113. A funeral service was held for Allingham at the San Nicolas Church. 

The BBC asked Carol Ann Duffy, the Poet laureate, to write a poem to mark the deaths of Allingham and Harry Patch (who died one week after Allingham on 25 July 2009).

A plaque was placed next to Allingham's home to honor his longevity record in Ovingdean, West Sussex. 

Milgram experiment

The Milgram experiment is the name for a number of controversial experiments in psychology. They were done by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s. Milgram wanted to find out how easy it was to get someone to follow orders, even if the orders went against their conscience. In his experiment, a test subject was ordered by a scientist to inflict electric shocks on another person, though the shocks were faked.

To his surprise, most subjects did as they were told until the very end of the experiment, though many found it difficult. There have been many repetitions and variations of the experiment, with similar results.
Participants were told they would be helping out in a "learning experiment". The participant played the role of a "teacher" in which they had to ask questions to the "learner". Every time the learner got a question wrong or failed to answer, the teacher had to press a switch to give the learner an electric shock. The voltage increased each time. In the original version of the experiment, the teacher and learner were in separate rooms, but could talk to each other through the wall.

In fact, the electric shocks were faked. The "learners" were actually actors, who only pretended to be in pain. As the "shocks" increased, their cries of pain grew louder. They protested, banged the wall and stopped answering the questions. The shocks eventually reached levels that would have been deadly had they been real. At this point, the learner fell silent.

Much was done to trick the subjects into thinking it was real. When they arrived, they were told that the actor was another volunteer and that the "teacher" and "learner" roles would be decided at random by drawing slips of paper. In fact, both slips of paper said "teacher", so the actor pretended to have picked "learner". The electric shock machine made buzzing noises and could give an actual mild shock of 45 volts. The teacher would try this out before the experiment began.

If at any time the subject ("teacher") wanted to stop the experiment, the experimenter had instructions on what to say to them. These were known as "verbal prods". The prods the experimenter had to use were, in this order:
There were a few other things the experimenter was allowed to say. For example, if the subject asked about whether the learner would be badly hurt, the experimenter could say "Although the shocks may be painful, there is no permanent tissue damage, so please go on."

If the subject still wished to stop after the four main prods had been used, the experiment was halted. Otherwise, it was halted after the subject had given the maximum "450-volt" shock three times in succession.

Before Milgram did his experiment, he asked fourteen Yale University psychology students what they thought the results would be. On average, the students thought that 1.2% of the "teachers" would give the biggest electric shock of 450 volts. In fact, in Milgram's first set of experiments, "65 percent" (26 of 40) of participants gave the final massive 450-volt shock, and all gave a shock of at least 300 volts.

Milgram found that the "teachers" showed signs of stress and nervousness in the experiment. Signs of this included sweating, trembling, stuttering and groaning. All of them stopped to question the experiment at some point. Most continued once they were reassured by the experimenter.

Other psychologists did their own versions of Milgram's experiment and found very similar results.

After repeating the original experiment, Milgram and other scientists tried different variations. These included:

Milgram wrote about the experiment in his book "Obedience to Authority: an experimental view". It was published in 1974. Milgram offered two theories:
Other factors might partly explain the Milgram experiments:

Some researchers argued that the experiments do not fully answer the question as to why apparently normal people commit atrocities in wartime. For example, the subjects were being told that the shocks would cause no major harm to the learner, whereas those who caused events like the Holocaust knew full well that they were committing murder.

The experiment has been mentioned numerous times in pop culture. In the graphic novel "V for Vendetta" Dr. Surridge said that she lost faith in humanity because of the experiment. In 2013 there was a conference about it at Nipissing University in Canada. The Milgram effect was mentioned in the movie "" in passing,

Page-boy

A page or page boy is a young male servant. A different meaning of "page boy", but based on the same idea of one who serves, is for a young boy who helps the bride at a wedding.

In medieval times, a page was a servant to a knight. He had to clean things, help the knight, for example by running messages for him. He also learned how to fight. When he was 14 he usually became a squire. When he was 21 he sometimes became a knight.

During the Renaissance and after it became fashionable for black boys and young men to be decorative pages. They wore fancy costumes and served fashionable ladies and lords. This custom of having an "African page" lasted for several centuries. This type of page is almost unheard of today. 

Gambit

A gambit is a chess opening involving a sacrifice, usually a pawn. The player, usually White, sacrifices (gives away) a pawn or more to develop faster and get an attack against the king. Gambits are also used to control the center of the chess board for better development of pieces. The player who plays the Gambit hopes for a development advantage against the opponent. There are a few gambits that require more valuable pieces for a better chance of winning. An example:

In modern times gambits are usually not for direct attacks on the king. They aim at 'positional' advantages, such as freer play for the pieces. A well-known example is the Benko Gambit: 

In return for his pawn, Black gets open lines for his bishops and his rook on a8.

Carlos Clos Gómez

Carlos Clos Gomez is a football referee from Zaragoza, Spain. He is a UEFA class 2 referee as of January 2009.

Clos Gomez refereed a Europa League match between Motherwell F.C. and Steaua Bucharest in which he was criticised by Motherwell manager Jim Gannon.

In 2008, Clos Gomez was forced to abandon a match between Real Betis and Atletico Bilbao after a player was struck by a bottle thrown from the crowd.

On 13th March 2010, FC Barcelona's coach Josep Guardiola accused Clos Gomez of lying on the final report.

Free fall

Free fall is what happens when an object is let to fall on its own without propulsion or resistance. Someone who is standing is not in free fall, but someone jumping from an aeroplane is, until air resistance builds up, ending in terminal velocity. An artillery shell is in free fall from the time it is fired until it hits something. Even the time when it is going up is free fall. Space stations and spacecraft are in free fall when their engine is not on and they are not sitting somewhere, which means all or most of the time. For Earth the acceleration due to gravity (g) is 9.81 Newton (unit) per kilogram.

Essjay controversy

The Essjay controversy is about a well known Wikipedia administrator and salaried Wikia worker, Essjay, who later said he was Ryan Jordan.

In February 2007, Essjay was discovered to have made false claims about his school certificates and job experiences on his Wikipedia user page and to news reporter Stacy Schiff during a report for "The New Yorker".

Many people reacted in many ways to the controversy. Many articles and comments were made in electronic, print, and broadcast media; the Wikipedia community checked Essjay's article changes to check for errors and debated proposals to improve the project's handling of personal identification. In his activities as an editor, Essjay had spent less time changing the content of articles and more time addressing vandalism and resolving editorial disputes.

Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales supported Essjay's use of an identity, saying, "I regard it as a pseudonym and I don’t really have a problem with it." Later Wales changed his opinion and asked for Essjay to quit his jobs with Wikipedia and Wikia. Wales stated that he withdrew his support when he learned "that EssJay used his false credentials in content disputes" on Wikipedia.

Stacy Schiff, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter writing for "The New Yorker", interviewed Essjay as a source for an article about Wikipedia. ("Know It All"; July 31, 2006) He was suggested for this to her by a member of the Wikimedia Foundation. "The New Yorker", said Essjay "was willing to describe his work as a Wikipedia administrator but would not identify himself other than by confirming the biographical details that appeared on his user page."

During the interview, Jordan told "The New Yorker" and had said on his Wikipedia user page that he had doctoral degrees in theology and canon law. He also said he worked as a tenured professor at a private university. It was later found that he was 24 years old and had quit community college with no qualifications. "The New Yorker" published a correction in February 2007, which brought the issue to broader public attention.

The article said that Essjay was on Wikipedia some 14 hours or more a day. The article also said he was careful to keep his online life a secret from his co-workers and friends. Essjay was pictured as taking his laptop to class so he could be available to other Wikipedians while giving a quiz. He said that he needed anonymity to avoid cyberstalking.

Essjay said that he had sent an email to a college professor using his false persona's credentials, telling for Wikipedia's accuracy. In the message he wrote in part, "I am an administrator of the online encyclopedia project Wikipedia. I am also a tenured professor of theology; feel free to have a look at my Wikipedia userpage (linked below) to gain an idea of my background and credentials."

When Essjay was hired by Wikia in January 2007, he made changes to his Wikia profile and "came clean on who he really was," showing himself as Ryan Jordan. Other Wikipedia editors asked Essjay questions on his Wikipedia talk page about the difference between his new Wikia profile and his previously claimed credentials. Essjay posted a reason in response to the first question, saying that:

He later said on his Wikipedia user page about having fooled Schiff by "doing a good job playing the part."

Social activist and Wikipedia critic Daniel Brandt then told "The New Yorker" about the difference in profiles. In late February 2007 the magazine updated its article with a change (correction) saying that "Essjay now says that his real name is Ryan Jordan, that he is twenty-four and holds no advanced degrees, and that he has never taught."

On March 3, 2007, Andrew Lih, Assistant Professor and Director of Technology Journalism and of the Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong, said on his blog that a part of Essjay's comments on the incident entered "the dangerous domain of defamation and libel" against Stacy Schiff. Lih quoted Essjay as writing on his Wikipedia talk page: "Further, she [Schiff] made several offers to compensate me for my time, and my response was that if she truly felt the need to do so, she should donate to the Foundation instead." Lih noted:

Lih wrote that he contacted Schiff for comment about whether she had offered to pay Essjay for his time and quoted her return email. In it Schiff said that Essjay's statement was "complete nonsense."

Talking about Jordan, Wales said, "Mr. Ryan was a friend, and still is a friend. He is a young man, and he has offered me a heartfelt personal apology, which I have accepted. I hope the world will let him go in peace to build an honorable life and reputation".
Essjay had said in reply at the time with a statement on his Wikipedia page, in part saying:

Reaction from inside the Wikipedia community to the Essjay/Jordan identity difference was pointed. There were many comments. While most editors opposed at least some of his actions, responses ranged from offering complete support to accusing Jordan of fraud.

As the controversy went further, the Wikipedia community began looking at Essjay's previous changes. Some felt he had relied upon his false professorship to prove he was right about his changes. "People have gone through his edits and found places where he was basically cashing in on his fake credentials to bolster his arguments," said Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator and founder of the Wikipedia community newspaper, "The Wikipedia Signpost". "Those will get looked at again." For instance, Essjay had recommended sources such as "Catholicism for Dummies," a book granted the nihil obstat and imprimatur by the Roman Catholic Church. Essjay defended his use of the book by telling fellow Wikipedia editors in a disagreement over the editing of the article Imprimatur: "This is a text I often require for my students, and I would hang my own PhD on it’s credibility."
Wales was "...reported to be considering vetting all persons who adjudicate on factual disputes." "I don't think this incident exposes any inherent weakness in Wikipedia, but it does expose a weakness that we will be working to address," Wales added. He insisted that Wikipedia editors still would be able to remain anonymous if they wished. "We always prefer to give a positive incentive rather than absolute prohibition, so that people can contribute without a lot of hassle", Wales commented. However, he also warned that "It's always inappropriate to try to win an argument by flashing your credentials, and even more so if those credentials are inaccurate". Wales argued "contributors to the site who claim certain credentials will soon have to prove they really have them." However, Florence Devouard, chair of the Wikimedia Foundation, was not supportive of his credential suggestion, saying, "I think what matters is the quality of the content, which we can improve by enforcing policies such as 'cite your source,' not the quality of credentials showed by an editor." A formal suggestion that users saying to have qualification would have to give something to prove they really do have them, before using them was rejected by the Wikipedia community, like all previous such suggestions.

As a follow-up to his first comments to "The New Yorker", Wales wrote this apology to the magazine, which showed in its March 19, 2007 issue:

Wales stated his regret that Essjay had "made a series of very bad judgments." He said he hopes the Wkipedia would be better off from the controversy.

Andrew Orlowski, a Wikipedia critic and writer for "The Register"—a British technology news and opinion website—criticized Jimmy Wales for hiring Essjay at the venture-capital-funded 'Wikia' and for making him a member on the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee. Essjay had admitted his stated academic and professional credentials were false before he was made a member. Orlowski added that Essjay's actions showed a harmful community way of thinking inside Wikipedia.

Others to comment negatively included ZDNet writer Mitch Ratcliffe. Ratcliffe asked "why lying about one's background qualifies a person to work for a company like Wikia, which proposes to help communities to record accurate information" and asked for additional details "such as when he fired Jordan and the reasons for the firing, as well as when he endorsed Jordan in public statements."

Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief of online encyclopedia Citizendium, and a co-founder of Wikipedia who quit the project in 2002, called Essjay's response "a defiant non-apology" and elsewhere stated Essjay's actions as "identity fraud."
Showing comments by Essjay on his Wikipedia talk pages, Sanger stated that other members of Wikipedia management, including Angela Beesley (co-founder of Wikia and a member of Wikimedia Foundation's Communications Committee) and Brad Patrick (legal counsel for the Wikimedia Foundation) had worked in hiring Jordan when they knew of the identity difference. Sanger also made note that Jordan's dismissal was the result of public response. That "Only after these sad facts were publicly made aware, only after there was a response, did Jimmy Wales decide to ask for Essjay’s to quit."

Other comments:

Following the media broadcast of the Essjay controversy, a number of people noted the damage to the credibility of Wikipedia. On March 2, 2007, a report in "The Chronicle of Higher Education" commented "the incident is clearly damaging to Wikipedia's credibility—especially with professors who will now note that one of the site's most visible academics has turned out to be a fraud." Ross Brann, a professor of Judeo-Islamic classes at Cornell University in Ithaca, stated that Wikipedia is without a way to expertly review, saying, "They could make up your life if they wanted to." Brann also said that Wikipedia "has no place in the University," and he believed the Essjay incident would do nothing to change the negative opinion that academics generally hold about the online encyclopedia. Students at Cornell stated that they may continue to use Wikipedia as a quick source of information, though they would not cite it in scholarly work.

Cernunnos

Cernunnos (also spelt as Cernenus and Cern) is a Pagan Celtic God from the ancient Celtic lands of western Europe.

Cernunnos is linked with male animals with horns, especially stags (a type of animal). Because of this, he is linked with fertility. Cernunnos is also seen as God of the Underworld.

Everything that we know about Cernunnos comes from two pictures; one from France, and one from Germany.

Gameplay of Pokémon

The gameplay of the Pokémon series of role-playing video games involves catching and training fictional creatures called "Pokémon" and using them to battle other trainers. Every generation of games follows this concept by introducing new Pokémon, items, and gameplay concepts. Some of the general concepts were featured elsewhere before being introduced in the games; double battles appeared in the anime long before appearing in the games, and Pokémon abilities are similar to the Pokémon Powers introduced in the "Pokémon Trading Card Game".

Battling is a large part of the games. Pokémon can be found in the wild, in dark grass, caves, forests, ponds, the ocean, and even underwater. Whenever the player walks where another trainer can see them, the two must battle. Hundreds of trainers are in each of the main series "Pokémon" games.

Pokémon have six statistics (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) which affect how they perform in battles. Statistics can be raised by using items and by training the Pokémon.

Before "Pokémon Gold and Silver" were released, the "Special Attack" and "Special Defense" stats were combined into one statistic, "Special." This became too complicated so it was divided into "Special Attack" and "Special Defense."

Starting in "Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire", Pokémon have abilities which affect them in various ways. These can be abilities that work while in battle or when the player is just walking around. An example is the ability "Overgrow" which increases the power of Grass-type moves when a Pokémon's health is below 1/3 of its full amount.
Each Pokémon has either one or two types. Which types it has affect how it performs when it battles other Pokémon of other types. For example, a Fire-type Pokémon is weak against Water-type, but is strong against a Grass-type. It could be compared to a more complex game of rock, paper, scissors.

This is a list of the types:

Two more were added when "Pokémon Gold and Silver" were released:

Another type, "Fairy", was added in "Pokémon X and Y".

Pokémon Gyms are buildings where the player faces a Gym Leader, who focuses one of the 18 types of Pokémon. There are also trainers in the Gym that the player can battle, and they also use mostly that type. Beating the Gym Leader earns you a Badge which increases your skills.

Pokémon evolve into different Pokémon from the same evolutionary line. Doing so, they become stronger and can learn more powerful moves, but learn moves at higher levels.

This is the most common way that Pokémon evolve. Pokémon in this category evolve when they reach a certain level. 
Some Pokémon can only evolve by level in a certain place.
Some Pokémon evolve by level if it is holding a certain item.
Some Pokemon only evolve by level if they are leveled in a route that is having certain weather. This weather can only work to evolve the Pokemon if the weather is not caused by a move or Ability.

This is another way that Pokémon evolve. Some Pokémon can only evolve if they are given certain evolution stones.

This is another way that Pokémon evolve. Some Pokémon only evolve if they are traded to a friend. 
Some Pokémon only evolve if traded to a friend while holding an item.
Some Pokemon only evolve if they're traded with another, specific Pokemon.

Another way Pokémon evolve is through happiness. Whenever the player character in the game walks 100 steps, gives their Pokémon a vitamin such as Protein, Iron, Carbos, Calcium, or Zinc, training it until it gains a level, or when the character does something else to make it happy, it will gain happiness points. The item Soothe Bell multiplies this amount. Once a Pokémon has reached a certain happiness level, it will evolve after it is leveled once, sometimes depending on the time of day:

Eevee evolves into either Espeon or Umbreon if its happiness rating is maxed out; into Espeon if this happens during the day, or Umbreon if it happens during the night. This day-and-night distinction exists only in the second-generation games and the generations that follow (but not in "Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen").

Pokémon can evolve after learning certain moves and leveling up.


Some Pokémon can evolve only if they are a certain gender.


Some Pokémon can evolve into a Mega form during a battle if they are holding a Mega Stone. The evolution only lasts for the battle.

A large number of different items exist. They are used to help the player or their Pokémon.

A Poké Ball is a red-and-white sphere that is used to catch Pokémon. Many different forms of it exist, such as the Great Ball, the Ultra Ball, the Heavy Ball, the Net Ball, the Dive Ball, the Friend Ball, and the Master Ball (which can catch any Pokémon without fail). Each of these have different colors and can be used to catch different Pokémon more effectively.

The Pokédex is a tool used by Pokémon trainers all around the Pokémon world in different regions. These regions include the Unova region, the Sinnoh region, the Hoenn region, the Johto region and the Kanto region. The Pokédex makes records of information about each of the different Pokémon. There are 801 different species of Pokémon recorded in the world today. Different Pokémon are caught in different regions and some Pokémon can only be caught in certain regions, such as Xerneas in the Kalos Region.

Legendary Pokémon are Pokémon that are very rare, and there is usually only one in each game. Examples of legendaries are Articuno, Zapdos, Mewtwo, Lugia, Groudon, and Dialga. They are hard to catch, and are stronger than most Pokémon. Some roam around, while others can be found in one spot until you KO or capture them. If you KO a legendary, it will usually leave and will never be found again unless the game is restarted or the Elite Four is defeated again. Because of this, players usually save before engaging the Pokémon.

Mythical Pokémon are the rarest type of Pokémon, only found by one-time events. Examples of Mythical Pokémon are Mew, Celebi, and Jirachi.

Shiny Pokémon are a different color than that Pokémon normal for their species. Some examples would be a yellow Bulbasaur (they are usually greenish-blue) or a red Gyarados (they are usually blue). They are extremely rare; there is only a 1 in 4,096 chance of an encountered Pokémon being shiny, but there are ways to improve your chances of obtaining one, which vary per game. Some Pokemon in the same evolution line have different shiny colors, even if their regular colors are the same. For example, Ponyta and Rapidash normally have reddish-orange flames. However, shiny Ponyta have blue flames while shiny Rapidash have silver flames.

Mudkip

Mudkip is a character of the Pokémon anime and video game series. Known as the Mud Fish Pokémon, Mudkip first appeared in 2003 in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, as one of three starter Pokémon the player can choose from at the beginning of the games. Mudkip and members of its evolution family dwell in swamps or other wetlands, deep inside isolated islands, because of their dislike of fresh water lakes and ponds. Mudkip have appeared on the boxart for "", "", "Pokémon Channel", and "Pokémon Dash".

They are small blue Pokémon with a large fin on their head that allows them to sense movements within the air and water, acting as a radar. While in the water, they use the orange, spiky gills on their cheeks to breathe while using their large tail fin to propel themselves. They are extremely strong, despite their small bodies; they are able to lift or crush large boulders. When sleeping, they bury themselves within the soil at the edge of the water. Mudkip and members of its evolution family dwell in swamps or other wetlands, deep inside isolated islands, because of their dislike of fresh water lakes and ponds.

Mudkip is one of the three starter pokemon, along with Treeko and Torchic, in "Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire". Mudkip undergo evolution, a metamorphic change within a Pokémon caused by gaining experience in battle and growing up in terms of levels, in which they can evolve into Marshtomp, and again into Swampert. They are not available in later games "Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen" and "Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum" except through trade.

Mudkip have made cameo appearances in the Game Boy Advance game "" (a sequel of the Game Boy Color game "Pokémon Pinball"); they have also starred in the Nintendo GameCube games "Pokémon Channel", "Pokémon Colosseum", and "". They are featured in Nintendo DS games "Pokémon Dash", "Pokémon Ranger", "Pokémon Mystery Dungeon" and "Pokémon Trozei", as well as being featured on the boxart for many of these. Mudkip appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a trophy that can be obtained through special means.

In the "Pokémon" anime, Brock, a Pokémon breeder and former Gym leader, obtains a Mudkip on Dewford Island. As Ash Ketchum and his companions climb a waterfall, they come across a group of young Mudkip. Brock rescues one of the Mudkip from being washed away in a stream. Brock's Lotad and Mudkip work together to defeat Team Rocket, at which point the Mudkip decides to join Brock's team. Mudkip's primary role is to assist Brock during water related situations, such as searching for objects in the ocean, such as an Illumise and a pearl belonging to a Spoink. Mudkip also guides the Pokémon when Brock, Ash and May aren't around. It evolves into Marshtomp during a training battle versus Ash's Grovyle. A separate Mudkip also appears when the group meet a trainer called Nicolai, a young trainer, who is training his first Pokémon, Mudkip, which later defeats May's Torchic in a battle. Nicolai connects with his Pokémon in battle by dressing up in a suit resembling his Pokémon, wearing both Mudkip and Zigzagoon outfits in the episode.

In the manga "Pokémon Adventures" during the arc based off of "Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire", Ruby, the male protagonist, obtains a Mudkip named Zuzu as his starter Pokémon from Professor Birch. Ruby becomes a Pokémon coordinator, a person who uses their Pokémon for contests rather than battles, and uses Zuzu in those contests. At the beginning Ruby was dissaponted with it because it wasn't pretty enough like his other Pokémon, but then he decided that Tough Contests would be perfect for it. Zuzu was first used to battle against Sapphire, Ruby's rival in the manga. Zuzu evolved into a Marshtomp unexpectedly while Ruby was in Slateport City, and again into a Swampert, while training near Fortree City.

In the "Pokémon Trading Card Game", Mudkip is a Water-type Basic Pokémon, just like its video game counterparts. As a Basic Pokémon, it can be played in a battle, as the competitions of the card game are called, without the use of a special card. If the player has a Marshtomp card in their hand, they can play it on top of the Mudkip card, which is the card game's equivalent of evolving. Mudkip has appeared in the sets "EX Ruby & Sapphire", "EX Dragon", and "EX Emerald". It also appears in "EX Team Rocket Returns", but as "Mudkip Star". This card is different to the other Mudkip cards, because it is the rarest in the set.
Mudkip is the inspiration for an internet meme called "so I herd u like mudkips". Originating on another website, members of 4chan adopted it as an in-joke. Since then, the meme has grown steadily, now including thousands of Youtube videos in tribute and has been named by the "Wall Street Journal" as one of 4Chan's "Greatest Hits". On April 1, 2008, DeviantART played an April Fool's Day joke on its members, changing all their users avatars to images of Mudkip.

GameFAQs's sixth and seventh annual character battles featured Mudkip, with him losing in round one against Luigi and Mega Man X respectively.

Star Wars: Dark Forces

Star Wars: Dark Forces is a first-person shooter computer game which takes place in the "Star Wars" universe. It was made by LucasArts. It came out in 1995 for MS-DOS and Apple Macintosh, and a version was later made for Sony Playstation.

The player controls Kyle Katarn, who was once a stormtrooper for the Galactic Empire but left the Empire to become a mercenary. In "Dark Forces", Katarn works for the Rebellion which fights against the Empire. The game's story is about Kyle finding and stopping an Imperial weapons program called the Dark Trooper Project.

Everything in the game is set in the Star Wars universe. Many things in the game are taken from the original Star Wars trilogy movies, such as several weapons and most of the game's enemies, but some things were made just for "Dark Forces". 

Many of the planets that the levels take place on were created for Dark Forces, but a few of them are from "Star Wars" books. 

"Dark Forces" is a first person shooter, so the player controls Katarn and sees from Katarn's eyes. Much of the gameplay is about fighting and shooting enemies, but there are also many puzzles to solve to move through the missions. 

The player can run, strafe, jump, crouch, and move through shallow water. The player can also look up and down. The game can be controlled with keys on the keyboard, and also a mouse can be used to run, turn, and shoot. 

The game is made up of separate missions. Each mission has certain goals that the player must finish. The missions are all part of the story. Katarn's pilot drops him off and picks him up, but he goes through the missions alone without any help.

There are many different weapons in the game that the player can use and that enemies also use. Most of the weapons shoot blaster bolts or other projectiles, but the player can also throw "thermal detonators" like grenades. Some of the weapons have a "secondary" fire mode which shoots in a different way.

The story is told in two ways. One way is cutscenes, which are animated videos that play between some missions. Also, before each mission the player is given a briefing which talks about what is happening in the story and what the mission goals are.

In the first mission, Katarn steals the Death Star plans so the Rebels can destroy the Death Star. The rest of the game is a different story. 

The Rebels find out about a secret Imperial program called the Dark Trooper Project. The Dark Trooper project is a plot to create new robotic Stormtroopers that are very powerful and dangerous.

Kyle searches for clues about the Dark Trooper Project and sets off to stop it.

Club Atlético Independiente

Club Atlético Independiente is a professional football club from Buenos Aires Argentina. The club currently plays in Argentine Primera División. 

Chacarita Juniors

C.A. Chacarita Juniors is a football club which plays in Argentina.

C.A. Huracán

Club Atlético Huracán is a sports club from the Parque Patricios neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The football team currently plays in the Primera A, the first level of the Argentine football league system. Huracán home stadium is the Estadio Tomás Adolfo Ducó.

Huracán was founded on November 1, 1908, in the Nueva Pompeya neighbourhood of Buenos Aires. The club's name and nickname ("Globo", literally "Balloon") come from the "Huracán" balloon flied by Jorge Newbery in 1909. Apart from that, club supporters are called "los Quemeros" ("the Burners") because the stadium is in a former garbage burning area.

During the professional era, Huracán won the Primera División title just once (the 1973 Metropolitano), and obtained 4 titles during the amateur era (in 1921, 1922, 1925 and 1928). Moreover, Huracán has finished as runner-up of the first division 5 times during professionalism (the last one in the 2009 Clausura).

Huracán's historical rival is San Lorenzo de Almagro.

Though officially founded in 1908, there are documents that tell about a previous foundation on May 25, 1903. During the amateur era of Argentine football (1891–1930), Huracán won four championships (1921, 1922, 1925 and 1928). The team was the fifth most successful during that period.

During the professional era (started in 1931), Huracán had their moment of glory in the "Metropolitano" championship of the 1973 season, when they won their only first division title. The team has also won twice the second division (1989–90 and 1999–00). The club has had 4 promotions and relegations during their history. The last promotion came during the 2006–07 season, when Huracán defeated Godoy Cruz in the promotion playoffs.

Huracán was runner-up of the Primera División in the 2009 Clausura. The team, coached by Ángel Cappa and with Mario Bolatti, Matías Defederico and Javier Pastore as key players, was praised for their attacking short-pass style of play. They reached the final game of the season one point above Vélez Zársfield, but lost 1-0 away with that team in the final fixture (in a game with controversial referral decisions).

The Estadio Tomás Adolfo Ducó was closed in May 2008, after cracks were discovered in one of the structural columns. While the stadium was out of commission, Huracán played their home games at Argentinos Juniors. In August 2008, Fernando "la tota" Blauzwirn, an old player from the 1940s correctly said "no veo la hora de volver al Ducó, qué sufrimiento muyayo!" (I cannot wait until returning to the Duco, guys, what a suffering!).

On 13 December 2008 during the final weekend of the 2008-09 Apertura championship, Huracán returned to the Ducó, 438 days after they'd last played there. Their 3-0 victory against Vélez was the only game Huracan played at home during their centenary year.

Gresham's law

Gresham's law is commonly written: "Bad money drives out good."

If people want one thing ("good" money) more than the other ("bad" money), they will always offer the bad money in trade before the good money. Over time, the good money will be kept in pocket, and only the bad money will be found in the market. The law is named after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519-1579). Gresham founded the Royal Exchange in 1565. 

Silver coins were widely circulated in Canada (until 1968) and in the United States (until 1964 for dimes (ten cents) and quarters and 1970 for half dollars). However, these countries made their coins cheaper to make by switching to cheaper metals. The silver coins disappeared from circulation as people kept them for the value of their metal. The new coins had value as coins, but less value as metal.

The same process happens now with the copper content of coins such as the pre-1997 Canadian penny (one cent), the pre-1982 United States penny and the pre-1992 UK copper pennies and two pence.
This also occurred even with coins made of less expensive metals such as steel in India.

He became prime minister on 29 December 2022. He was also prime minister from 2009 to 2021 and before that from 1996 to 1999.

Netanyahu is leader of the HaLikud party and the first Israeli prime minister born after the establishment of the state of Israel. He is also the country’s longest-serving prime minister. From 2021 until 2022, he was Leader of the Opposition, which he also was from 2005 to 2009

The deal said that Gantz would be Vice Prime Minister until October 2021, by then he would replace Netanyahu to become Prime Minister.

In May 2021, Hamas fired rockets on Israel from Gaza, which caused Netanyahu to act Operation Guardian of the Walls, lasting eleven days.

After the 2021 Israel-Palestine crisis, Israeli politician and leader of the Yamina alliance Naftali Bennett announced that he has agreed to a deal with Yair Lapid to forge a coalition government that would remove Netanyahu from his Prime Minister position. This is after the 2021 March election.

After the 2022 election, Netanyahu was sworn in as Prime Minister again. He officially started his sixth term on 29 December 2022.

Quickie (sex)

A quickie is a brief act of sexual intercourse. People will not usually have much foreplay with a quickie.

A quickie may not always mean sexual intercourse. It may be oral sex or mutual masturbation. According to some, a quickie between a heterosexual couple generally satisfies only the man. Others claim that quickies (with intercourse or some other form of stimulation of the vulva) can also be "a major turn-on" for a woman. Since it may not give a woman enough time to lubricate naturally, she might need a lubricant. Some consider quickies a solution to unequal sexual desire in a relationship. If they become the only form of sex, the relationship may suffer. For gay men, a quickie sometimes means casual sex, like a hand job. It does not usually happen with lesbians, however.

Deep-throating

Deep throating is a form of fellatio, when an erect penis is placed inside a partner's mouth, deep enough to enter the throat. The person whose penis is inserted is normally referred as the receiving partner, and the person who performs deep-throating is referred to as the giving partner.

It is difficult for most people to perform deep-throating, because of the natural gag reflex that happens when the soft palate is touched. Different people have different sensitivities to the reflex, but some people learn to suppress the reflex. 

Usually, the giving partner's tongue is immobilized during deep-throating and they also are not able to suck.

The position of both partners is important in performing deep throat. For deep-throating, the giving partner's mouth and throat will need to be aligned (made into) into a straight line, and he or she will need to breathe through the nose. It is important for the giving partner to be in a position to control any pelvic thrust during deep-throating, to be able to pull the penis out if needed; and for the receiving partner not to thrust, as during irrumatio.

"Over-the-edge" is a common position for deep-throating. In this position, the giving partner lays on his/her back with the head hanging off the edge of the bed and the receiving partner stands or places himself on his knees in front of the giving partner, with his penis at the giving partner's mouth.

Another position used for deep-throating involves the giving partner sitting on the receiving partner's chest, with his feet or penis in front of the giving partner. 

The 69 position is another position for deep-throating.

Fisting

Fisting is a sexual activity. The fister puts his or her hand into the vagina or rectum. The fingers are then clenched into a fist or kept straight. Fisting may be done with or without a partner.

Fistees is another form of fisting. It is for the more experienced. It may take two fists. This is called double fisting. Double fisting pleasure depends more on stretching of the anus or vagina rather than thrusting with an in-and-out movement of the hands.

Fisting can cause lacerations to the vagina, perineum, rectum, and/or colon. This may result in serious injury. These lacerations may even lead to death. Sexual activities that cause air to enter the vagina can lead to a fatal air clot. The risk is probably even higher during pregnancy.

Fisting can cause cutting or tearing or of the vagina, perineum, rectum, and/or colon, resulting in serious injury and even death. In general, sexual activities that cause air to enter the vagina can lead to a fatal air clot, and the risk is probably even higher during pregnancy.

Anal fisting carries risks of colorectal tearing; people doing it should use latex gloves and lubricant, and have a safeword, which they can say when they want it to stop immediately. The practice, along with the insertion of hard objects into the anus or the vagina has been significantly related to the traumatization of the vaginal or rectal mucosa in increasing the likelihood of infection, including Hepatitis B virus.

Samuel Kuffour

Samuel Kuffour (born 3 September 1976) is a former Ghanaian football player. He has played for Ghana national team. He mostly played as a central defender , but was also used as a right full-back from time to time. He had his greatest successes with FC Bayern Munich, with whom he won, among other things, the Champions League once and the German championship and the DFB Cup several times. Known for his physical power, He was a rocky central defender, he was physically strong and skilled in tackling. Regarded as one of the best African defenders of all time, he is also considered to be one of the most decorated players in African football history.

Kuffour played for Fantomas Kumasi in his hometown from the age of seven to fourteen and moved to local rivals King Faisal Babes in 1990. In 1991 he got the chance to move abroad and joined the youth department of Torino FC. He played there for two years until FC Bayern Munich signed him. From 1993 to 2005 he played for the German record champions, and from 1994 in the first team. On October 29, 1994, Kuffour made his debut in a 2-2 home game against VfB Stuttgart, against whom he also scored his first Bundesliga goal on October 15, 1997 with the goal to make it 3-3. In retrospect, Kuffour described leaving his homeland early as a difficult step. Shortly before the second half of the 1995/96 season he was loaned to the second division club 1. FC Nürnberg until the end of the season. In January 2001, FC Barcelona showed great interest in the then 24-year-old, but Bayern manager Uli Hoeneß described the Ghanaian as “not for sale”. 

Kuffour achieved his greatest successes with FC Bayern: He lost the Champions League final against Manchester United in 1999, but won it in Milan in 2001 against FC Valencia. In the following World Cup game against their counterpart from South America, Boca Juniors , Kuffour contributed to the title win with his goal to make it 1-0 after extra time. He also won six German championships, the DFB Cup four times and the League Cup five times. In 175 Bundesliga games, the Ghanaian scored seven times in the opposing goal. After the signing of Lúcio in the summer of 2004, Kuffour was only the number five central defender behind Robert Kovač, Martin Demichelis, Thomas Linke and the Brazilian world champion. So an imminent departure became apparent. In December 2004, Middlesbrough FC 's interest in Kuffour became known, but a move did not materialize. 

For the 2005/06 season, Kuffour moved to the Italian first division club AS Roma, where he received a three-year contract. After a good start that saw Roma fans compare him to the Brazilian icon Aldair, things quickly went downhill. Kuffour played the 2006/07 season on loan at league rivals AS Livorno. He last played for Livorno in the European Cup.

After half a year without playing for AS Roma, Kuffour moved to the first division club Ajax Amsterdam in January 2008, where he was intended to replace the resigned Jaap Stam. Kuffour was unable to close the gap and left Ajax after just two appearances in six months. After a month without a club, the move to FK Khimki in the Russian Premier League was announced as fixed, which, however, turned out to be a newspaper duck ; As a result, Kuffour's agent Giuseppe dello Russo announced Kuffour's end to his career at the beginning of September 2008. Kuffour himself explained that he had just taken a break and was still looking for a new club. In April 2009 he signed a contract with Asante Kotoko, the then champions of the Ghana Premier League, where he finally ended his career after the three-month contract period had expired.

Kuffour was known for his consistency and reliability. On good days he was a world-class defender, on great days he was a threat to the team's success.

Kuffour played his first game for Ghana at the age of 17 against Sierra Leone . From March 5th to 20th, 1993 he took part in the U-20 World Cup in Australia, played six games until the final, which was lost 2-1 to Brazil, and scored on March 9th in the second group game (at 2:2 draw against Germany ) took the 1-0 lead and thus his only goal of the tournament. From August 21 to September 4, 1993, Kuffour took part in the U-17 World Cup in Japan. He played all games except the quarter-finals (1-0 win over Australia), but lost the final 1-2 against Nigeria.

Kuffour took part in the Olympic football tournament with the Olympic team in 1992 and 1996. In the first tournament, in the game for third place (1-0 win over Australia), he won the bronze medal with the team. He also took part in the African Championships in 1996, 1998, 2000 ( captain of the senior national team since 1999 ), 2002, 2006, with fourth place in 1996 being the national team's greatest success to date.

Kuffour also took part in the 2006 World Cup, where he made such a serious mistake in the first group game against Italy that he was then replaced in his position by Illiasu Shilla. When passing back to the own goalkeeper, the ball unfortunately reached striker Vincenzo Iaquinta, who was ready to take a shot, who made it 2-0 in the 83rd minute and gave his team the preliminary decision.

Chalcedonian Creed

The Chalcedonian Creed is a creed which was made during the Council of Chalcedon in the year 451. This council is one of the seven ecumenical councils. It is recognised by the Eastern Orthodox, the Catholics, and by many Protestant Churches. It is the first council the Oriental Orthodox Church does not recognize. 

The Chalcedonian creed was written during a controversy between the Western and Eastern Churches. They could not agree about the meaning of Incarnation, the influence of the emperor in the church, and the role of the Roman Pope. The Western Churches had no problems accepting the creed, but some Eastern Churches had.

The creed became doctrine in the Orthodox Church. The Coptic church of Alexandria disagreed. They used Cyril's formula instead. They said that the creed should say that Christ be acknowledged "from two natures" rather than "in two natures".

Kyneton

Kyneton is a town in central Victoria, Australia. In 2006 there were 5,905 people living in Kyneton.

It is seen in the games "Pokémon Diamond and Pearl", and in the movie "Lucario and the Mystery of Mew". In an interview with "Pokémon Diamond and Pearl" director Junichi Masuda, he said that Lucario's name was one of the hardest to make. This was because they wanted to make it work for both the Japanese and Americans.

Lucario is a human-like Pokémon that's around four feet in height. Lucario's hands are black and have one white spike on each arm on the top of its wrists, and there's a third spike on Lucario's chest. Lucario's nose and ears are longer since it evolved from Riolu. Lucario has a furry yellow body, and its hips are in the shape of what looks like blue shorts. It has the ability to sense the aura in all living things, and can use telepathic human speech. By catching the Aura coming from others, it can read their thoughts. A well-trained one can sense auras of creatures over half a mile away.

Lucario is a Pokémon that appears in the Nintendo DS versions of "Pokémon Diamond and Pearl"; Lucario is used by Maylene, the third Sinnoh Gym Leader, a tag-team partner known as Riley, and by Cynthia, Sinnoh's Elite Four Champion. In "Pokémon Mystery Dungeon" Lucario is seen as the greatest rescue leader of all time, and earning 15,000 Rescue Points will put the player in the top rank - the Lucario rank - and the Lucario statue will be put outside the rescue base.

It is a fighter in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and uses attacks like Aura Sphere, Force Palm, ExtremeSpeed, Double Team, and its final smash, Aura Storm. Lucario was confirmed to be a playable character in "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" due to a leak. After seeing their mistake they quickly fixed it. Lucario and Jigglypuff can no longer be seen but there are many YouTube videos which show proof of the leak, as well as screen shots.

In Pokémon X and Y, the player receives a free Lucario from Korrina. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Lucario using the Lucarionite.

Lucario's main role in the anime is his appearance in the eighth Pokémon movie, "Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew". In the movie, Lucario is a servant to Sir Aaron in a Renaissance-themed city called Cameron Palace. Aaron had trained this Lucario to use aura. Lucario thinks of Sir Aaron as both his master and close friend. After Aaron traps him in a magic staff at the film's start, Lucario begins questioning any Pokémon-human relationship. The Lucario in the movie, can also speak human languages without psychic powers. Lucario sacrificed himself in order to save the Tree of Beginning, though the credits showed him with Sir Aaron eating a chocolate bar.

Maylene in the anime, like in the games, has a Lucario and it was seen in four episodes. It was first seen battling with Maylene in their training. Lucario used Aura Sphere to stop the battle of Electabuzz, Piplup, and Pikachu, and is seen battling Paul's Pokémon in a flashback. Lucario was seen again where it battled in Dawn's gym battle with Maylene, where it defeated Dawn's Ambipom and Piplup. Then, in the next episode, it battled in Ash's gym battle against Maylene. It defeated Ash's Staravia and Chimchar, but was knocked out along with Ash's Buizel, which ended in a tie. Finaly, Lucario was seen when it helped Ash and the others defeat Saturn and Team Galactic.

In the Pokémon Adventures manga, like in games, it appears under the ownership of Riley who was on a boat heading to the Battle Frontier. Diamond meets Riley at Iron Island, and Byron asks Riley to help Diamond sharpen his Pokémon battle skills before Diamond goes to Lake Verity. In "Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Adventure!" the main character, Hareta, gained a Riolu egg which hatched into a Riolu later on in that chapter and then evolved in to Lucario.

UGO described Lucario as "a new breed of Pokémon, with a cooler, more dangerous look. It's quick and possesses a damaging set of attacks", yet called it lame due to its status as a Pokémon. IGN called its presence in "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" "a bit on the head scratching side" in light of more familiar characters in the title such as Pikachu. Although another editor stated that it would make sense for "Pokémon" to be represented by a fighting-type Pokémon, since "Super Smash Bros Brawl" is a fighting game. GamesRadar described it as an "all-around bad-ass" and "the Bruce Lee of Pokémon", suggesting its design as similar to the Egyptian God Anubis. Beckett "Pokémon" Unofficial Collector editor Sean Cooper stated that Lucario had grown popular in recent years due to his starring role in "Lucario and the Mystery of Mew" and his appearance in "Super Smash Bros. Brawl".

Hertzsprung–Russell diagram

The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is a graph of many stars. It shows the relation between stars' luminosity (how bright they are) and their temperature (how hot they are). 

These diagrams are not pictures or maps of where the stars are. Rather, Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams plot each star on a scatter graph showing the star's brightness versus its temperature. Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams are also called H-R diagrams or HRDs.

You can see an example of a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to the right. This diagram is based on measurements from 23,000 stars in our Milky Way galaxy. 

The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is named after its creators, astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell.

The vertical axis of a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram shows the luminosity or brightness of the stars, as if they were all measured from the same distance. Another term for this is absolute magnitude. The brighter a star is, the higher its plot will be on this chart.

The horizontal axis shows the surface temperature of the stars. However, the temperatures go "down", not up, as you move to the right. That is, the left of the diagram contains stars with the highest temperature plots (greater than 30,000 Kelvins) while the right shows stars with temperatures of only 3000K.

In general, the temperature of a star relates to its color. At the top of the chart, along with the temperatures, are the spectral classes. The hottest stars are blue-white (class O), those in the middle temperatures are yellow (class G) and the coolest ones are red (class M). When we say "coolest" about stars, the lowest temperature for a star is almost 5000 degrees Fahrenheit.

As a matter of fact, when Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams were developed in the early 1900's, astronomers did not know how to find out the temperature of a star. The first diagrams plotted stars' absolute magnitude against color, represented by the spectral classes from blue-white to red. 

As you can see, stars tend to fall only into certain regions of the diagram when graphed in this way. All stars in a given area of a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram share similar luminosities and temperatures. The main region where stars appear is the diagonal curved line, going from the upper-left (hot and bright) to the lower-right (cooler and less bright). This is called the Main Sequence. Above the main sequence is another region containing the red giants and supergiants. Below is a curved line representing the white dwarfs.

These collections of stars by brightness and temperature are important when talking about stellar evolution. In general, stars are created in the main sequence. (Of course, when we say ""in" the main sequence" we really mean "having a brightness and a temperature that causes them to be plotted within the main sequence on a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.") After billions of years, they expand into red giants. Then, after another one or two billion years, they shrink into white dwarfs.

It was only in the 1930's and 1940's that scientists began to understand the role of nuclear fusion in creating and keeping stars like our sun. These days Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams are used to present stellar evolution in pictures to students. They're not used much any more for developing new scientific theories.

On a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, our Sun is plotted very close to the middle of the main sequence at the intersection of luminosity 1 and temperature 5780K. Therefore, the Sun is class G or a "yellow star").


Seabird

Seabirds are birds that have adapted so they are better able to live at sea or near it. Many seabirds live "at sea", that is, far away from land. They may only come on land to breed. Other seabirds live in colonies on islands. Very often, seabirds use the sea for food, most often fish or shellfish. The first seabirds evolved in the Cretaceous period, and modern seabird families first appeared in the Palaeogene. The similarities between them are examples of convergent evolution. The same environmental problems and feeding niches have resulted in similar adaptations. 

Seabirds share a number of adaptations to sea life. They live longer, breed later and have fewer young than other birds. They do spend a great deal of time with their young. Most species nest in colonies. These vary from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species take long annual migrations every year, crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Seabirds vary in how much of the year they spend at sea.

Tropical Depression One (2009)

Tropical Depression One was the first tropical cyclone of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season. It was also the third tropical cyclone since 2007 to form before June 1. The storm formed on May 28, and moved across the Atlantic Ocean. Later that day, the storm started to weaken and fall apart. On May 29, the storm died and became a remnant low.

Before the storm became a depression, some parts of the storm brought light rainfall to the eastern tip of North Carolina. However there were no damages or deaths reported. Also the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not give out any tropical storm watches or warnings for the storm.

During mid-May, a disorganized low pressure area formed in the Atlantic Ocean about 290 miles (465 kilometers) south-southwest of Wilmington, North Carolina. The low pressure moved north and started to become more organized. On May 27, the storm was 120 miles (195 km) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina when the National Hurricane Center (NHC) decided to start monitoring the storm. A high pressure area that was located southeast of the storm pushed it into a northeast direction. Then on 8 pm EDT (0000 UTC on May 28), the NHC stopped monitoring the storm, as the low was not expected to strengthen anymore.

On May 28, the NHC started to monitor the storm again and on 11:00 am EDT (1500 UTC), they declared the storm to be a tropical cyclone and named it Tropical Depression One. At that time, the storm's location was about 310 mi (500 km) south of Providence, Rhode Island. After it was named as a depression, the storm showed deep convection and the center of circulation was at the northwestern part of the storm. The reason why the depression restrengthened was because of lower wind shear and warmer ocean waters from the Gulf Stream. Later that day, the depression started to weaken when it moved into an area with higher wind shear and colder ocean waters. Around 7:30 pm EDT (2330 UTC), a QuikSCAT satellite flew over the depression and found tropical storm-force winds. But the NHC thought the depression didn't strengthen and that winds were affected by rain. After the satellite passed over the depression, the center of circulation moved closer to the northwest edge of the storm and convection started to decrease.
On May 29, the depression almost became a tropical storm, when the storm's strength was measured at T2.5, or 40 mph (65 km/h) using the Dvorak technique. But some of the measurements were also low as T1.5, which was the reason why the NHC didn't call it a tropical storm. After a quick burst of convection during the night, thunderstorm clouds inside the depression started to disappear by 3:00 am EDT (0700 UTC). By then, the tropical depression was no longer expected to strength anymore and was forecasted to weaken. A few hours later, the center of circulation was ripped apart by strong wind shear while a nearby trough also started to absorb the rest of the storm. With no convection around the center of the storm, it became a remnant low during the afternoon. At 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC), the NHC gave out its last advisory on Tropical Depression One. The remains of the storm were later taken in by a warm front around 2 am EDT (0600 UTC).

On May 27 the cyclone brought some light rainfall to parts of coastal North Carolina before it was called Tropical Depression One. Hatteras, North Carolina saw 0.1 in (2.5 mm) of rainfall and wind speeds up to 15 mph (24 km/h) with gusts to 23 mph (37 km/h). The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded from the storm was 1009 mbar (hPa; 29.81 inHg).

When the storm became Tropical Depression One on May 28, it was the third time since 1851 that an Atlantic tropical cyclone formed before June 1, the official start of an Atlantic hurricane season. The depression followed Subtropical Storm Andrea of May 2007 and Tropical Storm Arthur of May 2008. The first time this event happened was in 1932, 1933, and 1934; the second time it happened was in 1951, 1952, and 1953. The National Hurricane Center also reported that Tropical Depression One was also the farthest north a May tropical cyclone has ever formed.

Trust (social science)

Trust is a feeling that somebody or something can be relied upon, or will turn out to be good. It is the feeling of being sure about something, even if it cannot be proved. 

The word "trust" can be a noun or a verb:


There is also an adjective: trusting.

One can also trust a thing:


To "trust" often means: to feel confident that something will or has happened:

In religion, trust can be similar to faith. Someone who believes in God will put their trust in Him: the Book of Proverbs says: 'Trust in the LORD with all your heart' (3:5)

To "trust" (or "entrust") can be used in other ways:

Trusting does not necessarily mean that the person or thing that is trusted is good. Two criminals might be friends and they might trust one another, but what they trust one another to do is bad (although it might seem good to them).

Being trusting without thinking carefully about it might be dangerous. People can sometimes win someone’s trust, but then they might break their trust.

The opposite of “trusting” is “mistrust” (“to have no trust in”). This is similar to the word “suspicious”.

Someone who is untrustworthy is someone who cannot be trusted.

To “take something on trust” means: to trust something without looking at it carefully.

Hamengkubowono III. Diponegoro was born at Yogyakarta in 1785 and died at Makassar in 1855. During the Dutch rule, a ruler like his father had lost many rights such as the ability to lease land. Instead, he was paid by the Dutch to keep peace. This was an indignity to his father. This led to an open battle headed by Diponegoro himself using guerrilla tactics, which was called the Java War. It lasted for five years, from 1825 until 1830. During that period Diponegoro had successfully led battles, ambushing Dutch camps and raiding food supplies. Over the period of five years, more than 200,000 people were dead because of the war. In 1830, he was sent away by the Dutch to Manado, then moved to Ujungpandang, and he spent the rest of his life there. After being held by the Dutch in Fort Rotterdam in Ujungpandang for 25 years, he died there in 1855.

Video game content rating system

A video game content rating system is a way to judge and label the content in a video game and what ages it is okay for. It is similar to the movie rating system. 

For example, games with violence or drugs might be marked as teen/adult games that might not be okay for children to play. Games with nudity and adult content might be marked as Adult Only, which means that only adults can buy the game and play it.

There are many different game content rating systems all over the world. 

Star Wars: Jedi Knight

The Jedi Knight series are a video game series produced by LucasArts. The games may be played as first person shooters or as 3rd person games. They follow the story of the mercenary and later Jedi Kyle Katarn. The player controls Katarn in all of the games except "Jedi Academy".

The games are combat focussed with lots of shooting combat where the player fights enemies with blasters and other weapons that shoot projectiles. Starting in Jedi Knight, Kyle begins to learn The Force and gets a lightsaber, the pinnacle of Star Wars weaponry. When Katarn uses the lightsaber, the game can go into third-person mode where the camera follows Katarn from behind so the player can see Katarn fighting with his lightsaber. Once Katarn learns the Force he may use Light Side and Dark Side powers (such as 'Force Heal' or 'Force Push' respectively)

Projectile

A projectile is something that is sent flying through the air, usually as a weapon. Any solid object that is thrown or fired out of something is a projectile. For example, an arrow fired from a bow, a bullet, or even a rock from a slingshot are all projectiles.

Projectile weapons have been used for a long time. Bows and slingshots are very old weapons that were used hundreds of years ago. Now most countries use projectile weapons instead of melee weapons like swords. This is because modern projectile weapons such as guns, rocket launchers, and artillery cannons can shoot at long ranges and are usually more deadly than melee weapons.

Mathematical physics

In applied mathematics, a branch of mathematics, mathematical physics refers to the knowledge made up of equations and ideas which scientists look to for assistance in modeling, describing, or solving problems in physics or related areas. These equations and ideas are derived from areas of pure mathematics. The equations form a consistent structure. An example of a so-called structure is a noncommutative space.

There are many teachers that specialize in mathematical physics, one is Edward Witten, pictured here.

Practitioners includes those who develop and apply mathematical physics.

There are several organized associations in mathematical physics, one is the International Association of Mathematical Physics.

Pokémon Adventures

Pokémon Adventures, released in Japan as , is a Pokémon-related manga based on the video games. Satoshi Tajiri once said that this series is closest to what he imagined the Pokémon world to be: 

The series is written by Hidenori Kusaka and drawn by Mato for the first 9 volumes. Satoshi Yamamoto took over from Mato (who was ill at the time) and has not stopped since. The manga was translated into English in North America by VIZ Media, but publication stopped in 2001 at Volume 7. Recently, Viz has begun re-releasing the series in the form of "The Best of Pokémon Adventures: Red" and "The Best of Pokémon Adventures: Yellow", respectively, this time for $7.95 each, $6 less than nearly a decade ago when the publisher first began to publish the manga. VIZ Media has begun to release the series again with a 2nd edition. The first volume was released on June 2, 2009. and the second volume is to be released in August. In Southeast Asia, Singapore publisher Chuang Yi, currently translates Pokémon Adventures into English, and continues to translate new volumes to this day, so far up to volume 57. Jilin Fine Arts, along with the VIZ Media Shanghai Branch, has translated the manga into Chinese. In Taiwan, it is published by Ching Win, who translates it into Mandarin and releases it in their monthly CoroCoro Comic magazine.

Pragmatics

Pragmatics is the study of meaning in language in a particular context. 

This includes the place where the thing is said, who says it, and the things that you have already said. Also, pragmatics studies how people speak when they both know something. 

Pragmatics studies how people speak not literally, but in an indirect way. It studies why, even though this is the case, people can still understand each other. It studies how people can understand each other even if the words are ambiguous.

The ability to understand what someone intends to tell you is called pragmatic competence. 

Inattentional blindness

Inattentional blindness, or perceptual blindness, is 
when a person does not see something in plain sight. The term is only used for a lack of attention, not for any physical defect of vision. The term was used as a book title.

It is a basic fact of psychology that the "world provides an infinite array of things that might capture attention. Attention is, however, an inherently limited capacity". The mechanism as to what to notice is partly or largely inherited. The usefulness of a particular behaviour is in an “ecology of evolutionary adaptiveness” for ancestral hunter-gatherers. Old world monkeys, who show fear of snakes and have an advanced visual system, evolved in Africa under continual pressure from snakes. Some mammals evolved physiological resistance to snake venoms, but African apes improved their ability to see snakes visually before the snakes could strike.

Millionaires (group)

Millionaires is an American electronic trio from Los Angeles, California. It was started in 2007 by three girls, Melissa Marie Green, Allison Green, and Dani Artaud. They are very popular on MySpace. The girls are notable for their mostly negative reaction from other people. They also performed one show for the TV show Double Shot at Love with the Ikki Twins.

Millionaires started in August 2007, when Melissa Marie and Allison made a song on their new laptop with GarageBand. They named the song "I Like Money", and decided they needed a name for themselves to make a MySpace profile for the song. Melissa Marie and Allison decided on Millionaires, to go with the name of the song. Soon after, Dani came in the mix, and they made their second song, "Hoe Down."

After a few months, they began to perform shows locally and traveled only small distances for shows. They got spots in music festivals such as Rockin Roots,Bamboozle Left 2008,and Audio Overload 2008. By July 2008, they were ready to tour and they went out on their first tour co-headlining with another band, Breathe Carolina across the West coast. Later in July, they headlined the GET F$CKED UP tour.

In July 2008, they performed on MTV's TRL as part of On The Radar, a show where popular bands not signed to a record label perform. The girls returned in January and February 2009 on their Just Got Paid, Let's Get Laid tour, which sold out every date. They made a short song titled "Ooh Uh Huh", which became the theme song for MTV's reality show "A Double Shot At Love" with the Ikki twins. Their song "Hey Rich Boy" was also used as the theme for MTV's Teen Cribs.

Before Millionaires were to release their second EP, "Just Got Paid, Let's Get Laid", it was rumored that the Millionaires were signed to Decaydance after Gabe Saporta from Cobra Starship convinved Pete Wentz to sign them on to the label. Later Wentz sent a message saying that Millionaires were not signed to Decaydance, and that Crush management had asked them to produce hard copies of their EP.




Heckler &amp; Koch MP series

The MP series is a "personal defence weapon" (PDW) made by Heckler & Koch in Germany. It is one of the most popular submachine guns in the world. It is used by many different militaries and counter-terrorism and police groups.

The main version of the MP5, the MP5A2, uses 9mm pistol ammunition and shoots 800 rounds per minute, which is about thirteen rounds per second. The normal magazine size (how many bullets it holds at once) is 30 or 15 rounds.

There are many other versions of the gun, some which use different caliber bullets, are shorter, or have other differences. One important type of MP5 is the MP5SD series, which are MP5s with built in suppressors ('silencers'). The MP5SDs are quieter than most guns and can be used for stealth. The MP5 is used by many special forces groups around the world, including the United States Navy Seals and British SAS.

Since it is used by many heroes in pop culture, it is sometimes called the "good guy gun."


The MP7 is the updated MP5. It was designed with a new cartridge with higher muzzle velocity to meet NATO requirements published in 1989. A modern PDW needs greater ability to defeat body armour, because former weapons used only conventional pistol cartridges. The MP7 went into production in 2001. It is a direct rival to the Belgian FN P90, also developed in response to NATO's requirement. The MP7 has been revised since its introduction and the current production version is the MP7A1.

Several evictees of Meishi Street, located next to Tiananmen Square, fight through endless red tape and the indifference of fellow citizens for the right to keep their homes. Given video cameras by the filmmakers, they shoot exclusive footage of the eviction process, adding vivid intimacy to their story.

Every year Brentwood has a rowing regatta. The regatta is in April for three days. This regatta is the biggest high school rowing regatta in North America, with 1500 students rowing and 3000 people watching.


Cutscene

A cutscene is a time in a video game where the game stops and the player watches something happen. 

Usually cutscenes tell part of the story, such as showing characters talking or having a narrator say what is going on. Sometimes, however, a cutscene just shows something that is happening in the game, like a boss showing up, a ship taking off, or a building falling down.

There are many different types of cutscene. Some cutscenes are very simple and just show pictures with text like a slideshow. Others may be animated like a cartoon. Sometimes the cutscene appears directly in the game engine. 

Many new games use prerendered scenes, meaning that the scene was created when the game was made and saved as a video file. Prerendered videos are sometimes just saved movies of things recorded in the game engine, but some use Computer-generated imagery (CGI), which is separately made 3D graphics which are usually fancier than the game's normal graphics. Prerendered scenes with CGI are often used for a game's intro video.

A few games use live-action video footage, which is filmed like a movie or television show. Sometimes live-action footage will be used together with CGI.

Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution

The Thirteenth Amendment was an amendment to the United States Constitution, meaning that it was a change to the basic and most important laws that govern the United States. It abolished slavery in the United States. It was passed in December 6, 1865, at the end of the Civil War with only a handful of Democrats supporting the Amendment in both Chambers of Congress. It was one of the Reconstruction Amendments. It repealed Article Four, Section 2, of the Constitution; the Fugitive Slave Clause.

Prior to the Civil War, Constitution allowed slavery. However, many groups sought to end slavery in the United States. The groups became the Republican Party in 1856, and gained power in 1860 with the election of Abraham Lincoln.

In 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves only in certain parts of the United States, and did not actually make slavery illegal.

Near the end of the Civil War, Republicans, who controlled Congress, introduced an amendment to make slavery illegal (against the law) in every part of the United States. (In order for an amendment to happen, it first must be passed by both the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, and then passed by three-quarters of the states' legislatures.) The amendment was passed by three-quarters of the states, and became law in late 1865.

Hurricane Jeanne

Hurricane Jeanne was the tenth named storm, the seventh hurricane, and the fifth major hurricane of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. Hurricane Jeanne was a deadly storm, especially to Haiti. The storm cause 3,035 deaths, about 3,006 were in Haiti alone. Hurricane Jeanne was also a costly hurricane. With $7 billion in damage caused, it is the 13th costliest hurricane in U.S. History. In Florida the hurricane made landfall in the same area as Hurricane Frances did only two weeks before.

In spring 2005 the name Jeanne was retired because of the severe damage and the high number of deaths. Jeanne was replaced by Julia in 2010.

Redevelopment

Redevelopment is any new construction on a place which is already in use. An example is the redevelopment of a block of small houses into a large apartment.

Articulated vehicle

An articulated vehicle is a vehicle which has a pivot joint. This allows the vehicle to turn more sharply. 

There are many kinds of articulated vehicles: buses, trams and trains may be articulated. Steam locomotives were sometimes articulated so the driving wheels could pivot around turns. In fact, the whole idea of a train is an articulated set of vehicles which run along a track.

Any vehicle towing a trailer could be described as articulated. The term (UK) of "articulated lorry" refers to the combination of a front part which pulls (the "tractor") and a rear part which follows (the "trailor"). In American English, these may be called semi-trailer trucks..

Balloon loop

A balloon loop allows a train to reverse direction without having to shunt or stop. Balloon loops can be useful for passenger trains, and "unit" freight trains, such as coal trains.

Lund University

Lund University is a public university in Lund. It was founded in 1666 and is the second oldest university in Sweden.

Lope de Rueda

Lope de Rueda (1510?, Seville - 1565, Córdoba) was a Spanish dramatist and author. He was regarded by some as the best of his era. A very versatile writer, he also wrote comedies, farces, and pasos. He was the precursor to what is considered the golden age of Spanish literature.


Guillén de Castro

Guillén de Castro y Bellvis (1569 – July 28, 1631), was a Spanish dramatist of the Spanish Golden Age.

Sic

Sic is a Latin word meaning "thus", "so", "as such", or "in such a manner". In writing, it is put in square brackets and italic type – ["sic"] – to show that any incorrect or unusual spelling, phrases, punctuation, or other quoted material have been copied verbatim (word for word) from its original source.

At first, it was said like the English word "seek" (IPA /'sik/); however, it is normally said like the English word "sick" (/'sɪk/).

The word "sic" may be used to show that an uncommon or old usage is written faithfully: for instance, quoting the U.S. Constitution:

It is often used, though, to highlight an error, sometimes to ridicule, such as here in "The Times":

Sometimes, "sic" is said to be an abbreviation for "said in context", "spelled in context", "said in copy", and other phrases. While incorrect, this still gives the same meaning when used.

Warm front

A warm front is a leading edge of a warmer air mass that is advancing into a cooler air mass.

Warm fronts usually have stratus and cirrus clouds, but sometimes they also have cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds. Before the warm front passes, there can be rain or snow. While it is passing, there is often light rain or drizzle.

Warm fronts move more slowly than cold fronts.

On a weather map warm fronts are shown as red lines with red semicircles pointing in the direction that the front is moving.

Groundwater

Groundwater (or ground water) is water found below the surface. It is water that is in empty spaces of soil and rocks. Groundwater starts as rain (or other precipitation), and flows under ground for long periods of time through aquifers. Groundwater flow returns to the surface again through springs and rivers. Groundwater is an important part of the water cycle. Plants take in groundwater through their roots.

People bring groundwater to the surface by digging or drilling wells below the surface. They bring up water from the aquifer and use it for irrigation and other purposes. Some of the dissolved minerals in groundwater are important in the food making process of plants. Rainwater is the main source of groundwater.

Palm Beach County, Florida

Palm Beach County is the largest county by area in Florida. It is one of three counties that makes up the Miami metropolitan area. In 2020 the number of people in Palm Beach County was 1,492,191. The area of Palm Beach County is 2,386 square miles. Palm Beach County was made in 1909. The three largest cities in Palm Beach County are West Palm Beach (117,000 people), the county seat, Boca Raton (97,000 people), and Boynton Beach (80,000 people). The county owns the southeastern area of Lake Okeechobee.

Palm Beach County was made from part of Miami-Dade County in 1909. It was split into more counties later on. In 1915 the southern part of Palm Beach County became Broward County. In 1917 the northwest part of the county became Okeechobee County. In 1925 the northern part of the county became Martin County.









Lake Okeechobee

Lake Okeechobee is the largest lake in the U.S. state of Florida. Lake Okeechobee covers about 730 square miles (about half the size of Rhode Island). The lake is shared by Glades, Okeechobee, Martin, Palm Beach, and Hendry counties. Some cities on the shore of Lake Okeechobee include: Belle Glade, Clewiston, Okeechobee, and Pahokee. 

All I Ever Wanted (album)

All I Ever Wanted is the fourth studio album by American pop rock singer-songwriter Kelly Clarkson. It was released on March 6, 2009 in Australia and Germany. On March 9, 2009 in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. On March 10, 2009 in Canada, Mexico and the United States. And on March 13, 2009 in Italy. It was her second album to debut at #1 on the Billboard Hot 200. That made it Clarkson's second non-consecutive number-one album. "All I Ever Wanted" went Gold in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.

The album was originally going to be called "Masquerade," but the title was changed to "All I Ever Wanted." That was because because Clarkson felt that there were already albums with similar themes then on the charts, such as P!nk's "Funhouse" and Britney Spears' "Circus". "All I Ever Wanted" sold 828,000 copies in the U.S. The album was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards.


Bernard Herrmann

Bernard Herrmann (born Maximillian Herman; June 29, 1911 – December 24, 1975) was an American composer known for writing music for movies.

He won the Academy Award for the movie "The Devil and Daniel Webster" made in 1941. Herrmann often worked with director Alfred Hitchcock, including "Psycho", "North by Northwest", "The Man Who Knew Too Much", and "Vertigo". He also wrote music for many other movies, including "Citizen Kane", "Cape Fear" and "Taxi Driver". He also wrote music for radio drama including works for Orson Welles. He wrote for several fantasy movies by Ray Harryhausen, and many television programs.

Herrmann stated composers like Charles Ives, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Percy Grainger and Max Steiner as influences.

"Note: This is by the date of release, not when they were written"
These works are for a speaker and a full orchestra. These were written to be played over the radio because a human voice would not be able to be heard over the full volume of an orchestra. The 1935 works were written before June 1935.

Turntablism

Turntablism is the art of changing sounds to create music using phonograph turntables and a DJ mixer.

Originally it just meant to pause a track on a record; than developed as technology grew into being able to create a stopping sound effect that only plays when a person cuts a record on a turntable by placing their hand on the record and turning it counterclockwise.

A technique used to put songs together originally only doable by placing multiple records on a turntable then either playing both at the same time in real time stopping, cutting, adding sound effects, or playing one track halfway threw then stopping it and playing the last half of the other track.

They use cutting and splicing techniques, but with the modern technology they can do so much more then a traditional turntable can do, a modern turntable can splice as many songs as you want, you can rewind, fast forward, pause, slow, speed up and add a melody from one song but use the singer from another.

Nadezhda von Meck

Nadezhda Filaretovna von Meck () ( - ) was a rich Russian businesswoman. She is remembered today for her strange relationship with the famous composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. For many years she paid him a lot of money each month so that he could compose. They wrote passionate love letters to one another, yet they never actually met one another.

She also gave financial support to other people in the arts and music, especially to the composers Nikolai Rubinstein and Claude Debussy.

She was born Nadezhda Filaretovna Frolovskaya. Her family owned a lot of land. Her father loved music. Her mother was a very determined business woman.

Nadezhda learned to play the piano and she read many books, learned foreign languages and learned about paintings.

When she was 16 it was arranged for her to marry Karl von Meck, a 28-year-old engineer. Together they had 18 children, of whom 11 grew up to be adults.

Her husband worked for the government. He did not earn much money and the family was growing quickly. Nadezhda wanted her husband to be rich. At this time the steam engine had recently been invented, and railways were just starting to be built in Russia. Nadezhda thought her husband could earn a lot of money building railways. She was right. As an engineer he became responsible for buildings thousands of miles of railroad tracks. The new railways allowed grain to be transported from Central Russia to places like Moscow.
He soon became a multi-millionaire.

Karl died suddenly in 1873. Nadezhda took over his business matters. She sold one railway and controlled the other one with the help of her brother. She kept away from other people, living a solitary life with her children. She was very strict indeed with them, telling them exactly what to do all the time. She did not like the idea of marriage, but realized her children would need to marry. She tried to get them to marry quickly, probably for financial reasons. 

Nadezhda von Meck was very rich and loved music, so she became an important person in Russian performing arts. Several musicians were employed by her in her house. Claude Debussy lived with the family for a time as a music teacher to her daughters. Debussy was a young man at the time, and not yet famous. 

The only concerts she went to were those given by the Russian Musical Society in Moscow. She sat alone where nobody would notice her. She met Nikolai Rubinstein. She thought he had great talent, but she disagreed with him a lot of the time. 

In 1877 she came into contact with Tchaikovsky, although she never met him. She asked him to compose some pieces for violin and piano to play at her home. Tchaikovsky knew she was a rich lady who paid well, so he quickly composed some music. They wrote letters to one another, exchanged photographs of one another, but they came to an agreement that they would never meet. She paid him 6,000 rubles a year. This was a lot of money: about twenty times the salary of an ordinary government worker. He was able to stop teaching at the Moscow Conservatory and spend his time composing. Between 1877 and 1890 they wrote about 1,200 letters to one another. Her encouragement was very important to him, and helped him to keep happy when he felt depressed.

In 1876 Tchaikovsky had decided to marry. He was then a composer aged 36. He was gay, and this was something terrible in Russia at that time. He was very frightened that people would find out and that he would be bullied. So he decided to marry. He did not care who it was he married, so long as it would make him look respectable. The next year he found a young girl called Antonina to marry. He told Nadezhda. She wrote to congratulate him and told him she hoped he would be happy. A week later, Tchaikovsky wrote to Nadezhda to ask for more money because the marriage had put him into debt. A few weeks later he was writing again to her saying that he hated his wife. He soon separated from her. Writing to Nadezhda was a great support to him at this time. It is impossible to know whether Nadezhda knew he was gay or whether that would have made a difference to her feelings. At any rate, she continued to write that she loved him. 

Her relationship with Tchaikovsky was also a good thing for her. She hated anything to do with sex, so it was good that she could express her emotions to someone whom she did not have to face in person. Tchaikovsky dedicated his Fourth Symphony to her.

On one occasion they met one another by accident. Nadezhda had invited Tchaikovsky to stay at her home. This was a huge house in enormous grounds, so it was easy to arrange that they should not meet. They agreed that they would not go out at the same time. However, one day he came home late and she went out early. She was in a horse carriage and he was walking. When they saw one another they looked away quickly.

In October 1890, von Meck sent Tchaikovsky a year's money in advance, saying that it was the last time she would be able to send him money. She said she was bankrupt. She may have worried that she probably would be bankrupt in a year’s time.

Some people think that she did this because she found out about Tchaikovsky’s homosexuality. Others disagree with this. After all, in her last letter to him she asked him never to forget her.

Nadezhda von Meck died from tuberculosis on 13 January 1894 in Nice, France, two months after Tchaikovsky had died.

Clapper (musical instrument)

A clapper is a basic form of percussion instrument. It is made of two long solid pieces that are clapped together to make sound.

Clappers exist in many forms in many different cultures around the world. They can be made of a wide variety of material. Wood is most common, but metal and ivory have also been used.

Sovereign state

A sovereign state is a country with borders where people live, and where a government makes laws and talks to other sovereign states. The people have to follow the laws that the government makes. Most sovereign states are made up of a singular country and nation. However, some states such as the United Kingdom are made up of multiple countries.

Most sovereign states are "recognized" which means other sovereign states agree that it is really a sovereign state. Being recognized makes it easier for a sovereign state to talk to and make agreements (treaties) with other sovereign states. There are hundreds of recognized sovereign states today - see List of sovereign states

There is no rule to say what exactly makes a state. Usually, the things a state must have are mainly political, not legal. The Czechs and the Poles were seen as separate states during World War I, even though they did not exist as states yet. L.C. Green explained this by saying that "recognition of statehood is a matter of discretion, it is open to any existing state to accept as a state any entity it wishes, regardless of the existence of territory or an established government."

This means that it is up to any state that already exists to treat any other group as a state. This recognition can be direct or implied. When a state does this, it usually means that the group will also be treated as a state for things that happened in the past. Sometimes it means that the state wants diplomatic relations with the other group, but not always.
Sovereignty is a word that is often used wrongly. Lassa Oppenheim said that there is no idea whose meaning is more controversial than sovereignty. From the time the idea of sovereignty was first used in political science until now, there has never been one meaning that everyone agreed on. Justice Evatt of the High Court of Australia says that "sovereignty is neither a question of fact, nor a question of law, but a question that does not arise at all." 

Although the word sovereignty often includes all types of government, ancient and modern, the modern state has some links to the type of government first seen in the 15th century, when the term "state" also first meant what it does today. Because of this, the word is often used to refer only to modern political systems.

We often use the words "country", "nation", and "state" as if they mean the same thing; but there are actually differences:


Because the meaning of the words has changed over time and past writers often used the word "state" in a different ways it is difficult to say exactly what a state is. Mikhail Bakunin used the word simply to mean a governing organization. Other writers used the word "state" to mean any law-making or law enforcement agency. Karl Marx said that the state was what was used by the ruling class of a country to control the rule. According to Max Weber, the state is an organization who are the only people allowed to use violence in a particular area.

In 1815 at the Congress of Vienna the Final Act only recognized 39 sovereign states in Europe. Because of this, they said that in future new states would have to be recognized by other states. In practice, this meant recognition by one or more of the most powerful countries.
This constitutive theory was developed in the 19th century to describe what is and is not a state. With this theory, the need to follow international law depends on whether other sovereign governments recognize the group. Because of this, new states could not become part of the international community or be bound by international law immediately, so recognized nations did not have to respect international law in their dealings with them.

In 1912, an expert said "International Law does not say that a State is not in existence as long as it isn't recognised, but it takes no notice of it before its recognition. Through recognition only and exclusively a State becomes an International Person and a subject of International Law".

One of the major issues is the confusion that happens when some states recognize a new group, but other states do not. Hersch Lauterpacht, one of the main people who supported the theory, suggested that it is a state's job to grant recognition as a possible solution. However, a state may use any set of rules when judging if they should give recognition.

One of the criteria most commonly used by micronations is the Montevideo Convention. The Montevideo Convention was signed on December 26 1933 by the United States, Honduras, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Guatemala, Brazil, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Colombia, Chile, Peru and Cuba but it never received international consensus. The Montevideo Convention has four conditions that a group "should" meet to become a state:


According to this, the existence of a state does not depend upon recognition by other states. Whether or not an group meets the conditions is decided by other states when they decide if they are going to treat that group as a state. Usually, new states are formally recognized by at least a few other states.

Most sovereign states are states "de jure" and "de facto". This means they exist both in law and in real life. However, sometimes states are only "de jure" states. This means that other states see a group as the true government of a place where they have no actual control. Many European states had governments-in-exile during the Second World War which still had relations with the Allies, even though their countries were under Nazi occupation. An example today is the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which is a United Nations observer, has bi-lateral diplomatic relations with 104 states. It has no land of its own, only embassies and consulates. Other states may have sovereignty over a place, but are not recognized by other states, these are "de facto" states only. Many people agree that Somaliland is such a state.

Giza Necropolis

Giza Necropolis (also called the Giza pyramid complex) is a necropolis on the Giza Plateau near the city of Cairo, Egypt. It is about 8 kilometres (5 mi) inland into the desert from the ancient town of Giza on the Nile, and about 25 kilometres (15 mi) southwest of Cairo city centre. The Great Pyramid is the only remaining monument of the Seven Wonders of the World. Construction is thought to have taken 20,000 workers and 20 years.


There have been many theories to explain how the pyramids were built. These theories include:

Halifax, West Yorkshire

Halifax is a large town in West Yorkshire in England. The town has about 88,000 people living in it. 

Halifax is close to Huddersfield and Bradford. It is near the "spine" of England, the Pennines. It is easy to get to Liverpool and Manchester on the west coast, and Leeds and Wakefield to the East. There is a motorway-standard road which goes over the Pennines. Halifax is on the M1 motorway and the M60 motorways.

The economic booms in Leeds and Manchester, particularly in the financial sector, have led to Halifax becoming a commuter town for these two cities.

Halifax has a historic town centre. There is a lot of Victorian architecture in the town centre. Landmarks include the Town Hall, Piece Hall, the Wainwright monument, the Square Chapel and Halifax Minister. Halifax Station is on the main-line to London, King's Cross Station.

What Halifax was known for is making cloth. Its Dean Clough was one of the largest textile factories in the world. It was more than 1⁄2 mile (800 m) long. Today it is converted to hotel, office and retail use.

Power Rangers

Calzone

A calzone (Italian "stocking" or "trouser" or "drooping sack" or "hanging fold") is a turnover from Italy. It is made with ingredients that are like a pizza, but they are not the same. It is folded into a crescent shape before it is cooked. Calzones are made from pizza dough and filled with mozzarella and ricotta cheese. Other things such as ham, salami, vegetables or an egg can used as fillings as well. The dough is folded over, sealed along the edge and then fried. It is usually served with a seafood sauce, or with garlic, parsley and olive oil.

The Pizza Hut restaurant sells large calzones known as the P'zone. In America, the Hot Pockets brand of microwaveable turnovers are called "Bread Stuffed Calzones".

In Chicago, the calzone is usually called a "pizza puff", made by Italco Foods.


Bisexual pornography

Bisexual pornography is a genre of pornography which generally shows one woman and two men, all perform sex acts with each other. Bisexual pornography is separate from threesome pornography, which shows one man and two women.

As most pornography is marketed to men, most bisexual porn is advertised to straight or bisexual men. Very few customers of bi-porn say they are gay. Producers who use the term "bisexual porn" are usually showing what a bisexual or bi-curious man might wish to see. Sex acts between a man and a woman, as well as between two men. A common way that these are shown in a single scene is with one woman and two men performing together.

Images and videos showing male bisexuality have been more popular since the start of internet pornography. However the area is still a very small grouping of the pornographic DVD market. For example, at porn seller HotMovies.com, there are only 655 bisexual movies out of a showing of more than 90,000 movies. Bisexual DVDs sell much better online than in adult video stores. This may be because customers in stores feel embarrassed to buy them. Most bisexual porn is made by small companies rather than the major studios. Actors are mostly new at porn. Any well-known actors in bisexual porn usually are from the gay pornography industry, although they may not be gay or even bisexual in their personal life.

Heterosexual actors and actresses who have appeared in bisexual porn, for example Kurt Lockwood, have had their sexual orientation doubted, and have been accused by the gay community of being in denial about their homosexuality.

Bisexual pornography may include any of the following:


Soap made from human corpses

During World War II, many people thought that the Nazis were making soap from the bodies of Jewish people who died in the concentration camps.

The Yad Vashem Memorial has said that the Nazis did not make a lot of soap from Jewish bodies. Yad Vashem says that the Nazis used rumors about making soap from bodies to scare the camp inmates. However, there is evidence that research facilities had come up with a way for large amounts of soap to be made from human bodies.

During World War I, the British had already accused Germany of using the fat from human bodies to make things. In April 1917 "The Times" wrote that the Germans were using the bodies of their own dead soldiers to make soap and other products. It was not until 1925 that the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Austen Chamberlain, officially said that the "corpse factory" story had been an error.

Stories that the Nazis made soap from the bodies of concentration camp victims were common during the war. Germany did not have enough fats to make soap during World War II. Because of this, the government took control of making soap.

The "human soap" stories may have started because the bars of soap made by the government were marked with the initials "RIF." Some people thought this stood for "Reichs-Juden-Fett" in German. This means "State Jewish Fat" in English. (In German acronyms, "I" and "J" were often used like the same letter, so people thought "RIF" could mean "RJF".) In fact, "RIF" stood for "Reichsstelle für Industrielle Fettversorgung." This was the German government agency in charge of making and giving out soap and washing products during the war. (In English, the agency's name was the "National Center for Industrial Fat Provisioning.") RIF soap was not very good, and did not have any kind of fat.

Raul Hilberg reports that stories about soap made from human fat were told in Lublin, Poland, as early as October 1942. The Germans knew about the stories. Heinrich Himmler, the leader of the SS, got a letter saying the Poles thought Jewish people were being "boiled into soap." The letter also said the Poles feared they would also be used to make soap. These stories were so widely known that some Polish people actually refused to buy soap. Himmler was so worried by the rumors, and the thought of poor security at the camps, that he said that all bodies should be burnt or buried as quickly as possible.

Soviet propagandist Ilya Ehrenburg reported a common version of the story as fact in "The Complete Black Book of Russian Jewry":

During the Nuremberg Trials, Sigmund Mazur, a laboratory worker at the Danzig Anatomical Institute, said that soap had been made from the bodies of dead people at Stutthof concentration camp. He said that 70 to 80 kg of fat collected from 40 bodies could make more than 25 kg of soap. He also said that the finished soap was kept by Professor Rudolf Spanner. Mazur gave a recipe that read: ""5 kilos of human fat are mixed with 10 liters of water and 500 or 1,000 grams of caustic soda. All this is boiled 2 or 3 hours and then cooled. The soap floats to the surface while the water and other sediment remain at the bottom. A bit of salt and soda is added to this mixture. Then fresh water is added and the mixture again boiled 2 or 3 hours. After having cooled, the soap is poured into molds."" 

At the Nuremberg Trials, Nazi witnesses and British prisoners of war supported Mazur's story. (The British prisoners of war had been used as forced labor to build the Stutthof camp.) These witnesses talked about seeing:
After doing research, Holocaust survivor Thomas Blatt found little evidence of mass production of soap from human fat. However, he found evidence that soap had been made from human fat in experiments. Holocaust historian Robert Melvin Spector agrees that the Nazis "did indeed use human fat for the making of soap at Stutthof," but in small amounts. In his book "Russia at War 1941 to 1945", Alexander Werth said that while visiting Danzig in 1945 just after it was freed by the Red Army, he saw an experimental factory outside the city for making soap from human bodies. Werth said that it had been run by "a German professor called Spanner" and "was a nightmarish sight, with its vats full of human heads and torsoes pickled in some liquid, and its pails full of a flakey substance - human soap".

After the war, in 1955, Alain Resnais included the idea that the Nazis made large amounts of "human soap" in his Holocaust documentary movie "Nuit et brouillard". After the war, some Israelis also spoke about Jewish victims of Nazism with the Hebrew word "סבון" ("sabon", "soap").

Mainstream Holocaust scholars think the idea that Nazis made large amounts of "human soap" is part of WWII folklore. Examples of scholars who believe this include the well-known Jewish historians Walter Laqueur, Gitta Sereny, and Deborah Lipstadt. Other people who believe this include Professor Yehuda Bauer of Israel's Hebrew University, and Shmuel Krakowski, archives director of Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust center. Historian Yisrael Gutman agrees that "it was never done on a mass scale." And Holocaust historian Robert Melvin Spector says that the Nazis "did indeed use human fat for the making of soap at Stutthof," but in small amounts.

Today Holocaust deniers use this story to make people doubt the Nazi genocide.

"The Soap Myth" is a 2009 play about Nazis making soap from the bodies of the people they murdered.

Monroe Doctrine

The Monroe Doctrine was a foreign policy of the United States that was proclaimed in 1823 during the presidency of US President James Monroe but had been the idea of Secretary of State John Quincy Adams. It stated that no European power could colonize any more of the Americas or of the Western Hemisphere in general.

In particular, most of the Spanish Empire in South America had recently become independent because of the Napoleonic Wars against France. Having won the Peninsular War, Spain wanted its empire back, which the Monroe Doctrine stated that the United States would resist. The United Kingdom agreed because it wanted to trade with the newly-independent countries and so it helped enforce the Monroe Doctrine by its powerful Royal Navy.

WarGames

WarGames is a 1983 American science fiction thriller teen movie starring Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy and directed by John Badham. The movie follows a computer hacker named David Lightman (Broderick) who breaks into a NORAD war games simulation computer that he thinks is really the computer for a computer game company. Lightman begins a series of events that could start World War III. The movie was nominated for three Academy Awards and was a big hit. It continues to be popular.

The movie begins with two air force officers in a nuclear missile silo who are ordered to fire the missiles in the silo. The officers believe the order to be real and begin to fire the missiles. One of the officers decides not to fire and so the US government replaces all the men in the missile silos with computer control.
David Lightman (Broderick) is a smart high school student and computer hacker that at first limits himself to changing his and a girl whom he likes a lot, Jennifer's (Sheedy) grades from failing to passing grades: Lightman being smart but not motivated at school. A little while later David uses his IMSAI 8080 computer to dial many phone numbers and finds a backdoor into a NORAD war games simulation computer called WOPR (nicknamed the "Whopper"). At first David is looking for new computer games to download and play and believes that the WOPR is actually the computer of a company that makes new computer games. After finding a list of games on the computer decides to play a game. WOPR (who is an Artificial Intelligence computer) asks David for a password and after doing some research on the computer's creator Professor Steven Falken he guesses that the password is named after the creator's dead son, Joshua. After logging in using the correct password, W.O.P.R. believes David to actually be Dr. Falken whom the computer had believed to be dead. The computer (which David now calls "Joshua") asks him if he would like to play a game. David selects the game "Global Thermonuclear War". Doing so starts off a series of events that will end up taking the World into World War III unless it is stopped.

The television news later reports that the USA went on high-alert due to a computer error leading David and Jennifer to wonder if they had caused the problem. David throws away the evidence of his calling Joshua but the computer calls David back. David then asks Joshua if the game it is playing is real or not, Joshua relies "what is the difference?" At this point David learns that Joshua is not a computer game companies' computer but a government one and is actually is playing the game for real. He hangs up but Joshua calls him back, leading David to remove the cord from the back of his telephone. David is then arrested by the FBI and taken to NORAD to answer charges of espionage. David tries to explain that he was not trying to be a spy, but he is not believed. Using things found in the medical office in which he is locked, David escapes from NORAD on a bus load of visitors to the facility. After David escapes he telephones Jennifer (using Phreaking skills) to ask her to buy him an airplane ticket so he can go and see Falken and get his help in stopping Joshua. Jennifer meets him and together then both go off to convince Falken to help them stop World War III.

Professor Falken has in fact resigned from NORAD because he believes war will happen no matter what any one does. Jennifer and David try to convince him to help them explain to NORAD that this is just a game that Joshua is playing. Falken tells them that it is not worth it as it may only buy them a few years but war will still happen. He explains that they are lucky because he lives only a few miles from a primary target and that they will die in a instant. David and Jennifer decide to try to stop the game anyway and try to leave the island. Finding no way off the island since the last ferry has left, Jennifer says that they should "swim for it". David admits he cannot swim. Professor Falken shows up with a helicopter and together they all go to NORAD.

Inside NORAD Falken tells them it is all a game and they decide to allow the missiles that the Soviet Union has reportedly fired to land to see if it is real or a game. The computer screens show the missiles landing but no missiles actually land. This convinces NORAD that the whole thing was not real. Joshua, however, decides to crack the launch codes and fire the USA's missiles for real. David and Falken try to get Joshua to stop the firing and eventually succeed when Jennifer mentions the word "games". After many tries they get Joshua to play tic-tac-toe against itself in an effort to teach it the meaning of (a word meaning that there is no point to doing something, or that doing so will not help). Joshua tries every game of tic-tac-toe possible and then tries the same thing with every scenario within the Global Thermonuclear War game. Joshua then learns that war can not be won, and stops the game ending the threat of World War III.

The movie was a hit. It was nominated for three Academy Awards. The movie had a production budget of $12 million and had gross revenues of over $120 million making it a high earning movie.

"WarGames" has a cult following amongst computer users and fans of the 1980s. The movie led to the development of the term war dialing (the calling of phone numbers looking for computers to connect to and hack).



Disquisitiones Arithmeticae

Disquisitiones Arithmeticae is a book about number theory written by the German mathematician and scientist Carl Friedrich Gauss.

IMSAI 8080

The IMSAI 8080 was an early microcomputer begun in late 1975, based on the Intel 8080 and later 8085 and the S-100 bus. It was compatible with its main competitor, the earlier MITS Altair 8800, by which it was inspired. The IMSAI is largely thought of as the first "clone" computer. The IMSAI machine used a highly modified version of the CP/M operating system called IMDOS. It was designed, made and sold by IMS Associates, Inc. (later renamed "IMSAI Manufacturing Corp"). In total, between 17,000 and 20,000 units were produced from 1975 until 1978.

In May 1972, William Millard began business as "IMS Associates" (IMS) in the area of computer consultancy and engineering, using his home as an office. By 1973, Millard began IMS Associates, Inc. Millard soon found capital for his business, and received several contracts, all for software.
