Her poem "The Lurkers Support Me in E-Mail" is widely quoted on it and in other online arguments, often without her name attached.

Her first three novels, "The King's Peace" (2000), "The King's Name" (2001), and "The Prize in the Game" (2002) were all fantasy. They happen in a world based on Arthurian Britain and the Táin Bó Cúailnge's Ireland. Her next novel, "Tooth and Claw" (2003) was about dragons, but in the style of Anthony Trollope.

Cytoplasmic streaming

Cytoplasmic streaming is where there is flow inside the cytoplasm. It is sometimes called protoplasmic streaming or cyclosis.

Streaming is often seen in large plant and animal cells. Cytoplasm moves inside the cells. The flow is driven by forces in the cytoskeleton. The function of the flow is probably to speed up transport of molecules and organelles around the cell. Cytoplasmic streaming is usually found in large cells, larger than about 0.1 mm. In smaller cells diffusion of molecules is rapid, but it slows as the cell size increases. Larger cells need flow to move nutrients inside them rapidly enough for efficient working.

Launch vehicle

A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket used to take a payload from Earth's surface through outer space. This can be to another place on earth (Sub-orbital transportation), or into space. Sub-orbital vehicles aren't as powerful as orbital vehicles must be. They use more than one stage so that they have enough delta-v performance. Many different rocket fuels can be used, and some rockets have solid rocket boosters attached. 

Most launch vehicles are expendable, which means that they can only be used once. This means that lots of expensive equipment is lost, but it also means that the launch vehicle can carry a heavier payload. SpaceX has developed a partly reusable rocket, called the Falcon 9. It is also developing a fully reusable rocket called Starship. The first stage of this rocket can land and be relaunched. Parts of the Space Shuttle were also reusable. There are many different types of launch vehicle. The vehicle that is used depends on the spaceport, the mass of the payload, and the orbit that the payload is being launched to. Many countries try and build their own rockets as part of their national space programs.

Prince Archie of Sussex

Prince Archie of Sussex (Archie Harrison; born 6 May 2019) is the son of Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. He is the eighth great-grandchild of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He is the 4th grandchild of King Charles III and is sixth in line of succession to the British throne.

Titles

8 May 2019-9 March 2023 Master Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor 

9 March 2023 His Royal Highness Prince Archie Harrison of Sussex 

He was born at 05:26 BST (04:26 UTC) on 6 May 2019. at Portland Hospital in London. His name was announced on 8 May 2019. He was baptised wearing the royal christening gown by the Archbishop of Canterbury on 6 July 2019 in the private chapel at Windsor Castle. The ceremony was private and the public were not invited to see the family or guests arrive or leave.

Archie descends from the British royal family on his father's side and from the American working and middle classes on his mother's side. He is a citizen both of the United Kingdom and of the United States.

He is the first half-American and the third multiracial child in the history of the British monarchy.

As a grandson of King Charles III, Archie is sixth in the line of succession to the British throne. At the time of his birth, he normally would be entitled to use his Prince Harry's senior subsidiary title, Earl of Dumbarton, as a courtesy. However, it was reported that the Duke and Duchess decided that he would be styled as Master Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, as they wanted him to grow up as a private citizen.

In the 2021 television interview, the Duchess of Sussex said that she had been told that changes would be made to remove Archie's entitlement to the style of "prince" as part of Charles's reported plans for a slimmed-down monarchy. 


Forensic anthropology

Forensic anthropology is the analysis of human remains for the purpose of solving criminal cases and identifying the cause of death. In order to understand the death of a person, forensic anthropologists collect information from their bones. Forensic anthropologists use bone analysis to learn more about the person who died.

"How old was the person when they died?"

Scientists can discover the stages of growth and development that the bones were in when a person died to guess their age. Bones such as the femur can be measured in order to determine what stage of life a person was in. A child’s bones would typically be shorter than an adult’s bones, and a child's bones would not have the epiphyses, the growing part of a bone, attached completely. Another way to determine age is to look for cartilage, a tissue that is replaced by hard bone as a person gets older. Younger children will have more cartilage in their bones while adults will have more hard bone. Using these methods can help guess the age of a person when they died. 

"How did they die?"

Causes of death are usually related to injury and/or disease. Forensic anthropologists study bone to see if injuries were caused by bullets, blunt objects, sharp objects, or other weapons. Injuries that cause death can also be accidental, like falling or a car accident. They may also be able to see if a person had a disease that caused their death. Some diseases can cause changes in the structure of bone. Anemia can cause bones in the skull to flatten. Diseases like scurvy and rickets can cause bones to soften and bend. Diseases like rickets can also be used to identify the person if their doctor or the police knew they had the disease. 

"What is the sex of the person who died?"

"When did they die?" 

"What is the individual’s ancestry?"

"Occupational Markers"

When looking at bones, anthropologists look for markings left on bones caused by stress. These markings are called stress markers or occupation markers. Occupational markers can be found in cases where muscles or tendons insert into the cortical tissue of bone via the , or where there is hypertrophy of muscular attachments on the bones. The cause of the markers left are from repetitive activities over a long period of time. But some studies do not think occupational markers are very helpful for forensic identification and may be a source of bias.

Web shell

A Web shell is a script that can be uploaded to a web server to enable remote administration of the machine. A web shell can be written in any language that the target web server supports. The most commonly observed web shells are written in languages that are widely supported, such as PHP and ASP. Perl, Ruby, Python, and Unix shell scripts are also used. Once successfully uploaded, an adversary can use the web shell to leverage other exploitation techniques to escalate privileges and to issue commands remotely. These commands are directly linked to the privilege and functionality available to the web server and may include the ability to add, delete, and execute files as well as the ability to run shell commands, further executables, or scripts.
Web shells such as China Chopper, WSO, C99 and B374K are frequently chosen by adversaries; however these are just a small number of known used web shells.

The first round pick of the NFL draft, Kyler Murray was selected by the Arizona Cardinals. He played in Oklahoma. He won the Heisman Trophy in 2018, which is an award for the most outstanding college football player in the United States.

Baker Mayfield

Baker Mayfield (born April 14, 1995) is an American football player for the NFL. He selected 1st overall by the Cleveland Browns in 2018 and started for the Browns for two seasons. After two seasons at Carolina, he is now the starting quarterback at Tampa Bay. Before that, he played college football at Texas Tech University before he moved on to Oklahoma University, where won the Heisman Trophy, which is an award for the most outstanding college football player in the nation. 

In his first year, Mayfield broke a record for most touchdown passes by a rookie and also helped the Browns rebound from a very bad season the previous year. In 2020, he helped Cleveland make the playoffs for the first time since 2002, and they also won a playoff game. However, after Mayfield struggled with injuries in 2021 and did not get along with new coach Kevin Stefanski, the Browns traded for embattled quarterback Deshaun Watson, all but marking the end of Mayfield's time in Cleveland. Mayfield himself was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before the 2023-2024 season.

Mayfield was born on April 14, 1995 in Austin, Texas to James and Gina Mayfield and has two brothers. He played high school football for Lake Travis High School and grew up a fan of Oklahoma. Mayfield's father James played football for the University of Houston and eventually became a businessman focusing on private equity. The Mayfield family was well off until they ran into hard times during Baker's last year of high school, when they had to sell their house.

Mayfield first decided to enroll at Texas Tech University after finishing high school. He signed up for their football team as a walk-on, and eventually became their starting quarterback that year. He did well for the first few games before he got hurt and was benched for Davis Webb.

Mayfield transferred to Oklahoma after his first year, as he believed his treatment at Texas Tech was not fair. Because of rules for transfer students, Mayfield would have to sit out for one year in 2014 before being able to play for Oklahoma in 2015. This sparked a debate and eventually led to the creation of the "Baker Mayfield rule", which allows walk-on players to play immediately after transferring to another school in the same conference.

After winning the competition for starting quarterback from previous starter Trevor Knight in 2015, Mayfield passed for over 3,700 yards and averaged almost 40 passing touchdowns in all three years he was Oklahoma's quarterback. He finished near the top in Heisman Trophy voting before winning it in his senior year. Oklahoma would also win the Big 12 Conference championship in all three years, also making it to the Sugar Bowl in 2016 and the Rose Bowl in 2017.

T-ara

T-ara () is a South Korean girl group. They are one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. T-ara was formed in 2009. The group mainly makes dance-pop music. This is partly due to their partnership with composer Shinsadong Tiger, who has favored that genre. T-ara uses a wide variety of visual looks in their dance and performances.

T-ara debuted in July 2009 with the single "Lies". Their first studio album was called the "Absolute First Album". It was released in December 2009 and lead to several hit songs. These included "TTL (Time to Love)", "Bo Peep Bo Peep", and "You Drive Me Crazy".

In 2011, T-ara released the song "Roly-Poly". It became the best-selling single of the year on the "Gaon" chart in South Korea. The group also became popular in Japan. Later that year they signed a contract with agency J-Rock to manage their sales in Japan. The contract was for USD 4.7 million. This was the most any Korean girl group had made in a foreign market at the time. T-ara went on to make a Japanese studio album called "Jewelry Box". This album reached number one on the "Oricon" weekly charts in Japan. Also in 2011, T-ara released the Korean album "Black Eyes". It lead to three number ones songs in a row. These were "Cry Cry", "We Were in Love" and "Lovey-Dovey".

In 2012, T-ara had a drop in popularity. The group was accused of disagreements and problems with one another. Soon after, Hwayoung left T-ara. Areum did the same a year after. After these issues, T-ara's albums and songs had mixed success in South Korea. As a result, T-ara changed their focus to China. In 2014, they made a cover of the Chopstick Brothers' song "Little Apple". After focusing on China, T-ara became one of the most popular K-pop groups in the country.

In 2017, the contracts of Soyeon and Boram were set to expire. On the other hand, Qri, Eunjung, Hyomin and Jiyeon had extended their contracts. This would reduce the members of the group from six to four. T-ara had intended to make one more album as a six-member group. However, a conflict with their management lead to a delay and it did not happen. T-ara's next release was as a four-member group. This was the EP called "What's My Name?" which was released in June 2017.

T-ara was formed by the record label Mnet Media, which is now known as Stone Music Entertainment. The original members of T-ara were Jiae, Jiwon, Eunjung, Hyomin and Jiyeon. They trained together for three years before their debut. The group's name is based on the word "tiara". The idea for the name was that they would be "queens of the music industry". Their first song came before their official debut as a group. It was "Joheun Saram" for the soundtrack of the "Cinderella Man" television show. One month before their official debut, Mnet Media changed some of the members of the group. Jiae and Jiwon left T-ara in early June 2009, and were replaced by Boram, Soyeon, and Qri. Then in early July 2009, T-ara was moved from Mnet Media to Core Contents Media. Core Contents Media is a subsidiary of Mnet Media, and is now known as MBK Entertainment.

T-ara made their debut in July 2009 on the "Radio Star" talk show. Their first performance was on the "M Countdown" music show a few days later. It included the songs "Geojitmal" (or "Lies") and "Norabollae?". The performance had negative reviews by those who watched it. Some felt was that it was lip-synced and had an "elementary school" appearance. In response, the group decided that future performances would be live. In September 2009, T-ara made the song TTL "(Time to Love)" with the boy band Supernova. It became the first number one song for both groups and topped many online charts. A month later, T-ara and Supernova made the follow up song "TTL Listen 2".

T-ara made their first studio album in November 2009, with the name "Absolute First Album". Core Contents Media held a survey to have the public help choose which song would be the title track. The choices were "Bo Peep Bo Peep" and "Cheoeum Cheoreom" (처음처럼, "Like the First Time"). Of the 9,000 people who took the survey, 53% chose "Cheoeum Cheoreom". However, "Bo Peep Bo Peep" was chosen as the title track. It made it to number four on the "Gaon" chart. "Cheoeum Cheoreom" made it to number ten. T-ara performed these songs live on the "Music Bank" television show on 4 December 2009. At the 24th Golden Disk Awards, T-ara won Rookie of the Year along with girl group 4minute.

The group won their first music show award with "Bo Peep Bo Peep" on the first day of 2010. The song went on to win five awards in total. T-ara intended to follow up with promotions for "Cheoeum Cheoreom" as well. But these had to be canceled in January 2010, as Soyeon got sick with H1N1. Later that month, T-ara had a cameo appearance in two episodes of the television show "God of Study".

In February 2010, the group re-released their debut album under the title "Breaking Heart". The digital release was on February 23. The two lead singles were "Neo Ttaemune Michyeo" (너 때문에 미쳐; "I Go Crazy Because of You") and "Naega Neomu Apa" (내가 너무 아파, "I'm Really Hurt"). "Neo Ttaemune Michyeo" made it to number one on the "Gaon" chart and "Naega Neomu Apa" made it to thirty-one. T-ara performed on the same day on "M Countdown". They went on to win three awards for "Neo Ttaemune Michyeo". The physical release of the album was March 3. It made it to number two on the weekly "Gaon" chart and number thirty-five on the yearly chart. T-ara performed "Naega Neomu Apa" on music shows in March and early April 2010.

In July 2010, T-ara added Hwayoung as a seventh member. The stated reason was to give other members some relief from their heavy schedules. It would also allow each member to be away for solo activities from time to time. In November 2010, the group starred in the third season of the reality show "Hello Baby". Later that month, T-ara released "Wae Ireoni". It is the lead single for their first extended play, which is called "Temptastic". "Temptastic" was released in December 2010, along with the single, "Yayaya". T-ara performed on "Music Bank" on December 3 with their new seventh member Hwayoung. They later won awards for "Wae Ireoni" and "Yayaya" on "M Countdown".

T-ara made their second extended play (or EP) in June 2011. The title is "John Travolta Wannabe". It made it to number three on the Gaon Album Chart. The EP's single, "Roly-Poly", made it to number two on the Gaon Digital Chart and number one on the Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart. It became the highest-selling song of 2011 in South Korea. "Roly-Poly" won the award of Best Music Video at the 3rd Melon Music Awards. T-ara also won Singer of the Year at the 1st Gaon Chart Awards. They were also nominated for Best Dance Performance by a Female Group and Song of the Year at the 13th Mnet Asian Music Awards.

In August 2011, T-ara made a limited edition re-issue of "John Travolta Wannabe" with the title "Roly-Poly in Copacabana". The title track is a eurodance remix of "Roly-Poly". It was given the name "Roly-Poly in Copacabana" after the song "Copacabana" which was popular in the 1980's in disco clubs. The album made it to number three on the Gaon chart. The song made it to number forty-five on the Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart. The group then performed the song on the "Music Bank" television show.

T-ara made a Japanese version of "Bo Peep Bo Peep" in September 2011. It made it to number one on the "Oricon" weekly chart. This made T-ara the first non-Japanese girl group to make it to number one on the "Oricon" chart. The song also made it to number one on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart.

In November 2011, T-ara made their third EP, "Black Eyes", which made it to number two on the "Gaon" charts. The album followed the release of the song "Cry Cry", which made it to number one on the Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100. "Cry Cry" also won two first-place awards on "M Countdown". The music video for "Cry Cry" had a billion Korean won budget and a thirty-minute drama story line. The group made their second Japanese song, a remake of "Yayaya" from their "Temptastic" EP, in November. It made it to number seven on the "Oricon" charts and number six on the Billboard Japan Hot 100.

In December 2011, the group held a three-day concert tour in Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka. By the end of the year, T-ara had become the second most popular girl group in Korea. Also in December, T-ara made a ballad with Davichi called "Uri Saranghaetjanha" (우리 사랑했잖아, "We Were in Love"). It was later included on T-ara's "Funky Town" re-release album. "Uri Saranghaetjanha" made it to number one on the "Gaon" chart and number two on the Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100. Both groups performed the song on SBS's "Inkigayo" television show.

T-ara re-released "Black Eyes" under the title "Funky Town" in January 2012. The album made it to number one on the "Gaon" weekly chart and number two on the monthly chart. "Lovey-Dovey" was the second single from the album. It made it to number one on both the "Gaon" and "Billboard Korea" charts.

In February 2012, Forbes Korea listed T-ara as number 17 in their list of "Top 40 Power Celebrities". In April, Core Contents Media announced that they would add two new members to T-ara. Areum joined T-ara in June 2012, bringing the group to eight members. The second new member was to be Dani, who was 14 years old at the time. While she starred in T-ara's "Day by Day" music video, she did not end up becoming a member.

T-ara made their first Japanese studio album in June 2012 with the title "Jewelry Box". It made it to number two on the "Oricon" weekly albums chart with sales of over 57,000 copies. Following the album release, T-ara held a concert tour in Japan.

In July 2012, T-ara released their fourth extended play (EP), with the title "Day by Day". It made it to number five on the "Gaon" chart. The title track, also called "Day by Day", was released as a single on the same day. It made it to number two on the "Gaon" chart. On July 7, T-ara performed "Day by Day" live on "Music Core" with a 70-person orchestra. This was the first time Areum performed with the group.

In late July 2012, T-ara held a concert in Japan. Hwayoung only performed one song due to a leg injury. Afterwards, one member of T-ara tweeted a message about showing determination. Later four of the other members agreed with her. After this Hwayoung and her twin sister (Hyoyoung) tweeted about a "bad person". This lead to rumors of conflict within the group. Some assumed that Hwayoung was being bullied. Soon after, Core Contents Media ended Hwayoung's contract and she left T-ara. The stated reason was that Hwayoung's actions were harming teamwork. The record label claimed that the bullying rumors were not a factor in the decision. The group stated that the rumors were not true but did confirm a conflict between Hwayoung and the others. Due to the rumors, the group put all activity on hold for a time. Their scheduled performances were postponed without a new date planned.

In September, T-ara resumed their activity as a group. In that month they released "Mirage", which was a re-issue of their "Day by Day" EP with additional songs. Two of the songs from the EP were also released as singles on the same day. These were "Sexy Love" and "Najgwa Bam (Love All)" (낮과 밤, "Day and Night"). "Sexy Love" made it to number four on the "Gaon" charts and number three on the Billboard Korea K-pop Hot 100 charts. While the new EP and song were a success, the group’s popularity suffered a drop due to the bullying rumors.

Later in September, T-ara made a Japanese version of "Day by Day". In October, T-ara released a greatest hits album in Japan. They stated that it was in celebration of one year since their Japanese debut. Also in October, T-ara made a Japanese version of "Sexy Love" and traveled to Japan to promote it.

In March 2013, T-ara released their sixth Japanese single, with the title "Bunny Style!" It was their first song made just for the Japanese market. It was released in ten different editions. Each of these included a different second song along with "Bunny Style!" Seven of them had a solo song by one of the T-ara members. Three of them had a song performed by a sub-group (a smaller group formed from members within T-ara). To promote the single, T-ara held special concerts in 10 Japanese cities.

In April, T-ara formed a sub-group with members Eunjung, Hyomin, Jiyeon, and Areum. It was given the name T-ara N4. The sub-group made the song "Jeon Won Diary".

List of territorial entities where English is an official language

The following is a list of territories where English is an official language. As of 2019, there were 55 sovereign states and 27 non-sovereign states where English was an official language.

Most countries where English is a prominent or official language are former colonies of the British Empire. Notable exceptions include Rwanda, which was a former Belgian colony, and Eritrea, which was an Italian colony where the British Empire controlled it only in World War II and shortly after (19411952).

English is the sole official language of the Commonwealth of Nations and the Commonwealth Games. 
English is one of the official languages of the United Nations, the European Union and the International Olympic Committee.

Although English is not classified as an official language in the United States. Instead, many states and regions within the U.S. do have English as an official language.
India's linguistic picture is complex. According to the Constitution of India, "Hindi in the Devanagari script" is the official language of the union; and English the 'subsidiary official language'; however, English must be used for the official texts of all federal laws and Supreme Court decisions (with Hindi). It is one of the two languages of the Indian Parliament. English is taught in schools. The quality and effectiveness of the teaching is very varied. English is used almost exclusively for higher education.
The situation of Pakistan is also complex. While the national language is Urdu, English is an official language and used in business, government and law.

In these country subdivisions, English has "de jure" official status, but English is not official in their relevant countries at the national level.

Cocos plate

The Cocos plate is a geologically young oceanic tectonic plate. It is beneath the Pacific Ocean off the west coast of Central America. Cocos Island rides on it. 

The Cocos plate was created about 23 million years ago when a larger plate broke into two pieces. The other piece became the Nazca plate. The Cocos plate also broke into two pieces, creating the small Rivera plate. 

The Cocos plate touches several different plates. To the northeast it touches the North American plate and the Caribbean plate. To the west it touches the Pacific plate and to the south the Nazca plate.

This complicated set of little plates is caused by what geologists call the "Cocos-Nazca spreading system". The leading edge is subducting (going under existing plates). This causes the Central American Volcanic Arc.

The Cocos Plate is near the Galapagos hotspot, which caused the Galapagos Islands.

British Columbia New Democratic Party

The New Democratic Party of British Columbia (BC NDP) is a provincial political party in British Columbia, Canada. It is a social democratic party and is considered to be centre-left. David Eby has been the leader of the party since 2022. The party is a part of the federal New Democratic Party.

The party is the one governing the province right now. This is because there was a hung parliament after the 2017 elections and the BC Liberal Party did not win a motion of no confidence in the legislature. Instead, the BC NDP began a confidence and supply deal with the BC Green Party to form a minority government. Before that, the party governed British Columbia under six different premiers. They also won a majority government three times, in 1971, 1991, and 1996.

The leader before 2014 was Adrian Dix. He resigned from being the leader of the BC NDP in 2013. Because of this, there was an election in the party in 2014 to decide who would be the next leader. John Horgan was elected by acclamation (when there are no other candidates). Because he became leader, he also became the Leader of the Opposition in the legislature.

The first election that the NDP took part in while Horgan was the leader was the 2017 general election. The NDP won 41 seats in the election. The other parties that won seats were the Liberal Party (43 seats) and the Green Party (3 seats). The Liberal Party did not win enough seats to form a majority government so the first minority government in BC in 65 years was elected. This was a very close election. The Liberals won the popular vote by only 1566 votes. Because both parties did not have enough seats to form a majority government, the Greens held the balance of power. Both the Liberals and NDP began negotiating with the Greens to see if they would support a minority government by either of the parties. On 29 May, Horgan and the Greens announced that the Greens would support the NDPs in a confidence and supply deal. The Liberals lost a vote of no confidence vote by two votes to the Greens and NDP. Because of this, the Lieutenant Governor Judith Guichon asked Horgan to form government and become the next premier. Horgan became the first NDP premier in 16 years.

On November 4, 2021, Horgan announced that he had a malignant tumor in his throat and that he would need radiation treatment. On June 28, 2022, Horgan said he would step down as both premier and leader of the BC NDP party when a new leader was been selected.

On October 21, 2022, David Eby would be elected as the Horgan's successor.

Domain hack

A domain hack is a domain name that blends the text in a web address' domain (before the dot) with its top level domain (after the dot) to create a word (such as youtu.be), or a phrase (such as play.it). These are called "hacks" because they use top level domains in ways that they were not intended to be used. In the example above, YouTube uses .be as part of their link shortening service, even though .be was meant to be used as a country code top level domain (ccTLD) for Belgium. Entercom Communications Corporation does the same thing with their play.it domain name, using Italy's ccTLD.

Matthew Doucette first used the term "domain hack" in a blog post on November 3rd, 2004.

Dix was first elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 2005 provincial election. He led the BC NDP into the 2013 provincial election. Even though opinion polling showed that he would win the election, he lost the election to the BC Liberal Party. Because of this, he resigned as the leader of the BC NDP.

Dix was first elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 2005 provincial election. He was elected to the electoral district of Vancouver-Kingsway. He beat the incumbent Liberal MLA Rob Nijjar.

Four Ways to Forgiveness

Four Ways to Forgiveness is a collection of four short stories and novellas by American writer Ursula K. Le Guin. All four stories happen in the future. They are stories from the planets Yeowe and Werel. Both planets are members of the Ekumen. The group of Ekumen planets is the background for many novels and short stories in Le Guin's Hainish Cycle. In 2017 it was reissued as an e-book, augmented with a fifth related story by Le Guin, as Five Ways to Forgiveness.

The stories in the book are set on two planets in a distant solar system, Werel and Yeowe, inhabited by humans placed there by the ancient Hainish. (This 'Werel' is not the same as the world called Werel in Le Guin's "Planet of Exile" and "City of Illusions".) Werel has a long history of institutional enslavement of its lighter-skinned ethnic groups by its darker-skinned ethnic groups (the latter's derogatory term for the former is "dusties"). When the Ekumen recontacted the Werelians, the shock spurred one of the Werelian nations, Voe Deo, to develop a space program and settle the other inhabitable planet in the system, Yeowe, transporting a primarily slave population to do so. Eventually the slaves on Yeowe conducted a successful revolt and gained their independence, an event that occurred in the fairly recent past of the four stories. The nations of Werel are nervous that the "assets" on that planet might attempt the same thing for themselves.
The common themes of the stories are the freedom and slavery. For thousands of years, the dark-skinned "owners" of Werel kept the light-skinned "assets" as slaves. Then things began to change after the colonized the second planet, Yeowe. The Yeowans gained freedom and fought to have their own government and identity. They wanted to enter the Ekumen of worlds.

Gender relations are another important theme in the stories. At first, only male slaves were transported to Yeowe. The culture there became extremely masculine. Homosexual relationships were important and had strong effect on later gender relations on Yeowe. 

Harper Paperbacks published the book first in 1995. "Betrayals" first appeared in 1994 in "Blue Motel". The others appeared in the science fiction magazine "Asimov's" in 1994 and 1995.

"Four Ways to Forgiveness" was published in 1995 in a leather-bound, signed edition by Easton Press.

"Five Ways to Forgiveness" was published in 2017 by Penguin Random House. It was an e-book only from Rakuten Kobo and Library of America eBook Classics.

Dumont d'Urville Station

The Dumont d'Urville Station () is a French scientific station in Antarctica. It is on Île des Pétrels, archipelago of Pointe-Géologie in Adélie Land. It is named after explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville. His expedition landed on Débarquement Rock in the Dumoulin Islands at the northeast end of the archipelago on January 21, 1840. The station is run by the "French Polar Institute Paul-Émile Victor".

The first French Antarctic research station was at Port Martin, east of D'Urville. It was destroyed by fire on January 23, 1952. In 1952, a small base called Base Marret, was built on Île des Pétrels to study a rookery of emperor penguins. When the Port Martin station was destroyed, Base Marret was used in the winter of 1952/1953. A new main base, Dumont D'Urville station, was built on the same island and opened on January 12, 1956. This became the centre for French scientific research during the Antarctic International Geophysical Year 1957/1958. It has remained in active use ever since.

The station allows between 30 and 40 people to come ashore at one time. Ice and strong katabatic winds often prevent landings, either by boat or by helicopter. The station can accommodate about 30 people in winter and 120 during the summer. The icebreaker ship "L'Astrolabe" carries supplies and people to the station from the port of Hobart, Tasmania. It does five trips between November and March.

The Academy Award-winning documentary movie "La Marche de l'empereur", in English "March of the Penguins", was filmed in the region around this base.

Referential transparency

Referential transparency is a feature of parts of computer programs. A part of a program is called "referentially transparent" if it can be replaced with the value it gives back without changing the program's behavior. A referentially transparent function must be pure—it must always give the same output if it takes the same input, and it must not have any side effects—parts of the program that perform an action other than giving a value back. The opposite of referential transparency is referential opacity.

In mathematics, most functions are referentially transparent, because a mathematical function can only take values in and spit a value out. There are some exceptions, due to some historically convenient functions, which can help highlight the notion of referential transparency. For example, formula_1 means "apply the function twice", or formula_2. If making statements that apply to functions formula_3, then formula_1 means this, regardless of the function. For specific functions (usually trig functions like sine, cosine, etc), mathematicians use the square notation to mean "square the output". For example, formula_5 means formula_6 which is not the same as formula_7. This is an example of referential opacity because formula_1when formula_3 happens to be sine does not mean the same thing as formula_5, so substituting sine in for f changes the meaning of the statement.

In programming, a function might also find out what day of the year it is, or print a message to the screen. Because of this difference, some people use other names for functions in programming, like procedures.

Referential transparency lets programmers and compilers to think of code as a rewrite system—something that takes an expression and replaces it with something else. This can help with several tasks, such as:


There are several ways of doing the last task—the most well-known are memoization (saving answers after the first time), common subexpression elimination (figuring out if it is worth it to combine two parts of the code that are the same) , lazy evaluation (not finding the answer until the code really needs it), and parallelization (working on multiple problems at the same time).

Miller died at his home in Camden, London of Alzheimer's disease-related problems on 27 November 2019. He was 85.


Side effect (computer science)

A part of a program with a side effect performs a noticeable action other than giving back a value. Examples include showing a picture on a computer screen, or checking what year it is. Code with side effects can be harder to understand without any context, and the order of instructions more important for code with side effects. 

In functional programming, programmers try to avoid side effects when they can, so it is easier to prove that a program will always do what it is supposed to. In some functional languages, like Standard ML, Scheme, or Scala, side effects are not restricted, but programmers still try to use them less. In Haskell, actions with side effects must be stated explicitly—this makes it easier to tell what code does or does not have them.

Mars Climate Orbiter

The Mars Climate Orbiter was a space probe. It was launched by NASA on 11 December 1998 to study the Martian climate and Martian atmosphere. However, on 23 September 1999, communication with the spacecraft was lost, when the spacecraft was about to enter orbit. Because the computer software was working with non-SI units instead of the SI units. The spacecraft entered Mars on an orbit that brought it too close to the planet. However, what happened with the probe is still unknown, either it was destroyed in the atmosphere or entered in an orbit around the Sun after leaving the Martian atmosphere.

Scala (programming language)

Scala is a general-purpose programming language—a language that is designed for solving all kinds of problems, not just a specific one.

It provides support for functional programming, and is statically typed. It is designed to fix some problems with Java, and to be concise—to be able to express a lot with only a little bit of code.

Scala code is supposed to be compiled into Java bytecode, so Scala code can be run on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Scala has language interoperability with Java—Scala code can be used in Java programs, and the other way around.

World calendar

The World Calendar is a variation of the of the Gregorian calendar. It was created by Elisabeth Achelis of Brooklyn, New York in 1930.

The World Calendar is a 12-month, perennial calendar with 4 seasonal quarters.

Each quarter begins on Sunday and ends on Saturday. The quarters lengths are same: each has exactly 91 days, 13 weeks or 3 months. The three months have 31, 30, 30 days respectively.

The World Calendar also has two extra days outside of the week to keep the new year days as same as the Gregorian calendar.


The main critics of The World Calendar are the leaders of religions that worship according to a seven-day cycle.

Jews worship on Saturday, as in the Hebrew Bible: "Keep in memory the Sabbath and let it be a holy day" (). Christians worship on Sunday on which they believe Jesus was resurrected. Muslims worship on Friday on which they believe Adam was created. With the World calendar, their worship would change from year to year. So, the United Nations rejected the calendar.


2020 Belizean general election

The 2020 Belizean general election elected the members of the House of Representatives in the National Assembly. On 14 March 2017, Prime Minister of Belize, Dean Barrow stated that he would call for early elections in November 2019. But in March 2018, Barrow pushed back and set it for 13 February 2020. On 22 May 2019, Barrow insisted that there would be no General election before 1 November 2020 in Belize. 

The Deadline for nominations was 21 October 2020, with political Campaigning lasting for four Weeks until Polling day on 11 November 2020. On the Day of the Election, Polling stations across the Country opened from 7 am, and closed at 10 pm. It was the third to be held in November since 1979.
Individuals eligible to vote have to be registered to vote by Midnight on 26 September 2020. To be eligible to vote, Individuals had to be aged 18 or over; residing as a Commonwealth citizen at an address in Belize, or a Belizean citizen overseas who registered to Vote in the last 15 years and not legally excluded (on grounds of detainment in Prison, a Mental hospital, or on the run from Law enforcement) or disqualified from Voting. Anyone who qualified as an Anonymous elector will have until midnight on 26 October to Register.

The previous general election was held on 4 November 2015, and the new National Assembly was opened on 13 November 2015, which was also the date that the first sitting of the National Assembly of Belize began after the 2015 Belizean general election. According to Section 84 of the Constitution of Belize, the National Assembly of Belize (House of Representatives and Senate) must be dissolved every “five years from the date when the two Houses, first met” unless dissolved sooner by the Governor-General of Belize upon the advice of the Prime Minister. A general election must be called within three months of a dissolution, meaning the latest possible date for Barrow to call the next Belizean general election is on 13 February 2021. If by any chance the next Belizean general election is not held by 13 February 2021, Barrow may be forced to vacate the office of Prime Minister, however he may still remain as Leader of the United Democratic Party (UDP), but he will have to make a Snap! decision on a Caretaker Prime Minister of Belize to formally announce a date for the next general election. The Caretaker Prime Minister must be from the ruling, UDP and must also be a Cabinet minister in government.

Despite the five-year term of the National Assembly, three of the last four general elections have been called at least a year early. Both Prime Minister, Dean Barrow and Leader of the Opposition, Johnny Briceño of the People’s United Party (PUP) are on record supporting lowering the maximum five-year term of the National Assembly of Belize to four years. This was also one of the promises that Briceño promised the People of Belize should the PUP be elected in the next election.
Barrow first declared on 1 March 2016 that he would be stepping down as Prime Minister on 13 February 2020 and was finding a suitable successor. He also told the Media that the next election is likely to be held in early 2020 and also scheduled a UDP Leadership convention and election in May 2019. His remarks came as he was being questioned about the then pending United Democratic Party First Deputy Leadership election and convention. On 1 April 2017, at the Belize Chamber of Commerce and Industry annual general meeting Barrow narrowed down his departure as Prime Minister to less than a year and stated that he will retire in March 2018. He also narrowed down the date of the Leadership convention to 13 February 2018. He also declared that “Since this will be my last opportunity to address your annual gathering, I close by saying how thankful I am for what has in the main been a constructive relationship with the Chamber”.

In early 2017, Barrow was ailing with excruciating back pain; a serious condition that he was enduring for some time. He could barely sit upright without visible signs of pain on his face, It is understandable then, that in such a poor and un-stabilised state of health he would welcome retirement. But on 1 September 2018, things changed, after enduring the back pain for more than a year, Barrow went to Cuba and requested the Doctors in a hospital there to perform a Spinal Surgery. The Cuban Doctors did as they were told by Barrow and they also did a phenomenal job. The surgery was a success and after one week of rest and recovery, Barrow returned to perfect health. So after the surgery was over, Barrow rescheduled his retirement once again this time to December 2019 and hinted he could do so earlier and also rescheduled the date for the UDP’s Leadership convention back to May 2019.

On 18 November 2018, Barrow’s cabinet urged him to remain as Prime Minister until the 2020 general election. They also urged him to remain as Leader of the UDP until February 2020. He said he will take that move and eventually for the final time, rescheduled the convention to February 2020. On 4 December 2018, Minister of Human Development and Minister of Social Transformation, Anthony Martinez revealed to the media on why he and the Cabinet urged Barrow to remain as Prime Minister until 2020. Martinez stayed on course saying that Barrow ultimately took the decision and that the goal is for the currently leadership to take the UDP into a fourth term in government. A fourth term will be historic for the UDP as no political party in post-independence Belize has ever had a fourth term. Plus this will also be a major upset for the majority of Belizeans who were expecting the PUP to win at the next election.

With the exception of the Belize Progressive Party, led by Patrick Rogers in the 2015 elections, all parties were contesting under first-time leaders.

Kingdom of Koya

The Kingdom of Kquoja or Koya or Koya Temne, or the Temne Kingdom (1505–1896), was a pre-colonial African state. It was located in the north of Sierra Leone. Its capital was at Cape Mount in what is now Liberia.

The kingdom was founded by the Temne ethnic group in or around 1505. Migrants from the north who wanted to trade with the Portuguese in the south founded the kingom. 

It was ruled by a king called a Bai or Obai. The sub-kingdoms within the state were ruled by nobles titled "Gbana". The Koya Kingdom kept and maintained diplomatic relations with the British and French in the 18th century. Children of Temne nobles were allowed to get western educations abroad. Koya also traded with Islamic states to its north and had Muslims within its borders.

Under Nembanga's reign (1775–1793), the Koya kingdom signed a treaty which made it possible for the establishment of a British colony on the peninsula of Sierra Leone in 1788.

Koya participated in the trans-atlantic slave trade, though sources state that such commerce was much more privatized than in other kingdoms. Subjects of Koya traded in slaves on the coast even against the wishes of the state at times.

From 1801 to 1807, Koya fought a war with British colonists and the Susu. Koya lost the northern shoreline of Sierra Leone to the British and Port Loko to the Susu. However, they remained a power in the region. In 1815, the Temne fought another war with the Susu and regained the port. In 1841, the Temne defeated the Loko tribe of Kasona on the Mabaole River dispersing many of the people. In response to a British bombardment, the kingdom expelled the Church Missionary Society missionaries operating at Magbela in 1860.

The kingdom became a British protectorate August 31, 1896. At that point the Koya kings lost almost all power. Revolts of the Temne and Mende in 1898 were fierce but futile. The British would govern the area of the former kingdom until 1961.

Colchagua (historical province)

The historical province of Colchagua was one of the regions of Chile, between 1826 and 1976. Its capital was located in San Fernando during most of its existence. For some years, Curicó and Rancagua were capitals of Colchagua.

The province of Colchagua was one of the eight provinces of Chile (Coquimbo, Aconcagua, Santiago, Colchagua, Maule, Concepción, Valdivia, and Chiloé) created by the federal laws of 31 January 1826. Its territory comprised former delegations of Colchagua, Curicó and Talca. The province was sanctioned by the 1828 Constitution.

During its early years, Colchagua was divided into the departments of San Fernando (cap. San Fernando), Curicó (cap. Curicó), and Talca (cap. Talca).

In 1833, a new Constitution reorganized the country, creating departments, subdelegations and districts as lower entities of provinces. Later that year, by law dated August, the department of Talca was separated to create the province of Talca, and in 1834, the department of Caupolicán was created, with Rengo as its capital.

Although the title of provincial capital was disputed by San Fernando, Curicó and Talca a September 1840 decree established San Fernando as the capital.

In 1865, the department of Curicó was separated from Colchagua, in order to create the province of Curicó.

On 17 September 1925, by Law Decree N.° 529, the department of San Vicente was created, separated from Caupolicán.

In 1928, the government of Carlos Ibáñez del Campo decided to reorganize the provinces of Chile, by Decree with Law Force N.° 8.582 dated 28 January 1929. The new province of Colchagua incorporated the departments of Rancagua (cap. Rancagua) and Cachapoal (cap. Peumo), originally from the province of O'Higgins, and the department of Santa Cruz (cap. Santa Cruz), which belonged to the province of Curicó.

Because of public discontent, the former provinces of O'Higgins and Colchagua were re-established by Law 5.376, in January 1934. Colchagua kept the departments of San Fernando and Santa Cruz. In 1973, under the government of Salvador Allende, the department of Cardenal Caro was created (cap. Marchigüe).

In July 1974, a new reform took place, directed by the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, who created regions. On 1 January 1976, the new VI Región (Sixth Region) came into existence, with the territory of former provinces of O'Higgins and Colchagua. Former departments of San Fernando, Santa Cruz and Cardenal Caro were supressed. In 1979, the region was renamed VI Región del Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins (Sixth Region of Liberator General Bernardo O'Higgins, in short, Region of O'Higgins). Its territory comprises current provinces of Cachapoal, Colchagua and Cardenal Caro.

Wonder Stories

Wonder Stories is an early American science fiction magazine. It was published under several titles from 1929 to 1955. Hugo Gernsback started the magazine after he had lost control of his first science fiction magazine, "Amazing Stories".

"Air Wonder Stories" and "Science Wonder Stories" were merged in 1930 as "Wonder Stories". The magazines were not financially successful, and in 1936 Gernsback sold "Wonder Stories" to Ned Pines at Beacon Publications, where, retitled "Thrilling Wonder Stories", it continued for nearly 20 years. The last issue was dated Winter 1955, and the title was then merged with "Startling Stories", another of Pines' science fiction magazines.

The editors under Gernsback's ownership were David Lasser, who worked hard to improve the quality of the fiction, and, from mid-1933, Charles Hornig.

Gernsback's new magazine, "Amazing Stories", was successful, but Gernsback lost control of the publisher when it went bankrupt in February 1929.

Gernsback claimed that science fiction was educational.

In 1930, Gernsback decided to merge "Science Wonder Stories" and "Air Wonder Stories" into "Wonder Stories". 

The first issue of the merged magazine appeared in June 1930, still on a monthly schedule, with Lasser as editor.

"Wonder Stories" had a circulation of about 25,000 in 1934.

Pines' magazines included several with "Thrilling" in the title, such as "Thrilling Detective" and "Thrilling Love Stories".

The title was changed to "Thrilling Wonder Stories" to match the rest of the "Thrilling" line. The first issue appeared in August 1936—four months after the last Gernsback "Wonder Stories" appeared.

Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have also carried out attacks, with AQAP controlling swathes of territory in the hinterlands, and along stretches of the coast. On 21 March 2015, after taking over Sanaʽa and the Yemeni government, the Houthi-led Supreme Revolutionary Committee declared a general mobilization to overthrow Hadi and expand their control by driving into southern provinces. The Houthi offensive, allied with military forces loyal to Saleh, began fighting the next day in Lahij Governorate. By 25 March, Lahij fell to the Houthis and they reached the outskirts of Aden, the seat of power for Hadi's government. Hadi fled the country the same day. At the same time, a coalition led by Saudi Arabia launched military operations by using air strikes to restore the former Yemeni government. The United States provided intelligence and logistical support for the campaign. 
According to the UN and other sources, from March 2015 to December 2017, between 8,670–13,600 people were killed in Yemen, including more than 5,200 civilians. They estimated more than 50,000 have died as a result of an ongoing famine due to the war. With Iran suporting the Huthi and Saudi Arabia opposing them, the conflict has been widely seen as a proxy war and a means for Saudi Arabia to combat Iranian influence in the region. 
In 2018, the United Nations warned that 13 million Yemeni civilians face starvation in what it says could become "the worst famine in the world in 100 years." The international community sharply condemned the Saudi Arabian-led bombing campaign, which included widespread bombing of civilian areas. The bombing campaign has killed or injured an estimated 17,729 civilians as of March 2019 according to the Yemen Data Project. Despite this, the crisis gained less international media attention than the Syrian civil war. The US has been providing bombs to aid the Saudi forces and airstrikes in Yemen. In March 2019, this led the US senate to pass a resolution to end US support of Saudi Arabia. It was vetoed by President of the United States Donald Trump, and in May, the Senate failed to override the veto.

Gangkhar Puensum

Gangkhar Puensum is a mountain in the Himalayas range, in Bhutan and Tibet. It is the 40th highest mountain in the world. It is also known as Kangkar Pünzum. The name means "White Peak of the Three Spiritual Brothers". No one has ever made it to the top of Gangkhar Puensum. It is the highest unclimbed mountain in the world.

Details about the mountain have not always been correct. It was first measured in 1922, but not all maps showed the same height. There was also confusion on the location of the mountain. Some maps showed it in different places than others. Due to this confusion, the first team to try to climb it wasn’t even able to find it at all. The present listed height and location are from China, as Bhutan has not surveyed the mountain.

A few people have tried to climb the mountain in the past, but none succeeded. In 1994, Bhutan made a law that no one could climb above . Then in 2003, they banned all climbing. As long as the ban is in place, it is unlikely that anyone will reach the top from the Bhutan side. While it may be possible to start the climb in Tibet, China has not allowed it. Tibet is an autonomous region of the People's Republic of China (PRC). This is a political decision due to issues in the border region between China and Bhutan. There is a border dispute between the two countries.

Contour integral

In complex analysis, contour integration is a way to calculate an integral around a contour on the complex plane. In other words, it is a way of integrating along the complex plane.

More specifically, given a complex-valued function formula_1 and a contour formula_2, the contour integral of formula_1 along formula_2 is written as formula_5 or formula_6.

For a standard contour integral, we can evaluate it by using the residue theorem. This theorem states that 

formula_7

where formula_8 is the residue of the function formula_9, formula_2 is the contour located on the complex plane. Here, formula_9 is the integrand of the function, or part of the integral to be integrated.

The following examples illustrate how contour integrals can be calculated using the residue theorem.

To solve multivariable contour integrals (contour integrals on functions of several variables), such as surface integrals, complex volume integrals and higher order integrals, we must use the divergence theorem. For right now, let formula_14 be interchangeable with formula_15. These will both serve as the divergence of the vector field written as formula_16. This theorem states that:

formula_17

In addition, we also need to evaluate formula_18, where formula_19 is an alternate notation of formula_20. The divergence of any dimension can be described as

The following examples illustrate the use of divergence theorem in the calculation of multivariate contour integrals.

Let the vector field formula_22 be bounded by the following conditions

The corresponding double contour integral would be set up as such:

We now evaluate formula_24 by setting up the corresponding triple integral:

From this, we can now evaluate the integral as follows:

formula_26
Given the vector field formula_27 and formula_28 being the fourth dimension. Let this vector field be bounded by the following:

To evaluate this, we use the divergence theorem as stated before, and evaluate formula_24 afterwards. Let formula_31, then:

From this, we now can evaluate the integral:

Thus, we can evaluate a contour integral of the fourth dimension.

Nana Saheb Peshwa II

Nana Saheb (19 May 1824 – 24 September 1859), born as Dhondu Pant, was an Indian Peshwa of the Maratha empire. An aristocrat and fighter, he led the rebellion in Cawnpore (Kanpur) during the 1857 uprising. 

As the adopted son of the exiled Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao II, Nana Sahib believed that he should get a pension from the English East India Company, but he didnt get one and joined the mutiny. 

Nana Sahib won the confidence of Charles Hillersdon, the Collector of Kanpur. It was planned that Nana Sahib would assemble a force of 1,500 soldiers to support the British, in case the rebellion spread to Cawnpore.

On 6 June 1857, at the time of the rebellion by forces of the East India Company at Cawnpore, the British contingent had taken refuge at an entrenchment in the northern part of the town. Amid the prevailing chaos in Cawnpore, Nana and his forces entered the British magazine in the northern part of the town. However, once he entered the magazine, Nana Sahib announced that he was a participant in the rebellion against the Company, and intended to be a vassal of Bahadur Shah II.

After taking possession of the Company treasury, Nana advanced up the Grand Trunk Road stating that he wanted to restore the Maratha confederacy under the Peshwa tradition, and decided to capture Cawnpore. On his way, Nana met the rebel Company soldiers at Kalyanpur. The soldiers were on their way to Delhi, to meet Bahadur Shah II. Nana wanted them to go back to Cawnpore, and help him defeat the British. The soldiers were reluctant at first, but decided to join Nana when he promised to double their pay and reward them with gold, if they were to destroy the British entrenchment.

He later disappeared, after his forces were defeated by a British force that recaptured Cawnpore. He went to the Nepal Hills where he probably died on 24 September 1859.

Housing in the United States

Housing is an important part of the US economy. It is about 15% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Housing contributes to both the private investment component of the GDP as well as the consumption component.

This is the part of the GDP that comes from construction, renovation, and home purchase fees. In 2000 it contributed $425 billion or 4% to the GDP (25% to the private investment component)

This is the part of the GDP comes from real estate rentals. In 2000 it contributed $959 billion, or 10% to the GDP (14% of the personal consumption component).

Homes in 2019 in the United States were least affordable to purchase compared to any other year in the last ten last years. This is because home prices are increasing much faster than wages. According to USA Today, cities with large universities were a good choice for university students after they graduate. For example, Madison in Wisconsin, which has a large University called the University of Wisconsin-Madison, has very affordable housing.

Judith Scott (artist)

Judith Scott (May 1, 1943 – March 15, 2005) was an internationally recognized fiber artist. She was born with Down Syndrome and became deaf as an infant. From age 7 she lived in an institution for 35 years. She did not begin her art career until her mid-40s, then worked until her death 18 years later.

Judith was born into a middle-class family in Cincinnati, Ohio, along with her non-identical twin sister Joyce. Unlike Joyce, Judith was born with Down Syndrome. As a baby, Judith was sick with scarlet fever, which caused her to lose her hearing. This fact remained undiagnosed until much later in her life. She never learned to speak or use sign language.

At the age of seven, Judith was sent to live in a state care facility in Ohio. She stayed in that institution for thirty-five years, until her sister. In 1987 Judith was enrolled at the Creative Growth Art Center in Oakland, California which supports people with developmental disabilities. There, Judith discovered her passion and talent for abstract fiber art.

The story of the Scott sisters' lives, "Entwined – Sisters and secrets in the life of artist Judith Scott", has been written by her twin sister. It was published in 2016.

Each day, she would spend hours wrapping found objects in colored yarn, string, paper and fabric strips. Some of the resulting sculptures were completed during a day’s labor; others over weeks or months. While Scott had no style per se, each of the wrapped sculptures has its distinct personality; all convey a sense of inner life. The originating object is mostly unrecognizable, as in Franz West’s more famous plaster or epoxy “Adaptives,” which similarly incorporate largely unidentifiable items and are likewise portable.

At the Brooklyn Museum, some 45 Scott sculptures are on display, resting on a low white platform. On the wall are 15 mixed-media drawings completed at the beginning of her art-making career. Scott never indicated a “correct” way to show the three-dimensional works, so they are displayed casually, as she might have worked on them.

Citypoint

Citypoint (previously known as Britannic House and Britannic Tower) is a skyscraper located on Ropemaker Street on the northern part of the City of London, the main financial district and historic center of London.

Originally named Britannic House, Citypoint was built in 1967 as a 35-storey, tall headquarters for British Petroleum (now BP). This became the first building in the City of London area to pass the height of St Paul's Cathedral. The designers were F. Milton Cashmore and H. N. W. Grosvenor. In 1991 British Petroleum moved back to their original headquarters on Finsbury Circus and the building was renamed Britannic Tower.

It was refurbished in 2000, with additional floor space and the height increased to . Sheppard Robson helped to improve the building. It was then renamed to Citypoint.

Citypoint is the seventh-tallest building in the City, after the Heron Tower, 122 Leadenhall Street, Tower 42, 30 St Mary Axe, Broadgate Tower and 20 Fenchurch Street but only the 23rd-tallest in Greater London.

In August 2005 its owner, Pillar Properties, sold the building for more than £500 million in one of the largest deals ever seen in the City office market.

In early 2007 the building was again put on the market, this time for £650 million, and purchased by a private American company called Beacon Capital Partners. At the time it was the most expensive building sale in the United Kingdom. However 8 Canada Square at Canary Wharf eclipsed this by some margin just a few months later when it was sold for over £1 billion.

A number of other large buildings are planned on sites nearby. These include a 43-storey, residential tower at Milton Court. A office tower at Ropemaker Place has also been developed by British Land.

Christian radio

Christian radio is a kind of radio station that has mostly Christian programs. Some Christian radio stations play Christian music. Some Christian radio stations have talk or news programs.

Since the early days of broadcasting, some stations have included Church services, sermons, and Christian Music. The first AM experimental broadcast was on Christmas Eve, and included a violin playing religious music. Christian programs were common by the time radio became popular in the 1920s. 

Christian Radio can follow many different formats. In fact, for most every secular radio format there is a corresponding Christian format. The only exception may be the "shock jock" format. 
Some of the popular Christian formats would be "Oldies" (traditional music), Black Gospel, Southern Gospel, "Rock", Talk, Worship, sermons, etc. In addition many Christian stations use languages other than the majority language of their country. Because of these language and format possibilities, a large city may have a dozen or more Christian stations without much overlap in their programming. 

While Evangelical groups have by far the most stations, there are also Roman Catholic radio stations. Liberal Christian groups make some programs, but few own their own stations, preferring to buy time on other, usually secular stations. 

Some Christian stations seek to target a particular group such as youth, elderly, women or other groups. Many Christian stations produce programs that are mainly of interest to those who are already committed Christians. Others seek to do evangelism, and have music and programs that might attract those who are not already Christians.

Many Christian Stations operate as non-commercial stations. They get most of their financial support from listeners or those who donate in order to influence the listeners. Other stations operate as commercial stations, that is, they carry advertisements to cover the cost of the operation. 

The number of radio stations in the U.S. with a Christian format has grown greatly in the 21st Century. This is partly because some AM stations could not compete as commercial stations and were bought by Christian groups to operate as non-commercial or semi-commercial Christian stations. Also more opportunities for FM stations came about with changes in FCC rules. Many countries which used to have only government stations began to allow other groups to have radio stations. This increased the number of Christian stations outside the U.S.

There are many Christian stations that operate with a Missionary purpose. They broadcast the Christian message to countries and groups where there are large numbers of persons who are not Christians, or who are Christians with limited access to churches or Christian teaching. These stations consider themselves "Missionary Radio" stations, as opposed to Stations that mainly serve the needs of persons in majority Christian countries. Another distinction between Christian radio and Missionary Radio is that with Missionary Radio, the funding almost never comes from the people being served, whereas in Christian radio is often is from them. 

In the past when many countries, for example the Communist block, limited Christian activities, the Missionary stations were very active in broadcasting in many languages and to many places.Some of these countries now allow more local Christian activity. However other countries still limit the work of missionaries and so radio is still used. In some countries only government stations can operate. Stations outside the country are the only way to provide service into those countries. To provide the longer range coverage, shortwave is often used by Missionary stations, although super power AM is also sometimes used.

Abortion debate

Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy. For decades, induced abortion is a subject that is controversial. Each person has a system of moral values. Based on their system of morals, people have different opinions about it. Religion can also influence this opinion.
A number of opinion polls have been carried out around the world. They have tried to find out what people think about abortion. Results were different for different countries, but also varied with the questions that were asked.

In May 2005, a survey was done in ten European countries. The people were asked, if they could agree with the statement: "If a woman does not want children, she should be allowed to have an abortion". The highest level of approval was 81% in the Czech Republic; the lowest was 47% in Poland.

A poll was done in November 2001. The poll asked people in Canada in what circumstances they believed an abortion should be permitted. 32% responded that they believe abortion should be legal in all circumstances, 52% that it should be legal in certain circumstances, and 14% that it should never be legal. A similar poll in April 2009 surveyed people in the United States about abortion; 18% said that abortion should be "legal in all cases", 28% said that abortion should be "legal in most cases", 28% said abortion should be "illegal in most cases" and 16% said abortion should be "illegal in all cases". In a Gallup poll taken in July 2011, however, 47% of Americans identified themselves as pro-life and the same percentage of Americans identified themselves as pro-choice. A November 2005 poll in Mexico found that 73.4% think abortion should not be legalized while 11.2% think it should.

Of attitudes in South America, a December 2003 survey found that 30% of Argentines thought that abortion should be allowed in Argentina "regardless of situation", 47% that it should be allowed "under some circumstances", and 23% that it should not be allowed "regardless of situation". A March 2007 poll about abortion in Brazil found that 65% of Brazilians believe that it "should not be modified", 16% that it should be expanded "to allow abortion in other cases", 10% that abortion should be "decriminalized", and 5% were "not sure". A July 2005 poll in Colombia found that 65.6% said they thought that abortion should remain illegal, 26.9% that it should be made legal, and 7.5% that they were unsure.

Some people have strong feelings about abortion. People who think that the law should let women choose to have abortions are called "pro-choice". People who think that abortion is wrong and that the law should not allow it are called "pro-life".

People who are pro-choice believe that women should be allowed to have control over their own bodies when it comes to ending or continuing a pregnancy. They believe that, because the embryo or fetus is inside the woman's body and does not have developed enough organs to survive on its own until later in the pregnancy, it is not yet a person with rights. Pro-choice people also make the argument that abortion needs to be legal in order to protect women, because when abortion is illegal, it does not completely stop abortions from happening, but makes it so that women try to do abortions on themselves or get them done by people who are not trained doctors, which puts those women in danger of death or injury. Pro-choice people believe the way to prevent abortion is to make sure women only get pregnant when they want to. In addition to advocating the legality of abortion, pro-choice groups like Planned Parenthood often try to improve people's access to things used to prevent pregnancy (called "contraception"), and try to teach young people about sex to reduce the number of teen pregnancies.

People who are pro-life believe that all humans, including the unborn, have a right to life. For this reason, they believe abortion is wrong and that it is murder. They think the law should make abortion a crime in order to protect innocent life within the womb. However, though pro-life people think abortion is wrong, there are rare cases in which "some" pro-life people would allow an abortion to happen, like if the pregnancy puts the woman's life at risk or if she got pregnant from rape. Pro-life people think women who are pregnant and do not want to raise a child should look for alternatives to abortion such as giving the baby up for adoption. There are many crisis pregnancy centers pro-life people have started to discourage women from having abortions. They have also started advocacy groups, like the American Life League, Feminists for Life and Live Action, to try to convince more people to believe that abortion is wrong and to try to get governments to make laws to restrict abortion. Some pro-life people have used violence to try to stop abortions from happening. However, most people who are against abortion do not do such wrong things and so they try to stop abortions from happening through peaceful activism.

Many religions have a view on abortion. These views span a broad spectrum from acceptance to rejection. Most religions generally oppose abortion.

Generally, when there is a debate about whether abortion laws should be changed in a country, there are advocacy groups. Some of the arguments these groups often have are outlined below.

There is a hypothesis that induced abortion raises the risk of getting breast cancer. People who support this, call it a "link", rather than a "hypothesis".
The subject has been controversial, but currently, scientists agree that there is no link between abortion in the first trimester, and increasing the risk to get breast cancer.

In early pregnancy, levels of estrogen increase. This causes the breast to grow, and to prepare for lactation. In the 1890s, studies were done on rats, before this hypothesis was put forward.

It is currently unclear from what moment the embryo or fetus can feel pain. This is also used in the debate about abortion. Many researchers think that a fetus is unlikely to feel pain until after the seventh month of pregnancy. Others disagree. At about twenty-six weeks of pregnancy, certain connections are made in the thalamus of the growing fetus. Developmental neurobiologists suspect that these connections may be critical to perception of pain by the fetus. However, legislation has been proposed by pro-life advocates requiring abortion providers to tell a woman that the embryo or fetus may feel pain during an abortion procedure.

Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco published a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study analyzed data from dozens of medical reports and other studies. The researchers concluded that fetuses are unlikely to feel pain until the third trimester of pregnancy. However a number of medical critics have since disputed these conclusions. There are certain connections in the thalamus of the fetuse. These connections develop at about twenty-six weeks of pregnancy. At the end of the 20th century there was an emerging consensus among developmental neurobiologists that these connections are very important when it comes to the perception of pain in the fetus. Other researchers such as Anand and Fisk have challenged this late date, positing that pain can be felt around twenty weeks.
Pain can have many different aspects: It might be purely relying on sensory input, but it might also involve emotions and thought. For this reason, it is perhaps impossible to know exactly when the embryo or fetus feels pain, even if it has developed the links in the thalamus.

Created in November 2018 as the Brexit Party it changed its name to Reform UK in January 2021. It was led by Nigel Farage until March 2021 when Richard Tice became its new and current leader.

Many of its members were formerly of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), with Farage having led UKIP in 2006–09 and 2010–16, as well as from the Conservative Party.

On 6 January 2021, the party was re-registered as Reform UK. Farage stepped down as leader in March 2021, being replaced by party chairman Richard Tice.

Before the general election on 8 December 2019, the party's leader Nigel Farage said that, after Brexit, the party would change its name to the "Reform Party", and campaign for changes in the electoral system and structure of the House of Commons.

In October 2020, Farage and Tice said they had gone to the Electoral Commission, which handles elections, to re-name the Brexit Party to 'Reform UK', and said that the party would campaign against more lockdowns (because of the COVID-19 pandemic) and that would seek to reform parts of UK Governance, including the BBC and House of Lords. In a report, Nigel Farage said he and the party supported the Great Barrington Declaration, which tries to remove restrictions and let the lower risk people be infected and become immune and unable to infect the elderly and vulnerable or cause them to die.

A poll by YouGov said that the amount of voters with a good opinion of Nigel Farage and those with a negative opinion of COVID-19 lockdowns was at about 7% of voters. The charity Reform, which has the domain name reform.uk, had complained to the Electoral Commission about the name change, saying that it could be hurting its reputation through name confusion.

On 6 January 2021, the party's name change to Reform UK was approved by the electoral commission.

In the Indian subcontinent pre-natal sex is banned as some people kill their daughters or get an abortion done because of the want of male children.

Redwood National and State Parks

The Redwood National and State Parks (RNSP) are a group of state and national parks in the United States. They are on the coast of northern California. These parks include Redwood National Park, Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park, Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, and Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. Together, the parks contain ,

The parks have old-growth temperate rainforests. The four parks include 45% of all remaining coast redwood forests. These total at least . These trees are the tallest and one of the biggest trees on Earth. In addition to the redwood forests, the parks protect much nature within the area.

In 1850, old-growth redwood forest covered more than of the California coast. The northern part of that area was noticed by lumbermen and others when a gold rush brought them to the region. As they did not become rich from gold, these men decided to log the gigantic trees. The timber went to San Francisco and other places on the West Coast.

After many decades of logging, efforts were started in conservation. In the 1920s the Save the Redwoods League worked to save old-growth redwoods. Due to their efforts, a number of State Parks were formed. Then in 1968, Redwood National Park was created. By that time nearly 90% of the original redwood trees had been logged. The National Park Service (NPS) and the California Department of Parks and Recreation (CDPR) combined the management of Redwood National Park with the three Redwood State Parks in 1994.

The ecosystem of the RNSP preserves a number of threatened animal species. These include the tidewater goby, Chinook salmon, northern spotted owl, and Steller's sea lion. The United Nations made the parks a World Heritage Site on 5 September 1980. Other parts of the area were added on 30 June 1983.

Imposter syndrome

Imposter syndrome is a bias in thinking in which the individual believes all of their accomplishments to be the result of coincidence and luck instead of actual skill. This is often combined with the fear of being revealed as a "fraud" or "imposter" who does not deserve the things they have obtained in life.

People experiencing the imposter syndrome feel they do not belong in their environment, because they think others know more and can do things better. This often happens in relation to studying or work, but can also apply to personal relationships with other people. In the case of relationships with other people, those with imposter syndrome worry that they are not good at what they do as well. They believe they are not a good partner, colleague or friend and that they have tricked others into liking them.

Imposter syndrome is also feeling colleagues and authorities value you more than they should. Praise (when someone says you did well) often results in being shocked and not believing in what is said about you. Another trait is thinking your achievements and success are effects of luck, mistakes or bias. That is why these do not convince people that they are intelligent and still cause them to believe they do not deserve to be where they are. These people often refer to themselves as ‘impostors’.

Impostors worry that someone else will discover their true nature. This would have negative effects, like losing a job or others’ trust. To avoid this, they try to prevent anyone from finding out.

Those with impostor syndrome have a high chance of also being perfectionists. This means they wish to do everything without errors. They also very often procrastinate (put off things to do for later), because when they do, whether they succeed or fail, they can think it was because of good or bad luck.

The clinical symptoms associated with imposter syndrome include anxiety, fear of failure, depression, decreased mental health, lower self-esteem, feelings of guilt and humiliation and frustration. 

The imposter syndrome has also been found to be linked to some traits from the Big Five personality traits. Negativity, depression and anxiety are common in both neuroticism (one of the Big Five character traits) and imposter phenomenon. The two are then highly linked together. People with imposter syndrome have low conscientiousness (another Big Five character trait) because of low self self-esteem and low feeling of competence (being able to do things successfully).

Some people are more likely to experience imposter syndrome. These include: 





Some researchers say women experience feeling like an impostor more often than men, but others say they experience it equally frequently.

The ones that agree have found that women on average believe they are able to successfully do tasks less than men. When they do succeed they think it is because of external (not relating to them directly) causes, like luck. When they fail, women think it is because they do not have the necessary abilities. With men, it is the opposite case. When they succeed, they think it is because of internal (directly related to them) causes like being smart and their abilities. However, when they fail they blame it on bad luck or the task being too hard.

Other researchers have found that men are less likely than women to accept and deal with imposter syndrome. They feel the need to have a typical ‘man’s job’, like a mechanic or engineer, and not the ones assumed to be more of a ‘woman’s job’, like a nurse or teacher. Having an imposter syndrome, they avoid feeling different and without talent or abilities in the more woman-typical job. They would rather pick a job where they will not differ as much.

Many things have been suggested to be done to reduce the feelings of being an imposter.

Causes of World War I

The First World War lasted from 1914 to 1918. It was caused by the buildup of tension between countries. The three long-term causes were the formation of empires, the accumulation of armies and weapons, and alliances. The trigger cause was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

One of the causes of World War I was that countries wanted to form empires. This is called "imperialism". From the late 1800s, the power of an empire is judged by its size. Britain had the largest empire, with lots of territories overseas, such as India. People would say "The sun never sets on the British Empire" because there were British holdings all over the world, so it was always day in some part of the empire. One way in which empires expanded their 

the Morocco Crisis, where the European superpowers colonised African nations obtained raw materials in order to fuel their economic growth. Furthermore, France was entitled to being the policeman over Morocco, but this escalated tensions with Germany to the extent that they sent the warship Panther. 

The second long term reason is In order to conquer far-away places on different continents, imperial powers built large armies and navies and the cultures valued fighting. This was called "militarism". Countries spent large amounts of money in a short amount of time to build these armies. In the early 1900s, Britain's navy was the biggest. This made their traditional rival, Germany want to make a big navy too. When Britain launched a new kind of ship called the Dreadnought, Germany launched their own version of the Dreadnought to compete with Britain.

The third long-term cause was "alliances". The bigger countries of Europe formed two sides. They were called the "Triple Entente" and the "Triple Alliance." The Triple Entente included France, Great Britain, and Russia. The Triple Alliance was Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. Great Britain, France, and Russia were worried about the growing strength of Germany, so they promised to help each other if any one of them was attacked. Germany objected to this arrangement because, with France and Great Britain on the west and Russia on the east, Germany would be surrounded. So Germany formed an alliance with Austria-Hungary and Italy.

The trigger cause of World War I was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, who was next in line to be emperor of Austro-Hungary. He was killed in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914. He and his wife, Countess Sophie, both died. They were making a state visit to the capital of Bosnia. A Serbian secret society, the Black Hand, wanted Bosnia to break free from the Austro-Hungarian Empire and be a country by itself. They were supported by Russia. The Archduke and his wife arrived at 9:30 a.m. and got into an open-topped car at the train station. Members of the Black Hand had learned the route they would take to their destination. When the time came, one of them threw a hand grenade at the Archduke's car. It bounced off the back of the car, which drove on. It injured the driver and passengers in the car behind the Archduke instead. When the Archduke realized he was a target he immediately abandoned his planned trip and went to visit a hospital instead. However, the driver took a wrong turn up Franz Joseph Street and had to reverse. By chance, he slowed down in front of Gavrilo Princip, leader of the Black Hand. Seeing that this was his only chance to carry out his plan, he pulled his gun and fired, killing the Archduke, Sophie, who had been pregnant at the time. Gavrilo Princip was arrested and beaten up for this rebellious act. on the street in June 28, 1914. 

Austria-Hungary was outraged that the heir to their throne had been killed. They blamed Serbia and bombed the capital, Belgrade. The Serbians tried to surrender, but Austria-Hungary bombed them anyway. Serbia's ally, Russia, then helped to defend it from attack. Soon after, Germany, Austria-Hungary's ally, declared war on Russia as well as starting to move towards French territory, ready to invade, attacking Belgium as they progressed. The French soldiers started to get ready for a German invasion. When Germany declared war on France, then under the terms of the Triple Entente, Britain then ordered Germany to stop attacking Belgium, who was neutral during the war. When the Germans didn't retreat from Belgium, Britain declared war on Germany. Finally, Austria-Hungary declared war on Russia and WWI commenced.

Battle royale game

A battle royale game is an online multiplayer video game genre that combines survival, exploration, and scavenging (collecting useful items) in a game where only one can remain, also known as a last-man-standing game. Battle royale games usually have a large number of players, ranging from tens to hundreds. They start with almost nothing and then try to defeat all other enemies/players while trying to stay inside of a play zone or "safe area" that gets smaller over time. The winner is the last player or team alive. The name for the genre is taken from the 2000 Japanese movie "Battle Royale".

The genre's origins arose from mods for large-scale online survival games like "Minecraft" and "ARMA 2" in the early 2010s. By the end of the decade, the genre became a cultural phenomenon, with standalone games such as "PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds", "Fortnite Battle Royale" and "Apex Legends" each having received tens of millions of players within months of their release.

Battle royale games are played between a lot of single players, pairs of two players or a number of small teams (usually 3-5 players). The goal is to be the last player or team standing by defeating all other enemies. It starts by placing the player-characters into a large map, typically by having all players skydive from a large aircraft within a short time limit. The map may have the players randomly placed or allow players to have some control over where they start. They start with very little equipment, giving no player an obvious advantage at the start. Equipment, usually used for fighting, survival or transport, is randomly placed around the map, often at landmarks on the map, such as within buildings in ghost towns. Players need to search the map for these items while trying to avoid being killed by other players, who cannot be visually marked or revealed either on-screen or on the map, making the player use only their own eyes and ears to find their positions. Equipment from defeated players can usually be taken as well. These games often include some way to push enemies closer together as the game progresses, usually taking the form of a safe zone that slowly gets smaller, with players outside the zone eventually being killed.

Normally, battle royale players are only given one life to play; any players who die are not allowed to respawn. Games with team support may allow players to enter a temporary, near-death state once health is depleted, giving allies the opportunity to revive them before they give out or are finished off by an enemy. The match is over when only one player or team is left, and the game usually provides some type of reward, such as in-game currency used for cosmetic items, to all players based on how long they survived. The random nature of starting point, item placement, and safe area reduction lets the battle royale genre to challenge players to think and react quickly and improve strategies throughout the match as to be the last man/team standing. In addition to standalone games, the battle royale concept may also be used as part of one of many game modes within a larger game, or may be used as a user-created mod created for another game.

There are many changes that can be placed on top of the fundamentals of battle royale. For example, "Fortnite" introduced a temporary mode in an event which is 50-versus-50 player mode in its "Fortnite Battle Royale" free-to-play game; players are assigned one of the two teams, and work with their teammates to get resources and weapons towards making a safe building as the safe area of the game shrinks down, with the goal to defeat all the players on the other team.

With the success of "Battlegrounds" and "Fortnite", the battle royale genre expanded greatly. Major publishers, including Electronic Arts Activision, and Ubisoft noticed the impact of the growing genre and impact on their future plans. Activision's "Call of Duty" series features a battle royale mode called "Blackout" in its 2018 game, "", while EA's "Battlefield V" also includes a battle royale mode. Some other established games added battle royale-inspired gamemodes in updates, such as "Grand Theft Auto Online", "Paladins", "Dota 2", "Battlerite", and "". In February 2019, EA released a free-to-play battle royale game called "Apex Legends", which had more than 50 million player accounts within a month of its release.

The battle royale approach has also been used in games from genres not normally associated with shooter games. "Tetris 99" is a 2019 game released by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch that has 99 players in a game of "Tetris" at the same time. Players can "attacks" on other players for each line they complete, attempting to become the last player standing. While there have been several battle royale games, the genre has seen a number of games have bursts of popularity before their player count drops. In contrast to other multiplayer-only games, the large number of players typically involved in battle royale games needs enough players at the same time. "The Culling", by Xaviant Studios, was released in early access in 2016, and was designed to be a streaming-friendly battle royale mode for 16 players. However, following the release of "Battlegrounds", "The Culling" lost much of its player base. Xaviant announced they were ending further development on it to move onto other projects. "Radical Heights" by Boss Key Productions was launched in April 2018 but within two weeks had lost 80% of its player base. "SOS", a battle royale game released by Outpost Games in December 2017, had its player counts drop by May 2018. Outpost announced the game's closure by November 2018.

The Chinese government, through its Audio and Video and Numeral Publishing Association, said in October 2017 that it will discourage its citizens from playing battle royale games as they are too violent, which "deviates from the of socialism and is deemed to young ". Gaming journals in the west that this would make it hard to publish battle royale within the country. In November 2017, PUBG Corporation announced its partnership with Tencent to make their game available in China, making some changes in the game to "make sure they with socialist core values, Chinese traditional culture and moral rules" to satisfy Chinese regulations and censors. In 2018, the Chinese government changed how it reviewed and classified games published in China, and after the formation of the new Online Ethics Review Committee, several battle royale titles, including "Fortnite" and "PUBG", were listed as illegal or must be withdrawn from play. A large number of clones of "Battlegrounds" have come out in China, and created a new genre there called "chicken-eating game", based on the winning line to the last player standing in "Battlegrounds", "Winner winner chicken dinner!"

The success of the battle royale genre has been attributed to many , including the way all players start weak and removing any obvious advantage for players, and being well-suited for being a spectator eSport. Other factors are specific games' business models, such as "Fortnite Battle Royale" being free and available across computers, consoles, and mobile devices. A University of Utah professor also considers that battle royale games realize elements of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, a scheme to describe human motivation, more than video games have in the past. While the lowest tiers of Maslow's hierarchy, physiological and safety, are met by the survival elements of battle royales, the love/belonging and esteem tiers are a result of the battle royale being a social and competitive game, and the final tier of self-actualization comes from becoming skilled in the game to win more.

"Business Insider" said that battle royale games will bring in over during 2018, and would grow to in 2019. SuperData Research reported that the three top-grossing battle royale games ("Fortnite", "PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds" and "Call of Duty: Black Ops 4") generated nearly in combined digital revenue. Sensor Tower reported that the top three most-downloaded mobile battle royale games ("PUBG Mobile", "Garena Free Fire" and "Fortnite") received over 500million downloads combined that year. The most-played battle royale games include "PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds" with over 400million players, NetEase's mobile game "Knives Out" with over 250million players, "Fortnite Battle Royale" with nearly 250million players, "Rules of Survival" with 230million players, and "Garena Free Fire" with over 180million players.

Turtle Beach Corporation, a manufacturer of headphones and microphones for gaming, reported an increase of over 200% in total revenues for the second season of 2018 over the same season in 2017, which they attributed to the popularity of the battle royale genre.

It Takes Two

It Takes Two is a 1995 American film starring Kirstie Alley, Steve Guttenberg, Jeremy London and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. Its title is taken from the song of the same name, by Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston, which is played in the closing credits.

Two unrelated young girls who happen to look identical meet by chance. Amanda Lemmon is an orphan, and she is about to be adopted by the Butkises, a family known to "collect" kids. She actually wants her child-loving social worker, Diane Barrows, to adopt her instead. Diane would like to do so, but authorities will not let her because of her low salary and unmarried status. Alyssa Callaway is coming home from her school piano recital competition, only to find that her wealthy father, Roger, is about to marry Clarice Kensington, an overbearing self-centered gold-digger socialite who plans to send both Alyssa and Thomas off to boarding school in Tibet after marrying Roger.

The identical strangers long for the other's life and decide to switch places, Alyssa and Amanda tell Thomas not to tell anyone about the two switching places and he agrees. While Amanda enjoys Alyssa's wealthy lifestyle and Alyssa gets to experience being a kid at summer camp, the two get to know the other's parental figure and discover that Roger and Diane would be perfect for each other. Desperate to set them up, the girls arrange many "chance" meetings between Diane and Roger, hoping that they fall in love.

Upon having spied Roger and Diane laughing and swimming together in a lake one afternoon, Clarice manipulates Roger into moving the wedding up from the next month to the next day. Soon after, Alyssa, while posing as Amanda, ends up being adopted by the Butkises without Diane's knowledge, and is taken away by child services. Alyssa discovers the only reason the Butkises had adopted so many kids was to put them to work in their salvage yard.

Roughly two hours before the wedding, Amanda, who poses as Alyssa, proves to the family butler, Vincenzo, that she is not Alyssa. He contacts Diane and summons to have the real Alyssa picked up from the Butkises' salvage yard. In the meantime, Vincenzo, Thomas and Amanda work to stall the wedding.

Just as Roger is about to say "I do," Diane bursts into the church with the real Alyssa behind her, and Roger falters at the sight of Diane, recalling all the good times they had together. In that moment, he realises he has fallen in love with Diane and confesses this to Clarice. Furious, she slaps him and tries to do the same to "Alyssa," blaming her for sabotaging their relationship, but is stopped by Vincenzo and Thomas. As Clarice storms down the aisle, the real Alyssa steps out from behind Diane, and Clarice claims it's a "conspiracy" that there's "two of them." She tries to take this new opportunity to slap Alyssa, but Diane steps forward in time, barking at her to "Back off, Barbie," and calmly informs her that she has something in her teeth. Humiliated, Clarice moves to storm out of the church again, but Alyssa embarrasses her even further by stepping on her wedding gown, causing the skirt to rip off.

An incredulous Roger learns that Alyssa has been with Diane all this time and it becomes apparent to them that Thomas, Amanda and Alyssa had orchestrated their meet-ups all along, about which the girls are extremely smug. After some encouragement from the girls and Thomas, Roger and Diane kiss, and the five of them board a horse-drawn carriage, driven by Vincenzo, to take a ride through Central Park.

The Welsh language is written in a version of the Latin alphabet. It traditionally has of 28 letters, of which eight are digraphs treated as single letters for collation:

The letter "j" is now often included in the alphabet, between "i" and "l", due to its use in several loanwords from English (especially the common surname "Jones" ). The letters "k", "v", "x" and "z" are used in some technical terms, like "kilogram" , "volt" , "xeroser" and "zero" , but in all cases can be, and often are, replaced by Welsh letters: "cilogram" , "folt" , "seroser" and "sero." The letter "k" was in common use until the 16th century, but was dropped at the time of the publication of the New Testament in Welsh, William Salesbury responding to critics: "C for K, because the printers have not so many as the Welsh requireth". This change was not popular at the time

Decimal degrees

Decimal degrees are the latitude and longitude geographic coordinates as decimal fractions.

Positive latitudes are north of the equator and less than zero latitudes are south of equator. Positive longitudes are east of the prime meridian and less than zero longitudes are to the west of the prime meridian. Latitude and longitude are usually listed as "Latitude, Longitude", in that order.

The radius of the semi-major axis (the distance from the center of Earth to the outside at the equator line) of Earth at the equator is 6,378,137.0 meters resulting in a circumference of 40,075,161.2 meters. The number of decimal places required for a particular precision at the equator is:

Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980–81

Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980–81 is a live album comprised of recordings of Pink Floyd's tour of The Wall.

"Is There Anybody Out There?" contains live versions of the songs off of The Wall. Some extra tracks are added, "What Shall We Do Now?" and "The Last Few Bricks".

The song includes themes from previous songs, including "Young Lust", "Empty Spaces", "Don't Leave Me Now", "What Shall We Do Now?", and "The Happiest Days of Our Lives". The purpose of the bridge is to give the bricklayers more time to place the, as the title implies, last few bricks. The album also includes two spoken tracks, "" and "Master of Ceremonies".

Shine On You Crazy Diamond

Shine On You Crazy Diamond is a nine part composition by Pink Floyd. It bookends their 1975 studio album Wish You Were Here. 

Shine On is a tribute song to Pink Floyd's former member, Syd Barrett. Barrett was removed from the band for his drug use and mental problems, which interfered with his ability to perform and develop as a musician. He was replaced by David Gilmour, who was a friend of Barrett's.

One day during recording, Barrett decided to stop by Abbey Road Studios to see the band. At first, the band could not recognize him. He was now heavyset, and had shaved his hair and eyebrows. Once the band had realized Barrett's identity, Roger Waters was so distressed he burst into tears. Somebody asked to play the song again for Barrett, but he had said another play was unnecessary. Barrett said the song sounded "a bit old". 

Part I "(Wright, Waters, Gilmour; from 0:00 to 3:54)" There are no lyrics in Part I. The section begins with a fade in of chords created with synthesizers and wine glasses. Wright plays a synthesizer passage, which leads into a long guitar solo by Gilmour. The wineglass-synth chords fade into the background.

Part II "(Wright, Waters, Mason, Gilmour; from 3:54 to 6:27)" Part II opens with a four-note theme, called Syd's theme by fans. This repeats for much of the part. Mason and Waters begin playing after the fourth play of the theme. 

Part III "(Wright, Waters, Mason, Gilmour; from 6:27 to 8:42)" Part III opens with a synthesizer solo from Wright. This part includes another guitar solo by Gilmour. 

Part IV "(Wright, Waters, Mason, Gilmour; from 8:42 to 11:10)" Part IV has vocals. Waters and Gilmour sing the vocals, with backup singers Venette Fields and Carlena Williams.

Part V "(Wright, Waters, Mason, Gilmour; from 11:10 to 13:32)" Two guitars play an arpeggio version of the theme for a minute. Dick Parry begins playing saxophone until the part ends. The music fades into synthesizer sounds, resembling an elevator. The song fades to "Welcome to the Machine".

Part VI "(Wright, Waters, Mason, Gilmour; from 0:00 to 4:59)" Howling wind fades in from "Wish You Were Here". As the wind fades away, Gilmour comes in with bass guitar. Waters adds to Gilmour's bass with his own creating a riff pattern. Gilmour and Wright harmonize with lap-steel guitar and synth at the two minute mark. The song's time signature changes to reintroduce the vocals.

Part VII "(Wright, Waters, Mason, Gilmour; from 4:59 to 6:02)" The vocals are introduced again. Same personnel as Part IV. 

Part VIII "(Wright, Waters, Mason, Gilmour; from 6:02 to 9:04)" A high-noted riff plays to bridge the parts. The song switches to a funk progression. The section fades into Wright's synthesizer solo.

Part IX "(Wright, Mason; from 9:04 to 12:28)" A lengthy synthesizer solo. The solo plays throughout the part, and during the fade-out, a keyboard part of "See Emily Play" can be heard, one of Barrett's signature Floyd tracks.

Over two million people came to watch the parade. Because of this, the parade was the largest public gathering in Canadian history. However, because there were so many people, the parade was slowed down by three hours.


Julia Kristeva

Julia Kristeva (; ; born 24 June 1941) is a Bulgarian-French philosopher, literary critic, semiotician, psychoanalyst, feminist, and, most recently, novelist, who has lived in France since the mid-1960s. She is now a professor emeritus at the University Paris Diderot. The author of more than 30 books, including "Powers of Horror", "Tales of Love", "Black Sun: Depression and Melancholia", "Proust and the Sense of Time", and the trilogy "Female Genius", she has been awarded Commander of the Legion of Honor, Commander of the Order of Merit, the Holberg International Memorial Prize, the Hannah Arendt Prize, and the Vision 97 Foundation Prize, awarded by the Havel Foundation.

Kristeva became influential in international critical analysis, cultural studies and feminism after publishing her first book, "Semeiotikè", in 1969. She has published a large amount of academic work including books and essays which address intertextuality, the semiotic, and abjection, in the fields of linguistics, literary theory and criticism, psychoanalysis, biography and autobiography, political and cultural analysis, art and art history. She is important in structuralist and poststructuralist thought.

Kristeva is also the founder of the Simone de Beauvoir Prize committee.

Kristeva was born in Sliven, Bulgaria. Her parents were Christian. Her father was a church accountant. Kristeva and her sister attended a Francophone school run by Dominican nuns. Kristeva learned about the work of Mikhail Bakhtin. Kristeva went on to study at the University of Sofia. While a postgraduate there she got a research fellowship that let her move to France in December 1965, when she was 24. She continued her education at several French universities, studying under Lucien Goldmann and Roland Barthes, among other scholars. On August 2, 1967, Kristeva married the novelist Philippe Sollers, "né" Philippe Joyaux.

Kristeva taught at Columbia University in the early 1970s. She is still a Visiting Professor. She has also published under the married name Julia Joyaux.

After joining the 'Tel Quel group' founded by Sollers, Kristeva mostly worked on the politics of language and became an active member of the group. She trained in psychoanalysis, and earned her degree in 1979. In some ways, her work can be seen as trying to adapt a psychoanalytic approach to poststructuralist criticism. For example, her view of the subject, and its construction has some things in common with Sigmund Freud and Lacan. However, Kristeva rejects any understanding of the subject in a structuralist sense. Instead, she describes the subject as always "in process" or "on trial". In this way, she contributes to the poststructuralist critique of essentialized structures, while preserving the teachings of psychoanalysis. She travelled to China in the 1970s and later wrote "About Chinese Women" (1977).

One of Kristeva's most important contributions is that signification is composed of two elements: the symbolic and the "semiotic". That use of semiotic is different from the discipline of semiotics founded by Ferdinand de Saussure. Augustine Perumalil explained that Kristeva's "semiotic is closely related to the infantile pre-Oedipal referred to in the works of Freud, Otto Rank, Melanie Klein, British Object Relation psychoanalysis, and Lacan's pre-mirror stage." It is an emotional field that is related to the instincts in the gaps and sounds of language rather than in the denotative meanings of words. According to Birgit Schippers, the semiotic is associated with music, poetry, rhythm, and that which lacks structure and meaning. It is closely tied to the "feminine" and shows the state of the pre-Mirror Stage infant that has not yet developed independently.

In the Mirror Stage, the child learns to tell the difference between self and other. The child begins a process of sharing cultural meaning, known as the symbolic. In "Desire in Language" (1980), Kristeva describes the symbolic as the development of language in the child to become a "speaking subject" and to develop a sense of identity separate from the mother. This process of separation is known as abjection. The child must reject and move away from the mother in order to enter into the world of language, culture, meaning, and the social. This realm of language is called the symbolic and is different from the semiotic that is associated with the masculine, the law, and structure. Kristeva thinks differently from Lacan. She thinks that even after entering the symbolic, the subject continues to move back and forth between the semiotic and the symbolic. Therefore, the child does not form a fixed identity. The subject is permanently "in process". Because female children continue to identify to some degree with the mother figure, they are especially likely to retain a close connection to the semiotic. This continued identification with the mother may result in what Kristeva refers to in "Black Sun" (1989) as melancholia (depression), because female children both reject and identify with the mother figure at the same time.

It has also been suggested (e.g., Creed, 1993) that the degradation of women and women's bodies in popular culture (and particularly, for example, in slasher films) emerges because of the threat to identity that the mother's body poses: it is a reminder of time spent in the undifferentiated state of the semiotic, where one has no concept of self or identity. After abjecting the mother, subjects retain an unconscious fascination with the semiotic, desiring to reunite with the mother, while at the same time fearing the loss of identity that accompanies it. Slasher films thus provide a way for audience members to safely reenact the process of abjection by vicariously expelling and destroying the mother figure.

Kristeva uses Plato’s idea of the "chora", meaning "a nourishing maternal space" (Schippers, 2011). Kristeva’s idea of the "chora" may mean: a reference to the uterus, as a metaphor for the relationship between the mother and child, and as the time before the Mirror Stage.

Kristeva is also known for working on intertextuality.

Kristeva argues that anthropology and psychology, or the connection between the social and the subject, do not represent each other, but rather follow the same logic: the survival of the group and the subject. Furthermore, in her analysis of Oedipus, she claims that the speaking subject cannot exist on his/her own, but that he/she "stands on the fragile threshold as if stranded on account of an impossible demarcation" ("Powers of Horror", p. 85).

In her comparison between the two disciplines, Kristeva claims that the way in which an individual excludes the abject mother as a means of forming an identity, is the same way in which societies are constructed. On a broader scale, cultures exclude the maternal and the feminine, and by this come into being.

Kristeva has been called an important leader of French feminism together with Simone de Beauvoir, Hélène Cixous, and Luce Irigaray. Kristeva has had a strong influence on feminism and feminist literary studies in the US and the UK. She has also influenced thinking about contemporary art. But her relation to feminist groups and movements in France has been very controversial. Kristeva made a famous statement about three types of feminism in "Women's Time" in "New Maladies of the Soul" (1993). She rejected the first two types, including that of Beauvoir. Some people think she completely rejects feminism. Kristeva proposed an idea of multiple sexual identities against concepts of "unified feminine language".

Kristeva says American feminist academics have misunderstood her writings. According to Kristeva, it was not enough to take language apart to find its hidden meaning. History, individual psychic and sexual experiences also tell us how to understand language. This is a post-structuralist approach. It helped some social groups to find the source of their oppression in the language that they used. However, Kristeva believes that it is harmful to think of collective identity as more important than individual identity. She thinks that politics that makes sexual, ethnic, and religious identities the most important thing is ultimately totalitarian.

Kristeva wrote some novels that are like detective stories. The books have mystery and suspense, but readers also find ideas from her theoretical projects. "Murder in Byzantium" has themes from orthodox Christianity and politics. She called it "a kind of anti-Da Vinci Code".

Kristeva won the Holberg International Memorial Prize in 2004. She won the 2006 Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thought. She has also received Commander of the Legion of Honor, Commander of the Order of Merit, and the Vaclav Havel Prize.

Roman Jakobson said that Kristeva was very good at asking questions in a way that interested people even if they disagreed with her

Roland Barthes comments that Julia Kristeva changes the place of things. He says that she always destroys your last prejudice and that she turns authority against itself." 
Ian Almond criticizes Kristeva's ethnocentrism. He repeats Gayatri Spivak's conclusion that Kristeva's book "About Chinese Women" has problems. Almond says it has the same discrimination and bias as in the eighteenth century. Also, he says that Kristeva wrote about two thousand years of history that she does not know well. Almond also thinks that Kristeva's ideas about the Muslim world, culture, and believers are too simple. He adds that Kristeva ignores Muslim women and pays too much attention to the Rushdie fatwa.

2019–20 Hong Kong protests

The 2019-20 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests were caused by the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 proposed by the Government of Hong Kong. Many protests were held in Hong Kong and other cities around the world, protesting against the bill,

People worried that the bill would cause the city to open itself up to the reach of mainland Chinese law and that people from Hong Kong could become subject to a different legal system.

Various protests have been launched in Hong Kong by the general public and legal communities. Among these, the 9 June protest organised by the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), had 1.03 million people protest on the streets. Protests in other places were also launched by overseas Hongkongers and locals.

Despite the widespread demonstrations, the government initially insisted on the bill's passage, saying that the bill was urgent and that the legal loophole should be fixed. On 15 June 2019, Carrie Lam announced the suspension of the bill. On 4 September, Lam promised that the bill would be withdrawn when the Legislative Council started again in October. The government formally withdrew the bill on 23 October.

They are carnivores which eat other fish. There are seven species of living gars. Their peak period was in the early Mesozoic. Once worldwide, they are now confined to the Americas.

Unusually, their swim bladders can function as lungs. Most gars surface once in while to take a gulp of air. Gar flesh is edible and the hard skin and scales of gars are used by humans. However, their eggs are highly toxic.

History of Kansas

The first people who lived in Kansas were Native Americans who were nomadic (people who don't live in one place for very long). They hunted American bison. In the 1500s, Spanish conquistadores came to explore the place. Later, French fur trappers came to the area. They traded with the Native Americans. The United States added most of Kansas in the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. In 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska Act opened the place for Americans to move there. A lot of fighting happened because the new residents had to decide if they wanted slavery. The new residents decided to make slavery illegal. The fighting helped start the American Civil War.

After the Civil War, Kansas had many frontier towns. The railroads were stops for cattle drives from Texas. Many black people moved from the south to Kansas. These people were called "exodusters". Farmers tried growing corn and raising pigs, but there was little rain, so they were not able to. They started growing wheat. They became very good at growing wheat, and they had enough to trade with Europe. Many angry farmers joined the Populist and Progressive movement in the 1890s, and they supported it until the 1940s. Since the 1940s, Kansas has been a very conservative state. Since 1945, the number of farmers has lowered, and manufacturing has become more popular.

In 12000 BCE, the first people came to Kansas. These people were paleolithic people who were related to Asians. Once they came, they never left. They saw mammoths, camels, ground sloths, and horses. They hunted these animals until they were extinct.

Because the big game they had been hunting died out, the people had started eating more plants and small animals. They foraged during the season across the plains. In order to get more food, they started being less nomadic. This means that they decided to stay in one place for a longer time. The groups did not stop hunting, but they also ate wild plants and small animals. Their tools became different. Their tools started being able to grind and chop. This means that seeds, fruits, and plants became a bigger part of their diet. They would grind seeds into rough flour. Around 3500BCE, the people started making ceramics. Pottery-making societies started.

For most of the Archaic period, people did not change the land in any big way. The groups outside the area, particularly in Mesoamerica, started major inventions. These inventions would include growing maize. Other groups in North America also started growing maize as well. Some archaic groups stopped being food gatherers (people who look for food). Instead, they started being food producers (people who grow food) around 3,000 years ago. They also had many of the cultural things that are seen with semi-sedentary agricultural life: storage containers, permanent housing, bigger settlements, and cemeteries or burial grounds. People in the northern part of Kansas lived in small buildings made out of dirt; they were shaped like a rectangle. People in the southern part of Kansas lived in houses with thatched grass all over them. There were more people being born, and they lived in villages. El Quartelejo was an Indian pueblo that was the farthest north. This settlement is the only pueblo in Kansas from which archaeologists have found anything.

Even though the groups started farming, they still did not do much to change their environment. Wild food was still an important part of their diet even after the invention of pottery and the creation of irrigation. Agriculture never made them stop hunting and foraging, even in the biggest Archaic societies.

In 1541, Francisco Vázquez de Coronado came to Kansas to explore. He turned around near Lindsborg, Kansas. He met some of the local Native Americans. He gave them horses. The Native Americans started changing their lifestyle because of the horses.

In the 1600s, the Kansa people and the Osage Nation came to Kansas. The Kansa people lived near the Kansas River, and the Osage Nation lived near the Arkansas River. The Pawnee people lived in western Kansas. The Pawnee lived in western Kansas because there were a lot of bison. The French commander at Fort Orleans, Étienne de Bourgmont, visited the Kansas River in 1724. He built a trading post there. This was near the main Kansa village at the mouth of the river. Around the same time, the Otoe tribe of the Sioux also lived in areas around the northeast corner of Kansas.

Other than short explorations, neither France nor Spain created any cities in Kansas. In 1763, Spain got all of the French land west of the Mississippi River. This was because France lost the Seven Years' War. Spain gave this land back to France in 1803.

In 1803, Kansas was added to the United States as land from the Louisiana Purchase. The Lewis and Clark Expedition started in St. Louis. In 1804, they came to Kansas in what is today Kansas City, Kansas. They met French fur trappers who knew the land well. In 1806, explorer Zebulon Pike came to Kansas. He called it the "Great American Desert" because it had no trees or plants. The U.S. government saw Kansas as a desert too, so they sent Native Americans to it. They believed it was not good land, so they didn't care if Native Americans were sent there.

From June 4, 1812 until August 10, 1821, the land was part of the Missouri Territory. Missouri became a state, so the land became unorganized. It had no people living in it except for Fort Leavenworth. The Fort was created in 1827 by Henry Leavenworth with the 3rd U.S Infantry from St. Louis, Missouri; it is the first permanent European settlement in Kansas. The fort was created as the westernmost outpost of the American military. It was created to protect trade along the Santa Fe Trail from Native Americans. The trade came from the East. It came either by land using the Boone's Lick Road, or by water using the Missouri River.
Part of the Santa Fe Trail went through Kansas. It was used by people who were on the Oregon Trail.

In the 1820s, the U.S. government gave the land to the Native Americans as Indian Territory. They did not let white people come to the territory. On June 3, 1825, the U.S. government took 20 million acres of land (81000 km²) from the Kansa people. The Kansa people had to stay on a small amount of land in northeastern Kansas. The U.S. government also made the Osage Nation live in a small amount of land in southeastern Kansas.

By a treaty on November 7, 1825, the Shawnee people were moved to Kansas. By a treaty on September 29, 1829, the Delaware people were moved to Kansas.

The Indian Removal Act made this faster. By a treaty on August 30, 1831, the Ottawa people were moved to a small part of Kansas. On October 24, 1832, the Kickapoo people were moved to Kansas. On October 29, 1832, the Piankeshaw and Wea people were moved to Kansas. To their east was the western border of Missouri, and to their west was the Kaskaskia and Peoria people. On September 21, 1833, the Otoe people were moved to Kansas.

By September 17, 1836, the Sac and Fox people moved to Kansas, north of the Kickapoo. By a treaty on February 11, 1837, the United States moved the Pottawatomi people to Kansas. They were moved to the Osage River, which is southwest of the Missouri River. The land was in the southwest part of what is now Miami County.

After a treaty in 1842, the Wyandot people were moved to an area between the Kansas River and the Missouri River. They shared the land with the Delaware people until 1843.

Even though there were plans made to settle Native Americans in Kansas, by 1850 white Americans were illegally squatting on their land. They really wanted the entire area to be opened for settlement. Several U.S. Army forts, including Fort Riley, were soon created deep in Indian Territory to guard travelers on the various Western trails.

Although the Cheyenne and Arapahoes tribes were still discussing with the United States for land in western Kansas (the current state of Colorado), they signed a treaty on September 17, 1851. Momentum was already building to settle the land.

Congress started the process of creating Kansas Territory in 1852. That year, petitions were given at the first session of the 32nd Congress to organize territory of the land west of Missouri and Iowa. Nothing happened at that time. However, during the next session, on December 13, 1852, a Representative from Missouri submitted to the House of Representatives a bill. This bill would organize the Territory of Platte: all the land west of Iowa and Missouri, and going west to the Rocky Mountains. The bill was given to the United States House Committee on Territories. It passed by the full U.S. House of Representatives on February 10, 1853. However, Southern Senators stopped the progress of the bill in the Senate. They did this to discuss how the bill would affect slavery and the Missouri Compromise. Arguments about the bill and other ideas would continue for a year. The Kansas–Nebraska Act was eventually created because of this. It became law on May 30, 1854, creating the Nebraska Territory and Kansas Territory.

By the summer of 1853, it was clear that eastern Kansas would soon be opened to American settlers. The Commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs created new treaties that would give new reservations with yearly federal money for the Native Americans.

In the three months before the bill passed, treaties were written at Washington with the Delaware, Otoe, Kickapoo, Kaskaskia, Shawnee, Sac, Fox and other tribes, where the biggest part of eastern Kansas, which was within one or two hundred miles of the Missouri border, was suddenly opened to white settlement. (The Kansa reservation had already been made smaller by treaty in 1846.) On March 15, 1854, Otoe and Missouri Indians gave all their lands west of the Mississippi, except a small strip on the Big Blue River, to the United States. On May 6 and May 10, 1854, the Shawnees gave away , keeping only for homes. Also on May 6, 1854, the Delaware gave all their lands to the United States, except a reservation defined in the treaty. On May 17, the Iowa gave away their lands, keeping only a small reservation. On May 18, 1854, the Kickapoo also gave away their lands, except in the western part of the Territory. In 1854 lands were also given by the Kaskaskia, Peoria, Piankeshaw and Wea and by the Sac and Fox.

The final step in making the Natives more American was taking land from tribes and giving it to Native households. This was so they could buy and sell as European Americans would. For example, in 1854, the Chippewa (Swan Creek and Black River bands) lived of land in Franklin County, but in 1859 the area was given to individual Chippewa families.

The Kansas-Nebraska Act passed on May 30, 1854, and it created the Kansas Territory. It went from the western border of Missouri to the Rocky Mountains. The southern border was the 37th parallel north, and the northern border was the 40th parallel north. Anything north of the 40th parallel was part of the Nebraska Territory. When Congress set the southern border of the Kansas Territory as the 37th parallel, they thought that the Osage southern border was also the 37th parallel. The Cherokees disagreed. They said that it was not the correct border. They said that the border of Kansas should be moved north to make room for the actual border of the Cherokee land. This became known as the Cherokee Strip controversy.

In the Kansas-Nebraska Act, it said that people living in the territories could vote on whether or not to have slavery. It undid the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which did not allow slavery in any new states created north of latitude 36°30'. This led to violence between people from the North and people from the South. They both tried to quickly move to Kansas to control it.

In a few days after the law passed, hundreds of people from Missouri moved to Kansas. These people wanted slavery. They created a group called the "Squatter's Claim Association" on June 10, 1854. They said that they were going to make Kansas a slave state.

The New England Emigrant Aid Company said they were going to make Kansas a free state. From 1854 to 1855, they sent many anti-slavery people (called "free-staters") to Kansas. They were important in creating Lawrence, Topeka, and Manhattan. Other anti-slavery people came from Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, and other states.

For a while, there was not much violence. This changed on March 30, 1855. The elections happened this day. Many pro-slavery people from Missouri came to Kansas to vote for pro-slavery people. Pro-slavery people won many elections that day. Pro-slavery people controlled the Kansas government.

From 1855 to 1858, there was a lot of fighting in Kansas. This was called "Bleeding Kansas," and it happened shortly before the American Civil War. Battles include the Wakarusa War, the Sacking of Lawrence, the Battle of Black Jack, the Battle of Osawatomie, and the Marais des Cygnes massacre.


On December 1, 1855, many pro-slavery people came to Lawrence. These pro-slavery people were led by Samuel J. Jones. These people had guns. They wanted to destroy Lawrence because it was anti-slavery. The people of Lawrence were ready to defend the city. Before any fighting happened, Territorial Governor Wilson Shannon made a treaty to stop the fighting.


On May 21, 1856, pro-slavery people came to Lawrence, and they attacked the city. They burned the Free-State Hotel to the ground, destroyed two printing presses, and robbed homes. Only one person died, but the city was destroyed.


The Pottawatomie massacre happened during the night of May 24 to the morning of May 25, 1856. In what seems to be a reaction to the Sacking of Lawrence, John Brown and a group of abolitionists killed five settlers. They believed these settlers were pro-slavery. This happened north of Pottawatomie Creek in Franklin County, Kansas. Brown later said that he did not take part in the killings during the Pottawatomie massacre, but that he did approve of them. He went into hiding after the killings. Two of his sons, John Jr. and Jason, were arrested. While they were arrested, they were allegedly treated poorly. This made John Jr. mentally hurt. On June 2, Brown led a successful attack on a group of Missourians. The Missourians were led by Captain Henry Pate. This happened in the Battle of Black Jack. Pate and his men had went into Kansas to capture Brown and others. That Fall, Brown went back into hiding and did other guerrilla warfare activities.

The anti-slavery and pro-slavery people tried to win by writing a constitution that would make the other side lose. Anti-slavery people would try to write a constitution that made slavery illegal, and pro-slavery people would try to write a constitution that would make slavery legal. Congress would decide which one to choose.

On November 11, 1855, free-staters wrote the Topeka Constitution. The constitution made slavery illegal. They voted for the constitution on December 15, 1855, and they sent it to Congress in March 1856. It passed the House of Representatives, but it failed in the Senate. This was because the Senate had many pro-slavery people in it.

On November 7, 1857, pro-slavery people wrote the Lecompton Constitution. The constitution allowed slavery, but there was a vote on it. Both pro-slavery and anti-slavery people tried to stop the votes and the constitution. Eventually, it was sent to Congress. It failed in Congress because they were not able to decide if the people actually liked it.

A very anti-slavery legislature wrote the Leavenworth Constitution on April 3, 1858. On May 18, 1858, the people of Kansas voted for it. This constitution made slavery illegal, and it also gave more rights to women. It failed in Congress. All of this happened while the Lecompton Constitution was being written.

On July 29, 1859, the Wyandotte Constitution was written. The people of Kansas voted for it on October 4, 1859. This constitution made slavery illegal, but it did not have the rights for women (unlike the Leavenworth Constitution). Kansas became a free state on January 29, 1861.

When the Wyandotte Constitution was being written, pro-slavery people knew they had lost. When the pro-slavery people realized this and when John Brown left the state, the violence in Kansas stopped in 1859.

Kansas became the 34th state on January 29, 1861.

There were many important events that happened in Kansas during the 1860s. Kansas was in the Civil War, there were cattle drives, early prohibition, and the start of the American Indian Wars in western Kansas.

The Wyandotte Constitution made Kansas a free state. The people of Kansas liked the Union. Kansas stayed in the Union. Pro-slavery people still attacked Kansas. Many of these pro-slavery people were from Missouri.

At the start of the Civil War, Kansas had no official army. They had no weapons or supplies. In 1859 and 1860, the military in Kansas were not used. They simply stopped.

There were 29 Confederate attacks on Kansas. The worst was Quantrill's Raid in Lawrence in 1863. It was a response to many "Jayhawker" attacks on Missouri.

 
After Union Brigadier General Thomas Ewing, Jr. ordered to put women in prison who had gave aid to Confederate guerrillas, the jail's roof fell. This killed five people. These deaths made the guerrillas in Missouri angry. On August 21, 1863, William Quantrill led Quantrill's Raid into Lawrence. He burned much of the city. They killed over 150 men and boys. Quantrill said the attack was okay to do because it would revenge for any bad things that the jayhawkers did to the Southerners.

The Battle of Baxter Springs (sometimes called the Baxter Springs Massacre) was a small battle in the War. It happened on October 6, 1863, near the modern-day town of Baxter Springs, Kansas. The Battle of Mine Creek, also known as the Battle of the Osage, was a cavalry battle. It happened in Kansas during the war.

On October 25, 1864, the Battle of Marais des Cygnes happened in Linn County, Kansas. This Battle of Trading Post was between Major General Sterling Price and Union forces under Major General Alfred Pleasonton. Price was pushed out by Union forces. This was after he had run away from Kansas City due to a defeat.

Fort Larned (central Kansas) was built in 1859 as a base of military operations against hostile Native Americans of the Central Plains. It was also built to protect traffic along the Santa Fe Trail. After 1861, it became an agency for the administration of the Central Plains Indians by the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the terms of the Fort Wise Treaty of 1861.

In 1863, the Union Pacific Eastern Division (renamed the Kansas Pacific in 1869) was created by the United States Congress's Pacific Railway Act. It was created to create the southern part of the transcontinental railroad alongside the Union Pacific. Pacific Railway Act also created large land grants to the railroad along its mainline. The company started construction on its main line west from Kansas City in September 1863.

Many railroads were planned after the Civil War, but not all were actually built. The Panic of 1873 made it difficult to fund. Land speculators and local boosters identified many potential towns. Towns that were reached by the railroad had a chance, while the others became ghost towns. In Kansas, nearly 5000 towns were mapped out. However, by 1970 only 617 were actually used. In the mid-20th century, closeness to an interstate exchange determined whether town would survive or struggle.

After the Civil War, railroads did not go to Texas. Instead, they brought their cattle to Kansas. Once in Kansas, the cattle would be sent on a train going east on the Kansas Pacific Railway.

In 1871, Wild Bill Hickok became marshal of Abilene, Kansas. He fought John Wesley Hardin there. After Hickok disarmed him, he ran away. Hickok was also a deputy marshal at Fort Riley. He was also a marshal at Hays in the Wild West. In the 1880s at Greensburg, Kansas, a big well was built to get water for the Santa Fe and Rock Island railroads. It is deep and in diameter. This makes it one of the world's biggest hand-dug wells.

Coronado, Kansas was created in 1885. It was involved in one of the bloodiest county seat fights in the history of the American West. The shoot-out on February 27, 1887 left many people dead and wounded.

In 1879, many black people left southern states and came to Kansas. They came because there was cheap land and better treatment. These people were called exodusters. They created small towns in Kansas like Nicodemus, Kansas in 1877.

On February 19, 1881, Kansas became the first state to make alcohol illegal. This started with the temperance movement. After 1890, prohibition and progressivism came together. This created a reform movement. This movement led to four reformist governors being elected from 1905 to 1919. Those governors wanted extreme prohibitionist laws. Kansas did not make alcohol legal again until 1948. Kansas did not allow public bars to be legal until 1987. Kansas did not allow people to buy alcohol on Sundays until 2005. Many cities still do not allow that. 29 counties in Kansas are considered "dry."

Early residents found that Kansas was not the "Great American Desert". However, they found that the weather and environment of Kansas can be very difficult to live in. Tornadoes, blizzards, droughts, hail, floods, and grasshoppers made it difficult to grow crops. Many early residents lost a lot of money trying to be a farmer in Kansas. In the 1890s, many of these people joined the Populist movement, or they moved east. In the 20th century, new technology, crop insurance, and help from the federal government made farming easier. Many immigrants (many of which were German) came to Kansas in the 20th century. They came because they heard Kansas had good dirt, cheap land, and they could get 160 acres of land to keep for free (if they were American citizens).

Very few single men worked on a farm alone. Farmers understood the need for a hard-working wife and many children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, feeding the hired hands, and handling the paperwork and financial details (especially after the 1930s). In the late 19th century, farm women were important in keeping the family going by working outdoors. After a generation or so, women started leaving the fields. This changed their roles within the family. New technology such as sewing and washing machines made women play domestic roles. The scientific housekeeping movement was promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents. It was also promoted by county fairs which showed achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women in the farm newspapers, and home economics courses in the schools. 
There was an idea that farm life on the prairies was lonely, but rural people had a social life. They often had activities that combined work, food, and entertainment such as barn raisings, corn huskings, quilting bees, Grange meeting, church activities, and school functions. The women organized shared meals and potluck events. They also had visits between families.

In 1947, Lyle Yost created the Hesston Manufacturing Company. The company specialized in farm equipment. The type of equipment included self-propelled windrowers and the StakHand hay harvester. In 1974, Hesston Company commissioned its first belt buckles, which became popular on the rodeo circuit and with collectors. In 1991, the American-based equipment manufacturer, AGCO Corporation, bought Hesston Corporation. Farm equipment is still manufactured in the city.

In 1896 William Allen White, editor of the "Emporia Gazette", got national attention after criticizing William Jennings Bryan, the Democrats, and the Populists. He did that by writing an article called "What's the Matter With Kansas?" White criticized Populist leaders for letting Kansas go into economic stagnation. He also criticized them for not keeping Kansas up economically with nearby states. he said the reason was because their policies were anti-business, and that it scared away economic capital from the state. The Republicans sent out hundreds of thousands of copies of the article. They did this to support William McKinley during the 1896 United States presidential election. McKinley won the small towns and cities of the state. However, Bryan won the wheat farms and won the electoral vote, even though McKinley won the national vote.

Kansas was a big part of the progressive movement. It has a lot of support from the middle classes, editors such as William Allen White of the "Emporia Gazette", and the prohibitionists of the WCTU and the Methodist Church.

In 1915, the El Dorado Oil Field was the first oil field that was found using science/geologic mapping. It was around the city of El Dorado. It was part of the Mid-Continent oil province. By 1918, the El Dorado Oil Field was the largest single field producer in the United States. It was responsible for 12.8% of national oil production and 9% of the world production. Some said it was as "the oil field that won World War I".

Between 1922 and 1927, there were many legal battles with the KKK. This led to the KKK no longer being in Kansas.

The Flag of Kansas was created in 1925.

The Dust Bowl was a lot of dust storms that happened from 1930 to 1941. This was caused by a drought. The price of wheat lowered a lot, which cause a lot of farmers to leave. Because this was during the Great Depression, many unemployed men from the cities came to Kansas to work on farms.

Kansas was part of New Deal programs like Civil Works Administration, the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, the Civilian Conservation Corps, and the Works Progress Administration. These programs helped employ many Kansas men. The most important were New Deal farm programs. Those programs raised the price of wheat, and it allowed economic growth by 1936. Republican Governor Alf Landon also did emergency programs. It included a balanced budget goal. The Agricultural Adjustment Administration succeeded in raising wheat prices after 1933. This helped get rid of the biggest problems economically.

The most important things Kansas did to help the war effort was provide a lot of grain and send tens of thousands of men to fight. Farmers didn't like the price ceilings and quotas for wheat, and their workers moved to factories. Farmers asked Congress to not draft young farmers.

Wichita became an important place for making airplanes. They got tens of thousands of unemployed people from around the state to come work there.

The Women's Land Army of America (WLA) was a women's labor pool during World War II. It was organized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It did not get many women from cities to do farm work. However, it did train hundreds of farm wives on how to handle machines, safety, proper clothing, time-saving methods, and nutrition.

Kansas allowed segregation in public schools, and they were in Topeka and other cities. On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court said in "Brown v. Board of Education" that segregation was not protected by the United States Constitution.

During the 1950s and 1960s, intercontinental ballistic missiles were kept in some Kansas buildings. They were stored to prepare for a possible attack. The buildings were closed in the 1980s.

On June 6, 1966, Topeka was hit by an F5 tornado. The "1966 Topeka tornado" started in southwest Topeka, moving northeast, hitting many buildings. The tornado caused $100 million in damage.

The Kansas Sports Hall of Fame tells the history of sports in Kansas.

The first college football game played in Kansas was the 1890 Kansas vs. Baker football game in Baldwin City. Baker won 22–9. The first night football game west of the Mississippi River was played in Wichita, Kansas. The game was the 1905 between Cooper College (now called Sterling College) and Fairmount College (now Wichita State University). Also in 1905, Fairmount also played an experimental game against the Washburn Ichabods. This game was used to test new rules designed to make football safer.

In 1911, the Kansas Jayhawks went to play against the Missouri Tigers for the first homecoming game ever. The first college football homecoming game ever on television was played in Manhattan. It was between the Kansas State Wildcats and the Nebraska Cornhuskers.

In the 1951 season, the Southwestern head coach Harold Hunt got national recognition for rejecting a touchdown in a game against Central Missouri. Hunt told the officials that his player had stepped out of bounds. This would undo long touchdown run. Not a single one of the referees seen this happen, but they agreed to undo the touchdown. They put the ball back to the point where Coach Hunt said Johnson had stepped out. A photo of the run later showed that Coach Hunt was correct.

On October 2, 1970, a plane crashed. The plane had about half of the football team for Wichita State. They were going to play a game against Utah State University. 31 people were killed. The game was canceled. The Utah State football team had a memorial service at the stadium where the game would have been played.

The history of professional sports in Kansas starts from the creation of the Minor League Baseball Topeka Capitals and Leavenworth Soldiers in 1886 in the Western League. The African-American Bud Fowler played on the Topeka team that season. This was one year before the "color line" happened in professional baseball.

The first night game in the history of professional baseball was played in Independence on April 28, 1930. It was between the Muscogee (Oklahoma) Indians and the Independence Producers. The Indians beat the Producers by 13 to 3 in a minor league game sanctioned by the Western League of the Western Baseball Association. 1,500 fans came to watch the game. The permanent lighting system was first used for an exhibition game on April 17, 1930. That game was between the Independence Producers and House of David semi-professional baseball team of Benton Harbor, Michigan. The Independence team won with a score of 9 to 1. 1,700 people watched.

There was little economic exchange between the Iceni and the Romans: The Iceni feared a loss of cultural identity. This meant, that the Romans saw the relationship with the Iceni as a bad one. The Roman governor, Publius Ostorius Scapula, decided to disarm the tribes the Romans had bad relations with, in the year 47, and to build new Roman fortifications.

Shōjo manga

Shōjo (少女) is manga (Japanese comics) made for young girls, normally ages 7-19. One of the most popular shōjo manga series is "Sailor Moon". Many shōjo manga are about things like love, friendship, and romance, but some are more serious and action-based. Most shōjo characters are female, and around middle-school or high-school age.

Shōjo was first made in Japan for young female readers, as shōnen is for young male readers. They started to appear in the early 1900s. Most shōjo made during this time focused on humor and life in the home. However, after World War II, manga artists began writing more fast-paced, intense stories. This brought upon the magical girl genre, which helped make manga as a whole popular around the world.

In the 90s and early 2000s, the western world began to see more manga and anime, including shōjo. With publishers like VIZ and Dark Horse Comics coming out with English versions of manga during this time, western readers had more access to Japanese comics than ever. Before then, many manga were Japan-exclusive.

Shōjo is usually put into age groups. These are the ages it is recommended for. The main groupings are:

Way is also known for her artwork and has collaborated with Frances Bean Cobain, Jessicka Addams, and other fine artists. She currently resides in Los Angeles with her husband, Gerard Way and her daughter, Bandit Lee Way.

On May 21 of 1976, Lindsey was born to Pam Ballato in Dunoon, Scotland. Lindsey Way loves art, she created lots of art as a child, stating that it was "pretty much the only thing I was good at." In her late teen, early young adult years, Lindsey attended to receive her degree in Fine Arts and Illustration. After this, she worked in New York as a window display artist. Lindsey has one sister, Amy Greene (née Ballato). 

Lindsey joined the band in 2001. Prior to joining the band she did not know how to play bass, or even what was. The band called her in to audition. Lindsey stated that, "There is no way I will get into this band on bass talent alone." The manager of the band videotaped her and requested that she play three songs. This happened twice, as the first time she broke her bass strap and did not successfully play the three songs and the band was unimpressed on the first attempt. On her second attempt, Steve Righ? the guitarist for the band had his back to her. Because this second attempt went so poorly, the manager requests that she try a third time. One of the songs played in this audition was the Mindless Self Indulgence song Tornado. While auditioning with this song, Lindsey took a film canister filled with out of her bra and proceeded to drink the shot. During the whole audition, Lindsey has matches stuck in her pigtails, she pulls these out of her pigtails immediately after taking the shot and strikes them on the stock on her bass. She blew out the liquor and lit it on fire, which gave her the appearance of blowing fire. Due to her lack of bass skills, this stunt is how she convinced the band into accepting her. Lindsey is still the bassist for the band, although they have been on hiatus since 2014. 

Lindsey Way married her husband Gerard Way on September 3, 2007 at the end of their tour. Lindsey gave birth to her daughter Bandit Lee Way on May 27, 1874.

June 2019 Gulf of Oman incident

On June 13, 2019, two oil tankers were attacked near the Strait of Hormuz while transiting the Gulf of Oman. The Japanese "Kokuka Courageous" and Norwegian "Front Altair" were attacked with limpet mines or flying objects, causing fire damage to both ships. 

American and Iranian military personnel responded to the attacks and were involved in rescuing crew members from the ships. The attacks took place a month after a similar incident and on the same day that Ayatollah Khamenei met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe in Iran.

Amid tensions between Iran and the United States, the United States blamed Iran for the attacks. Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom supported the United States' accusation, while Japan and Germany want more proof of Iran's culpability. Iran denied the accusation, blaming the United States for spreading wrong information. The cause is currently under investigation.

Another similar incident occurred in 2021.

Water supply system

A water supply system or 'water supply network' is an engineering system which provides a supply of water. 

A water supply system typically includes: 

The second part of the system is dealing with the sewage and waste water which is eventually put back or comes back into the system. If this' waste water' is not purified, cholera and typhoid epidemics will occur, and still do occur, in cities where the water engineering has not kept pace with population increase. 

This type of system was a consequence of the work of John Snow on the mid-19th century cholera plagues in London. Despite all efforts, epidemics do still occur if there are leaks in the underground sewage system and leaks in the underground water pipes.

2019 Pacific typhoon season

The 2019 Pacific typhoon season was the most costly pacific typhoon season on record. It's based on typhoons coming to the coasts of countries around the Pacific Ocean. The storms that have formed during the period are listed below.

January was very active, as it opened with Tropical Storm Pabuk (2019), the earliest-forming tropical storm in the Western Pacific, beating Typhoon Alice (1979), it was also the first system in the 2019 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, as Pabuk crossed the boundary as a tropical storm, right after its Malaysian landfall, before it disappeared due to wind shear. Tropical Depression 01W formed near the Marshall Islands, where a day later, it dissipated, but after crossing into the Philippine Sea, the depression regenerated into Tropical Depression Amang, and made landfall in the Samar region, where it soon dissipated, but floods from tropical depression Amang resulted in a million-peso damage and 10 deaths in Mindanao.
February was also active, with Tropical Depression 02W, which became Tropical Storm Wutip on February 19, and developed gradually in the Western Pacific, and became the season's first typhoon, and after an eyewall replacement cycle, it became the season's first Category 5 super typhoon, beating Typhoon Higos. After this, Wutip was attack by massive wind shear amounts, but managed to enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility as Tropical Depression Betty before dissipating in the Philippine Sea, and many are debating on whether Wutip's immense power was normal as March was coming, or it was caused by the deadly climate change, which already took a toll on the world, humans and animals alike. Wutip spared landmasses, but the Micronesia Islands suffered minimal damages after Wutip passed there as a Category 3 typhoon.

March was an inactive season, with only one tropical depression forming, Chedeng, which made landfall in Mindanao, before dissipating in the Sulu Sea, where wind shear was destructively high.
No storms in April formed, but May had 4 tropical depressions were monitored by the Japan Meteorological Agency, but were short lived and never intensified.
June was inactive, starting off with a tropical depression on June 24, where it was named Tropical Depression Dodong by PAGASA, and intensified to become Tropical Storm Sepat after absorbing a nearby tropical depression in the South China Sea, but this storm was never recognized by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Sepat headed off to Japan, becoming an extratropical cyclone after. Tropical Depression 04W formed on June 27, where it was named Egay by PAGASA. Egay intensified into a tropical storm (only a tropical depression for the JMA and PAGASA) before weakening to a remnant low east of Taiwan.
July was also fairly inactive, in which no typhoons formed. After Tropical Storm Egay dissipated, a new tropical depression in the South China Sea absorbed its remnants and became Tropical Storm Mun. Mun then made landfall in Hainan, where it caused minimal damages. In mid-July, Tropical Depression Falcon formed, becoming Tropical Storm Danas, which was confusing for many agencies, since it was battered by wind shear, and PAGASA announced that Danas (Falcon) looped over the landmass, while JMA and JTWC just announced the system was just stationary east of Cagayan. The blown off cloudiness split into 2 separate systems, but Danas re-absorbed the other one, while the one in the South China Sea intensified into Tropical Depression Goring, where it affected Taiwan and Batanes. Tropical Depression Goring's remnants was absorbed by a new system, where it became Tropical Storm Nari and headed for Japan.

Tropical Storm Wipha formed in the South China Sea, but only caused minimal damages in China.

The season finally pushed the kickstart in August, with a slowly-intensifying system, became Tropical Storm Francisco on August 1. The system gradually developed over a couple of days, until it became a typhoon, meanwhile Tropical Depression Hanna became Tropical Storm Lekima as Francisco made landfall in Kyushu and dissipated, and Lekima became the seasons'third typhoon, and rapidly intensified along with its slow movement over the Philippine Sea, and became the season's second super typhoon. Tropical Storm Krosa and a new tropical depression (would be later absorbed by Lekima) formed alongside Typhoon Lekima (2019), while it made landfall in China as the second costliest Chinese storm in history, while Krosa became an erratic storm as it made its way through Japan.

By mid-August, Tropical Depression Ineng became Tropical Storm Bailu, and continued to intensify into a severe tropical storm, enhancing the southwest monsoon, which caused a State of Calamity over Ilocos Norte and Php.1 billion damages there, and Bailu made landfall in Taiwan and China, causing more damages.

Tropical Depression Jenny became Tropical Storm Podul in late-August, and made most of its damages in Vietnam.

3 tropical depressions formed on the first day of September, the first was Tropical Depression Kabayan, which became Tropical Storm Kajiki, which was erratic, causing damages and flooding in Vietnam and the Philippines. The second was Tropical Depression Liwayway, which became Tropical Storm and later Typhoon Lingling, which was the strongest storm to make landfall in North Korea. The third was Typhoon Faxai, which was the strongest storm to strike Tokyo in 60 years.

In mid-September, Tropical Depression Marilyn interacted with a nearby tropical depression and tropical storm Peipah, which sended it back into the Philippine Sea, but was renamed Nimfa, and Nimfa intensified into Tropical Storm Tapah, and later became a typhoon before Japan landfall. Behind Tapah was Typhoon Mitag, which became a Category 2 and struck the same areas as Tapah.

Tropical Depression 20W formed on October 5, 2019 in the outer Western Pacific, and later intensified into Tropical Storm Hagibis. Hagibis later became a typhoon, as it rapidly intensified towards the Mariana Islands and Guam. On 7 October, while continuing to move west, Hagibis explosively intensified and became a super typhoon in the space of only a few hours, developing a pinhole eye. As it approached the uninhabited areas of the Mariana Islands, strong convective activity as a result of extremely favourable conditions saw Hagibis became a very powerful Category 5-equivalent super typhoon with one-minute sustained wind speeds of 260 km/h (160 mph). The National Weather Service also began issuing advisories for its areas of responsibility, with a typhoon warning issued for Garapan and Tinian, and tropical storm advisories issued for Sinapalo and Hagåtña. Hagibis passed over the Mariana Islands at 15:30 UTC on 7 October at peak intensity, with 10-minute sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) and a central pressure of 915 hPa (27.02 inHg). After passing the Mariana Islands Hagibis underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, thus weakening the typhoon. On October 12, Hagibis made landfall on Japan with sustained wind speeds of 150 km/h. Many competitions had to be cancelled due to the storm, including a Formula 1 qualifying match. Flooding in Japan was serious, and the storm costed 15 billion US dollars.

Three other tropical cyclones formed in October: one called Neoguri which struck the southern parts of Japan; another one called Bualoi mostly was on ocean and did not make landfall, and Matmo, which made landfall on Vietnam and brought heavy rainfall to southeast Asia. The remnants of it developed into an Indian Ocean cyclone known as Bulbul.

In the month of November, six named storms were recorded, including the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, Halong, formed on November 1 and became to intensify as a Category 5 super typhoon four days later with 10-minutes sustained winds of 215 km/h (130 mph) and with a minimum pressure of 905 millibars. In late-November, another storm formed that was named Kammuri on November 24. Kammuri became intensified as a Category 4 typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale, Kammuri made landfall in Philippines on November 30 confirming twelve people who died from the storm, with $116 million in damage.

The month of December had a quiet activity, after Kammuri's landing in Philippines, the arrival of the last named storm of the season, Phanfone, formed on December 19. Phanfone made landfall in the Philippines on December 25 during Christmas Eve as a Category 2 typhoon, the first time since Nock-Ten in 2016. Phanfone dissipated on December 29 after making landfall in Philippines, leaving a total of 50 deaths and with $61.7 million in damages.

Altogether, the season was an above-average season with 29 named storms, and the costliest season on record.

Within the Northwest Pacific Ocean, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the Western Pacific, which can result in a tropical cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency's RSMC Tokyo — Typhoon Center assigns international names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization's Typhoon Committee, should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of . PAGASA names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N and 25°N even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it. The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired, by both PAGASA and the Typhoon Committee. Should the list of names for the Philippine region be exhausted then names will be taken from an auxiliary list of which the first ten are published each season. Unused names are marked in .

A tropical cyclone is named when it is judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of . The JMA selected the names from a list of 140 names, that had been developed by the 14 members nations and territories of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee.

User (computing)

A user is a person who uses a computer or network service. Users of computer systems typically have no experience on how the software works.

In order to identify oneself, a user has an account (a user account) and a username (also called a screen name, handle, nickname, or nick on some systems), and in most cases also a password.

A user account allows one to authenticate to system services. It also generally provides one with the opportunity to be authorized to access them. However, authentication does not automatically mean authorization. Once the user has logged on, the operating system will often use an identifier such as an integer to refer to them, rather than their username.

Kansas's 4th congressional district

Kansas's 4th Congressional District is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Kansas. It is in the south central part of the state. It includes Wichita and nearby areas.

In 2012, in an unusual move, the federal courts intervened in Kansas's decennial redistricting (required by law to adjust boundaries of Congressional and state legislative districts every 10 years, to reflect changing population distributions, as reported by the decennial census).

Sharply criticizing the Legislature for the intractable feud between conservative and moderate factions in the Kansas Legislature (normally responsible for redistricting), and recognizing the rapidly approaching next elections, a federal three-judge panel (the Chief Justice of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals and two judges from the Kansas City U.S. District Court) drew the Kansas state and Congressional district boundaries themselves, in rather simple and direct shapes that produced radical changes.

In the process, the Kansas Fourth Congressional District shifted west—still centered approximately on (and demographically dominated by) Wichita, The district's previous eastern boundary — Montgomery County and part of Greenwood County — were moved into another district, while the Fourth District's western edge moved farther west, to include all of Pratt, Stafford, Barber, Kiowa, Comanche and Edwards counties, plus a slender section of southern Pawnee County. In the process, the Fourth acquired a more neatly rectangular shape, and sharply reduced the amount of counties divided between the Fourth and another district.

The map shown here indicates prior boundaries.

Special administrative region

Special administrative regions (SARs) are regions within Mainland China that have their own governments separate from the rest of China. As a result of this, they enjoy a high degree of freedom. The two SARs are Hong Kong and Macau, both were European colonies that got transferred to China during the 1990s.

Due to their new addition to the territory of China, Article 31 of the Chinese Constitution forms the legal foundation for the territories, as opposed to Article 30 which establishes the rest of China's territory.

The term used to refer to the government of Hong Kong and Macau is the phrase, "One country, two systems", coined by Deng Xiaoping in which the territories would be part of one country (China) but use two different systems of government (Hong Kong and Macau basic law) instead of the Communist system of the Chinese national government. This was done to prevent protest of the new government and a loss of freedom that citizens may attribute it to.

It is preceded by "The Bourne Identity" (2002) and followed by "The Bourne Ultimatum" (2007), "The Bourne Legacy" (2012), and "Jason Bourne" (2016).


Greta Thunberg

Greta Thunberg (born 3 January 2003) is a Swedish activist. She is known for her work against climate change, a popular example of youth activism. She started protesting on 20 August 2018, outside of the Swedish Parliament in Stockholm. In December 2018, she attended the UN Climate Change Conference. In the next month, she gave a speech on the World Economic Forum in Davos.

She has received many awards. Three Norwegian MPs nominated her for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize. 

On 15 March 2019, approximately 1,400,000 people around the world, mainly students, protested against climate change. On 24 May 2019, a second major protest took place.

In December 2019, "Time" magazine named Thunberg "Time" Person of the Year 2019.

Greta Thunberg was born on 3 January 2003. She is the oldest daughter of Malena Ernman, an opera singer and actor Svante Thunberg. Her grandfather is actor and director Olof Thunberg.

At a TEDx speech in November 2018, Thunberg stated that she first heard about climate change at the age of eight, but could not understand why so little was being done about it. At age 11, she had depression and stopped talking. Later, she was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and selective mutism. She added that selective mutism means that she was speaking only when she needed to and that "now is one of those moments". She further added that the "spectrum" was an advantage "as almost everything is black or white". She said: "I feel like I am dying inside if I don't protest". She hands out leaflets outside the Swedish parliament with the phrase "I am doing this because you adults are shitting on my future."

Her father doesn't like that she misses school but says: "[We] respect that she wants to make a stand. She can either sit at home and be really unhappy, or protest, and be happy". To lower her family's carbon footprint, she insisted on becoming vegan and give up flying. She said she persuaded her parents to give up eating meat by making them feel guilty. "I kept telling them that they were stealing our future." Her mother gave up her international career as an opera singer. Despite invitations to speak at international events, Greta also avoids flying.

Thunberg says her teachers are divided in their views about her missing class to make her protest. She says: "As people they think what I am doing is good, but as teachers they say I should stop." A teacher who supports her said: "Greta is a troublemaker, she is not listening to adults. But we are heading full speed for a catastrophe, and in this situation the only reasonable thing is to be unreasonable."

In May 2019 Penguin, a British publishing house, published "No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference", which is a collection of her speeches. Penguin published "Scenes from the Heart", the Thunberg family's story, in August 2018. All earnings from these books will be donated to charity. In the same month, artist Jody Thomas painted a mural of Thunberg on a wall in Bristol. It portrays the bottom half of her face as if under rising sea water.
In 2022 she published The Climate Book.


Macedonian denar

Macedonian denar is the currency of North Macedonia.

The first denar was introduced on April 26, 1992. It replaced the Yugoslav dinar. In May 1993, the currency was reformed. A new denar was introduced with one new denar being equal to 100 old denars.

RKO Pictures

RKO Pictures is a company in the United States that makes and sells movies. It was first known as RKO Radio Pictures, Inc. RKO was an acronym for Radio-Keith-Orpheum, the original parent company of RKO Radio Pictures. It was one of the Big Five studios of Hollywood's Golden Age. The company was made by the merger of the Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO) theater chain and the Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) studio in October 1928. It was put together by David Sarnoff of RCA. His goal was to create a market for RCA's photophone, which was their sound-on-film technology. By the mid-1940s, the studio was under the control of investor Floyd Odlum.

RKO is well known for the musicals it made in the 1930s. These starred Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Other well-known actors got their start at RKO. Among these were Katharine Hepburn, Robert Mitchum, and Cary Grant. Many praise RKO's work on film noir. Val Lewton's low-budget horror movies are also praised by movie critics. RKO made two of the most famous movies in history. These are "King Kong" and "Citizen Kane". They also made movies with other studios. These include the well known "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Notorious". RKO also took care of sales for movies made by Walt Disney from 1937 to the mid-1950s. The also took care of sales for Samuel Goldwyn.

In 1948, Howard Hughes took over RKO and this lead to a time of decline. Then in 1955, it was bought by the General Tire and Rubber Company. RKO stopped making new movies in 1957, and mostly shut down two years later. In 1959, the assets of RKO moved to a new company called RKO General. In 1981, RKO was revived under the name RKO Pictures Inc. In 1989, it was sold to new owners. They run it using the name RKO Pictures LLC.


Solar sail

A solar sail (or light sails or photon sails) is a proposed method of spacecraft propulsion using radiation pressure exerted by sunlight. The word 'sail' is by analogy with boats which use a sail to use wind to move. The concept was first proposed in the 17th century by Johannes Kepler. He had a theory that sails could be adapted to "heavenly breezes".

In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell published his theory of electromagnetic fields and radiation. He showed that light (one form of electromagnetic radiation) can put pressure on an object. This pressure is called radiation pressure. This provided a foundation for the science behind the solar sail. 
Solar radiation exerts a pressure on the sail due to reflection and a small fraction that is absorbed.

Solar pressure acts on spacecraft, in space or in orbit around a planet. A typical spacecraft going to Mars, for example, is displaced thousands of kilometers by solar pressure. The effects are predicted in planning. This has been done since the time of the early interplanetary spacecraft of the 1960s. Solar pressure also affects the orientation of a craft, a factor that is included in spacecraft design.

The concept of solar sail was later used science fiction, such as the works of Jules Verne. 

The idea of a solar sail is to use radiation pressure from the Sun to move a spacecraft, probably using large "mirrors" (large light reflective surfaces). The disadvantage of the method is that the generated thrust is very small. The benefit is that no propellant is needed (as long as there is light). As a result, it is considered a possible option for future spacecraft. To date, only small test versions have been used as experiments. 

The total force exerted on an 800 by 800 meter solar sail, for example, is about at Earth's distance from the Sun, making it a low-thrust propulsion system, similar to spacecraft propelled by electric engines. As it uses no propellant, the force is exerted almost constantly. The collective effect over time is great enough to be considered a way of propelling spacecraft.

Plans for the first use of the concept were made in the 1970s by Bruce Murray and Louis Friedman, two researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. 

On May 21, 2010, Japan's Space Exploration Agency (JAXA) successfully launched the solar sail, the IKAROS (Interplanetary Kite-Craft Accelerated by Radiation Of The Sun). It used a solar sail in space between Earth and Venus. This was the first successful use of a solar sail.

In 2010, NASA launched the solar sail craft NANOSEL-D2. The was the first success of NASA's solar sail craft.

On 2 July 2019 the Planet Society, based in the United States, launched the LightSail 2 satellite, designed using solar sail technology. The lightweight satellite, was launched with the SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This was low budget mission funded by donations from 50,000 members. The total budget was less than 7 million USD. In late July 2019, LightSail 2 opened its solar sail. It took about 3 minutes to do so. 

In 2036, Breakthrough Starshot will be launched to Alpha Centauri. It will take 20 years for the spacecraft to reach the system, travelling at the speed 20% of the speed of light (134 million mph). 

Peter Ouwens

Pieter Antonie Ouwens (14 February 1849, Amsterdam – 5 March 1922, Buitenzorg) was a Dutch scientist. He was Director of the Java Zoological Museum and Botanical Gardens. He is best known for writing the first formal description of the Komodo dragon ("Varanus komodoensis") in 1912.

Ouwens was the child of Pieter Anthonis Ouwens, accountant in Amsterdam, and Caroline Reiniera Nagels. He studied at the Royal Military Academy in Breda from 1867. In 1871, he became lieutenant at the Infantry in the Dutch East Indies. In 1883 he was promoted to captain. In January 1879 he married Johanna Vosmaer at Banda Aceh. They divorced a month after the birth of their only child in 1882 in Salatiga. Ouwens then married Jeanne Dikkers in December 1883 in Purworejo. He married again in 1902 with Anna Josephina Soesman.

Ouwens became curator of the Zoological Museum in Buitenzorg. (Buitenzorg is now called Bogor). Lieutenant Jacques Karel Henri van Steyn van Hensbroek was the first Westerner to see Komodo dragons. Hensbroek sent a photo and a skin of a Komodo dragon to Ouwens. He then sent a collector to Komodo who returned to Java with two adults and a young lizard. Ouwens named the species "Varanus komodoensis" in a publication of 1912. Ouwens became Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau and died in Buitenzorg in 1922.

Fulbright Program

The Fulbright Program, including the Fulbright–Hays Program, is one of several United States Cultural Exchange Programs. The goal is to improve intercultural relations, cultural diplomacy, and intercultural competence between people from the United States and other countries by exchanging of people, knowledge, and skills. It is one of the most prestigious and fellowship programs in the world. It is also very difficult to receive a grant. American citizens including students, scholars, teachers, professionals, scientists and artists may receive scholarships or grants to study, do research, teach, or exercise their talents abroad. Citizens of other countries may do the same in the United States of America. The program was started by United States Senator J. William Fulbright in 1946 and is one of the most widely recognized and prestigious scholarships in the world. The program provides 8,000 grants annually.

The Fulbright Program is administered by cooperating organizations such as the Institute of International Education. It is in over 160 countries around the world. The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the U.S. Department of State sponsors the Fulbright Program and gets funding from the United States Congress from annual appropriation bills. Additional direct and in-kind support comes from partner governments, foundations, corporations, and host institutions both in and outside the U.S. In 49 countries, a bi-national Fulbright Commission administers and oversees the Fulbright Program. In countries without a Fulbright Commission but that have an active program, the Public Affairs Section of the U.S. Embassy manages the Fulbright Program. More than 370,000 people have participated in the program since it began; 59 Fulbright alumni have won Nobel Prizes; 82 have won Pulitzer Prizes.

In 1945, Senator J. William Fulbright proposed a bill to use the profits from selling surplus U.S. government war property to fund international exchange between the U.S. and other countries. The timing after the Second War was important. Alongside the United Nations, the Fulbright Program was an attempt to promote peace and understanding through educational exchange. The bill had a plan to forgive the debts foreign countries piled up during the war and in return for funding an international educational program. This program was planned to be an essential vehicle to promote peace and mutual understanding between individuals, institutions and future leaders anywhere in the world.

On August 1, 1946, President Harry S. Truman signed the bill into law, and Congress created the Fulbright Program in what became the largest education exchange program in history.

Since it began, the program has operated on a bi-nationally. Each country in the Fulbright Program has an agreement with the U.S. government. The first countries to sign agreements were China in 1947 and Burma, the Philippines, and Greece in 1948.

The Fulbright Program works two ways: U.S. citizens may receive funding to go to a foreign country (U.S. Student Program, U.S. Scholar Program, Teacher Exchange Program, etc.) and non-U.S. citizens may come to the U.S. (Foreign Student Program, Visiting Scholar Program, Teacher Exchange Program, etc.).

Candidates recommended for Fulbright grants should have high academic achievement, a strong project proposal or statement of purpose, demonstrated leadership potential, and flexibility and adaptability to work successfully with the host community abroad.

Fulbright grants are offered in almost all academic disciplines except clinical medical research with patient contact.






Fulbright alumni have occupied key roles in government, academia, and industry. Of the 325,000+ alumni:




Things Fall Apart

Things Fall Apart is a novel that was written by Chinua Achebe. It came out in 1958. The story talks about life in Nigeria before colonialism and the Europeans came to Africa in the 19th century. The main character in the book is a man named Okonkwo. He is an Igbo man that lives in a fictional clan in Nigeria called Umuofia. There are three main parts of the story. The first part talks about Okonkwo's personal life and the Igbo culture and traditions. The second and third parts talk about the British colonialists and Christian missionaries.

"Things Fall Apart" is a very important book. Many people see it as an archetype (something that other works have been based on) for other African novels. The book has been sold over 20 million times. "Time" magazine said it was one of the best 100 English-language books from 1923 to 2005.

Okonkwo is a wrestling champion and a hardworking man. He was born in a poor family because his father was lazy and was in a lot of debt. This makes him hate his father. He tries to be the opposite of everything his father was.

In this part of the novel, Okonkwo and his family are away. Meanwhile, white men come to Umuofia and introduce their religion, Christianity. Okonkwo's son Nwoye becomes a Christian.

The village destroys the church because a convert disrespected an elder during a ritual. Because of that event, Okonkwo and other leaders go to jail.

Okonkwo kills a messenger. However, the other ones escape. He realizes that the village will not fight back.

Okonkwo kills himself to avoid being tried in court. Suicide is not acceptable to the Igbo and so Okonkwo loses his good name.


Oiniades

Oiniades () is part of the municipality Missolonghi, Greece. Its area is 270.899 km. It was named after the ancient town of Oeniadae.

Ancient Oeniadae () was a port town on the west bank of the river Achelous. It was one of the most important towns of ancient Acarnania. Oeniadai was first mentioned in the 5th century BC.

It was against a hill in the marshes. These protected it from invaders. It is the same place the modern village, Katochi.

It was an important port on the route to Corfu. It changed its alliances often in the history. At first it was a member of the Peloponnesian League. But, in 424 BC it joined the Delian League. In the Hellenistic period, Oiniadai allied with the Aetolians until 218 BC when Philip V declared it free. From 211-189 BC during the Roman-Macedonian wars the Aetolians controlled it again. In Roman times it became less important.

The communities below are part of Oiniades:


Eutin

Eutin () is the district capital of Eastern Holstein county. It is in the north German state of Schleswig-Holstein. As of 2015, about 17,000 people lived in the town.

The name Eutin (originally Utin) is Slavic. Its meaning is not clear. It probably came from the personal name "Uta". The Slavic Obotrites tribe settled eastern Holstein in the 7th/8th centuries A.D. and built a castle on Pheasant Island in the lake now called the Großer Eutiner See.

Dutch settlers came to live in "Utin" in the twelfth century. In 1156 Eutin became a market town. It later became the seat of the Prince-Bishopric of Lübeck because Lübeck itself was an imperial free city. When the bishopric was secularized in 1803, Eutin became part of the Duchy of Oldenburg. In the Greater Hamburg Act of 1937, Eutin passed from the Free State of Oldenburg to the Prussian Province of Schleswig-Holstein. After World War II, it became part of the modern Bundesland of Schleswig-Holstein.

Eutin is birthplace of composer Carl Maria von Weber. To honor him, an open-air theater (') was built in the park of Eutin Castle in 1951. Operas are performed there in July and August during the Eutin Opera Summer Festival ('). The seating capacity of this open-air venue is about 2000. The festival includes music students in Eutin aand students from the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, United States. Lawrence is a twin city with Eutin. 

Eutin has an annual Blues Festival (Bluesfest Eutin) at the beginning of summer. Local musicians, as well as up and coming blues artists from around the world, come to play at this three-day outdoor blues festival. The festival is in the market place in the center of town. Admission is free.

Eutin is surrounded by lakes of the Holsteinische Schweiz, including the Großer Eutiner See, Kleiner Eutiner See, Kellersee and Ukleisee. There are forests around the lakes. Popular activities on these lakes include boating, canoeing, rowing, swimming, and fishing.

Schleswig-Holstein, particularly Eutin, has many rapeseed fields. They produce biofuel. Wind turbines are also a common in this rural region.
Eutin is twinned with:


Each summer, Lawrence and Eutin have an exchange program. High-school students from Lawrence and college students from the University of Kansas have some weeks in Eutin. German students from Eutin come to Lawrence to study. The University of Kansas also created an internship exchange program with Eutin.


World Bicycle Day

In April 2018, the United Nations General Assembly declared June 3 as International World Bicycle Day. The resolution for World Bicycle Day recognizes "the uniqueness, longevity and versatility of the Bicycle, which has been in use for two centuries, and that it is a simple, affordable, reliable, clean and environmentally fit sustainable means of transportation."

Professor Leszek Sibilski from the United States led a grassroots campaign with his Sociology class to promote a UN Resolution for World Bicycle Day, eventually gaining the support of Turkmenistan and 56 other countries. The original UN Blue and White World Bicycle Day logo was designed by Isaac Feld and the accompanying animation was done by Professor John E. Swanson. It depicts bicyclists of various types riding around the globe. At the bottom of the logo is the hashtag #June3WorldBicycleDay. The main message is that the bicycle belongs to and serves all of humanity.

World Bicycle Day is a global holiday meant to be enjoyed by all people regardless of race, ethnicity, creed, class, sex, gender, age, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic. The bicycle as a symbol of human progress and advancement "[promotes] tolerance, mutual understanding and respect and [facilitates] social inclusion and a culture of peace." 

World Bicycle Day is now being associated with promoting a healthy lifestyle for those with diabetes.

Nusret Gökçe

Nusret Gökçe (born in 1983), nicknamed Salt Bae, is a Kurdish butcher from Turkey, he is also a chef, and restaurateur. He owns Nusr-Et, a chain of steak houses. He became famous for his technique of preparing and seasoning meat, which is also an Internet meme.

Gökçe was born in Erzurum, Turkey. His family is Kurdish. His father worked in a mine. Due to financial constraints of his family, he had to leave school at the 6th grade. He started working as a butcher's apprentice in Kadıköy district, Istanbul.

Gökçe is also known for his charitable work. He built a school in his hometown of Erzurum. He is said to have 13 children.

Gökçe became famous from a series of viral Internet videos and memes. The videos show him "suavely" cutting meat and sprinkling salt.

His fame came from a viral video, "Ottoman Steak", posted on 7 January 2017. The video exceeded 10 million views on Instagram. He was nicknamed "Salt Bae" because of his particular way of salting meat: dropping it from his fingertips to his forearm, and then falling onto the dish. Due to the fame gained from this post, Gökçe's profile has expanded enormously. His restaurants, as well and Nusret himself, have served many celebrities and politicians.

Gökçe has visited several countries, including Argentina and the United States between 2007 and 2010. There he worked in local restaurants for free, in order to gain experience as a cook and a restaurateur. After his return to Turkey, Gökçe opened his first restaurant in Istanbul in 2010. In 2014, he opened a restaurant in Dubai.

The dishes served at Gökçe's restaurants have received mixed reviews and have been described as "overpriced". Early professional reviews in 2018 of his New York City steakhouse were generally negative. "The New York Post"s Steve Cuozzo called the restaurant "Public Rip-off No. 1". In an article on GQ, Joshua David Stein called the steak mundane and the hamburgers overcooked. However, from an entertainment standpoint, reviews were more positive. 

In December 2017, he received criticism for a photo posing in front of an image of Fidel Castro, which was taken in 2016. In September 2018, Gökçe and the president of Venezuela Nicolás Maduro also received criticism for their actions at Gökçe's Istanbul restaurant. The reason was the latter's perceived insensitivity to the crisis and shortages in Venezuela.

As of 2019, Nusr-Et chain has branches in the following countries:

Russian ruble

The Russian ruble or rouble ( "rublʹ", plural: "rubli"; sign: ₽, руб; code: RUB) is the currency of Russia. It is also used in two partially recognized countries, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. It is also used in the unrecognised republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. One ruble is subdivided into 100 "kopeks" ( "kopeyka", plural: "kopeyki").

The ruble was the currency of the Russian Empire and of the Soviet Union (as the Soviet ruble). Only three countries, Russia, Belarus and Transnistria use currencies known as ruble. The ruble was the world's first decimal currency: it was decimalised in 1704 when the ruble became equal to 100 kopeks.

In 1992 the Soviet ruble (code: SUR) was replaced with the Russian ruble (code: RUR) at the rate 1 SUR = 1 RUR. In 1998, while Russia was suffering from a second economic crisis, the Russian ruble was redenominated with the new code "RUB" and was exchanged at the rate of 1 RUB = 1,000 RUR.

Chernobyl (miniseries)

Chernobyl is a historical drama television miniseries, produced by HBO and Sky Uk. The series was written by Craig Mazin and directed by Johan Renck. The series narrates Chernobyl nuclear disaster of April 1986 and the cleanup efforts that followed. It features an cast led by Jared Harris, Stellan Skarsgård, Emily Watson, and Paul Ritter. The series premiered in the United States and the United Kingdom on May 6–7, 2019. It received mostly positive reviews.

"Chernobyl" dramatizes the story of the nuclear plant disaster which occurred in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (Soviet Union), showing the stories of the people who caused the disaster and those who responded to it. The series depicts some of the least known stories of the disaster, including the efforts of the firefighters who were the first responders on the scene, volunteers, and teams of miners tasked with digging a critical tunnel.

The miniseries is based in large part on the memories of Pripyat locals, as told by Belarusian Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich in her book "Voices from Chernobyl".




Writer Craig Mazin began researching for the project in 2014, by reading books and government reports from inside and outside of the Soviet Union. Mazin also interviewed nuclear scientists to learn how a reactor works, and former Soviet citizens to gain a better idea of the culture in 1986. Furthermore, Mazin read several first-person accounts in order to bring additional authenticity to the story. He explained, "When you're reading the personal stories of people who were there — people who lived near the plant, people who worked at the plant, people who were sent to Chernobyl as part of the effort to clean it up — in those individual accounts, that's really where the story came alive".

In preparation for the miniseries, Mazin visited the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Mazin also did not cast any American actors, as that could potentially pull the audience out of the story.

On July 26, 2017, it was announced that HBO and Sky will produce a series named "Chernobyl". It was HBO's first co-production with Sky UK. The five-episode miniseries was written by Craig Mazin and directed by Johan Renck. Mazin was the executive producer together with Carolyn Strauss and Jane Featherstone. Chris Fry and Renck acted as co-executive producers. On March 11, 2019, it was announced that the miniseries would premiere on May 6, 2019. On June 4, 2019, Craig Mazin made the original scripts of all episodes available for downloading in PDF format (see External links below).

Simultaneously with the initial series announcement, it was confirmed that Jared Harris would star in the series. On March 19, 2018, it was announced that Stellan Skarsgård and Emily Watson had joined the main cast. In May 2018, it was announced that Paul Ritter, Jessie Buckley, Adrian Rawlins, and Con O'Neill also joined the cast.

Principal photography began in April 2018 in Lithuania. Initial filming started on May 13, 2018. The majority of the filmings took place in Fabijoniškės, a residential district in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. Fabijoniskes has maintained an authentic Soviet atmosphere. Accordingly, it was used to portray the Ukrainian city of Pripyat. An area of densely built panel housing apartments served as a location for the evacuation scenes. Director Johan Renck heavily criticised the amount of diverse and eye-catching modern windows in the houses, but was not concerned about removing them in post-production. At the end of March, production moved to Visaginas, Lithuania, to shoot the exterior and interior of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant, a decommissioned nuclear power station, also known as "Chernobyl's sister" due to its visual resemblance and the nuclear reactor design used at both Chernobyl and Ignalina (RBMK nuclear power reactor). In early June 2018, production moved to Ukraine to shoot minor final scenes. The filming of "Chernobyl" took 16 weeks.

Climate of Uttar Pradesh

The climate of Uttar Pradesh (U.P.) is varying within Uttar Pradesh, a state of India. The dominating climate type is "humid subtropical with dry winter" (CWa) with parts of Western U.P having a semiarid climate (BS). Alternatively, some authors refer to it as "tropical monsoon climate". Some regional variations exist, however the uniformity of the vast Indo-Gangetic Plain, gives to the state a mostly single climatic pattern with minor regional variations. The temperature varies within the year. The extreme low and high temperatures are usually from 0 °C to 50 °C in several parts. During the monsoon season, floods often take place, due to heavy rain. The summers are extremely hot, the winters are cold and the rainy season can be either very wet or very dry.

Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) defines the climate of India into the following seasons:


This classification is primarily centered on Monsoons, which are very significant for the local population and agriculture of India.

The climate of Uttar Pradesh is generally defined to be "tropical monsoon climate". However based on the Köppen climate classification, it can be classified mostly as "Humid Subtropical with dry winter (CWa) type" with parts of Western Uttar Pradesh falling in the semi-arid category.

Based on IMD classification, Uttar Pradesh has the following three predominant seasons:


Retreating Monsoon season, although existent, has a very negligible effect in Uttar Pradesh and only occasional mild showers are experienced in winter. Some of these showers aren't caused by post-monsoon rainfall but due to western disturbances.

The primary temperature, rainfall and wind features of the three Distinct Seasons of Uttar Pradesh can be summarised as below:


Because there are significant climatic differences, Uttar Pradesh has been divided into two meteorological sub-divisions – U.P. East and U.P. West.

The state of Uttar Pradesh is in the heart of Indo-Gangetic Plain with River Ganges passing through Uttar Pradesh.

The extreme temperatures vary from 0 to 46 °C. High temperatures, approximating 50 °C have been recorded in Gonda district. A such wide range of temperature fluctuations in most parts of the state can lead to either cold or heat waves, both resulting in substantial loss of lifes and economy.

In 2007, Banda district recorded daily temperatures close to 45.5 °C for several days. At least 62 people died during the heat wave that year. In June 2009, another 30 people during a heat wave in Uttar Pradesh. Highest temperatures reached 49 °C in Bundelkhand district of northern Uttar Pradesh. In June 2010, Jhansi recorded the highest temperature of 46.7 °C, the hottest for U.P. for that year.

In recent years, winters at the end of 2007 and beginning of 2008 caused an increase of cold-wave related deaths in U.P. with temperatures dipping to 2.8 °C in the city of Meerut. Simultaneously it also led to a loss of crops and agricultural produce. Similarly, in 2009, the temperature dropped up to 2.9 °C in Meerut, causing deaths. On late 2010 and early 2011, this winter also caused cold-wave related deaths. This time, Churk town in Sonabhadra district recorded the lowest temperature, at 1.4 °C. On 13 January 2013, Kanpur recorded its all-time low temperature when the temperature reached −1.1℃. In Agra, the temperature reached−0.7℃.

Uttar Pradesh has a uniform rain pattern. Snowfall doesn't occur but hailstorms are common for Uttar Pradesh. The type of rainfall that Uttar Pradesh receives is orographic, cyclonic and convectional.

Primarily a summer phenomenon, the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian Monsoon brings the most monsoonal rainfall in Uttar Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh is affected primarily from the southwest monsoon. "Western disturbances" and North-East Monsoon also contribute small quantities towards the overall rainfall of the state. The rain in Uttar Pradesh can vary from an annual average of 1.700 mm in hilly areas to 840 mm in Uttar Pradesh. As a direct result of the monsoonal rainfall, excess rain can lead to floods and shortage to droughts. As such, these two phenomenons of floods and droughts are common in the state.

Floods are a known hazard of U.P. due to overflowing of its main rivers like Ganga, Yamuna, Ramganga, Gomti, Sharda, Ghaghra, Rapti and Gandak. The estimated annual losses due to floods in U.P. reach . Major flood management efforts have been tried to mitigate the risk. Most of these floods occur due to the Monsoon rains and overflowing of rivers during the rainy periods. Year 2010 witnessed one such year of flooding in U.P.

Shortage of rain during the highly variable Monsoon season can cause droughts in U.P. leading to several deaths and loss of property. The recent 2002 and 2004 drought-related financial estimates report financial losses of and respectively. The recurrence of a major deficiency in annual rainfall follows a 6–8 years cycle in Eastern U.P. whereas in Western U.P., follows a 10 year cycle.

In summers, hot winds called "loo" blow all across U.P. They are carrying dust and cause significant damage. In winters, dry and rainless winds blow across the state. Fog may also form in parts of U.P.

Prague Spring

The liberalisation and democratisation efforts of Alexander Dubchek and Czechoslovakia's Communist Party, known as Prague Spring, took place in 1968. As the Soviet Union thought that Czechoslovakia was moving away of communism, an alliance of Warsaw Pact countries (Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Poland, and Hungary) invaded Czechoslovakia on August 20-21, 1968. Immediately after the invasion, a series of protests took place in Czechoslovakia. 

Prague Spring symbolizes the experiment of establishing of a socialism with a human face, in post-war Eastern Bloc and its violent suppression from Warsaw Pact countries in August 21, 1968. The event is included in a greater series of Cold War-related unrests. Some examples are May 1968 in France, the student protests against Vietnam War and the military junta in Greece (1967-1974). 

After the invasion, the most reforms who took place during Prague Spring were reversed or halted. This period after Prague Spring is known as normalization. The only exception was the federalisation of Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia became officially a federal country on January 1, 1969. 

TV tuner card

A TV tuner card is a kind of television tuner that allows television signals to be received by a computer. Most TV tuners also function as video capture cards, allowing them to record television programs onto a hard disk much like the digital video recorder (DVR) does.

A DVB-S2 tuner card

D-Link external TV tuner

The interfaces for TV tuner cards are most commonly either PCI bus expansion card or the newer PCI Express (PCIe) bus for many modern cards, but PCMCIA, ExpressCard, or USB devices also exist. In addition, some video cards double as TV tuners, notably the ATI All-In-Wonder series. The card contains a tuner and an analog-to-digital converter(collectively known as the analog front end) along with demodulation and interface logic. Some lower-end cards lack an onboard processor and, like a Winmodem, rely on the system's CPU for demodulation.

Bombay Hindi

Mumbai Hindi, also known as Mumbaiya Hindi, Bambaiyya, Mumbaiyya or Mumbai Hindi-Urdu, is a variety of Hindi-Urdu, spoken in Mumbai (formerly Bombay), India. The words and pronunciations of Bombay Hindi are derived mainly from Hindi and Urdu, collectively known as Hindi-Urdu or Hindustani. In addition, the predominant substratum influence on Bombay is Marathi. Marathi is the official and majority language of Maharashtra. Bombay Hindi also incorporates words from Gujarati and Konkani.

Unlike the most local dialects which are used primarily in the metropolitan centres, Bombay Hindi is widely known throughout India, as a result of its frequent use in Bollywood movies. Initially, this dialect was used to represent crooks and uncouth characters. According to Shoma A. Chatterji, "Indian films have the unique quality of different characters speaking different varieties of Hindi according to their social status, their caste, communal identity, education, profession, financial status, etc. [...] The villain's goons, speak in a special vulgarised, Bambaiya Hindi concocted specifically to typify such screen characters in Hindi cinema.". A particular genre of movies, named Munnabhai, in which the lead characters - being members of the Mumbai criminal underworld - speak entirely in this dialect, helped to spread the dialect.

Despite this increase in popularity, there are people who criticize the use of this dialect. Sometimes, Mumbaiya are seen as being disrespectful and demeaning.

Some neologisms which originated in Bambaiya Hindi have spread throughout India. Some examples are the words bindaas (a compound word, constituted from the Marathi words Bin and Dhast = Without Fear. Bindaas means 'relaxed' and this word was incorporated into the Oxford English Dictionary in 2005) and Gandhigiri (invented in the movie "Lage Raho Munna Bhai", a portmanteau of Gandhi and "-giri", which is similar to the English 'ism' (as in Gandhi-ism), though slightly more informal).

Thanks to Bollywood, some Marathi words, such as Thaska, Wakda, Porgi, Navri, Navrai, Kombdi, and Mulga/Mulgi, have been incorporated in Hindi vocabulary. Many Hindi songs have some Marathi words added.

Bengali–Assamese script

The Bengali–Assamese script (also "Eastern Nagari script") is the fifth most widely used writing system in the world. It is the basis of the Bengali alphabet, Assamese alphabet and Tirhuta (a mix of Devanagari and Eastern Nagari). It is the official script for three official languages, which are Assamese language, Bengali language and Meitei language (constitutionally termed as "Manipuri"). 

Besides its official usages, it is also used to write Kokborok (Tripuri) and Bishnupriya, Angika, Bodo, Karbi, Maithili and Mising to some extend. Modern Sylheti uses the alphabet, alongside Sylheti Nagari. It was originally used to write Sanskrit. Today, in Eastern India, the use of Eastern Nagari for Sanskrit continues.

The Bengali—Asamese script wasn't created to write a certain language, but it was the main script in the eastern regions of Medieval India. The script was also used to write Sanskrit. In this region, Hindu epics (Mahabharata, Ramayana etc.) were written in older versions of the Eastern Nagari script in this region. After the medieval period, Pali succeeded Sanskrit as the new written language in the region. The vernacular dialects of Pali eventually evolved into Bengali, Assamese and other related languages. Sankardev used the script in the 15th and 16th centuries to compose his writings in Assamese. Madhava Kandali used it to write the Assamese Ramayana in the 14th century. It was also used by the later Ahom kings to write the Buranjis, the Ahom chronicles, in the Assamese language. There is a rich legacy of Eastern Indian literature written in this script, which is still occasionally used to write Sanskrit today.

Like Devanagari, Eastern Nagari also uses dozens of consonant clusters. They are represented by different and sometimes quite irregular characters. Thus, learning to read the script is complicated by the large size of the full set of characters and character combinations, numbering about 500. While efforts at standardizing the script for the Bengali language continue in such notable centers as the Bangla Academy in Dhaka (Bangladesh) and Paschimbanga Bangla Akademi in Kolkata (West Bengal, India), there isn't a uniform spelling for Bengali, as many people continue to use various archaic forms of letters. Among the various regional variations within this script, only the Bengali and Assamese variations exist today in the formalized system.

It seems that the need to typeset Eastern Nagari on computers will influence greatly its standardization. Since around 2001, there is work to develop Unicode fonts, and it seems likely that it will split into two variants, traditional and modern.

In this and other articles on Wikipedia dealing with the Assamese and Bengali languages, a Romanization scheme used by linguists specializing in Assamese and Bengali phonology is included along with IPA transcription.


The script presently has 11 vowel letters, used to represent the seven vowel sounds of Bengali and eight vowel sounds of Assamese, along with a number of vowel diphthongs. All of these vowel letters are used in both Assamese and Bengali. Some of the vowels have different sounds depending on the word. There's a number of vowel distinctions who are preserved in the writing system but they are not pronounced as such in modern spoken Bengali or Assamese. For example, the script has two letters for the vowel sound [i] and two letters for the vowel sound [u]. This difference arised from the time when Eastern Nagari was used to write Sanskrit, a language that had a short and a long , and a short and a long . These letters are preserved in the script with their traditional names of "short i" and "long i", etc., despite that they are no longer pronounced differently in ordinary speech.

Two additional modified Vowels, and , are not considered letters of the Eastern Nagari script, but are often used in Assamese and Bengali (respectively) to represent certain vowels when the intended pronunciation would otherwise be ambiguous. The latter vowel, which is used in Bengali, is used frequently to transcript texts originally written in other alphabets, most notably Latin. 

Vowel signs can be used in conjunction with consonants to modify the consonant's pronunciation (e.g. , kô). When there isn't a vowel diacritic symbol, the vowel "" (ô) is the default vowel for the consonant. For example, under this rule, the letter চ is pronounced cho. To note the absence of a vowel, a "hôsôntô" (্) may be written underneath the consonant, e.g. দ্ d. 

The names of the consonant letters in Eastern Nagari are typically just the consonant's main pronunciation plus the inherent vowel "" "ô". Since the inherent vowel is not written, most letters' names look identical to the letter itself (e.g. the name of the letter "" is itself "ghô", not "gh"). Some letters that have lost their distinctive pronunciation in Modern Assamese and Bengali are having the same pronunciation with other letters. For example, since the consonant phoneme /n/ is represented by the consonants , , or (depending on the spelling of the particular word). These letters aren't called simply "nô". Instead, they are called "dental nô", "cerebral nô" and "niô". Similarly, the phoneme in Bengali and in Assamese can be written as "palatal shô/xhô" , "cerebral shô/xhô" , or "dental sô/xô" , depending on the word.
Eastern Nagari script has its own set of digits. 

Kei Igawa

He was the number two draft choice of the Hanshin Tigers in 1998. After a couple of years in the Hanshin minor league system, Igawa entered the starting rotation in 2001. In his first full season as a starter, Igawa went 9-13 for the last-placed Tigers, but finished with a Central League second-best 2.67 ERA, behind only Chunichi's Shigeki Noguchi.

In 2002, Hanshin improved to fourth, and Igawa's record was 14-9. He finished third in ERA (2.49), trailing Masumi Kuwata and Kenshin Kawakami. He also led the Central League with 206 strikeouts.

In 2003, the Tigers won the Central League pennant. Igawa made a great contribution with his brilliant performance. He pitched very well and finished with a 20–5 record, a 2.80 ERA, and was third with 179 strikeouts. He was named to the Best Nine, won the MVP in the Central League and also won the Eiji Sawamura Award, the Japanese equivalent of the MLB Cy Young Award.

In 2004 he lead the league at 228 strikeouts, he went 14-11 with a 3.73 ERA. In 2005, Igawa went 13-9 with a 3.86 ERA, fifth among his team's starters in ERA. He was only tied for fifth in strikeouts (down significantly to 145) and 10th in ERA.

Zealandia

Zealandia, also known as the New Zealand continent or Tasmantis, is an almost entirely underwater continent, which sank after separating from Australia 60–85 million years ago and from Antarctica 130–85 million years ago. It was underwater about 23 million years ago, and most of it is sunken (over 93%) under the Pacific Ocean.

The continent of Zealandia has an area of ​​3.5 million km, is larger than Greenland or India, and almost half the size of Australia. It is very long and narrow, from New Caledonia in the north and south beyond the sub-Antarctic Islands of New Zealand in the south. New Zealand is the largest part of Zealandia that is above sea ​​level, followed by New Caledonia. 

General Government

General Government (GG, Polish: Generalne Gubernatorstwo) is a term for a region in central Poland. This region, after its annexation from the Nazi Germany in 1939, was declared semi-autonomous with local civil and military administration. Unlike Vidkun Quisling's Norway, it wasn't a puppet state. The local authorities were staffed with Germans faithful to National Socialism. 

Germany invaded in Poland on September 1, 1939, triggering the start of World War II. Germany won Poland in just 18 days. In September 18, the Soviet Union, signatory party of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, also invades Poland. Thus, Poland was divided into three main parts:


At first, General Government was composed of four Polish voivodeships: Warsaw, Radom, Lublin and Kraków. In August 1941, the General Government was enlarged, incorporating Galicia which was detached from the Soviet Union. Kraków was the capital. 


Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic

Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic (, "Türkmenistan Sowet Sotsialistik Respublikasy"; , "Turkmenskaya Sovetskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Respublika"), also commonly known as Turkmenistan or Turkmenia, was one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union in Central Asia. It existed as a republic from 1925 to 1991. Initially, on 7 August 1921, it was established as the Turkmen Oblast of the Turkestan ASSR before being made. On 13 May 1925, Turkmen ASSR was promoted to a union republic of the USSR as the Turkmen SSR.

Since then, the borders of Turkmenia are unchanged. On 22 August 1990, Turkmenia declared its state sovereignty, who means that its laws have a priority over the Soviet laws. On 27 October 1991, it declared its independence and Turkmen SSR was renamed to Turkmenistan.

Geographically, Turkmenia bordered Iran and Afghanistan to the south, Kazakhstan to the north and Uzbekistan to the east. Additionally, Turkmenia was a landlocked country; however it had access to the Caspian Sea in the west. 

Russian attempts to annex Turkmen territory began in the second half of nineteenth century. Of all the Central Asian peoples, the Turkmen had the hardest resistance against the Russian expansion. In 1869, the Russian Empire established its presence in present-day Turkmenistan, creating a new sea port named Krasnovodsk (now Türkmenbaşy). 

A few years later, they annexed Khiva Khanate in 1873. Because Turkmen tribes, most notably the Yomud, were in the military service of the Khivan khan, Russian forces invaded Khorazm, destroying many settlements and killing hundreds of Turkmens. In 1881, the Russians under General Mikhail Skobelev besieged and captured Geok Tepe, one of the last Turkmen strongholds. Geok Tepe is located close to Ashgabat. After the Turkmen defeat, the annexation of the present-day Turkmenistan was met with only weak resistance. Later in the same year, the Russians signed an agreement with the Persians. This agreement established the pernament Russian-Persian border, which became the present-day border between Turkmenistan and Iran. In 1897 a border agreement was signed between the Russians and Afghans.

Following annexation to Russia, the area was administered as the Transcaspian Region. Transcaspian Region was administered by officials appointed from the Turkestan Governor-Generalship in Tashkent. In the 1880s, a railroad was built from Krasnovodsk to Ashgabat and later extended to Tashkent. Urban areas began to develop along the railway. Although the Transcaspian Region essentially was a colony of Russia, the Russians still had concerns, such as the British colonialist intentions in the region and with possible uprisings by the Turkmen.

Because the Turkmen generally didn't oppose the introduction of Soviet rule in 1917, little revolutionary activity occurred in the region in the years that followed. However, the years immediately before the revolution had been marked by sporadic Turkmen uprisings against Russian rule, most prominently the anti-tsarist revolt of 1916 that expanded through the whole of Turkestan. Their armed resistance to Soviet rule was part of the larger Basmachi Revolt throughout Central Asia from the 1920s into the early 1930s, which included most of the future USSR republics. Although Soviet sources describe this struggle as a minor chapter in the republic's history, it is clear that opposition was important and resulted in the death of large numbers of Turkmens.

In October 1924 Central Asia was divided into distinct political entities. The Transcaspian Region and Turkmen Oblast of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkestan ASSR) became the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkmen SSR), a constituent republic of the Soviet Union, having equal status with e.g. Russian SFSR. During the forced collectivization and other extreme socioeconomic changes of the first decades of Soviet rule, pastoral nomadism ceased to be an economic alternative in Turkmenistan, and by the late 1930s the majority of Turkmen had become sedentary. Efforts by the Soviet state to undermine the traditional Turkmen lifestyle resulted in significant changes in familial and political relationships, religious and cultural observances, and intellectual developments. Thousands of Russians and other Slavs, as well people of various nationalities mainly from the Caucasus, migrated to urban areas of Turkmenia. Turkmenia was industrialized and natural resources were exploited in a limited degree.

Under Soviet rule, all religious beliefs were suppressed by the communist authorities as superstition and "vestiges of the past". Most religious education and religious observances were banned. The vast majority of mosques were closed. An official Muslim Board of Central Asia based in Tashkent was established during World War II to supervise the Islamic faith in Central Asia. For the most of its existion, the Muslim Board functioned mostly as an instrument of propaganda. Atheism affected religious development and contributed to the isolation of the Turkmen people from the international Muslim community. Some religious customs, such as Muslim burial and male circumcision, continued to be practiced throughout the Soviet period, but most religious belief, knowledge, and customs were preserved only in rural areas in "folk form" as a kind of unofficial Islam unsanctioned by the state-run Spiritual Directorate.

Beginning in the 1930s, Moscow kept the republic under strict control. The nationalities policy of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) led to a development of a Turkmen political elite and promoted Russification. Slavs, both in Moscow and Turkmenia, closely supervised the national cadre of government officials and bureaucrats. Generally, Turkmen politicians supported Soviet policies. Moscow initiated nearly all political activity in the republic. Turkmenistan was a largely quiet Soviet republic. The only major poltiical event was a corruption scandal in the mid-1980s that ousted longtime First Secretary Muhammetnazar Gapurow. Many Turkmens were self-dependent, contributing to the low impact of Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of glasnost and perestroika on Turkmenistan. The republic found itself rather unprepared for the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence that followed in 1991.

When other Soviet republics claimed sovereignty over their territory in 1988 and 1989, Turkmenia's leadership also began to criticize Moscow's economic and political policies. After an unanimous vote of its Supreme Soviet, Turkmenistan declared its sovereignty in August 1990. In August 1991, following the failed coup attempt against Gorbachev's rule in Moscow, Turkmenia's communist leader and first president of Turkmenistan Saparmurat Niyazov called for a popular referendum on independence. The official result of the referendum was 94 percent in favor of independence. The republic's Supreme Soviet declared Turkmenistan's independence on October 27, 1991. Turkmenistan gained formal independence from the Soviet Union on December 26, 1991.

As with the other Soviet republics, Turkmenia followed the Marxist–Leninist ideology. The country was governed by the republic's sole party, Communist Party of Turkmenistan, a republican branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

The politics of Turkmenia took place in the framework of a one-party socialist republic. The Supreme Soviet was a unicameral legislature of the republic headed by a Chairman. The Supreme Soviet's building was in Ashkhabad.

Liz Truss

Elizabeth Mary Truss (born 26 July 1975), known as Liz Truss, is a British politician. Truss was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party from 5 September 2022 to 24 October 2022.

She had been the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs from September 2021 to September 2022 in Boris Johnson's cabinet. She was the Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 2017 to 2019 and Member of Parliament (MP) for South West Norfolk since 2010.

She also served as the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord High Chancellor from 2016 to 2017, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs from 2014 to 2016 and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Childcare from 2012 to 2014.

In July 2022, Truss announced her candidacy for Conservative Party leader to replace Boris Johnson in the 2022 Conservative Party leadership election. On 20 July 2022, Truss advanced to the final round of the election and faced Rishi Sunak. On 5 September 2022, it was announced that Truss had defeated her opponent Rishi Sunak in the Conservative leadership race. Truss announced her resignation as leader of the Conservative party on 20 October 2022 after criticisms of her leadership and economic policies which caused a national crisis.

She was replaced by Rishi Sunak after 50 days in office. She was the shortest serving Prime Minister in British history.

Mary Elizabeth Truss was born on 26 July 1975 at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England to John Kenneth and Priscilla Mary Truss ("née" Grasby). From an early age, she has been known by her middle name. Her father worked at the University of Leeds, while her mother was a nurse and teacher.

The family moved to Paisley, Renfrewshire in Scotland when she was four years old, living there from 1979 to 1985. She studied at the University of Oxford.

Truss was an active member of the Liberal Democrats. Truss joined the Conservative Party in 1996.

Truss was elected to the parliament during the 2010 general election to represent South West Norfolk.

On 4 September 2012, Truss was appointed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Education. In this role, she developed some of the policy areas that she had pursued as a backbencher.

In July 2014, Truss was appointed Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Truss said that she fully believed that climate change is happening, and that "human beings have contributed to that".

In July 2016, Truss was appointed as Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor in Theresa May's first ministry. Truss became the first woman to hold either position and the first female Lord Chancellor in the thousand-year history of the office.

After Boris Johnson became Prime Minister, Truss was seen as a candidate for an important cabinet role because of her support of Johnson during the 2019 leadership election. She became Johnson's Secretary of State for International Trade and President of the Board of Trade. After the resignation of Amber Rudd, Truss was also made Minister for Women and Equalities.

In September 2021, Johnson promoted Truss from International Trade Secretary to Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, becoming the second woman to hold the position after Margaret Beckett.

On 10 July 2022, Truss announced her plans to run in the Conservative Party leadership election to replace Boris Johnson.

Truss and Rishi Sunak were chosen by Conservative Party MPs to compete in the final stage of the leadership election. On 5 September 2022, she won the election, beating Sunak by 81,326 votes to 60,399.

On 6 September 2022 Queen Elizabeth II appointed Truss as Prime Minister.
Two days later, Elizabeth II died at the age of 96. Truss is the first British prime minister during Charles III's reign.

When Truss became prime minister, she picked Thérèse Coffey, a close friend, as Deputy Prime Minister and Health Secretary. Truss also picked Kwasi Kwarteng as Chancellor of the Exchequer, James Cleverly as Foreign Secretary and Suella Braverman as Home Secretary. This was the first time in British political history in which no white men were in these four roles.

Early during her time as prime minister, she was criticized over her handling of the economy through tax cuts and limiting energy prices. She cut taxes on businesses and reduced government regulation. Her tax plans were called Trussonomics and were inspired by by the economic policies of U.S. President Ronald Reagan, known as Reaganomics, and Margaret Thatcher-era Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson. Her tax policies were criticized by the International Monetary Fund, U.S. President Joe Biden, senior Conservative politicians Michael Gove and Grant Shapps, and the Bank of England. Her policies caused the pound to fall to a record low against the US dollar and an increase in the cost of government borrowing. In response, she fired Exchequer Chancellor Kwarteng and replaced him with Jeremy Hunt on 14 October 2022.

Five days after firing Kwarteng, Suella Braverman resigned as Home Secretary after 43 days, because of an "honest mistake" involving sharing secure information on a private phone. She also criticized Truss’s leadership in her resignation letter. Truss replaced her with Grant Shapps.

After strong criticisms against her leadership and economic policies, especially from members of her party, on 20 October 2022, Truss announced her plan to resign as prime minister after 45 days in office, making her the shortest serving prime minister in the history of the United Kingdom. She was replaced by former Chancellor of the Exchequer and leadership party rival Rishi Sunak on 25 October 2022, 50 days after being in office. The short length of her premiership was the subject of many jokes. This included a livestream of a lettuce head, comparing the shelf-life of the lettuce to her remaining term.

A poll found Truss to be the least popular UK Prime Minister on record. Many other polls ranked her as extremely unpopular.

In 2000, Truss married accountant Hugh O'Leary. They have two children. Between 2004 and 2005, she had an extramarital affair with Conservative MP Mark Field.

Sacking of Lawrence

The Sacking of Lawrence happened on May 21, 1856, when pro-slavery people came to Lawrence, Kansas and attacked it. Lawrence was an anti-slavery town. They were led by Douglas County Sheriff Samuel J. Jones. The attack made the irregular conflict in Kansas Territory worse. The conflicts later became known as "Bleeding Kansas".

Only one person died, and his death was by accident. However, the pro-slavery people destroyed two free-state newspapers, the "Kansas Free State" and the "Herald of Freedom".

Lawrence, Kansas was created in 1854 by anti-slavery people. They often were attacked by pro-slavery people because Lawrence was anti-slavery. Lawrence had almost been attacked during the Wakarusa War in 1855.

Pro-slavery sheriff Samuel Jones was shot when he was trying to arrest anti-slavery people. Many anti-slavery people believed that Jones being shot was the cause of the attack. Lawrence people made Jones leave after he was shot. Federal Marshal Israel B. Donaldson said that Jones being shot stopped him from following warrants. He decided to send 800 pro-slavery men to Lawrence to destroy anti-slavery newspapers and destroy the Free State Hotel.

On May 21, 1856, Jones and Donaldson came to Lawrence. A group of many men were on Mount Oread, and they had a cannon. Charles L. Robinson's house was taken over and used as Jones's headquarters. Jones's men guarded the roads that went in and out of Lawrence to stop people from leaving. Jones's men flew many flags, such as the state flags of Alabama and South Carolina. Many flags had anti-Free State or pro-slavery messages on them such as "Kansas the Outpost", "Southern Rights", and "Supremacy of the White Race").

Shalor Eldridge, the owner of the Free State Hotel, learned of the coming pro-slavery men, and he came to meet them. Donaldson told him that he and his men would attack Lawrence only if the people of Lawrence resisted his men. Donaldson and Eldridge went to the Free State Hotel. There, Eldridge cooked a good meal that had fresh food and expensive wine. He made this meal so that Donaldson and his men would stay calm. Eldridge was interviewed by Donaldson while he and his men continued to eat the meal, then they left without paying. Shortly after, Donaldson let Jones command his men. Jones then asked to talk to a representative of the town. Samuel C. Pomeroy agreed to meet with Jones and talk to him about the situation. Jones was clear in what he wanted: for the people of Lawrence to give up all of their weapons. Pomeroy argued that there was not much he could do about that, since it was for the people to decide if they would give up their weapons. However, hoping to convince Jones to leave the city peacefully, Pomeroy agreed to give the city's only artillery piece. While Jones did take this cannon, it did not convince him as Pomeroy had hoped.

It was the "Old Sacramento" cannon that the pro-slavers used to try to destroy the Free State Hotel. This weapon had been kept in the Liberty Arsenal until it was taken by pro-slavery forces in 1855. (The cannon would eventually be taken by free-staters later in 1856 during the Second Battle of Franklin.)

While Jones and his men were trying to destory the hotel, the printing offices of the "Kansas Free State" and the "Herald of Freedom" were destroyed; their libraries were thrown out the window, the presses were smashed, and the type was thrown in the river. Any papers left were either thrown into the wind to be carried off or were used by Jones and his men to burn down the Free State Hotel. When the newspapers and the hotel were destoryed, Jones's men then looted the town. As they retreated, they burned Robinson's home on Mount Oread for good measure.

One person—a member of Jones's gang—died during the attack when he was hit in the head by a falling bit of the Free State Hotel.

While the Free State Hotel was destroyed, a man named Shalor Eldridge bought the destroyed ruins of the building. He decided to rebuild it as the "Eldridge House". This building remained until 1863, when it was burned down by William Quantrill during the Lawrence Massacre (after which it would be rebuilt two more times in 1866 and 1926, respectively).

For a many months after the Sack of Lawrence, the city was without a free state newspaper. This was made worse by the fact that Josiah Miller, who ran the "Kansas Free State", decided not to start his newspaper again. George Brown restarted the "Herald of Freedom" in November 1857, so Lawrence had a newspaper again.

Lawrence's only cannon was lost due to the sacking. This would be at least one reason that Free-Staters would attack Franklin's Fort in June and August of 1856; they hoped to get the "Old Sacramento" cannon so they could use it.

LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin II

The LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin ΙΙ was the last Zeppelin built in the time between World War 1 and World War 2. Built from the same blueprints as its sister the LZ-129 Hindenburg, in October, 1937, LZ-130 was modified to use helium after the LZ-129 Hindenburg crash, delaying her first flight. Because helium provides less lift than hydrogen, LZ-130’s passenger capacity was reduced from the 72 carried by Hindenburg to just 40. 

Helium is rare and expensive, so the airship was also modified to not leak helium. However, the United States refused to sell any helium to Germany, so the airship was filled with hydrogen anyway.

The house was sold in 1963, and the building was destroyed in 1964. Parts of the building including bay windows, an oak staircase and balcony were used in the downtown Ramada Inn. That was built in another part of Topeka in 1964.

They built it for "Topeka State Journal" and "Emporia News" newspaper publisher Frank P. MacLennan. MacLennan died in 1933; when his widow died in 1955, she gave "Cedar Crest" to the state of Kansas. She said she would give it to the state only if it is used as a home for the governor of Kansas. The gift included of land near it to be used as a park (now known as MacLennan Park).

Alma Adams

Alma Shealey Adams (born May 27, 1946) is an American politician who represents North Carolina's 12th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. She is a Democrat. Adams served as a member of the North Carolina General Assembly representing the state's 58th House district in Guilford County from her appointment in April 1994 until her election to Congress. She was succeeded by Ralph C. Johnson. A college administrator and art professor from Greensboro, Adams is known for the many distinctive hats that she wears (she claims to own 900). Adams won the 2014 special election North Carolina's 12th congressional district to fill the vacancy created after Mel Watt resigned. By winning, she became the 100th woman serving in the 113th Congress. She won election to a full two-year term at the same time.

Adams was born on May 27, 1946 in High Point, North Carolina. Her parents were Benjamin Shealey and the former Mattie Stokes. She graduated from West Side High School in Newark, New Jersey, in 1964. Adams received her B.S. degree in 1969 and her M.S. degree in 1972, both from North Carolina A&T University and both in Art Education. She continued her studies to receive her Ph.D. in Art Education/Multicultural Education from Ohio State University in 1981.

Adams was a member of the Greensboro City School Board from 1984 to 1986 and a Greensboro City Council member from 1987 until 1994.

She was appointed to the North Carolina House District 26 seat in 1994 to replace Herman Gist, who died in office. The district is in Guilford County and includes most of southeastern Greensboro. She had previously said she was going to challenge Gist for that seat in the Democratic primary that year. After being appointed to the seat, Adams faced conservative businessman and retired engineer O. C. Stafford in the Democratic primary. Adams won the primary election.

Adams then won a full term in the general election, beating Republican Roger G. Coffer. She had a rematch with Stafford in the general elections of 1996 and 1998 (Stafford ran as a Republican). Adams won both elections. In 2000 Adams did not have an opponent in the Democratic primary; she defeated Republican real estate broker Jim Rumley in the general election.

In 2002, after redistricting, Adams' seat was changed from the 26th district to the 58th district. Her only challenger that year was Libertarian lawyer David Williams, who withdrew from the race in October because he was moving to Colorado. His name still appeared on the ballot, but Adams won with around 86% of the vote.

Adams has been challenged for her seat for many years by Republican legal assistant and party activist Olga Morgan Wright. Wright has run for the seat held by Adams in nearly every election since 2004. Adams defeated Wright and Libertarian challenger Walter Sperko with 66% of the vote in 2004. In the next election Adams had no competition in the primary; she defeated Wright in the general election 66%–34%. In 2008, the year that Barack Obama was elected president, Democratic voters had a high rate of participation, and Adams defeated Wright 71.35%–28.65%

In 2008, Adams was elected to a second term as chair of the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus.

She was vice-chair of the Government Committee in the state House. Previously she was chair of the Appropriations Committee as well as vice-chair of the Commerce, Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee.

In 2010, Adams was challenged in the Democratic primary by Ralph C. Johnson. She defeated Johnson with 76.56% of the vote. Adams next faced Republican Darin H. Thomas in the general election, beating him 63.15%–36.85%. In 2012, Adams did not have any primary opposition and defeated Olga Wright in the general election by a margin of 79.86%–20.14%.

In April 2013, Mel Watt, the only congressman to have served the 12th District since its creation in 1993, was appointed as director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Adams ran in the special election to replace him, and won. She was sworn in on November 12, 2014, to complete the remaining seven weeks of Watt's term. After swearing in, Adams became the 100th female member of the congressional class, beating the previous record of 99. Adams formally filed paperwork to run in both the Democratic primary for a full two-year term in the 114th Congress and the special election for the balance of Watt's 11th term. Adams won re-election in 2018.

Analysts thought that Adams was at a geographic disadvantage in the five-way primary for both the special and regular elections (held on the same day). She is from Greensboro, but the bulk of the district's population is in Charlotte. However, with three candidates from Charlotte in the race splitting that region's vote; Adams won both primaries with approximately 44 percent of the vote, a few thousand votes over the 40 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff. She faced Republican Vince Coakley, a former television and radio broadcaster from Matthews, in both the general and special elections, which were held on the same day in November. The 12th was a heavily Democratic district with a majority-black voting population and a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+26, and Adams was favored in both the special and general election. She won both.

Adams is the second woman of color to represent North Carolina in the House. The first was Eva Clayton, who represented much of eastern North Carolina from 1992 to 2002.

In the 2016 presidential election, Adams endorsed Hillary Clinton and pledged her support as a superdelegate.

She is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus, and the Congressional Arts Caucus.


Adams has been a professor of art at Bennett College in Greensboro, as well as the director of the Steel Hall Art Gallery. In 1990, Adams helped co-found, with Eva Hamlin Miller, the African American Atelier, an organization established to increase awareness and appreciation for visual arts and cultures of African Americans.

She is the chairperson of the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus Foundation, which gives scholarships to students who are attending one of North Carolina's Historically Black Colleges and Universities.

Adams is divorced and has two children. She is noted for the many different hats that she wears.


Colin Allred

Colin Zachary Allred (born April 15, 1983) is an American politician and civil rights attorney. He used to be a professional football player. He is a Democrat. Since 2019, he is the U.S. Representative for . That district covers the northeastern corner of Dallas. It also has many of its northeastern suburbs such as Garland, Richardson, the Park Cities and Rowlett.

When he was a football player, he was a linebacker who played for the Tennessee Titans in the National Football League (NFL). Allred stopped playing football to go back to law school for a Juris Doctor degree, from the University of California, Berkeley. He then worked in the Obama administration and the U.S. Attorney's office.

Allred went to Hillcrest High School in Dallas, and then to Baylor University. He played college football at Baylor; he was a linebacker. In December 2005, Allred graduated from Baylor with a B.A. degree in history.

Allred joined the Tennessee Titans after the 2006 NFL Draft on May 4, 2006.

After his football career, Allred went to law school. He graduated from UC Berkeley School of Law in 2014. Then, Allred was a special assistant in the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of General Counsel.

After that, Allred worked as a lawyer at the Perkins Coie law firm, where he worked on voting rights cases. He also served as the lawyer for different political candidates and advocacy groups.

"Politico", a political news source, described him as a "civil rights attorney."

On April 21, 2017, Allred said he would challenge the current Representative from his district, Republican Pete Sessions, in the 2018 election. Allred won the most votes in the Democratic primary, but did not get more than 50 percent; he won by 20 points. Two of the other candidates also used to work in the Obama administration. In the May 22 runoff election, Allred beat Lewisville businesswoman Lillian Salerno, receiving 69.5% of the vote.

Allred then competed with Sessions for the 32nd District seat. As of the November 2016 election, the seat was considered a "swing district" because Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton received marginally more votes than Donald Trump even as Sessions, a Republican, was reelected with no major-party opposition. Allred has described himself as a moderate Democrat.

On November 6, 2018, Allred was elected to the United States House of Representatives for the 32nd district of Texas. Allred's victory was considered an upset because Sessions has been in Congress since 1997 and has represented the 32nd District since 2003. Allred became the second person to represent this district since it was created in 2003, and the first Democrat. Sessions used to represent the nearby 5th District, but had switched after the district maps were changed.

In February 2019, Allred endorsed Julian Castro in the 2020 presidential race. Castro, like Allred, is from Texas. Castro used to be the Housing and Urban Development Secretary.

Allred was elected in November 2018 as co-president of the 116th Congressional Freshman Class. The other president was Representative Haley Stevens of Michigan.



Allred married Alexandra Eber on March 25, 2017. Their son, Jordan, was born on February 12, 2019.

Smoky Hills

The Smoky Hills are an upland area of hills in the Great Plains are of North America. They are in the Midwestern United States, mostly in north-central Kansas and a small part of south-central Nebraska.

The Republican River, Saline River, Solomon River, and Smoky Hill River all go east through the Smoky Hills. This is because they start in the High Plains. Starting in the 1940s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation dammed these rivers at points in the Smoky Hills for flood control and irrigation reasons. This created many reservoirs. These include Cedar Bluff Reservoir, Kanopolis Lake, Kirwin Reservoir, Waconda Lake, Webster Reservoir, and Wilson Lake.

Land in the Smoky Hills is mostly used for farming. The region doesn't have very many people. There are cities that are small, but there are no big cities. The two biggest cities in the Smoky Hills region are Salina, Kansas and Hays, Kansas.

Lawrence Public Library

The Lawrence Public Library is a public library in Lawrence, Kansas.

The first library in Lawrence was built in October 1854. It cost $1 per year to be a member. People could pay $25 to be a member for their life. Amos A. Lawrence brought many books to Lawrence in 1855.

In 1863, the library burned in Quantrill's Raid. A new library was built in 1866.

In the first two years of the library, 75 volumes were purchased, and 150 volumes were donated. The city took control of the library in September 1871. They moved it into the Lawrence National Bank building. It took up three rooms on the second floor.

The old library was getting too many books, so they needed to build a bigger library. They had 6,000 volumes. $1 per year was not enough money to build a new library. One resident, Peter Emery, asked philanthropist Andrew Carnegie to give money for a new library. Carnegie said yes, and he gave $27,500 for a new library. He said he would only give this money if Lawrence made the new library free to use, and if they spent $2,750 per year to maintain it. It was put to a vote, and the city voted yes by a lot. The library officially opened to on December 26, 1904.

After the Carnegie library opened, the Lawrence Public Library grew a lot. By 1922 children liked the library so much that a new room was added to for the children to use. By 1936, 40% of all people in Lawrence had a library card. In 1937, they had to make their storage bigger. They made the library better in 1957. They wanted to make it more modern.

The Carnegie Library didn't have enough space for the amount of books they had. Lawrence had an idea to make a new building. They decided that the new building would be close to the old building. In 1970, a vote in the city for $1,575,000 to be used for a new building passed easily. This building opened in August 1972. The Carnegie building became the location for the Friends of the Library association.

On November 10, 2010 an $18 million budget was proposed by the Library Board of Trustees. They said that since 1972, the number of people who used the library more than doubled. This proposal was accepted by voters in 2010. Construction finished in July 2014.

After the new building opened, the Lawrence Public Library won the AIA/ALA Library Building Award in 2016. Elle Decor said the library was 16th in the top "50 Best Libraries in America".

Matt Stairs

Matthew Wade Stairs (born February 27, 1968) is a Canadian former professional baseball outfielder, first baseman, and designated hitter, who holds the record for most pinch-hit home runs in Major League Baseball (MLB) history with 23. His pinch-hit home run in the eighth inning of Game 4 in the 2008 National League Championship Series off the Los Angeles Dodgers reliever Jonathan Broxton was called one of the most memorable home runs in Phillies history.

In his career, Stairs played for more teams than any position player in MLB history (12 — technically 13 teams, but 12 franchises, as he played for the Montreal Expos and Washington Nationals); Edwin Jackson holds the record for pitchers and all players at 14.

He was the second Canadian-born player ever to hit more than thirty-five home runs in a season, and only the second to hit more than 25 home runs and drive in more than 100 runs in back-to-back seasons. He ranks either first or second in power hitting categories for Canadian major leaguers. Stairs also holds the all-time MLB record of home runs hit as a pinch-hitter with 23. His ability to pinch hit made him a valuable asset to several teams and earned him the nickname "Matt Stairs – Professional Hitter". Stairs, Larry Walker, Justin Morneau, Jason Bay, and Joey Votto are the only Canadian MLB players to hit at least 200 career home runs. On February 4, 2015, Stairs was elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.

On May 11, 2006, in the first inning of a game versus the New York Mets, Rowand made a spectacular play by smashing into the center field fence of Citizens Bank Park face first at full speed in order to run down a deep fly ball off the bat of Xavier Nady with the bases loaded, that would otherwise have scored three runs. Rowand suffered a broken nose and severe lacerations to his face. The Phillies won the game, 2-0, in a rain-shortened 5-inning game. He underwent seven hours of surgery to repair the nose, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list. He returned to the starting lineup on May 27, 2006.

On August 21, 2006, in a game against the Chicago Cubs, Rowand collided with second baseman Chase Utley and broke his ankle. He was on the disabled list for the remainder of the regular season.

In 2007, a contract year, proved to be Rowand's breakthrough, both statistically and in recognition around baseball. He finished with a batting average of .309, 27 home runs, 89 runs batted in, and 6 stolen bases. On July 10, 2007, Rowand was selected to the 2007 MLB All-Star Game in San Francisco, for his first All-Star appearance. In the bottom of the 9th, with the bases loaded, two outs, and the AL leading 5-4, Rowand flew out to Alex Ríos in right field to end the game helping give the American League home field advantage in the 2007 World Series. He earned his first Gold Glove Award for his outfield play that year, including 11 outfield assists and only 2 errors all season.

He was the top pitcher on the team entering the 2008 season, and during the Phillies' postseason run, during which they ultimately won the 2008 World Series over the Tampa Bay Rays, he won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. After the 2008 season, Hamels signed a three-year contract with the Phillies. His statistics declined over the next two seasons, struggling through a tumultuous 2009 campaign and somewhat bouncing back in 2010, however still not approaching his 2008 numbers. Over the next few seasons, Hamels was joined by fellow All-Star pitchers including Roy Halladay, Cliff Lee, and Roy Oswalt and flourished with them, putting up some of his top career seasons before suffering from poor run support in 2013. With the decline of his aging teammates, the team missed the postseason for the next few years, but Hamels remained one of the Phillies' consistent stars. Hamels was traded to the Texas Rangers in 2015, and he subsequently sparked their run to the AL West title that season. He spent parts of four seasons with the Rangers, including an All-Star season in 2016, before being traded to the Cubs in 2018.

Nebulizer

A nebulizer is a small machine that creates a mist out of liquid medication, allowing for quicker and easier absorption of medication into the lungs. Typically, nebulizers come in both electric or battery-run versions, and are either portable or meant to sit on a table and plug into a wall.

It is also used for the patients with runny nose or nasal stroke. A nebulizer delivers liquid medication via pressurized air. While individuals with asthma typically use both nebulizers and inhalers, occasionally, a nebulizer may be easier to use — especially when it comes to young children who may not have the proper technique for an inhaler.

A nebulizer is helpful for a variety of conditions, including:


There are three main types of nebulizers:


Reginald's Tower

Reginald's Tower is a historic tower in Waterford, Ireland. The tower has been in use for many centuries and is an important landmark in Waterford and an important part of its medieval defence. It is the oldest civic building in Ireland and it is the only city monument in Ireland to retain a Norse or Viking name.

Reginald's Tower was built by the Normans when they came to Waterford. The tower's name is derived from a form of the Irish name "Raghnall". The tower's name seems to refer to one of the many Viking rulers of the town that bore the name. It might be Ragnall mac Gillemaire, the last Norse ruler of the town. The tower was probably built in the 13th or 14th century; it may have been constructed between 1253 and 1280. In 1185 Prince John of England landed in Waterford and organised the rebuilding of the city walls, including the tower.

The tower is 54 feet high and it is circular. It is 42½ feet in diameter with a cone-shaped roof. There is a spiral staircase within the thick walls - these are 10 feet wide at the base, going down to 7 feet at the top. It was part of the old city walls of Waterford which were in a triangle formed by three structures — Turgesius Tower on Barronstrand Street, St. Martins Castle on Lady Lane, and Reginald’s Tower at the Quay and the Mall. It was on the high ground between St. John's River on the southeast (since drained, and now known as the Mall) and the River Suir to the north. It is also very close to the historic French Church. It is also known as the Ring Tower. It was one of seventeen towers which circled the city of Waterford in medieval times. Today, it is the largest of the six surviving towers, which are considered the best examples of medieval urban defence in Ireland. The other surviving towers are the Watch Tower, Double Tower, French Tower, Semi-Lunar Tower and Beach Tower.

The tower has been used as a coin mint, a prison, and a military storehouse. It is also famous for being the location of the wedding of Richard de Clare, the second Earl of Pembroke, and Aoife (pronounced eefa), daughter of Dermot MacMurrough, King of Leinster. It sometimes was a royal castle and was visited by King John in 1210, who ordered new coins to be made there. Richard II visited the tower in 1394 and again in 1399. He used the tower to store his munitions. On 27 July 1399, Richard left Reginald's Tower as King of England and Wales; on his arrival in England, he was captured by the future Henry IV. 

In 1463, coins were minted in Reginald's Tower by order of the Irish Parliament, which, at that time, was meeting in the city. The coins had the words "Civitas Waterford" struck on one side. In 1495, the tower’s cannons successfully beat off the forces of Perkin Warbeck, the pretender to the throne of Henry VII. Cannons from the tower sank one of his ships during an 11-day battle. This was the first successful use of artillery by an Irish city. A cannon from this ship was recovered from the River Suir in 1901. This victory earned the city its motto "Urbs Intacta Manet" - "Waterford remains the unconquered city".

In 1649, Waterford was attacked by the army of Oliver Cromwell, but he failed to capture the city. They returned in 1650, and this time they were successful. A cannonball, visible high up the wall on the north side of the building, is lodged firmly in the wall, and is said to be from this siege.

In 1690, following his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne, James II of England is supposed to have climbed to the top of the tower to take a last look at his lost kingdom before embarking for exile in France.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, the tower was used to store ammunition. In the early 19th century it was a prison.

In 1861, Reginald's Tower became the property of the Waterford Corporation, and the house of the Chief Constable of Waterford. It continued to be lived in until 1954 when the last person left and the building was turned into a museum. During the Second World War it was an air raid shelter. Now it is the Waterford Viking Museum and exhibits many of the archaeological finds from the 2003 dig at Woodstown on the River Suir near the city.

It is located in the area of Waterford Viking Triangle in the centre of Waterford city. A Viking longship is kept outside Reginald's Tower.

Moseley grew up in Livingston, Texas where he played football at Livingston High School. After high school, he attended Texas A&M University from 1965 to 1966 and Stephen F. Austin State University (SFA) from 1967 to 1969. He played quarterback while at both schools until his senior season at SFA when he made the switch to placekicker. In that season, he set Lone Star Conference records for most points in a game and most field goals in a season.

Moseley was selected 346th overall in the 14th round of the 1970 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles making him the first kicker ever drafted in the NFL. He was released by the Eagles in 1971 and signed by the Houston Oilers only to be released again in 1972. He spent two years out of the NFL before moving back to Livingston, Texas, where he installed septic systems and coached high school sports. During this time, he sent letters to two dozen NFL teams and regularly practiced kicking with his children returning his kicks. In 1974, the Washington Redskins signed him as a free agent.

With the retirement of the Minnesota Vikings' Rick Danmeier in 1982, Moseley became the only full-time straight on placekicker in the National Football League since then. In the 1960s, the "soccer-style" of kicking (wherein the kicker approaches the ball at an angle and kicks it with the instep) was introduced by the Hungarian brothers Pete and Charlie Gogolak. It is now universal in the NFL and other levels.

In the strike-shortened 1982 season, Moseley converted 23 straight field goals from 1981-82,(a record at the time), made a league-leading 20 of 21 field goals, a then-record 95.2 success rate, and was responsible for 76 points. He became the first placekicker to ever win the Associated Press NFL Most Valuable Player. Moseley had a much rougher time in the postseason as he missed four field goals in Washington's two postseason games. In the Washington Redskins' 27–17 victory in Super Bowl XVII over the Miami Dolphins, Moseley kicked two field goals. He was successful on all three of his extra point attempts. During the following season, he led the NFL in scoring with 161 points. He also kicked the game-winning field goal in Washington's 24-21 win over the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC championship game. He only missed four prior attempts in the game.

In 1986, Moseley was released by the Washington Redskins mid-season. He remains their all-time leading scorer with 1,207 points. He signed with the Cleveland Browns and retired at the end of the season, helping them win their divisional playoff game against the New York Jets with a game-winning field goal in double overtime despite missing two field goals in regulation and another in the first overtime period.

In his career, Moseley was successful on 300 out of 457 field-goal attempts (65%), successful on 482 out of 512 extra points attempts (94%), and scored a total of 1,382 points. He led the NFL in field goals made four times. 


Civil Works Administration

The Civil Works Administration (CWA) was a program that created jobs. It did not last long. It was created by the New Deal during the Great Depression. The jobs were manual-labor jobs for millions of unemployed workers. The jobs were temporary, meaning the workers didn't work for a very long time. This lasted during winter of 1933–34. President Franklin D. Roosevelt told everyone about the CWA on November 8, 1933, and put Harry L. Hopkins in charge of it.

The CWA was a project created from the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). The CWA created construction jobs, mainly making new buildings and bridges (or making them better). It ended on March 31, 1934. $200 million per month was spent. It gave jobs to four million people.

Balanced budget

A balanced budget is a budget in which the amount of money spent is the same as the amount of money received. In general, it's a budget that has no budget deficit (spending more money than one has), but it could have a budget surplus (spending less money than one has).

Balanced budgets and budget deficits are a controversial issue among economists and politicians. Some economists think that a balanced budget can lower interest rates, increase investment, shrink trade deficits, and help the economy grow. Other economists think that among countries that can print their own money balanced budgets aren't as important. These economists also say that government spending can boost productivity, innovation, and savings in the private sector. Many economists who think this are supporters of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT).

DWDB-TV

DWDB-TV (channel 27) is a television station in Metro Manila, Philippines, serving as the flagship of the GTV network. It is owned and operated by GMA Network, Inc. alongside GMA flagship DZBB-TV (channel 7). Both stations share studios at the GMA Network Center, EDSA corner Timog Avenue, Diliman, Quezon City, while DWDB-TV's hybrid analog and digital transmitting facility is located at the GMA Tower of Power, Tandang Sora Avenue, Barangay Culiat, Quezon City (sharing facilities with sister stations GMA 7 and Barangay LS 97.1).

DWDB-TV signed on for the first time on August 27, 1995, under the on-air brand Citynet Television 27 (or just Citynet 27). The station was programmed like an independent stationGMA intended Citynet 27 to be its main outlet for imported programming (particularly from the United States), freeing up slots in GMA Network's schedule for more domestic productions. Aside from an English dub of the Hispanic telenovela "Ka Ina" (produced and broadcast by Venezuelan TV network Venevisión), the only locally produced program on the station was Citynet Television News, a flagship TV news show produced by GMA News and Public Affairs.

However, by 1999, the costs of operating the station in this format were becoming too high for GMA as well as the intense competition from Studio 23 (later renamed as ABS-CBN Sports and Action in 2014), a UHF television network owned by AMCARA Broadcasting Network and operated by ABS-CBN Corporation. As a result, DWDB was turned into a music channel under the interim branding EMC, the Entertainment Music Channelwhich was also the country's first locally operated music channel. A few months later, GMA reached a deal with Asian broadcaster STAR TV to allow DWDB to be a carrier of Channel V Philippines, which took effect December 19, 1999. GMA had already aired selected Channel V programming from its international version (which made the former VJ's and Filipino descented Trey Farley and Joey Mead familiar to viewers of DWDB). This arrangement did not last longa stake in GMA was recently purchased by the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, who already owned MTV Philippines through the Nation Broadcasting Corporation and its parent company MediaQuest Holdings. This conflict of interest, along with the increasing competition from the MTV affiliated network, led to the channel signing-off on July 25, 2001.

Programming would return to DWDB in 2004 as the relay of GMA-7 Manila with the logo of GMA was covered by the logo of Citynet. In November 2005, the station became a repeater of DZOE 11, which served as the flagship for GMA's newly-secondary national network QTV (or Quality Television, later renamed to just Q). GMA had reached an agreement with its owner ZOE Broadcasting Network to allow GMA to handle programming for the station in exchange for providing upgraded facilities for the broadcaster and airing ZOE-produced programming in QTV's lineup. DWDB's UHF signal had the advantage of easier to receive in the southern areas of Metro Manila, especially in the metropolitan cities of Makati and Pasay.

This practice was discontinued in 2007, as DWDB's channel number was vacated for use in trials of digital television.

In February 2013, GMA started its digital test broadcasts, simulcasting both GMA-7 and GMA News TV-11 using the Japanese ISDB-T digital TV platform using the channel's frequency.

On May 15, 2019, GMA Network's digital test broadcasts used the same frequency as its digital feed, and it also started its initial digital test broadcast on UHF Channel 15 (479.143 MHz),

On April 7, 2011, ZOE Broadcasting Network and GMA/Citynet announced that their blocktime agreement would expire by the end of January 2012. This ended their day partnership and in turn, their blocktime lease on VHF Channel 11 after 7 years. ZOE Broadcasting Network was reported to simulcast Light TV 33 upon termination of the agreement, but ZOE had no official statement yet on its future plans, however the network became active again on June 22, 2020, after making a deal with new blocktime partner and erstwhile former rival network ABS-CBN to open A2Z Channel 11. As a result, Channel 27 digital broadcast was planned to switch off on January 3, 2012, as the station was supposedly conducting its test broadcast on the said date. The channel in turn, was to be re-utilized to broadcast GMA News TV in analog by February 21, 2012, after 18 years of inactivity.

However, GMA Network had to allot time for the digital television viewers to re-scan their digital boxes in order to continue watching their channels in a different frequency assignment. As a result of this, GMA Network decided to move their official relaunch date from June 3 to 4. The station successfully signed on for the first time upon its return to analog television at 6:00 a.m. PHT, after conducting test broadcasts during off-air hours of digital signal for the past days after its announcement of this move, and it now served as the originating station of GMA News TV in Manila. It also acts as the main feed station nationwide with its regional counterparts (like in Cebu and Davao). On the other hand, after the transition, the former channel, missed the said shut-off, resulting to a broadcast conflict of the two channels that day. However they lowered their signal, until it officially signed off on June 5, 2019.

After 20 months since its separation with ZOE TV Channel 11 (its originating channel assignment since 2011) and after nearly 10 years on the air, GMA News TV was officially relaunched as GTV as a news, entertainment, and sports channel, similar to the format of Citynet Television and Q, but retaining some of news programming from the previous channel branding.

The newly-branded station signed-on for the first time on February 22, 2021, using the GMA News TV sign-on and sign-off notices. GTV began using its own sign-on and sign-off notices on February 27, 2021.

DWDB-TV's feed is broadcast on DZBB-TV digital subchannel operates on UHF channel 15 (479.143 MHz) and broadcasts on the following subchannels:

According to a December 2017 press release, the station's upgraded signal transmission covered the areas of Metro Manila, Rizal, Cavite, Laguna, Bulacan and parts of Pampanga, Bataan, Nueva Ecija, and Batangas.

On April 24, 2019, GMA/Citynet announced that it would terminate its blocktime agreement with ZOE Broadcasting Network by the end of May 2019. The split comes after the release of GMA's 2018 financial report which declared the increasing lease payments that the network contributes to ZOE for the past three years (from in 2016 to almost a billion pesos in 2018). Third-party sources reported that Channel 11 would simulcast ZOE's sister station DZOZ-DTV channel 33 after the termination of the agreement, but ZOE had no official statement yet on its future plans. GNTV Manila's intellectual unit (master control, sales, and employees), on the other hand, was successfully transferred to DWDB-TV on June 4, 2019, for the remainder of the analog broadcast run.

On May 15, 2019, GMA Network began to transmit its digital test broadcast on UHF Channel 15 (479.143 MHz) as its permanent frequency assigned by National Telecommunications Commission.

Starting 27 February 2023, DWDB-TV's feed is broadcast output on DZBB-TV, along with GMA Networks's other digital stations, has been seen on 16:9 widescreen format.

Cliff Morrison

Cliff Morrison is an activist and a nurse who established the first hospital ward for treating AIDS patients in the United States. Ward 5B was established in San Francisco General Hospital in 1983. When the ward was opened there was little known about this illness, and patients with the disease were regarded as worthy of disgrace and/or disapproval.
When Ward 5B was opened AIDS was considered a death sentence. Every single person diagnosed with AIDS died in those days. No one knew what caused this disease and how it was passed on from person to person. Some of the caregivers refused to treat patients. Patients in hospitals would not be bathed, because nurses did not want to touch them for fear of contracting AIDS themselves.

Ward 5B was the first hospital ward where the medical team comforted patients by touching them. Patients were allowed to furnish their rooms and make them like home. They were even allowed to bring in pets.Families and partners were allowed to visit patients any time.

Ward 5B became a model for many other hospitals in the United States and in other countries.
Cliff Morrison grew up in Live Oak, Florida. His family was a very poor. When he was young he worked on his family’s farm. The family had no car, no telephone, no television and no access to healthcare.

At age twelve Morrison got a job at a local hospital mopping floors, taking out trash, and working in the laundry. He worked his way up to orderly. Doctors and nurses at the hospital liked him. They encouraged him to go to college and helped him get a scholarship.

In 1969 Morrison started studying at Florida Community College in Jacksonville when he was 17 years old. He was the youngest student ever in the nursing program. He was also the first person in his family to go to college. 

Morrison admits to being embarrassed studying what is considered a woman’s profession. However, earning $10,000 as a nurse would allow him to enter medical school if he wanted to. Afterwards he moved to Miami to complete his education. 

In 1980, Morrison became a clinical nurse specialist in the Department of Psychiatry and Forensic Services at San Francisco General.

After being in power for seven years the People’s United Party was desperate to win the 2006 Belizean municipal elections and govern the country like never before.

Indian Space Research Organisation

The Indian Space Research Organisation is the agency of India that deals with space exploration and astronomy. Also known as ISRO, the organisation has made many successes since its creation in 1969. It built and launched the Mars Orbiter Mission which made India the first country to get to Mars on its first try.

Organised research about space in India was led by two scientists: Vikram Sarabhai and Homi Bhaba. Bhaba was the secretary of the Department of Atomic Energy when it was founded in 1950. He supported Sarabhai in creating India's first rocket launch station. In 1962, the Indian National Committee for Space Research was set up by India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1969, ISRO was created to follow INCOSPAR.

Like other space programs, ISRO has had many successes and failures. In the beginning, ISRO built satellites that were then launched by other countries, like the Soviet Union. Later, ISRO built many types of rockets. Some of those rockets are now decommissioned, meaning ISRO does not use them anymore. In the future, India also wants to send people to space and send more missions to other planets. 

During the 1960s and 1970s India began its own rocket program. ISRO has had five different types of rockets.

The Satellite Launch Vehicle was a 4-stage solid-propellant light launcher. It was supposed to be tall and be able to carry . The first launch was in 1979 and launched every year until 1983. It launched successfully for the first time on July 18, 1980. This means that India is the sixth country to get spaceflight by itself. It is now decomissioned.

The Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle was a five-stage solid propellant rocket. It was able to carry into low Earth orbit. The design was based on the SLV and the project started in the 1980s. The rocket was tested in 1987, 1988, 1992, and 1994 and only two of them were successful. It is now decommissioned.

The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle uses an expendable launch system to carry things into space. It is still in use.

The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle also uses an expendable launch system, this time to launch INSAT-type satellites. Currently it is India's second-heaviest launch vehicle and can launch up to into low Earth orbit. There are multiple marks, or versions of this rocket. It is still in use.

India's first satellite, which was called the Aryabhata, was launched by the Soviet Union. Since then India has built and launched many different satellites.

Rohini is a series of four satellites. These satellites were launched by the Satellite Launch Vehicle, and three of them were able to make it into orbit. 

The Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) is a series of satellites built and launched by ISRO. These help India with telecommunications, broadcasting, meteorology, and search-and-rescue.

The South Asia Satellite is a communications satellite launched in 2017 as a gift to the other countries in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. 

Also known as GAGAN, this is a national plan for satellite navigation. 

The Independent Regional Navigation Satellite System is made to have accurate position information to people in India as well as 1500 km from its borders. It is made like this because in bad situations, people cannot rely on GPS. ISRO first planned to launch the satellites between 2012 and 2014, but it had to be moved to later years.

The first Indian cosmonaut is Rakesh Sharma, who flew with two Russians in Salyut 7 in 1984. The first female Indian astronaut was Kalpana Chawla. She died in in 2003. The second female Indian astronaut, Sunita Williams, spent 321 days 17 hours 15 minutes in space.

In 2008 ISRO sent Chandrayaan-1 to the moon. It helped discover evidence of water on the moon. ISRO flew the Mars Orbiter Mission in 2013 and it reached Mars in 2014, making India the 4th country to put a spacecraft in orbit around Mars.

Chandrayaan-2 was India's second moon mission. It was launched on 22 July 2019 at 2:43 PM IST (09:13 UTC) to the Moon by a Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV Mk III). It includes an orbiter, lander, and rover that would study the moon both on and above the surface. The mission spent some time orbiting Earth before going to the moon. The lander failed to reach the lunar south pole on 6 September 2019 due to a software glitch.
India plans to repeat Chandrayaan-3 by 2023.

The next Mars mission will be the Mars Orbiter Mission 2, and will be launched in 2024. 

The first mission to the Sun will be a probe called Aditya-L1. It was originally planned for 2012, but was delayed to 2021 and then January 2023. It will study solar wind and space weather.

The first mission to Venus will be an orbiter mission called Shukrayaan-1, that will launch in 2024.

In 2018, prime minister Narendra Modi said that India will send astronauts into space by 2022.

Earth phase

The Earth phase, Terra phase, Terrestrial phase or phase of the Earth, is the shape of the directly sunlit portion of the Earth as viewed from the Moon (or elsewhere extraterrestrially). From the Moon, the Earth phases gradually and cyclically change over a period of about a month, as the orbital positions of the Moon around the Earth and of the Earth around the Sun shift.

Among the most prominent features of the Moon's sky is Earth. Earth's apparent size is four times the Moon's as seen from Earth. However, because the Moon's orbit is eccentric, Earth's size in the sky may be a bit smaller or larger at times. Earth shows phases, just like the Moon does for observers on the Earth. The phases, however, are opposite; when the observer on the Earth sees the "full Moon", the observer on the Moon sees a "new Earth", and vice versa. Earth's albedo is three times as high as that of the Moon (due in part to its whitish cloud cover), and coupled with the wider area, the "full Earth" glows over 50 times brighter than the "full Moon" does for the observer on Earth. This Earth light reflected on the Moon's darkened near-side half is bright enough to be visible from Earth – a phenomenon known as Earthshine.

As a result of the Moon's synchronous rotation, one side of the Moon (the "near side") is permanently turned towards Earth, and the other side, the "far side", mostly cannot be seen from Earth. This means, conversely, that Earth can be seen only from the near side of the Moon and would always be invisible from the far side.

If the Moon's rotation were purely synchronous, Earth would not have any noticeable movement in the Moon's sky. However, due to the Moon's libration, Earth does perform a slow and complex wobbling movement. Once a month, as seen from the Moon, Earth traces out a small oval. The exact shape and orientation of this oval depend on one's location on the Moon. As a result, near the boundary of the near and far sides of the Moon, Earth is sometimes below the horizon and sometimes above it.

To be aware, although genuine photographs of the Earth viewed from the Moon exist, many from NASA, some photographs shared on social media, that are purported to be the Earth viewed from the Moon, may not be real.

Earth and the Sun sometimes meet in the lunar sky, causing an eclipse. On Earth, one would see a lunar eclipse, when the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow; meanwhile on the Moon, one would see a solar eclipse, when the Sun goes behind the Earth. Since the apparent diameter of the Earth is four times as large as that of the Sun, the Sun would be hidden behind the Earth for hours. Earth's atmosphere would be visible as a reddish ring. During the Apollo 15 mission, an attempt was made to use the Lunar Roving Vehicle's TV camera to view such an eclipse, but the camera or its power source failed after the astronauts left for Earth.

Solar eclipse shadows, when the Moon blocks sunlight to the Earth, on the other hand, would not be as spectacular for observers on the Moon viewing the Earth: the Moon's umbra nearly tapers out at the Earth's surface. A blurry dark patch would be barely visible. The effect would be comparable to the shadow of a golf ball cast by sunlight on an object away. Observers on the Moon with telescopes might be able to discern the umbral shadow as a black spot at the center of a less dark region (penumbra) traveling across the full Earth's disk. It would look essentially the same as it does to the Deep Space Climate Observatory, which orbits Earth at the L1 Lagrangian point in the Sun-Earth system, from Earth.

In summary, whenever an eclipse of some sort is occurring on Earth, an eclipse of another sort is occurring on the Moon. Eclipses occur for observers on both Earth and the Moon whenever the two bodies and the Sun align in a straight line, or syzygy.

Sailing (sport)

The sport of sailing is racing other boats around a track or course which is marked with floating buoys or other fixed marks. Boats can be from small dinghies to large yachts. Usually, the small boats will just race each other and be of the same type. This is called one-design racing. Larger boats will often be of different sizes and race with a handicap system.

On the water, a large sailing competition among different boats is a regatta. This is usually a number of races, where the boat crew that performs the best over the series of races is the winner. A lot of racing is done around buoys or marks in safe water near the shore but some longer offshore races cross open water.

It could be said that the sport of international yacht racing began with the America's Cup in 1851. A group of members from the New York Yacht Club built a 101-foot schooner which they called America. This yacht was sailed to England where it won a challenge race for a trophy called the Hundred Guineas Cup. The race course took them around the Isle of Wight. This trophy was subsequently renamed The America's Cup and remained with the New York Yacht Club until 1983. An Australian yacht called Australia 2 finally took it from them after 132-years.

There are a number of famous yacht races being held every year is different parts of the world. These are held using large yachts and involve racing for a number of days without stopping. It is a test of skill and strength over a long time.

Some of the most famous races are:

Several famous round-the-world races are held also and these are:

The oldest known one-design sailing dinghy is the Water Wag. In 1887 a Mr Thomas Middleton proposed the idea of one design sailing punts, with centreboards all built and rigged the same. A number of these were built and the first race took place on April 12, 1887, in Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire) Harbour near Dublin in Ireland.

Now dinghy racing is a worldwide sport and holds events and championships in many classes every year.
This is done entirely in small boats known as keelboats and dinghies. A keelboat has a weighted keel to keep it upright and a dinghy just uses a centreboard and the boat must be balanced by the crew. These were divided into different groups of identical boats called Classes. The first sailing Olympics took place in 1900 at Meulan near Le Havre in France. Over the years the classes of boats allowed to compete have changed because of new design and technology.

Races are sailed in fleets of equal boats racing around the same course at the same time. These race courses include different sailing angles: upwind, downwind and reaching.

This is one boat against another over a short course. It is important that the boats are the same and it is the normal race now used for the America's Cup but it is also sometimes used for racing in yacht clubs.

The Racing Rules of Sailing are used for the sport of yacht racing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, model boat racing, dinghy racing and any other form of racing around a course with more than one boat while powered by the wind.

Judicial activism

Judicial activism is about judicial decisions that are thought of being based on personal opinion, rather than on existing law. It is sometimes used as an antonym of judicial restraint.

Kansas Supreme Court

The Kansas Supreme Court is the most powerful court in the state of Kansas. It has seven justices. It is led by Chief Justice Lawton Nuss, the court supervises the legal profession, administers the judicial branch, and serves as the state court of last resort in the appeals process.

After the Kansas–Nebraska Act passed in 1854, President Franklin Pierce chose Samuel Dexter LeCompte as the first chief justice of the Supreme Court of the Kansas Territory.

In "State v. Limon", the Kansas Supreme Court unanimously struck down part of a law that sentenced Matthew Limon to prison over a decade longer than a heterosexual would have received. This was because there were different age of consent laws for homosexuals.

The court has ruled that the $2.7 billion in school funding was not good enough and was given out unfairly. It then suggested the Kansas legislature increase money for schools and change the way the money was given out. Many Republicans saw this as judicial activism. Some Republicans called for changes in how justices are chosen.

In "Hermesmann v. Seyer", the Court said that a woman is can sue the father of her child for child support even if conception happened because of a criminal act (such as statutory rape) committed by the woman against the father. It also said that a mother being a possible criminal due to the criminal statutes had nothing to do with determining the father's child support amount.

The Eldridge Hotel

The Eldridge House Hotel (often called the Eldridge Hotel or simply the Eldridge) is a historic building on Massachusetts Street, in downtown Lawrence, Kansas. The building is named after Shalor Eldridge. He was an important anti-slavery person who built the building in the mid-1800s. The building is currently used as a hotel.

The Eldridge House Hotel can trace its origin back to the New England Emigrant Aid Company, which was a transportation company in Boston, Massachusetts. They wanted to bring anti-slavery people to Kansas. This was because of the Kansas-Nebraska Act allowing residents in a territory to decide if they wanted slavery. The company built a resting place in Lawrence for these people. They called it the Free State Hotel.

On May 21, 1856, Douglas County sheriff Samuel J. Jones and a big group of pro-slavery men came to Lawrence. They burned down the Free State Hotel as part of the Sack of Lawrence. After this, the anti-slavery man Shalor Eldridge built a new hotel. He called it the Eldridge House, named after himself. This building stayed until August 21, 1863, when Confederate leader William Quantrill and his raiders burned the hotel and the city to the ground.

Eldridge began to build another hotel. It finished in 1866 under George W. Deitzler. This building was updated in 1925; the new version stayed until the mid-to-late 1960s, when it closed due to competition with motels. The building became an apartment complex on July 1, 1970. People in Lawrence wanted to see the Eldridge re-open as a hotel again in the 1980s. A group of investors got $1 million, and the city of Lawrence also gave $2 million to make this happen. In the late 1980s, the building became a hotel again. In 2004, the hotel was purchased by a new group of investors. They changed it back "to its original 1925 grandeur (the style of the hotel)." The hotel opened in 2005.
