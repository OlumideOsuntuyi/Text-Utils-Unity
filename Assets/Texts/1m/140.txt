Bytecode

Bytecode, also termed portable code or p-code, is a form of instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter. Unlike human-readable source code, bytecodes are compact numeric codes, constants, and references (normally numeric addresses) that encode the result of compiler parsing and performing semantic analysis of things like type, scope, and nesting depths of program objects.
The name bytecode stems from instruction sets that have one-byte opcodes followed by optional parameters. Intermediate representations such as bytecode may be output by programming language implementations to ease interpretation, or it may be used to reduce hardware and operating system dependence by allowing the same code to run cross-platform, on different devices. Bytecode may often be either directly executed on a virtual machine (a p-code machine i.e., interpreter), or it may be further compiled into machine code for better performance.

Since bytecode instructions are processed by software, they may be arbitrarily complex, but are nonetheless often akin to traditional hardware instructions: virtual stack machines are the most common, but virtual register machines have been built also. Different parts may often be stored in separate files, similar to object modules, but dynamically loaded during execution.


A bytecode program may be executed by parsing and "directly" executing the instructions, one at a time. This kind of "bytecode interpreter" is very portable. Some systems, called dynamic translators, or "just-in-time" (JIT) compilers, translate bytecode into machine code as necessary at runtime. This makes the virtual machine hardware-specific but does not lose the portability of the bytecode. For example, Java and Smalltalk code is typically stored in bytecode format, which is typically then JIT compiled to translate the bytecode to machine code before execution. This introduces a delay before a program is run, when the bytecode is compiled to native machine code, but improves execution speed considerably compared to interpreting source code directly, normally by around an order of magnitude (10x).

Because of its performance advantage, today many language implementations execute a program in two phases, first compiling the source code into bytecode, and then passing the bytecode to the virtual machine. There are bytecode based virtual machines of this sort for Java, Raku, Python, PHP, Tcl, mawk and Forth (however, Forth is seldom compiled via bytecodes in this way, and its virtual machine is more generic instead). The implementation of Perl and Ruby 1.8 instead work by walking an abstract syntax tree representation derived from the source code.

More recently, the authors of V8 and Dart have challenged the notion that intermediate bytecode is needed for fast and efficient VM implementation. Both of these language implementations currently do direct JIT compiling from source code to machine code with no bytecode intermediary.

Palau de les Belles Arts

The Palau de les Belles Arts was a multipurpose building in Barcelona . Demolished in 1942, it was built on the occasion of the universal exhibition of 1888, in the space where the municipal courts are currently in front of the Parc de la Ciutadella, on the corner of "Passeig de Lluís Companys" and "Passeig de Pujades" .

Work of August Font i Carreras, it was destined to artistic exhibitions, concerts and cultural events. The building had a rectangular floor plan and was 91 x 50 meters. The iron structure allowed to cover a great assembly hall. It had exposed side towers, with domes at the corners. On the second floor, there were different rooms, around the large one, with zenithal light, which allowed events and exhibitions to take place.

The building basically consisted of a large hall, the Queen Regent's Hall, with an area of 2,000 square meters, intended for public events.

This building was the first headquarters of the Municipal Museum of Fine Arts of Barcelona, between 1891 and 1915, where the different municipal and later provincial art collections met, a collection that years later became part of the Museum. National Art of Catalonia . During the Universal Exhibition, an exhibition of works of art from municipal collections and other collections from all over Spain was exhibited. Afterwards, exhibitions of fine arts and artistic industries took place ( General Exhibition of Fine Arts of Barcelona ). The periodic holding of these shows necessitated the temporary relocation of funds to other places. In 1917 the Exposition d'Art Français was organized in solidarity with French artists.

In 1921 the works belonging to the Municipal Museums of Arts of Barcelona were incorporated.



Japanese Spitz

The is a small to medium breed of dog, mainly used as a companion dog (although they can be used as a watchdog). Standards (requirements) usually vary across the world for these dogs. Developed in Japan during the 1920s and 30s, they were bred by breeding some Spitz type dog breeds. The breed is recognized by most kennel clubs except the AKC. It is a new breed, however it is growing in popularity due to their good temperament (behaviour). 

These dogs are known for being smart, easy to train, and good with children. They can be protective of their owner(s), hence why they can be good watchdogs. They can bark if people they do not know enter their territory.

Lactic acid fermentation

Lactic acid fermentation is how glucose or other monosaccharide sugars are converted into lactic acid and energy. There may also be other by-products of this fermentation. It also works with other sugars, such as sucrose or lactose. Lactic acid bacteria use fermentation to get energy. Fungi, plants and animals will also use this it, if there is a lack of oxygen. As an example, it occurs in muscle cells. With humans, it occurs if there's too little oxygen in the blood, known as Hypoxemia.

There are different types of lactic acid fermentation:


Lactic acid fermentation is a way to preserve food, and make it last longer. It has been in use at least since the Paleolithic era. Fermentation will reduce the activity of the bacteria that make food go bad; it will also kill some of them. Examples are fermented milk products, such as yoghurt, sauerkraut, kimchi, and tsukemono.

During the 19th century, several of the fundamental concepts of organic chemistry were discovered. Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac was interested in fermentation processes. One of his students was Justus von Liebig. Both independently described the chemical structure of the lactic acid molecule. Both were chemists, they were only interested in the chemical properties, and how to optimize it using chemical catalyzers. The French chemist Louis Pasteur was the first to describe lactic acid as a product of a microbial fermentation, in 1857. At the time he worked at the University of Lille. A local brewery asked him about some problems they had with fermentation. By chance he discovered that in this brewery, two fermentation processes were taking place: One was the lactic acid fermentation he had expected, the other was an alcoholic fermentation. Both were started by microorganisms.

In the 19th century, several chemists discovered some fundamental concepts of the domain of organic chemistry. One of them was the French chemist Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, who was especially interested in fermentation processes. He also passed this fascination to one of his best students, Justus von Liebig. With a difference of some years, each of them described the chemical structure of the lactic acid molecule as we know it today. Both Gay-Lussac and von Liebig had a purely chemical understanding of the fermentation process: in their view, the process can be optimized with chemical catalyzers; neither of them was interested in seeing it with a microscope. In 1857, the French chemist Louis Pasteur first described lactic acid as the product of a microbial fermentation. During this time, he worked at the university of Lille, where a local distillery asked him for advice concerning some fermentation problems. Per chance and with the badly equipped laboratory he had at that time, he discovered that in this distillery, two fermentations were taking place, a lactic acid one and an alcoholic one, both induced by microorganisms. He then continued the research on these discoveries in Paris, where he also published his theories which contradicted the purely chemical version represented by Liebig and his followers. Even though Pasteur described some concepts that are still accepted today, Liebig refused to accept them. But even Pasteur himself wrote that he was "driven" to a completely new understanding of this chemical phenomenon. Even if Pasteur didn't find every detail of this process, he still discovered the main mechanism of how the microbial lactic acid fermentation works. He was the first to describe fermentation as a "form of life without air."

People had been using microbial lactic acid fermentation to produce food long before Pasteur had described it. Archeological finds show that the fermentation of milk has a long history. Its first uses may have been part of the Neolithic Revolution. Milk contains lactic acid bacteria. Given the right temperature, the fermentation process will happen spontaneously. These first farmers likely had another problem: When people become adults most lose the ability to digest fresh milk. These farmers had an interest to make milk digestible by adults. Lactic acid bacteria contain the enzymes needed to digest lactose. During lactic acid fermentation, the number of lactic acid bacteria increase. So even if fermentation only happens for a short time, the product will contain enough enzymes, which allows the milk to be digested by adults. Even safer was a longer fermentation, which was practiced for cheesemaking. This process was also discovered a very long time ago, which is proven by recipes for cheese production on Cuneiform scripts, the first written documents that exist, and a bit later in Babylonian and Egyptian texts.
What is interesting is the theory of the competitive advantage of fermented milk products. The idea of this theory is that the women of these first settled farmer clans could shorten the time between two children thanks to the additional lactose uptake from milk consumption. This factor may have given them an important advantage to out-compete the hunter-gatherer societies.

Since they consumed more milk products, these societies developed lactase pesistence: The milk-digesting enzyme lactase was present in their body during the whole lifetime: They could also drink unfermented milk as adults. Even today there are regional differences: Estimates are that about 65% of the world polulation still lacks this enzyme. The first societies came from regions in eastern Turkey to central Europe; the gene is more common there, as well as in the United States, which was settled from Europe. In Asian countries, lactose intolerance is much more present.

Milk products and their fermentation have had an important influence on some cultures’ development. This is the case in Mongolia, where people often practice a pastoral form of agriculture. The milk that they produce and consume in these cultures is mainly mare milk and has a long tradition. But not every part or product of the fresh milk has the same meaning. The fattier part on the top, the "deež", is seen as the most valuable part and is therefore often used to honor guests.
Very important with often a traditional meaning as well are fermentation products of mare milk, like for example the slightly-alcoholic yogurt kumis. Consumption of these peaks during cultural festivities such as the Mongolian lunar new year (in spring). The time of this celebration is called the "white month", which indicates that milk products (called "white food" together with starchy vegetables, in comparison to meat products, called "black food") are a central part of this tradition. The purpose of these festivities is to "close" the past year – clean the house or the yurt, honor the animals for having provided their food, and prepare everything for the coming summer season – to be ready to "open" the new year. Consuming white food in this festive context is a way to connect to the past and to a national identity, which is the great Mongolian empire personified by Genghis Khan. During the time of this empire, the fermented mare milk was the drink to honor and thank warriors and leading persons, it was not meant for everybody. Although it eventually became a drink for normal people, it has kept its honorable meaning. Like many other traditions, this one feels the influence of globalization. Other products, like industrial yogurt, coming mainly from China and western countries, have tended to replace it more and more, mainly in urban areas. However, in rural and poorer regions it is still of great importance.

Some major bacterial strains identified as being able to ferment lactose are in the genera "Escherichia, Citrobacter, Enterobacter" and "Klebsiella ." All four of these groups fall underneath the family of "Enterobacteriaceae." These four species are able to be separated from each other by using biochemical testing. To distinguish between the species, simple biological tests are readily available. Apart from whole sequence genomics, common tests include H2S production, motility and citrate use, indol, methyl red and Voges-Proskauer tests.

Lactic acid fermentation is used in many areas of the world to produce foods that cannot be produced through other methods. The most commercially important genus of lactic acid-fermenting bacteria is "Lactobacillus", though other bacteria and even yeast are sometimes used. Two of the most common applications of lactic acid fermentation are in the production of yogurt and sauerkraut.

Lactic acid fermentation is used in the production of sauerkraut. The main type of bacteria used in the production of sauerkraut is of the genus "Leuconostoc".

As in yogurt, when the acidity rises due to lactic acid-fermenting organisms, many other pathogenic microorganisms are killed. The bacteria produce lactic acid, as well as simple alcohols and other hydrocarbons. These may then combine to form esters, contributing to the unique flavor of sauerkraut.

Lactic acid is a component in the production of sour beers, including Lambics and Berliner Weisses.

The main method of producing yogurt is through the lactic acid fermentation of milk with harmless bacteria. Most often, the bacteria used are "Lactobacillus bulgaricus" and "Streptococcus thermophilus", and United States as well as European law requires all yogurts to contain these two cultures (though others may be added as probiotic cultures). These bacteria produce lactic acid in the milk culture, decreasing its pH and causing it to congeal. The bacteria also produce compounds that give yogurt its distinctive flavor. An additional effect of the lowered pH is the incompatibility of the acidic environment with many other types of harmful bacteria.

For a probiotic yogurt, additional types of bacteria such as "Lactobacillus acidophilus" are also added to the culture.

Lyric poetry is popular in Latin America. Some lines in lyric poems rhyme. Sometimes lyric poems do not rhyme. Rubén Darío, César Vallejo, Ernesto Cardenal, Gabriela Mistral, and Pablo Neruda wrote lyric poems.

Prose poetry is also popular in Latin America. Prose poems are written in sentences and paragraphs. (The lines do not rhyme.) Jorge Luis Borges ("Everything and Nothing"), Pablo Neruda ("Passions and Impressions)", Octavio Paz ("Eagle or Sun?"), Alejandra Pizarnik ("Sex/Nigh"t), and Giannina Braschi ("Empire of Dreams") wrote prose poetry.

Latin American poets also have a strong tradition of epic poetry. National themes, landscapes, and local traditions appear in epic poems. José Hernández wrote the famous epic poem "Martín Fierro" about cowboy culture in Argentina.

In the 17th century, Sor Juana was a nun who lived in Mexico. She wrote spiritual and philosophical poems. 

In the 19th century, the Cuban poet José Martí wrote the famous poem, "Yo soy un hombre sincero" ("I'm a sincere man"). This poem became the lyrics of the popular song "Guantanamera". Rubén Darío was a famous modernist poet. He wrote "Azul" (1888). Cesar Vallejo is one of the most important poets in the Spanish Language. Vallejo wrote "Trilce ("1922). 

In the 20th century, Gabriela Mistral was the first Latin American poet to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. She wrote about children, teachers, family, and romance. Pablo Neruda wrote the epic poem "Canto General". Neruda was the second Latin American poet won the Nobel Prize. Alejandra Pizarnik wore prose poems about childhood, cruelty, and death. Giannina Braschi writes epic poetry about immigration, revolution, and freedom. Ana Castillo writes about the Mexican border, ghosts, and Chicano culture. Roberto Bolaño wrote novels about poets. His famous novels "2666 and Savage Detectives." Bolaño also wrote many poems in free verse and in prose.

Puss in Boots (Shrek)

Puss in Boots is a main character in the "Shrek" franchise, also being portrayed as the title character and protagonist of the movie "Puss in Boots" (2011). He made his first appearance in the movie "Shrek 2" (2004), soon becoming Shrek's partner and helper (alongside Donkey). In the movie "Shrek the Third" (2007), Puss helps Shrek find the heir to the throne of the Far Far Away Kingdom. The movie "Shrek Forever After" (2010) is primarily set in an alternate universe, where Puss is Princess Fiona's pet and has gained weight after his retirement. In the spin-off and prequel "Puss in Boots", his origins are described. Puss also appears in the Netflix television series centered on him, "The Adventures of Puss in Boots" (2015–2018).

Puss was inspired by the title character of the fairy tale "Puss in Boots". His design, created by Tom Hester, was based on real cats. Several characters were used as inspirations for Puss's characterization, such as Zorro and Indiana Jones. The idea of Puss as the protagonist of a film was explored after his debut appearance. Antonio Banderas voices Puss in the English, Spanish, and Italian dubs of the "Shrek" franchise. While he initially tried a high-pitched voice for the character, he and the "Shrek 2" filmmakers decided on a tone that was deeper than his normal voice. Banderas said that voicing Puss was an important part of his career. Eric Bauza provides Puss's voice in "The Adventures of Puss in Boots".

The character is well liked, with critics praising his depiction and considering him a source of comic relief. Reviewers have regarded Puss as a popular "Shrek" character. Banderas's voice acting has also been praised. Merchandise inspired by the character has been produced.

Puss in Boots is inspired by the title character of the fairy tale with the same name.

Antonio Banderas voiced Puss in the "Shrek" franchise. Banderas said that his initial motivation to voice Puss was that he enjoyed the movie "Shrek" (2001). According to the actor, he was chosen for the role of Puss because of his Spanish accent.

Critical reception of Puss has been well liked, with reviewers praising him in the movies and describing him as "cute", "suave", "lovable", "charismatic", "feisty", "engaging", "legendary", "an instant charmer", "a natural-born star", "a notorious adventurer", the "suavest of swashbuckling cats", and "the world's greatest feline swordfighter". He was also regarded as "smooth-talking", "heroic", "honorable", self-confident, "passionate", loyal, with "humble" origins. "Collider"s Christina Radish described Puss as "charming and unforgettable", adding that he "was a cat destined for great things". Radish said that Puss getting his own movie was no surprise, commenting that the character has a "tremendous heart", and is a "much-loved fighter". "Fantasy Magazine"s Andrew Penn Romine called Puss "equal parts rogue and hero", but Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" described the character as "this vain, spoiled, swashbuckler". According to Holden, Puss is not "as clear-cut a personality [in "Puss in Boots"] as he was" in the "Shrek" movies. "IndieLondon"s Rob Carnevale called him a "cheeky feline swashbuckler" and "Puss in Boots"s "enigmatic central character". Todd McCarthy of "The Hollywood Reporter" described Puss as a "dashing little kitty centerstage", "ever-bold", and "a self-deprecating, sometimes bumbling but ultimately dashing swordsman". McCarthy enjoyed Puss's "vigorous physicality" in "Puss in Boots". Neil Genzlinger of "The New York Times" called Puss "endearing", "dashing and fearless but also a tad reckless". Chrissy Iley of "The Telegraph" described him as "the world's most seductive animated cat". "IGN"s Andy Patrizio enjoyed Puss in "Shrek 2", and Scott Collura of the same website said that Puss "remains dignified and cool" in "Shrek Forever After" despite his weight gain. The character has been regarded as a source of comic relief.

Hellboy

Hellboy is a fictional superhero created by writer-artist Mike Mignola. The character first appeared in "San Diego Comic-Con Comics" #2 (August 1993), and has since appeared in various eponymous miniseries, one-shots and intercompany crossovers. The character has been adapted into three live-action feature movies. Two starring Ron Perlman in 2004 and in the title role, and one in 2019 which starred David Harbour, as well as two straight-to-DVD animated movies, and three video games – "", "", and as a playable character in "Injustice 2".

A well-meaning half-Demon (or Cambion) whose true name is Anung Un Rama ("and upon his brow is set a crown of flame"), Hellboy was summoned from Hell to Earth as a baby by Nazi occultists (spawning his hatred for the Third Reich). He was discovered on a fictional Outer Hebrides Island by the Allied Forces; amongst them, Professor Trevor Bruttenholm, who formed the United States Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (B.P.R.D.). In time, Hellboy grew to be a large, red-skinned adult with a tail, horns (which he files off, leaving behind circular stumps on his forehead), cloven hooves for feet, and an oversized right hand made of stone (the "Right Hand of Doom"). He has been described as smelling of dry-roasted peanuts.

Hellboy works for the B.P.R.D., an international non-governmental agency, and for himself against dark forces including Nazis and witches, in a series of tales that have their roots in folklore, pulp magazines, vintage adventure, Lovecraftian horror and horror fiction. In earlier stories, he is identified as the "World's Greatest Paranormal Investigator".

In 2011, Hellboy was ranked 25th of the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes by IGN.

Litoria humboldtorum

Litoria humboldtorum is a frog from Indonesia. It lives near the Foya Mountains. Scientists saw it between 500 and 1050 meters above sea level.

Tridevi

Tridevi refers to three supreme goddesses, wifes of tridev - "Lakshmi" (wife of Visnhu), "Saraswati" (wife of Brahma), "Parvati/ Kali" (wife of Shiva).

Saraswati is the goddess of learning and arts, cultural fulfillment. She is the cosmic intelligence, cosmic consciousness, and cosmic knowledge.

Lakshmi is the goddess of wealth and fertility, material fulfillment. However, she does not signify mere material wealth like gold, cattle, etc. All kinds of prosperity, glory, magnificence, joy, exaltation, or greatness come under Lakshmi.

Parvati/ Mahakali the goddess of power and love, spiritual fulfillment. She also depicts the transformational power of divinity, the power that dissolves multiplicity in unity.

Ethanol fermentation

Ethanol fermentation is a fermentation process that converts sugar into cellular energy, producing ethanol, and carbon dioxide. Because ethanol is an alcohol, it is also known as alcoholic fermentation. Yeast will do this without using oxygen, the process is anaerobic. It also happens in some kind of fish, where it produces energy, when there is little oxygen. 

Ethanol fermentation has many uses, including the production of alcoholic drinks (such as beer or wine), the production of ethanol fuel, and the cooking of bread.

Flames of Passion

Hyperbolic functions

In mathematics, hyperbolic functions are analogues of the ordinary trigonometric functions, but defined for the unit hyperbola rather than on the unit circle: just as the points form a circle with a unit radius, the points form the right half of the hyperbola.

Hyperbolic functions occur in the calculations of angles and distances in hyperbolic geometry. They also occur in the solutions of many linear differential equations, cubic equations, and Laplace's equation in Cartesian coordinates. Laplace's equations are important in many areas of physics.

The basic hyperbolic functions are:
from which are derived:
corresponding to the derived trigonometric functions.

The inverse hyperbolic functions are:

The hyperbolic functions take a real argument called a hyperbolic angle. The size of a hyperbolic angle is twice the area of its hyperbolic sector. The hyperbolic functions may be defined in terms of the legs of a right triangle covering this sector.

Hyperbolic functions were introduced in the 1760s independently by Vincenzo Riccati and Johann Heinrich Lambert.

There are various equivalent ways to define the hyperbolic functions.

In terms of the exponential function:


The hyperbolic functions satisfy many identities, all of them similar in form to the trigonometric identities. 

Odd and even functions:

Hence:

Thus, and are even functions; the others are odd functions.

Hyperbolic sine and cosine satisfy: 

the last of which is similar to the Pythagorean trigonometric identity.

One also has

for the other functions.

The hyperbolic functions represent an expansion of trigonometry beyond the functions defined on unit circle. Both types depend on one argument, either circular angle or hyperbolic angle.

Since the area of a circular sector with radius "r" and angle "u" (in radians) is "r""u"/2, it will be equal to "u" when "r" = . In the diagram, such a circle is tangent to the hyperbola "xy" = 1 at (1,1). The yellow sector depicts an area and angle magnitude. Similarly, the yellow and red sectors together depict an area and hyperbolic angle magnitude.

The legs of the two right triangles with hypotenuse on the ray defining the angles are of length formula_12 times the circular and hyperbolic functions.

The decomposition of the exponential function in its even and odd parts gives the identities
and
The first one is analogous to Euler's formula

RGB color model

The RGB color model is an additive color model. In this model red, green and blue are added together to form a new color.

An RGB color can be made by shining three colored lights of red, green, and blue onto a white wall in a dark room. Each light has a dimmer (to regulate its intensity.)

If only the red light is on, the wall will be red. If only the green light is on, the wall will look green. If the red and green lights are on together, the wall will look yellow. Dim the red light and the wall will become more of a yellow-green.

Each setting of the three dimmers will produce a different result, either in color or in brightness or both. The set of all possible results is the gamut. Swap the red lamp for one of a different brand that is slightly more orange, and there will be a slightly different gamut, since the set of all colors that can be produced with the three lights will be changed.

The name of the model comes from the initials of the three primary colors, red, green, and blue.

The purpose of the RGB color model is for capturing, storing, and displaying images in digital electronic devices, such as photo cameras, television sets, video cameras and computers. Before the electronic age, the RGB color model already had a solid theory behind it, based in human perception of colors.

The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green, and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad set of colors. The three light beams are added together, and their light spectra add to make the final color's spectrum. Zero intensity for each component gives the darkest color (no light, considered the "black"), and full intensity of each gives a white. 
This is in stark contrast to physical paints, such as oil paint, which create black when mixed.

The additive color model is opposite to the subtractive color model, particularly the CMY color model.

The RGB color model is based on the Young–Helmholtz theory of trichromatic color vision, developed by Thomas Young and Hermann von Helmholtz in the early to mid-nineteenth century, and on James Clerk Maxwell's color triangle that elaborated that theory (circa 1860).

The first experiments with RGB in early color photography were made in 1861 by Maxwell himself, and involved the process of combining three color-filtered separate picture takes. To reproduce the color photograph, three matching projections over a screen in a dark room were necessary.

The modern RGB technology for color CRT displays was patented by Werner Flechsig in Germany in 1938.

A color in the RGB color model is recorded by indicating how much of each of the red, green, and blue is included. The color is expressed as an RGB triplet ("r","g","b"), each component of which can vary from zero to a defined maximum value. If all the components are at zero the result is black; if all are at maximum, the result is the brightest representable white.

These ranges may be quantified in several different ways:


For example, brightest saturated red is written in the different RGB notations as:

Color model

A color model is a mathematical model describing the way to represent colors as numbers, usually as three or four values. These values are called color components or color channels. When the model is linked to a description of how to interpret the components (viewing conditions, etc.), the resulting set of colors is called "color space."

The color models can be additive or subtractive. Additive and subtractive color models are opposite.

In additive color models, such as RGB, white is the combination of all primary-colored lights, and black is the absence of any light. Other colors are a mix of different strength of primary colors.

Subtractive color models "subtract" or mask colors from white background of the paper. The ink reduces the reflected white light. White light minus red leaves cyan, white light minus green leaves magenta, and white light minus blue leaves yellow. Such color models are used in printing. An example of such a model is CMYK color model.

Media that emit light (such as television) use color mixing with primary colors of red, green, and blue, each of which stimulates one of the three types of the eye's color receptors. This is called "RGB" color model. Mixtures of light of these primary colors cover a large part of the human color space.

RYB (an abbreviation of red–yellow–blue) is an additive color model that uses red, yellow, and blue pigments as primary colors in art and applied design. The RYB color model underpinned the color curriculum of the Bauhaus.

It is possible to achieve a large range of colors seen by humans by putting cyan, magenta, and yellow transparent dyes/inks on a white background. These are the "subtractive" primary colors. Often a fourth ink, black, is added to improve reproduction of some dark colors. This is called the "CMY" or "CMYK" color model.

The cyan ink absorbs red light but transmits green and blue, the magenta ink absorbs green light but transmits red and blue, and the yellow ink absorbs blue light but transmits red and green. The white substrate reflects the transmitted light back to the viewer.

A number of color models exist in which colors are fitted into conic, cylindrical or spherical shapes, with neutral (gray) colors running from black to white along a central axis, and hues (tints) corresponding to angles around the perimeter. Models of this type date back to the 18th century, and continue to be developed in the most modern models.

Different color theorists have designed unique color 3D shapes. Many are in the shape of a sphere. The color spheres invented by Phillip Otto Runge and Johannes Itten are typical examples and prototypes for many other color solid schematics.

HSL and HSV are both cylindrical, with hue, their angular dimension, starting at the red primary color at 0°, passing through the green primary at 120° and the blue primary at 240°, and then going back to red at 360°. In each, the central vertical axis comprises the "neutral", "achromatic", or "gray" colors, ranging from black at lightness 0 or value 0, the bottom, to white at lightness 1 or value 1, the top.

In an attempt to create an intuitive color mixing model, computer graphics pioneers at PARC and NYIT developed the HSV model in the mid-1970s. It was formally described by Alvy Ray Smith in the August 1978 issue of "Computer Graphics". In the same issue, Joblove and Greenberg described the HSL model—whose dimensions they labeled "hue", "relative chroma", and "intensity"—and compared it to HSV.

These models were useful not only because they were more intuitive than raw RGB values, but also because the conversions to and from RGB were extremely fast to compute: they could run in real time on the hardware of the 1970s. Consequently, these models and similar ones have been used in image editing and graphics software since then.

Another influential older cylindrical color model is the early-20th-century Munsell color model. Albert Munsell began with a spherical model in his 1905 book "A Color Notation", but he wished to separate color-making attributes into separate dimensions, which he called "hue", "value", and "chroma. A"fter taking careful measurements of human perception, he realized that no symmetrical shape would fit. So he reorganized his system into a blob.

Munsell's system became extremely popular. The de facto reference for American color standards—used not only for specifying the color of paints and crayons, but also electrical wire, beer, and soil color—because it was organized on human perception measurements. It specified colors in an easily learned and systematic triple of numbers. The color chips sold in the "Munsell Book of Color" covered a wide gamut and remained stable over time (rather than fading). The trouble with the Munsell system for computer graphics applications is that its colors are not specified via any set of simple equations, but only by its measurements: effectively a lookup table.

The Swedish Natural Color System, widely used in Europe, takes a similar approach to the Ostwald bi-cone. Because it attempts to fit color into a familiar shape based on "phenomenological" instead of photometric or psychological characteristics, it suffers from some of the same drawbacks as HSL and HSV: in particular, its lightness dimension differs from perceived lightness, because it forces colorful yellow, red, green, and blue into a plane.

Murder of Samuel Paty

The murder of Samuel Paty was a terrorist attack that took place on 16 October 2020 in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, near Paris. Paty was a French secondary school teacher, and he was killed and then beheaded by an Islamist terrorist, Abdoullakh Abouyedovich Anzorov. Anzorov killed Paty after a "hate campaign" on social media. A student at the school where Paty taught lied about Paty's teaching, and the student's father started the hate campaign.

Paty showed his students "Charlie Hebdo"'s 2012 cartoons showing Muhammad in a class on freedom of speech. A girl who was not in the class lied about what the teacher taught, and her father made a complaint to the police. He also started the internet "hate campaign" against Paty that caused Anzorov to kill Paty. The murder happened during the trial of other terrorists who were part of the "Charlie Hebdo" shooting in 2015.

The killers in the 2015 shooting were against "Charlie Hebdo"'s 2012 cartoons showing Muhammad. After Paty showed these cartoons in a class about freedom of speech, an Islamist imam wrote a "fatwa" ("an opinion on Muslim law") against Paty which called for his punishment. Anzorov killed Paty and put a picture of his head on Twitter. Many of Paty's students saw the picture. Anzorov said that he had "executed" Paty and addressed his words and the picture of Paty's head to Emmanuel Macron, the president of the French Republic. The police shot Anzorov dead a few minutes after the murder.

President Macron said that the event was "a typical Islamist terrorist attack", and that "our compatriot was killed for teaching children freedom of speech".

On 6 October, Samuel Paty was teaching a lesson on dilemmas. The lesson was about the magazine "Charlie Hebdo"'s cartoons of Muhammad and the 2015 "Charlie Hebdo" shooting. (In January 2015, Islamist terrorists attacked the office of the magazine and killed 12 people.) Paty showed the class of 13- and 14-year-olds the cartoons but said that Muslim students, who might be shocked, could close their eyes or leave the room if they wanted.

A 13-year-old girl at Paty's school was often truant and failed to go to her lessons. Because of her absences, the school suspended the girl. She did not want her father, Brahim Chnina, to know about her bad behaviour. On 8 October the girl lied to her father that Paty had ordered Muslim students in his lesson on 6 October to leave the room. She said the teacher then showed the other students "a photograph of the Prophet naked". She said that Paty sent her home for two days because she disagreed with him. The girl was not in the lesson.

Brahim Chnina, the girl's father, was 48 years old and was born in Morocco. When his daughter told him her story, Chnina made an angry video which he put on Facebook. In the video, he demanded that the school fire Paty from his job. Chnina made another angry video in which he accused Paty of "discrimination". Chnina made complaints to the school and to the police. He said Paty was "diffusing a pornographic image". Chnina said that Paty had ordered Muslim students to lift their hands and then leave the room while Paty showed the class the image. Chnina also said there was Islamophobia at the school. He said that other parents should help him force the school to fire Paty. He sent these videos to the organization Collective Against Islamophobia in France () and to his local mosque. Chnina said the same things on radio as well.

Gamut

In computer graphics and photography, the gamut, or color gamut , is a certain "subset" of colors. Most often it is a subset of colors, which can be accurately represented by some output device.

Another sense refers to the complete set of colors found within an image. 

The term "gamut" was adopted from music, where in middle age Latin "gamut" meant the entire range of musical notes of which musical melodies are composed. In the 1850s, the term was used for a range of colors or hue, for example by Thomas De Quincey, who wrote "Porphyry, I have heard, runs through as large a gamut of hues as marble."

In color theory, the gamut of a device is the portion of the color space that it can show.

When certain colors cannot be presented within a particular color model, those colors are said to be "out of gamut". 

While processing a digital image, an image is usually recorded in RGB color model. When printing such image has to be converted from an original RGB color space to the printer's CMYK color space. During this process, the colors, which are out of printer's gamut are converted to the in-gamut colors. So, the final image is an approximation of the original one. 

Gamuts are commonly represented as areas in the full visible range of colors. The full range of colors is usually shown as CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram shaped like a horseshoe.

The gamut depends on the brightness. So a full gamut is represented in 3D space.

The list contains some typical devices, wich show pictures, ranging from large to small color gamut:

Cross-site scripting

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a client-side code injection attack. The attacker aims to execute malicious scripts in a web browser of the victim by including malicious code. 
In a Cross-site Scripting attack (XSS), the attacker uses your vulnerable web page to deliver malicious JavaScript to your user. The user's browser executes this malicious JavaScript on the user's Computer. Note that about one in three websites is vulnerable to Cross-site scripting.
Non-persistent XSS vulnerabilities in Google could allow sites to attack Google users who visit them while logged in.
The persistent XSS vulnerability is a more devastating variant of a cross-site scripting flaw: it occurs when the data provided by the attacker is saved by the server, and then permanently displayed on "normal" pages returned to other users in the course of regular browsing, without proper HTML escaping.
Self-XSS is a form of XSS vulnerability which relies on social engineering in order to trick the victim into executing malicious JavaScript code into their browser.
Mutated XSS happens when the attacker injects something that is seemingly safe, but rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. This makes it extremely hard to detect or sanitize within the websites application logic.

List of incidents of xenophobia and racism related to the COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic started in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. It has led to increased acts of prejudice, xenophobia, discrimination, racism and violence against people of Southeast Asian, Hispanic, East Asian, Native American, biracial and black people all over the world. With the spread of the pandemic and in formation of hotspots, like those in Asia, Europe and the Americas, discrimination against people from these hotspots was reported.

According to the Embassy of Japan in Cairo, store clerks were hesitating to serve Japanese customers. "Corona" became a new slur by which to abuse Japanese people on the street.

On 10 March 2020, an Uber driver was arrested when a viral video forcibly removing a Chinese passenger in Cairo's Maadi district. The passenger was thought to have the coronavirus. The incident caused an uproar among Egyptians when the video was uploaded. Some Egyptians visited the Chinese man in his hotel room.

Violence toward foreign people was reported during the pandemic. Some local people attacked foreign people. The attackers published a number of photos of them under social media and linked them to the Covid-19.

A video reportedly recorded in Kibera, Kenya showed an angry crowd threatening a man and woman of East Asian descent about the coronavirus. A man in the crowd shouted at the couple, "You are corona!" In the crowd, a motorcycle rider raised his hand and threatened slapping the Asian man. The couple looked angry. They began swearing toward the crowd before the video ended.

There have been instances of Wuhan natives in other provinces being turned away from hotels. Their ID numbers, home addresses and telephone numbers were deliberately leaked online. They also dealt with harassing phone calls from strangers. Many hotels or guesthouses declined people who had addresses in Wuhan. A number of hotels refused to check-in a Wuhan tour guide. She returned to Hangzhou from Singapore. One of the hotels called police to give her a health check. They then asked the police to quarantine her.

Over 100 restaurants in Hong Kong turned away customers from mainland China. One restaurant demanded that a customer produce a Hong Kong identity card to prove they weren't from the mainland.

Over 760,000 South Korean citizens signed a petition wanting the government to ban foreign tourists from entering this country. No Chinese signs have been popping up. Some businesses banned all foreigners.

There were reports of Asian people of increased racism in Belgium due to the pandemic.

Non-Western restaurants, including Chinese, Thai, Japanese and Cambodian reported not as many customers coming. The scale of the decline ranged from 30% to 50%. South Korean mass media reported an increased animosity toward South Korean nationals.

Asians in Paris reported harassment and racism.

Racism, violence and discrimination were committed against mixed race, biracial, Southeast Asian and East Asian people in Canada.

In the United States, 58% of Asian Americans and 45% of African Americans believed that racist views toward them had been committed since the pandemic. That's according to a Pew Research study.

Gold leaf is gold that has been hammered into thin sheets by goldbeating. It is often used for gilding. The most commonly used gold is 22-karat yellow gold. Layering gold leaf over a surface is called gold leafing or gilding.

Gold leaf is sometimes used in art without a gilding process. In many cultures, it was used to wrap objects such as bullae. It has been used in jewellery.

Gold leaf has traditionally been used as a gilding material to decorate art or the picture frames. Gold leaf paintings were used in mosaics in later Early Christian art. Gold leaf is also used in Buddhist art to decorate statues and symbols. Gold leafing can also be seen on domes in religious and public architecture.

Gold leaf has long been used in architecture. It was used in Byzantine and Roman churches and basilicas in 400 AD.

As a result, Central Board of Film Certification refused approval for censorship. On 16 October 2017, the film received a U/A certificate from CBFC, with few cuts after receiving NoC from AWBI.

"Mersal" received positive reviews from critics. The Times of India gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and said "With Mersal, we have got this year's most engaging mass masala movie. When you have a mass hero in full form like Vijay is in the film, how can things go wrong?". The Indian Express also gave 3.5 out of 5 stars and said "Atlee has not just exploited Vijay's stardom to deliver a flamboyant crowd-pleaser (which he did in Theri already) but has fleshed out an interesting script that plays up the best onscreen traits of the actor".

A. R. Rahman composed the soundtrack album and background score of "Mersal", teaming up with Vijay for the third time, after his films "Udhaya"(2004), and "Azhagiya Tamizh Magan" (2007), and his first collaboration with Atlee.

C dynamic memory allocation

In the C programming language, dynamic memory allocation refers to allocating memory during a program's run time. Dynamically allocated memory is obtained from a storage pool called a heap. A group of functions in the C standard library are typically used for dynamic memory allocation.

C dynamic memory allocation functions are defined in "stdlib.h" header.


The C language does not by default check that the calls to these functions, or the accesses to the arrays they create, are used correctly. If the program does something invalid, such as accessing memory beyond what has been allocated, or using memory that has been freed, this can cause the program to crash or to behave in some other undesirable way. In some cases, improper use of these functions can create security vulnerabilities that allow hackers to read or modify sensitive data or run malicious code.

int *array = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
free(array);

CMYK color model

The CMYK color model is a subtractive color model, based on the CMY color model, used in color printing. CMYK refers to the four inks used in printing: cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black).

The CMYK model is subtractive. It means that it "subtracts" or masks colors from white background of the paper. The ink reduces the reflected light. White light minus red leaves cyan, white light minus green leaves magenta, and white light minus blue leaves yellow.

White is the natural color of the paper, while black results from a full combination of colored inks. To save cost on ink, and to produce deeper black tones, unsaturated and dark colors are produced by using black ink instead of pure mix of cyan, magenta, and yellow.

The "black" produced by mixing usual cyan, magenta, and yellow inks is actually a dark grey color. So, modern four-color printing uses black ink in addition to the subtractive primary colors. Common reasons for using black ink include:

Launch on warning

Launch on warning (LOW) is a strategy of using nuclear weapons that gained recognition during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Launch on warning became an important part of mutually assured destruction (MAD) theory as a result of the invention of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Under the LOW strategy, nuclear weapons are launched as retaliation upon receiving warning signs of an enemy nuclear attack, even while the incoming missiles are still in the air and before detonation occurs. U.S. land-based missiles can reportedly be launched
within five minutes of a presidential decision to do so, and submarine-based missiles can be launched within 15 minutes.

Code talker

A code talker was a person who was hired by the United States military during wartime to use a little-known language as a means of secret communication through codes. The term is now usually known with United States service members during the World Wars who used their knowledge of Native American languages.

About 400 to 500 Native Americans in the United States Marine Corps whose primary job was to transmit secret tactical messages. 

The code talkers improved the speed of encryption and decryption of communications in front line operations during World War II.

Native soldiers developed two types of Native American Code Talking (NACT). First developed by Choctaw in World War I, Type one NACT contained coded vocabulary, collections of words or phrases that were assigned to military subjects, within their languages. Type two NACT simply used existing Native languages. Both forms worked as codes because they were based on languages unknown to the enemy and, as the new codes were not based on mathematical processes as found in most code and cipher systems, the enemy had nothing to which to compare them.

During World War II, Comanche soldiers created about 250 coded terms, while Navajo soldiers eventually developed more than 700 terms. Many terms were based on everyday things in the tribal communities such as animals, food, material items and descriptions. Examples of code terms include the Comanche terms for tank (“wakaree’e” or “turtle”) and telephone exchange (“puhihwi tekwapu kahni” or “metal talking house”); the Hopi terms for ship (“pa-a-ki-hu” or “houses on water”) and the M-1 rifle (mouth and one); and the Navajo term for grenade (“ni-ma-si” or “potatoes”). A 1941 edition of the journal “The Masterkey” reports that one of the tribes in the Chippewa and Oneida group developed terms based on the colors of military hat cords and other insignia, with the Native word for “blue” meaning infantry, “yellow” meaning cavalry and “red” for artillery. The Comanche even had a code name for Adolf Hitler—“Po’sa taiboo’” (Crazy White Man). Hopi, Meskwaki and Canadian Cree also had specially devised code terms, although the number is unknown.

Eight Hopi code talkers were in the 81st Division. Although Frank Chapella, Franklin Shupla and Warren Koopyaquaptewa were all from the village of Tewa, they were both Tewa and Hopi and so spoke both of these tribes’ languages. Frank Chapella’s wife, Elidia Chapella, and his son, Marshall Shupla, recall how these three individuals spoke to one another in Tewa (their matrilineal classification through their mothers) and in Hopi with the other five members of their unit.

Some Type one NACT groups like the Comanche and Navajo also developed alphabet systems, using the first letter of English words translated from Native words to spell out names of individuals and locations. For example, the translation of the Comanche words for pear, ant, rain, ice and snake could be combined to convey “Paris.” While the Comanche used an open system by using any word that translated to the desired letter, the Navajo developed a set vocabulary, such as “wol-la-chee” (ant) for the letter a, “shush” (bear) for b, “moasi” (cat) for c and so on. Later they developed three interchangeable words for each English letter. Both systems prevented repetition and inhibited breaking of the code.

One of the benefits of using these codes derived from Native language was open-air messages could be sent faster, often in one to two minutes compared to existing encryption methods requiring up to four hours to craft, communicate and decode. NACT messages were typically brief—usually less than three lines—to avoid creating radio congestion, drawing enemy attention, providing repetition or giving the enemy more transmissions to analyze. “Whenever we sent a message it was short, sweet and to the point,” Comanche code talker Roderick Red Elk noted.

Because of the speed of their communications, code talkers were especially important in relaying information and conveying orders that needed immediate implementation or response, such as troop movement, enemy resistance, evacuation of wounded and directing artillery, ammunition and other supplies. “It was in these defensive positions where you used it quite a bit,” Comanche code talker Forrest Kassanavoid said. “All critical information, something they felt was really top secret, was in Comanche.”

During 1943 and 1944, U.S. Army, Navy and Marine Corps representatives considered increasing their numbers of American Indian code talkers. However, Army and Navy leaders were skeptical the code talkers’ messages were secure and decided not to expand their units. The Marine Corps expressed optimism but kept silent about its growing program.

CMY color model is a color model, used in color printing. CMY refers to the three inks used in printing: cyan, magenta, and yellow.

The CMY model is subtractive. It means that it "subtracts" or masks colors from white background of the paper. The ink reduces the reflected light. White light minus red leaves cyan, white light minus green leaves magenta, and white light minus blue leaves yellow.

White is the natural color of the paper, while (nearly) black is made by a full combination of colored inks. 

Unlike CMYK color model, it does not use additional black ink. So, it is not such economic and not so good at reproducing dark hues.

Acoustic foam

Acoustic foam is a type of foam used for acoustic treatment. It makes sound waves in the air weaker, thereby reducing their amplitude. It is used to reduce or control noise. Acoustic foams are typically softer and more lightweight than their sound blocking foams. The open and flexible cell structure of acoustic foam acts as a natural soundwave absorber and prevents noises from reverberating off hard surfaces like walls, floors and ceilings. It does this by converting existing sound energy to heat and reducing the ability of soundwaves to bounce back into the room. Depending on how it's used, this type of foam can also enhance the acoustics within a room. Sound absorbing foam cut into pyramid or wedge shapes can be used to manipulate vibrations in a way that improves sound quality.

Acoustic foam can be attached to walls, ceilings, doors, and other places in a room to control noise levels, vibration, and echoes.

Many acoustic foam products are treated with dyes and/or fire retardants.

These twins are Dante and Vergil. Each son has half an amulet given to them by their mother, who herself received them from her husband Sparda.

Dante enters the tower so he could stop Vergil and Arkham and end the demon invasion. On his way to the top, Dante fights many demons and receives new abilities and weapons from them. He also comes across other characters, including Mary, a demon-hunting human girl who wants to kill her father, Arkham, for killing her mother, and Jester, a mysterious clown who helping and attacking Dante at the same time for unknown reasons.

The first time Dante met Vergil on the tower, Vergil defeats Dante, stabs Dante with his own sword, and takes his of the amulet. Unintentionally, Dante's blood unlocks a seal on the sword and awakens his demonic powers.

As Dante chases after Vergil, he meets a large demon named Beowulf, who wants to get revenge on Sparda's betrayal of demons by killing his children. However, Dante blinds him by cutting out his other eye, so Beowulf runs away and looks for Vergil. The second time Dante and Vergil meet, Vergil kills Beowulf and acquires a new weapon to fight Dante with. Before the fight finishes, they are interrupted by Mary and Jester. It turns out that Jester was Arkham the whole time. Arkham then uses the twins' amulet and sheds blood of his own daughter, Mary, the daughter of the priestess, to break Sparda's seal. This transforms the tower and unlocks portal to the demon world. Arkham wishes to go to them demon world to take the Force Edge, Sparda's sword, to take Sparda's power and rule over a demon-infested earth.

After falling off the tower, Dante fights Mary for the right to fight Arkham. After winning the fight, Lady rewards him with her strongest weapon. Dante then climbs to the top of the tower and enters the demon world. Meanwhile, Vergil regains consciousness after passing out from his fall and immediately heads to the top of the tower, completely ignoring Mary on the way.

As Dante catches up to Arkham, Arkham takes the Force Edge. He takes the form of Sparda and then turns into a large blob monster. In the middle of the fight, Vergil joins Dante to defeat Arkham and they both take him out the demon world. After Arkham falls back into the human world, Mary disowns her own name and kills her own father. From then on, she would call herself Lady. This was the nickname Dante would give her because she refused to tell him her name.

After the fight with Arkham, Dante and Vergil have a third and final fight to take the Force Edge and both halves of the amulet. Before Dante wins the fight, the portal to the demon world begins to close. Vergil warns Dante that if he does not leave immediately, they would both be trapped in the demon world forever. Dante refuses to leave until he defeats or kills Vergil, but Vergil chooses to stay in the demon world since the it was once their father's home. Vergil then refuses Dante's help and falls down a waterfall so that Dante would return to the human world without him.

After the portal closes Dante returns to the human world, Dante meets with Lady again and gives her back her weapon. She then sees Dante crying over the loss of his brother. This is how Dante chooses the name for his investigation firm, "Devil May Cry". The two then become demon-hunting partners. While the game's closing credits are rolling on the screen, they fight the all the demons who were still on earth during the demon invasion.

After the closing credits, Dante finally opens his investigation firm with the name "Devil May Cry". In this scene, we see him wearing the same clothes that he will wear in "Devil May Cry", which is set ten years later. Also in this scene, the office is shown decorated with the corpses of the demons Dante has killed throughout the game.

Also after the closing credits, after Vergil falls to the bottom of the waterfall in the demon world, Vergil runs toward his father's old enemy, Mundus. After this, the game ends.

An upgraded version was first released in 2006 and included the ability to play as Vergil and optional boss fights with the Jester.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier

Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a 2014 superhero movie and a sequel to the 2011 movie "". Directed by the Russo brothers, it is the ninth movie of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Two years after the Avengers saved New York City from Loki and the Chitauri, Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) is still trying to adjust to modern life after being frozen in ice for 70 years. He works for the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. with fellow Avenger Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). During a morning run, Steve makes friends with veteran Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie).

Captain America and Black Widow go on a mission to stop pirates from taking control of a S.H.I.E.L.D. ship. As Captain America fights and defeats mercenary Georges Batroc (Georges St-Pierre), Black Widow extracts data from the ship's computers. Steve goes to Fury, angry he wasn't told that Natasha had a different mission than him. Fury tells Steve about Project Insight, a plan by S.H.I.E.L.D. to use satellites and Helicarriers to kill people who they think are threats. Fury tries to decrypt the data Natasha brought him, but when he can't, he asks senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) to delay Project Insight.

Fury is driving around Washington D.C. when he's suddenly attacked by a group of men disguised as officers. Fury uses his modified smart car to fight back and drive away, but is caught off guard when he sees a mysterious man in a black mask, called the Winter Soldier, who is the leader of the attackers. Fury ditches his car and heads to Steve's apartment, where he warns him that S.H.I.E.L.D. is in trouble and gives him a hard drive. The Winter Soldier appears and shoots Fury, apparently killing him. Steve's neighbor "Kate" comes and reveals herself as Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp), a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent assigned by Fury to protect Steve. Steve chases the Winter Soldier and is shocked by the Winter Soldier's enhanced strength.

Pierce asks Steve to tell him what was on the hard drive Fury gave him, but Steve refuses. Angry, Pierce tells S.H.I.E.L.D. that Captain America is an enemy and orders them to hunt him down. Now on the run from S.T.R.I.K.E., Steve meets Natasha and they work together to decode Fury's hard drive. The drive leads them to the army base in New Jersey where Steve was trained in the 1940s. The two of them find a secret bunker with a supercomputer that contains the consciousness of scientist Arnim Zola (Toby Jones), who was thought dead in the 20th century. Zola tells them that he rebuilt the evil organization Hydra from within S.H.I.E.L.D. so they could cause chaos, and that S.H.I.E.L.D. is filled with Hydra double agents who use the Winter Soldier as their main assassin. Steve and Natasha escape the bunker before it's destroyed by a S.H.I.E.L.D. missile. They quickly figure out that Pierce is actually Hydra's leader while pretending to be one of the leaders of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Not knowing who to trust anymore, Steve and Natasha hide in Sam Wilson's house. Sam tells them that he has a "Falcon" wingpack that he used during his time in the military, and they decide to recruit Sam to stop Hydra with them. They kidnap Hydra mole Jasper Sitwell (Maximiliano Hernandez) and force him to tell them Hydra's true plan: to hijack Project Insight by using an algorithm made by Zola to find threats to Hydra, and use the Helicarriers to kill them even before they commit any crimes. The Winter Soldier and his men return and ambush the group, killing Sitwell. After a fight, Steve unmasks the Winter Soldier to reveal James "Bucky" Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Steve's best friend who was thought killed in the 1940s, but was secretly kidnapped by Hydra and brainwashed to follow their orders.

Fury's close friend and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) takes Steve, Sam, and Natasha to a safehouse where Fury is still alive, having faked his death to go undercover. Fury gives them controller chips that they can use to disable the Helicarriers before Hydra can use them. Steve tells Fury that he plans to completely destroy S.H.I.E.L.D. to stop Hydra from ever forming again. They all go to S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, where Steve tells everyone the truth about Hydra and their plan and Natasha leaks Hydra's files to the public. Fury fights and kills Pierce for his betrayal. Meanwhile, Steve and Sam are able to get inside two of the three Helicarriers and disable them with the controller chips. On the third Helicarrier, Bucky appears as the Winter Soldier and tries to stop Steve, but Steve inserts the final controller chip and foils Hydra's plan. Steve refuses to fight Bucky and tries to make him remember that he's his best friend. At first, Bucky resists and attacks Steve, but soon realizes the truth. As Steve falls into the Potomac River, Bucky saves him from drowning and disappears.

After the battle, Hydra is no more and S.H.I.E.L.D. is mostly destroyed. Natasha appears before the Senate, while Fury plans to go to Europe to stop any of Hydra's remaining cells. Steve tells Sam that he wants to find Bucky, and Sam insists on joining him.

In a mid-credits scene, Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (Thomas Kreitschmann) experiments on a test subject with super-speed (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and another with telekinetic abilities (Elizabeth Olsen). In a post-credits scene, Bucky visits his own memorial at the Smithsonian.


Captain America: Civil War

Captain America: Civil War is a 2016 superhero movie directed by the Russo brothers, based on the Marvel Comics character Captain America. The movie is produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to "" (2011) and "" (2014), and the 13th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). 

The movie premiered in Los Angeles on April 12, 2016 and was released in the United States on May 6, as the first movie in Phase Three of the MCU.

In a flashback from 1991, James "Bucky" Barnes/Winter Soldier, a brainwashed soldier with the same strength and power as Captain America, is ordered by the evil organization Hydra to crash a moving car and steal a case that has super-soldier serum. In Lagos, Nigeria in the present, Steve Rogers/Captain America, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, Sam Wilson/Falcon, and Wanda Maximoff are on a mission to stop ex-Hydra agent Brock Rumlow/Crossbones from releasing a deadly bioweapon from a lab. After a fight, Crossbones almost kills Captain America by blowing himself up, but Wanda uses her powers to lift Crossbones and let him explode in the air. The explosion kills Crossbones but also destroys a nearby building, killing a few Wakandan charity workers. Wanda is blamed for the accident, making her feel guilty.

The United States Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross tells the Avengers that the United Nations (UN) wants to pass a law called the Sokovia Accords to control them, because there have been a lot of Avengers-related accidents that have killed innocent people. Ross tells the Avengers that they have to sign the Accords or become criminals, and if they sign it, the Avengers will have to listen to the UN and can't make decisions by themselves anymore. Tony Stark/Iron Man is at the meeting and tells everyone that he supports the Accords because . Steve tells everyone that he doesn't support the Accords because , and he wants the Avengers to make their own decisions. 

While the Avengers fight over the Accords, a Sokovian man named Helmut Zemo finds the Winter Soldier's old Hydra commander and asks him for information on the 1991 mission from the flashback. When the commander doesn't tell him anything, Zemo kills him and steals a red book with commands. The UN holds a conference in Vienna, Austria to pass the Sokovia Accords but a bomb goes off and destroys the building, killing the Wakandan King T'Chaka. Security footage shows that the bomber was the Winter Soldier, and the cops hunt him. Knowing that Bucky was framed by the real bomber, Steve wants to find Bucky before the cops do. Meanwhile, T'Chaka's son, T'Challa, swears to find and kill Bucky in revenge for his father's death.

With Sharon Carter's help, Captain America and Falcon find Bucky living a normal life in Bucharest, Romania. Steve meets Bucky and tries to make him remember that he is his old friend, but Bucky tells him to leave. When the cops show up and attack them, Bucky runs away and Steve and Sam follow him. Black Panther shows up and also chases Bucky, trying to kill him. There is a big chase, which leads to the cops and James Rhodes/War Machine arresting Steve, Bucky, Sam, and Black Panther, who takes off his mask to reveal that he's T'Challa. 

The cops take them to a building, where they imprison Bucky in a cage. Tony tries to convince Steve to sign the Accords but fails. Zemo comes to the building in disguise to "interview" Bucky, but starts reading commands from the red book. Bucky turns into the Winter Soldier, breaking out of his cage and fighting everyone, letting Zemo escape. The Winter Soldier almost escapes, but Steve stops him and sneaks him away with Sam. Ross tells Tony and Natasha that he wants to arrest Steve and his group and gives them 48 hours to bring them back. Natasha asks T'Challa for help, while Tony goes to Queens, New York City to recruit Peter Parker/Spider-Man.

When Bucky wakes up, he tells Steve and Sam that Zemo was the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of a Hydra base in Siberia, where there are more Winter Soldiers like Bucky. Wanting to stop Zemo as soon as possible, Steve violates the Accords and makes a team with Sam, Bucky, Wanda, Scott Lang/Ant-Man, and Clint Barton/Hawkeye. They go to an airport in Berlin, Germany to find a jet, but they are stopped by Iron Man, Spider-Man, Black Panther, Black Widow, Vision, and War Machine. Tony tries to tell Steve to peacefully come with them, but Steve wants to fight instead. The Avengers attack each other, and Steve's team decides to let themselves be arrested so Steve and Bucky can escape in the jet. War Machine tries to follow them, but is accidentally shot down by Vision and can't move his legs anymore. Tony visits Steve's team in an underwater prison called the Raft and asks Sam where Steve and Bucky went, promising to not fight them. Sam tells him, and Tony finds out that Bucky didn't really bomb the UN.

Bucky, Steve, and Tony come to the Hydra facility in Siberia, and Tony says he only wants peace. They find all the other Winter Soldiers dead, and realize that Zemo's the one who did it, and he's already there. Zemo tells them that he wanted to destroy the Avengers because they accidentally killed his family in Sokovia, and plays a clip from the 1991 mission. The clip shows that the people in the car from the flashback were Tony's parents, and the Winter Soldier was the one who killed them. Tony attacks Bucky and fights Steve, angry that Steve never told him the truth. Bucky tries to escape but Tony locks him in the Hydra base with Steve. Zemo tries to kill himself but T'Challa, who followed them, stops him and arrests him. After a big fight, Steve defeats Tony and smashes the Arc Reactor in his Iron Man suit, before leaving with Bucky. Tony tells Steve to drop his shield because he doesn't deserve it; Tony and Steve are not friends anymore and the Avengers are broken.

Knowing that Zemo was his father's killer, T'Challa allows Bucky to recover and heal in Wakanda, which T'Challa now leads as king. Tony returns to the abandoned Avengers base and helps Rhodes use his legs again. Steve sends a letter to Tony, telling him sorry and letting him know that he'll always be there if Tony needs him. Steve breaks into the Raft and helps his friends escape.

Little House on the Prairie

Little House on the Prairie is a children's novel. It was written by Laura Ingalls Wilder. It was published in 1935. It is the third book in Wilder's Little House series. The book and the series are based on Wilder's memories of her family's time in Kansas in the 19th century, but she changed many things so the story would make sense. In the 20th century, it was made into a television series of the same name.

The Ingalls family decides to leave the Big Woods of Wisconsin because Mr. Ingalls thinks there are too many people in the Big Woods. He wants to live where wild animals are not afraid to be. He arranges to sell their house. The family puts their things in a covered wagon. They bring their dog, Jack, but they leave the cat, Black Susan, behind.

They follow a wagon trail west into the part of Kansas that was called "Indian territory" at the time. Mr. Ingalls knows that the land belongs to the American Indians but he thinks the United States federal government is going to change its mind about that. He thinks they will say that white people can settle in Kansas soon. He wants to build a farm before all the good places are taken. He sees a good place near a valley with a river in it, stops the wagon, and starts building a house out of logs from trees from the valley.

The book describes traveling west, building a house, daily chores, taking care of farm animals, meeting and interacting with neighbors, catching and getting better from malaria and interacting with American Indians.

The Ingalls family spends a year building and improving their house and farm. For example, they dig a well and put glass windows in the house. At the end of the book, the Ingalls family hears out that the government has not changed its mind and that all the white settlers must leave. The Ingalls house is three miles over the boundary into what is at that time American Indian land. The family pack their belongings into the covered wagon again and they leave.

In 2018, the Association for Library Service to Children changed the name of its "Laura Ingalls Wilder Award" to the "Children’s Literature Legacy Award" because people did not like the way Wilder wrote about Native Americans in "Little House on the Prairie". They said the book had "dated cultural attitudes toward Indigenous people and people of color that contradict modern acceptance, celebration, and understanding of diverse communities." For example, in the book, one white character says "the only good Indian is a dead Indian." Some of the words Ingalls use to describe Native Americans makes them sound like non-human animals. Other people disagreed, saying the book showed how complicated things between Native Americans and white settlers were. For example, it shows that the Ingalls family is on Indian land illegally, which means they must leave. It shows Laura asking her parents why they are in Indian territory if they don't want to be near Indians.

There is one black character in the book. He is the doctor who cures the family when they catch malaria.

Subtractive color

Subtractive color, or "subtractive color mixing", helps to understand what will be the color of light bounced off paper covered with some layers of inks or dyes. 

This model is the principle of how dyes and inks are used in color printing and photography printing. When the perceived color is obtained after white light passes through microscopic layers of ink or dye allowing some wavelengths of light to reach the eye, but not others.

In color printing, the usual primary colors are cyan, magenta and yellow (CMY). 

Cyan is the complement of red. So, the cyan is a filter that does not allow red color through. The amount of cyan ink put on a white sheet of paper controls how much of the red (in white light) will be reflected back from the paper. Magenta is the complement of green (does not pass it), and yellow is the complement of blue (does not pass it). Combinations of different amounts of the three hues can produce a wide range of colors.

In inkjet color printing and typical mass production printing processes, a black ink called K (Key) component is also used, called CMYK color model. 

RYB (red, yellow, blue) is an older standard set of subtractive primary colors used for mixing pigments. It is used in art, particularly in painting. 

Red, yellow, and blue are the primary colors of the RYB color "wheel". Their secondary colors are violet (or purple), orange, and green (VOG).

Thalidomide scandal

Thalodomide is a drug that was developed in the 1950s. It was used as as a sedative, to treat sleeping problems, and anxiety. Its use in pregnant women in 46 countries resulted in the "biggest man‐made medical disaster ever". More than 10,000 children were born with severe deformities, as well as thousands of miscarriages. A common condition was that hands or feet were directly attached to the body, with all or part of the arm or leg missing. This condition is known as phocomelia. 

Thalidomide was introduced in 1956. The German pharmaceutical company Grünenthal marketed it as a medication for anxiety, trouble sleeping, "tension", and morning sickness. When it was introduced, it had not been tested on pregnant women. At the start, people thought it was safe in pregnancy. The first concerns regarding birth defects were noted in 1961, and the drug was removed from the market in Europe that year.

Thalidomide was developed and first released by the German pharmaceutical company Chemie Grünenthal in 1953. The company had started as a soap maker after World War II to address the urgent market need for antibiotics. Chemist Heinrich Mückter, who was a known Nazi war criminal, was appointed to head the discovery programme based on his experience researching and producing an anti-typhus vaccine for Nazi Germany. 

It is estimated than more than 10.000 people were affected by their mothers using thalidomide during their pregnancy. About 40% of the children died at birth or shortly afterwards. Those who survived had limb, eye, urinary tract, and heart defects. Its initial entry into the US market was prevented by Frances Kelsey at the FDA. The birth defects of thalidomide led to the development of greater drug regulation and monitoring in many countries.

The severity and location of the deformities depended on how many days into the pregnancy the mother was before beginning treatment; thalidomide taken on the 20th day of pregnancy caused central brain damage, day 21 would damage the eyes, day 22 the ears and face, day 24 the arms, and leg damage would occur if taken up to day 28. Thalidomide did not damage the fetus if taken after 42 days' gestation.

The total number of victims worldwide is unknown, estimates range from 10,000 to 20,000.

Because there were many reports of malformations in babies, people were made aware of the side effects of the drug. Most often, limbs are malformed, sometimes they are missing. Some side effects affect the formation of bones, the ear, the heart or other internal organs. The most common form of birth defects from thalidomide is shortened limbs, with the arms being more frequently affected. This syndrome is the presence of deformities of the long bones of the limbs resulting in shortening and other abnormalities.

In 1968, a large criminal trial began in Germany, charging several Grünenthal officials with negligent homicide and injury. After Grünenthal settled with the victims in April 1970, the trial ended in December 1970 with no finding of guilt. As part of the settlement, Grünenthal paid 100 million DM into a special foundation; the German government added 320 million DM. The foundation paid victims a one-time sum of 2,500–25,000 DM (depending on severity of disability) and a monthly stipend of 100–450 DM. The monthly stipends have since been raised substantially and are now paid entirely by the government (as the foundation had run out of money). Grünenthal paid another €50 million into the foundation in 2008.

On 31 August 2012, Grünenthal chief executive Harald F. Stock apologised for the first time for producing the drug and remaining silent about the birth defects. Stock was the Chief Executive Officer of Grünenthal GmbH from January 2009 to May 28, 2013; he was also a Member of the Executive Board until 28 May 2013. At a ceremony, Stock unveiled a statue of a disabled child to symbolise those harmed by thalidomide and apologised for not trying to reach out to victims for over 50 years. At the time of the apology, there were 5,000 to 6,000 sufferers still alive. Victim advocates called the apology "insulting" and "too little, too late", and criticised the company for not compensating victims. They also criticised the company for their claim that no one could have known the harm the drug caused, arguing that there were plenty of red flags at the time.


The disaster prompted many countries to introduce tougher rules for the testing and licensing of drugs. In the United States, the new regulations strengthened the FDA, among other ways, by requiring applicants to prove efficacy and to disclose all side effects encountered in testing. The FDA subsequently initiated the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation to reclassify drugs already on the market.

Ruud Krol

Rudolf Jozef Krol (born 24 March 1949) is a retired Dutch footballer who was capped 83 times for the Netherlands national team. Most of his career he played for his home town club, Ajax, and he became a coach after retirement. Regarded as one of the best defenders of all time, Krol mainly played as a sweeper or left-back, however he could play anywhere across the back line, or in midfield as a defensive midfielder, due to his range of passing with both feet, temperament, tactical intelligence, and ability to start attacking plays after winning back the ball.

He began his career at Ajax under manager Rinus Michels in 1968. In his first season at the club he did not play much. After the departure of left-back Theo van Duivenbode in the summer of 1969 to Feyenoord, Krol became a regular player. When Ajax reached the UEFA European Cup in 1971, and won, Krol did not play because of a broken leg. Krol did play in the European Cup finals of 1972 and 1973. While others such as Johan Cruijff and Johan Neeskens left for new pastures, Krol, captain since the departure of Piet Keizer in October 1974, stayed at Ajax until June 1980.

He moved to the North American Soccer League to play for the Vancouver Whitecaps for one season. He then joined S.S.C. Napoli where he played for the next four seasons. His last club before he retired in 1986 was the French club AS Cannes, at the time in Ligue 2 (the French 2nd division).

Internationally, Krol made his debut for the Netherlands in 1969 against England, retiring from international football in 1983. He was a crucial component in the "Total Football" side of the 1970s. A versatile defender, he could play in any position along the back four or midfield. In the 1974 FIFA World Cup, in which the Netherlands reached the final, Krol primarily played at left-back. He created Cruijff's goal against Brazil and scored a 25-yard screamer against Argentina.

By the time the 1978 FIFA World Cup came about, Krol had switched to playing as a sweeper and had earned the captain's armband after the retirement of Cruijff.

Krol played for the Netherlands as captain at the 1980 European Championship. He played for part of the qualifying for Euro 84, and played his last international in 1983.

In his managerial career, he has been head coach of Egypt, and has been assistant manager of the Netherlands (under Frank Rijkaard and Louis van Gaal) and Ajax (under Ronald Koeman). He became interim manager of Ajax after the resignation of Koeman. He was manager of AC Ajaccio in France Ligue 2 from 2006 to 2007. He returned as manager of Egyptian giants Zamalek in August 2007. He had previously managed them from 1994 to 1999, winning the Egyptian Cup in 1999, the African Cup of Champions Clubs in 1996 and the Afro-Asian Club Championship 1997, the last two being the biggest club level prizes available to CAF clubs. Krol's return to Zamalek was meant to be a stabilizing presence, the club having gone through several managers in the preceding two seasons.
His stay however would be a short one. He ended his sole season by winning one Egyptian Cup with Zamalek, within one season he would leave and sign a three-year contract with the South African giants Orlando Pirates.

In the three years with the Orlando Pirates he won two South African cups (and a finalist once) and won the national league, all in his last year in charge of the team.
Those cups include MTN8 and Nedbank Cup. Despite that success his contract was not renewed.

He won the Tunisian championship with CS Sfaxien in 2012–2013, after a fierce battle with the other 3 of the Tunisian big 4. 
After that success, he was contacted to lead the Tunisian national team in the play off qualifying to the 2014 world cup against Cameroon. He accepted that role and simultaneously became manager of CS Sfaxien and Tunisia in September 2013. 
He won the 2013 CAF Confederation Cup with Sfaxien. 
He resigned from his duties as Sfaxien coach after the second leg of the final against TP Mazembe on 30 November 2013. He quit as the national team interim coach following Tunisia's loss in the World Cup play-off.

In January 2014, he was appointed new head coach of Tunisian side ES Tunis.

On 6 July 1972, Krol married Yvonne van Ingen. The couple have a daughter. On 26 September 1974, together with teammate Arie Haan, he opened a snack bar on Reguliersbreestraat in Amsterdam.

Aging in cats

Reliable information on the lifespans of house cats is hard to find. Research has been done to get an estimate (an educated guess) on how long cats usually live. Cats usually live for 13 to 20 years. Sometimes, cats can live for 22 to 30 years. There are claims of cats dying at ages of over 30 years old.

The "Guinness World Record" for the oldest cat was for a cat named Creme Puff. It lived to be 38 years old. Female cats seem to live longer than male cats. Neutered cats live longer than cats that have not been neutered. Mixed breed cats also appear to live longer than purebred cats. Researchers have also found that cats that weigh more have shorter lifespans.

People sometimes guess how long a cat will live by comparing it to how long a human usually lives. THe age of a cat in "cat years" can be estimated by multiplying the age of the cat in normal years by 7. A better guess for cat years used by veterinarians is: the age of the cat times 4, then plus 16. This math can be used for cats who are at least 2 years old.

This is an example of both ways of estimating cat years for a 5 year old cat:

formula_1

formula_2

The life expectancy of an indoor cat is around 17 years. Cats that live both indoor and outdoor have a similar lifespan. The life expectancy of outdoor only cats is 5.6 years.

Many spaced repetition programs such as Anki have been made to help people to use spaced repetition but it is also possible to do this without software by using the Leitner system.

Items that are to be memorised are entered manually in a question and answer format. When it is time for the item to be learned, either the question or answer is displayed on screen (although it is possible to make it so only the question will be asked) and the user will try to answer it. After answering the user then tells the program how difficult the question was to answer. Depending on the difficulty the program will schedule when the user will see the question again.

Non-Profit Industrial Complex

Non-profit industrial complex, or "NPIC" for short, is a term which is used by social justice activists to describe the way non-profit organizations, governments, and businesses are related. The academic genealogy of the term follows the lineage of what social justice activists and scholars such as Angela Davis and Mike Davis have called the Prison-Industrial Complex, which, too, follows an earlier critique of the military-industrial complex. 

Many activists carry out their work as employees of or with the assistance of non-profit organizations. Many of their goals need money in order to be achieved, and nonprofits are registered with the government in order to be allowed to receive large amounts of money legally. These activist nonprofits usually get money from even bigger nonprofits, which are connected to big businesses and rich people who control industries. But because many activists criticize things in society that businesses and rich people support, they might not get the money if they are too critical. So in order to stay funded, they may have to change the ideas they have for improving society to be more acceptable to industry.

People who believe these kinds of relationships between activists and industries are harmful to activism use the term non-profit industrial complex as a faster way to discuss these relationships, instead of explaining the whole system each time. They have written many articles and books describing the effects of the NPIC by studying patterns of funding or discussing how the goals of some activists changed once their movements began to receive more money.

Two Philadelphia Police Department officers arrived in the area to respond to a domestic dispute. When they arrived, Wallace was getting close to them while holding a knife.

In response to the killing, protests happened throughout Philadelphia on October 26 and 27, many of which became violent, leading to arrests, injuries to police, and deployment of the Pennsylvania National Guard.

Timeline of the far future

The ultimate fate of our universe may be the heat death of the universe or the big rip. Before that happens, it is possible to predict that the following will happen.

Some types of science can say what could happen far into the future. It is worth noting that our local group of galaxies are bound by gravitation, and its changes and aging can be discussed separate from the rest of the universe.

Astrophysics can say how planets and stars form, affect each other, and die; particle physics can say how atoms and other matter act over time; evolutionary biology can allow us to see how living things change over time; and plate tectonics can say how continents move over time. By observing the past and present, astrophysicists, particle physicists, evolutionary biologists and geologists can make guesses about what might happen in the future.

The second law of thermodynamics is important to predictions about the future of Earth, of the Solar System, and the future of the expanding universe. The second law of thermodynamics says that entropy is always happening. That means that the universe is slowly running out of the kind of energy that can do work. For example, stars will eventually run out of hydrogen fuel and burn out.

Erosion is when wind, water or other things make a rock or mountain shrink by breaking of tiny pieces of it off over time.

As of 2020, five machines that travel through outer space are moving toward the edge of the solar system: "Voyager 1", "Voyager 2", "Pioneer 10", "Pioneer 11" and "New Horizons". They will travel into interstellar space. So long as they do not crash into anything, these machines should persist indefinitely.

A time capsule is a box or other container that is buried or hidden on purpose and scheduled to be opened many years later. People place things inside the time capsule so people in the future will find them. For example, someone might place a game, tool, toy, journal, magazine or book inside a time capsule so people in the future would see how the people who buried the time capsule lived, played and worked and what they liked to read.

High roll

A high roll is a hairstyle that Western women wore in the late 1700s.

The style took hours to make. Sometimes, a professional hairdresser would style the woman's hair. That meant the woman had to be rich enough to pay a hairdresser and to spend hours sitting in a chair not working. This made the high roll a status symbol.

The hairstyle could be very tall and make a person's head seem twice as high. First, the woman's hair would be combed. Then the woman or her hairdresser would add pomatum to the hair so it could be shaped. The pomatum would have treated fat, oil and perfumes or spices in it. This would make the hair smell good, kill headlice, and help hold the hair in place. Women would add extra hair collected from cows, horses, or other people. Or they would collect from their own hairbrushes over time and reuse it. Women and hairdressers would use small pillows inside the hair to hold it up. Some women would make curls along the sides or neck with curlers. The hair was held in place with pins. The hair could be natural color or colored gray, brown or white with powder. Some women, for example, Queen Marie Antoinette of France, would wear feathers, jewelry, or sculptures of plants and animals in their high hair. Some women said that it would itch. 

The earliest high rolls started in the late 1760s and became taller over time. They started in France and moved to London and North America.

Many people did not like this hairstyle. English critics complained that English women copied it from France. American critics complained that women copied it from England—and this was in the 1770s, when America was at war with England. Other critics said the feathers in the hairstyles made women look like male soldiers with plumed helmets. American critics also complained that the hairstyle made white women look like African-American men. In the 1770s, African-American men wore their hair in a bunch over their foreheads. Rich men also worried about their wives and daughters spending time with male hairdressers.

There are many political cartoons making fun of the high roll and other high hairstyles.

In the television show "Turn", women in New York and Philadelphia wear and talk about high rolls.

2020 Nice stabbing

On 29 October 2020, three people were Stabbed and killed in an attack in a Roman Catholic church in Nice, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, France. The attack happened between 8:50 and 9:00 AM local time. The mayor of Nice said that this was a terrorist attack. He called it "islamist terrorism". The attacker was an 21 year old Tunisian. The three people killed were a seventy-year-old woman, a woman in her thirties and a member of the clergy. The woman in her thirties was able to leave the church but she died soon after the attack in a nearby restaurant. Local police entered the church and fought with the attacker. The policemen used tasers before they shot him. The attacker was taken to a nearby hospital. 

The attacker was a 21 year old man from Tunisia. He had entered Italy from Lampedusa in late September 2020. The man had travelled to Bari, Apulia on 9 October. He got to France in mid October 2020. He has not asked for asylum in France. This attack happened about a week after another attack. In the earlier attack, a teacher was stabbed after showing cartoons of Muhammad. 

Turkey wished condolences to the families of the people who were killed. 
On the same day, there were two other incidents involving France . In the first incident, an attacker threatened to shoot people near Avignon. There was also an attack on the French consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. After these attacks, the French state raised its security alert to the maximum level.

Marc Hecker, an expert on terrorism, has analyzed this stabbing, a stabbing that happened in September in Paris and the stabbing where a teacher was targeted. He said that that the attacks are probably related to the republication of Muhammad cartoons by Chartlie Hebdo. These cartoons have caused resentment in many Islamic countries. Wassim Nasr, a journalist who deals with Islamic jihadism, said that it is not political jihad which motivates these attacks: "These people feel attacked in their faith, but do not have a political project as such, such as dividing French society or the departure of the French armies from the Sahel. On the other hand, the fact that they act alone and without ties to the jihadist sphere makes their surveillance almost impossible."

He was played by Tobey Maguire in all three movies and tie-in video games. Two later, un-related versions of Spider-Man came after this one in two separate movie series, namely one version in Marc Webb's films, and another one in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Peter Parker was raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben. He is very smart and a good student, but is picked on by his classmates. After a spider bites him during a field trip, Peter gains spider-like superhero abilities. He uses his powers selfishly at first, but after Uncle Ben is killed, Peter realizes that "with great power comes great responsibility" and starts using his powers to protect the people of New York City, becoming Spider-Man. Throughout the movie series, Spider-Man fights villains such as the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Sandman, and Venom while also maintaining friendships with Harry Osborn and his long-time crush Mary-Jane Watson, who later falls in love with him.

The designers wanted a more comic-accurate design for his suit, but many considered the mask too creepy, so they went with the helmet seen in the movie.

Norman Osborn is the CEO of OSCORP and father of Harry Osborn, the best friend of Peter Parker. After being pressured by the American government to complete a project for them, Norman tests the project – a drug that is supposed to turn people into super-powered soldiers – on himself, turning himself into the crazy, evil Green Goblin and developing a split personality. After Peter becomes Spider-Man, he battles the Goblin several times. 

Norman eventually finds out Peter's secret identity, then attacks Peter's Aunt May and crush Mary-Jane Watson to try to bait him. Peter, as Spider-Man, manages to defeat the Goblin before Norman reveals himself. Despite finding out his best friend's dad is the Goblin, Peter refuses to work with Norman, who then tries to kill Peter but ends up killing himself instead. Harry then thinks Spider-Man killed his father, not knowing about the bad things Norman did as the Green Goblin until later in the movie series.

Willem Dafoe's portrayal has been well-liked and considered one of the best movie supervillains of all time despite his design.

Phantom of Heilbronn

Phantom of Heilbronn, or ""Woman Without a Face"" is the name of a suspected female serial killer. The killer is only known from DNA evidence. This evidence was present at different crime scenes in Austria, France, and Germany. The crimes were committed (or happened) between 1993 and 2009. Six of the crimes were murders. One of the murders was that of Michèle Kieswetter, a police officer. She was killed in Heilbronn on 25 April 2007.

The DNA had been found in 40 different crime scenes. There were many types of crimes committed - from burglaries to killings. In late March 2009, investigators concluded that the "Phantom" criminal did not exist. The DNA recovered at the crime scenes had already been present on the cotton swabs used for collecting DNA samples. The DNA belonged to a woman who worked at the factory where they were made.

The events were fictionalized in different serial episodes. 

An analysis of the mitochondrial DNA from the samples collected in Austria showed that it was most often found among people in Eastern Europe and neighboring Russia. This was not discovered in the German investigations. The analysis of mitochondrial DNA done in criminal proceedings is limited. The analysis could only determine a few other personal attributes of a suspect apart from sex. The killer existence was disputed, but is now said to be untrue.

The investigations focused on a special task force "parking lot" at the Heilbronn police department. In January 2009, the reward for clues regarding the whereabouts of the person was increased to €300,000.

The existence of the "Phantom" had been doubted earlier, but in March 2009, the case took a new turn. Investigators discovered the DNA profile on the burned body of a male asylum-seeker in France. This was an anomaly, since the profile was of a female. They subsequently came to the conclusion that the mysterious criminal did not exist. They found that the laboratory results were the due to the cotton buds used for DNA collection being contaminated. Although sterile, the swabs are not certified for human DNA collection.

The cotton swabs used by many state police departments were found to have been contaminated before shipping. It was found that the contaminated swabs all came from the same factory, which employs several Eastern European women who fit the type the DNA was assumed to match. Bavaria, although a region central to the crimes, obtained their swabs from a different factory. They had no reports of crimes committed by the Phantom.

The DNA attributed to the "Phantom" was found at the scene, as well as purportedly at the sites of the following crimes:


As a consequence of this severe case of contamination with human DNA in a series of forensic investigations, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) published the standard ISO 18385 in 2016. ISO 18385 defines the requirements for producing consumables free of human DNA contamination for collecting biological evidence at crime scenes. The requirement reads: "Minimizing the risk of human DNA contamination in products used to collect, store and analyse biological material for forensic purposes".

Racism in Thailand

Racism in Thailand is a system where Thailand's society treats people better or worse depending on their appearance (like skin color, hair, and face) as well as where they are from. Racism is a system that exists around the world, but because every country is different, the system may work differently in different places. Some parts of racism in Thailand are taken from other countries, but other parts are unique.

Much of Southeast Asia has a long history of assuming people with darker skin have dark skin because they work outdoors farming and are poor. These assumptions are often wrong, but they are used to justify treating light-skinned people better and dark-skinned people worse. As a result, many people in Thailand have tried to make their skin whiter. Today, major companies like Unilever make a lot of money in Thailand selling products that make skin whiter.

Thailand also has a history of slavery. The Maniq (or Mani) people of Thailand are an indigenous people with dark skin who have been enslaved by monarchs from Malaysia and Thailand. People often refer to them using offensive slurs that mean "slave" in a practice similar to slavery in the United States.

The Black Lives Matter movement caused people to share experiences with racism around the world. One student wrote an article in a major newspaper saying that Thai people who believe there is no racism there are wrong. Another newspaper interviewed a priest who came to Thailand from the United States and was treated badly; the police assumed he was a drug dealer from Africa. Assumptions that black people are from Africa, are violent, and are very involved with drugs has been spread around the world by white people from places like the United States and Europe.

One Thai vlogger, Natthawadee 'Suzie' Waikalo, has frequently discussed how racism impacted her growing up. In September 2020, a model in Thailand was called African and many racial slurs after she won a beauty pageant, because some people did not think her skin was light enough and she supported protests that are happening in the country.

Mediterranean diet

The Mediterranean diet is a way of eating. The Mediterranean diet is not only food. It is also the skills and traditions people use to make it, for example farming, fishing, and cooking. It is also the traditions and culture about food and meals.

In the second half of the 20th century, people far from the Mediterranean Sea began to eat a Mediterranean diet to become healthier. In 2019, "U.S. News and World Report" named the Mediterranean diet "Best Overall Diet." 

A scientist named Ancel Keys started studying the Mediterranean diet in the 1950s. He saw that people in poor Italian villages were healthier than people in New York.

In 2013, the United Nations declared the Mediterranean diet intangible cultural heritage from Cyprus, Croatia, Spain, Greece, Italy, Morocco and Portugal.

The diet is based on what peasants, people who worked on farms, in countries around the Mediterranean Sea would eat during the Middle Ages and later, for example, Italian farm workers. They ate a lot of olive oil, beans, and whichever fresh vegetables were growing at that time of year. Meat was expensive, so it was not the main part of the meal. The Mediterranean diet does have foods from North and South America, for example tomatoes.

Scientists saw that people who ate a Mediterranean diet had less anxiety and depression. People with type 1 diabetes who ate Mediterranean diet had healthier lives and were less likely to get Crohn's disease.

Professional diet scientists and experts say that the Mediterranean diet can be expensive. A tomato does not cost much money to someone who lives next to a tomato farm and is buying it when it is ripe. It costs more when it is put on an airplane and flown to the middle of a North American city and stored until winter. Other studies show that a Mediterranean diet is not much more expensive than a North American diet.

Many people think they are eating a Mediterranean diet when they eat pizza, pasta or other foods that are not part of the Mediterranean diet.

Barfi!

Barfi! is a 2012 Indian Hindi-language romantic comedy film written and directed by Anurag Basu, edited by Akiv Ali and produced by Ronnie Screwwala and Siddharth Roy Kapur under the banner of UTV Motion Pictures. The film stars Ranbir Kapoor as the eponymous lead with Priyanka Chopra and Ileana D'Cruz, while Saurabh Shukla, Ashish Vidyarthi, Jisshu Sengupta, Roopa Ganguly and Haradhan Bandopadhyay star in pivotal roles. Set in 1970s Darjeeling and Kolkata, the film is about Barfi (Kapoor), a deaf-mute young man based in Darjeeling, and his relationships with two lovely girls, the beautiful Shruti (D'Cruz), and the autistic Jhilmil (Chopra).

Murphy Johnson (Ranbir Kapoor), also known as Barfi, is an optimistic, street-wise, charming young man born deaf and mute to a lower middle-class Nepali family in Darjeeling. His mother died while giving birth to him and his father, Jungbahadur, (Akash Khurana) raised him as a single parent while working as a chauffeur. Barfi is known to be a troublemaker - he cuts lampposts, plays practical jokes on innocent people, and is often pursued comically by Inspector Sudhanshu Dutta (Saurabh Shukla), a local police officer. Barfi meets Shruti Ghosh (Ileana D'Cruz), a gorgeous, educated young girl, who is new in Darjeeling. She is engaged to a rich man, Ranjeet Sengupta (Jisshu Sengupta), and is due to get married in three months. Barfi is smitten by her heavenly beauty and tries to woo her. Shruti also falls in love with Barfi, but her mother (Roopa Ganguly) dissuades her from pursuing him, pointing out that he could not take care of her with his disabilities and lack of money. Shruti unwillingly agrees to her mother's advice, gets married to Ranjeet, and leaves the town, breaking all contact with Barfi.

Shortly after Shruti's departure, Jungbahadur loses his job as a chauffeur and suffers from kidney failure, compelling Barfi to somehow raise ₹7000 for his hospital treatment. After an unsuccessful attempt of robbing a local bank due to Inspector Dutta's intervention, Barfi contemplates the kidnapping of Jhilmil Chatterjee (Priyanka Chopra), his autistic childhood friend and wealthy heiress of her late grandfather's fortune, for a ransom. Upon arriving, Barfi finds out that she has already been kidnapped from her house and spots her in an unattended van. He sneaks in and drives Jhilmil away from the ransom delivery. Barfi proceeds to hide her in his apartment with the police in pursuit and delivers a ransom note pasted with words in newspaper cut-outs to Jhilmil's wealthy father, Durjoy Chatterjee (Ashish Vidyarthi). Although Barfi is able to collect the ransom from Jhilmil's father, he is aghast to discover that Jungbahadur has died just as he makes the hospital payment. Dejected, Barfi tries to leave Jhilmil at her caretaker's village, but she refuses to leave him and the two soon move to Kolkata, where Barfi assumes responsibility for Jhilmil and strives hard to take care of her.

Six years later, Barfi and Shruti reunite by fate in a street-side utensil shop. Shruti is unhappy with her marriage with Ranjeet and tries to rekindle her friendship with Barfi, much to chagrin of the lovestruck Jhilmil, who then goes missing in the city. Shruti files a missing complaint for Jhilmil and Inspector Dutta, causing the Darjeeling police to resume their pursuit of Barfi and arrest him. During the process of interrogation, another ransom demand for Jhilmil is made and she is apparently killed in the process of exchange, though her dead body is never discovered. In order to conclude the case, the police decide to frame Barfi for Jhilmil's murder. Inspector Dutta, who grew fond of Barfi after pursuing him for his nuisances, asks Shruti to take him away, offering him a second chance in life. Shruti agrees and hopes that since now Jhilmil is gone, she can finally be with Barfi.

However, Barfi is deeply affected by Jhilmil's loss and finds living with Shruti unfulfilling. Eventually, he stumbles upon Jhilmil's special-care home address on the scribbles that she had made in their house. Barfi takes Shruti to the location to search for her and the two learn that Jhilmil has been alive all along, and that both the kidnappings were fabricated by her father so that he could embezzle money from Jhilmil's trust fund. In the second attempt, the second time, Jhilmil's father and the special-care home owner, Daju (Haradhan Bandopadhyay), together faked her death, so that Jhilmil could return to her special-care home, away from her alcoholic mother (Preeti Mamgain). Barfi and Jhilmil have a happy reunion at the special-care home and the two are married, while Shruti spends the rest of her days alone, prosperous, having lost her chance to be with Barfi.

Several years later, an elderly Barfi is shown to be seriously ill and on his deathbed at the hospital. Jhilmil lies with him on the hospital bed, while Shruti narrates how they both died peacefully, not wanting to leave each other behind in life or death. The film ends with the happy days of Barfi and Jhilmil in their old age at the special-care home and the credits roll.

Emancipation reform of 1861

The Emancipation Reform of 1861 in Russia, also known as the Emancipation Edict of Russia, ( – "peasants' reform of 1861") was the first and most important of the liberal reforms passed during the reign (1855–1881) of Emperor Alexander II of Russia. The reform effectively abolished serfdom throughout the Russian Empire.

The 1861 Emancipation Manifesto proclaimed the emancipation of the serfs on private estates and of the domestic (household) serfs. By this edict more than 23 million people received their liberty. Serfs gained the full rights of free citizens, including rights to marry without having to gain consent, to own property and to own a business. The Manifesto prescribed that peasants would be able to buy the land from the landlords. Household serfs were the least affected: they gained only their freedom and no land.

In Georgia the emancipation took place later, in 1864, and on much better terms for the nobles than in Russia. The serfs were emancipated in 1861, after a speech given by Tsar Alexander II on 30 March 1856. State owned serfs, i.e., those living on Imperial lands, were emancipated later, in 1866.

Sergei Kirov

Sergei Mironovich Kostrikov or better known as Sergei Kirov (born 27 March 1886, O.S. 15 March, Urzhum, Russian Empire – died 1 December 1934, Leningrad, RSFSR, Soviet Union), was a Soviet politician and Bolshevik revolutionary whose assassination led to the first Great Purge in 1936, that was organised by Joseph Stalin and the NKVD (Genrikh Yagoda, Nikolai Yezhov and Lavrenty Beria). 

Sergei Kirov joined the RSDLP in 1904 led by Lenin. Sergei Kirov was involved in the 1905 Russian Revolution until it ended in 1907. He then moved to the Caucasus where he stayed until the [1917 Russian Revolution and Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate the throne ending the long Russian Monarchy. He was also involved in the Russian Civil War of 1917 until it ended in 1923. Sergei Kirov was also involved in the 1918-1921 Polish–Soviet War until it ended in 1921 just two years before both Russian Revolution and the Russian Civil War ended in 1923 in the Soviet Union. Lenin died in 1924 aged 54 and Felix Dzerzhinsky, Alexei Rykov, Leon Trotsky and Lev Kamenev, all tried to replace Lenin, but it was Joseph Stalin who came to power in 1924. Stalin and Kirov were friends until Kirov was shot and killed in 1934 at the age of 48, possibly by the NKVD on the order of Stalin. And it led Stalin to kill Alexei Rykov, Lev Kamenev and other Leninists. Stalin had Genrikh Yagoda and Nikolai Yezhov executed in 1938 and 1940 by Lavrentiy Beria. Stalin ordered Leon Trotsky to be assassinated in August 1940 during the Second World War, who had fled to Mexico in 1937.

He was the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan and the leader of the Azerbaijan SSR, between 1921 and 1926.

He was Chief of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Leningrad, from 1927 until he was assassinated on 1 December 1934.

It is speculated by historians, that the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin ordered his assassination, because he saw Kirov, who was popular, as a threat to his rule, and started the Great Purge as an excuse to eliminate all his real and potential rivals.

Large-scale structure of the Universe

The term Large Scale structure of the Universe refers to the patterns of galaxies and matter on scales much larger than individual galaxies and groupings of galaxies. These correlated structures can be seen up to billion of light years in length and are created and shaped by gravity. On large scales, the Universe displays coherent structure with galaxies residing in groups and clusters on scale(s)of ~1-3 megaparsecs(Mpc) which lie at the intersections of long filament of galaxies that are usually >10 Mpc in length. Vast regions of relatively empty space, known as voids, contain very few galaxies and span in the volume in between these structures.

It's amplified to enormous proportion by gravitational forces, producing ever-growing concentrations of dark matter in which ordinary gases cool, condense and fragment to create galaxies.

The Large Scale Structure incorporates the notion of all the content in the universe which includes Galaxies —most of them bound in Galaxy clusters and Superclusters,Dark matter and Dark energy. While precise figures are impossible to acquire, it is currently thought that Dark Energy makes up 68% of the universe, Dark Matter follows with 27%, Radiation (Neutrinos and Photons) consisting of 0.1-0.2% meanwhile matter (anything made up of Atoms) consists of 4.9%. Other revised studies suggest that Dark Energy makes up 70% of the universe, Dark Matter following suit with 25%, Free Hydrogen and Helium make up ~4%,Neutrinos constituting 0.3% and other chemical elements constituting 0.003%.

The composition and contents of the universe have changed over time,have influenced the Cosmos' evolution and will decide the Ultimate fate of the universe. After the Big Bang and for the next 3 billion years, the universe was Radiation dominated as can be evidenced from the Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB).For the next 3—7.7 billion years, the universe was matter dominated and its expansion started to progressively slow down, however, since then, the universe became dominated by a poorly understood form on vacuum energy known as Dark Energy. — a form of energy that has since then accelerated the universe's expansion.

"Main article: Dark energy"The term "dark energy" can be used to refer to a subset of all causes of the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. In 1998, two Cosmology research teams, the High-Z Supernova Search Team and the Supernova Cosmology Project set out to measure the universe's rate of expansion which, according to Cosmological methods of the time, should have being slowing down as the immense gravitational pull generated by the Cosmic Web should have dominated over the expansion rate drawing the observable universe's contents back into a singularity as the Big Crunch predicted. Instead, via the measurement of very distant supernovae, Cosmologists deduced that the universe was expanding, and that the expansion rate was indeed uncontrollably accelerating, seemingly caused by an unknown spacetime phenomena now given the term "dark energy." Dark Energy's nature is still unknown, even less well understood unlike the hypothetical dark matter. It is probably in the form of an exotic type of vacuum energy exerting negative pressure on the universe.

Its density is also extremely low,~6×10-¹⁰ J/m³ or ~7×10 g/cm³. Much less than the density of normal matter or dark matter. However, it is dominant because

(2.) Its values add up over large cosmic scales and dominates over gravitational energy at such scales.

Due to this inherit dominance, it is Dark Energy's behavior which will dictate the universe's far future.

"For the full article,see Dark matter"Dark matter is the term given to an apparent hypothetical invisible mass that is currently thought to consist of 85% of the universe's mass. It is thought that every galaxy has dark matter worth the galaxy's mass many times over, primarily situated at the outer edges of galaxies. It is currently agreed that dark matter must be some kind of hypothetical particle unknown to the Standard Model.

Dark Matter's existence was first postulated by Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky who hypothesized it's existence based on observations of the Coma Cluster. Applying the virial theorem, Zwicky noticed that there was an apparent contradiction based on the speed of the galaxies which indirectly led him to obtain evidence of dark matter which he called dunkle materie (literally "dark matter"). Zwicky estimated its mass based on the motions of galaxies near its edge and compared that to an estimate based on its brightness and number of galaxies. He estimated the cluster had about 400 times more mass than was visually observable. The gravitational effect of the visible galaxies was far too small for such fast orbits, thus there must have been mass hidden from view. Based on these conclusions, Zwicky inferred that some unseen matter provided the mass and associated gravitational attraction to hold the cluster together. Zwicky's estimates were off by more than an order of magnitude, mainly due to an obsolete value of the Hubble constant, the same calculation today shows a smaller fraction, using greater values for luminous mass. Nonetheless, Zwicky did correctly conclude from his calculation that the bulk of the matter in the Coma cluster was dark matter. Generally though, it is agreed by physicists that dark matter will not play any significant role in regards to the Far Future of the universe

'Normal' Matter & Radiation

Baryonic Matter

A baryon is a particle consisting of three quarks/antiquarks (In other words, a hadron). Therefore, baryonic matter can in very rather simple terms be referred to as anything consisting of particles consisting of three standard model based particles. By extension, this includes atoms,groups of atoms(molecules) and the various large scale structures they form such as humans,the Earth, stars etc. Baryonic matter in much simpler commutative terms is what can interact electromagnetically, gravitationally and via the weak force and the strong nuclear force.

On the largest scales, normal matter contributes to the Cosmic Web. A spread collection of all the universe's contents in in its sheer volume into a series of protruding structures synonymous to webs. With the path constituent of galaxy filaments made up of Galactic walls which are then made up of superclusters,galaxy clusters, individual galaxy groups and on to individual collections of galaxies. 

"For the full article, see Radiation"

Radiation can best and most accurately be termed as the movement of particles or energy through space. There's many forms of radiation from gravitational waves (sometimes simply termed as "gravitational radiation") to electromagnetic radiation (light, also "electromagnetic waves.")

However, due to such a broad definition, the universe is full of radiation everywhere, from the billions of neutrinos passing through our bodies and Earth to the light that is being received by your eyes.

2020 Puerto Rican status referendum

A referendum of the status of Puerto Rico is was held on November 3, 2020. It asked the people if they think Puerto Rico should become a U.S. State. It will happened same day as the gubernatorial and presidential elections, and others. The Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vázquez Garced first spoke about this on May 16, 2020. This is the sixth time a referendum has been held to see if Puerto Rico should be a state. The last one of these happened in 2017. 

This referendum is not binding, meaning it still might not become a state even if there are more "yes" votes. This is because only the United States Congress can add new states. Both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party (the main two parties in Congress) said they would make Puerto Rico a state if their people wanted to. The question in the referendum is written in the same way as the referendums that made Alaska and Hawaii states in the 1950s.

Pan-Arab colors

The Pan-Arab colors are black, white, green, and red. Individually, each of the four Pan-Arab colors were intended to represent a certain Arab dynasty, or era. The representations are as follows:

The origin of the colors goes back to the 14 century during the time of an Iraqi poet known as Safi Al-Din Al-Hilli. In one of his poems, there is a line that makes reference to the four colors. The line talks about white representing the acts of people, the black representing their struggles, the green standing for the fields where these struggles are fought on, while the red is for swords.

The first time these colors were used together was back in 1916 when the flag of the Arab Revolt was designed. The flag was a simple design involving three stripes of black, green, and white from the top respectively. The red color was in the shape of a triangle originating from the left side. There are several flags with these colors. These flags include Jordan, Palestine, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. The brief union known as the Arab Federation of Iraq and Jordan also had a flag that used the colors.

The Pan-Arab colors continued to be used until the 1950s. From there onward, the Arab Liberation colors started becoming more popular and eventually replaced the Pan-Arab ones. The new colors were almost the same as the old ones with a slight difference. In the new scheme, the flag featured three bands of white, black, and red. The green was not eliminated but it was given much less prominence compared to previous designs. Under the new flag, the colors adopted a different meaning altogether. The black now stood for past foreign oppressors, the red symbolized the bloody sacrifices made, and the white was representative of a bright future full of hope.

The inspiration for these new colors can be traced back to the Arab Liberation flag that was in use during the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 (also called the July 23 revolution). The revolution was led by two army officers, Gamal Abdel Nasser and Mohammed Naguib, who wanted to do away with the reign of King Farouk. The new colors appear today in several flags. These flags include those of Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Iraq, and Yemen. Even before Yemen merged, the rival states that made up the larger Yemen, North and South Yemen, both had the colors in their respective flags. There were also Arab unions that did not last very long but had the Arab Liberation colors. These unions were the Federation of Arab Republics and the United Arab Republic.

Hurricane Eta

Hurricane Eta was a Category 4 hurricane that caused a lot of damage for parts of Central America in early November 2020. Eta originated from a tropical wave in the eastern Caribbean Sea on October 31. The system organized very quickly as it moved west, and the cyclone peaked as a Category 4 hurricane on November 3. The storm started to quickly weaken as the system made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, late that same day. Eta weakened to a tropical depression as it slowly moved across Central America before moving north into the Caribbean, toward Cuba on November 7. Over the next five days, the system moved very oddly, moving through the Florida Keys, before moving into the southern Gulf of Mexico. Reaching hurricane strength for a short time, it weakened once more and quickly moved across the Southeastern United States on November 12. It dissipated the next day.

Hurricane and tropical storm watches and warnings happened along the coast of Honduras and Nicaragua as Eta approached. At least 178 deaths across Central America have been related to the storm. Eta brought heavy rainfall and gusty winds to the Cayman Islands and Cuba. Parts of Southern Florida had to be evacuated because of Eta and other floods. 11 deaths were related to the storm in the U.S. Nearly $8 billion in damages were reported across all affected areas by December 2020.

Relief efforts for those hit by the storm were set up in several countries. About 2.5 million were affected by the storm, including 1.7 million in Honduras. Many Emergency Response Units were to help support affected people. About 100 tons of food and water were given to Nicaragua and Honduras from Panama. People left homeless were moved to many shelters after the storm had passed. Donations worth millions of USD had been given to affected countries to help recoveries.

On October 28, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) started watching the Southwestern Caribbean. There was an area that could become a tropical cyclone. Over the next couple of days, the area became more organized, becoming a disturbance, and on October 31, satellite and microwave imagery said that a circulation had formed in the disturbance, and the NHC began issuing advisories on "Tropical Depression Twenty-Nine." Early on November 1, the system intensified into "Tropical Storm Eta", becoming the earliest tropical storm on record in an Atlantic hurricane season, beating Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005.

Continuing west due to a ridge, Eta slowly organized throughout the day as cold convection began to form on top of its center. After holding onto tropical storm strength for 15 hours, Eta began to intensify very quickly, becoming a Category 4 hurricane mid-day of November 2, with lots of lightning being observed in its eyewall. Eta begun to slow down and turn west-southwestward because of a ridge over the United States. Early on November 3, a airplane found the system still intensifying with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a pressure of 927 mbar as it slowed. According to the NHC, Eta maintained its peak winds as it reached its lowest pressure of 923 mbar shortly after, marking its peak intensity as a strong Category 4 hurricane. Even though the storm was in a in a good location, Eta began to weaken six hours after its peak because of an eyewall replacement cycle, which it completed as it made landfall later that day, south of Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, with winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) and a pressure of 940 mbar. Land caused Eta to weaken very quickly as it moved slowly west after landfall with its eye disappearing and its convection weakening. Only a little over a day after Eta made landfall, Eta had weakened to a tropical depression.

Eta, barely holding onto tropical cyclone status, began turning northeastward, eventually moving back over the Caribbean Sea on November 6 and speeding up due to a developing trough over the Gulf of Mexico. On November 7, the system started to become better organized, and it became a tropical storm again later that day. Even with strong wind shear, the storm continued to strengthen through the day and reached a second peak of winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a pressure of 991 mbar at 00:00 UTC on November 8. It then held its strength and slowed slightly before making landfall on the south central coast of Cuba at 09:00 UTC. Eta weakened after making landfall in Cuba's Sancti Spíritus Province, but this was brief as it quickly moved back over water in the Atlantic Ocean. Eta began to strengthen again as it turned toward Florida as a result of a low that had formed over the northwestern Caribbean Sea near the Isle of Youth.

Eta briefly gained a eye feature before bad conditions removed most of its convection, though the storm was able to maintain its intensity as it grew in size and approached South Florida. At 04:00 UTC on November 9, Eta made its third landfall on the Lower Matecumbe Key in the Florida Keys with the same intensity as its Cuban landfall. It then passed just south of the southwestern coast of Florida as it turned west. Eta began moving southwestward under the influence of a strong ridge across the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, and near the US East Coast. This also brought it into an area of very dry air, causing the storm to weaken and its area of gale-force winds to shrink. However, even after its center became sheared to the west of its convection, Eta began to intensify again over the warm waters of the Gulf. Eta than began to speed up north-northeast around the western edge of a subtropical ridge as its center reformed under the convection and an eye formed. Eta then regained hurricane status at 12:35 UTC on November 11, reaching a fourth peak intensity with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) and a pressure of 983 mbar.

Shortly after its peak, dry air rapidly removed the convection and caused the eye to be gone, causing Eta to weaken back into a tropical storm at 18:00 UTC. The system turned further east and made landfall near Cedar Key, Florida at 09:00 UTC on November 12, with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). The storm weakened over land as it sped toward the north-northeast, eventually emerging over the waters of the Atlantic near the Florida–Georgia border at 18:00 UTC. Eta came out with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) before restrengthening as it began its extratropical transition. The storm completed its transition on November 13. On the next day, Eta was absorbed into another frontal system to the north.

Early on November 1, Honduras and Nicaragua put in Hurricane Watches and warnings for the northeastern coast of Honduras from Punta Patuca to Nicaragua and the northeastern coast of Nicaragua from the Honduras border to Puerto Cabezas. Later that day, a hurricane warning was put in from the Honduras–Nicaragua border to Sandy Bay Sirpi, while a tropical storm warning was put in for areas from Punta Patuca to the Honduras–Nicaragua border. A tropical storm watch was also issued from west of Punta Patuca westward to Punta Castilla late that same day.

Some people were worried that of storm surge along the coastline may happen, so Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega issued a yellow alert for most of the western departments on October 31. They were upgraded to a red alert by November 2. People in coastal towns were told to leave as supplies, including 88 tons of food, sleeping bags, hygiene kits, and plastic, were brought to Puerto Cabezas according to SINAPRED. The navy of Nicaragua helped more than 3,000 families from offshore islands to Puerto Cabezas as people in the city waited in long lines to access cash machines while getting supplies. Just before the storm's arrival, the army of Nicaragua moved red-helmeted troops to Puerto Cabezas to help in search and rescue efforts that would happen because of Eta. More than 10,000 people were at shelters in Puerto Cabezas and surrounding villages to wait out the storm.

Alerts were placed for all of Honduras The Honduran Air Force told two planes to send 4,000 pounds of food to La Mosquitia, Gracias a Dios. The National Police of Honduras was told to tell passengers of roadways blocked by a landslide or flooding. More than 20,000 pounds of food were stored at the Offices of Risk Management and National Contingencies in San Pedro Sula, ahead of the storm. Because of Hurricane Eta, in order to limit movements and protect human lives, the Honduran government cancelled the Morazanico national holiday.

The Civil Protection Directorate of El Salvador evacuated residents in Tecoluca after setting up 1,152 shelters across the country. The Autonomous Executive Port Commission thought of closing the El Salvador International Airport due to Eta. The Executive Hydroelectric Commission of the Lempa River cleared pipes to make sure flooding didn’t happen in communities along the river.

Costa Rica's National Meteorological Institute forecast lots of rainfall because of the outer bands of Eta, mostly along the Pacific coastline. With flooding starting at the night of November 2, the National Emergency Commission (NCE) put up multiple shelters for people leaving. The agency planned to set up three types of shelters due to the COVID-19 pandemic: infected people, people who might be infected, and non-infected persons. Landslides were expected in many areas due to wet soils.

Although not in the path of Eta, the hurricane was expected to cause damage in Panama. Machines alerted to dangerous swells in Caribbean waters, along with wind gusts up to . The Ministry of Public Works told residents to stay alert for possible flooding and landslides. Road crews were sent to make sure highways remained clear for travel.

As flooding was a major threat because of heavy rainfall, a flood warning was issued for all of Belize because of Eta, as the National Emergency Management Organization urged residents to evacuate.

Once the Cayman Islands came close to the cone of Tropical Depression Eta on November 5, tropical storm watches were issued for Grand Cayman and all of the other islands. This came after Eta became forecast to become a tropical storm again before brushing by the islands. Government schools were closed in the islands on November 6 due to the threat of Eta. The next day, tropical storm warnings were put into effect for all of the islands.

On November 6, the Government of Cuba issued a tropical storm watch for many provinces of the western provinces of Cuba. Later that day, these were upgraded to tropical storm warnings in some provinces.

Late on November 6, tropical storm watches were issued for the northwestern Bahamas. The next day, these watches were upgraded to tropical storm warnings.

On November 6, tropical storm watches were issued for the Florida Keys and parts of the coast of the Florida Peninsula. The next day, these were upgraded to tropical storm warnings in the Florida Keys and the southern tip of the peninsula. On November 7, Hurricane Watches and Warnings were issued for much of the Florida peninsula and both Tropical Storm Warnings and Watches were extended further north. Residents of small homes and other structures in the Florida Keys were told to evacuate ahead of Tropical Storm Eta as a state of emergency was declared in some counties including Monroe and Miami-Dade. Later, Hurricane Warnings were issued for the Florida Keys. All the warnings for Florida were cancelled by November 9, only to have more issued the next day along the western side of the state as Eta changed directions.

Eta's intensity at the beginning of its lifetime followed by its odd path afterwards bought devastating impacts across Central America, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and Florida with heavy rainfall, strong winds, and flash flooding causing most of the damage.

Despite passing north of the archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina, Eta still brought some damage to the island. Wind speeds of cut down the trees and damaged houses, and Eta also caused severe flooding on the island. Damage across the archipelago reached COL$3 billion (US$777,000). Across the archipelago, two people were injured and 141 families were affected. A total of 6 homes were destroyed while another 64 homes and 24 businesses had damage.

As Eta neared landfall, its winds downed power lines and trees while causing flooding and damaging roofs in Puerto Cabezas. At the Getsemani School, where 215 people were waiting out the storm, Eta's strong winds ripped 10 sheets of metal off the school's roof. No one was injured in the incident. The Wawa River that connects Puerto Cabezas to the rest of Nicaragua had too much water in its banks. Two people in the municipality of Bonanza died after they were buried in a landslide while working in a mine. Eta caused C$6.128 billion (US$178.4 million) of damage in Nicaragua.

Hurricane Eta had life-changing effects on Honduras, largely due to flooding. Flooding caused 559 residents to get out of their homes and two others had to be rescued. At least 457 homes were damaged by floodwaters, 41 communities were cut off by washed-out roads, and at least nine bridges were destroyed including one in La Ceiba. In La Ceiba, floodwaters rushed through streets, and the flooding also washed away a structure at a local cemetery. A ferry leaving Roatán was rocked by large waves and winds with 300 passengers onboard while trying to reach the port of La Ceiba. Nobody was injured on the ferry. The Permanent Contingency Commission of Honduras said that 14 roads and 339 homes were destroyed. In Olanchito, 12 people, including two newborns, were trapped. A wall collapsed at a prison in El Progreso letting in waist-deep floodwaters, causing the evacuation of more than 600 inmates. At least 74 people were killed across Honduras as a result of Eta, mainly due to landslides and drownings. Among the dead were at least four people, including three children, who were killed in the mountains outside the north coast city of Tela due to landslides. In Santa Barbara, a 2-year-old girl was killed when she and her mother were swept away by floodwaters; the mother survived. Four members of the same family died in the municipality of Gualala due to heavy rains. A 13-year-old girl was killed when mud and rain caused her home to collapse in the village of Carmen. In Sulaco, a 15-year-old boy drowned while trying to cross a river that was full due to rain. A 37-year-old man also drowned in San Manuel, in the western part of the Lempira Department. Total economic losses in Honduras are estimated to be over 125 billion lempiras (US$5 billion).

According to the country's president, Alejandro Giammattei, at least 60% of the eastern city of Puerto Barrios was flooded with another 48 hours of rain expected. About 100 homes were damaged by flooding and landslides. A bridge crossing the Río Grande de Zacapa in Jocotán was washed away. At least 53 people died across Guatemala, while an additional 96 missing. An estimated 343,000 people were directly affected by the storm. The village of Queja near San Cristobal Verapaz in the center of the country was very hard-hit, with a landslide burying 150 homes. Over 100 people were buried from the landslide, and rescuers began searching them on November 9. However, the searching was called off two days later. Infrastructural damage were amounted to be exceed Q3 billion (US$386 million).

Heavy rainfall affected much of El Salvador as Eta passed to the northeast. Rainfall got over a total of with a maximum of in the La Unión Department. A total of 107 communities had power outages. Across the nation, 1,991 people required evacuation because of floods and landslides. Even with a ban on fishing activities, one fisherman drowned off the coast of Playa El Espino in the Usulután Department.

The outer bands of Hurricane Eta brought heavy rainfall to portions of Costa Rica. The heaviest rains were mostly along the nation's Pacific coast, especially in Guanacaste Province.

Yellow pond turtle

The Yellow pond turtle ("Mauremys mutica") is a medium-sized turtle which can grow up to 19.5 cm long. It belongs to the family Geoemydidae. It is a semi-aquatic species. This species of turtle has a wide yellow stripe starting from behind the eye and down the neck. 

The yellow pond turtle is found in East Asia. The places it can be found includes central Vietnam, coastal provinces of south and central China. There are some other populations of the turtle that are separate from the rest of the species. These can be found in Taiwan, Hainan, Ryukyu Islands, and Japan. The Japanese populations are thought to come from Taiwan.

This species lives in ponds, creeks, swamps and marshes. It can be found in shallow, slow moving water. It is omnivorous. The main food for the turtle are insects, fish, tadpoles, leaves and seeds. The yellow pond turtle generally remains in or close to water during the day. It is usually more active at night. It usually goes onto land when it rains.

"Mauremys mutica kami" is one of the subspecies. It is currently found in the Ryukyu Islands. There are several hybrid Asian pond turtles species. They were first described as new species but later found out as hybrid species. Fujian pond turtles ("Mauremys iversoni") are hybrid species mainly produced in Chinese turtle farms. They are produced when female yellow pond turtles and male golden coin turtles ("Cuora trifasciata") mates.

"Clemmys guangxiensis" is a hybrid species that came from the mating of "Mauremys mutica" and the Fujian pond turtle.

The yellow pond turtle is threatened with extinction. The population in China eats the most amount of turtles in the world. This trading of turtles is the greatest threat to Asian turtles including "M. mutica". The turtles are also used in traditional Chinese medicine. There are also turtles kept as pets but are later killed or abandoned. Water pollution can also cause some habitats of the turtle be to gone. The IUCN considers" M. mutica "an endangered species.

The Cat in the Hat (movie)

The Cat in the Hat is a 2003 American family comedy movie directed by Bo Welch and based on the Dr. Seuss book of the same name.


It is considered one of the worst movies based on a children's book due to Mike Myers' performance and the raunchy humor that isn't suitable for a kids movie.

The movie was going to have a sequel based on The Cat in the Hat Comes Back with Myers and Welch returning but Audrey Geisel banned future live-action movies based on her husband's book made.

DreamWorks Pictures acquired the film rights to the original Dr. Seuss book in December 1998. However, production did not officially start until after the 2000 Christmas/comedy movie "How the Grinch Stole Christmas", by Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment, both of whom also joined to finance, distribute and produce the film with DreamWorks, and based on another Dr. Seuss book of the same name, became a commercial success. Brian Grazer, the producer of "The Grinch", stated: "Because we grew up with these books, and because they have such universal themes and the illustrations ignite such fantasy in your mind as a child—the aggregation of all those feelings—it leaves an indelible, positive memory. And so when I realized I had a chance to convert first "The Grinch" and then, "The Cat in the Hat", into movies, I was willing to do anything to bring them to the screen." Grazer then contacted Bo Welch over the phone with the offer to direct the film, and he accepted. When production began, songs written by Randy Newman were dropped because they were deemed inferior; Newman's cousin, David, instead composed the score for the film. Although Welch and a publicist for Myers denied it, several people said Myers had considerable input into the film's direction by telling some of the cast (namely co-stars Baldwin and Preston) how to perform their scenes.

Tim Allen was originally considered for the role of the Cat. The script was initially based on a version of the original book's story conceived by Allen, who admitted that as a child he was afraid of Seuss' "mischievous feline babysitter"; "My dream is to give it the edge that scared me," stated Allen. However, the studio did not commission a screenplay until late February 2001, when Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer (best known for being writers on the television series "Seinfeld") were hired by the studio to script the film (replacing the original draft of the film that was written a few years prior by Eric Roth), so the film would not be ready to shoot before the deadline. By this point, Allen was also committed to shooting Disney's "The Santa Clause 2", which was also delayed because Allen wanted a script rewrite. Due to scheduling conflicts with that film, he dropped out of the role. As a result, in March 2002 the role of the Cat was given to Mike Myers, whom Grazer had an argument with regarding a proposed film adaptation of Myers' "Saturday Night Live" sketch "Sprockets", which Myers cancelled in June 2000 after being dissatisfied with his own script for it. Myers stated in an interview that he was a long-time fan of the original Dr. Seuss book, and that it was the first book he ever read. In October 2002, Mike Myers, Dave Foley, Jay Kogen and Stephen Hibbert did an uncredited rewrites of the script.

Prior to filming, giant props for the film were stolen from the set; the local police found the props vandalized with graffiti in a shopping mall car park in Pomona, California. Despite this, no arrests had been made and filming was to start the next week. Principal photography took place mostly in California from October 7, 2002 to January 22, 2003. The neighborhood and the town center was filmed in a rural valley near Simi Valley, where 24 houses (each 26 feet square and 52 feet tall) were constructed. The downtown area outdoor shots were filmed along a Pomona street where a number of antique and gift shops are located. The community decided not to redecorate after filming ended, so the surreal paint scheme and some of the signage could still be seen today as it appears in the film. Because of so much smog in the area, the sky had to be digitally replaced with the cartoon-like sky and colors of the background had to be digitally fixed.

According to co-star Amy Hill, Myers was very difficult to work with on set, refusing to talk to anyone on the production (other than director Welch) and completely isolating himself from the cast and crew during breaks in the filming. She also noted that the film ended up having long and pointless retakes of scenes because Myers overruled Welch on whether they were good enough or not.

The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2003. Originally, Marc Shaiman was going to compose the score for the film, but due to Bruce Broughton already being chosen for the film score, Instead he wrote the film's songs with Scott Wittman. The soundtrack also features a song by Smash Mouth ("Getting Better"), which makes it the second Mike Myers-starring film in a row to feature a song by Smash Mouth, which makes it the third Mike Myers-starring film in a row to feature a song by Smash Mouth after "Shrek" and "Austin Powers in Goldmember". The trailer for the film uses a version of "Hey! Pachuco!" by the Royal Crown Revue. The soundtrack also includes two songs performed by Myers, who plays the Cat. Newman's score won a BMI Film Music Award.

The movie is set to have an animated reboot by Warner Bros.

Despite the reception, several internet memes based on the movie have become popular among fans who grew up with the movie.

Scoring (cricket)

Scoring in cricket is a way of showing how well each team did during the game; it shows which team had more runs (points), as well as sometimes showing how well each of their players did during the game.

A game of cricket is won by the team with more runs at the end of the game, so long as the team with fewer runs has completed all of its innings. In games of cricket with time limits, there can be a "draw" result, which means no team wins if not enough innings are completed on time (the follow-on is one way that teams try to stop this from happening). When a game of cricket is played with multiple innings per team, the winning team can sometimes win while batting fewer times than its opponent; how many fewer times they batted is sometimes shown in their score.

Although a team's victory is based only on runs and innings (and sometimes the time limit of the game), team scores can also show, sometimes during different innings, the number of wickets lost by (batters who are out on) a team, as well as the number of balls/deliveries (which can also be shown as overs) batted by the team. These last two things can be useful to know because in most forms of cricket, a team's innings will almost always end either when almost all players on the team are out, or in games of cricket where each team had limits on the number of legal deliveries that could be bowled to them, they have batted a certain number of legal deliveries.

Trollius laxus

The American Globeflower, "Trollius laxus" is a rare endangered species of flowering plants Native to Northeastern United States. This species of plants is  limited in range by their ability to exclusively survive in wetlands and marshes. Thus, clusters of the species are constantly threatened by the ever-changing hydrology of the range they are confined to.

"Trollius laxus" is a rare, herbaceous perennial only found in a small range of fens or wetland habitats fed by groundwater in northeastern United States. In these calcium rich fens, the "T. laxus" can be locally abundant. They can also be found in Oregon, Washington, British Columbia and the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. During spring, "T. laxus" is one of the first flowers to bloom in the Rocky Mountain. Its distribution is limited by light intensity and hydrology.

Wetlands and marshes have consistent groundwater discharge which means that water levels will typically be high in these areas. This will result in anoxia and ultimately lower the amount of nutrients present. It is thought that the plants evolved to endure these conditions so that they have less competition for sunlight. While "T. laxus" prefers these wetter conditions, the plant can also grow in drier conditions if there is enough sunlight present. Increased sunlight will increase the biomass of these plants but, there is a threshold before the plant’s growth will plateau or even decline. The combination of seasonal drying along with very high light intensities can result in the competitive exclusion of "T. laxus" . In order for "T. laxus" to meet this requirement of light intensity and hydrology, it must sacrifice the size of its range. This is a factor that causes it's distribution to be limited.

"Trollius laxus" is a perennial found predominantly in forested wetlands with cold alkaline groundwater. This plant is one of the first to flower in the spring from mid-April to early May in Connecticut, and the seeds are ripened by mid-June where they are dispersed passively with the help of wind and water.

"Trollius laxus" has few effective pollinators including the sweat bee, the Cuckoo bee, and a fly within the family Tachinidae. Molluscan herbivores such as slugs and snails can cause leaf damage impacting the overall plant community diversity. Slug predation on "T. Laxus" affects its seedling survival, as well as competition and predation due to the presence of neighboring plants and herbivores. Removing neighboring plants lowers the predation risk on "T. Laxus" and increases its growth and reproductive success.

"T. laxus" may also occur in forested wetlands so it may be well-adapted to growing under closed forest canopies. Field observations have indicated that both light and groundwater levels affect "T. laxus" plant and population vigor, and that the distribution of "T. laxus" may be limited by competition with other plants. 
"Trollius laxus" is easily identifiable by botanists due to their showy bright yellow flowers which are globular in shape. When flower is absent, other characteristics can be used to identify the plant. This herbaceous flowering plant with a one to two foot stems, thick and fibrous roots, and basal leaves. The plant can include one or more stems, each with a cream or pale yellow flower up to 5 cm in diameter with 5-7 petaloid Sepals. The actual petals are reduced to staminodes with basal nectar glands. Each leaf of "Trollius laxus" consists of five three-lobed leaflets that spread horizontally from the tip of the petiole. Each leaflet has sharp teething margins. The leaves sprout on petioles which grow from the base of the plant.

This herbaceous plant is one of the first to bloom in the spring. The flowering stalk is usually longer than the leaf stalk. The flowers are terminal, meaning the grow at the tip of the flowering stalk and each stalk has one flower. Each flower has five veiny sepals and in the center of the flower sit numerous stamens and ten to fifteen petals deep yellow or orange in color. Hidden among the petals are five or more separate fruits.

The fruit of "Trollius laxus" are dry with each follicle containing three to six seeds on average, and are formed in aggregate on the stems. The flowers of "T. laxus" range from white to yellow in color with nectar glands at the base, and can grow up to five centimeters in diameter. Both flowering and fruit level are positively correlated with light intensity, possibly due to pollinators being able to travel longer distances after leaving a warmer flower than a colder one.

Force play

In baseball, any player from the team that is trying to score who is on one of the bases (a "runner") can not be safe on that base anymore if there is another player from their team who has become unsafe at the previous base in the same way; the runner is then said to be "forced" to run. The batter can be considered as no longer being safe at home base (which can be thought of as the base that comes "before" first base) when he has hit the ball into the fair part of the field. A forceout occurs when a player on the fielding team touches a base while holding the ball and a runner at the previous base was made unsafe in this way; that runner is then out.

In other words, a runner is forced to run to the next base, with the risk of being out if an opponent holding the ball touches the next base before them, in only the following two situations:


If, during the play, a runner is gotten out, and there are other runners who are not out and currently forced to run, then any of those runners that reached a base that came after the base(s) touched by the runner that got out is no longer forced to run. This is called "removing the force".

Arkzin

Arkzin (also written as @®kz!n) is a magazine. It was started by a group of anti-war people in Zagreb, Croatia in September of 1991. It was an important new publishing house Croatia in the 1990s. "Arkzin" has been a paper magazine, a newspaper, website, and a publishing house for books and music on CDs. "Arkzin" told people to promote political change using the media. "Arzkin" was inspired by the concept of tactical media. The last issue of the magazine was published in 1999. "Arkzin" changed media and culture in Croatia and other countries.

The pilot issue was published on September 25, 1991 as fanzine of the Anti-war Campaign Croatia. The aim of the fanzine was to collect information about peace and anti-war initiatives in (post)Yugoslavia, advocate nonviolence and a peaceful solution for the emerging war, report on human rights abuses, support conscientious objectors and serve as an alternative political media platform. As Vesna Janković wrote in the editorial of the pilot issue: The quality of the Anti-war campaign lies in the multitude and diversity of initiatives that make it up. Arkzin will nurture this diversity and thus be an active contribution to the emergence of civil society, a society of peace, pluralism, tolerance and diversity. Contributors were mostly members of the anti-war groups. The first edition had six issues (double issues: 2-3 and 5-6), with the last issue appearing on May 7th 1992. Circulation grew from 500 to 2,000 copies in A4 format. "Arkzin" was distributed through post mail, from hand to hand etc. Publishing costs were covered by donations collected by European peace groups.

The second edition of "Arkzin" ran for 93 issues, the first of which appeared on April 1st 1992. Initially a monthly, starting from the issue 13, "Arkzin" became a bi-weekly. In the second phase, "Arkzin" changed its format to A3, broadened the editorial board and scope of topics, included professional journalists as contributors (many of them could not publish in mainstream newspapers any more because of tightening censorship efforts by the state at the time). It was printed in newspaper rotation and distributed through a national newspaper stands network. Circulation grew from 2.000 to 10.000 copies. During this period "Arkzin" gradually changed to a hybrid magazine in which politics, culture, theory and art met and inspired one another. Throughout its life as a newspaper, "Arkzin" changed its conceptual self-definition, changing from the “Magazine of the Anti-War Campaign Croatia” (no. 10, February 1994), “Megazine of the Anti-War Campaign Croatia” (no. 12, April 1994) , “Metazine for Civil Society Politics and Culture” (no. 66, 7 June 1996), “Memezine for Civil Society Politics and Culture” (no. 73, 13 September 1996). Starting with the issue no. 82 (January 17, 1997) the cover page masthead no longer said ‘Arkzin’ in the Roman alphabet, but rather in Japanese katakana. In words of Dejan Kršić, graphic designer and one of the editors of "Arkzin": "This development reflects the role that Arkzin plays in the context of the movement for peace, non-violence, human rights, women’s power and ecology on one side, and the efforts of a growing range of people to build a cultural environment, which resists not only the war and its consequences but also the strangling grip of the dominant nationalist forces in Croatia, on the other side. Arkzin has established itself as a major forum of independent, alternative, critical information and debate. Arkzin not only criticises the government policies (e. g. the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the evictions of the people from former Yugoslav army housing flats), but also examines the role of the media, of the intellectuals and of various marginalised youth subcultures." (note published on Bibliofil) 

The third, and final, phase of "Arkzin" lasted from 1997 until 1998. During this period seven issues in total were published. The format, number of pages and printing technique were changed, along with the content. The most professional journalist left the magazine at the time. Articles published were more theoretical, reflective, focused on broader analysis, avoiding everyday political issues. Some critics (see Veljak, Lino "Civil Society and Politics in Croatia") believe that in this period, "Arkzin" lost its political edge and became a theoretical-artistic experiment.

Although it had appointed editors-in-chief at various times, in practice "Arkzin" functioned as an editorial collective. Each issue was planned jointly at editorial meetings, which consisted of a core of permanent contributors. As Bojan Bilić writes in the text Islands of Print Media Resistance: ARKzin and Republika:Moreover, although Vesna Janković was the longest serving editor-in-chief, the publication did not have editorial staff in the classical sense of the term. Those who gathered around ARKzin were more interested in devising inclusive and non-hierarchical editorial strategies. Different people wrote and oversaw editorials at different points in time. In addition, collective authorship was experimented with in Arkzin: numerous texts, especially programmatic ones, were co-written by two or three authors. The most famous was a series of 30 editorials entitled "Was ist Arkzin" published in 1996-1997 and signed as the Bastard Intellectual Cooperative.

Arkzin was known not just for its radical political content, but also for its radical graphic design created by Dejan Kršić and Dejan Dragosavac Ruta. In his analysis of Dejan Dragosavac Ruta's graphic design of different magazines An Anatomy of Ruta's Magazines and Journals, Maroje Mrduljaš wrote: "Arkzin's radical deconstructivist aesthetics and the magazine's strongly emphasized "visuality" are based on typography research and the deposition of graphic and content layers, and the original approach the authors continually developed stemmed from experience, mainstream media and popular culture, and more "esoteric" sources: Neville Brody, via David Carson, to Emigre. /.../ Typographic interpretations and the creation of unexpected connections between different contents, working with information structures of "timelines" indicate a research approach to the structure of the magazine as a whole and the text, questioning the very act of reading."

Arkzin’s distinctive design resonated well especially with younger audiences and activists, leading to a number of cultural and media initiatives turning to Arkzin’s designers for help in visually shaping their promotional materials and political messages. The fact that designers often did not charge for their services certainly contributed to this. The above-mentioned interview with Dejan Dragosavac Rutta states the following:"He designed and graphically edited a number of magazines and journals: Arkzin, Nomad, Godine nove, Libra libera, Gordogan, Up&underground, Civilno društvo.hr, Frakcija, etc. His clients are mostly present in the field of culture and civil-society scene: Multimedia Institute, Kontejner – bureau of contemporary art praxis, Platforma 9.81, Eurøkaz, SKD Prosvjeta, Oceanmore, British Council, the initiative Pravo na grad, for which he designs catalogues, books, promotional materials, campaigns, etc."In parallel with the increased engagement, Arkzin's graphic editors publicly thematized the social responsibility of art and design, reaffirming some of the repressed names of Croatian engaged design, such as Mirko Ilić and .

Arkzin's graphic design also received international acclaim when the Print magazine, American Bimonthly for Visual Culture and Design named him one of the world's most important magazines from 1936-2001 in Perrin Drumm's article "Eight Years that Changed Magazine Design History" (Print magazine, January 2010, New York). Arkzin was included in a passage about the year 1993 and the beginnings of a new digital culture.

First book published by Arkzin was "Culture of Lies: Antipolitical Essays" written by Dubravka Ugrešić, in 1996. Since then Arkzin has published 38 books. Of these, 13 books were published in Arkzin's own Bibliotheque Bastard, and 15 books were co-published in cooperation with various small independent publishers from Croatia and from Serbia (B92) and Bosnia and Hercegovina (Dani).

Editorial policy follows the theoretical and political orientation outlined in the newspaper: fierce critique of nationalism and capitalism, in step with promotion of Marxism and psychoanalisys (which was by then completely cast out of the mainstream Croatian intellectual circles). In that line Arkzin has published translations of famous titles written by contemporary leftist/marxist authors like Alain Badiou, Guy Debord, Louis Althusser, Fredric Jameson or Slavoj Žižek. In addition to translations, Arkzin publishes Croatian and regional authors known for their critical reflection on the (post) war reality of the former Yugoslav states. Among others, in 1997 the novel Maria Częstohowska still shedding tears or Dying in Toronto by Daša Drndić, who later became award-winning literary author.

In 1998 Arkzin launched its music label Carnival Tunes "Independent label for good music - since 1998". Over a period of three years six music CDs were released under this label. In cooperation with Kekere Akvarium, another Croatian undergound music label, Arkzin released one more music CD in 2000. It was double album by Milan Manojlović "Man from Katanga/ Blue Bar".

Inspired by the idea of tactical media Arkzin actively supported grassroots media and cultural initiatives by promoting them in the magazine or helping them with graphic design of their promotional materials. Often, members of Arkzin editorial board took active role in lounching some of these initiatives. Here are the most significant:

Autonomous Culture Factory Attack

Curatorial collective What, How & for Whom/WHW is a curatorial collective based out of Zagreb, Croatia. Its members are curators Ivet Curlin, Ana Dević, Nataša Ilić, Sabina Sabolović, and the designer and publicist Dejan Kršić. As they stated in an interview for X-TRA, contemporary art journal:Especially influential for WHW forming was "Arkzin", which started in 1991 as the fanzine of the Antiwar Campaign of Croatia and later became a publishing house. "Arkzin" was a major forum (virtually the only one for a couple of years) for independent and alternative critical information and debate. In 1998, when they published a 150th anniversary edition of the "Communist Manifesto" by Marx and Engels, edited by Boris Buden with an introduction by Slavoj Žižek, they approached one of us to organize a contemporary art exhibition that they hoped would trigger a timely public debate on the issues the Manifesto might raise in Croatia. Organizing an exhibition on the "Communist Manifesto" immediately seemed to have the potential to intervene in the field of art on all levels, in terms of content, obviously, and in terms of organizational know-how, as well as in terms of assessing and building local and international contexts. The goal of these interventions was to oppose an individualistic understanding of cultural work. (interviewed by Michelle Dizon, X-TRA, Spring 2010, Volume 12 Number 3).



Scotty Doesn't Know

"Scotty Doesn't Know" is a song from the 2004 sex comedy movie "EuroTrip" written and performed by the band Lustra. It is about the lead singer having an affair with Fiona and Scotty doesn't know that.

Scotty Doesn't Know was originally from Fathers' Day Starring Billy Crystal and the late Robn Williams, performed by Mark McGrath of band Sugar Ray

In the movie, Donny (played by Matt Damon) sang this song at the graduation party. Matt Damon doesn't sing the song but his singing voice was done by the lead of Lustra. The song became an important part of the movie, where it became a famous club song at Bratislava and became a ringtone.

The song was put on a loop in Scott Morrison's website by a hacker in October 2018 to criticize Morrison's actions.

Goldendoodle

A Goldendoodle is a type of dog that is mixed breed from a poodle and a golden retriever.

A Golden doodle is a mixed breed between a poodle and a golden retriever, so the appearances may vary. An average Golden doodle is 23 to 29 inches long in height. Golden doodles come out with long muzzles, and dark, oval shaped eyes which mostly brown, but can rarely be light blue or grassy green. Golden doodles have a cute coat. The coat can be golden, cream, white, or even red!

Golden doodles are a high-maintenance breed. They will need to be professionally groomed every 8 to 12 weeks. A Golden doodle needs at least 15 to 30 minutes of exercise three times a day. When a puppy, they tend to want to play interactive games like fetch, but as they grow older, they enjoy a gentle stroll. Haircuts are necessary for Golden doodles every six weeks. This will keep the fur from tangles or matting. Make sure to take your Golden doodle out every 45-60 minutes.

Golden doodle puppies need to be fed 4 small meals a day. When your puppy grows up to 6 months old, you can feed the golden doodle larger meals twice a day.

Golden doodles are an energetic breed, so training will be much harder. To sit: Hold a treat up in the air over the Golden’s head until it sits. Reward the dog with the treat. To lay down: While the dog is sitting, hold a treat in your hand and wave your free hand up and down while beckoning the dog to lay down. Reward the Golden with the treat when it lays down.

Golden doodles usually cost around $500 to $4000 depending on where you pick up the pup. Basic dry kibble costs $100-$250 per year. Premium dog kibble will cost around $200-$400 per year. For maintenance, smaller golden doodles cost less than bigger golden doodles. For grooming, you will pay around $50 to $80 every 8 weeks.

Golden doodles live around 10-15 years. This life span is inherited from the poodle and golden retriever parents. Many Golden doodles die from a heart disease called sub valvular aortic stenosis, which can be avoided by working out your dog with cardiac exercises. Golden doodles were first bred in the United States. Golden doodles were at first meant to be guide dogs, but they gained popularity and became pets.

Rude Removal

"Rude Removal" is an episode of "Dexter's Laboratory" that was supposed to air on 1998 but didn't air because of the swearing used in the episode. It later aired on Adult Swim in 2013, although censored.

Dexter has made a Rude Removal machine to remove the rudeness from Dee Dee. They argued on who is the rudest.

Kirby's Dream Course

Kirby's Dream Course is a pinball video game that was developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo in 1993. It is for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

"Kirby's Dream Course" is a mini golf video game. The art is in an isometric perspective, similar to games like "Marble Madness". Its plot involves Kirby's enemy King Dedede stealing all of the stars in the night sky. Kirby sets out to stop Dedede and return the stars to the sky.

Players move Kirby (or in the case of player two, a yellow Kirby look-alike named ) around a miniature golf course by bouncing him towards a specific area of the playfield. Players must set the power, angle, and spin to hit various enemies found throughout the levels, which earns the player a star. When only one enemy remains, that enemy transforms into the goal hole, which is worth two stars. In multiplayer, two players try to get the most stars. A player can hit a star claimed by the other player to take it. Kirby/Keeby can knock himself into certain enemies to get a Copy Ability, which can be used to clear courses more quickly or hurt the other player. These Copy abilities include Kirby/Keeby turning into a tornado, a sparking ball that can break certain obstacles, and a UFO that allows Kirby/Keeby to float and move at will for a short time.

The game has eight single-player courses, with eight holes in each. Completing courses awards the player with medals, which can be used to unlock extra features such as different versions of courses. The type of medal awarded is based on how well the player performed, with gold being the best.

"Kirby's Dream Course" was made by HAL Laboratory and Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). HAL originally made the game as a new game called "Special Tee Shot" in 1992. It had its own characters and art. The game was given several previews from magazines and was displayed on the packaging for the console, but the company stopped working on it because their "Kirby" series on the Game Boy was very successful. HAL later turned "Special Tee Shot" into a "Kirby" game by replacing many of the original characters with those from the "Kirby" series, and adding some mechanics to make it more like other games in the series.

Keeby, the yellow Kirby that the second player controls, reuses Shigeru Miyamoto's idea for what color Kirby should be, which was replaced with pink by the time "Kirby's Adventure" released. After an unnamed yellow Kirby appeared in "", a yellow color appeared a lot when more than one player played as Kirby in the "Kirby" and "Super Smash Bros." series. This design was called "Keeby Yellow" in "Kirby's Dream Buffet".

"Kirby's Dream Course" was released in Japan on September 21, 1994, as "Kirby Ball". It was released in North America on February 1, 1995, and in Europe later in the year. "Special Tee Shot" was later released in 1996 for the Satellaview, which is a peripheral for the Super Famicom that used satellite broadcasts to play games. "Dream Course" is one of thirty games included in the Super NES Classic Edition miniconsole.

In 1995, Nintendo and HAL started making a sequel named "Kirby Ball 64"/"Kirby Bowl 64" for the Nintendo 64. A playable demo of the game was shown at Nintendo's annual Shoshinkai event. "Kirby Ball 64"/"Kirby Bowl 64" was made to use the system's analog stick to let the player move with more precision. It was going to use gouraud shading for its graphics. It also had an extra gamemode where the player controlled Kirby on a snowboard. "Kirby Ball 64" was never released, but some of the ideas from the game were later used in "Kirby Air Ride".

People liked "Kirby's Dream Course" for its weirdness and innovation. "GamePro" writer Scary Larry claimed it was just as fun to play as the other "Kirby" games. A writer for "Next Generation" found the mini golf gameplay system unique compared to other games, as did a reviewer from "Electronic Gaming Monthly". "Next Generation" and Larry also highlighted "Dream Course"s complexity, which was not common for a golf game at the time. The game's colorful art was liked for its funny design. "Electronic Gaming Monthly" said that the game's controls took a while to get used to. Larry said that the accuracy of the player's shots was not well-refined. Tom Guise of "Computer and Video Games" believed its originality made it one of the best SNES games, which "Electronic Gaming Monthly" agreed with. Javier Abad, a reviewer for "Nintendo Acción", said that "Kirby" fans would enjoy it for the controls and art style.

People have also said good things about the game in retrospective reviews. Staff from "Nintendo Life" compared its silliness to Electronic Arts' "Zany Golf". They said that it had fun gameplay and a good difficulty level. They also believed that its graphics looked good. "IGN"s Lucas M. Thomas believed "Dream Course"s unique concept made it impossible to compare it to other games. Thomas and "GameSpot"s Frank Provo both enjoyed how useful the power-ups were. "USgamer" writer Nadia Oxford liked its unusual level design and funny design, and said it offered a break from the more action-oriented games on the console. IGN ranked the game 38th on their "Top 100 SNES Games of All Time."

Blueberries, bananas, eggs, salmon are good examples to feed your cat Birman, as they can be quite the picky eaters. It is advised to feed your Birman: dental grade cat biscuits, raw chicken bones, cooked fish and chicken. High quality of canned foods can be fed to the cat regularly but you might want to be careful because you need to consist healthy proteins and cooked foods to make sure your Birman's needs have been met. 

Feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common problem seen in cats, and is a threat to Birman cats too. The Birman breed also has problems with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a disease that causes heart failure and cardiac arrest. Their average lifespan is about 9-15 years.

Birman cats are said to have originated in Burma, and there was treated like a sacred cat. A story was made, “Originally, the guardians of the Temple of LaoTsun were yellow-eyed white cats with long hair. The golden goddess of the temple, Tsun-Kyan-Kse, had deep blue eyes. The head priest, Mun-Ha, had as his companion a beautiful cat named Sinh. One day the temple was attacked and Mun-Ha was killed. At the moment of his death, Sinh placed his feet on his master. The cat’s white fur took on a golden cast; his eyes turned as blue as the eyes of the goddess, and his face, legs and tail became the color of earth. However, his paws, where they touched the priest, remained white as a symbol of purity. All the other temple cats became similarly colored. Seven days later, Sinh died, taking the soul of Mun-Ha to paradise.”

Foul ball

In baseball, a foul ball is any hit ball that goes in foul territory, which is the area of the field not in between the bases (when looking from home plate to the pitcher's mound), without first going beyond the bases nearest to home plate, or being touched by a player, umpire, or an object not part of the ground while on or over fair territory (which is the part of the field that is not foul territory). 

Each foul ball is a strike against the batter, except when this would result in the batter being struck out. The batting team can not score on a foul ball unless the batter flies out.

Other bat-and-ball games have things that are similar to foul balls. For example, some forms of street cricket, like bete-ombro, penalize the batter if the ball goes behind them, which gives the batter 180 degrees of fair playing area, rather than the 90 degrees of fair playing area in baseball.

There are several artefacts found in the site. They include redware from the Pre Harappan era. These redware are terracotta jar, plates, racks for plates and others. These made up of 15% to 25% of total artefacts found.

Important artefacts found are broken fragments of pots having the writing system of Harappan people craved into them. There is also one unfinished seal of the Harappan government found in the ruins.

The dig is done on a small, restricted scale. There are no specific structures that could be exposed. One exception is a collapsed rubble wall-like structure.

Later on, some stores were opened in front of the temple. These stores are still in front of the temple right now.

The buildings on the land of the temple are not the original ones when the temple was first created. Many of the gates and art have been created again after their destruction.

A legend from the area says that in the 7th century, some fishermen found a gold statuette of Kannon. The statuette was caught in their fishing nets on the Sumida River. Sensō-ji was built so that people could worship the statuette. The land that Sensō-ji is on used to have a very big Buddhist temple in the 8th century.

The gate that is in front of the temple right now is not the same one that used to be used. The first gate was created in 941 (during the Heian period) and was burned down in a fire in 1865. After Konosuke Matsushita gave money for it to be built again, a new gate was built in 1960.

The is the other big gate of Sensō-ji. It is closer to the temple than the Kaminarimon. The gate has two storeys (called a nijūmon in Japanese). Inside the gate, many important objects are kept there.

On the left and the right side of the gate, two very big sandals that are made of straw (called "ōwaraji", or "big waraji") are hung. They are both long, wide, and have a weight of . New sandals are made every 10 years by people from Tateokāramachi, a neighbourhood in Murayama, Yamagata. The eighth pair of sandals was made in 2018. The ōwaraji are hung there to protect the temple from evil. They are supposed to show how powerful the statues of Nio in the Hōzōmon are. The first ōwaraji were from 1941. The tradition comes from Toshizo Matsuoka, who was a part of the House of Representatives of Japan. He gave some straw sandals to the temple.

The is a street in front of the temple. Around the street are many small stores that sell souvenirs and food. The street is long and has 89 shops.

Algebraic number

A real or complex number is called an algebraic number if it is a solution of some one-variable polynomial equation whose coefficients are all integers. All rational numbers are algebraic numbers, along with some irrational numbers. For example, the golden ratio formula_1 is a solution to the equation formula_2. A real or complex number that is not algebraic is called transcendental.

While this is an abstract notion, theoretical mathematics has potentially far-reaching applications in communications and computer science, especially in data encryption and security.

Tandoori chicken

Tandoori chicken is a chicken dish originating in the Indian subcontinent. It is prepared by roasting chicken marinated in yogurt and spices. It is prepared in the "tandoor", a cylindrical clay oven. The dish started from the Indian subcontinent. It is popular in many other parts of the world. Tandoori chicken can be served with other dishes, such as naan or rice.

The dishes like tandoori chicken may have started during in the Harappan civilization. According to famous archeologist and vice-chancellor of Deccan College Professor Vasant Shinde, the earliest proof for a dish like tandoori chicken can be found in the Harappan civilization in 3000 BC. His team has found ancient ovens at Harappan sites which are similar to the tandoors that are used in the state of Punjab. Physical remains of chicken bones have also been found along with burn marks. According to Sushruta Samhita, the meat was cooked in an oven (kandu) after marinating it in spices like black mustard (rai) powder and fragrant spices. According to Ahmed (2014), Harappan oven structures may have operated in a similar manner to the modern tandoors of the Punjab.

Tandoori chicken started in the Punjab as a dish. It started before the partition of India. In the late 1940s, tandoori chicken was made popular by Kundan Lal Jaggi and Kundan Lal Gujral at Moti Mahal in Daryaganj, New Delhi. They were Punjabi Hindus as well as the founders of the Moti Mahal restaurant. Mokha Singh had founded the restaurant in the Peshawar area of British India. It is now part of neighboring Pakistan.

In the United States, tandoori chicken started appearing on menus by the 1960s. It is reported that Jacqueline Kennedy ate "chicken tandoori" on a flight from Rome to Bombay in 1962. A recipe for tandoori chicken was printed on the "Los Angeles Times" in 1963, for "the hostess in search of a fresh idea for a party dinner"; a similar recipe was published in the same newspaper in 1964.

Henet

Henet or the Pelican is an Ancient Egyptian goddess. She has to do with pelicans. The Pyramid Texts talk about Henet.

The Pelican ("Henet" in Egyptian) is shown on the walls of tombs of people from the Pharaoh's court. Henet is in scenes of farm animals. Henet is in royal funerary texts from the Pyramid Age as a protective symbol against snakes. The description of the Pelican falling into the Nile seems connected with the idea that dangerous things are disguised as fish, and the pelican will capture them in its large beak. This is similar to the dragnets and bird nets used for trapping sinners in the Underworld. Scholars think that Henet is a goddess because she is called "mother of the king" in the Pyramid Texts. In ancient Egypt, that only meant a goddess.

In non-royal funerary papyri the Pelican can predict safe travel for a dead person in the Underworld. The open beak of the Pelican is also associated with the ability of the deceased to leave the burial chamber and go out into the rays of the sun, possibly an analogy made between the long cavernous beak of the pelican and the tomb shaft.

The Petrograd Soviet is a group of workers founded by Soviets during the Russian revolution.

2024 United States presidential election

The 2024 United States presidential election will be the 60th quadrennial presidential election. The election is scheduled to be held on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, along with other state and federal elections. It will be the first presidential election to use population information from the 2020 census.

President Joe Biden has officially announced he is running for reelection to a second term.

Former President Donald Trump has also announced he is running for reelection to a non-consecutive term.

The winner of the 2024 presidential election will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025.

Article Two of the United States Constitution states that for a person to serve as president, the person must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have been a United States resident for at least 14 years. The Twenty-second Amendment prevents anyone from being elected president more than twice.

The "Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization" decision in June 2022, which overturned the 1973 "Roe v. Wade" decision and permitted U.S. states to fully ban abortion for the first time in nearly 50 years, has made abortion a likely issue. In the 2024 election, the topic of abortion is expected to play a major role in the Republican Party.

Due to more mass shootings in the United States, President Biden has advocated a ban of assault weapons. This is most likely a major campaign topic to play out in both parties.

Joe Biden is the current president, elected for his first term in office in the 2020 election, and has said he plans to run for a second term in 2024. He is the oldest president, at age 78, and would be 82 at the end of his first term and 86 at the end of his second term, if reelected.

If Biden is reelected, he will be term limited by the Twenty-second amendment and cannot run for reelection to a third term in 2028.

During late 2021, as President Biden had low approval ratings in the polls, there was peculation that he would not run for reelection. If this happened, Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg would be considered likely candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, having both run for president in 2020. However, Biden has said he has every intention of running for reelection.

In March 2023, author and 2020 presidential candidate Marianne Williamson announced her presidential campaign, challenging Biden. In April 2023, environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced his challenge to Biden, becoming the second Democratic challenger to Biden. On April 25, 2023, President Joe Biden announced he was running for re-election with Vice President Kamala Harris as his running mate.

In October 2023, Kennedy Jr. announced he would be withdrawing from the Democratic primary to run an Independent campaign for president. A few weeks later, U.S. Representative from Minnesota Dean Phillips announced his candidacy on October 26, 2023. Spiritual author Marianne Williamson ended her campaign on February 7, 2024.

The Democratic National Convention will be held in Chicago, Illinois at the United Center between August 19 to August 22, 2024.

Donald Trump was defeated by Joe Biden in 2020 and was impeached by the House of Representatives. He was found not guilty in his second impeachment in 2021 and is currently able to run again in the 2024. If he decides to run, he would be seeking to become the second president, after Grover Cleveland, to serve two non-consecutive terms, potentially making him both the 45th and 47th president of the United States.

Although after the January 6 insurrection may have severely damaged his public opinion about him. House Democrats may use the Fourteenth Amendment to prevent Trump from being eligible to run again. If Trump succeeds and wins the republican nomination, he would be the first president since Richard Nixon to win his party's nomination three times in a row.

The last president to run after leaving office was Theodore Roosevelt, who came in second in the 1912 election as the candidate of the Progressive Party, although Herbert Hoover did seek the Republican nomination at national conventions after leaving office in 1933.

In early October 2023, Hurd and Stapleton withdrew from their candidacies with Hurd supporting Haley. By the end of the month, Johnson and Elder suspended their campaigns and endorsed Trump, whereas Pence dropped out without supporting anyone. On November 12, Senator Tim Scott ended his campaign after having low polling numbers. On December 4, Burgum ended his campaign after low polling numbers and failing to qualify for the last two debates.

On January 10, 2024, a week before the Iowa caucus, former Governor Chris Christie ended his campaign, after Trump critics urged him to drop out to help Nikki Haley in the New Hampshire primary. Following Trump's win in the Iowa caucus on January 15, 2024, Vivek Ramaswamy ended his campaign and endorsed Trump, whereas former Governor Asa Hutchinson ended his campaign the following day and endorsed Healey. On January 21, Governor Ron DeSantis ended his campaign and endorsed Trump. On February 27, pastor Ryan Binkley ended his campaign and endorsed Trump.

Enron scandal

The Enron scandal was an accounting scandal of Enron Corporation, which was an American energy company. It caused the company to go bankrupt in 2001 after people found out about the scandal. The company Arthur Andersen also ended because of it, as they did not audit the company correctly. Arthur Andersen was one of the five largest audit companies in the world. Enron was often said to be the worst audit failure in history.

Enron's shareholders filed a lawsuit of $40 billion after the stock price of the company went from US$90.75 to less than $1 in November 2001. This meant the shareholders lost almost all of their money. Dynegy tried to buy Enron for a low price, but this didn't work so Enron went bankrupt on December 2, 2001 under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. This was the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history at $63.4 billion in assets. This was not passed until the WorldCom scandal in 2002.

Many executives at Enron were arrested for many charges and some were later sent to prison. Arthur Andersen was found guilty of illegally destroying documents relevant to the SEC investigation. This voided its license to audit public companies and almost closed the firm. By the time the ruling was overturned at the U.S. Supreme Court, Arthur Andersen lost many of its customers and stopped operating. Enron employees and shareholders received limireturns in lawsuits, despite losing billions in pensions and stock prices.

As a consequence of the scandal, new regulations and legislation were passed to expand the accuracy of financial reporting for public companies. The Sarbanes–Oxley Act increased penalties for destroying, altering, or making up records in federal investigations or for attempting to defraud shareholders. The act also increased the accountability of auditing firms to remain unbiased and independent of their clients.

Malcolm &amp; Marie

Malcolm & Marie is an American drama movie, written and directed by Sam Levinson. It stars John David Washington and Zendaya as the title characters.

It was released on February 5, 2021, by Netflix.

Writer-director Malcolm Elliott (John David Washington) returns home from his film premiere with his girlfriend Marie Jones (Zendaya). Malcolm eagerly anticipates the critical reviews following the emotional audience response from the screening. When he notices Marie looking displeased, he urges her to tell him what is bothering her. Initially reluctant to start a fight in the middle of the night, she tells him that she is upset that she was not thanked or acknowledged in his speech at the premiere.

Marie believes that she is the basis of his film, a drama about a struggling black female drug addict named Imani, as she herself was a drug addict when they met. Malcolm dismisses her accusations, claiming that Imani is not based on her and is an amalgamation of different people. Marie insists that he would not have authentically portrayed Imani's struggles with drug abuse and addiction if they were not together. Malcolm believes that Marie is overreacting, claiming that, because she quit acting years ago, she is jealous of the actress who played Imani and that she is projecting her personal problems on him and his film. Marie affirms her position on his lack of acknowledgment and calls his talents "mediocre". While Marie is taking a bath, Malcolm describes to her the different women he had relationships with, who inspired the character of Imani, stating that only Imani's feelings of hopelessness were based on Marie. After drying herself from the bath, she responds by playing Dionne Warwick's song "Get Rid of Him" on her phone, while the two are sitting silently outside.

Heading back inside, Malcolm then finds and reads the first critic review posted about his film. Despite the review being positive, he rants about the white female critic's political interpretation of his film as he did not intend it to be political. He laments that film critics are focusing too much on his black male identity and projecting politics into their interpretations, rather than judging him for his own merits. Marie playfully belittles his angry reaction to the positive review and his inability to take criticism, before the two appear to be bonding again following their arguments.

Before the two can begin to have sex, Marie provokes him when she asks why he did not cast her as Imani, believing that she would have brought a vulnerability and authenticity to the character that could have made the film better. After they angrily accuse each other of being egotistical, Marie then brings out a knife and acts out a scene as Imani to demonstrate authenticity, scaring but impressing Malcolm over how convincing she is. The two go to their bedroom and argue once more, until Marie lectures him about him taking her for granted and his lack of acknowledgement of how their genuine love for each other inspired the film.

Their arguing finally stops as they go to bed without saying anything to each other, only thanking each other before they sleep. Malcolm wakes up alone in bed in the morning daylight. He finds Marie alone outside and joins her as they look across the distance, leaving the fate of their relationship unknown.


In September 2020, Netflix bought the movie's distribution rights for $30 million, paying a higher price than companies such as HBO, A24 and Searchlight Pictures. The film was released on February 5, 2021.

Battle cruiser

A battlecruiser was like a battleship. It had thinner armor and lighter guns and was longer and less wide. They were faster than battleships, which meant they were made to go faster than bigger ships and chase down smaller ships. 
Battlecruisers were used in the 20th century. The Royal Navy invented the battlecruiser, and soon later they were used by many countries around the world. They have been replaced with more modern ships which means they are no longer used. Battleships and battlecruisers are not used today because guided cruise missiles are much better than the guns battleships and battlecruisers had.

Cruiser

A cruiser is a warship larger than a destroyer originally made to be capital ships during the World War I and II era, but nowadays they are used for a number of roles. They are most commonly used as command ships, but it is hard to give them a specific role, since most ships nowadays, apart from aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships, have very similar roles and sizes. Some of the cruiser's roles include launching many kinds of missiles, standoff, communications and command, bombardment, escorting other ships, and special operations. However, many modern ships also do this, with the main difference being size, firepower, and their intended use. This is because naval technology today that is capable of competing with other ships and winning, is very limited. The same was true in World War II, when most ships were built around big guns and speed. In both times, ships with different technology are considered obsolete or impractical and are not used much. 

Older cruisers were called battlecruisers. They used large cannons like most other ships when they were first used but have evolved to use the same weapons and technology as modern destroyers. Cruisers were first built around 1915 but became popular among navies in the early 1930s and are still used today. Cruisers have changed over time and have evolved from the old, large, coal-driven ships to the modern smaller, stealthier, and more efficient vessels. Cruisers are still used today but are very different from the older ones. After battleships stopped being used during the Cold War years, due to being designed around large guns, which by then were beginning to be considered obsolete, cruisers were left as the most powerful surface combatant ship. (Not counting aircraft carriers.) Like with most ships, they are most likely to become stealthier, more efficient, and have more advanced weapons in the foreseeable future.

GBU-43/B MOAB

The GBU-43/B Massive Ordinance Air Blast, (also known as Mother of All Bombs or MOAB) is a large yield bomb, said to be the most powerful non-nuclear bomb in the U.S arsenal. It was first made in 2003 and still is used today by the USA. It was first deployed on an enemy cave complex in Afghanistan.

The GBU-43/B MOAB is a thermobaric weapon, which means it's packed with a very fine explosive powder that gets ejected out of the bombshell when the bomb has reached its target. This fine powder then is ejected into a big cloud of powder, which mixes with the air, oxidizing the explosive powder. Then, the oxidized fuel mix gets ignited, producing a very large explosion. Thermobaric weapons carry only fuel instead of fuel and oxidizer, like other bombs do, since oxygen is already in the atmosphere. Only carrying fuel allows for a much bigger explosion with the same bomb size. Some thermobaric weapons are so powerful that they are similar to small nuclear weapons in terms of explosion size and intensity.

Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method

The Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method is a way of measuring the value of the runs scored by both teams in a limited overs cricket game when one team's scoring turn is made shorter than the other team's scoring turn because the game has been shortened midway (such as due to a rain delay). 

For example, if one team bats for 100 deliveries in their scoring turn, and then rain stops the game, the time remaining in the game may only allow the second team to receive a maximum of 50 deliveries. Therefore the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method is used to calculate a fair target for the second team considering the reduced remaining deliveries in the game. 

The DLS formula also looks at the number of batters that are out on a team when re-calculating the target score for the team batting second.

Fielding (cricket)

In cricket, one team puts all of its players in the field and tries to stop the other team from scoring. These players in the field are called fielders, and they can get the other team's players out by hitting a wicket with the ball when the other team's players are not in the batsman's ground of the wicket.

Fielders can stand anywhere in the field, and there are many names for the different parts of the field they can stand in. Most of the names are based on what angle the fielder stands away from the batter (it also depends on whether the batter is left-handed or right-handed), and how far away they are from the batter.

Some common fielding positions are the wicketkeeper and the bowler.

Sequential proportional approval voting

Sequential proportional approval voting (SPAV) is a way of electing candidates that gives proportional representation. It combines approval voting and the highest averages method. 

SPAV elects the candidate who would win an election in Approval voting (ignoring any candidates that were already elected), and then reduces the power of voters who voted for that candidate. This repeats until there are as many elected candidates as necessary. 

The strength of a voter's vote after a candidate they voted for wins is equal to (1/m+1), with m being the number of candidates the voter supported that have won so far. For example, a voter who voted for 2 candidates that won and 3 that did not has only 1/3rd of their vote power remaining.

Highest averages method

It works by looking at the number of votes that political parties have and giving seats to each party when a party can "average" more votes for each seat it gets than any other party. The D'Hondt method and the Webster method are two common highest average methods.

Quan Chi

Quan Chi is a character from the "Mortal Kombat" franchise.

Quan Chi is a nefarious free-roaming sorcerer and necromancer who is one of the Mortal Kombat series' main villains. He is first seen in MK Mythologies when he hires both Sub-Zero and his rival Scorpion to find a map leading to the amulet in hopes that they would meet in combat; indeed, Sub-Zero kills Scorpion in battle, after which Quan Chi eliminates Scorpion's Shirai Ryu clan and sends Sub-Zero to find the amulet, which is later revealed to be a fake while Quan Chi kept the real one for himself. After reviving Scorpion as an undead revenant, Quan Chi tells him that Sub-Zero was responsible for the deaths of his clan and family. He makes his playable debut in Mortal Kombat 4, in which he joins forces with disgraced Elder God Shinnok, who had been banished to the Netherealm by the thunder god Raiden after centuries of warring, in ruling the realm. He is the title character along with Shang Tsung in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance (2002), in which he brokers a deal with Shang Tsung for his assistance in reviving the army of Onaga (the game's final boss) in exchange for souls that would preserve Shang Tsung's youth, then eliminate evil Outworld emperor Shao Kahn and the perennial Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang. They kill Raiden's Earthrealm defenders, but the partnership dissolves when Shang Tsung attempts to steal Shinnok's amulet to take control of Onaga's army for himself. In his futile attempt to stop Onaga, Raiden sacrifices himself by triggering a violent explosion and seemingly killing the Deadly Alliance as well. In Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (2006), Quan Chi attempts to acquire the godlike power of the elemental Blaze. During the battle royal among the combatants on the Pyramid of Argus in the game's opening cinematic sequence, Quan Chi wounds Kenshi in battle before Shang Tsung (disguised as Ermac) throws him off the pyramid. In the game's training mode, Quan Chi suggests that he, Shang Tsung, Shao Kahn, and Onaga work together to defeat the forces of good, but is secretly serving as a double agent for Shinnok.

After Raiden reset the timeline in Mortal Kombat (2009), Quan Chi is present at the Shaolin Tournament from the outset, with the resurrected Scorpion serving as his personal assassin. They join forces in the tournament to face the Shaolin monk Liu Kang, but both are defeated. During the second tournament in Shao Kahn's Outworld arena, Quan Chi and Shang Tsung join forces against Kung Lao but are defeated. In the retold events of Mortal Kombat 3 therein, Quan Chi revives the deceased Queen Sindel (as an undead minion) in order to enable Shao Kahn to invade Earthrealm, after having resurrected the dead elder Sub-Zero — killed by Scorpion in the first tournament — as the wraith Noob Saibot to assist him in his plans. He later constructs a Soulnado to take every soul on Earth, but his plans are thwarted by Nightwolf. After Sindel massacres the Earthrealm warriors assembled to stop Shao Kahn's takeover, Raiden seeks cooperation between Earth and the Netherealm by offering Quan Chi their souls as compensation, but Quan Chi has transformed them into his revenant slaves. However, he inadvertently causes Shao Kahn's downfall when he reveals the Elder Gods are obligated to stop the tyrant for failing to honor Mortal Kombat's rules. Raiden kills Shao Kahn and halts his invasion, but Quan Chi makes preparations for Shinnok's invasion, leading Netherrealm's forces in attacking the weakened Earthrealm and Outworld. In Mortal Kombat X (2015), Quan Chi uses the Earthrealm revenants to aid him in retrieving Shinnok's amulet over the course of two years. Though he succeeds in doing so with the aid of D'Vorah, he is decapitated by the resurrected Hanzo Hasashi (Scorpion) once he learns the sorcerer conspired with the Lin Kuei ninja Sektor to kill the Shirai Ryu.

In Mortal Kombat 1, Quan Chi returns to live as part of the new era after Liu Kang replaced Kronika as titan of time and rewrited destiny. In Liu Kang's new timeline, Quan Chi led a meaningless life in the mines before being contacted by "Damashi", who helps him learn his sorcerer abilities. He begins working with Shang Tsung and General Shao to deceive Empress Sindel into turning against Earthrealm and preparing a coup to overthrow her. While creating Ermac, Quan Chi attempts to prepare a soul stealer to unleash on Earthrealm before he is stopped by Ashrah. One of the souls that escapes the contraptions attacks him, partially devouring his life force, resulting in his skin turning white. After discovering that Damashi is Titan Shang Tsung, who is intent on killing everyone in the timeline, Quan Chi and Shang Tsung assist Liu Kang in stopping him. During the final battle, Titan Shang Tsung summons a Titan Quan Chi to assist him, but both ultimately lose. Afterwards, Quan Chi is imprisoned in Outworld but is freed by Ermac. Left without allies, he returns to the Netherrealm and begins plotting to take the Hourglass for himself.

The character was well-liked, but his Fatalities were mixed.

Three-Fifths Compromise

In 1787, the US constitutional convention looked at the problem of counting its population. The population of a state determines the influence a state can take in a presidential election. The convention also looked at the problem of counting slaves: If they were counted, the state would have more power in the election, the taxes the state would have to pay to the government would also be higher. The Three-Fifths Compromise was that three out of every five slaves would be counted, in other words, black slaves were counted as three fifths of a human being. The compromise of counting "all other persons" as only three-fifths of their actual numbers reduced the representation of the slave states relative to the original proposals, but improved it over the Northern position. An inducement for slave states to accept the Compromise was its tie to taxation in the same ratio, so that the burden of taxation on the slave states was also reduced.

A contentious issue at the 1787 Constitutional Convention was whether slaves would be counted as part of the population in determining representation of the states in the Congress or would instead be considered property and, as such, not be considered for purposes of representation. Delegates from states with a large population of slaves argued that slaves should be considered persons in determining representation, but as property if the new government were to levy taxes on the states on the basis of population. Delegates from states where slavery had become rare argued that slaves should be included in taxation, but not in determining representation.

The proposed ratio was, however, a ready solution to the problem that arose during the Constitutional Convention. In amending the Articles, the North wanted slaves to count for more than the South did because the objective was to determine taxes paid by the states to the federal government. In the Constitutional Convention, the more important issue was representation in Congress, so the South wanted slaves to count for more than the North did.

Death of Raman Bandarenka

Raman Bandarenka (, ) (August 1, 1989, Minsk – November 12, 2020, Minsk) was an Belarusian designer, and shop manager. His death is associated with the protests against the 2020 Belarusian presidential election. Raman Bandarenka died after reportedly being beaten by security forces. Police forces said they found him uncounscious and called an ambulance.

According to sources, masked assailants in civilian clothing beat him up, in the yard of his appartment building, in the evening of November 11, 2020, in Minsk. Locally, this appartment complex is known as "" (Ploscha Peramen)." Later, a minibus took him away. An ambulance brigade brought from the Central District Department of Internal Affairs (Police Station) to a local hospital. At the time he ambulance took him, he was unconscious. At the hospital, he was diagnosed with diferent injuries to the head and brain, bruises, and abrasions. Banderenka was operated in an attempt to save his life and fell into a coma. He never recovered and died on November 12, 2020, in the hospital in Minsk.

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights spoke on the death.

Raman Bandarenka born on August 1, 1989 in Minsk. After school, he entered the Minsk State College of Architecture and Construction, and then the Belarusian State Academy of Arts, graduating from the Faculty of Design in 2012.

In 2014, he was conscripted into the Special Forces of the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus (military unit 3214), and subsequently stayed in contact with his colleagues. Later, he worked as an administrator and then director of one of the retail stores of the "Ostrov Chistoty" in Minsk.

During the protests, the yard next to the house in which Raman lived became widely known as the "Square of Changes )". This name arose after residents of the residential complex in the quarter between Chervyakova, Kakhovskaya and Smorgovsky tract streets painted a mural with "DJs of Change," two DJs who played the Russian pop song called "" at an event and were subsequently arrested, on one of the walls of a transformer booth. This mural was repeatedly destroyed, but then restored again by the local residents. The yard was often covered with red and white ribbons, symbolising the , which has become a symbol for the freedom movement in Belarus.

On November 11, 2020, at about 22:00, six men and 3 women in civilian clothes and in masks arrived at the "" and began to cut off the red and white ribbons placed by local residents. Raman Bandarenka found out about this in a local text chat in the popular app Telegram. He posted his final message in the group, "I'm going out!" before going out to the street to see what was happening.

Outside, he stood watching what was happening. According to reports, he may have made a remark to which one of the masked people replied to him harshly before pushing Raman to the ground. At this time, Raman hit his head on a children's slide as he fell. The masked assailants proceeded to pin Raman to the ground and command him to "Lie down!" The main initiator of the fight left, and three others continued to beat him.

Following the assault, Raman was dragged off to a silver minibus. This is the last known time he was seen conscious. The events of this evening were filmed by eyewitnesses from different angles and then posted on the net.

He was taken to the Central District Department of Internal Affairs (Police Station), from which he was admitted to the Emergency Department of the Minsk City Clinical Emergency Hospital on November 12 at 0:05. He was diagnosed with multiple injuries. He underwent an operation in an attempt to save his life. Raman Bandarenka died on November 12, 2020.

A number of sportspeople have previously identified them in photos and videos of the masked persons who attacked Bandarenka. Baskau and Shakuta did not comment on the suspicions. In the same month Estonia also imposed a travel ban against Shakuta and Baskau. In January 2020 the International Ice Hockey Federation declared that it opened an independent investigation concerning the involvement of Dzmitry Baskau in this incident.

On the evening of November 12, several thousand Belarusians came to the “Square of Change” to pay tribute to Raman Bandarenka. The next day, in various districts of Minsk, other cities and villages of Belarus, people came out to express their sympathy.

The family invited everyone to the ceremony, which was attended by several thousands. Many chanted popular slogans, such as "Long live Belarus!", "We will not forget, we will not forgive!”, “Roma, you are a hero”, and “I'm going out” - Raman's final words.

On November 13, during a meeting with Belarusian and international journalists, Alexander Lukashenko expressed his condolences to the parents of Raman Bandarenka. At the conference, he said that he instructed the chairman of the Investigative Committee to investigate the incident and instructed the Prosecutor General to take it under "the most serious control." Lukashenko told reporters: ""But in this case, as I was told, a fight broke out, moreover, a serious fight. And someone from the protesters called the "police." A reinforced police squad was sent. When they arrived, as usual, everyone fled. And this one was either injured or something ... inebriated. This is a fact. The conclusion was presented today by the Investigative Committee. They posted it all. He was drunk. Of course, he was taken and taken by this department. He felt ill on the way, as I was told. They called an ambulance and sent him to the hospital.""

Chairman of the Council of the Republic Natalya Kochanova stated: ""Now there is a radicalization [of the protests]. ...This is the case with this Bondarenko. He himself went out [into the yard]. The fact that he was drunk is one hundred percent fact. Now there is an investigation, and have already established that false information was put on the Internet, that he was sober (we are talking about information and documents from the doctors of the emergency room. ). But the investigation will go further. But did you see how he [Bondarenko] was honored? A memorial! And how many drunks [in the whole country] are fighting? Every day they die. And they [the protesters] are arranging memorial services. The President said it right: we need to clean up the city!""

As of November 27, 2020, no criminal case has been instituted on Bandarenka's death, while TUT.BY journalist Katsyaryna Barysevich and doctor Artsyom Sorokin, who reported medical information that the murdered man was completely sober, refuting the words of Alexander Lukashenko and Natalya Kochanova that Bandarenka was drunk, had been detained in connection with the criminal case upon them.

On the same day, ten organizations (the Viasna Human Rights Centre, the Belarusian Association of Journalists, the Belarusian Helsinki Committee and others) made a joint statement. It said that Katsyaryna Barysevich is a political prisoner. Boris Haretski, deputy chairman of the Belarusian Association of Journalists, said that the authorities were not fighting the problem, but the media, “They think that if the press does not write about Bandarenka, people will not find out about it. Of course, they will know everything, but the media is still under attack." On March 2, 2021, Barysevich was sentenced to serve a half-year in prison and to pay a fine for damages in 100 basic units for writing on the late Raman Bandarenka, doctor Artsyom Sorokin got two years in prison and a fine in 50 basic units.

Moe thinks that his bar feels boring. He goes to a university that he used to take classes from and finds one of his old professors. The professor tells Moe to make his bar look more modern. A designer named Formico turns Moe's bar into a post-modern nightclub. Moe now gets more customers than his old bar would.

Homer, Lenny, Carl, and Barney do not like the new changes to Moe's bar. Homer turns his garage into a bar for his friends. Moe sees Homer's bar and tells him that it is illegal to own a bar in a private place. Homer says that his bar is for a hunting club. He gets a law book which says that a hunting club is allowed to serve beverages. Moe does not think that Homer is actually in a hunting club. Homer then says that he will shoot a turkey for Thanksgiving dinner.

 Jen Kamerman directed the episode. Dana Gould was the screenwriter of the episode. The episode was shown on television on the Fox network on November 18, 2001.

Meyer also wanted the university Moe went to in the episode to be similar to the school in the television show "The Paper Chase". Moe's old professor would also be similar to the professor from the show.

In one part of the episode, Homer creates a hunting club so that he can sell alcohol without a liquor license. This was based on the time Gould's father started a hunting club to sell alcohol without a license. Homer's bar was going to be the main story of the episode. This was changed when writers got the idea of making the design of Moe's bar post-modern.

The rock band R.E.M. appears as guest stars in the episode. Mike Scully said that R.E.M. were "big fans of the show" and that their appearance was a "fairly last-minute addition".

Formico was voiced by Hank Azaria.

Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict said that "Homer the Moe" is a "tepid remix of previous "Simpsons" plots". R.L. Shaffer of IGN said that the episode is one of the worst episodes of the show. Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide thought that the episode's story was too similar to the season 3 episode "Flaming Moe's". However, he says that the episode "works resonably well" and is "one of the year's best episodes." Simon Crerar of "The Times" thought that R.E.M.'s performance in the episode was one of the funniest cameo appearances in the show.


Life-affirming

If something is life-affirming it means it has a positive and healthy attitude towards living. It is the opposite of being "life-denying". To affirm means to agree or to say something is good.

This is also called "Nietzschean affirmation" after the German thinker Friedrich Nietzsche. Nietzsche wrote that a person is life-affirming only if they life the way it is. This means to love their life even when it hurts or isn't comfortable. Nietzsche wrote that the best people will say yes to living, even if they would have to live the exact same life on Earth over and over. He wrote that if anyone truly affirms even just one moment then they affirm everything in life. If someone "has trembled with happiness and sounded like a harp string just once, all eternity was needed to produce this one event—and in this single moment of affirmation all eternity was called good, redeemed, justified, and affirmed." According to Nietzsche, Christians are not life-affirming.

Primordial black hole

In cosmology, primordial black holes (PBHs) are black holes that we think might exist in the Universe today. These black holes might have been created just after the Big Bang.

Immediately after the Big Bang, when the Universe was still getting bigger, the universe was an extreme place full of subatomic particles and lots of energy. Inside this extreme place, there were places where matter was very denser than the matter around it. In these places, gravity caused these places to collapse. This gravitational collapse would have created primordial black holes. These black holes are not created when very massive stars die like with stellar black holes but we're created in the early universe.

The idea of primordial black holes was first introduced by Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich and Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov in 1966. But, it was the Stephen Hawking who studied these interesting objects even more in 1971. Whether or not primordial black holes are real is still being talked about by scientists.

In September 2022, researchers gave an idea that primordial black holes might be the reason for the very massive early galaxies found by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Another interesting idea is that primordial black holes could be dark matter though we don't know if this is true.

Handover of Hong Kong

The handover of Hong Kong, or the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong (also called "the Handover" or "the Return" in mainland China) was when the country that controlled Hong Kong was changed from the United Kingdom to China. The handover happened on 1 July 1997. Before this day, British Hong Kong was controlled by the United Kingdom as a colony and a British Dependent Territory. After the handover, Hong Kong became a special administrative region (SAR) of China.

The handover was the end of British control of Hong Kong. They governed over it for 156 years. Because the number of people living in Hong Kong was 6.5 million in 1997, it was the majority of people (97%) living in all British Dependent Territories. Some people think that the handover was the end of the British Empire.

The United Kingdom controlled many parts of India by the 1830s. Their goal in this land was to grow cotton so that they didn't have to buy so much from the United States. They were not able to grow cotton, but they found out that they could grow poppies in India and turn them into opium. The British smuggled opium into China so that they could buy tea. This was one of the reasons the Opium Wars happened, when Britain and China fought with each other. After the Opium Wars, the two countries signed three different treaties with the Qing Empire, who controlled China at the time.

Britain was given the power to control the land of Hong Kong in these treaties:

Even though the British did not control the New Territories forever, this part of Hong Kong was developed as quickly as the other parts of Hong Kong. Because there was not enough land and natural resources in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, a lot of infrastructure was also built in the New Territories. When Britain and China began talking about what would happen to Hong Kong after 1997, many people thought it was very hard to separate the New Territories and the rest of Hong Kong and only give the New Territories back to China.

Snow in Florida

The U.S. state Florida does not get snow very often. Most of the time, major cities in Florida do not get snowfall that can be measured. Some areas in the far north are able to get snow more often. The National Weather Service says that the Florida Keys and Key West have not gotten a snow flurry in more than 300 years. In Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Palm Beach, only one snow flurry was recorded. This happened in January 1977. Miami, Fort Lauderdale, or Palm Beach have not had a snow flurry before or after that.

Florida's climate is low latitude and subtropical. Temperatures that are cold enough to have snowfall do not happen long. Frost is more likely to happen than snow because it needs a temperature of 32°F or 0°C, less than 2 m or 7 ft above sea level, no clouds in the sky, and a relative humidity of 65% or more. For snow to happen in Florida, a polar jet stream must go south through Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. A cold front has to stop around the south part of Florida and curve northeast to add very cold air into clouds.

The earliest known time Florida got snow was in 1774. People in Florida thought it was "extraordinary white rain." The first White Christmas in the northeast part of Florida was on December 23, 1989.

Book of the Consulate of the Sea

The Book of the Consulate of the Sea or Book of the Consulate of Sea is a 15th-century maritime commercial law treaty. Is a compendium of maritime law that governed trade in the Mediterranean for centuries. Of Catalan origin, it was translated into many languages and served as the basis for current international maritime law.i

The text serves as disclosure of the practice in the sea, commenting on the uses and customs as a manual. Considered an excellent primary source on the customs of the time, it collects a lot of information on the legal systems of the time in Europe. The"editio princeps" is in the Catalan language, and was printed in Barcelona in 1484, reprinted again ten years later. The first Italian translation is of 1519, it is the work of Antonio Blado and the second at Venice by Giovanni Battista Pederzano (1549), and then by Francesco Lorenzini (1564). If there are more than twenty editions in Italian and others in English, French, German, Dutch, and Spanish.

According to Chiner and Chacon, the Ordinances of the Ribera (i.e. seaside) (" Ordianationis Ripairiœ "), written in 1258, did not yet encode the maritime customs of Barcelona, and that the first reference to "Sea consuls" appears in Barcelona in 1282, just one year before the Consulate of the Sea was created in Valencia. Also note that the consuls of Barcelona had no independence assigned later on in the "Book of the Consulate of the Sea". Customs collected in the book would be in part coming from a Barcelona origin, but many would have been created and consolidated in Valencia, from which have been copied to the subsequently created consulates. According to Arcadi Garcia Sanz, the main difference between the consulates of Barcelona and Valencia would be the fact that the latter had from the start a "royal jurisdiction", and therefore has influenced so strongly in the other consulates in the fifteenth century.

Hurricane Iota

Hurricane Iota was a devastating late-season Category 4 Atlantic hurricane which caused severe damage to areas of Central America already devastated by Hurricane Eta just less than two weeks prior. The 31st and final tropical cyclone, 30th named storm, 14th hurricane, and record-tying seventh major hurricane of the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Iota originated as a tropical wave that moved into the Eastern Caribbean on November 10. Over the next few days, the wave began to become better organized and by November 13, it developed into a tropical depression north of Colombia. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Iota six hours later. The storm was initially impacted by some wind shear, but a center relocation and relaxed shear allowed Iota to quickly strengthen into a hurricane on November 15, after which it underwent explosive intensification, peaking at Category 5 with wind speeds of 160 mph (257 km/h), operationally. However, the peak was adjusted down to a 155 mph (249 km/h) high-end Category 4 in post-season analysis. After weakening slightly, Iota made landfall in northeastern Nicaragua as a high-end Category 4 hurricane, becoming the strongest recorded hurricane to make landfall in Nicaragua in November. Iota then rapidly weakened as it moved inland, dissipating on November 18, the storm killed 61 people and 41 were reported missing during the storm

Peace of Riga

The Peace of Riga, or The Treaty of Riga (Polish:"Traktat ryski)", was signed in Riga on March 18 1921 by the Second Polish Republic, Soviet Russia, and Soviet Ukraine and ended the Polish-Soviet War.

The borders between Poland and Russia that were changed by the treaty stayed the same until World War II, when the Soviets took eastern Poland. That was finalized by the Yalta Conference and the Potsdam Conference.

World War I changed the imperial borders of Europe. In 1918, after the Russian Revolution, Russia gave up Poland at the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. After the war ended by Germany losing. Poland was recreated after over 100 years of being divided by three countries.

The Russian Civil War gave Poland the chance to regain the land that had been controlled by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth but was taken by Russia in the 18th century. Meanwhile, the Soviet leaders wanted to attack Poland to respond to the leader of Poland, Józef Piłsudski, who had moved into Ukraine. The Soviets saw Poland as a land bridge to Western Europe, which they could cross to expand communism to the West. That started the Polish-Soviet War. A grear victory for Poland happened at the Battle of Warsaw. Both sides were now tired and wanted to end the war. Other victories by Poland placed it under pressure by the League of Nations, which also wanted to end the war after it had taken a lot of land.

Peace talks started in Minsk on August 17, 1920, but since the Poles' counterattack had moved closer, the negotiations moved to Riga and continued on September 21. The Soviets suggested two solutions, one on 21 September and a second on 28 September. The Poles suggested another solution on October 2. Three days later, the Soviets suggested a change to the offer to the Poles, who accepted it. An end to the war was signed on 12 October, and the war actually ended on 18 October 1920. The leading negotiators were, Jan Dąbski from Poland and Adolph Joffe from Soviet Russia. The Soviets did not let the anti-communist Ukrainian leaders be in the negotiations. 

The Soviets' military problems made them give up much of the land that they wanted. However, to many other people, it looked as if Poland had lost the war.

Most of the Polish negotiators were members of the National Democrats, who were Piłsudski's political enemies. They did not want more than a third of the people living in Poland to be ethnic non-Polish and so they agreed to get less land than they could have gotten although many Poles would be left on the Soviet side of the border. The Soviets had been willing to give up even Minsk.

Mudd Club

The Mudd Club was a nightclub in the TriBeCa area of New York City, USA. It was open from 1978 to 1983. It was a place for underground music and counterculture events. It was located at 77 White Street in downtown Manhattan and was opened by Steve Maas, art curator Diego Cortez and downtown punk scene figure Anya Phillips.

The Mudd Club was named after Samuel Alexander Mudd, a doctor who treated John Wilkes Booth after Abraham Lincoln's assassination. It closed in 1983.

To space for the Mudd Club was a loft owned by artist Ross Bleckner. Steve Mass described the future venue as cabaret to get the space from Bleckner. Mass said they started the nightclub on a budget of only $15,000.

The club featured a bar, gender-neutral bathrooms and a gallery. Keith Haring ran the gallery and selected artwork to show on the fourth floor. Live performances included new wave, experimental music, literary icons Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs, and catwalk exhibitions for new fashion designers Anna Sui and Jasper Conran.

From the start it was an "amazing antidote to the uptown glitz of Studio 54 in the '70s". As it became more frequented by downtown celebrities, a door policy was established and it acquired a chic, often elitist reputation.

Many of Manhattan's up-and-coming cult celebrities went to the Mudd Club. Other people associated with the venue included musicians Lou Reed, Johnny Thunders, David Byrne, Debbie Harry, Arto Lindsay, John Lurie, Nico with Jim Tisdall, Lydia Lunch, X, the Cramps, the B-52's, the Bongos and Judas Priest, artist Jean-Michel Basquiat and his then-girlfriend Madonna; performers Klaus Nomi and John Sex; designers Betsey Johnson, Maripol and Marisol; and underground filmmakers Amos Poe; Vincent Gallo, Kathy Acker, and Glenn O'Brien.

Live music at the club featured New York no wave bands like DNA, Nona Hendryx's Zero Cool, the Contortions, and Basquiat's band Gray. In 1979, Talking Heads performed songs from their new album "Fear of Music". Tim Page produced several concerts at the Mudd Club in 1981, in an attempt to meld contemporary classical music with rock and pop. On the dance floor, DJs David Azarch, Anita Sarko and Johnny Dynell played a mix of punk, funk and curiosities.

Six months after it opened, the Mudd Club was cited in "People Magazine": "New York’s fly-by-night crowd of punks, posers and the ultra-hip has discovered new turf on which to flaunt its manic chic. It is the Mudd Club... For sheer kinkiness, there has been nothing like it since the cabaret scene in 1920s Berlin".

After its first few years, Studio 54 celebrities like Andy Warhol, Grace Jones and David Bowie began to go there. In 1981, the Mudd Club's Steve Mass began going to the more informal Club 57 on St. Mark's Place. He began hiring people from the Club 57 crowd (including Haring).

Mudd Club entry tickets, white with black print, are extremely rare. 
The Mudd Club closed in 1983. It had just become a regular club and was not so special anymore.

The band Talking Heads mentioned the club in their 1979 song "Life During Wartime". The Ramones included it in their 1980 song "The Return of Jackie and Judy". Nina Hagen mentioned it in her 1983 song "New York / N.Y.". Elliott Murphy sang about it in his 1983 song "Off the Shelf". Frank Zappa named a song for the club on his album "You Are What You Is".

Mass opened another Mudd Club in Berlin in 2001. It was at located at Grosse Hamburger Strasse 17. This Berlin club was small club for touring bands.

In 2007, the arts organization Creative Time placed a plaque on the NYC building to mark the club.

Single wicket cricket

Single wicket cricket is a form of cricket which is mainly played between two opponents, the batter and bowler. 

The main feature of single wicket cricket is that the batter had to run from his ground at the striker's end to the bowling crease at the bowler's end and back to score a run. This is different from regular cricket, in which a batter only needs to run between the two batsmens' grounds, and means that one run can only be scored when the batter runs 124 feet (37.7 meters), rather than 58 feet (17.6 meters).


Last man stands cricket

Last man stands cricket (LMS) is a form of cricket in which a single batter can bat alone if all other players on his team are out. It has innings with 20 overs of 5 balls each, like in 100-ball cricket.

When a single batter bats alone (is the "last man standing"), they can only be safe when in the ground at the striker's end, which is the area they start running from.

Death by coconut

A falling coconut that hits a person can cause injury to their back, neck, shoulders, and head. It could even kill a person.

A 1984 study on "Injuries Due to Falling Coconuts" made people exaggerate statements about how many people died by falling coconuts. An urban legend says that falling coconuts kill a few people every year. This became more known in 2002 when an expert in shark attacks says that falling coconuts kill 150 people every year around the world. This statement is often compared to the number of deaths that are caused by a shark (which is around 5 deaths every year). Reports of death by coconuts have happened in the 1770s.
