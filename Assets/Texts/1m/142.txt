The band had its first hit song in the UK with "Yesterday's Gone". That song became a hit in the United States in the following year as part of the British Invasion. 

The duo had many hits in the United States, including "Willow Weep for Me", "Before and After", and their biggest hit, "A Summer Song".

Blind-baking

Baking blind is the process of baking a pie crust or other pastry without the filling. Blind baking a pie crust is important when it will be filled with an unbaked filling (such as with pudding or cream pies). Blind baking can also be used if the filling has a shorter baking time than the crust. Blind baking is also used to keep pie crust from becoming soggy because of a wet filling.

Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)

The Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation or SVR RF () is Russia's external intelligence agency.

It is mainly concerned with civilian affairs. The SVR RF succeeded the First Chief Directorate (PGU) of the KGB in December 1991. The SVR has its headquarters in Moscow.

Unlike the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the SVR does intelligence and espionage activities outside the Russian Federation. It works with the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate {the GRU), its military-affairs espionage counterpart. The SVR is also negotiates anti-terrorist cooperation and intelligence-sharing arrangements with foreign intelligence agencies. It gives analysis and dissemination of intelligence to the Russian president.

SVR RF is the official foreign-operations successor to many Soviet-era foreign intelligence agencies, from the original 'foreign department' of the Cheka under Vladimir Lenin, to the OGPU and NKVD of the Stalinist era, followed by the First Chief Directorate of the KGB.

Blanching (cooking)

Blanching is a cooking process in which a food, usually a vegetable or fruit, is scalded in boiling water, removed after a short timed break, and then dropped into cold water to stop the cooking process. Blanching foods helps reduce the loss of quality over time.

People usually use blanching to treat food before freezing, drying, or canning—heating vegetables or fruits to inactivate enzymes, change texture and remove the peel. Blanching is also used to preserve color, flavor, and nutritional value. The benefits of blanching include removing pesticide residues and killing of microorganisms. The disadvantages of blanching can include leaching of nutrients that dissolves in water and the production of effluent.

Blanching is a process mainly used to inactivate enzymes that cause browning as well as changes in texture and off-flavors. Blanching is used to peel fruits, vegetable, and nut as steam peeling produces less environmental pollution.

Blanching is also used to kill microorganisms, remove pesticide and toxic residues, surface cleaning, removing damaged seeds or foreign materials and killing parasites and their eggs.

Traditionally, blanching is done using either a water bath or saturated steam. In both methods, the food is heated for a short period of time and then dropped into either cold water or cold air to quickly stop the heating process. At the industrial level, foods move on a conveyor belt through preheating, holding, and cooling systems.

Steam blanching systems inject hot air onto food as it passes through the blanching system on a conveyor belt. This method reduces the leaching of water-soluble compounds from the product. It is more energy-efficient. This reduced heat exposure preserves color, flavor, and overall quality of the food.
Emerging technologies include ohmic, infrared, microwave, and radio frequency blanching.

Tthe times and temperatures are not enough to effectively destroy all microorganisms.

A limitation to hot water blanching is the leaching of water-soluble nutrients and the degradation of thermal sensitive compounds. Vitamins, minerals, and other water-soluble compounds, such as proteins, sugars, and flavor compounds, diffuse out of the food and into the water, lowering the overall quality of the food. The degree to which compounds diffuse out of food depends on the food's composition and characteristics, the water to food ratio, the blanching temperature, and other variables. Ascorbic acid, thiamin, and many aromatic compounds are heat-sensitive.

A complication in the food industry is the production of effluent from water blanching systems. Blanching with reused water can lead to a buildup of water-soluble compounds that are considered pollutants, and therefore must be properly treated before being discharged. This can increase capital costs at the industrial level and has been a main reason for the development of newer blanching technologies.

Sian Elias

Dame Sian Seerpoohi Elias (born 13 March 1949) is a New Zealand jurist. She served as the 12th Chief Justice of New Zealand from 1999 to 2019. She was the first woman to hold the position. She has also been the Administrator of the Government four times (2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016).

Elias was born in London. Her mother was Welsh and her father was of Armenian ancestry. In 1952, her family moved to New Zealand. They settled in Titirangi, Auckland. She married businessman Hugh Fletcher in 1970.

Perseus (spy)

Perseus was the code name of a hypothetical Soviet atomic spy that, if real, would have allegedly breached United States national security by infiltrating Los Alamos National Laboratory during the development of the Manhattan Project, and consequently, would have been instrumental for the Soviets in the development of nuclear weapons.

Among researchers of the subject there is some consensus that Perseus never existed and was actually a creation of Soviet intelligence.
A reference to the profile of a spy who can be identified with Perseus describes him as an American scientist of young age at the time of the Manhattan Project.

If they were real, Perseus would have supposedly participated in the Spanish Civil War.

In the early 1940s Perseus would have been in New York City visiting his sick parents. During his stay in that city, he would have managed to be recruited by the GRU after looking for and contacting Morris Cohen, an American who joined the Communist Party during the Great Depression and worked as a Soviet spy.

The meeting with Cohen must have been between September 1941 and July 1942, before Cohen enlisted in the army and left for the Western Front in Europe.

Perseus reportedly introduced himself to Cohen as a physicist who had been invited to join the work at Los Alamos research center. By 1942, Perseus was supposedly already working at Los Alamos, being that he would have started sometime at least 18 months before German physicist and also atomic spy Klaus Fuchs, who joined the investigation in mid-1944. However, Perseus appears to have been recruited by the Soviets around the same (or at least a nearby) time as Fuchs.

According to articles published in Russia by "The New Times", Perseus would have collaborated with the Soviet government for purely ideological reasons to the point that he refused any financial rewards in exchange for classified information, since he was convinced that the United States would use the atomic bomb against the Soviet Union, claiming that:

With Morris Cohen in Europe, his wife, Lona Cohen, took it upon herself to travel to Albuquerque on one or two occasions (depending on the source consulted) to serve as a carrier.

Once there, Lona Cohen would have received information allegedly directly from Perseus, and took it to the Soviet consul in New York, Anatoli Yatskov. This information allegedly included crucial details about the Trinity Test, which was detonated in July 1945.

In the 1950s, Perseus was supposedly under the control of Rudolf Abel.

According to one source, Perseus was supposedly still alive in 1991.

Perseus was also allegedly referred by or identified with the code names of «Mr. X», «Youngster», FOGEL, PERS and «Mlad».

This name is also given to a spy at White Sands Missile Range, located further south near Las Cruces, New Mexico.

In April 1991, KGB colonel and public relations officer Vladimir Chikov published articles in the Russian weekly "The New Times" in which he commented on the existence of a Russian spy who worked in the Manhattan project under the code name of Perseus, giving details of his recruitment and achievements.

Regarding the information published by Chikov in "The New Times", an article in The Washington Post comments:

In an interview published in 1992, the former Soviet consul in New York, Anatoli Yatskov, confirmed the existence of Perseus, as an important figure among scientists working on the Manhattan project.

During his tenure as consul, Yatskov used the pseudonym Anatoly Yakovlev and served as a Soviet intelligence agent, coordinating atomic spies in the United States.

Yatskov gave details about Perseus' recruitment, how he sent information from New Mexico to New York (through Morris Cohen's wife), and confirmed that the Soviet Union received information from both, Klaus Fuchs and Perseus.

In an interview given before his death in 1995, the American-born Soviet spy Morris Cohen confirmed that in addition to Karl Fuchs, there was a second physicist in the Manhattan project who worked as a Soviet spy.

The details in Cohen's story coincide with the statements of Colonel Vladimir Chikov a few years ago, such as the recruitment of people close to the Manhattan Project as spies, the existence (suspected by the American intelligence) of an unidentified scientist who collaborated with Soviet intelligence, and the interaction of said scientist with Lona Cohen (Morris Cohen's wife) to transport stolen information.

According to Cohen, by the fall of 1994 there were very few people left in Soviet intelligence ("two or maybe three") who knew the real name of the second spy scientist.

For her part, shortly before her death in 1992, Lona Cohen had a telephone interview with historian Walter Schneir. In that interview, Lona Cohen confirmed that she had made at least one trip between Albuquerque and New York to transport classified information stolen to the United States, but she could not quite remember who she had interviewed with in New Mexico, saying that it was probably a scientist or physicist.

The Venona project was a United States counterintelligence program run by the Signal Intelligence Service that (later became part of the National Security Agency,) started in the Second World War and was active since February 1943 to October 1980.

The objective of the program was to intercept and decrypt messages from diplomats, intelligence agencies (such as the NKVD and the KGB), business representatives and other actors of the Soviet government.

Despite the fact that only a fraction of the messages intercepted by Venona were suitable for decryption, the project left an archive of around 3000 decrypted and translated messages.

Although there is no mention of Perseus in the Venona files, there are references to a spy under the code name PERS or FOGEL. Apparently, at some point the codename PERS was turned into Perseus by mistake.

PERS was identified in the Venona files as part of the group of four Soviet spies (of which only 3 had been identified) who infiltrated the Manhattan Project. 

Despite the fact that by 2012 a publication by NSA's Center for Cryptologic History described PERS as ""important, but still unidentified"", the references in the Venona files have been questioned or even used to confirm that Perseus never existed.

From the early 1950s till 1995, three Soviet spies had been confirmed to have infiltrated Los Alamos: Klaus Fuchs (German physicist), David Greenglass (military man and brother-in-law of Julius Rosenberg) and Theodore Hall (American physicist).

Fuchs voluntarily confessed to British MI5 authorities in January 1950 and this subsequently lead to Greenglass in June of that same year. Finally, Hall's involvement was not identified until the release of documents from Venona in 1995, a few years before his death in 1999.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, publications like those by Chikov and Yatskov strengthened the theory of a possible fourth spy in Los Alamos, who would have been identified as Perseus (the PERS in the Venona files) or FOGEL.

In 1994 the lieutenant general and Soviet agent Pavel Sudoplatov published a book titled "Special Tasks".

In the book, Sudoplatov referred to the statements made by Anatoly Yatskov, and stated that he did not remember that code name and, that in his opinion, it could be that Yatskov or his associates created Perseus to cover the true identities of Soviet informants.

However, Sudoplatov also acknowledged that the codename Perseus was used to refer to or cover a number agents and anonymous sources.

United States Cold War historian John Earl Haynes concluded that Perseus was an invention relying on the research of authors Joseph Albright, Marcia Kunstel and Gary Kern.

In an index of false names, pseudonyms, and real names of spies, Haynes notes under the Perseus entry that:

However, Haynes acknowledges that although Perseus was an invention, there must have been a 4th Soviet spy operating in Los Alamos during the development of the Manhattan project in addition to the 3 spies identified until 1995: Klaus Fuchs, David Greenglass and Theodore Hall.

In their book "Bombshell: The Secret Story of America's Unknown Atomic Spy Conspiracy", the authors Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel dedicate the twentieth chapter to Perseus under the title of "The Perseus Myth" in which they conclude that the spy never existed.

According to the authors, the KGB may have created Perseus for the purposes of self-promotion, justify its own existence, and even to secure more state funding.

In 2006 mail that was made public, author Gary Kern explained why he believed Perseus was an invention. Kern believes that Perseus was an extremely risky disinformation operation with multiple objectives, including:


In April 1999 American scientist, activist and, president of the Federation of American Scientists from 1970 to 2000; Jeremy Stone, published his memoirs under the title «"Every Man Should Try": Adventures of a Public Interest Activist"».

Motivated by an article in The Washington Post about Vladimir Chikov's publications in Russia, Stone decided to take on the subject, and in his book he disclosed conversations and visits he had with someone he knew personally and only identified with the pseudonym "Scientist X" (or «Dr. X» ), and explained why he believed that this "Scientist X" was the real Perseus.

Despite the use of a pseudonym, thanks to the information in the book, the "Scientist X" was easily identified as Philip Morrison, a physicist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Morrison denied the accusation and gave a solid rebuttal against it, noting that:


On the other hand, the reasons that led Stone to suspect Morrison were questioned. Namely, those reasons included:


To all of the above, Stone accepted Morrison's rebuttal, stating that: "In the light of these facts, which I certainly cannot contradict, [...] I can only accept your denial that you are Perseus."

Finally, thanks to the controversy raised by the event, several academics and people close to the Federation of American Scientists expressed their wishes for Stone to apologize, and even the idea of calling Stone to present his resignation as head of the Federation.

According to historian John Earl Haynes and academic Harvey Klehr, thanks to FBI documents that were declassified in the 2010s, they were able to confirm the existence of a suspected fourth spy who they identified as Oscar Seborer.

Seborer was an American engineer who was drafted into the United States Army in 1942 and, like all his siblings, had sympathy for the Communist Party USA.

Given his education as an engineer, Seborer was assigned to the «Special Engineer Detachment», a program that identified members of the military with specific abilities and funneled them to the Manhattan project.

However, Haynes and Klehr are emphatic that Seborer should not be identified with Perseus, since while Perseus would have been an invention probably based on Theodore Hall, Seborer's life and profile have no relation to the characteristics attributed to Perseus.
According to historian John Eark Haynes and academic Harvey Klehr, although Perseus never really existed, some aspects of his character were based on or coincide with the American Soviet spy and physicist Theodore Hall. These aspects include:


Born in New York City, Hall was an American physicist who was considered a prodigy from an early age and graduate from Harvard University at 18. Concerned about the advance of fascism at the time, Hall developed sympathies for socialism.

Although Haynes and Klehr noted that the agent identified as Perseus (or sometimes as "Mlad") has attributes and characteristics that do not match Hall, they still concluded that Perseus must have actually been an invention, the result of a misinformation operation with the goal of protecting Hall, who was still alive in the early 1990s. Which could explain the presence of attributes that coincide between both at the same time of others that do not.

On August 19, 2020, Perseus was first referenced in the worldwide teaser trailer for "". He was later confirmed as the main antagonist in the game's which is set in the 1980s and flashbacks of the Vietnam War.



Haltlose personality disorder

Haltlose personality disorder is a mental illness that displays as selfishness, blaming others for the actions they have committed, lacking direction in life and a lack of insight and self-control. They are unable to learn from experience or mistakes in life since they lack any sense of past or future, and are not able to genuinely care about other people. People with Haltlose are also called an unstable psychopath.

It is studied in psychiatry, sociology and criminology - and is one of the most common types of psychopathy to end up committing crimes, including violence and murder. Healthier individuals may still focus on either vengeance or sadism. Parents with Haltlose make up the majority of those who sexually molest their own children.

The disorder has many things in common with anti-social personality disorder and borderline personality disorder (BPD). In some countries, doctors diagnose BPD to describe two sets of behaviors, but doctors in other countries diagnose the one group as BPD and the other group as Haltlose, or some people might have both. Usually people with Haltlose will also have other mental illnesses, such as histrionic personality disorder narcissistic personality disorder or fantasy prone personality.

When diagnosing, doctors may sometimes mistake this disorder with bipolar disorder. It can also look like epilepsy if combined with alcoholism.

It can be very difficult for a doctor to help them become better since they tend to lie to doctors because they are afraid, and their pathological lying can be convincing even though they view it similar to a child and often believe they should be rewarded for having taken the time to invent such a good lie.

Of all the different types of psychiatric patients, those with Haltlose personality disorder have some of the worst results.

The Haltlose will usually need boundaries and controls set by those around them, and "optimistic" professionals suggest that marriage to a spouse willing to curtail their behaviors may be sufficient to avoid professional involvement. Their symptoms get worse if they are given independence, whether at home, work or in a prison or hospital.

The name is based on a German word, "Haltlos", which means "without stability". In this context it is used for an irresponsible and unstable lifestyle. It appears in the ICD-10 book, but not in the DSM-V book.

Like other personality disorders, nobody is certain what causes it. There appears to be both genetic and environmental causes, and although it is difficult to identify in children - by adolescence it is typically easy to diagnose. It is believed to be caused by the mother, not the father, both from her own health and also from how she treated the child when they were young.

It is equally common in males and females, and doctors must be careful not to wrongly identify a child as Haltlose since many of the symptoms are actually normal for children,such as selfishness, lack of planning and feigning emotions they see others having, and they only suggest a mental illness if they continue at later ages.

Professionals disagree on whether the Haltlose are actually unable to understand the difference between good and evil, or if they understand but do not care, or if they deliberately choose evil instead of good.

Usually people with Haltlose personality disorder stop showing their symptoms almost immediately if they are in a controlled environment, like the army or a psychiatric hospital or prison.

People with Haltlose personality disorder have "primitive reactions" to things, and their largest focus is simply on their own survival. They frequently struggle with addictions, such as with drugs or alcohol, and are one of two types of personality disorders that commit the most crimes. They also tend to have abnormal sexual habits, such as BDSM or increased masturbation.

They do struggle with addictions, most commonly with alcoholism. They often consume drugs, coffee, tea or medicines in larger quantities than normal. Because they spend so much money, they usually have large debts they cannot pay - and either ask family to pay, ignore, or attempt crime (theft, prostitution, etc) to pay their debts. However many professionals suggest that parents and spouses do not pay such debts, and instead let the Haltlose person's bad decisions lead them to institutionalization where they will be healthier and have more guidance.

Although they often threaten or pretend to commit suicide, suicide pacts or murder suicide, they do not commonly actually do it since they are easily distracted and made happy again. Often their reason for pretending is because they are scared of an approaching consequence for their actions, of even because they like the "excitement" of police and hospitals becoming involved. Lobotomy was tested as a possible means to limit their chaotic thinking.

It can be very difficult for people to understand them, because they can have "a number of endearing qualities" such as appearing naturally charming, plausible, likable or emotionally warm, but they are actually using those as tools to "conquer" the people watching them.

Usually, they do not like science or religion as they control and limit the answers. Often, they are very good at arts like acting in theatres: their lack of memory means that they can easily play new characters and feel very similar to the character they are playing.

Some have said that Haltlose patient should be sterilized to prevent them from having children since they are not able to make decisions that would be good for anyone except themselves and they can become "family tyrants" while pretending to be victims. Sometimes, governments have even refused them marriage licenses, out of fear that marriage would lead to them having children.

Even when they are not "true" pedophiles, the Haltlose demonstrate an increased risk of sexually molesting children, with as many as 90% of incestuous adult-child molestors being Haltlose. Mothers with Haltlose may push their young daughters to engage in sex with men that the mother wishes she could have herself. They also like to have sex with their own partners in front of the children, rather than hiding the details of their sex life.

Because they can have an "explosive" temper, domestic violence is common, beatings, death threats, smashing household objects.

Willy Roloff was a smart Pomeranian serial killer with Haltlose personality disorder, who was executed by guillotine in 1937 after his appeal for mercy to Adolf Hitler was denied.

The philosopher Max Scheler had an adult son who was diagnosed as both a Haltlose and Gemutlose psychopath. He was guilty of many crimes over twenty years, and was eventually sent to a concentration camp where it is assumed that he died.

At some times, they will look very positive and responsible and talk about large plans that they intend to accomplish, but they are actually very depressed and cynical most of the time because they are unable to make their plans work since they cannot learn from their mistakes, and they do not have a good sense of time. They will very quickly change from acting very confident and brave, to very sad, angry or afraid when their plans do not work.

A major source of the problem is that they are not able to remember the past, or think about the future - so every decision is decided only on the basis of the present time. Similarly, if asked to describe themselves, they cannot accurately describe things they felt in the past, because they only know the story they are telling right now.

Because they are not capable of planning for the future, and make very bad choices, doctors often decide they need leaders and controls to guide them in every aspect of life. This means they can be very successful when they are in a hospital, prison or school with very strict rules and leadership - because their intelligence is normal, it is just their personality disorder that leads them to trouble.

Some professionals say the haltlose do not understand warnings, so only punishments work to stop them from doing bad things. But other professionals say that they do not learn any long-term lessons from punishment.

When they feel guilty about something, they become overwhelmed with the fear that there will be consequences or punishment, so they often exaggerate or invent untruthful stories to blame other people, and will pretend that they are a victim or being exploited or held prisoner.

They will often pretend to be embarrassed, experience regret or to be submissive, even though these things are not usually real for haltlose personalities. This makes it "troublesome" for doctors trying to help them.

When they feel guilty about doing something that has not been noticed yet, they become overwhelmed with the fear that there will be consequences or punishment, so they often begin to exaggerate or invent untruthful stories to blame other people, and will pretend that they are a victim or being exploited or held prisoner. Once caught, the less intelligent haltlose will respond by claiming that their childhood was not good and that current friends or relatives have misled them and caused them to do these bad things. The more intelligent haltlose will instead invent elaborate stories with a lot of false details to misdirect attention from what they have done.

Dark Ages Radio Explorer

The Dark Ages Radio Explorer (DARE) mission is a lunar orbiter concept which will be used to identify the coming redshift from first hydrogen atoms just as the first stars began to produce light. DARE will use the redshifted 21-cm transition line from neutral hydrogen (1420.00 MHz emissions) to view and spot the formation of the first glowing objects of the universe.

Also, this is the period ending of the Dark Ages of the universe. The orbiter will explore the universe as it was from around 80 million years to 420 million years after the Big Bang. The mission will deliver data of the formation of the first stars, the beginning of black hole accretions, and the reionization of the universe. Computer models of galaxy formation will also be tested.

This mission might also add research on dark matter decay. The DARE program will also provide information for developing and deploying lunar surface telescopes that add to exoplanet exploration of nearby stars. It is expected to launch in either 2021 or 2022.

The period after recombination occurred but before stars and galaxies was created is called the "dark ages". During this time, most of the matter in the universe is neutral hydrogen. This hydrogen has yet to be observed, but there are experiments underway to detect the hydrogen line produced during this era. The hydrogen line is produced when an electron in a neutral hydrogen atom is excited to a state where the electron and proton have aligned spins, or de-excited as the electron and proton spins go from being aligned to anti-aligned. The energy difference between these two hyperfine states is formula_1 electron volts, with a wavelength of 21 centimeters. When neutral hydrogen is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the photons in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the neutral hydrogen and CMB are called to be "coupled", and the hydrogen line is not observable. It is only when the two temperatures are not same, or decoupled, that the hydrogen line can be observed.

The Big Bang produced a hot, dense, nearly homogeneous universe. As the universe expanded and cooled, particles, then nuclei, and finally atoms formed. At a redshift of about 1100, equal to about 400,000 years after the Big Bang, when the primordial plasma filling the universe cooled enough for protons and electrons to combine into neutral hydrogen atoms, the universe became optically thin by which photons from this early era no longer interacted with matter. We detect these photons today as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The CMB shows that the universe was still smooth and uniform.
After the protons and electrons combined to produce the first hydrogen atoms, the universe contained a nearly uniform, almost completely neutral, intergalactic medium (IGM) for which the most amount of matter component was hydrogen gas. With no glowing sources present, these are known as the Dark Ages. Theoretical models predict that, over the next few hundred million years, gravity slowly condensed the gas into denser and denser regions, in which the first stars eventually appeared, marking Cosmic Dawn.
As more stars formed, and the first galaxies formed, they flooded the universe with ultraviolet photons capable of ionize hydrogen gas. A few hundred million years after Cosmic Dawn, the first stars produced enough ultraviolet photons to re-ionize essentially all the universe's hydrogen atoms. This is called the Reionization era which is the hallmark event of this early generation of galaxies.
The beginning of structural complexity in the universe caused a remarkable transformation, but one that we have not yet looked into. By going even farther back than what the Hubble telescope can see, the truly first structures in the universe can be studied. Theoretical models suggest that present measurements are beginning to find the last part of Reionization, but the first stars and galaxies, in the Dark Ages and the Cosmic Dawn, currently lie above our understanding.
DARE will make the first measurements of the birth of the first stars and black holes and will measure the properties of the invisible stellar objects. Such observations are important for placing current measurements in a proper context, and to understand how the first galaxies grew from earlier generations of structures.

DARE's mission is to measure the shape of the redshifted 21-cm signal over a radio bandpass of 40–120 MHz, observing the redshift range 11–35, which correlate to 80–420 million years after the Big Bang. DARE orbits the Moon for 3 years and takes data above the lunar farside which is the only location in the inner Solar System proven to have no human-generated radio frequency problems.

The science instrument is set to a RF quiet spacecraft bus and is made of a three-element radiometer, including electrically-short, tapered, biconical dipole antennas, a receiver, and a digital spectrometer. The smooth frequency response of the antennas and different measurements used for DARE are important in removing the intense cosmic foregrounds so that the weak cosmic 21-cm signal can be detected.

Besides DARE, are other similar projects are proposed to also study this area such as the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER), Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), and the Large Aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages (LEDA).

Pornography addiction

Pornography addiction means someone is addicted to viewing porn. This addiction can be compulsive.

Demisexuality

A is a person who doesn't experience primary sexual attraction (based on sight or smell or other instantly available information).

Demisexuals do experience secondary sexual attraction (after knowing more about the person than just their looks), how much demisexuals need to know about said person and for how long they need to know about them for secondary sexual attraction to develop varies from person to person.

The term was coined in February 8, 2006 at the AVEN Forums by a member named “Sonofzeal”. Based on the theory that allosexuals experience both primary and secondary sexual attraction and asexuals don’t experience neither, based on the need for a term to describe those who experienced one but not the other they proposed the term demisexuals.

Demisexuality is also often mistaken as an admirable choice rather than an innate sexuality. Demisexuality also is not related to a moral or religious belief about sex. It is a sexual orientation, not a choice.

Royal Order of the Crown of Rwanda (Ikamba in the native Kinyarwandan language), the second-highest, non-religious, decoration/order for merit in the De jure Kingdom of Rwanda. It is the inheritor of ancient pagan tradition (the Gucana Uruti) envisioned by H.M. King Mutara III of Rwanda in 1950 and it was formally instituted by his successor, Kigeli V, in 1959.

This distinction granted the honoree the right to be treated as a member of the family of the reigning king. The decorated hero that had undergone Gucana Uruti was allowed to wear the crown of the Mwami (King) when the Mwami was seated and not using it.

The Order may be granted as a hereditary award or as a non-hereditary honor. Nobility is conferred upon the grantee. 

There are three ranks in the Order. The highest is the Grand Collar, followed by the Grand Cross, and the lowest rank is Commander. A recipient at the ranks of Grand Collar or Grand Cross is entitled to the style of "“Son Excellence”". A recipient at the rank of Commander is entitled to the style of "“L’honorable”".

Characters in the Super Smash Bros. series

The fighting game series "Super Smash Bros." from Nintendo was started in 1999. It features many video game characters from different series. There are over 80 playable characters across the series. Most of these are from series owned by Nintendo, but there are also some characters from series owned by other companies. There are also other non-player characters, such as enemies, bosses, and power-ups.

Each game in the series has a number of playable characters called "fighters". There are currently 86 fighters in the entire series. Starting with "Super Smash Bros. Brawl", characters from non-Nintendo series started being added. At the start of each game, some of the fighters will be hidden. To unlock a hidden fighter, players need to reach certain goals and then defeat that fighter in a match.

In "Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS" and "Wii U" and "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate", players can make their own Mii Fighters. Mii Fighters have costumes which can be unlocked or bought as downloadable content. Many of these costumes are based on characters and series which do not have playable characters, such as Heihachi Mishima from "Tekken", Sans from "Undertale", Cuphead from "Cuphead", Vault Boy from "Fallout" and Travis Touchdown from "No More Heroes". All games have fighters that share a lot of moves and properties with other characters, but with some small differences. In "Ultimate", these characters are called "Echo Fighters".

In "Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS", "Super Smash Bros. for Wii U", and "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate", some characters were released as downloadable content (DLC). This means that players have to buy them separately from the game itself.

Dual polyhedron

In geometry, every polyhedron is related to a dual polyhedron. The vertices (points) of one polyhedron match with the faces (flat surfaces) of the other. The edges connecting vertices in one polyhedron match with the edges connecting faces of the other. Starting with any given polyhedron, the dual of its dual is the original polyhedron.

Triangle center

In geometry, a triangle center is a point that can be called the middle of a triangle. There are many ways of measuring the center of a triangle, and each has a different name. On an equilateral triangle, every triangle center is the same, but on other triangles, the centers are different. Triangle centers may be inside or outside the triangle. Ancient Greek mathematicians discovered four: the centroid, circumcenter, incenter, and orthocenter. Today, mathematicians have discovered over 40,000 triangle centers. They are listed in the Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers, which is run by Clark Kimberling at the University of Evansville. 

A triangle center is a function of the three vertices (corners) of the triangle. Each triangle center has two properties in common.

1) Homogeneity: If the triangle is transformed while keeping similarity, (such as by translation, reflection, rotation, or dilation) the center will move in the same way as the triangle moves.

2) Bisymmetry: It must not be important to the function which vertex (corner) comes first, second, or third. For example, a center of points A, B, and C must be the same as that center of points A, C, and B.

If a triangle is not equilateral, then the centroid, orthocenter, circumcenter, and nine-point center form a line called the Euler line, named after Leonhard Euler.

Dilation (geometry)

In geometry, dilation (also called homothety or homothetic transformation) is the process which changes the size of a figure without changing its shape, a type of transformation. Any figure and its image after dilation are similar to each other.

Dilation is defined by a point V, the center of dilation, and a number k, the ratio. Given a point P in the plane, its image P' ("P prime") is on the line VP. The distance from P' to V is k times the distance from P to V.

Skinner's Sense of Snow

"Skinner's Sense of Snow" is the 8th episode of the 12th season of The Simpsons. It was first shown on the Fox network on December 17, 2000. The episode is about Springfield Elementary School being stuck in a snowstorm.

The episode's story came from an event in the episode writer's life. The episode takes place in winter. This made it harder for animators to make the animation of the episode. The episode makes references to "Smilla's Sense of Snow", "The Deer Hunter", and Kristi Yamaguchi.

The Simpson family go to a circus show called Cirque de Purée (a parody of Cirque du Soleil). However, a blizzard makes the circus have to stop. All of the schools (except the one Bart and Lisa go to) close because of the blizzard. Only some of the students go to the school during the blizzard. Seymour Skinner and Groundskeeper Willie are the only people in the school's faculty that came. Skinner puts a DVD in a movie projector. When the DVD gets set on fire, the school day ends. However, the blizzard causes snow to pile in front of the doors. Nobody in the school is able to leave now.

Skinner gives the students apples and relish to make sure they are not hungry. Nelson tries to get out of the school but Skinner will not let him. Skinner tries to get respect from the students in a way that is similar to the U.S. Army. Bart tries to make a tunnel in the snow so he can leave the school. Skinner breaks the tunnel but gets stuck inside of the snow. The students put Skinner in a big bag and take control of the school. 

Homer and Ned get in a car to drive to the school. Homer hits a fire hydrant with the car. The water from the fire hydrant freezes and makes them stuck inside. They start to get carbon monoxide poisoning from the large levels of carbon monoxide in the car. Skinner uses a hamster to get everyone out of the school. The hamster goes to Homer and Ned and breaks the car window. The car hits a salt silo that falls next to the school. The salt melts the snow, which makes the students now able to leave the school. Superintendent Chalmers finds the school in a bad condition and is angry at Skinner until Bart tells him about the blizzard. Homer starts to hallucinate from the carbon dioxide and sees Lisa as a camel.

"Skinner's Sense of Snow" was written by Tim Long. Lance Kramer is the director of the episode. The episode's story came from Long. One time while he was a child, a blizzard hit Exeter, Ontario. He was sad when he learned that every school was closed except for the one he went to. Long was also stuck in the school with his teachers because of snow. He said that "It was hellish, but then became a sweet thing". He also said that many dads used snowmobiles to give them food while inside the school. Matt Selman, a writer for the show, got the idea for the Simpson family to go to Cirque du Purée. This idea became the beginning of the episode's story.

The episode's director, Lance Kramer, wanted the animators of the episode to watch a Cieque du Soleil show. The animators did not watch one. Mike Scully thought that the animators did a great job on animating the circus show. The episode is set in the winter. This made it harder for animators to animate than it is for other episodes. Kramer said that "It just adds another element". He shows this by talking about episodes that are set in winter:
The particles on the film were put in by a post-production team. Scully said that the post-production team "never gets enough credit". When Homer and Ned drive to the school, the song "Feel Like Makin' Love" by Bad Company plays. The song "Rock and Roll All Nite" by Kiss was going to play but the show's staff did not get the permission to play it.

Mac McEntire from DVD Verdict thought that the episode was "outrageous" and a "standout" (better than others). He said that the comedy about the "cool kids versus dorky adults" is the best part of the episode. Matt Haigh of Den of Geek said that the episode is "gold" (good in quality). Elizabeth Skipper from DVD Verdict says that episodes with Principal Skinner are a "sure thing" and that this episode was "no exception". Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide called the episode "mediocre". He thought that the episode's story was not as good as it could have been.

Human sexual activity

Human sexual behavior refers to all the ways in which humans experience and live their sexuality. It includes acts done alone, for example masturbation, and acts done with a partner. Not all acts done with a partner are about sexual intercourse. All these acts usually result in sexual arousal. Human sexual activity can also include things done to find new partners, or to attract their attention (for example courtship).

Sexual activity has many different forms. Commonly, sexual activity involves foreplay, which is the act of making the partner feel good. Sexual activity can involve one or more people. Sexual activity may be different depending on the gender and sexual orientation of the people involved.

Some forms of sexual activity only involve one person, which is called autoeroticism. A person who does autoeroticism typically engages in sexual fantasy or masturbation. 

If two or more people are involved, they will do sexual activity with each other. Two partners can do vaginal sex, anal sex, or oral sex. Alternatively, they may do mutual masturbation, which is the act of masturbating each other. Penetrative sex between two people may be described as sexual intercourse.

If there are more than two people in a sex act, it may be referred to as group sex. 

People can use sex toys to make their sexual activity more enjoyable. Examples include dildos, vibrators, and butt plugs. Sex toys are usually used alone, but they can be used with partners too.

Some people have fetishes. This is a type of human sexual activity that involves body parts or objects that are not normally regarded as sexual. Fetishes of body parts (partialism) include the breasts, navel, and feet. Some people have fetishes for objects, such as shoes, clothing, lingerie, leather, and rubber. Some people with fetishes have a sexual interest in certain actions, such as choking. However, some fetishes can be dangerous, some of which may cause injury.

In order to have good human sexual activity, both partners must agree to do sexual activity, and they must be at least a certain age. This is called consent. If sexual activity is forced or threatened, it is considered rape or another form of sexual assault. In different cultures and countries, various sexual activities may be lawful or illegal depending on the person's age, gender, status of marriage, or other reasons related to the participants of sexual activity. Some countries don't have laws against certain types of sexual activity, even if the sexual activity does not agree with social norms or generally accepted sexual morals.

Xiaomi

Xiaomi Corporation (; ) is a Chinese multinational electronics company founded in April 2010 and headquartered in Beijing. Xiaomi makes and invests in smartphones, mobile apps, laptops, home appliances, bags, shoes, consumer electronics, and many other products. Xiaomi is also the fourth company in the world after Apple, Samsung and Huawei to have self-developed mobile phone chip capabilities.

Xiaomi released its first smartphone in August 2011 and rapidly gained market share in China to become the country's largest smartphone company in 2014. At the start of second quarter of 2018, Xiaomi was the world's fourth-largest smartphone manufacturer, leading in both the largest market, China, and the second-largest market, India. Xiaomi later developed a wider range of consumer electronics, including a smart home (IoT) product ecosystem, which has connected more than 100 million smart devices and appliances. Monthly active users (MAUs) of MIUI increased to 291.6 million in September 2019.

Xiaomi has 16,700 employees worldwide. It has expanded to other markets including Greater China, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Russia, South Africa and most countries and regions in Southeast Asia and Europe. According to "Forbes", Lei Jun, the founder and CEO, has an estimated net worth of US$12.5 billion. Xiaomi is the world's 4th most valuable technology start-up after receiving US$1.1 billion funding from investors, making Xiaomi's valuation more than US$46 billion. Ranked 468th, Xiaomi is the youngest company on Fortune Global 500 list for 2019. In 2019, Xiaomi's mobile phone shipments reached 125 million units, ranking fourth globally since 2018. The company has been listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since 2018.

"Xiaomi" () is the Chinese word for "millet". In 2011 its CEO Lei Jun suggested there are more meanings than just the "millet and rice. He linked the "Xiao" () part to the Buddhist concept that "a single grain of rice of a Buddhist is as great as a mountain," suggesting Xiaomi wants to work from the little things, instead of starting by striving for perfection, while "mi" () is an acronym for Mobile Internet and also Mission Impossible, referring to the obstacles encountered in starting the company. He also stated that he thinks the name is cute. In 2012 Lei Jun said that the name is about revolution and being able to bring innovation into a new area. Xiaomi's new 'Rifle' processor has given weight to several sources linking the latter meaning to the Communist Party of China's "millet and rifle" (小米加步枪) revolutionary idiom during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Lei Jun, Xiaomi's CEO, said that the company prices the phone almost at bill-of-material prices, without compromising the component quality and performance compared to other premium smartphones. It also profits by selling phone-related peripheral devices, smart home products, apps, online videos and themes. According to Xiaomi's Hugo Barra in 2014, the company sees hardware sales as a means of delivering software and services in the long term, "We are an Internet and a software company much more than a hardware company." However, financial data available at the time indicated that this is either wishful thinking or plans for the far future: 94% of the company's revenue came from mobile phone sales, an even higher proportion than Apple.

At first, to reduce overhead costs, Xiaomi did not own any physical stores, selling exclusively from its online store. In recent years, they have opened 54 brick and mortar stores to combat the strategies of other low-cost competitors in Chinese markets. It also did away with traditional advertising and relies on social networking services and word-of-mouth to publicize its products.

By keeping a tight control over its stock, Xiaomi is able to place cheaper batch orders as demand dictates. Limited availability flash sales ensure that supply never outstrips demand and helps promote its products. In contrast, traditional OEMs incur large upfront productions costs, which must be recouped by selling prices, in order to ship phones, some of which may not sell, out to retailers all around the world.

Xiaomi say that they listen closely to customer feedback, having them test out upcoming features themselves, and building an extensive online community. Lei Jun described it this way, "When I was with Kingsoft, I had the opportunity to work with Nokia and Motorola, two mobile phone giants of their time. One day, I pointed out to their R&D boss, some inadequacies. After that, they merely acknowledged my input but never acted upon what I had said. So I thought to myself, if I make a phone, you can tell me anything you wish for it or what's wrong. If it is justifiable, we will work on it immediately. I'll give you an update every week and you may even see your wishes come true within a week. In practice, Xiaomi's product managers spend a lot of time browsing through the company's user forums. Once a suggestion is picked up, it is quickly transferred to the engineers. Therefore, features can turn from a mere concept to shipping products within a week. The company then ships a new batch of phones out every week on Tuesday at noon Beijing time, containing the new software builds and possible minor hardware tweaks. Xiaomi calls this process "design as you build."

Xiaomi's mascot, Mitu, is a white rabbit wearing an Ushanka (known locally as a "Lei Feng hat" in China) with a red star and a red scarf around its neck.
POCO is a sub-brand owned by the Chinese electronics company Xiaomi Corporation. It was first announced in August 2018 as a mid-range smartphone line, and became a separate sub-brand of Xiaomi in 17 January 2020 with entry-level and mid-range devices, while Xiaomi itself produces upper-range and flagship Mi phones. POCO phones use the Xiaomi MIUI user interface on top of Android.

In Q4 of 2018, the POCO F1 reportedly become the best selling smartphone sold online in India, beating competition such as the OnePlus 6. The Pocophone was sometimes referred to as the "flagship killer killer" for offering high-end specifications at an affordable price. The first POCO phone was released in 2018 in India on Xiaomi's website. It instantly became a bestseller with 700,000 units sold until 6 December 2018, becoming the best selling smartphone sold online in India.

Xiaomi produces many products. Observers suggest that part of Xiaomi's rapid success rests on its ability to differentiate itself within the Android universe. The company has increased its range of products; its smartphones include: Mi Series, Mi Note Series (got a new update after 3 years, with the Mi Note 10 Pro), Mi Max Series, Mi Mix Series, Redmi and POCO Series. As well as mobile phones, Xiaomi has started selling wearables, mobile accessories, and appliances such as television and speakers. In 2018 it was selling tablets, laptops, and smart-home devices.

Xiaomi operates on a vertically-integrated model that enables the company to sell hardware at cost or below in order to attract users and earn money by selling content. Hugo Barra, a former Google executive who served Xiaomi's vice president from 2014 to 2017, characterized the organization as "an Internet and a software company much more than a hardware company".

Xiaomi also keeps its prices low or close to its manufacturing costs by keeping most of its products in the market longer, eighteen months rather than the six-month norm followed by many smartphone companies. Xiaomi said they sell their phones close to cost and intends to make profit on services.

The company's version of the Android operating system and MIUI skin, with its design, app marketplace, and functionalities, has established a community of users who form a crucial part of Xiaomi's customer base and contribute to the company's drive for market awareness. This ecosystem is a massive source of revenue as indicated in 2015, when sales from the platform reached $750 million.

The company focuses on India, the world's second-largest smartphone market. Xiaomi announced on 2 May 2018, the launch of Mi Music and Mi Video to offer "value-added internet services" in India. On 22 March 2017, Xiaomi announced that it planned to set up a second manufacturing unit in India in partnership with contract manufacturer Foxconn. On 7 August 2018, Xiaomi announced on its blog that Holitech Technology Co. Ltd., Xiaomi's top supplier, would invest up to $200 million over the next three years to set up a major new plant in India.

In 2019 Xiaomi started to sell simple goods such as sunglasses, caps, pillows, glass lunchboxes, cups, filters, bags, backpacks, luggage, screwdrivers, and umbrellas.

In April 2019, researchers at Check Point found a security breach in Xiaomi phone apps. The security flaw was reported to be preinstalled.

In 2019, the company announced that it would launch more than 10 5G phones in 2020, some of them being: Mi 10/10 Pro with 5G functionality included.

In March 2020, Xiaomi showcased its new 40W wireless charging solution, which was able to fully charge a smartphone with a 4,000mAh battery from flat in 40 minutes.

In December 2020, Xiaomi collaborates with award-winning photographer Steve McCurry, to promote the photographic capabilities of the Mi 10T Pro handset. The brand’s ‘My Unsung Hero’ campaign features images captured on the Mi 10T Pro. 
Xiaomi was unfavorably covered for its non-compliance with the terms of the GNU GPL. The Android project's Linux kernel is licensed under the copyleft terms of the GPL, which requires Xiaomi to distribute the complete source code of the Android kernel and device trees for every Android device it distributes. By refusing to do so, or by unreasonably delaying these releases, Xiaomi is operating in violation of intellectual property law in China, as a WIPO state. Prominent Android developer Francisco Franco publicly criticized Xiaomi's behaviour after repeated delays in the release of kernel source code. Xiaomi in 2013 said that it would release the kernel code. The kernel source code is available on the GitHub website.

Xiaomi has been compared to the American corporation Apple Inc., as reviewers found some of Xiaomi's phones and tablets similar in appearance to Apple's. In addition, the marketing strategy of Xiaomi is at times described as riding on the back of the "cult of Apple". It is reported that, after reading a book about Steve Jobs in college, Xiaomi's chairman and CEO, Lei Jun, carefully cultivated a Steve Jobs image, including jeans, dark shirts, and Jobs's announcement style at Xiaomi's earlier product announcements. Given the above, he was categorized as a "counterfeit Jobs."

In 2012, the company was said to be counterfeiting Apple's philosophy and mindset. In 2013, critics debated how much of Xiaomi's products were innovative, and how much of their innovation was just really good public relations. Others point out that while there are similarities to Apple, the ability to customize the software based upon user preferences through the use of Google's Android operating system sets Xiaomi apart.

In November 2012, Xiaomi's smart set-top box stopped working one week after the launch due to the company having run afoul of China's State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television. The regulatory issues were overcome in January 2013.

In August 2013, the company announced that it was hiring Hugo Barra from Google, where he served as vice president of product management for the Android platform. Barra has declined to comment on the timing of the Google relationships, and stated that he had been in talks with Xiaomi for over a year prior to announcing the move. He was employed as vice president of Xiaomi to expand the company outside of mainland China, making Xiaomi the first company selling smartphones to poach a senior staffer from Google's Android team. Barra's focus was to help Xiaomi grow internationally.

Barra quit his position in January 2017 to join Facebook as VP of virtual reality.

Xiaomi's cloud storage service Mi Cloud stores all user data in its servers in China. As a company based in China, it is must share data with the Chinese government under the China Internet Security Law and National Intelligence Law. Xiaomi's Cloud messaging service sent some private data, including call logs and contact information, to Xiaomi servers. Xiaomi later released an MIUI update that made cloud messaging optional and that no private data was sent to Xiaomi servers if the cloud messaging service was turned off.

In October 2014, Xiaomi announced that they were setting up servers outside of China for international users, citing improved services and compliance to regulations in several nations. Around the same time, the Indian Air Force warned against Xiaomi phones, stating that they were a national threat as they sent user data to an agency of the Chinese government.

On 30 April 2020, Forbes reported that Xiaomi extensively tracks use of its browsers, including private browser activity, phone metadata, and device navigation, and more alarmingly, without secure encryption or anonymization, more invasively and to a greater extent than mainstream browsers. Xiaomi disputed the claims, while affirming that it did extensively collect browsing data, and claiming that the data was not linked to any individuals and that consumers had consented to being tracked. Xiaomi later posted a response stating that the collection of aggregated usage statistics data is used for internal analysis, and would not link any personally identifiable information to any of this data. However after a followup by the report's originator, Gabriel Cirlig, Xiaomi backed down and added an option to completely stop the information leak when using their browser in incognito mode.

The Taiwanese Fair Trade Commission had investigated the flash sales and found that Xiaomi had sold fewer smartphones than advertised. In December 2014, three flash sales were investigated. In those flash sales Xiaomi claimed that the number of smartphones sold was 10,000 units each for the first two sales, and 8,000 units for the third one. However, FTC investigated the claims and found that Xiaomi sold 9,339 devices in the first flash sale, 9,492 units in the second one, and 7,389 for the third. It was found that during the first flash sale, Xiaomi had given 1,750 priority ‘F-codes’ to people who could place their orders without having to go through the flash sale, thus diminishing the stock that was publicly available. The FTC fined Xiaomi .

On 9 December 2014, the High Court of Delhi granted an ex parte injunction that banned the import and sale of Xiaomi products in India. The injunction was issued in response to a complaint filed by Ericsson in connection with the infringement of its patent licensed under FRAND (Fair, Reasonable and Non Discriminatory Licensing). The injunction was applicable until 5 February 2015, the date on which the High Court was scheduled to summon both parties for a formal hearing of the case. On 16 December, the High Court granted permission to Xiaomi to sell its devices running on a Qualcomm-based processor until 8 January 2015. Following that, Xiaomi held various sales on Flipkart, including one on 30 December 2014. Following that sale, the company received press coverage after its flagship Xiaomi Redmi Note 4G phone sold out in six seconds. A judge extended the division bench's interim order, allowing Xiaomi to continue the sale of Qualcomm chipset-based handsets until March 2018.

On 27 June 2020, CAIT - the Confederation of All India Traders - criticized Manu Kumar Jain, Xiaomi global vice president and managing director of Xiaomi India, for disrespecting the sentiments of Indian citizens, after he claimed a "Boycott Chinese Products" campaign was the result of mob mentality.

In April 2019, Indian security researcher Arif Khan discovered a security vulnerability affecting the Indian and certain global versions of MIUI's native browser application - Mi Browser and Mint Browser, which is also developed by Xiaomi, both of which were based on the same browser engine, which was bypassed more than 2 times subsequently after Xiaomi fixed it. Khan also found a URL Address Bar Spoofing vulnerability affecting only the Indian and certain overseas versions but not the Chinese version. Again in the same month, Khan reportedly found another major lock screen bypass vulnerability affecting only the Indian version of MIUI which was using Glance, which allowed exfiltration of sensitive user data despite MIUI's lock screen protection, which was eventually fixed by Xiaomi after several media reports. These events led to various speculations about the company's motives, and approach concerning the privacy and security of its users in its Indian and overseas markets.

Marcel Mauss

Marcel Mauss (May 10, 1872 - February 10, 1950) was a French anthropologist and sociologist. With a strong background in sociology, he began using ethnography to look at how different cultures build relationships. He was also influenced by his nephew, another famous anthropologist, Émile Durkheim. Mauss is known for his work on gifts and exchange, magic, sacrifice, the body, and comparing cultures. Mauss’s most famous work is "The Gift". "The Gift" is about the ways gifts and exchanges build relationships. Mauss is also known for influencing structural anthropologists such as Claude Lévi-Strauss.

Marcel Mauss was born in Épinal, France in 1872. His parents were Gerson Mauss and Rosine (Durkheim) Mauss. He was raised in a non-observant Jewish family.

In the early 1890s, Mauss went to the University of Bordeaux where he studied many subjects including religion and philosophy. Later he moved to Paris, France where he studied at the École Pratique des Hautes Études (an important French research school). In Paris, Mauss studied Sanskrit, Hebrew, history of religion, and other topics. Mauss eventually became a professor at École Pratique des Hautes Études. He taught about many different religions.

During World War I, Mauss served in the French army as an interpreter.

Mauss helped form the Institut d'ethnologie (Ethnology Institute) at the University of Paris in 1925 with Paul Rivet and Lucien Lévy-Bruhl. He also was the chair of the sociology department at the Université de Paris from 1931-1939.

Mauss’s theories about the role of gifts in Māori culture relied heavily on the information provided by Tamati Ranapiri. Ranapiri was a Māori scholar who exchanged letters with ethnographer Elsdon Best. Through these letters, Ranapiri explained how gifts were used to connect people in Māori society. According to Ranapiri, gifts created commitment without force. These commitments created by gifts made social relationships and bonds stronger.

Elsdon Best was an enthographer who studied the Māori people of New Zealand. Mauss used Best’s letters and primary data to write his work about Māori gift giving.

Émile Durkheim was Marcel Mauss’s uncle as well as a professional influence. The two worked together on many projects. Durkheim and Mauss worked together to publish the book "Primitive Classifications." This book was a response to Immanuel Kant’s categories of understanding. Durkheim and Mauss also worked together to publish articles in "L’Année Sociologique". "L’Année Sociologique" was a sociology journal created by Durkheim.

Mauss referred to Hubert as his "Siamese twin" and is also a co-author of many of Marcel's works. In works that they are not co-authored, they cite each other. As Mauss said "[e]verything I don't know, Mauss knows, and everything Mauss doesn't know, I know." Their major works and theories were products of their teamwork, and therefore both greatly influenced each other.

"The Gift" was published in 1925. It was written partially in response to the Bolshevik Revolution. In this book, Mauss argued that every society has both markets and money of some kind as well as altruism. Mauss claims that gifts are a “total social fact” which have spiritual parts to them. "The Gift" also examines gift giving traditions of some indigenous peoples. Mauss writes about the Māori idea of “Hau." He also talks about Potlatch, which was first practiced by indigenous groups in North America. Mauss believed that gift giving can tell us a lot about social relationships. He also believed that gift giving was connected to power. Mauss claimed that there is no such thing as a free gift. He thought every gift was part of an ongoing system of giving and receiving.

Mauss saw sacrifice as a system of exchange as well. In 1899, Mauss published "Sacrifice: Its Nature and Functions" with Henri Hubert. This book compares many religious practices with a focus on sacrifice and the body. Mauss and Hubert compared religions from many places and time periods. They describe sacrifice as a system which involves both actions that are aimed towards a holy person or object and actions that are aimed away from a holy person or object. Mauss and Hubert claimed that the body is the result of many different habits and qualities. They claimed that a person is made up of certain actions that are performed through specific behaviors.

Mauss teamed up with Hubert again in 1902 to publish "A General Theory of Magic". In this book, Mauss and Hubert claimed that social events, rather than individual people, were magic. This is another cross-cultural comparison, like Mauss and Hubert's work on sacrifice. They claim that magic is a social experience. The book examines the relationships between magic and religion, science, and technology. Mauss and Hubert also trace the long-lasting impact of magic on our modern ideas, such as the idea of good and bad luck.

"Manual of Ethnography" is a collection of Mauss's lectures on how to successfully do ethnography. Ethnography is when sociologists and anthropologists try to understand a culture through observing and sometimes participating in that group. In his lectures, he shows that observers should not assume that a culture will have the same opinions and ways of doing things as their own culture. He also describes how ethnographers should observe, collect data, and how to understand the different social structures that make up a group.

"Saints, Heroes, Myths, and Rites" is a collection of essays written by Mauss, Hubert and Hertz. Like Durkheim, they believed that as people started practicing their own religions, people would find new ways to maintain a sense of community based on their shared morals. Myths are also part of religion. They are a result of any human society. Because they are found in every society, they are not imaginary. Myths are subconscious symbols that the individual uses to understand their experiences. The subconscious is also called the unconscious. It is the part of a person's mind that thinks and remembers things without the person knowing it.

In 2017, Georgina Stewart published a criticism "The Gift", specifically on Mauss' understanding of Hau. Stewart claims that a misunderstanding of Māori beliefs about the cosmos and language differences caused Mauss to misunderstand the Māori concept of Hau. Alain Testart (1998) claimed that Mauss exaggerated the idea that all gifts need to be repaid. Testart said that there were some truly free gifts, such as giving money to a homeless person as you walk by them. James Laidlaw also points out an example of free gifts within Jainism, a religion where followers believe that they cause a war between microorganisms if they prepare their own food, so they rely on outside food donations.

Mauss is credited for being a major inspiration for Claude Lévi-Strauss. Claude Lévi-Strauss went on to develop the structuralist view of cultural anthropology. Mauss also inspired other structuralists such as Pierre Bourdieu. Mauss is also known for inspiring future work on topics such as exchange theory and economic anthropology. Mauss' cross-cultural comparisons were radical for his time, and he set the stage for the next generation of cultural anthropologists to use a similar comparative approach.

Mauss' "The Gift" inspired French philosopher Georges Bataille to understand how money is increasingly being wasted in society. His influence has also appeared in French sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu's works. In them, he highlight's Mauss's idea of habitus. Habitus describes habits and skills that we learn while being within our society. These are ingrained in us and influence the way we perceive and react to the world around us. Someone with a similar upbringing might have similar habitus.

OxygenOS

OxygenOS () - OS on base Android, developed by a Chinese smartphone manufacturer OnePlus exclusively for their smartphones. OxygenOS was developed for the global marketplace. There is also another version of the OS developed specifically for the China market called HydrogenOS.

In an interview published by 3 September 2016, developers XDA found that OnePlus "actively combines both platforms (OxygenOS and HydrogenOS) into a single cohesive operating system".

Notable features of versions 2.0 and 2.1.1 include permissions Program, Waves MaxxAudio, SwiftKey keyboard, screen gestures, custom icons, dark mode, manual camera mode, and RAW support for third-party apps like Camera FV-5 2.75.

On 14 June 2016, OnePlus released OxygenOS 3.0. This is the version Android with several modifications and internal customizations like gestures, a shell and a dark mode from OnePlus.

On 31 December 2016, OnePlus released OxygenOS 4.0.0 based on Android Nougat and includes its features and several other modifications to the general public through downloads via OTA.

On 31 January 2018, OnePlus released OxygenOS 5.0.3 based on Android Oreo to the general public through OTA downloads. In May 2018, OnePlus released OnePlus 6 with OxygenOS based on Android Oreo 8.1.

On 29 October 2018, OnePlus released the OnePlus 6T from OxygenOS 9.0 based on Android Pie.

On 25 December 2018, OnePlus released OxygenOS 9.0.0 based on Android Pie for OnePlus 5/5T to the general public via OTA.

On 14 October 2020, OnePlus released The OxygenOS 11 based on Android 11 for OnePlus 8T models and other 8 series models. They introduced many features such as AOD (Always on Display) and One Handed Mode Better Experience. OxygenOS's latest version is faster, smoother, and smarter than ever.
On 10 October 2017, a security researcher discovered that OxygenOS system service called "DeviceManagerService" collects sensitive data and transmits it back to OnePlus servers. The service collects many data points, including the serial number of the device, the phone number, IMEI, network connections and time records of user activity in each application. Users can delete the system service through ADB. OnePlus later released a statement on data collection and analytics, arguing that the data is only used to improve and optimize the system, is not shared with third parties and can be disabled by users in system settings. OnePlus also says they are reviewing the data analysis mechanism and no longer collecting certain data.

In 2014, OnePlus promised the experience is "close to pure Android, without bloation and with great customization capabilities." Soon they held a contest "Name the firmware" in search of a name. On 30 January 2015, OnePlus officially announced the names OxygenOS and HydrogenOS. The winner of this @Midifire from Belgium was taken to the headquarters in Shenzhen, where he met with the team with their general manager Pete Lau.

OnePlus 5T

The OnePlus 5T is an Android-based smartphone produced, released and marketed by OnePlus. It was unveiled on 16 November 2017 via a live streamed press event which aired on YouTube, It went on sale on 21 November 2017. It is an incremental update to its predecessor, the OnePlus 5, which was unveiled only five months prior. Some notable changes that are featured, includes, a larger display and thinner bezels found on the device with the repositioning of the fingerprint scanner from the front to the rear panel. On 17 May 2018 the OnePlus 5T was succeeded by the OnePlus 6.

The OnePlus 5T features a redesigned 6.01" Full Optic 2160x1080 AMOLED display, which the company calls the "Sunlight display" and claims to provide a crisp and bright experience even when used in a sunny environment, such as when outdoors. The display uses the 18:9 (2:1) aspect ratio instead of the 16:9 aspect ratio found in most smartphones, and supports the DCI-P3 wide color gamut standard. It also has a pixel density of 401ppi, and features smaller bezels than found in previous OnePlus smartphones such as the OnePlus 5 and 3T. The 5T's body is made entirely from anodized aluminum, uses 2.5D Gorilla Glass 5 as protection for the display, and uses a ceramic coating for the fingerprint sensor which was moved to the rear of the phone. It also features an "Alert Slider" located on the left side of the device, a feature that is also available on its predecessors, the 5, the 3T, and the 3, which allows users to set their notifications to silent. The 5T is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 and comes with the choice of either 6 or 8 GB of LPDDR4X RAM, depending on the storage configuration. Similar to its predecessor, the phone is available in either a 64GB or 128GB configuration.

Unlike OnePlus devices released in the past, the phone does not feature any physical hardware buttons on the front of the device, electing to use virtual navigation keys instead. It features a non-removable 3,300 mAh battery, capable of fast charging by OnePlus' proprietary Dash Charge through its USB-C port. The phone retains the 3.5mm headphone jack, but lacks stereo speakers, instead opting for a mono speaker located on the bottom of the device. The device features a combination of a 16 MP main lens (Sony Exmor IMX398) and a 20 MP secondary lens (Sony Exmor IMX376K) located on the device's rear, both of which have an aperture of f/1.7. They are capable of shooting 4K video and "Portrait mode" shots, like many other flagship devices. The front (selfie) camera is also a 16 MP sensor, with an aperture of f/2.0. The 5T features a "Face Unlock" facial recognition feature that can be used to unlock the device, however it lacks the ability to authenticate purchases. Since it uses 2D scanning, it is relatively faster than some other competitors, but doesn't work in particular lighting conditions and is not as secure.

The OnePlus 5T has become available in multiple limited edition variants over time, such as a Star Wars edition promoting , which came with a special case and a new color scheme; a "Sandstone White" variant which was released on 5 January 2018 and featured a white color scheme and a red "Alert Slider", which sold out in under 2 hours; and a "Lava Red" variant which was released on 11 January 2018 initially in India, and became available in Europe and North America on 6 February.

The OnePlus 5T ships with Android 7.1.1 "Nougat" and uses the OxygenOS user interface, OnePlus' proprietary custom skin built on top of Android, adding various features not found in the stock Android operating system, such as night mode and reading mode, which both change the color temperature of the device's screen, and the ability to change the Bluetooth audio codec. The night mode reduces the screen's color temperature to reduce blue light levels, while the reading mode applies a monochrome-like effect to the screen. Unlike the OnePlus 5, the 5T no longer overrides the performance scaling in benchmarks to max out CPU and GPU clocks in specific applications, this makes benchmarks being run on the 5T more accurate.

OnePlus promised an update to Android 8 "Oreo" (OxygenOS 5.0) in early 2018. The first beta for this version was released on 29 December 2017, but was pulled a couple days later due to issues with regards to instability that were present. OnePlus fixed the issues and reuploaded the beta version on 3 January 2018.

The first stable Android Oreo-based version of OxygenOS (OxygenOS 5.0.2) for the OnePlus 5T was released on 31 January 2018, introducing features such as Picture-in-Picture, Autofill, and Notification Dots, as well as a faster boot time. The update also introduced a redesigned Quick Settings menu, introduces a security patch for CVE-2017-13218, and updates a few system applications. The update does not contain the Treble feature for device independent system updates. On 11 March 2018, OnePlus released the Android 8.1 "Oreo" update in beta for the OnePlus 5 and the OnePlus 5T, bringing the changes made to Android 8.1 such as the Neural Networks and Shared memory APIs, the dimming of the navigation bar when it is not being used to the devices, and other improvements, such as improvements to the Autofill framework. The update also updated the security patch level to 1 February 2018. In Q2 2020 The OnePlus 5 and 5T got their stable Android 10 updates with OxygenOS 

The OnePlus 5T includes only a single variant for cellular networks worldwide.
OnePlus 5T received generally positive reviews. "The Verge" was full praise for the phone's elegant design and optimized software but noted that the camera was still mediocre. Engadget heaped praise on the phone for its excellent performance despite its price bracket.

This special edition sells for ₹23990.

Big Rip

In physical cosmology, the Big Rip is a theory which describes the ultimate fate of the universe. According to this theory, everything in the universe, even spacetime itself will be torn apart by the expansion of the universe until distances between particles will become infinite. According to the standard model of cosmology the scale factor of the universe is known to be accelerating and, in the future era it will increase more rapidly. However, this expansion is similar for every moment of time (hence the exponential law – the expansion of a local volume is the same number of times over the same time interval), and is identified by an unchanging, small Hubble constant which is ignored by any bound material structures. Similarly in the Big Rip scenario the Hubble constant increases to infinity in a finite time.

The possibility of sudden rip singularity occurs only for hypothetical matter (phantom energy) but it is unlikely to occur in physical properties.

The truth of the hypothesis relies on the type of dark energy present in our universe. The type that could prove this hypothesis is a constantly increasing form of dark energy, known as phantom energy. If the dark energy in the universe increases without limit, it could destroy all forces that hold the universe together. The key value is the equation of state parameter "w", the ratio between the dark energy pressure and its energy density. If -1 < "w" < 0, the expansion of the universe continues to increase, but the dark energy tends to stop over time. So the Big Rip does not happen. Phantom energy has "w" < −1, which means that its density increases as the universe expands.

A universe with more phantom energy is an accelerating universe, expanding at an ever-increasing rate. However, this implies that the size of the observable universe and the particle horizon is continually getting smaller — the distance at which objects are moving away at the speed of light from an observer becomes ever closer, and the distance over which interactions can propagate becomes ever shorter. When the size of the particle horizon becomes smaller than any particular structure, no interaction by any of the fundamental forces can occur between the farthest parts of the structure, and the structure is "ripped apart". The progression of time itself will stop. The model says that after a finite time there will be a final singularity, called the "Big Rip", in which the observable universe will reach zero size and all distances will reach into infinite value.

The authors of this hypothesis, led by Robert R. Caldwell of Dartmouth College, calculate the time from the present to the Big Rip to be

where "w" is defined above, "H" is Hubble's constant and "Ω" is the present value of the density of all the matter in the universe.

However, observations of the galaxy cluster speeds by the Chandra X-ray Observatory seem to tell that the value of "w" is approximately −0.991, meaning the Big Rip will not happen 

The authors consider a hypothetical example with "w" = −1.5, "H" = 70 km/s/Mpc, and "Ω" = 0.3, in which case the Big Rip would happen approximately 22 billion years from the present. In this scenario, galaxies would first be separated from each other about 200 million years before the Big Rip. About 60 million years before the Big Rip, galaxies would begin to break up as small parts as gravity becomes too weak to hold them together. Planetary systems like the Solar System would become gravitationally unbound and all planets will be separated from their orbit in about three months before the Big Rip. Planets would fly off into the rapidly expanding universe. In the last minutes, stars and planets would be torn apart, and the now dispersed atoms would be destroyed about 10 seconds before the end. At the time the Big Rip occurs, even spacetime itself would be ripped apart and the scale factor would be infinity.

Evidence indicates "w" to be very close to −1 in our universe, which makes "w" the dominating term in the equation. The closer that "w" is to −1, the closer the denominator is to zero and the further the Big Rip is in the future. If "w" were exactly equal to −1, the Big Rip could not happen, regardless of the values of "H" or "Ω".

According to the latest cosmological data available, it is still unsure which one is correct, "w" < −1, "w" = −1, and "w" > −1.

Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan

The Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan (Kurdish: كۆمه‌ڵه‌ی شۆڕشگێڕی زه‌حمه‌تكێشانی كوردستانی ئێران, written in Western letters: Komełey Şorrişgêrrî Zehmetkêşanî Kurdistanî Êran), is a social democratic political party from the Kurdish region of Iran. Komala has been seeking a nonreligious democratic federal ruling system to replace the current government, which is run by religious people. This party is currently exiled in northern Iraq, where its leaders work from. Komala is a member of the International Socialist and Progressive Alliance. This is an organization that has many different social democrats, socialist, and progressive groups. Komala wants to make laws against sexual violence and to protect children during armed conflicts. Komala also wants to make laws against anti-personnel land mines.

The Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan started in 1969, among Kurdish leftist students and intellectuals in Tehran and some Kurdish towns. Since there was no political freedom in Iran, every political organization and even small student circles had to go into hiding and organize underground. Komala was no exception. Like all other opposition organizations of that time, especially the leftist groups of the sixties and seventies, Komala faced severe repression.

During those years many of Komala's members and its leadership experienced persecution, torture and imprisonment in the hands of , Shah’s notorious secret police, but Komala managed to survive and protect the main body of its organization and its growing network of activists. More than 9 years of hard and disciplined work prior to the outbreak of Iranian Revolution of 1978-79, bore its fruit and helped Komala build a strong and cohesive body of cadres among sections of Kurdish society. Komala managed to win over considerable amounts of Kurdish students, teachers, intellectuals and young people and to develop a significant influence and social base among workers and peasants throughout Kurdistan.

Komala actively participated in the Iranian Revolution and in fact was behind almost every demonstration and popular movement of that period. On March 16, 1979, a few days after the victory of the Revolution, Komala launched an open political party. By this time Komala had already become a major political force in Iranian Kurdistan. The birth of Komala and its rapid growth among large sections of Kurdish society in Iran, apart from its own hard work, discipline and dedication, can be attributed to a combination of social factors during a period of Iran’s transition from a traditional and patriarchal society to a so-called pseudo-modern one.

After a long and heated debate among its ranks and in public during the 1990s, finally the majority of the Komala Party’s cadres and members decided on a renewal programme to adapt to new domestic and global developments. Since year 2000, Komala Party has undergone a major overhaul. This move was welcomed by the great majority of people, intellectuals, students, women, civil activists, Komala veteran activists and others.

While preserving its socialist values, Komala fights for Kurdish rights, a democratic secular pluralist federal Iran, social justice, democratic labour laws, the freedom of assembly and organization, political freedoms, democracy, human rights, women’s rights and cultural and religious tolerance.

Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan is currently a consultative member of the International Socialist, a worldwide organization for progressive forces including social democrats, socialists and labor parties to gather under.

Survival sex

People who are very poor and who cannot even cover their basic needs, such as getting a place where they live, or food, sometimes trade sexual intercourse to cover these needs. This practice is called survival sex. The term is used by sex trade, poverty researchers, and aid workers. Very often, people who engage in survival sex are homeless. Sometimes, survival sex is used to get illegal drugs. 

Survival sex is common throughout the world. It has been studied in many countries including the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Philippines, Thailand, New Zealand, Colombia, Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa.

Researchers estimate that of homeless youth in North America, one in three has engaged in survival sex. In one study of homeless youth in Los Angeles, about one-third of females and half of males said they had engaged in survival sex. People who have been homeless for a longer time, who have become victims, or who have become criminals are more likely to engage in survival sex. This is also true for people who have attempted suicide, who are pregnant, or those who have a STI.

Survival sex is common in refugee camps. In Uganda, 1.4 million civilians have been displaced by conflicts between Ugandan government forces and the militant Lord's Resistance Army. Many of them live in refugee camps in northern Uganda. Human Rights Watch reported in 2005 that displaced women and girls in these camps were engaging in survival sex with other camp residents, local defense personnel, and Ugandan government soldiers.

Geology of Australia

The geology of Australia records over 3.8 billion years of the Earth's history. Australia is a continent on the Indo-Australian Plate. It is immensely old, and has rocks of many different types.

Like its close neighbour, New Guinea, Australia was once part of the southern supercontinent of Gondwanaland. Geologically, they are on the same tectonic plate. When world sea levels were low, the two shared shorelines (which now lie 100 to 140 metres below sea level). They combined with lands now under water, sometimes known as Greater Australia. The two huge countries became separated when the area now known as the Torres Strait flooded after the end of the last glacial period. Big as Australia is, it was much bigger in the past. The end of the last ice age saw sea levels rise, and the old connections were broken.

The main continental blocks of the Australian continent are;


Around them are several Proterozoic volcanic belts and sedimentary basins. The cratons formed the greater Australian landmass in the late Archaean to mesoProterozoic, (~2400 mya to 1,600 mya).


The older, western, two-thirds of the continent is much thicker (over 200 km thick) than the eastern third (about 38 to 59 km thick). The continental crust is mainly made of Archaean, Proterozoic and some Palaeozoic granites and gneisses. A thin veneer of mainly Phanerozoic sedimentary basins cover much of the Australian landmass (these are up to 7 km thick).

Many meteorite craters have been found in Australia, but few have yet been confirmed.

The Earth Impact Database lists 190 confirmed craters, of which Australia has 27. The largest is the Yarrabubba crater in mid Western Australia. Its estimated age is 2.229 billion years ago. It is one of the oldest known impact structures on Earth.

Abdulla Mohtadi

Abdullah Mohtadi (born 1949 in Bukan, Iran) is the leader of the Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan. As a politician, he has played a prominent role in the Kurdish resistance struggle against the Iranian regime. Abdullah Mohtadi is also a member of the board of Iran's Transitional Council (ITC). In the international media, Abdulla Mohtadi is known as a political analyst of the Middle East, especially ongoing affairs of Iran and Iranian Kurdistan.

As of 2020, Iran is an Islamic republic, where Islamic leaders play an important role. Mohtadi wants to establish a secular state. He has called for democratic reforms. He also called for a society that respects many different opinions; this idea is known as pluralism.

Despite all the efforts to remain in secrecy, in the 1970s, Mohtadi was arrested three times. The last time he was arrested, Abdullah was sentenced to more than three years' imprisonment for his activism against the Shah regime. Since SAVAK was unable to provide any evidence regarding Mohtadi's political actions, he was released from prison and now, his party should cope with its most important era of the pre-Islamic Revolution Iran. When Ayatollah Khomeini ordered a massive onslaught against Iranian Kurds in August 1979, Mohtadi emerged as a leader of the Kurdish resistance movement.

Basic needs

There have been several classifications of the needs of a person. While these classifications vary, they commonly place the basic needs at the lowest level. Basic needs are those that must be satisfied, to guarantee survival. According to Abraham Maslow these include:


If these needs are not met the human body cannot function properly. Maslow considered physiological needs the most important of all. Maslow doesn't clearly say which of these are basic needs.

Absolute poverty has been defined as being unable to satisfy basic needs, or spending most of the income on satisfying those needs.

SD Compostela

SD Compostela is a football club which plays in Spain.

Founded in 1928, Compostela spent the better part of that and the following decades playing professional football. On October 28, 1962, the newly formed SD Compostela merged with the Club Arenal. The decade of the 1970s was irregular. The team played in the Tercera División, in the Regional category and in the new Segunda División B. Its first promotion to a semi-national stage occurred in 1977, with a promotion to Segunda División B (Group 1), which lasted just one season; "Compos" promoted again in 1980, this time lasting six years.

Relegation in 1986 was compounded by off-field controversy surrounding the actions of then president Francisco Steppe. He resigned amid allegations of receipt of payments to throw a game against Pontevedra CF, which would assure the opposition's maintenance in the category. The late 1980s saw a significant restructuring of the club both at board and management levels and, in 1990, Compostela regained third-level status.

The following campaign was to prove the club's most successful to date. On 23 June 1991, a capacity crowd of 8,000 at the "Estadio Municipal Santa Isabel", saw goals from Juanito and Ochoa (two) clinch a 3–1 victory in the final play-off match against CD Badajoz, for a first-ever Segunda División visit.

The move to "Estadio Multiusos de San Lázaro" coincided with the continuing rise in the team's fortunes and, at the end of 1993–94, following a 3–1 play-off victory against Rayo Vallecano, Compostela reached La Liga. Compostela did remarkably well, and reached a best finish of 10th in 1995–96, mainly courtesy of strikers Christopher Ohen and Bent Christensen, whom totalled 23 league goals.

After four seasons at the top, Compostela was relegated after losing a relegation play-off match to Villarreal CF on the away goals rule, despite playing overall attractive football. The club was also about to start a downward spiral; after a relegation to the third level in 2001 the team returned the following year but, in the following campaign, played to a backdrop of off-field distractions, with the players and staff going unpaid for months – a final ninth place was not enough to prevent another relegation, as the club failed to meet the 31 July deadline to settle all wage debts.

Pampas cat

The pampas cat or gato de las pampas ("Leopardus pajeros" or "Leopardus colocolo") is a small wild cat that lives in the Andes mountain range. They live in Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Uruguay, Brazil, Ecuador, and Colombia. Some scientists think this cat is really three species, "L. colocolo", "L. braccatus", and "L. pajeros". Other scientists think they are all one species.

This cat lives in many kinds of habitats: cloud forests, swamps, scrublands, and grasslands.

This cat mostly eats small rodents such as guinea pigs and mice, but they also catch birds, for example flamingoes. Scientists saw pampas cats going to penguin nests to eat eggs and baby penguins. Farmers say that this cat can kill goats and chickens.

In most of the countries where the pampas cat lives, it is illegal to kill one. The pampas cat is in danger of dying out because humans are using or want to use the land that it lives on for farms. Indigenous people of the South America like the pampas cat because it is a sign of fertility and they believe killing a pampas cat brings bad luck. But the same people also like to have a dead pampas cat's skin or whole body for ceremonies.

This cat's body is 42 to 79 cm long and its tail is another 22 to 33 cm long. It can weigh 3 to 4 kg. Its fur is thick and long. It can be pale yellow to dark gray-brown or dark dull red in color. It can have stripes or spots or not. It almost always has rings on its legs and tail.
The first visual recordings of the pampas cat, a movie and photos, were made in 2006.

Trace radioisotope

A trace radioisotope is a radioactive isotope of an element which exists naturally in tiny amounts (i.e. traces). Generally speaking, trace radioisotopes have half-lives much shorter than the age of the Earth.

Trace radioisotopes occur in the atmosphere and the crust of the Earth. They are constantly produced by natural processes such as cosmic ray fission: high-energy cosmic ray striking atoms and causing them to split into smaller nuclei). 

Another mechanism is neutron capture in uranium ores causing the production of nuclei such as uranium-236 and plutonium-239, which are both radioactive isotopes. Spontaneous fission and alpha decay of heavy nuclei such as thorium and uranium also produce radioisotopes in traces as their intermediate decay products.

Net run rate

Net run rate (NRR) is a number used in cricket to decide which of two teams is better, if both teams are equal on points gotten from winning games during a competition (i.e. they may have won and lost an equal number of games during a World Cup). It is calculated using the difference between the number of runs scored by a team and its opponents, while dividing each of these by the number of legal deliveries (in batches of 6 i.e. the number of overs) that team and its opponents have each batted throughout all of the games involving that team in the competition. This calculation does not look at how many times each team's batsmen have gotten out, so it gives teams that score many runs very quickly an advantage even if they have more batsmen get out than their opponents.

As an example, if a team wins a game 300 runs to 200, with it having batted 200 legal deliveries (33.2 overs, meaning 33 overs and 2 deliveries, or 33 overs plus a third of an over) and its opponents having batted 185 legal deliveries (30.5 overs), then the team's Net Run Rate during that game is (6*((300/200)-(200/185)))= 2.51.

Magnon

A magnon in physics is a quasiparticle with magnetic properties. It is not a thing which exists on its own in free space but exists only within the structure being studied usually a crystalline solid.

Each atom in a solid has a magnetic field generated by its electrons as they spin. If these spins all align then the solid becomes magnetic at the bulk everyday level. Usually they do not align and the magnetic field of individual atoms cancel each other out. 

Individual atoms can have their spin reversed by interaction with energy from elsewhere. A spin reversal itself can influence the spin of the electrons in neighbouring atoms. A wave of change in electron spins can then move through the electrons in the crystal lattice as it dissipates like waves on a pool of water. Since the electrons are very small and governed by quantum mechanics, this wave, can be treated as though it is a number of particle like entities. These are magnetic quasi particles or magnons.

Peter continues to work with Stark as an intern for the Avengers, gaining the technology needed to improve his suit and equipment, but after getting in trouble with Mr. Stark, must fight the criminal known as "The Vulture" alone, regaining Stark's respect. 

As Spider-Man, Peter goes on to fight alongside Iron Man, Captain America, and other members of the Avengers when Thanos threatens their universe. The first time around, Thanos kills half of the universe's inhabitants, which unfortunately includes Peter. However, Peter and everyone else who was killed is brought back to life after Stark and the remaining Avengers figure out how to undo "the Snap". The Avengers defeat and kill Thanos the second time around, but Mr. Stark and some of the other Avengers die in the effort and cannot be brought back to life this time.

After Mr. Stark's death, Peter becomes very sad but vows to become stronger to honor him. He and Ned go on a class trip to London where he becomes close with another classmate, MJ, who becomes his girlfriend. Peter also encounters Quentin Beck, who initially seems like a good person and calls himself Mysterio, but is actually a scientist who used to work for Stark's company and was fired due to being crazy. After Peter is tricked into giving some technology to Mysterio, Ned and MJ give him clues on how to stop Mysterio. Peter has to rescue the two from Mysterio and defeats him, but Mysterio leaks Peter's identity as Spider-Man to the public and tricks "newscaster" J. Jonah Jameson into thinking that Peter/Spider-Man killed Mysterio and caused all the damage.Peter is later found not guilty, but his fame as Spider-Man negatively affects his life, as well as those of Ned, MJ, and Aunt May. He goes to Dr. Stephen Strange to try and make everyone forget he is Spider-Man, but due to trying to make some last-minute changes to have MJ, Ned, and Aunt May remember, the spell backfires and brings a few villains from other universes who know Peter is Spider-Man into this universe. Dr. Strange is mad and wants Peter, MJ, and Ned to find the villains, but after learning that the villains will most likely die fighting their versions of Spider-Man, Peter fights with Dr. Strange over this and wants to make the villains good again. He cures Doc Ock, but the Green Goblin, who has two personalities, has his bad personality come out and free the villains, also killing Aunt May. Peter's friends, as well as two other versions of himself from the other universes, "Peter Two" and "Peter Three", make him feel better and help him track down and cure all the bad guys. The only way everything can be fixed now is if Peter has everyone forget who he is, even his friends and family, but Peter says it's okay to Dr. Strange, saying goodbye to MJ and Ned but promising to find them. After the spell is fixed and sends everyone home, Peter goes on his own way as Spider-Man.

Tom Holland's portrayal of a teenaged Spider-Man in the films has been mixed, as they praised his suit and performance while others criticizied for being annoying and childish.

The first Liechtensteiner emigrants of which have record emigrated in United States in the early 1830s. However, first great wave of Liechtensteiner emigrants arrived to the United States on April 7, 1851, settling in New Orleans; and in 1852 other group emigrated to Dubuque, Iowa (including stonemasons, bricklayers and carpenters). Eventually, many of the Liechtensteiner emigrants of Dubuque left the city and got farms nearby. However, the Liechtensteiner emigration was reduced during the American Civil War (1861-1865). Later, when the construction of railroads began "lying the country together and opening up the West", other Liechtensteiners emigrated to United States to work in the construction of railroads.

During the following decades, many other Liechtensteiners emigrated to places such as Guttenberg, Iowa and Wabash, Indiana. However, between 1885 and 1907, Liechtensteiner emigration slowed, limited to a few individuals and families. Less than 30 Liechtensteiners emigrated during that period to United States. Reducing migration was due to the large increase in economic activity from the establishment of first textile factories in the 1880s.

The First World War caused an economic crisis in Liechtenstein (which originated, among other things, because the Entente allies stopped the "import of raw materials" into the country and the "massive speculation by the national bank"), so the Liechtenstein emigration to United States was retaken. Most of the new Liechtensteiner emigrants settled in urban areas, especially in Chicago and Hammond, Indiana, but there were Liechtensteiners throughout the country.

After the Second World War, a few more Liechtensteiners emigrated to the United States, the largest number arriving in 1948, when fifteen individuals or families came to this country. The reduction of the Liechtenstein emigration was due to improvements in economic conditions of Liechtenstein.

Cooper pair

A Cooper pair is a pair of free electrons within a solid that act together as one quasiparticle and in large numbers give rise to superconductivity.

Physicists explain superconductivity by describing what happens when temperatures get cold. The thermal energy in a solid or liquid shakes the atoms so they randomly vibrate, but this gets less as the temperature drops. Electrons carry the same negative electric charge which makes them repel each other. At higher temperatures each unbound electron behaves as if it were a free particle. There is also however a very weak attraction between electrons when they are in any solid or liquid. This is due to the way bound electrons distort the spacing of the atomic structure they find themselves in. At relatively rather large distances (many hundreds of nanometers apart) and low temperatures (near absolute zero), the attractive effect and lack of thermal energy allows pairs of electrons to hang together. This is called a cooper pair and it is a quasiparticle, that is it acts as if it were a new kind of particle in its own right even though it is made up of two fundamental electrons. 

Many overlapping cooper pairs can exist in the same nanometer sized space. Since paired electrons constitute a boson the motions of all of the cooper pairs within a single superconductor synchronise and they function as if they are a single entity. This is known as the Bose–Einstein condensation. The Cooper pairs form this condensate, which is superfluid or super-conducting. Small disturbances such as scattering of electrons are forbidden in this state as long as the temperature remains low. It moves as one showing no resistance to its motion. It is hence now a superconductor.

The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party ( ; PSOE ) is a social-democratic political party in Spain. The PSOE has been in government for a longer time than any other political party in modern democratic Spain.

The party was in charge of the Spanish government from 1982 to 1996 under Felipe González; from 2004 to 2011 under José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero; and currently since 2014 under Pedro Sánchez.

The PSOE was founded in 1879, making it the oldest party currently active in Spain. When it was founded, it was a marxist party, however they stopped supporting Marxism in 1979.

PSOE was founded in Madrid, and its main objective was the defense of worker's rights and the achievement of the ideals of marxist socialism, by gaining political power for the working class. 

From 1879 to 1910 PSOE was a little organisation, having only reprentation in 3 regions. At this time, anarchism was the dominant ideology in the spanish labour movement. In the "1910 Spanish general election", a seat was won by PSOE, and this gave the party more importance at national level.

In 1917, PSOE and UGT (the trade union of the party) participated in the "1917 Spanish general strike" and the party won more national attention. In 1920 a split from PSOE formed the "Communist Party of Spain". 

In the 1923–1930 dictatorship, some members of PSOE collaborated with the military regime, while others did not.

In the "1931 Spanish local elections" PSOE endorsed republican positions.
In 1931 the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed following the "1931 Spanish local elections" and the resignment of the spanish king Alfonso XIII. PSOE was the winner of the "1931 general election", the first free elections in Spain. 

The party had presence in the 1931-1933 goverment, and in the 1936-1939 goverment. In the "1936 Spanish general elections" PSOE was in the "Popular Front" coalition (a coalition of the main left wing spanish parties).

Following the Spanish Civil War, PSOE was prohibited and many memebers went to exile. PSOE was the second largest party in illegality during the Franco dictatorship.

In 1974, Felipe González won the leadership of the party, and announced the party will stop supporting marxism, which was made offcial in 1979.
The new ideology of the party was a Centre-left Social democracy.

PSOE endorsed the 1978 Spanish constitution. In the 1978 elections, PSOE was the second longest party, being UCD the 1st.

In the 1982 general elections, Felipe González won by absolute majority (more than 50%). PSOE will win all the elections from 1982 to 1996. In this era, Spain started to modernise in both social aspects and in economic ones.

In 1996 the PP won the presidency.

In the year 2000 José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero won the leadership of the party, and the 2004 and 2008 Spanish general elections. 

Under Zapatero´s rule, the PSOE started embracing progressivism and some social liberal economic policies. This changes were called "Nueva vía" and were very simmilar to the german Neue mitte and to the english New Labour.

Mantaining a simmilar philosophy to Zapatero, Pedro Sánchez was chosen general secretary in 2014.

In 2018, Pedro Sánchez (the opposition leader) was proclaimed president of spain, after Mariano Rajoy lost an impeachment. He won the two 2018 spanish elections, but lost the 2018 elections. However PSOE would join with all the opposition and regional parties to mantain the spanish presidency.

Happiness pump

A happiness pump is an idea in philosophy. A happiness pump is someone who will do anything to make other people happy even if it makes them very unhappy themselves. They have turned themselves into a machine (a "pump") that makes happiness.

The happiness pump is a way of showing problems in utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is a moral philosophy. It is a way of deciding which actions are good and which are bad. In utilitarianism, actions that make more happiness or stop pain are good. Actions that stop happiness or make pain are bad. In utilitarianism, it does not matter who is becoming happier or feeling less pain. That means that, in utilitarianism, helping strangers is good. The happiness pump is a person who has taken utilitarianism too far and will give themselves lots of pain so long as they believe it makes other people somewhere in the world much happier.

The happiness pump is only an idea. Philosopher Joshua David Greene says it is almost impossible to be a happiness pump for real. People who even tried would give up.

A happiness pump character is on one episode of the television show "The Good Place".

John André

Major John André (b. 1750 - d. 1780) was a British officer in the American War for Independence. He helped Benedict Arnold change sides to the British army and tried to take the fort West Point for the British. He was killed for the crime of being a spy.

André was born in 1750 in London.

His parents were Huguenots. The Huguenots were Protestants who had lived in France. When the French government said it was illegal to be Protestants, many Huguenots went to other countries. André's mother went to England when she was young. His mother had been born in France and his father had been born in Geneva. André's father was a merchant—he earned money by buying and selling things. André's parents had one other son and three daughters.

André went to school in Geneva and then came back to England in 1767. He had a good education. He could draw, paint, play the flute, write poems, and speak English, French, German, and Italian.

André wanted to join the army, but at that time, people did not become officers unless they could buy the job. When André's father died in 1769, André had to make money to take care of his family. He became a merchant in his father's business.

André fell in love with an English woman named Honora Sneyd. But Sneyd's guardians would not let them marry unless André became rich. André worked hard to be a good merchant. But then Honora Sneyd changed her mind. Then André joined the army. Sneyd's foster sister, Anna Seward, said André joined the army because he had a broken heart.

André joined the army on March 4, 1771. He did special training in Germany for two years. In 1774, he went to Canada with the Royal Welsh Fusileers. He was a lieutenant at the time. André helped defend St. John's from the American army. The siege lasted two months, and the British lost.

André was captured at St. John's. Because he was an officer and not an enlisted man, he was held prisoner in inns instead of barracks and ate dinner with rich people. André was kept prisoner in the house of the Cope family in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Many people in Lancaster County spoke German, and so could André, so he made friends. André also taught art to the Copes' son.

In 1776, André was sent back to the British army. He was traded for American prisoners. He wrote a book about everything he had learned about the British Colonies and drew maps of places he had been. He gave the book to British General William Howe in New York City. Howe thought the book was very good and that André was very intelligent. He promoted André to captain and made him aide to Major-General Charles Grey.

André was part of the invasion of Philadelphia in 1777. At the time, Philadelphia was the largest city in the thirteen colonies. The British captured it. André fought in the Battle of Brandywine, the Paoli Massacre, the Battle of Germantown, the Battle of Monmouth, and Grey's raids into Massachusetts and New Jersey in 1778. André kept a personal book during this time. That book is now a valuable historical source about the war.

During the winter of 1777-1778, there was less fighting because it was too cold and snowy. John André lived in Philadelphia in Benjamin Franklin's house. He wrote poetry for women, for example Peggy Shippen. He also threw a large party called the Mischianza to honor General Howe and his brother, Admiral Richard Howe. When the British left Philadelphia, André packed up and stole many of Benjamin Franklin's inventions, books, and other things. Historians think General Grey may have ordered him to do this.

In 1778, André was promoted to major and deputy Adjutant General.

In May of 1779, Benedict Arnold, a high-ranking American officer, told André he wanted to change sides if the British would give him £10,000 and high rank in the British military. He was the commander of the fort West Point. If the British had West Point, they could control the Hudson Valley and they would be much stronger in New England. André and Arnold sent letters to each other for months.

In 1779, André went with General Clinton to attack Charleston, South Carolina, and they won. André returned north with Clinton and began talking to Arnold again. Arnold said he had to meet André in person to plan the surrender of West Point.

In September 1779, André got on a ship and sailed up the Hudson. He met Arnold, who gave him papers and the plans to West Point. But André could not get back to his ship because American forces had attacked it, and it had sailed away. André decided to go back to British territory in disguise. He took off his British army uniform and put on ordinary clothes. On the way, he was captured by American freelance soldiers. They found the papers Arnold had given André. They arrested André as a spy.

Because André had been in disguise and not wearing his uniform, he was legally a spy and not only an enemy soldier. The punishment for being a spy was much worse. André was put on trial in Tappan, New York. Many of his friends wrote letters to George Washington to ask that he be allowed to live. Others asked that he be allowed to die by firing squad, which was the usual way soldiers were killed. On September 29, 1780, André was found guilty of being "under a feigned name and in a disguised habit." He was sentenced to die by hanging. André was hanged at noon on October 2, 1780.

At first, André was buried next to the Hudson River. A peach tree grew on top of his grave. In 1782, King George III had a monument built for André in Westminster Abbey.

In 1821, people dug up John André's bones and took them to England. He is buried in Westminster Abbey. They took the peach tree too and replanted it in the king's garden. There is another monument in Tappan, New York.

A fictional John André is in the television series "Turn".

2021 Atlantic hurricane season

The 2021 Atlantic hurricane season was the third most active Atlantic hurricane season. It officially began on June 1, 2021, and ended on November 30, 2021. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most Atlantic tropical cyclones form. However, tropical cyclogenesis is possible at any time of the year, as demonstrated by the early formation of Subtropical Storm Ana on May 22, making 2021 the seventh consecutive year that a storm formed before the official start of the season. In June 3 named storms formed during the month making June 2021 the most active June since 1968 and also tied with 1886, 1909, and 1936.

Starting this season, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to issue regular Tropical Weather Outlooks on May 15, two weeks earlier than it did in the past. This change was implemented in light of the fact that named systems had formed in the Atlantic Ocean prior to the official start of the season in each of the preceding six seasons.

Tropical Storm Ana was the first tropical cyclone of the year. This storm threatened Bermuda, warranting a Tropical Storm Watch, but it did not affect that area. It moved northeast and dissipated on May 24. This storm formed before hurricane season officially begun, continuing the 7-year streak of pre-season systems.
Tropical Storm Bill threatened the East Coast of the United States as it formed into Tropical Depression Two, but it did not affect that region and continued northeast into the Atlantic Ocean, south of Canada, and dissipated on June 16.
Tropical Storm Claudette formed just off the coast of Louisiana and made landfall in eastern Terrebonne Parish, and weakened to a tropical depression travelled across Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas, and southern Virginia before moving into the Atlantic, reintensifying into a tropical storm on June 21 and turning post-tropical the next day. The storm later dissipated the next day. This storm killed 14 people in Alabama, 4 of which were direct.
Tropical Storm Danny formed off the coast of South Carolina and made landfall in that state. This made Danny the first June storm to make landfall in South Carolina since Hurricane One in 1867. It dissipated inland the next day. 

Tropical Storm Elsa formed on the early morning hours of July 1, 2021, and intensified into a tropical storm later that day. This made it the earliest fifth tropical cyclone to form in the Atlantic since reliable records begun in 1851. This is also the second earliest storm to form this far east in the Main Development Region, only behind the 1933 Trinidad hurricane. This storm rapidly moved towards the Lesser Antillies at 30 mph after it became a tropical storm.

Hurricane Ida was a powerful Category 4 hurricane that affected Gulf Coast of the United States, Southeastern United States, and Northeastern United States in late August 2021 into early September 2021. Ida was the ninth named storm, and fourth hurricane of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, Ida originated from a tropical wave first monitored by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) on August 23, moving into the Caribbean Sea and developing into a tropical storm on August 26. On August 27, Ida became a Category 1 hurricane and initiated rapid intensification on the next day, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC on August 28.

These names will be used for named storms that form in the North Atlantic in 2021. Retired names, if any, will be announced by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 2022. The names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2027 season. This is the same list used in the 2015 season, with the exceptions of "Elsa" and "Julian", which replaced "Erika" and "Joaquin". The names "Elsa", "Julian", "Rose", "Sam", "Teresa", "Victor", and "Wanda" was used for the first time this year.
This is a table of all of the storms that have formed in the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s)–denoted by bold location names – damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 2021 USD.

Dobsonian telescope

A Dobsonian telescope is an Newtonian telescope design.

It is "altazimuth-mounted". An altazimuth or alt-azimuth mount is a simple two-axis mount. It supports and rotates an instrument about two perpendicular axes – one vertical and the other horizontal. 

Rotation about the vertical axis varies the compass bearing of where the instrument points (the azimuth). Rotation about the horizontal axis varies the altitude (angle of elevation) of the pointing direction.

It was popularised by John Dobson in 1965. It increased the size of telescopes for amateur astronomers. Dobson's telescopes had a simplified mechanical design that was easy to make from readily available components. It made a large, portable, low-cost telescope. 

The design works for looking at faint, deep-sky objects such as nebulae and galaxies. This type of observation needs a large objective diameter (i.e. light-gathering power) of relatively short focal length. It can be taken to less light-polluted places.

National Democratic Alliance

The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is an Indian political alliance. It made up of center-right and right-wing political parties and led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). It was founded in 1998. It currently controls the Indian union government as well as the government of 18 Indian states.

Its first chairman was Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. L. K. Advani, the former Deputy Prime Minister, took over as chairman in 2004 and served until 2014. After that, Amit Shah has been the chairman since 2014. The coalition ruled from 1998 to 2004. The alliance returned to power in the 2014 general elections with a combined vote share of 38.5%. Its leader, Narendra Modi, was sworn in as Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014. In the 2019 general election, the alliance further increased its tally to 353 seats with combined vote share of 45.43%.

The NDA was formed in May 1998 as a coalition to contest the general elections. The main aim of the NDA was to form a anti-Congress coalition. It was led by the BJP, and included several regional parties, including the Samta Party and the AIADMK, as well as Shiv Sena, the only member which shared the Hindutva ideology of the BJP. After the election, it was able to muster a slim majority with outside support from the Telugu Desam Party, allowing Atal Bihari Vajpayee to return as prime minister.

The government collapsed within a year because the AIADMK withdrew its support. After the entry of a few more regional parties, the NDA proceeded to win the 1999 elections with a larger majority. Vajpayee became Prime Minister for a third time, and this time served a full five-year term.

The NDA called elections in early 2004, six months ahead of schedule. Its campaign was based around the slogan of "India Shining" which attempted to depict the NDA government. It responsible for a rapid economic transformation of the country. However, the NDA suffered a defeat. They won with only a 186 seats in the Lok Sabha, compared to the 222 of the United Progressive Alliance led by the Congress, with Manmohan Singh. Singh has succeeded Vajpayee as prime minister. Commentators have argued that the NDA's defeat was due to a failure to reach out to the rural masses.

The National Democratic Alliance does not have a formal governing structure such as an executive board or politburo. It has been up to the leaders of the individual parties to make decisions on issues such as sharing of seats in elections, allocation of ministries and the issues that are raised in Parliament. Given the varied ideologies among the parties, there have been many cases of disagreement and split voting among the allies.

Owing to ill health, George Fernandes, who was the NDA convener until 2008, was discharged of his responsibility. He replaced by Sharad Yadav, the then national president of the JD(U) party. On 16 June 2013, the JD(U) left the coalition and Sharad Yadav resigned from the role of the NDA convener. Then the CM of Andhra Pradesh Chandrababu Naidu was made the NDA convener.

On 27 July 2017 JD(U) with the help of BJP formed the government in Bihar. Later, on 19 August 2017 JD(U) formally rejoined the NDA after 4 years.

As of December 2023, the BJP holds a majority of Legislative Assembly in 10 states - Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Goa, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Rajasthan, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. In Haryana, BJP shares power as the senior partner (Chief Minister of BJP) with Jannayak Janta Party.

Younger Dryas

The Younger Dryas (around 12,900 to 11,700 years ago) was a cold period. It reversed the gradual climatic warming which started around 20,000 years ago. 

At this time there was a sharp fall in temperature over most of the Northern Hemisphere. This occurred at the end of the Pleistocene epoch and just before the present, warmer, Holocene epoch. 

The last glacial maximum (LGM) was about 27,000 to 24,000 years ago. The Younger Dryas was the most recent and longest of several interruptions to the gradual warming of the Earth's climate. The change was relatively sudden, and it resulted in a decline of temperatures in Greenland by 4 to 10 °C (7.2 to 18 °F) Glaciers and dry conditions spread over much of the temperate Northern Hemisphere. It may have been caused by an influx of fresh, cold water from North America to the Atlantic.

The Younger Dryas was a period of climatic change. The effects were complex and variable. In the Southern Hemisphere and some areas of the Northern Hemisphere, such as southeastern North America, a slight warming occurred.

Headington Shark

The Headington Shark is a sculpture on the top of a house. It is at 2 New High Street, Headington, Oxford. The sculpture is a shark breaking the roof of the house. Its proper name is Untitled 1986.

The shark was first put on the house on 9 August 1986. The house is owned by a radio presenter, Bill Heine. The sculpture is 4 long hundredweight and 25 feet long. It is made of painted fibreglass. It took 3 months to make the shark.

The statue was put together on the 41st anniversary of the bombing of Nagasaki. It was designed by John Buckley. Anton Castiau made the sculpture. Heine said that the shark is "saying something about CND, nuclear power, Chernobyl and Nagasaki".

On August 2007, the shark was renovated by Buckley. This was because of complaints of the quality of the sculpture.

On 26 August 2016, Heine's son Magnus Hanson-Heine bought the house. He bought it so that the shark can stay on top of the house.

The shark started controversy when it was first put on the house. Oxford City Council wanted the shark removed from the house because it was not safe for the people living near. There were no planning permissions for the shark. In 1992, Minister Tony Baldry from the Department of the Environment said that the shark can stay on the house because it does not cause any problems.

Bush article says that he continues a family tradition of corruption, deceit and intrigue.

Reactionary

A reactionary or reactionist is a person or organization that is against social progress and wants society to return to the old way of doing things.

The word reactionary comes from the word "reaction," which describes movement in the opposite direction. In this case, reactionary beliefs and actions are opposed to the direction of social progress.

Some parts of right-wing politics is based on reactionary thinking and a wish to return to the way things were. 

The words counter-revolutionary or anti-revolutionary are sometimes used instead of the word reactionary.

The word reactionary was first used during the French Revolution. The "réactionnaires" were people who wanted France to return to a monarchy.

In the 20th century, socialists and communists used the word reactionary to describe their enemies. In Marxist thinking, a reactionary is someone who supports causes like feudalism, capitalism, fascism, nationalism, or any other cause opposed to social reform and revolution.

Reactionary politics is still influential in politics. There are many people and political parties who have opinions that can be seen as reactionary because they want to go back to the old ways. For example, Donald Trump can be considered a reactionary politician.

Leg before wicket

Leg before wicket (LBW) is one way a batsman can get out in cricket. There must be an appeal to the umpire at the bowler's end, and he makes the decision.

LBW happens when the ball touches a batsman's body before it touches the bat or a hand/glove holding the bat, and the ball would otherwise have hit the wicket. 

Leg before wicket first appeared in the laws of cricket in 1774, as batsmen began to use their pads to prevent the ball hitting their wicket.

The definition of leg before wicket (lbw) is currently Law 36 in the Laws of Cricket, written by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). 

Before a batter can be dismissed lbw, the fielding team must appeal to the umpire. If the bowler delivers a no-ball — an illegal delivery — the batter cannot be out lbw under any circumstances. 

Otherwise, for the batter to be adjudged lbw, the ball, if it bounces, must hit the pitch in line with or on the off side of the wickets. For a right-handed batsman, the off side is the right-hand side of the pitch when viewed from his perspective. For a left-handed batsman, the off side is the left-hand side. Then the ball must strike part of the batsman's body without first touching his/her bat, In the Laws of Cricket, the batsman's bat is considered to include the hand or hands holding it. in line with the wickets and have been going on to hit the stumps. 

The batter may also be out lbw if, having made no attempt to hit the ball with their bat, they are struck outside the line of off stump by a ball that would have hit the wickets. The umpire must assume that the ball would have continued on the same trajectory after striking the batter, even if it would have bounced before hitting the stumps.

Sometimes video replay and other technologies are used to decide if a batter is out LBW. For example, heat-tracking ("Hot Spot") can visually show when the ball has hit the bat or part of the batter's body, audio-tracking ("Snickometer") can show if there is a slight sound from the impact of the ball, and advanced simulations ("Hawkeye") can predict where the ball would have gone after impact with the batter's body if the batter had not been there.

Battle of Monmouth

The Battle of Monmouth or Battle of Monmouth Courthouse was a battle of the American Revolutionary War. It was fought on June 28, 1778 in Monmouth, New Jersey. The British army retreated, but neither side won. Monmouth was the longest battle between the main Continental Army and the main British Army.

Four days earlier, the leaders of the Continental Army (the Americans) met. Some wanted to fight the British army head-on and some did not. Most of the leaders decided to fight small battles and win slowly.

General George Washington and General Charles Lee led the Continental Army to Englishtown. There, Washington ordered the army to attack British General Sir Henry Clinton's army. During the battle, Lee ordered his own Continental troops to retreat. Washington became angry and ordered Lee and "Mad" Anthony Wayne to slow the British down while he, Washington, took command. The Continental Army defended its position while the British attacked all day. That night, the British left in the dark.

There were about 10,000 Continental troops and about 11,000 British troops. About 100 British troops were killed or injured and about 150 Continentals. About 100 people fell or died from heatstroke. George Washington's horse also died of heatstroke.

June 28 was a very hot day. Mary Ludwig Hayes brought water to her husband and other gunners during the battle many times. One time, she brought water and found her husband had been shot and injured. She took over his job as gunner. People gave her the nickname "Molly Pitcher." There may have been more than one real-life woman who was given the name "Molly Pitcher."

Nathanael Greene and the Marquis de Lafayette also fought in this battle.

Both armies had muskets. The Highland Scots in the British army also had broadswords. The British and the German soldiers had bayonets, long blades attached to the ends of the muskets. The Continental army had been trying to get bayonets. Some of the Virginia troops had rifled firearms.

This was the first time the Continental army used the tactics and training they had learned at Valley Forge from then-Acting Inspector General Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben.

General Lee asked to be court-martialed for his actions in this battle. He was sentenced to one year suspension.

After the Battle of Monmouth, the war moved to the South.

Reenactors reenact the battle at Monmouth Battlefield State Park in Freehold, New Jersey.

Besides A. afzelii, the genus has the following species: "A. barteri, A. gigantea, A. gilletii, A. gracilis, A. hastifolia, A. heterophylla", and "A. pynaertii".

Edward Craven Walker

Edward Craven Walker (4 July 1918 – 15 August 2000) was a British inventor, who invented the lava lamp. He is also known for being a naturist.

Walker got the idea of a lava lamp from seeing what is now called a "blob light", a mix of oil and water heated by a lightbulb at the bottom. He thought it would look more interesting if the oil was thick enough to form shapes, and spent 10 years trying to make it good.

Eventually, his product was launched in 1963, and Walker's factory soon began production of it as it grew in popularity.

Apparently, Walker once said, "If you buy my lamp, you won't need drugs."

Lava lamps were featured in the sitcom series "Absolutely Fabulous", which some people think helped the lava lamp's popularity, which was declining at the time.

Eventually, as it become less popular in the 1980s, Walker sold the company to Elizabeth Granger. Her company, Mathmos, was one of Britain's fastest growing companies, mostly from the lava lamp. Walker believed the lava lamp would be good for her company.

"I think it will always be popular." he once said. "It's like the cycle of life. It grows, breaks up, falls down, and starts all over again." 

Walker's interest in nudity began with a visit to the Isle du Levant in the 1950s. He liked the idea, and tried to make it popular. "Eves on Skies" was broadcast in 1958, and "Travelling Light" followed soon after in 1960.

The success of Travelling Light gave Walker the money to buy a nightclub in Bournemouth. He turned it into a nudist resort. He tried to ban overweight nudists from entering, but failed.

"We are all against these fat fogies, it's not what naturism is about," he said

Walker was suffering from cancer in the mid and late 1990s, and he eventually died because of it. He died in Ringwood, Hampshire at the age of 82 on the 15th of August 2000.

Browser engine

For computers, a browser engine (also called a layout or rendering engine) is a main part of a web browser that is responsible for showing a web page. It is separate from other parts, such as a JavaScript engine.

In order to render, or make visible, a web page, it takes a Hyper Text Markup Language document and splits it up into elements. These elements, such as text, links, and images, are placed onto the Document Object Model (DOM), a way of finding the structure of the page. It then takes the Cascading Style Sheets code to tell it where to place the elements from the DOM, as well as other things, such as colors or backgrounds to put around the elements.

Some engines that are used include:


Electronic tagging

There are special electronic devices, that can be permanently attached to a person. These devices are called electronic tags.

There are two basic use cases:

Especially in the case of monitoring old people, there have been concerns about privacy.

In the case of monitoring a criminal or someone on probation, the person has to report to a base station at given times. When the base station no longer detects the signal from the tag, it will alert the authorities.

In espionage jargon a mole ("deep cover agent", or "sleeper") is a long-term spy. 

The spy is recruited "before" having access to secret intelligence. Later, if he gets into the target organization, he or she becomes active.

George Smiley

George Smiley OBE is a fictional character created by John le Carré. Smiley is an intelligence officer with "The Circus". This is the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), commonly known as MI6. 

He is a central character in the novels "Call for the Dead", "A Murder of Quality", "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy", "The Honourable Schoolboy", and "Smiley's People", and a supporting character in "The Spy Who Came In from the Cold", "The Looking Glass War", "The Secret Pilgrim" and "A Legacy of Spies". The character has also appeared in a number of film, television, and radio adaptations of le Carré's books.

Le Carré, who created Smiley, wanted to show that Ian Fleming's James Bond series was an inaccurate picture of espionage life. Smiley is polite, shy and humble. He often allows others to mistreat him, especially his unfaithful wife. But his humility masks his inner cunning, excellent memory, mastery of tradecraft, and occasional ruthlessness. His genius being underestimated helps Smiley achieve his goals. In the end, he becomes one of the most powerful agents in Britain.

The character is held in high esteem in Britain, where he has become a pop-culture icon on par with Bond. "The Guardian" called him "the sort of spy [Britain] believes it ought to have: a bit shabby, academic, basically loyal, and sceptical of... his political masters".

Angelica Schuyler Church

Angelica Schuyler Church was an American woman from New York. She knew Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, the Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson.

Angelica was born in 1756. She grew up in Albany, New York. Her parents were Philip Schuyler and Catharine Van Rensselaer Schuyler. Philip Schuyler had fought in the French and Indian War. He went to the New York State Assembly and Continental Congress. During the Revolutionary War, Philip Schuyler was a Major General in the Continental Army. Her parents had fifteen children, and eight lived to be adults. Angelica's sister Elizabeth would later marry Alexander Hamilton. The Schuyler family had almost twenty slaves.

Historian Danielle Funiciello of the Schuyler Museum says the Schuyler daughters probably learned French, dancing, geography, history, writing, arithmetic, music, needlework, and how to run a household. Because about half of Albany spoke Dutch as a first language, the Schuylers probably spoke Dutch. Because Angelica could read in French, she could read philosophy.

After the war, Philip Schuyler was a senator in the New York state government and then senator for New York in the United States government.

Angelica Schuyler married a British man called John Barker Church in 1777. At the time, John Barker Church was using a false name, John Carter. He had changed his name and left England because he owed people money from gambling. She ran away to marry him because she thought her parents would not want them to marry. Her parents were angry and would not speak to her for days. Her mother's parents talked to her parents until they changed their minds.

John Barker Church made a lot of money selling supplies to the French and Continental armies during the war. He was General George Washington's Commissary General. He also made money buying land and selling it later.

In 1783, Angelica Schuyler Church, her husband, and their four children moved from the United States to France. John Barker Church was an envoy from the United States government to the government of France. In Paris, Angelica Schuyler Church made friends with Benjamin Franklin, the Marquis de Lafayette, the Marquis de Tallyrand and Thomas Jefferson. She introduced Thomas Jefferson to Maria Cosway.

In 1785, the Churches moved to London, where Angelica Schuyler Church made friends with some people in the royal family. John Barker Church became a member of Parliament. They visited the United States twice. They visited once in 1785. They visited again in 1789 because Angelica Schuyler Church had been invited to George Washington's inauguration, the ceremony where he officially became the first President of the United States.

The Churches moved back to the United States in 1797.

John Barker Church had given supplies to the Americans during the Revolutionary War. At the time, he told them they could pay him later. Because the American government realized they could not pay him at all, they gave him land in New York State instead. They gave him 100,000 acres on the Genesee River. Angelica and John's son Philip Church designed and built a town there, Angelica, New York, named after his mother.

Angelica Schuyler Church died on March 13, 1814.

Angelica is a character in the Broadway musical "Hamilton" by Lin-Manuel Miranda. Miranda said he had to make changes so the story of the musical would make sense. For example, in the musical, Angelica gets married after Elizabeth and Alexander Hamilton do, instead of before.

Names of Vietnam

Throughout history of Vietnam, besides official names, there are names that are used unofficially to refer to the territory of Vietnam. Vietnam was ever called Văn Lang during the Hùng Vương Dynasty, Âu Lạc when An Dương was king, Nam Việt during the Triệu Dynasty, Van Xuan during the Anterior Lý Dynasty, Đại Cồ Việt during the Đinh dynasty and Early Lê dynasty. Starting in 1054, Vietnam was called Đại Việt (Great Viet). During the Hồ dynasty, Vietnam was called Đại Ngu.

Việt Nam ( in Vietnamese) is a variation of Nam Việt (Southern Việt), a name that can be traced back to the Triệu dynasty (2nd century BC, also known as Nanyue Kingdom). The word "Việt" originated as a shortened form of Bách Việt, a word used to refer to a people who lived in what is now southern China in ancient times. The word "Việt Nam", with the syllables in the modern order, first appears in the 16th century in a poem by Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm. "Annam", which originated as a Chinese name in the seventh century, was the common name of the country during the colonial period. Nationalist writer Phan Bội Châu revived the name "Vietnam" in the early 20th century. When rival communist and anti-communist governments were set up in 1945, both immediately adopted this as the country's official name. In English, the two syllables are usually combined into one word, "Vietnam". However, "Viet Nam" was once common usage and is still used by the United Nations and by the Vietnamese government.

The term "" (Yue) (), Early Middle Chinese was first written using the logograph "戉" for an axe (a homophone), in oracle bone and bronze inscriptions of the late Shang dynasty ( BC), and later as "越". At that time it referred to a people or chieftain to the northwest of the Shang. In the early 8th century BC, a tribe on the middle Yangtze were called the Yangyue, a term later used for peoples further south. Between the 7th and 4th centuries BC Yue/Việt referred to the State of Yue in the lower Yangtze basin and its people.

From the 3rd century BC the term was used for the non-Chinese populations of south and southwest China and northern Vietnam, with particular states or groups called Minyue, Ouyue, Luoyue (Vietnamese: Lạc Việt), etc., collectively called the Baiyue (Bách Việt). The term Baiyue/Bách Việt first appeared in the book "Lüshi Chunqiu" compiled around 239 BC.

In 207 BC, former Qin dynasty general Zhao Tuo/Triệu Đà founded the kingdom Nanyue/Nam Việt with its capital at Panyu (modern Guangzhou). This kingdom was "southern" because it was south of other Baiyue kingdoms such as Minyue and Ouyue, in modern Fujian and Zhejiang. Several later Vietnamese dynasties followed this nomenclature even after these more northern peoples were absorbed into China.

In "Sấm Trạng Trình" (The Prophecies of Trạng Trình), poet Nguyen Binh Khiêm (1491–1585) reversed the traditional order of the syllables and put the name in its modern form: "Vietnam is being created" (). At this time, the country was divided between the Trịnh lords of Hanoi and the Nguyễn lords of Huế. By combining several existing names, Nam Việt, Annam (Pacified South), Đại Việt (Great Việt), and "Nam quốc" (southern nation), Khiêm could create a new name that referred to an aspirational unified state. The word "nam" no longer implies Southern Việt, but rather that Vietnam is "the South" in contrast to China, "the North". This explanation is implied by Lý Thường Kiệt in the poem "Nam quốc sơn hà" (1077): "Over the mountains and rivers of the South, reigns the emperor of the South." Researcher Nguyễn Phúc Giác Hải found the word 越南 "Việt Nam" on 12 steles carved in the 16th and 17th centuries, including one at Bảo Lâm Pagoda, Haiphong (1558). Nguyễn Phúc Chu (1675–1725) used the word in a poem: "This is the most dangerous mountain in Vietnam" (). It was used as an official name by Emperor Gia Long in 1804-1813. The Jiaqing Emperor refused Gia Long's request to change his country's name to Nam Việt, and changed the name instead to Việt Nam. Gia Long's Đại Nam thực lục contains the diplomatic correspondence over the naming.

The use of "Vietnam" was revived in modern times by nationalists including Phan Bội Châu, whose book "Việt Nam vong quốc sử" (History of the Loss of Vietnam) was published in 1906. Chau also founded the Việt Nam Quang Phục Hội (Vietnam Restoration League) in 1912. However, the general public continued to use Annam and the name "Vietnam" remained virtually unknown until the Yên Bái mutiny of 1930, organized by the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng (Vietnamese Nationalist Party). By the early 1940s, the use of "Việt Nam" was widespread. It appeared in the name of Ho Chi Minh's Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi (Viet Minh), founded 1941, and was even used by the governor of French Indochina in 1942. The name "Vietnam" has been official since 1945. It was adopted in June by Bảo Đại's imperial government in Huế, and in September by Ho's rival communist government in Hanoi.



In English, the spellings Vietnam, Viet-Nam, and Viet Nam have all been used. The 1954 edition of "Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary" gave both the unspaced and hyphenated forms; in response to a letter from a reader, the editors indicated that the spaced form Viet Nam was also acceptable, though they stated that because Anglophones did not know the meaning of the two words making up the name Vietnam, "it is not surprising" that there was a tendency to drop the space. In 1966, the U.S. government was known to use all three renderings, with the State Department preferring the hyphenated version. By 1981, the hyphenated form was regarded as "dated", according to Scottish writer Gilbert Adair, and he titled his book about depictions of the country in film using the unhyphenated and unspaced form "Vietnam".

The modern Chinese name for Vietnam () can be translated as "Beyond the South", leading to the folk etymology that the name is a reference to the country's location beyond the southernmost borders of China. Another theory explains that the nation was termed as such in order to emphasize the division of those who stayed in China in contrast to the people living in Vietnam.

Both Japanese and Korean formerly referred to Vietnam by their respective Sino-Xenic pronunciations of the Chinese characters for its names, but later switched to using direct phonetic transcriptions.

Desmond Morris, who studied his behaviour, gave him materials to paint, but didn't show him how to do it. During his life, Congo made over 400 paintings. People living at the time of Congo thought his paintings resembled abstract art. Nadezhda Ladygina-Kohts had done similar experiments with chimpanzees in Moscow. In 1913, Khots found that the drawings resembled those of her two year old son. At the time when they were done, people did not think highly of them. Despite this, artists such as Herbert Read, Julian Huxley and Pablo Picasso bought some of Congo's paintings. In 2005, three of Congo's paintings were sold at an auction for more than 14,000 pound sterling.

Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben

Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben (September 17, 1730 – November 28, 1794) was a German fighter who helped the Continental Army in the Revolutionary War. At Valley Forge, he taught the Continental Army how to fight the European way.

Steuben was born September 17, 1730 in Magdeburg. At the time, Magdeburg was in the Kingdom of Prussia.

Steuben's father worked with engineers in the 1744 Siege of Prague.

Steuben joined the Prussian army when he was 16. He learned that the Prussian army was a good army because it was very disciplined. He became a lieutenant. He fought in the Seven Years War. He became a captain. He worked for General Johann von Mayer. In 1762, he was aide-de-camp to Frederick the Great. Steuben was in the army 17 years.

In 1763, Steuben was pushed out of the army because there was peace and the government wanted the army to be smaller.

Steuben went to work for the court of a small German country called Hohenzollern-Hechingen. In 1769, the prince of Baden added Steuben to the chivalric Order of Fidelity. That meant Steuben was allowed to use the title "Freiherr", meaning "free lord," or "baron."

In 1777, Hohenzollern-Hechingen lost its money, and von Steuben needed a new job. He looked for army jobs in Europe, but Europe was mostly at peace. He looked for a job with the Prince of Baden, but someone told stories that von Steuben had "taken liberties with young boys," meaning someone called him a pedophile.

The Revolutionary War had started in North America. Von Steuben looked for a job with the Continental Army. He went to France and met Benjamin Franklin and Silas Deane. Franklin and Deane wanted von Steuben to help the Continental Army, so they wrote to the Continental Congress. They lied and said he had been a general in the Prussian army (he had really only been a captain). They told other lies too. They did this because many, many Europeans from rich or noble families wanted to fight in the Continental Army. Many of them expected to be generals, but the Continental Army was not large enough for so many generals. Also, many of them had not fought in wars before, and the Continental Congress sent them home. Franklin and Deane knew that only a very, very good story would make Congress hire von Steuben.

Von Steuben came to America in 1777. He told Congress he did not mind if he was not a general. He told the Continental Congress that they only had to pay him if they won the war. They hired him.

Von Steuben went to Valley Forge and met General George Washington. Washington made von Steuben Acting Inspector General and told him to teach the Continental Army soldiers how to fight the European way.

Von Steuben taught the soldiers how to drill, meaning he made them practice marching, shooting, and fighting together until they were good fighters. He made all the officers use the same drills so the soldiers would not be confused in a real battle. He also told Washington and Congress which weapons and supplies they should buy, for example bayonets.

Von Steuben did not speak English well. Instead, he cursed at the soldiers in French and German. The Continental soldiers liked him anyway.

One problem with the Continental Army was that the officers who did drill their men sometimes used different drills. This made the soldiers confused in real battles. Von Steuben, the Marquis de Lafayette, and Alexander Hamilton wrote one drill book for the whole Continental Army, the Blue Book. The American military used it until after the War of 1812.

Von Steuben wrote to a friend, "The genius of this nation is not in the least to be compared with that of the Prussian, Austrians, or French. You say to your soldier 'Do this and he doeth it'; but I am obliged to say [to the American soldier]: 'This is the reason why you ought to do that: and then he does it.'"

After the Battle of Monmouth, Congress gave von Steuben the rank Major General. He led soldiers at the Battle of Yorktown and other battles.

Von Steuben died in November 28, 1794 at his home in New York State.

Von Steuben was accused of being a pedophile, but it was never proven.

Historians today believe von Steuben was homosexual, meaning he had relationships with other adult men. It was an open secret, meaning that Washington and other people knew von Steuben was homosexual and decided not to talk about it.

Classical architecture

Classical architecture is any architecture that has features from the ancient Greek and Roman style of building. It is also known as the architecture of classical antiquity. Many features of classical architecture come from the writing of the Roman architect Vitruvius.

Different styles of classical architecture might have existed since the Carolingian Renaissance. Styles have definitely existed since the Italian Renaissance. 

Aquaducts were used to transport water to different places in the roman empire it was a roman style of architecture. 

Classical architecture buildings can be very different, but all classical architecture uses the same common design features. These features are structural and visual. 

In much of Europe and America, from the Renaissance until World War Two, classical architecture was very popular and important to architecture. It is still important today, but less than it has been in history. 

The term classical architecture is also used to talk about any type of architecture that has become a very specific style. For example, classical Chinese architecture, or classical Mayan architecture. The words "traditional" and "vernacular" can mean something different to "classical", or something similar. 

The phrases New Classical and Neoclassical describe classical architecture that was built in modern times.

Classical architecture comes from the architecture of ancient Greece and ancient Rome. After the west part of the Roman empire stopped existing, no Roman architecture was built in most of western Europe. 

In the Carolingian Renaissance, which happened in the 8th and 9th centuries, people started bringing back classical architecture. For example, the gatehouse of Lorsch Abbey (c.800 AD) in Germany looks like the Colosseum in Rome. The Colosseum is a very important piece of classical architecture. 

Many styles of architecture have features of classical architecture. For example, Byzantine, Romanesque, and Gothic architecture. But these styles do not try to exactly copy the traditions of classical architecture. For example, the idea of putting specific spaces between columns. So these styles are not thought of as classical architecture.

By the time the Italian Renaissance started, Gothic architecture was not used much anymore. Architects such as Leon Battista Alberti, Sebastiano Serlio, and Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola started trying to bring back the style of architecture used in ancient Rome.

They did this by reading a paper called "De architectura", which was written by Vitruvius. Vitruvius was an architect in ancient Rome, and his paper has a lot of information about classical architecture and its features. The architects also looked at the old buildings in Rome and Italy. 

The classical architecture from the Renaissance shows that classical ideas were used in a very specific way. Some of the ideas they used had no clear origin in ancient architecture. For example, the Ospedale degli Innocenti building in Florence was built by Filippo Bruncelleschi, and is one of the earliest Renaissance buildings. It was finished in 1445. But the columns on the building do not look exactly like the columns in Roman architecture. 

During the Renaissance, people learned about how ancient buildings were designed (the theory of classical architecture). They did not look at how every building was designed. This means classical architecture is not exactly the same as the old buildings it was based off. It is simplified, and buildings made after the Renaissance follow these simplified rules.

Most of the architecture styles in Europe that were used after the Renaissance are classical architecture. This is a general use of the phrase "classical architecture". This general use is used by Sir John Summerson in The Classical Language of Architecture. The features of classical architecture have been used in different ways in different styles. For example, Baroque (or Rococo) architecture is different to classical architecture. Baroque or Rococo is based on classical architecture, but these styles have their own features, that are different to classical architecture. 

When Baroque architecture was used, people who learned about architecture still learned classical ideas. But they were not as important as during the Renaissance.

Palladian architecture is a style based on classical architecture. It is based on the style of Andrea Palladio (1508-1580). He was an architect from Venice. His style was important even after he died. In Britain, it was used for many good buildings in the 18th and 19th century. The style was mixed with the Georgian architecture that Britain made at the time.

At around 1750, architects began copying classical architecture again. They did this because Baroque architecture only copied some of classical architecture. These architects wanted to make buildings that used all the features of classical architecture. The style they made was called Neoclassicism.

New findings in archaeology meant architects knew more about classical architecture than before. The architects wanted clear rules for making buildings. Some of the first Neoclassical thinkers were Claude Perrault, Marc-Antoine Laugier, and Carlo Lodoli. Some of the most important Neoclassical architects were Étienne-Louis Boullée, Claude Nicolas Ledoux, Friedrich Gilly and John Soane. 

Neoclassical architecture was very important from 1750 to 1850. Neo-Gothic architecture was becoming more important at the same time. Neo-Gothic architecture was much less classical than Neoclassical. In the late 19th century, many styles of architecture were important. Many of the styles were not like classical architecture. For example, Art Nouveau and Eclecticism. 

Classical architecture was still important. Sometimes it would become very popular in one area. For example, Nordic Classicism was popular in the 1920s. But true classical architecture was never as popular as it was during the Renaissance.

When Modernism became popular in the early 20hth century, classical architecture mostly stopped being used.

Classical styles were important in America and Europe for a long time. From the Renaissance until Modernism began, classical architecture was very important. This means the architecture of Ancient Greece and Rome was used and changed into most new architecture styles. 

Architectural styles can come from classical architecture in different ways. For example, Neo-Palladian architecture is based on the buildings designed by Andrea Palladio, an architect from the Italian Renaissance. But Palladio based his architecture on Ancient Roman architecture. So Neo-Palladian architecture is based on classical architecture, even though it is mostly based on the works of Palladio.

Some styles are not classical, like Gothic, but they have classical features. This means it is hard to judge classical architecture's range of use. 

The most important part of classical architecture is features borrowed from ancient Greek and Roman architecture, and the rules architects made by learning about it.

Petrification is a word used to show how ancient Greek builders changed from using wood to using stone. It also shows the effect this had on the classical architecture style.

During the Archaic and early Classical times (6th and 5th centuries BC), early temples used a style of classical architecture called Doric.

Most historians think that the oldest temples were made with wood. Then the most important features of the buildings were used to make new buildings. This meant the style was the same, and all the buildings followed the same rules. 

After that, in Greece, stone was used instead of wood. But they used the same style. Because the style was "petrified" and kept the same, the word "petrification" is used to show this.

The Greeks wanted the buildings to look the same as they did when they were made of wood. Historians think this had a religious reason. Nobody knows why exactly, because it was so long ago.

Many places still used wood. For example, the Etruscans in Italy. Even though the Etruscans used some Greek culture and religion, they mostly kept using wood. The Etruscans knew how to use stone, but they didn't. They only started using stone when they became Roman.


Da Boom

"Da Boom" is the 3rd episode of the 2nd season of Family Guy. It was first shown on the Fox network on December 26, 1999. The episode is about the Griffin family after their city is destroyed from a nuclear explosion. This was because of Y2K (the Year 2000 problem). This is the first episode to have Mila Kunis as the voice actor for Meg Griffin.

The city of Quahog gets ready for the 2000 New Year. Peter Griffin is worried that Y2K will be the end of the world. Lois tells him many times that the world will not end, but Peter puts his family in the basement of their house. However, Y2K causes many nuclear explosions and other problems through all of the world. The Griffin family is safe, but their house is destroyed. The explosions have caused many problems for Quahog. For example, Meg's boyfriend dies in an explosion, Quagmire and Cleveland are stitched together, and Quahog's news anchors eat each other. Peter eats all of the food that was in the house. Peter thinks that Twinkies are the only food that does not get bad in a nuclear explosion. The Griffin family starts walking to a Twinkie factory in Natick, Massachusetts.

When they make it to Natick, they see a Twinkie factory that has no damage from the explosions. Peter makes a new town near the factory. Peter is the mayor and Joe, Quagmire, and Cleveland are part of the town's council. The town becomes a community with many houses. When Peter sees that the town is very peaceful, he thinks the town is not protected. He makes guns for everyone in the town. The people in the town are angry at Peter for using the pipes from their irrigation to make the guns. The Griffin family must leave the town. Stewie gets into radioactive waste and grows tentacles. Stewie lays eggs that hatches octopuses. The octopuses destroy the town after the Griffin family leaves. The family does not know what happened to the town and walks to another factory. 

The episode is then shown to be a dream from Pam Ewing. Ewing is a character from the television show "Dallas". Ewing goes to her husband Bobby Ewing and talks to him about her dream. Bobby does not know what "Family Guy" is. 

"Da Boom" was written by Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan. Bob Jaques is the director of the episode.

This is the first episode where Mila Kunis is the voice actor for Meg. Lacey Chabert was the voice actor for Meg for episodes made before this one. Chabert stopped being a voice actor so she can keep working on "Party of Five". Kunis had to do an audition to be the voice actor for Meg. In the audition, Seth MacFarlane (creator of "Family Guy") wanted Kunis to talk more slowly and clearly. After that, Kunis was put in the show.

The fictional character Ernie the Giant Chicken is first seen in this episode. He is a very big chicken and is an enemy of Peter Griffin. They can be seen fighting for a long part of the episode. They can be seen together in other episodes, for example, "Blind Ambition", "Internal Affairs", "No Chris Left Behind", and "Meet the Quagmires". Danny Smith is the voice actor for Ernie.

Victoria Principal, Will Sasso, Jack Perkins, Joey Slotnick, Patrick Duffy, Lori Alan, Danny Smith, and Patrick Warburton are guest stars in the episode.

Ashan Haque from IGN said that the episode "ranks as one of the best in the series." He thought that most of the jokes were funny and that the strange story is entertaining. Tom Eames from "Digital Spy" said that the episode could have been the first time fans could see the show as being very different from "The Simpsons". He said the episode is "Classic bonkers "Family Guy"."

Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States

The Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States or Blue Book is an American army book from the Revolutionary War. It is about how to teach soldiers to be good soldiers. Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben wrote the first version in 1777 and 1778 at Valley Forge. George Washington, Alexander Hamilton and other officers in the Continental Army helped. Von Steuben rewrote the book a year later.

At Valley Forge in the winter of 1777-1778, Acting Inspector General von Steuben saw that many Continental officers gave their men different drills. Drills are practice exercises. Using different drills meant the men might become confused in a real battle. Von Steuben wrote new drills for the whole army. He wrote them French. His aide-de-camp, Pierre Ettienne Duponceau, and George Washington's aides-de-camp, Alexander Hamilton and John Laurens rewrote them in English. General George Washington would read the drills and make changes. They gave each lesson to the officers one at a time. Then the officers or their helpers made their own copies. Then van Steuben and the officers would use the drills with the men.

The next year, in Philadelphia, von Steuben wrote down his Valley Forge drills in one book. He wrote it in French. Lieutenant Colonel Francois de Fleury helped. Then Captain Benjamin Walker and Duponceu rewrote the book in English. Captain Pierre Charles L'Enfant drew the pictures.

Congress decided to use the book starting in 1779. The American military used the Blue Book until 1814.

Base and superstructure

According to Marxism, society is made up of the base (substructure) and the superstructure. These two parts influence each other.

The base (economy) is made up of the means of production (such as land, factories, raw materials) and the relations of production, or the social relations people enter in order to survive (such as being an employer or an employee or what social class someone is part of).
The superstructure (ideology) is made up of the non-material things (such as institutions, laws, religion, culture) that make up society and shape how people think about themselves and their place in the world. The superstructure shows the interests of the ruling class.

The base shapes the superstructure. The superstructure defends how the base operates. For example, in capitalism, schools teach students why capitalism is good and how to participate in a capitalist economy.

The base and the superstructure need each other to exist. They also change over time.

Isolation for the purpose of abuse

Isolation is often used to get more power over a person. This power is then used for abuse. Isolating the victim from the outside world is important to get psychological control over the victim. Isolation reduces the opportunity of the victim to be rescued. It will also make the victim more dependent on the abuser.

This includes controlling a persons social activity: the people they see, the people they talk to, and the places they visit. Sometimes it also includes controlling the material they read. It can also include wanting to know where the victim is. Very often, a victim has to get permission to get medical treatment.

Isolation is often combined with other forms of abuse:


Cults often use these techniques.

Class consciousness

In Marxism, class consciousness is one's awareness (consciousness) of where one belongs in a system of social classes.

According to Marx, there are two classes in capitalism. They are the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The bourgeoisie take advantage of the proletariat and control the means of production. The proletariat class has more people than the bourgeoisie but do not own the means of production. The proletariat are usually workers.

According to Marxism, many members of the proletariat class have false consciousness. That means they usually think about themselves and are not aware of the class struggle going on in society or how the proletariat is being hurt by the bourgeoisie. An example of false consciousness would be the idea of the American Dream.

When enough members of the proletariat have class consciousness, they will be able to unite and overthrow the capitalist system.

Brad Raffensperger

Bradford Jay Raffensperger (born May 18, 1955) is an American politician, businessman, and civil engineer. He is a Republican. He is the Secretary of State of Georgia since 2019. He was in the Georgia House of Representatives.

Around January 3, 2021, a scandal which had Donald Trump try to push Raffensperger to "find more votes" to make Trump the winner in Georgia over the actual winner Joe Biden.

Trump–Raffensperger phone call

On January 2, 2021, former U.S. President Donald Trump called Brad Raffensperger, the Secretary of State of Georgia, for an hour-long telephone call telling him to change the state's vote totals from the 2020 presidential election. Joe Biden won the state in November. Trump has refused to accept the presidential election. 

Trump's call with Raffensperger was first reported by "The Washington Post" and other media outlets the day after it took place.

At one point on the call, Trump told Raffensperger, "What I want to do this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state." Trump lost Georgia by 11,779 votes, so 11,780 votes would be 1 vote more for him.

Many believe that Trump should be criminally investigated and impeached. Many Republicans and Democrats criticized Trump's phone call.

In the United States, the winner of a presidential election is not the person with the most votes. Instead, it is the person who wins the most votes in the electoral college. In this process, a group of people called electors vote for president. Each state has a certain number of electors depending on how many people live there. There are 538 electors in all. For a person to become president, he or she must get 270 or more votes from the electors.

When a presidential candidate wins the most votes in a state, all of those state's electoral votes go to that person.

Elections are done by each state, which means there were 50 different elections going on at the same time. Each state has its own rules about who is allowed to vote.

The Secretary of State is in charge of each state's elections.

Georgia has 16 electoral votes. That means that it makes 16 people electors. Biden got the most votes in Georgia so all 16 electoral votes went to him. A lot of people were surprised because Trump got the most votes in Georgia in 2016. Usually, Republican candidates have gotten the most votes in Georgia.

Brad Raffensperger was elected Secretary of State in 2018. He and Trump are both members of the Republican Party.

Trump was not very happy about Georgia's electoral votes going to Biden. He said that there was cheating in the Georgia elections and that votes were changed so that Biden would get more. He said government officials in Georgia allowed electoral fraud and made him lose. He asked them to count the votes again. They did, but Biden still got the most votes.

On January 2, 2021, Trump called Raffensperger. He said that he won Georgia by "hundreds of thousands of votes" and that the results were wrong. Neither of these are true. Then he asked Raffensperger to "find" 11,780 votes and add them to the results so that he could be the winner.

According to federal and state law, trying to change the results of an election and making someone do so are illegal. That means that Trump might have broken the law by trying to make Raffensperger change the results of the elections in Georgia.

Ethnography

Ethnography is a kind of anthropology. Ethnographers study specific cultures.

Ethnography mostly uses participant observation. The researcher becomes part of the setting or mixes with the people being studied. They try to record patterns of social interaction and the thoughts and experiences of participants. Ethnographers want to understand these in their local contexts. Ethnography started in social and cultural anthropology in the early twentieth century. It spread to other social sciences, especially sociology.

Ethnographers mainly use qualitative methods. They may also use quantitative data.

According to Dewan (2018), ethnographers do not try to find generalized results. They study cultures in context and in a specific situation. The best way to use ethnography with quantitative research is to discover relationships. Then, use the results and data to test and explain empirical assumptions.

The word ethnography comes from Greek words "ethnos" "folk, people, nation" and "grapho" "I write")

Peter, MJ, and Ned apply for college but their applications are rejected because of Peter being Spider-Man. Peter goes to Doctor Strange and asks him to cast a spell to make people forget he is Spider-Man. He damages the spell by changing it too much, however, making it so that people from other universes who know he is Spider-Man come to this universe. On Queensboro Bridge, Peter finds an administrator from the college he wanted to go to and tries to get her to accept him and his friends' applications. However, Doctor Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus arrives on the bridge and attacks Peter. Octavius is defeated, realizing that this Peter isn't from his universe.

Suddenly, Norman Osborn / Green Goblin attacks them both. Before they can fight, Peter is brought back by Strange, who has already caught Curt Connors / Lizard. He tells Peter to capture the villains who came through. Peter finds Max Dillon / Electro and captures him with the help of the Flint Marko / Sandman, who Peter also captures. Osborn is retrieved after going to a F.E.A.S.T. building seeking help.

After beating Peter in a fight, the Goblin kills May and escapes. Meanwhile, MJ and Ned learn how to open portals using Strange’s Sling Ring which they use in an attempt to find Peter, only to find the Spider-Men from the villains universes. The Peter from Osborn, Octavius, and Marko's universe is called Peter-2 and the Peter from Connors and Dillon's universe is called Peter-3.

Peter is found by Ned and MJ, who comfort him. The other Spider-Men tell him their own stories and encourage him to fight in May's honour. They make the cures for the villains and meet Marko, Connors, and Dillon on the Statue of Liberty, with Ned and MJ following them. The villains are cured, with Octavius and Strange arriving to help them. Before Strange can send them back, the Goblin attacks and blows up the spell. MJ is knocked off by the explosion and nearly falls to her death, but Peter-3 saves her, bringing him closure for not saving Gwen Stacy. An angry Peter attacks the Goblin and nearly kills him, but Peter-3 stops him. The Goblin then stabs Peter-3. Peter injects him with the cure, restoring him to a regretful Norman. Strange stops the spell and sends everyone back by making everyone forget who Peter is. Peter later tries to tell MJ the truth, but cannot bring himself to do it. He visits May's grave and vows to carry on.

Alienation (Marxism)

In Marxism, alienation is a feeling that people have when they don't feel connected to the society around them and their work.

According to Marx, there are four types of alienation in a capitalist society:


Because of alienation, people have no control over their lives or over the things they make. Instead, the products of their labor are exchanged for wages in order to survive.

In this type of alienation, a worker cannot relate to the work he or she is doing. For example, someone can screw parts into a toy without seeing the rest of the toy when it is done. This type of alienation increased after people started doing work in assembly lines. Before then, people would make things from start to finish.
A worker does not control the means of production. He or she just does the things that is taught to them. For example, a worker might need to make shirts in the same style and cannot experiment with patterns or designs.

In a capitalist society, a worker will be in competition with other workers for a small number of jobs. Because of this, they cannot cooperate with each other and fight for their shared interests as workers.

Finally, people are alienated from their identity that they get from doing their work. Marx called this identity "Gattungswesen" (German for "species-essence" or "human nature"). For example, someone who just screws parts into a toy will not feel like a toymaker because he or she is not really "making" toys.

Ethel Byrne

Ethel Higgins Byrne (1883-1955) was an American Progressive Era radical feminist. She was the younger sister of birth control activist Margaret Sanger, and assisted her in this work.

Michael Hennessey Higgins and Anne Higgins had a family with eleven children. They had an Irish American background. Ethel and Margaret were two of the children. Her mother preferred Ethel. Margaret did not like this, and it caused problems in their relationship..

Ethel had a short and unhappy marriage to Jack Byrne, a glassworker. They had two children, Jack and Olive. In 1906, Ethel left her children in the care of their paternal grandparents to protect them from their abusive father; Ethel only visited her daughter once in sixteen years. Olive grew up to become an important muse to the creator of Wonder Woman, William Moulton Marston, and more details of Ethel Byrne's life came to light when Jill Lepore wrote about the superheroine character in 2014.

Ethel Byrne's background in nursing was very important to her activism. It directly contributed to her desire to make birth control accessible to women of varying backgrounds. She was a trained nurse who assisted immigrant women who needed medical care in the Brownsville area of Brooklyn, New York in 1916.

The two sisters and theatre artist Fania Mindell opened a birth control clinic in Brooklyn in October 1916. They made flyers in different languages, including English, Yiddish and Italian,to advertise their cliniic. Byrne is not widely known today. Despite this, her early activism had a big impact on raising awareness of the importance of access to information about birth control. When Ethel Byrne was arrested, a group of politically active New York women wanted to meet President Woodrow Wilson. They wanted Wilson to undo laws that made distributing bith control a crime. 

The clinic was highly controversial because the Comstock Laws were enforced. Byrne and Sanger distributed pessaries and would show their clients how to use this method of contraception in direct violation of these laws.

This was the first birth control clinic in the United States. The clinic caused an immediate sensation in the press. It got national attention, and all three women were arrested and tried for "distributing obscene materials".

All three women were found guilty. After some time, the verdicts were overturned, and their campaign was successful in the end. This caused major changes in social policy and to the laws governing birth control and sex education around the world. The clinic closed but later became the basis for what was to become known as Planned Parenthood.

Byrn was arrested for distributing information about bith control. She was sentenced to 30 days in Blackwell's Island prison. She was jailed at Blackwell Island workhouse on January 22, 1917 for her activism and subsequently went on a hunger strike. Sanger was concerned her sister would die as a result of this hunger strike and Byrne was force fed while serving her sentence after 185 hours without food or water. As historian Jill Lepore reports in "The Secret History of Wonder Woman," Ethel Byrne was the first female political prisoner in the United States to be subjected to force feeding. Mrs. Byrne was prepared to starve herself to death in support of her cause. Her case was the first of a group of cases known as the "Sanger cases" to be brought to trial.

Sanger supported Byrne's activism. Their confinement helped bring national attention to their push for the legalization of birth control. It also hurt their relationship as Sanger's notoriety grew after this arrest and she was sometimes known to take credit for Ethel's infamous hunger strike.

Although her sister went on to become world-famous for her advocacy of birth control, Byrne's legacy is not well known. This is apparent on the Planned Parenthood website, as it is noted Sanger opened her 1916 clinic with "her sister". Ethel is not even mentioned by name and unlike her older sister is not well known

Ethel Byrne had a stroke and died in 1955. She did not live to see the legalization of the birth control pill, as she died five years before it received FDA approval.

Primitive communism

Primitive communism is a term that was used by Karl Marx and Fredrich Engels to describe hunter-gatherer societies and how they shared resources among each other. Primitive means in the early stages of development, so primitive communism is an early form of communism.

In a primitive communist society, there is no extra stuff for people to hoard. Instead, things like food and housing are shared equally among all members of the community. There was no such thing as money. Also, everyone in a primitive communist society had to help get food. There was no authoritarianism and no concept of a state. Instead, everyone has an equal say in what goes on in the society. This is called egalitarianism.

Agriculture led to the creation of the private ownership of land. The extra food that could be grown meant that some people didn't have to work to get food. These people started to get other jobs and that led to the creation of social class. This is when people started thinking that some jobs were more important than others and when slavery became a thing.

Marx and Engels got the idea of primitive communism from an American man named Lewis H. Morgan. Morgan did a lot of research on the Iroquois people, who lived in big groups and shared everything that they grew, hunted, and gathered. Marx and Engels thought that the Iroquois lived in a society that had communist traits.

It has been writing about the 2020 Belarusian protests and 2020 Belarusian presidential election, so several journalists of the Brest newspaper have been tried and arrested for that.

In October 2020, the newspaper joined a common statement by the Belarusian Association of Journalists and private media companies on the troubles of TUT.BY and limits on the use of private websites. The newspaper took a strong civil position against violence in writing about the Belarusian protests. The newspaper started buying and sending its copies to political prisoners. "Brestskaya Gazeta" printed their answers to its letters in prisons.

Chief of the Belarusian Association of Journalists Andrei Bastunets said that the troubles made to Brestskaya Gazeta support the government' pressure on the regional news media, as "the fact that this is happening at the level of economic objects should make anyone foolish."

To stay away from punishment for not made transportation, it was chosen in time to give up on Belposhta's (Belpost (), Belarusian postal service) subscription services for the first part of 2021. On January 19, 2021, it became known that Brestskaya Gazeta has stopped to be made for now. All printing houses in Belarus had made decisions not to print the newspaper.

On July 8, 2021, the office and the houses of its main people were looked for. Two days later Brestskaya Gazeta said that all the technical devices (computers. smartphones and tools like that) of its people were taken away.

A court in Brest added the newspaper’s website to the list of extremist materials in November 2021, and its Telegram channel in April 2022.

In 2023, the KGB labeled Brestskaya Gazeta as an extremist group. Participation in an extremist group is a criminal offense under Belarusian law.

Edna Krabappel

Edna Krabappel is a fictional character in the television show "The Simpsons". She is the fourth grade teacher of Bart Simpson's class. In the 23rd season, it is shown that she was married to Ned Flanders. Flanders's first wife died in season 11. 

Marcia Wallace was the voice actor for Edna Krabappel. Wallace died in 2013. When she died, Krabappel was not in many episodes after that.

She is a fourth grade teacher at Springfield Elementary School. She does not like her job as a teacher. In the episode "The Seemingly Never-Ending Story", it is shown that she liked to teach and help others. However, the school's bad quality and Bart Simpson made her annoyed to be at the school.

Edna smokes a lot, even inside the school. In the episode "Grade School Confidential", she gets in an intimate relationship with the school's principal, Seymour Skinner. They use Bart to give messages to each other when he is in classrooms. Bart gets angry and tells all of the students about the relationship. Skinner and Edna get fired by Superintendent Chalmers, but they get their jobs back at the end of the episode. In the episode "Bart Gets a 'Z'", she gets fired because she was drunk at the school. She gets her job back at the end of the episode because the substitute teacher also gets drunk. In the episode "The Ned-Liest Catch", she gets suspended and put in a reassignment center for hurting Bart. Bart tries to get her out, but Edna falls from a ladder. Ned Flanders stops her from falling.

Edna's first husband cheated on her. She told Nelzon Muntz about it by saying he "chased something small and fluffy down the rabbit hole". This is a metaphor for having an affair. In the episode "Flaming Moe's", she tries to seduce Joey Kramer and Homer Simpson. The episode "Bart the Lover" has Bart pretending to be a man that loves Edna.

In "Grade School Confidential", her relationship with Skinner almost made them married. However, in "My Big Fat Geek Wedding", Skinner does not want to marry Edna. This made Edna sad and their relationship became unstable. In "The Seemingly Never-Ending Story", it is shown that she liked Moe Szyslak before she was a teacher. When she first met Bart Simpson, Moe stopped the relationship.

In "The Ned-Liest Catch", Ned and Edna started dating. The end of the episode asked fans if Ned and Edna should be in a relationship. Most of the fans answered yes. The episode also showed that Edna dated many other people before. In "Ned 'n Edna's Blend Agenda", Ned and Edna got married, but not in public. After Edna's voice actor Wallace died, Edna is shown to have died in the show. The episode "Left Behind" has Ned become a teacher so he can think of Edna more.

Krabappel's family name (last name) was named after the fruit "crabapple". This is a reference to the character Miss Crabtree from "Our Gang".

Marcia Wallace won an Emmy Award (for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance) in 1992 for being the voice actor of Edna. Tilda Swinton said that she made her hair look like Edna's in the movie "Burn After Reading".

Marcia Wallace died on October 25, 2013. The people who worked on the show said that they knew that she was ill. Al Jean (the show's showrunner) was very sad when he learned that Marcia Wallace died. He said that the show will retire her character. This means that she will not usually be in episodes anymore. In "Four Regrettings and a Funeral", the episode's chalkboard gag says "We'll really miss you Mrs. K".

Standardization

In order to be able to work together, people and companies need to agree on a common set of rules, and units. These agreements are called standards. The process of agreeing is called standardization or standardisation. 

Companies that have products which follow these rules can make their products work together. One example of a standard is the two pin plug. It provides electricity. It is commonly found in household appliances. Many countries have adopted it. However, this is not the case for three-pin plugs: they are different in each country. 

Agreements do not need to be technical. Lawyers can agree on a standard way to solve a problem, linguists can agree on what the "standard language" is, and bookkeepers can agree on rules how to evaluate a company.

In June 1978, Ford recalled over 1.5 million Ford Pintos and Mercury Bobcats, the largest automotive industry recall at that time. Ford, however, disagreed with the NHTSA finding of a defect.

Child marriage

A child marriage is a marriage or other similar union between an adult and a child. The child is under a certain age, usually 18. Most child marriages are between a girl and a man, and are rooted in gender inequality. It can also be the marriage of two children. There's a minimum age for a person to be able to marry. This age is called marriable age. Very often, it is similar to the age of consent. 

As of 2019, child marriage affects about 765 million people; 650 million of them are girls or young women. There's no widely accepted definition of what child marriage is. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child says that in a child marriage, at least one of the people entering marriage has not reached age 18. Even though mosts states have a minimal age at which people can be married, this is often not respected. There may be cultural or religious reasons. Other reasons why someone is married as a child include that the parents want to make sure the girl is a virgin, when she gets married. Another reason may be that the family cannot afford the education or the upkeep of the child; when the child is married, there are no more costs to the family. Poverty is one of the main reasons for child marriage. 

The age when children legally turn into adults, and the age at which they can legally marry are usually at 18 years of age. The age when they can marry may be different from country to country. Even when it is set at 18, people may marry when they are younger, given that their parents agree. There may also be special circumstances, such as a teenage pregnancy.

Child marriage violates the rights of children. It has long-term consequences for child brides and child grooms. Very often, girls that went to school before they were married stop going to school. Because of poor education, their career opportunities are limited. An early pregnancy and childbirth also has adverse health effects on girls. For boys the situation is similar: they may not be well prepared for their role as a father. Also because they have not finished their education, their career opportunities are limited. Child marriage includes civil cohabitation and court-approved early marriages after teenage pregnancy.

Causes of child marriages include poverty, dowry, cultural traditions, illiteracy, and the thoughts that women are unable to work for money. Research shows that to some extent telling children about sex can help prevent child marriage.

Child marriages have been common throughout history. They are still fairly widespread, particularly in developing countries such as parts of Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, West Asia, Latin America, and Oceania. Even in developed countries such as the United States legal exceptions mean that 17 US states have no minimum age requirement for marriage. The incidence of child marriage has been falling in most parts of the world. 2018 data from UNICEF showed that about 21 percent of young women worldwide (aged 20 to 24) were married as children. This is a 25 percent decrease from 10 years before. The countries with the highest observed rates of child marriages below the age of 18 were Niger, Chad, Mali, Bangladesh, Guinea, the Central African Republic, Mozambique, and Nepal with rates above 50%. Niger, Chad, Bangladesh, Mali and Ethiopia were the countries with child marriage rates greater than 20% below the age of 15, according to 2003–2009 surveys. Globally, an estimated 12 million girls annually are being married under the age of 18. Child marriage is common among Roma people, also known as Gypsies.

In 2007, a photo won the UNICEF photo of the year award, that shows a 40-year-old man with his 11-year-old bride.


Waimakariri River

The Waimakariri River is one of the largest rivers in Canterbury, New Zealand. It is on the eastern coast of New Zealand's South Island. It flows for southeast from the Southern Alps across the Canterbury Plains to the Pacific Ocean.

The river is a fine example of a braided river. As the photograph shows, for much of its upper reaches, the river is braided. It runs across wide shingle beds. As the river approaches the Canterbury Plains, it passes through a belt of mountains. There it is forced into a narrow canyon (the Waimakariri Gorge). Then it goes back to its braided form across the plains. It enters the Pacific north of Christchurch, near the town of Kaiapoi.

Most New Zealand river beds are unoccupied crown land, but the bed of the Waimakariri River is looked after by the Canterbury Regional Council (Environment Canterbury).

Windows Whistler

Windows Whistler is the codename for Windows XP operating system released in 2001.

In the late 1990s, initial development of what would become Windows XP was focused on two individual products; "Odyssey", which was reportedly intended to succeed the future Windows 2000, and "Neptune", which was reportedly a consumer-oriented operating system using the Windows NT architecture, succeeding the MS-DOS-based Windows 98. Based on the NT 5.0 kernel in Windows 2000, Neptune primarily focused on offering a simplified interface. A single build of Neptune, 5111, revealed early work on the activity center concept, with an updated user account interface and graphical login screen, common functions (such as recently used programs) being accessible from a customizable "Starting Places" page (which could be used as either a separate window, or a full-screen desktop replacement). It was later confirmed that Microsoft were planning a successor to Neptune known as Triton, although it was originally thought to be a service pack to Neptune.

However, the project proved to be too ambitious. Microsoft discussed a plan to delay Neptune in favor of an interim OS known as "Asteroid", which would have been an update to Windows 2000 (Windows NT 5.0), and have a consumer-oriented version. At the WinHEC conference on April 7, 1999, Steve Ballmer announced an updated version of Windows 98 known as Windows Millennium, breaking a promise made by Microsoft CEO Bill Gates in 1998 that Windows 98 would be the final consumer-oriented version of Windows to use the MS-DOS architecture. 

In January 2000, shortly prior to the official release of Windows 2000, technology writer Paul Thurrott reported that Microsoft had shelved both Neptune and Odyssey in favour of a new product codenamed "Whistler". The goal of Whistler was to unify both the consumer and business-oriented Windows lines under a single platform. At WinHEC in April 2000, Microsoft officially announced and presented an early build of Whistler.

In June 2000, Microsoft began the technical beta testing process. Whistler was expected to be made available in "Personal", "Professional", "Server", "Advanced Server", and "Datacenter" editions. At PDC on July 13, 2000, Microsoft announced that Whistler would be released during the second half of 2001, and also released the first preview build, 2250. The build notably introduced an early version of a new visual styles system along with an interim theme known as "Professional" (later renamed "Watercolor"), and a hidden, early version of a two-column Start menu design. Watercolor was never meant to be the final theme for Whistler; in fact, it has been stated that Microsoft used it as a decoy until they were ready to show Luna. Build 2257 featured the official introduction of the two-column Start menu, and the addition of an early version of Windows Firewall.

Liberia civil wars

There were two civil wars in Liberia, which lasted from 1989 to 2003. Liberia is made of multiple ethnic groups. In the civil wars these groups fought for power and influence. On the other hand, there were warlords, who fought each other. The civil wars were also about who had control of the natural resources of the country. Child soldiers were common during these wars. 

The first war lasted from 1989 to 1996. Charles Taylor started an armed uprising against president Samuel Doe. Doe was quickly captured, and one of Taylor's associates, Yormie Johnson, tortured him to death. Johnson later split from Taylor, and founded his own movement. The supporters of Doe also founded their own movement, fighting went on between the different factions. All parties were very brutal when it came to interactions with civilians. Joshua Milton Blahyi, a young warlord, who was better known as General Butt Naked, was especially cruel. Using child soldiers, he is said to have killed 20,000 civilians. The UN enforced an embargo against Liberia. 

At the same time, there was a civil war in Sierra Leone. Charles Taylor supported a rebel force in Sierra Leone. He is said to have traded with blood diamonds. 

The first war lasted until 1996. In 1997, Taylor was elected president. He obtained about 75% of the votes, the elections were called free and fair.

The former enemies of Taylor didn't want to accept the election result, and they started the second war, in 1999. In 2003, the government held control over a third of the country, two thirds were controlled by rebel groups. In 2003, an international arrest warrant was issued against Taylor, for crimes he had committed when supporting the rebels in Sierra Leone. Taylor agreed to step down and leave the county, which ended the war. 

Because of both wars, about 250,000 people were killed. Over a million became displaced people or refugees. Some stayed in refugee camps in Liberia, others fled to the neighboring countries. 

The wars had a big impact on the economy, which can still be seen. In some regions in Liberia, up to 85% of the workforce are unemployed.

Brother's Little Helper

"Brother's Little Helper" is the 2nd episode of the 11th season of The Simpsons. It was first shown on the Fox network on October 3, 1999. The episode is about Bart Simpson getting a prescription to take a drug. 

The episode was written by George Meyer. Mark Kirkland is the director of the episode. Meyer did not like his first writing of the episode. He used a fake name when he showed others his writing. The episode makes humor of children in school being misdiagnosed (diagnosed wrong) with ADHD. Mark McGwire is a guest star for the episode.

Principal Skinner teaches his students about fire prevention. However, Bart makes a very big wave that floods the school's gym and schoolyard. Skinner is very angry at Bart. Skinner tells Homer and Marge that Bart has been diagnosed with ADHD. Bart must take the drug Focusyn (a parody of Ritalin). Marge is worried because Focusyn is a new drug and it might not be safe. 

Bart takes Focusyn and does better in school. He is good to his parents and he is the tutor of a Navajo boy. However, Bart starts to feel paranoid. He thinks that Major League Baseball is spying on the town with satellites. A doctor tells Bart to stop taking Focusyn. Bart does not want to and overdoses.

Bart goes to a military base and takes a tank. He drives the tank to his school. Bart shoots at the sky. A satellite from Major League Baseball falls from the sky with documents on what everyone does. Mark McGwire comes from the satellite and distracts everyone. He puts the documents under his cap. He gives Bart a baseball bat so he can keep spying on the Simpson family. 

"Brother's Little Helper" was written by George Meyer. The episode was first named "Bart a Go Go". "Bart's Inner Child" was the last episode he wrote himself before this one. He was tired after writing that episode. He came back to writing with this episode. He thought it was not easy to write the episode because he was going through "psychological problems". He did not like what he wrote, so he showed it to the other writers using a fake name (a pseudonym). Tim Long said that it was "an amazing draft". Matt Selman came up with the idea of Bart getting a tank. He said that he got the idea after watching the news on a guy who died going "nuts with a tank".

The side effects of Focusyn on Bart were shown with many small changes to him. When Bart is reading a book, a line below his cheek is added. Bart is later seen speed reading and his pupils are smaller. The animators were not sure if Bart's pupils should be bigger or smaller than normal. Kirkland said that there were many model sheets (pictures that help animators draw characters) "going back and forth over the fax machines". The animators made Bart's pupils smaller in the episode. When Bart is with a doctor, he swallows many pills. He was first going to swallow all of the pills in the jar, but the censors did not like it. Mark McGwire is a guest star for the episode. Mike Scully said that McGwire was "probably the biggest man" he had seen and that he "did a great job".

Robert Canning from IGN thought that the episode is "funny" and that it is better than other episodes from the 11th season. However, he thought that the part of the episode with McGwire was not as funny as it should have been. Brian Tallerico from The Deadbolt thought that it was one of the best episodes of the season. Colin Jacobsson from DVD Movie Guide said that the episode has "some good laughs". He likes the morals of the episode but he did not like how Bart acted when he was on too much Focusyn.

Deroy Murdock from Scripps Howard News Service said that the episode "predicts the news." He says this because Bill Clinton had a conference five months after the episode was shown on television. The conference was about students taking too much drugs. The word "exorcism tongs" was made up in the episode. Cracked.com put the word in a list of the best words that were made up by "The Simpsons". In the episode, Homer eats taffy with Focusyn inside it and starts to act crazy. Todd Flanders asks his father Ned if Homer has "a demon". Ned tells him "Looks like it. Run and get daddy's exorcism tongs."


Armenian mythology

Armenian mythology comes from ancient Indo-European traditions. The earliest Armenian traditions (called Proto-Armenian) developed into Armenian mythology. Gradually, Anatolian, Hurro-Urartian, Mesopotamian, Iranian, and Greek beliefs and deities became a part of Armenian mythology.

The early religions in Armenia are not that well known. According to De Morgan there are signs which indicate that the Armenians, as their other Aryan relatives, were initially nature worshipers and that this faith in time was transformed to the worship of national gods, of which many were the equivalents of the gods in the Roman, Greek and Persian cultures.

Georg Brandes described the Armenian gods in his book: “When Armenia accepted Christianity, it was not only the temples which were destroyed, but also the songs and poems about the old gods and heroes that the people sang. We have only rare segments of these songs and poems, segments which bear witness of a great spiritual wealth and the power of creation of this people and these alone are sufficient reason enough for recreating the temples of the old Armenian gods. These gods were neither the Asian heavenly demons nor the precious and the delicate Greek gods, but something that reflected the characteristics of the Armenian people which they have been polishing through the ages, namely ambitious, wise and good-hearted.”

Slash-and-burn

Slash-and-burn is a technique that has been used for thousands of years. Usually at the start of the dry season, a plot of land is cleared of its vegetation. Very often, this is done manually, for example using machetes. This can take a long time, clearing a hectare can take up to 120 hours of work. If the land is to be used for crops that last more than two years, the roots need to be cleared as well. Usually this is not done for annual plants. The plants cleared are left to dry, often for weeks. When they are dry enough, they are burnt. The ash that is created makes the soil fertile. Weeds, and other pests have also been eliminated, so the field can be used for agriculture. After three to five years, the extra fertility is gone, and the farmer usually moves to another field (or again uses slash-and-burn).

While the technique is very simple, it also has problems: Often, fires created get out of control, and more land is burned than necessary. That way, a territory the size of Belgium burned down in a fire, created in 1989, in the state of Roraima in Brazil. In general, there are few large fires in the rainforest. the climate is very wet, and rivers block the fires. In southeast Asia, between May and October, many people have health problems because of the clouds of smoke. During that time, slash-and-burn operations happen in Indonesia. These fires are responsible for the clouds. 

Millions of people use slash-and-burn agriculture, often as a way of subsistence farming. For this reason, the practice cannot be outlawed. Some steps can be taken ot lessen the impact on the ecosystem:

Faxian's visit to India occurred during the reign of Chandragupta II. He is also renowned for his pilgrimage to Lumbini, the birthplace of Gautama Buddha (modern Nepal). However, he mentioned nothing about Guptas. Faxian claimed that demons and dragons were the original inhabitants of Sri Lanka.

After two years stay on Ceylon, Faxian was coming back to China. Suddenly a violent storm drove his ship onto an island, probably Java. After five months there, Faxian took another ship for southern China. But, again, it was blown off course and he ended up landing at Mount Lao in what is now Shandong in northern China, east of the city of Qingdao.

The area was surveyed for the first time by Benjamin Wright in 1796. Watertown had its first residents in 1798.

The city became the county seat of Jefferson County in 1805. Watertown was incorporated as a village in 1816, and became a city in 1869.

In the 21st century, Watertown is a big part of upstate New York. Watertown has a lot of business with visitors from Canada, because the city is only away from the border of Canada. Watertown, South Dakota was named after the city.

Watertown was named because of the Black River, which flows through the city. It is not known who chose the name of Watertown, but most people think that the early settlers had an agreement. The name was chosen so that mills would be built. By 1850, Watertown and places next to Watertown had a lot of mills in them.

Alexander Macomb purchased the land of Jefferson, Lewis, St. Lawrence, and Oswego county in 1791. Alexander Macomb sent surveyors to sell the land to settlers who passed by. The area was surveyed for the first time by Benjamin Wright in 1796. After returning, Benjamin Wright said: 

The first people to live in Watertown, Hart Massey, Henry Coffeen, and Zachariah Butterfield, built cabins on the area that is now the public square in 1798 while migrating from New England after the Revolutionary War. When the settlers first surveyed Watertown, the land in the area was rocky and uncleared. The western end of the Public Square was about higher than the western end. The middle of the square had a depression that was said to be big enough for a big skating rink. The settlers chose to live in Watertown because of the water power that the Black River gave. The area of Watertown was taken from the nearby town of Mexico on March 14, 1800. On March 1, 1801, Hart Massey moved his wife and three children into the cabins. In 1805, settlers cleared out the center of the town to create the public square. Many buildings were built next to the public square in the 19th and 20th centuries, and the public square was made a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places on September 7, 1984.

When Watertown became the county seat, it was one of the smallest places in the county. Watertown was incorporated as a village in 1816, and became a city in 1869.

On May 13, 1849, a fire destroyed most of public square and three surrounding streets, and a lot of the square had to be rebuilt. The fire killed one person, and destroyed almost all of the businesses in the city. The fire destroyed three banks, a post office, three printing offices, two hotels, and thirty shops. It costed $250,000, about $7,529,000 today, to fix the damage. While rebuilding in 1853, the city made two parks in the middle of the square, with a fountain in the middle.

Little Trees were invented in Watertown in 1951, and the headquarters of Little Trees is also in Watertown. In the 1960s through the 1990s, New York destroyed many historic buildings, like the Woodruff Hotel and the old courthouse. In the 1980s, unemployment in the area went up by 20%.

Each episode shows the squirrels complete an activity or adventure relating to a badge, that the squirrels earn at the end of the episodes. There is no set formula for every episode, with many episodes referencing or parodying pop culture.

"Hey Duggee" has four series. It was first shown in December 2014. BBC and Studio AKA produced a second series in early 2016, with the first episode airing in the United Kingdom on 26 September 2016. A third series was commissioned in October 2017, with the first episode due to be broadcast in Autumn 2018, but was pushed back to 4 March 2019.

The production team consists of around 16 in-house animators, with six to eight scriptwriters.


Great Purge

The Great Purge or the Great Terror (), was a purge in the Soviet Union from 1936 to 1938. 

It was a large-scale "repression" of the more wealthy peasants ("kulaks"). Ethnic minorities were murdered. Even members of the Communist Party, government officials, and the Red Army leadership were killed. 

Everyone was watched by the police. Everyone was suspected. People were imprisoned without a fair trial. Executions were common. Historians think the total number of deaths due to Stalinist repression in 1937–38 was between 950,000 to 1.2 million.

The "Kulak Operation" and the targeting of national minorities made up the Great Terror. Together these two actions caused nine-tenths of the death sentences and three-fourths of Gulag prison camp sentences. 

In the Western world, Robert Conquest's 1968 book "The Great Terror" popularized the phrase. Conquest's title was a reminder of the French Revolution time known as the Reign of Terror (French: "la Terreur", "the Terror"; from June to July 1794: "la Grande Terreur", 'the Great Terror').

The term dyke is a slang term. It is used as a noun for lesbians. It is also used as an adjective for things related to lesbianism. It began as a homophobic and misogynistic term on par with the word faggot, Dyke means a masculine or manly girl or woman.

The origin of the term "dyke" is obscure. Many theories have come out. Most theories tell that "dyke" comes off the word "bulldyke", which has a similar meaning.

From the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, "dike" had been American slang for the well-dressed man. "Diked out" and "out on the dike" meant a young man was in his best clothes.

The word "dyke" was used in the 1950s as a derogatory term for lesbians by straight people. But it was also used by lesbians of higher social status to mean crude and rough-bar lesbians.

Facebook censored use of the word "dyke" as "abusive content" in June 2017 on its website. The decision triggered a Change.org protest petition created by the "Listening 2 Lesbians" collective. It was signed by 7,247 supporters.

1988–90 North American drought

The 1988–90 North American drought was a weather problem that lasted two years. The drought began in 1988 in the Midwestern United States, High Plains and the Northeastern United States. A number of high pressure areas set themselves up over several parts of these areas, restricting thunderstorms from developing.

During the spring of 1988, Milwaukee, Wisconsin had 55 days straight without any precipitation. In the summer, two record-setting heat waves developed, similar to 1934, 1936 and 1983–85. The constant heat waves led to as many as 17,000 deaths in the United States. 

During the summer of 1988, the drought led to a number of wildfires in western North America. That included the Yellowstone fires of 1988. 

At its peak, the drought covered 45% of the United States in 1988 alone. That's less area than the Dust Bowl, which covered 70% of the United States. But the Drought of 1988 caused $60 billion in damage. That not only is the most expensive drought in the history of the United States, it was the costliest natural disaster before Hurricane Katrina seventeen years later.

The drought destroyed crops nationwide. Lawns went brown. A number of cities ordered water restrictions. 

More than four inches of helpful rain came to the Midwest through Hurricane Gilbert. The storm crossed Texas and Oklahoma as a tropical depression. It spread rain as far as the Great Lakes. Other locations, however, were at -6 or lower on the Palmer Drought Severity Index by early autumn 1988.

Dry conditions continued into 1989 and 1990, affecting Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota,Illinois, Colorado, Kansas and Missouri.

The 1988–90 drought caused damage comparable to Hurricane Andrew in August 1992 and Hurricane Katrina in August 2005.

Menoetius (moon)

Menoetius is the only moon of the asteroid Trojan 617 Patroclus.

In 2001, scientists found that Patroclus is a binary system, made up of two asteroids of about the same size. It is one of 18 binary Trojan asteroids known to exist. In 2006, good measurements of the orbit from the Keck Laser guide star adaptive optics system were reported.

It was estimated that the two components orbit around their center of mass in days at a distance of in a roughly circular orbit. Combining these observations with thermal measurements taken in 2000, the sizes of the components of the system were estimated at 106 km and 98 km, with an equivalent whole-system diameter of 145 km, refined by later measurements from the Keck Observatory to approximately 122 km and 112 km for each partner, and a co-orbital period of hours ( days).

On 21 October 2013, both bodies occulted a magnitude 8.8 star as observed by a team of 41 observers stationed across the USA. Observation data put the orbital distance of 664.6 km, and give a size for the slightly larger component, which retains the name Patroclus with overall volume equivalent to a 113 km sphere, with the smaller component now named Menoetius with a volume equivalent to a 104 km diameter sphere.

The words of the song were written by Lorenz Leopold Haschka in 1797, and in that same year, the music was composed by the famous musician Joseph Haydn. The melody would later be used in other songs, such as "Deutschlandlied", the German national anthem.

After empire broke up, the hymn was later replaced by "Deutschösterreich, du herrliches Land" in Austria, and "Himnusz" in Hungary.

Due to the popularity of the anthem, it has been translated into many different languages.

In 1854, the words of the song was changed by Johann Gabriel Seidl.

Namahage

One of the strangest events takes place around Akita.  It is called Namahage.  Namahage is a traditional culture in Akita prefecture.  The main event of namahage is very terrible for children.  The frightfully dressed men portray Namahage equipped with masks, knives and traditional capes made of straw during a New Year's ritual of the Oga peninsula.

On New Year’s Eve, they march along a street and make inhabitants go back to their homes. Then they visit houses door to door, scolding children who may be guilty of laziness or bad behavior.

One of the purposes is to advise children to obey their parents and to behave themselves.  They say  "Are there any crybabies around?" or "Are naughty kids around?" in the local dialect.  If parents want Namahage to encourage or tell off their children by giving a specific original way, parents can ask them in advance to give special lessons to their children.  It lasts until children heavily cry or leave their house.

Some researchers suggest that it relates to a belief in deities to take away bad luck and bring fortune for the new year. Meanwhile, others say it is an ancient agricultural custom.

Oga Peninsula’s one is the most famous and was designated as an important intangible folk cultural property by the country in 1978.  It was once carried out in most villages on the peninsula, but gradually decreased.  According to Oga City, nearly half of the town associations didn’t hold festivals in 2011.  Therefore, they established a subsidy system for the neighborhood association in the next year.  Its aim is to motivate people to implement Namahage, to inherit the tradition.

Nevertheless, only six local associations revived Namahage at the end of last year.  The biggest reason is the decrease in the number of young people who play the leading role.  So even 70s villagers are dressed up as Namahage.  Some citizens are concerned that the custom will inevitably be lost in the long run.

This year, because of covid-19, almost all associations decided to call off the festival. While one of them implemented the festival taking countermeasures to prevent infection. In Kobukata area, actors did neither enter houses nor eat any alcohol or dishes which were yearly served as hospitality.  One of the actors said “The most important thing is how to maintain the traditional culture to a new era."  Thanks to their efforts, they could manage to maintain the tradition and take measures at the same time.

Alexis Kennedy

Alexis Kennedy (born 1972) is a British video game developer and writer. He makes independent or 'indie' games. Indie games are not made by big companies, but small groups of people. He made the indie games company Failbetter Games in 2009, and was its CEO until 2016. In 2017, he made a new company called Weather Factory. Kennedy's games are known for being different to most video games. He refers to them as "weird" and "experimental", meaning they have new ideas and work differently to other games.

In 2009, Kennedy made a game called "Fallen London". "Fallen London" is set in a world where Victorian England was different to the real world. In the game, the city of London was taken down under the ground by strange bats and put in an underground world called the Neath, where it is always nighttime. "Fallen London" has been called a horror game. It has also been compared to Romanticism, a style of art from the 19th century about feelings, imagination, and freedom.

"Fallen London" is a browser game. People play browser games in their web browser, rather than downloading it on their computer or buying it from a store. In 2020, in a quote from his book "Sex, Lies, and Videogames" (which was not yet published), Kennedy said the game was meant to be a different kind of game like them. He wanted to do something different, but still be a browser game.

Many people liked "Fallen London". Gaming journalists gave it good reviews. Some of them liked it so much they gave it awards.

Because so many people liked "Fallen London", Kennedy and his company Failbetter Games decided to make a new game set in the Neath. The game, "Sunless Sea", came out in 2015.

"Sunless Sea" is set in the Unterzee, the name for the ocean in the Neath. The player plays a sea captain who sails (called 'zailing' in the game) the Unterzee. They might 'zail' to make money, to become famous, or for more personal reasons, such as in memory of their dead father. "Sunless Sea" is a computer role-playing game, but it also has some parts from other kinds of games. For instance, it has the roguelike traits that you need to make a new character if you die, and you need to keep track of your food and fuel.

Like "Fallen London", "Sunless Sea" was very well liked. It got the last perfect 10/10 rating from the video game magazine "Eurogamer". It also sold many copies. In 2018, Kennedy said it had sold 350,000 copies.

In 2016, Kennedy decided to leave Failbetter Games, the company he made "Fallen London" and "Sunless Sea" with. He made a new company, Weather Factory, to make new games. These games were not set in the Neath. However, they still had a lot in common with his old games.

The first game Weather Factory made was called "Cultist Simulator". It came out in 2018. The player character in "Cultist Simulator" is someone who studies the occult, which is secret spiritual ideas about the way the world works. They want to make a cult of followers who can help them become more powerful. They need to do this while making sure they do not die, go to prison, or go insane.

Like the other games, "Cultist Simulator" had good reviews. A lot of people compared it to stories by H.P. Lovecraft, a man who wrote strange stories about horror, madness, and cults.

Weather Factory is making another game called "Book of Hours" about an occult librarian. "Book of Hours" will come out in 2023.

When Kennedy started to make games, his ex-wife was pregnant and his daughter was going to be born. He decided to start making games because he was worried he wouldn't ever do it if he didn't start then. Before making games, he was a teacher. When Kennedy was a child, his father died, and when he was a young adult, his brother died. He has said these deaths are a part of why he writes the things he does.

In 2019, some people accused Kennedy of sexual harassment. They said he dated some women who worked at Failbetter Games, and that he was mean to those women and hurt them. Kennedy said that the people saying these things were wrong, and that they were hurting him.

Kirkbride decided to take an long break from the soap in autumn 2014. She last appeared on-screen on 8 October 2014. She died in January 2015, before she could return to work. Her character Deirdre was killed off and given a farewell storyline, with her "funeral" taking place on 13 July 2015.

Hilda Ogden

Hilda Ogden (also Crabtree) is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera "Coronation Street". She is one of the best-known regular characters in the serial. Her name became synonymous with a classic hard-working Northern working-class woman. She was played by Jean Alexander from 1964 to 1987. 

For much of her period as a character in the Street, Hilda worked as cleaner of The Rovers Return Inn. A gossip and busybody, many of her storylines were used for comedic purposes, though the character was equally used for dramatic effect; a scene in which she wept over the spectacles of her recently deceased husband Stan (Bernard Youens) has been hailed as one of the most moving images in television history.

Alexander quit the role of Hilda in 1987 after 23 years but was persuaded to reprise the part in 1990 for a one-off appearance as part of an ITV Telethon. She has also been seen in a spin-off video in 1998, in which another long-running character, Betty Williams (Betty Driver), visited her at her new home. Both of these appearances are considered canon to the show.

Arguably the serial's most popular character of all time, Hilda was voted the greatest TV character in a "Radio Times" poll of over 5,000 people. The typical appearance of Hilda, wearing hair curlers and a head scarf, has inspired art and catwalk themes.

Batch processing

Batch processing is when a number of tasks ("jobs") are put together over a set period of time. The jobs are then loaded into a computer system ("job queue") and done all at once, in a "batch." 
Once the batch processing starts, the user does not need to do anything else. This type of processing only works when there are timing constraints, i.e. files do not need to be updated immediately or a response from the computer is not needed right away.
One advantage of batch processing is that the computer can wait to process the batch until it is less busy. For example, it can do the jobs in the job queue overnight. Fields with batch processing include billing systems (e.g. electricity, gas, water and telephone), payroll systems and processing of bank cheques.

Children of Clione eat plankton and become carnivorous when they grow up a little. The food they eat is limited, and they only eat Limakina, who is the same companion and has a shell. Six tentacles come out from the head and capture the Limacina.  And it is a method of slowly absorbing the nutrients of the Limakina and eating it. They eat like a devil regardless of appearance.

Fertilization occurs 4 hours after copulation, and the female lays jelly-like eggs into the sea. The phytoplankton is breeding season at that time therefore, Clione's spawning season is off the coast of Vancouver in spring. The Sea of Okhotsk has a spawning season from late autumn to early summer.

It is reported that the number of eggs laid is approximately 150 to 200 in the small group with a body length of 1 cm and  approximately 1200 to 2800 in the large group with a body length of 4 to 8 cm.  And Clione matures in about one year and is said to have a life span of  two to three years.

They have white hips, tails and forearms, and reddish yellow faces. They have red and black stripes over their eyes. Male red-shanked doucs have white scrotums, red penises and white patches on their bottoms. This makes it easy for humans to tell male and female red-shanked doucs apart.

The red-shanked douc lives in Vietnam and Cambodia. They live as high as 2000 m (6600 feet) up in the mountains. They live in semi-deciduous forests and in primary and secondary rainforests. They live in the middle of to upper levels of the canopy.

Female red-shanked doucs are old enough to mate at 4 years. Male red-shanked doucs are old enough to mate at 4 or 5 years.

Red-shanked doucs display before mating. They drop their jaws, wave their eyebrows, and shake their heads at each other. Scientists say the female red-shanked douc always makes the first move. She lies down on a branch and looks over her shoulder at the male. Sometimes he comes to mate with her and sometimes he does not.

The red-shanked douc breeds from August to December, and gives birth to one offspring after a gestation period of 6 to 7 months. They are born with their eyes wide open and hang on to their mothers instinctively. Between 8 and 24 months of age, the color of the fur and face changes slowly. They have adult colors at 10 months.

Red-shanked doucs live in groups. They usually live in groups of 4 to 15 relatives. Each group has one or more male and about two females per male. The males tend to dominate over the females.

Red-shanked doucs cannot grasp things with their tails. They use their tails for balance instead. They use arms and legs to move through the forest. They follow the same routes. The adult males lead the group, the females and very young doucs are in the middle, and young males go last. When the doucs sense a predator or other danger, they flee very quietly through the trees. They spend most of their time eating, digesting their bulky food, sleeping and grooming each other's fur. They communicate with facial expressions and sounds. The low-pitch grow indicates threat, and short and hash distress squeal.

In 1910, 935 people were accommodated in this prison although the maximum capacity was 650 people. In 1922, Japan passed the Juvenile Law. The prison was renamed twice in 1922 and 1946.

The former Nara prison was renamed "the Nara Juvenile Prison" in 1946. Prisoners were between 16 and 26 years old. The prison had education programs so the prisoners would be less likely to commit more crimes after being released from prison. This was the first place in Japan to have a sexual offense recidivism prevention program.

The building has Romanesque architecture and was made of highly fireproof red brick. These bricks were made by prisoners. British stacking was used because it is easy to install and strong. A structure called a Haviland system, in which the prison buildings were spread out in a radial pattern around a watchtower, was used. This helped the guards see what was happening.

The Former Nara Prison stopped working a prison in March 2017 because the buildings were too old. Instead of being knocked down, the government decided to reopen it as a hotel in 2024. The hotel is to be called the Hoshino Resort, a major Japanese inn brand. The hotel was originally scheduled to open in 2021, but the COVID-19 pandemic meant it had to be done later.

Edward Leung

Edward Leung Tin Kei (; born 2 June 1991) is a Hong Kong politician and activist. He was a spokesperson of Hong Kong Indigenous. He claims Hong Kong independence and created the sentence "Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times" during the 2016 by-election. The sentence is later widely used in the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests.

In 2016, he became a candidate representing Hong Kong Indigenous in the Legislative Council by-election. In February 2016, he was arrested in the Mong Kok civil unrest. However, he still got over 66,000 votes, about 15% of the total votes. The Hong Kong government then requested future candidates to report their political position. Leung reported to give up its claim on independence. However, the officier still declined his candidacy.

In 2017, a documentary based on his story, "Lost in the Fumes", was released. In June 2018, he was sent to jail for 6 years for "rioting" and "assaulting a police officer".

In 2019, he became one of the people in the "100 Next" chosen by "Time" magazine.

When Leung was young, he asked the reasons for political events in Hong Kong, such as Handover of Hong Kong in 1997 and 1st July marches in 2003. He then started joining some political events in 2008, when he was 17. The first two being the memorials for the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and the 1st July marches. He was touched by people fighting for democracy. In Summer 2014, the government of People's Republic of China passed "831 decision" and White paper, making Leung not believe that the HKSAR government will follow Sino-British Joint Declaration.

In 2015, localist group Hong Kong Indigenous was set up to support small shops on the street. Leung then served as the spokeperson of the party.

In December 2015, he made the decision to join the 2016 New Territories East by-election so as to push localism forward and test his accepted rate, being a representative of Hong Kong Indigenous.

On 8 February 2020, Leung and people of Hong Kong Indigenous helped small shops on the street to move to Portland Street and called on social network to help when the officiers wanted to stop all the shops from working. At midnight, it turn into a civil unrest between protestors and police. Leung started a election parade so as to cover the protestors. Leung was then arrested together with 20 other members but Leung still got supports from some political organizations and activists such as Youngspiration, and Wong Yuk-man. Leung finally lost the by-election with 66,524 votes, 15.3% of the votes, behind Alvin Yeung and Holden Chow.

After the by-election, Leung made a decision to join the Legislative Council election in September in the same year. In July, Electoral Affairs Commission said that all candidates need to make statement to check if they support Basic Law. Leung, at the end, signed the statement but was still disqualified by the officiers.

On 18 December 2017, after Leung was charged rioting in Mong Kok unrest, Hong Kong Indigenous made a statement that Leung had resigned as the spokeperson of the party and his membership.

On 22 January 2018 on court, he admit assault charges but disagreed with rioting and inciting riot. Jurors met concensus that he was guilty of rioting and assault charges but not of inciting riot. He was sentenced to 6 years in prison.

During jail time, Leung wrote to seek appeal and legal help. He also studied a Bachelor of Social Science in the Open University of Hong Kong during jail time. The appeal got international supports. However, on 29 April 2020, the appeal was rejected.

On 19 January 2022, Leung was released from prison. He also said on Facebook that he would stop using social media.

Kanglatongbi

Kanglatongbi is a small town in the Imphal West district of the Indian state of Manipur. As of 2011, the total population is 7,152. The average high temperature in Kanglatongbi is 24.3°C (75.7°F) and an average low-temperature of 6.3°C (43.4°F), with January as the coldest month.

It is also known as the “Normandy of the East”. In 1942, Burma (Myanmar) was seized by the Japanese Army after defeating the Commonwealth troops. They placed their forces in Burma, making it their base for the attack on Imphal and Assam to hold the Chinese air forces across the Himalayas. 

At Kanglatongbi, the unstable positions of the 221 AOD corps blocked the advance of Japanese troops. The situation of 221 AOD was risky and exposed to attacks from all directions. Its defense relied heavily on the courage and bravery of its soldiers.

After the battle in Burma, the British armed force moved to Imphal as they found it most practical. The British improved the defenses at Imphal as the 23rd Indian Division positioned in Manipur is prepared and new air runways were developed. In late 1944, the Commonwealth armed forces received additional armies and air force units, effectively improving their military capabilities. Thus, the general hospital became essential in providing primary healthcare services to support the growing armed forces. 

In the spring of 1944, recognizing the importance of Imphal, Japanese forces launched an attack in Manipur. They bombed Imphal, cut a section of the Imphal-Dimapur road, and continued their attack on Imphal for several months. The Fourteenth Army of the Commonwealth Forces fiercely fought back, blocking the Japanese advance. The siege of Imphal finally ended on June 22, 1944, when British and Indian soldiers from Kohima and Imphal met at Milestone 109. The Japanese forces suffered heavy losses, with nearly 50,000 of their soldiers died in the rough terrain and situation of the area.

During the Second World War in the capitals of Kohima and Imphal in India, it is estimated that 65,000 Japanese soldiers died. On the British side, around 17,000 soldiers were killed or injured, while the Allies suffered a total of 12,603 casualties. 

In their failed attempt to defeat the Allied forces at Imphal and invade India, the Japanese forces were pushed back into Burma. Lt. Gen. Renya Mutaguchi dismissed many division commanders during the battle. As a result, both Lt. Gen. Renya Mutaguchi and Lt. Gen. Musaku Kawabe were removed from their command. 

It is considered one of the most decisive and harshest battles of World War II. As the Japanese soldiers retreated, they experienced many problems, including hunger, disease, and exhaustion, which caused a lot of deaths in their troops. This battle is a major turning point and led to further retreat of the Japanese forces.

This tradition was tied to the practice of sacrificing animals during the Durga Puja festival, observed by Hindus. However, with growing concerns for animal welfare and rights in India, the practice has been stopped by the village elders. The winning team receives trophies and cash prizes instead. Despite the change, the tournament has retained its original name "Khasi," as it has gained popularity and the majority of villagers are content with referring to it as the "Khasi Tournament."

Sexual capital

Sexual capital (or erotic capital) is the social value an individual or social group gets as a function of their sexual attractiveness. Like other forms of economic capital, sexual capital can be converted to other forms of capital. Sexual capital can be useful in getting social or economic capital. British sociologist Catherine Hakim first used the term "erotic capital", in the early 2000s. French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu had already defined other forms of capital, such as economic, cultural, or social capital. Hakim saw sexual capital as different. She says erotic capital is independent of class origin; for this reason, it enables social mobility. Hakim argues that this makes erotic capital socially subversive, which results in the prevailing power structures devaluing and trying to suppress it. In the manosphere, the parallel term "sexual market value" or its abbreviation "SMV" is often used.

Nobel prize winner Gary Becker developed a theory of human capital. In 1972, Michael Grossmann had developed the term "health capital". Robert Michael extended this term to include sexual capital. Maichal says, if an individual choses to use his or her sexual attractivness, this is a rational choice, and the individual will expect something in return.

Air fryer

An air fryer is a small convection oven. It is used as an alternative to deep frying to fry food without using so much oil.

Air fryers usually have a removable cooking basket or tray where you place the food. Air frying differs from traditional baking because normal ovens use gas or electricity to produce heat. Air Fryers use rapid air technology to create heat. This makes the process quicker than normal convection ovens.

Air fryers cook food that would normally be cooked in oil. The air fryer's cooking chamber radiates heat from a heating element near the food. A fan then moves the hot air around the food. The temperature in an air fryer varies depending on the model, but the heating chamber of a typical commercial air fryer can reach 250 degrees Celsius (482 degrees Fahrenheit). 

Air fryers have become a useful kitchen appliance. With them people can make many different foods. These includes crispy French fries and chicken wings. This is done with about 80 percent less oil than deep frying.

There are several types of air fryers that are on the market today for household use.

In this type, a paddle machine moves throughout the heating chamber to move the air around more evenly. This is more convenient for the user because other types of air fryers require manual stirring throughout to ensure that all sides are fully cooked. 

A cylindrical basket is a small, single function air fryer that includes a drawer with a removable basket. A fan circulates from the top, and the food is cooked through holes in the basket. It can accommodate three quarts (2.8 liters) of food or less on average. Because of its compact size, it preheats faster than other types of air fryers.

Countertop Convention ovens come with an air frying feature that work the same way as basket type air fryers. They usually have multiple trays or racks, so multiple things can be cooked at the same time. It holds twenty-five quarts (23.7 liters) of food on average. They are more versatile than single function type because they have multiple features like baking, rotisserie, grilling, frying, broiling, and toasting. 

This type of air fryer cooks food with a halogen light from above. The heat is spread evenly throughout with a fan like other types of air fryers. This type usually looks like a large glass bowl with a hinged lid because the clear glass works as an easy and fast heat conductor. ￼ 

These are large, barrel shaped air fryers used to cook whole turkeys and other large amount of meat. It circulates air around the drum to cook the turkey evenly.

In 1944, William Maxson partnered with the United States Navy to prepare frozen meals on passenger planes. His "Sky Plate" cooked up to six meals at the same time and weighed 35 pounds. His design used convection oven technology to circulate hot air around the food. He patented his design in 1949.

Fred van der Weij, an inventor from Netherlands, started developing the modern air fryer in 2005 building on William Maxson's invention. He took three years to develop a prototype, and his egg-shaped fryer, produced by Philips, was introduced in 2010 at the IFA Berlin (Internationale Funkausstellung), a major consumer electronics fair in Berlin.
