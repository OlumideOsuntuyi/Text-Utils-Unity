Novy Chas

Novy Chas (, New Time in English) is a private newspaper from Belarus. It comes every week. It writes about society and politics in the Belarusian language. 
The government has been making troubles for "Novy Chas" all the time. Shortly after its start, "Novy Chas" was stopped to be printed. The newspaper was warned by the government of Belarus at the end of 2007. In June 2010, the paper was also warned by the Ministry of Information. Then it was took away from stores run by the government.

It has been writing about the 2020 Belarusian protests and 2020 Belarusian presidential election, so several journalists of "Novy Chas" have been tried and arrested for that.

Since February 2021, the newspaper is taken away from stores run by the government again.

On May 28, 2021, the Deputy Prosecutor General of Belarus Maksim Voronin made a warning to the editor-in-chief of "Novy Chas". The official did not like three stories printed in the newspaper in February and April 2021. The warning was written in Russian and had some citations from these Belarusian stories. Their translation from the Belarusian language into the Russian language was wrong, though. On June 7, 2021, Belposhta (Belpost (), Belarusian postal service) said no to making an agreement on using its subscription services for the second half of 2021 to the office of "Novy Chas".

On August 10, 2021, it became known that there will be no newspaper in the print form after August 12. The private printing house "Roll Print" wrote a letter about it on July 27. The printing house ran into troubles in the process of printing, so it became not possible to stick to the agreement on printing, it said. "Novy Chas" tried to find a new printing house but did not make it. "Novy Chas" promised that its website and social network services would be kept going.

On October 19–20, 2021, the "Novy Chas" office and the houses of its journalist were looked for. The people were interrogated. Computers and other things were taken away. The European Federation of Journalists, the International Federation of Journalists, the Belarusian Association of Journalists said bad words on that.

On October 28, 2021, the domain name of "Novy Chas" novychas.by was stopped working in Belarus and other countries of the world. As a result, its journalists had to make another website of "Novy Chas". It is novychas.online.

In January 2024, it became known that the website and Internet pages of Novy Chas were banned in Belarus. Earlier in 2023, the newspaper's Telegram channel, its Odnoklassniki group, Instagram page and TikTok account were banned as well.

Mongba Hanba

Mongba Hanba () or Mongpa Hanpa () is a forest god in Meitei mythology and religion. He is mainly worshipped in a sacred forest named "Mongba Hanba Umang" in the banks of the Imphal River in Manipur.

On Saturday, the 16th day of the Meitei lunar month of "Inga" of 1651 Saka Year (1729 AD), a stone was brought from a marketplace in Langmaiching to Mongba Hanba's place. That stone was to make a statue of Hindu God Hanuman. Nine Umang Lais were brought and gathered at the Mongba Hanba's place. All these were buried in the place during the reign of King Garib Niwaj Pamheiba. So, the cult of God Mongba Hanba was replaced by that of Hindu god Hanuman during the reign of King Garib Niwaj Pamheiba.

On 6th June 1979, an association was formed for saving Mongba Hanba Umang. It struggled for controlling the Laipham (English: Sacred place) for worshipping the traditional deity. There have been repeated attempts to revive the pantheon of the deity. However, there is still opposition from the religious body of the Mahabali Temple of Hindu God Hanuman.

During May 2015, an organization named "Mongba Hanba Umang Laipham Kanba Lup" appealed not to stop them from constructing a place of worship for God Mongba Hanba. The organization claimed that it had not stopped devotees of God Mahabali (Hanuman) for the last 36 years. The organization expected the same thing from the Hindu bodies not to stop them from establishing a place of worship for God Mongba Hanba in the complex.

According to religious custom, Tampak Maiba was to worship God Mongba Hanba (). The atmosphere of blood sacrifice is said to be associated with the shrine of the deity.

Hedonic adaptation

Hedonic adaptation is the idea that humans get used to good and bad events over time. 

Good and bad events change happiness in the moment, but people get used to them. This is called adaptation. Because of adaptation, happiness usually stays the same over time. 

Hedonic adaptation is also called the hedonic treadmill. Looking for good events will only make a person adapt to them, leading them to want more. 

Hedonic adaption was developed in 1971. Scientists found that lottery winners were not happier than those who did not win. Also, those who could not walk were not much less happy than those who could. 

Newer studies show the same. For example, a 15-year-long study shows that married people in Germany were much more happy after marriage, but only for a short period of time. By the second year, their happiness was the same as before they got married. 

These studies show that it may not be possible to increase happiness for a long period of time. 

Hedonic adaptation contains two important ideas. First, how people feel about an event depends on how they feel before it happened. This means that good events make people happy in the moment. But over time, because they are already happy, their happiness does not change. Second, happiness usually returns to a point that stays the same. This is how people get used to events over time. 

Scientists thought that happiness returns to a neutral point: where a person is not happy nor sad. However, new studies show that most people are happy most of the time. So, happiness returns to a point where the person is happy. This point is different for everyone. How happy a person is may depend on personality: how a person usually acts and feels. This can come from their parents. 

Hedonic adaptation comes from cognitive changes: changes in how a person thinks. These changes are what a person likes and wants, and what they do and do not think about. Thinking about an event less is the main way adaptation happens. 

Hedonic adaptation also comes from neurochemical changes: changes in the brain that make good and bad feelings less strong. 

However, people do not get used to all events. Most studies show that people usually adapt to good events quickly and completely. Their happiness returns to exactly where it was before the event soon after the it happens. However, some strong or long-lasting bad events, such as losing a job or partner, result in less adaptation. Happiness may not completely return to its point before the event. In some situations, it may decrease. 

From an evolutionary position, hedonic adaptation is useful. It helps control the effects of bad events. It makes bad events less strong. This protects people from difficult situations and helps them survive in the present. 

Some effects of bad events are helpful. They tell us what is important. For example, hunger, thirst and pain. Other effects can be dangerous. Long periods of fear and worry for example, can harm the body and the mind, leading to disease and illness. 

Hedonic adaptation is a part of the “psychological immune system”. It protects people from dangers to their health. This often happens unconsciously, without the person knowing. 

Hedonic adaptation can change the way people see their situation. As bad events become less strong, people are more likely to make changes to better the situation. 

For example, the death of a partner can make people very sad. They see no way to make the situation better. However, adaptation helps people see what can be changed. They may try to prevent a similar event from happening. This helps people learn from past events to survive in the present. 

Good events make people happy in the moment. But not for long. People look for other things to stay happy. People get used to them too. This treadmill effect means that the more a person gets, the more they want. This makes staying happy hard. 

A person who is not used to an event often thinks it is more important than it really is. For example, healthy people think unhealthy people are less happy than they really are. People who are not used an event can think jobs, marriage, and where they live will affect their happiness more than it really will. 

Being used to an event may change what people think is right and wrong. For example, people in the Milgram experiment were asked to harm another person multiple times. Each time was more harmful than the last. When people become used to harming others, they may no longer think that it is wrong. 

There are ways to prevent hedonic adaptation. For example, the Hedonic Adaptation Prevention Model (HAP) says that variety and appreciation can make happiness last. 

Variety is when happiness comes at a surprise even after the event has happened. The surprise makes getting used to the event difficult. This keeps happiness high. It also stops people from wanting more. 

Appreciation is when a person is happy with what they have. They know that they may lose it. This is the opposite of adaptation. By being appreciative, people are reminded of the good event. Thinking about it makes happiness continue. 

Giving something up and getting it back can also prevent hedonic adaptation and make happiness last. 

Hedonic adaptation says that happiness returns to a single point. However, happiness comes from many things. Change in one area of happiness, such as at work, does not always mean change in another area of happiness, such as in marriage. Different areas of happiness can change in different ways and at different times. The point where happiness returns to after an event may be different depending on which area of happiness is affected. 

Hedonic adaptation says it may not be possible to increase happiness for a long period of time. People will always get used to good events. However, a 17-year-long study found that 24% of people said their happiness changed a lot between the first and last five years. 

Another study found that differences in happiness can be explained by how much freedom or money countries have. They last for a long time. The difference in happiness shows that people do not completely adapt to some events. For example, a study shows that people adapt to money, but not status: how others see them.

Conformity

Conformity is when someone changes their behaviour to match that of other people.

It can happen for personal and social reasons. Personally, people conform because they have expectations for themselves. They might believe that behaving a certain way will help them reach a goal. Conformity can also happen because of other people’s influence. People will conform to be liked or to be a part of a group. 

Conformity happens in different levels. Furthermore, the reasons that someone conforms for and what they hope to get out of it, are often linked. Growing up, children learn by copying the behaviours of others. They rely on other’s opinions to be true or on their behaviour to be appropriate. Furthermore, the size of the group matters when conforming.

People conform for normative and informational reasons. Additionally, there is a difference between compliance, identification and internalization. 

There is much research on conformity. Two of the most famous conformity experiments are those by Sherif (1935) and by Asch (1955). 

Sherif (1935) studied how people behave in an unclear situation. In his experiment, participants guessed how far a small point of light on a black screen is moving. This point of light didn’t actually move. It was an optical illusion. First, the participants had to make guesses on their own. Then, they were put into groups of three. There, they changed their answers to fit those of the other two participants better. The researchers made sure that two participants with rather high guesses were put together with a participant with a rather low guess. After, this participant changed his answer to be more similar to the ones of the others. The researchers suggested that this is a sign for conformity. Afterwards, the participants had to make a guess on their own again. There, the answers of their group members from before influenced them, because their guesses were similar to what they had guessed in the group situation. Because of the unclear situation, participants looked at what others were doing. Therefore, they changed their answers to conform to the group.

Researchers criticised Sherif’s study. Because participants had to guess the movement of a point of light that was not actually moving. This meant that there was no right or wrong answer. Being so unsure maybe made participants to conform. 

Asch (1955) wanted to find out if people conformed to other people even if the answer to a question was clear. In his experiment, he showed participants an image of a line. At the same time, he showed them another image with three lines of different lengths. The participants had to choose which line was the same length as the “standard” one, in the first image. 

A control trial showed the task was rather easy. There, the participants made almost no mistakes in matching the correct lines. However, in the main part of the experiment, all except for one participant were confederates. This means that the researcher had told them how to behave during the experiment. They were told to give wrong answers to see how the other participant reacts. The other participant, however, believed that everyone else was also a participant like him. 

The confederates and the participants formed groups of 7 to 9 students. Furthermore, they were asked to match the correct lines 12 times (12 trials). Three-fourths of participants gave the same, wrong answer as the confederates in at least one trial. All in all, participants conformed to the others on an average of 36.8% of the time. These results suggest that more than 3 out of 10 times, the participant was not giving the correct answer, probably in order to conform. 

Deutsch and Gerard (1955) found that people conform for normative and informational reasons.

Normative social influence is when someone changes their behaviour to meet expectations. These can be their own expectations for themselves or the expectations others have for them. The influence will be bigger between people in a group than between two people, for example. Furthermore, the normative influence is smaller when someone feels that there is no need for them to conform. Additionally, not conforming to these expectations can make someone feel scared or guilty. For example, a small child might laugh with their family even if they cannot understand the joke yet. 

Informational social influence is when someone accepts information from others as the truth. The more unsure someone is, the more likely they are to consider other’s opinions as right. For example, a child might accept whatever new information it is taught by their parents as the truth. 

These two types of conformity can work together. In Asch’s (1955) experiment, for example, a participant might be confused because his answer is different from the confederates’ answers. He might feel like he has to normatively conform to the group so that he will not be the only one to stand out. Moreover, he might usually trust his eyes, but this time ask himself if there might be something wrong with his vision. This might lead him to conform to the others informationally because he accepts their answers as right and does not want to be wrong. 

Kelman et al (1958) found different three forms of conformity.

Compliance is when someone conforms because they hope for a positive reaction from others. The person changes their behaviour not necessarily because they agree with it. As a consequence, people who comply might only conform when certain people are present. In sum, compliance is conforming to others “on the outside”, while maybe not agreeing with them “on the inside”. They do it with the hope of a social effect. For example, a child might sit still during a church service to comply and meet its family’s expectations. In reality, the child might prefer playing outside with the other kids. 

Identification is when someone changes their behaviour because they want to make their relationship to another person our group better. They conform in situations that are important for the relationship. For example, someone might change their behaviour whenever their older cousin visits. 

Internalization is when someone changes their behaviour because of the content of the behaviour they conform to. They already agree with the values the behaviour stands for and maybe even find it practical. People conform whenever suitable. They do not care who is present or whether it is needed to conform. For example, when someone cares for nature with internalization, they might never leave plastic waste anywhere, no matter who is watching them or where in nature they are.

Sandrembi Chaisra

"Sandrembi Chaisra", also known as "Sanarembi Chaisra", is a folktale of the Meitei ethnicity of Ancient Manipur (Antique Kangleipak). It is a story of the two stepsisters, Sandrembi, the elder and Chaisra, the younger, born to the same father but from different mothers. The protagonist is Sandrembi, a young lady, living in forsaken environment, that are changed into a remarkable fortune.

She is considered to be a person having the nature of God like mind.

The folk legend is considered a perfect combination of the ""Cinderella"" and ""The Three Oranges"".

In the Haya Chak Era, when King Sentreng Apanba reigned in Antique Kangleipak (Ancient Manipur), he had a nobleman named Khulen Nganba who had two wives, the senior named Yangkhuleima (Yangkhureima, Yaibireima or Yaipileima) and the junior named Sangkhuleima (Sankhureima). By the grace of God, the elder one had a daughter named Sandrembi (Sanarembi) ("and also boy" in another version) and the younger one had only one daughter named Chaisra (Cheisra). The father died after sometime. The two widows used to go to market for selling vegetables and go to Shilempat (Shilem lake) to catch fish for livelihood. Sangkhuleima, the younger widow always thought of ways to harm Yangkhuleima, the elder one. One day, it so happened that Yangkhuleima (the elder) caught all types of fish but Sangkhuleima (the younger) caught some snakes and reptiles and not a single fish. Both of them took rest under a fig tree. She grew envious of the fate of the elder one and climbed up the fig tree for plucking the fruits. Once or twice she dropped the fig fruits to the elder one who partook of the juice. At last, the latter was made to close her eyes and open her mouth to swallow the most delicious fruit. Then she poured the snakes from her fish basket. The poor woman swallowed them and died on account of snake bite. Sangkhuleima came down and pushed the dead body of Yangkhuleima into the deep water of the lake. It got transformed into a tortoise (or turtle). Everybody was shocked to hear from Sangkhuleima, the younger co-wife, about news of the tragic death of Yangkhuleima, the elder widow by drowning. In another version of the story, Sangkhuleima told others that stubborn Yangkhuleima didn't want to return home and insisted on staying to catch fish until sunset.

The younger widow and her daughter Chaisra (Cheisra) began to maltreat lovely Sandrembi (Shanarembi). One night, Yangkhuleima appeared in the dream of her daughter, Sandrembi, and revealed the crime committed by the stepmother. She further instructed Sandrembi to bring her (tortoise form) from the lake and keep her in a pitcher for five days without any break so that she may re-assume human form. Sandrembi did so but before the completion of the five days, Chaisra, the younger step sister, got the knowledge of the tortoise and so, she pretended to be ill in her bed. When Yangkhuleima, her mother came to her, she said that tortoise meat would cure her. "Get that tortoise which Sandrembi had caught from the lake. Boil it for cooking." The stepmother forced poor Sandrembi to boil the tortoise. Sandrembi tried to take away the fuel stick (on hearing the tortoise mother's words from the boiling pan/pot) but she could not save her mother (tortoise) before them.

Chaisra and her mother devoured the tortoise meat to their heart's content and threw away the bones in the verandah. Again Yangkhuleima, the tortoise mother told Sandrembi in her dream to keep the bones of tortoise in a basket after covering it by a piece of cloth and it must not be opened for 7 days. Sandrembi did so. However, before the completion of the said period, out of her anxiety as well as curiosity, she opened the basket and thereby disturbing the normal process of coming to human shape. The tortoise mother assumed the shape of a sparrow and flew away. Both stepsisters grew up in course of time. Sandrembi, the elder, was beautiful and accomplished but not nicely dressed up. Chaisra, the younger, was ugly although properly dressed. Once the King ("Crown Prince" in another version) went for hunting with a large retinue, horses and elephants. The king saw the two maidens by a riverside. Realising the quality of Sandrembi, the elder, the king made her the chief Queen after a ceremonial marriage. She spent her life with her brother in a joyous mood. A son was also born to her, the boy was named Machi Sana Melei Khomba in Meitei sacred lores. Sangkhuleima, the stepmother and Chaisra, the step sister gnashed their teeth in anger and were planning to kill the Queen. They invited her for a dinner in their house. Sandrembi came
to her stepmother's house with permission of the King. After the dinner, Chaisra, the younger, out of jealousy, dropped the Queen's dress under a bed ("in a hole" in another version). When Sandrembi went down to bring it up, the wicked stepmother poured the hottest water over Queen Sandrembi's body. Poor Queen got transformed into a pigeon and flew away. Chaisra, in the Queen's dress, went to the palace and behaved as if she was the real queen. The suspected king told her in anger, "You are not my queen whose face is as fair as the lily. You are disfigured." Chaisra replied that she contracted mental and physical agony when she wept for her son. The king again continued, "You are not my queen for your nose is too long, your eyes are very deep and the hairs of the eyelids are bushy." Chaisra replied, "I missed you so much, I cried rubbing my eyes all the way." In spite of his suspicion, the King wanted suitable opportunity in order to detect the false queen. In the meantime, the pigeon flew into the Royal Garden, perched on a tree branch and addressed to the Royal Gardener ("grass cutter" in another version) concerning the forgetfulness of the King about Queen Sandrembi, animal epidemic, grievances of the Prince and loss of his own sickle along with a warning for reporting these words to the king. The king on getting the report went in search of the pigeon with grains of paddy in his hands. The King kept the supernatural bird in his palace. Even as a bird, she took away the dirty things from the Prince's eyes. Chaisra killed the bird with a stick and prepared a nice meal for the King. The king refused to taste the flesh of the pet bird and threw it away and buried it behind the Royal Kitchen. But it was the age of the truth and there grew a lucious fruit plant and it bore full of fruits overnight ("only one fruit" in another version). A big lucious fruit also came from the plant. Chaisra, the false queen gave the lucious fruit as a gift to a monk ("servant" in another version). The man kept the fruit in a jar in his house since the same was not yet ripe enough to be eaten. Later it so happened to him that fruit disappeared when the knife was available and vice versa. Early next morning, he went out for work. Returning home, he was surprised to find that his cottage had been washed and the meal cooked. He kept the mystery concealed for some days and was determined to solve it by all means. Long before the first streak of day light came, he got up and had gone some distance secretly in the darkness and entered the cottage silently and peeped into his own room. At Sunrise, he saw a beautiful woman coming out of the jar and roaming in kitchen for house work. "It is a fruit maiden", he muttered. Recognising her as the Queen, he took her to the king. There was a quarrel between Sandrembi and Chaisra, the two step sisters on the issue of the identity of the real Queen. The obstinate Chaisra denied the whole story and called Sandrembi to be a "fruit maiden".

At long last, the king decided to settle the case by appealing to a divine ordeal. The two had to fight a duel with swords. As per the code, the defendant was allowed to use a bright and sharp sword but the plaintiff (Sandrembi) had to use a rusty knife ("wooden knife" in another version) for on her part laid the burden of proof. It was thought that if justice was really on her, she would win inspite of using a rusty sword. Chaisra had no belief in the trial by ordeal and was hopeful that she would be able to kill her rival with one stroke. Her demand for use of the bright sword was a legitimate one. The blunt and rusty sword (or "wooden sword") was given to Sandrembi for she had to prove her own case. Sandrembi, the elder had the faith in her, "If I am innocent, may Chaisra's sword become harmless to me." In the arena, while Chaisra hewed and hacked at her with the sword, Sandrembi remained unhurt. Suddenly, the blunt sword of its own accord, slipped out of Sandrembi's hand and chopped off Chaisra's neck. In another version of the story, there was no fighting between them. Sandrembi, the elder pardoned Chaisra, the younger. Both of them lived together as chief queen and younger queen respectively in great happiness.

Snowmelt

Snowmelt is water from snow that melts. There is a lot of snowmelt in the spring. Snowmelt can cause floods.

Snowmelt can also affect how good and safe drinking water is. Snowflakes collect air pollution as they fall. Snow on the ground collects pollution from cars, farm animals, fertilizer, and other things. The snowmelt collects dirt and other pollutants on the ground. Pollution in snowmelt can be a larger problem than pollution in rainwater because the snow collects pollution all winter and then the snowmelt combines with the spring rain and releases it all at the same time. Then it flows into streams and reservoirs where human beings get their drinking water.

Jamshid

Jamshid () (, "Jamshīd") (Middle- and New Persian: جم, "Jam") (Avestan: 𐬫𐬌𐬨𐬀 "Yima") (Dari/Pashto: یما "Yama") is a famous name in many countries and he was the fourth Shah of the mythological Pishdadian dynasty of Iran according to "Shahnameh".

In Persian mythology and folklore, Jamshid is described as the fourth and greatest king of the ancient Iran Pishdadian Dynasty . This role is already alluded to in Zoroastrian scripture (e.g. "Yasht" 19, "Vendidad" 2), where the figure appears as Yima(-Kshaeta)

"Jamshid" (Jamshed, Jamshyd) and as a short pronunciation Jam remains a common Iranian and Zoroastrian male name that is also popular in surrounding areas of Iran and middle east.

The name "Jamshid" is originally a compound of two parts, "Jam" and "shid", corresponding to the Avestan names "Yima" and "Xšaēta", "*Xšaitah" meant "bright, shining" or "radiant". The modern Turkish name "Cem" is derived from Persian "Jam". also the word Ajam is derived from the word Jam. according to the book Documents on the Persian Gulf's name the Persian "jam" is the root of Arabic "Ajam", assuming that this Arabic word for the Persian-speaking population was derived from a Persian endonym, meaning the people of Jam. 
Source:

Yima rules as king for three hundred years, and soon the earth was full of men, flocks of birds and herds of animals. He deprived the "daevas", who were demonic servants of the evil Ahriman, of wealth, herds and reputation during his reign. Good men, however, lived lives of plenty, and were neither sick nor aged. Father and son walked together, each appearing no older than fifteen. Ahura Mazda visits him once more, warning him of this overpopulation. Yima, shining with light, faced southwards and pressed the golden seal against the earth and boring into it with the poniard, says "O Spenta Armaiti, kindly open asunder and stretch thyself afar, to bear flocks and herds and men."

Over time, the Avestan hero "Yima Xšaēta" became the world-ruling Shāh "Jamshid" of Persian legend and mythology.

According to the "Shāhnāma" of the poet Firdausī, Jamshid was the fourth king of the world. He had command over all the angels and demons of the world, and was both king and high priest of Hormozd . He was responsible for a great many inventions that made life more secure for his people: the manufacture of armor and weapons, the weaving and dyeing of clothes of linen, silk and wool, the building of houses of brick, the mining of jewels and precious metals, the making of perfumes and wine, the art of medicine, the navigation of the waters of the world in sailing ships. 
Jamshid had now become the greatest monarch the world had ever known. Jamshid was said to have had a magical seven-ringed cup, the "Jām-e Jam" which was filled with the elixir of immortality and allowed him to observe the universe.

Jamshid's capital was erroneously believed to be at the site of the ruins of Persepolis, which for centuries (down to 1620 CE) was called "Takht-i Jamshēd", the "Throne of Jamshid".
However, Persepolis was actually the capital of the Achaemenid kings and was destroyed by Alexander. Similarly, the sculptured tombs of the Achaemenids and Sāsānians near Persepolis were believed to be images of the legendary hero Rostam, and so were called "Naqsh-e Rustam".

King Jamshid is featured prominently in one apocryphal tale associated with the history of wine and its discovery.

Uchek Langmeidong

Uchek Langmeidong () or Chekla Langmeidong () is a Meitei folktale of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). It is the story of a girl named "Hayainu" (alias "Nongdam Atombi") who turned herself into a "Langmeidong" (, hornbill bird) as she was unable to suffer with the ill treatments of her stepmother.
In Meitei language (Manipuri language), "Uchek" (ꯎꯆꯦꯛ, /u.cek/) means "bird". "Langmeiton" (ꯂꯥꯡꯃꯩꯇꯣꯟ, /laŋ.məi.ton/)(or "Langmeidong" or "Langmeitong") is the Meitei language word for any species of (Hornbill). Chekla (ꯆꯦꯛꯂꯥ, /cek.la/) is another Meitei language word for "bird". The term "Chekla" is not commonly used in everyday speech.

Hayainu's mother had died when Hayainu was a young girl. Hayainu's father married again. So, Hayainu lived with her father, stepmother, and stepbrother ("stepbrother" is absent in some versions of the story). Her father loved her but her stepmother hated her. Hayainu’s father moved across the country to earn more money for his family. So, he left Hayainu under the care of his second wife (her stepmother). Just after her father had left her, her stepmother asked her to do all the household works. Hayainu had to collect herbs and had to catch fish daily. She had to sell them in the market. Hayainu served her stepmother faithfully but in return to her obedience, she was hated and would be beaten up by her cruel stepmother every day. Her stepmother’s ill treatment of her increased day by day. In some cases, her stepmother locked Hayainu up inside a room without giving any foods. One day, while Hayainu and her friends were washing their hairs with chenghi (traditional Meitei shampoo), her stepmother saw some cows grazing in their field. Her stepmother got angry thinking Hayainu got careless of the fields. So, Hayainu was badly beaten up. In another case, once Hayainu’s friends invited Hayainu to join a festival that was to be celebrated on the next day. At first, Hayainu was reluctant to join but later, she agreed. Her stepmother got to know about Hayainu's wish to celebrate the festival. On the early morning of the festival day, Hayainu’s stepmother had gone to her parental home with her son (Hayainu's stepbrother), taking away all the luxurious clothes and jewelry of Hayainu. When her stepmother and stepbrother had left the house, Hayainu later realised that trick. She had nothing to do but to weep. So, she did not go to the festival. With the increase of her stepmother’s cruelty, tears became Hayainu's companions in life. Once in Hayainu's dream, her real mother told her to go to the world of the "Langmeidong"s (Hornbills). In that dream, her mother suggested her to ask a flock of "Langmeidong"s coming near a lake every day to give her some of their feathers, collect and stitch them to her body and flew away. Hayainu woke up. She went to the spot and requested the birds for some of their feathers so that she could get a basketful of them. The birds fell pity on her and agreed. Once she got the feathers full of a basket, she wrapped some clothes around herself. Then, she sewed the feathers into the wrapped clothes. While she was doing that, her stepbrother saw her. Her stepbrother asked her not to leave him. She was explaining the reasons why she was doing so. Meanwhile, she completed her sewing. At that time, the same flock of hornbills were flying by. Hayainu called out to them requesting them to lift her up into the air. The birds picked her up and she flew away with them. Her stepbrother ran to his mother and narrated the whole story. Her stepmother was pleased with the news of Hayainu's departure. Some time passed, Hayainu’s father returned home. Seeing Hayainu absent, he asked his wife about his daughter. She did not reply but their son told him everything that had happened. Hayainu's father became angry and drove the stepmother out of the house. In another version of the story, Hayainu's father just beat his wife but did not drove her out of the house. Hayainu’s father was shocked by the news. He worried about his lovely daughter so much. So, he went out into the fields and called out to her to come back. Every day, he called her until one day he saw her coming with a flock of hornbills. Immediately, he took out a plate of rice and asked her to come and eat with him. Hayainu denied her father's offer telling him that she was then a part of the hornbill’s world (bird life) and she could not mingle up with the human beings again. Saying that, she flew away with her flock.
In 2010, the folktale of Uchek Langmeidong was produced in the form of a comic book, in Meitei (Manipuri) but in Latin script. It was authored by Subadani Ksh.

In 2011, the folktale of Uchek Langmeidong was produced in the form of a comic book, with the name, "Chekla Langmeitong". Interestingly, it came out to be the first comic book in Meetei script.

The folk story was reproduced into a play, ""Uchek Langmeidong (The Chorus of the Birds)"", by Ratan Thiyam, a legendary drama director of Manipur.
With the production of the play, the Chorus Repertory received recognition from the critics, presented at the 1979 Shri Ram Centre National Drama Festival.

In 2008, ""Uchek Langmeidong"", an animation feature film, was produced, based on the folktale.

In 2016, the folk legend was once more recreated into its theatrical form, performed by the child actors.

Pelasgians

Pelasgians (, "Pelasgós") was a name used by ancient Greek authors to describe the ancestors of Greek people. The name was also used to describe all the indigenous peoples of the Aegean Sea and their cultures.

The Pelasgians are mentioned many times in the "Histories" written by the Greek historian Herodotus. They are mentioned in the first volume of the "Histories" when Croesus wanted to learn who the strongest Greeks were to befriend them. Herodotus called the Pelasgian language "barbarian" but thought of the Pelasgians to have been Greek. Herodotus also wrote about different places where Pelasgians, or Pelasgian-speakers, lived as neighbors of the Dorians and the Athenians.

Herodotus also wrote about the relationship between the Pelasgians and the (other) Greeks. The relationship mirrored the "rivalry within Greece itself between [...] Dorian Sparta and Ionian Athens." Herodotus wrote that the Hellenes split from the Pelasgians with the former outnumbering the latter. 

In the second volume of the "Histories", Herodotus wrote that the Pelasgians called their gods "theoi" before naming them because the gods put things in order ("thentes"). The historian also wrote that the gods of the Pelasgians were the "Cabeiri" and that all of Greece, or Hellas, was first called "Pelasgia".

In the seventh volume of the "Histories", Herodotus wrote that the Aeolians were known anciently as "Pelasgians". 

In the eigth volume of the "Histories", Herodotus wrote that the Pelasgians of Athens were once called "Cranai".

The Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus gave a summary of the Pelasgians in his work "Roman Antiquities". He concluded based on the sources available to him that the Pelasgians were Greeks originally from the Peloponnese.

According to Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, the Pelasgians spoke Greek because the places where the "Pelasgi" traditionally lived, like Arcadia and Attica, only spoke Greek. Also, the few Pelasgian words and texts that exist betray a Greek language even though ancient Greeks called the Pelasgian language "barbarian". 

According to Thomas Harrison, the Greek etymology of Pelasgian words in Herodotus like "theoi" (from Greek "thentes") shows that the "Pelasgians spoke a language at least 'akin to' Greek". According to Pierre Henri Larcher, if this linguistic connection is true, then it proves that the Pelasgians and the Greeks were the same people.

In 1854, Johann Georg von Hahn, an Austrian diplomat and Albanian language scholar, suggested a connection between Early Albanian and Pelasgian. But this theory has been rejected by modern scholars.

Thongalen

Thongalen (also Thongalel, Thongaren or Thongarel) is the god of the dead and the king of the underworld () in Meitei mythology and religion. He is worshipped by the people in Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). 
He is the Guardian God of the nadir.
He is the ancestor-God of the Khuman clan of Meitei people. Laikhurembi and Lainaotabi are his wives.

The "Pakhangba Nonggarol" () says the God of death is called ""Leinung Thongarel"" ().

King Thongaren () asked his highest ranked Queen Laikhurembi () to go with his brother Poireiton on a long trip. Poireiton was a ; his wife had died, and he had six children to raise and also had to go to the "Tai Pang Pan". King Thongalel thought his brother needed a wife to go with him on their trip. However, Queen Laikhurembi did not want to go. She said she was already the king's wife. Trees had already been planted in her honor because she and the king had lived together for a very long time. So, instead of Queen Laikhurembi, King Thongalel sent his second wife, Leinaotabi, to go with Poireiton and be his wife.

Nongban Pombi Luwaoba was a prince in the Luwang dynasty. A dynasty is a line of kings or queens who are all related to each other in the same family. Prince Nongban Pombi Luwaoba and his wife Namoinu were happy. Then she died suddenly. She died because of the God Thongalel. Prince Pombi Luwaoba refused to perform the funeral of her dead body. He hoped the God Thongalel would send her soul back into her body so she would be alive again. God Thongalel received a message from the prince through a pheasant bird. The message said that Prince Nongban Pombi Luwaoba was ready to fight God Thongalel if he did not send Namoinu's soul back. This made the God Thongalel angry. He sent two of his brothers, but Prince Nongban Pombi Luwaoba beat them both. He took them prisoner. Prince Nongban Pombi Luwaoba sent the pheasant bird with another message to God Thongalel. The message said that if the God wanted to get back his brothers alive, then he had to sent back the soul of Namoinu to her body.

Finally, God Thongalel came to meet Prince Pombi Luwaoba himself. But instead of fighting, the prince prayed to the God Himself. God Thongalel was happy that Prince Nongban Pombi Luwaoba showed him respect. Thongalel brought Namoinu back to life. He also gave her a gift: She would live for 100 years and have 100 sons.

God Thongalel is sometimes identified as God Wangpurel (). Thongalel is the King of underworld. Wangpurel reigns over the direction south. Some Meiteis believe that the direction south is the land of death. So, when the Meiteis got converted into Hinduism, both Thongalel and Wangpulel became counterparts of Hindu God Yama.

Plasticine

Plasticine is a putty-like modelling material made from calcium salts, petroleum jelly and fatty acids. It does not dry, and comes in many different colours.

Plasticine is used for children's play and for modelling more formal or permanent structures. 

Because of its non-drying property, it is a good material for stop-motion animation. It has been used for several Oscar-winning films by Aardman Animations (Nick Park). The brand-name clay is sometimes mentioned in British music, such as the "plasticine porters" in The Beatles' "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", the Oasis songs "Little James" and "Shakermaker", the Placebo song "Plasticine", and the Thom Yorke song "Plasticine Figures".

Plasticine was invented in Bath, England in 1897 by an art teacher, William Harbutt. In 1983 production was moved to Thailand. Several attempts have been made to change the formula to evade the patent and its licences. There are a number of similar products, but none has proved more successful. There is, however, a good market for epoxy products which set hard after being applied as a liquid or putty. Plasticine does not set hard.

Plasticine is about 65% gypsum, 10% petroleum jelly, 5% lime, 10% lanolin and 10% stearic acid. It cannot be hardened by firing, melts when exposed to heat, and is flammable at higher temperatures.

Interior point method

Interior point methods are algorithms to solve certain optimization problems. They have been used to find solutions in linear programming and quadratic programming problems. Interior point methods can be used when the solution is a convex set. The problem can then be restated as minimizing or maximizing a linear function over this set of solutions. They are called "interior" point methods, because they approximate the convex set from the inside. Interior point methods are often used because they have a better runtime behavior than the algorithms commonly used with linear programming. Because the sequence of values will converge towards a barrier, they are also known as barrier methods. 

Privacy by design

Privacy by design (PbD) is an idea in systems engineering and information technology.

In privacy by design, the engineers build the system so that it keeps information private starting at the beginning instead of building the system and then adding privacy protection later. In privacy by design, the designers treat privacy protection as just as important as other parts of the design.

Dr. Ann Cavoukian first said the term "Privacy by Design" when she was the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada. Dr. Cavoukian later wrote about the "7 foundational principles" of privacy by design in the 1990s.

The European GDPR regulation incorporates privacy by design which revolves around the following foundational principles:


The authors of more than five hundred other articles have talked about these principles by citing the white paper "Privacy by Design in Law, Policy and Practice" by Ann Cavoukian. Privacy by Design is accepted as the gold standard internationally.

Nongpok Ningthou

Nongpok Ningthou (Meitei: ꯅꯣꯡꯄꯣꯛ ꯅꯤꯡꯊꯧ) is a deity in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). He is the ruling guardian deity of the eastern direction. Legend says Nongpok Ningthou and Panthoibi got united in the Nongmaiching hills (Langmai hills). Later, they were worshipped as the civilization giving deities in Meitei religion.

Nongpok Ningthou is one of the principal Umang Lais. He was originally known as "Langmai Ningthou" (lit. Lord of the Langmai people).

The Nongmaiching Hill (also known as Selloi Langmai Hills) was the ancestral territory of the Selloi Langmai people. This zone has the strongest worship of God Langmai Ningthou (Nongpok Ningthou). According to the Nongmaiching Chingkoipa (AKA Nongmaijing Chingoiba) text, the mountain in the east and beyond the rivers (Imphal R., Iril R. and Kongba R.) is the abode of God Keinou Chingsompa (another name of Nongpok Ningthou).

According to the Thalon (Tharon) text, Selloi Langmai Hill had 5 divisions. Each division was occupied by different ethic groups. Each groups had different ancestral deities. These were later described as the 5 pillars of the Selloi Langmai country.

Later, in the course of time, these 5 gods belonging to 5 different places of the Selloi Langmai Hill were integrated into a single God with the name "Langmai Ningthou". The personal names became the aliases or various forms of the God. With this, the tribal society of the Selloi Langmai people evolved into a chiefdom. This chiefdom later rose to the Angom dynasty.
According to the Naothingkhong Phambal Kaba PuYa, the position of the Langmai Ningthou (lit. "Langmai King") rose to the highest level of the Umang Lai God. He acquired a new title "Nongpok Ningthou". It took place after the uprooting of the Selloi Langmai people by the Meetei King Ura Konthouba in the 7th century AD. With the end of the ethnic conflict, the Selloi Langmai people merged into the Meitei ethnicity. Their deity "Langmai Ningthou" got renamed as "Nongpok Ningthou" (lit. "Sovereign of the East"). The name of the God was given by the Meiteis. The God originally belonged to the Selloi Langmai people. These group of people lived in the East of the Kangla, the capital of the Meitei kingdom.

The Cheitharol Kumbaba mentioned the God for the first time during the reign of King Khagemba (1597 AD-1652 AD).

God Nongpok Ningthou and Goddess Panthoibi are true lovers. They first met when the goddess was wandering in the open meadows, bathing and sporting in the cool waters of the running river. She was captivated by the handsome looks and towering personality of Nongpok Ningthou (alias Angoupa Kainou Chingsangsompa). They fell in love at first sight. He proposed her to elope with him. But the already married goddess didn't accept the instant proposal very soon because it was not even five days passed after her wedding. She insisted him to spend some time.

The two lovers met secretly but regularly many times. Panthoibi's behavior causes her in-laws to have suspicion over her. Her mortal husband, Khaba Sokchrongba, tried to win her heart with many tricks. But these were useless to the goddess. Nongpok Ningthou eloped with Goddess Panthoibi, his true lover, wearing the attires of the Tangkhuls.

Nongpok Ningthou and Panthoibi, the two divine lovers, united on the Nongmaiching Hills. Their joyous union was celebrated with dances and music by the divine beings. These celebration gave birth to the Lai Haraoba festival.

In another version of the story, Nongpok Ningthou met goddess Panthoibi for the first time when she was helping her father at jhum cultivation (Slash-and-burn). They fell in love at first sight without no conversation. But Panthoibi was married to another man against her will. She left her husband's house to search for her true beloved. Nongpok Ningthou also left his home for the same purpose. The lovers met at the Kangla. Kangla became the place of their divine union. So, it is considered to be an auspicious place of coronation of the Meitei kings.

Most of the surviving cults and shrines dedicated to God Langmai Ningthou (Nongpok Ningthou) are located in the Nongmaiching Hill (Selloi Langmai Hill) and its nearby areas.

A few of the most prominent shrines include: (1) Nongpok at Yairipok, (2) Panam Ningthou at Andro, (3) Nongpok Ningthou at Khoirom, (4) Pureiromba at Lamlai, (5) Nongpok Ningthou at Engourok (Ingourok), (6) Pureiromba at Naharup, (7) Nongpok Ningthou at Takhel, (8) Pureiromba at Bamon Kampu, (9) Nongpok Ningthou at Charangpat Maning, (10) Waroi Ching Malang Lamhuiba at Waroi Ching, (11) Nongpok at Chandrakhong.

These shrines are under the institution of the Umang Laism. However, there are many shrines of God Langmai Ningthou independent from the Umang Laism. Examples include Chingyai, Kharong, Isingchaibi, Nungpak Khul, Chingoi, etc. Due to the independence from the Umang Laism, these shrines were absorbed into Hinduism during the post-Charairongba era in Manipur.

Item

Item (pronounced eetem), is a place in Nigeria. It is one of the communities in Bende Local Government Area in Abia State, Nigeria. It is next to Akeze (in Ebony State) in the north, Nkporo in the east, Alayi in the west, and Abiriba and Igbere in the south.

The Okpi Stool is an ancient, sacred, foremost or highest traditional institution in Item. The Okpi is the father of Item people. The Okpi is the Paramount Ruler of Item and Clan Head of Item. The Okpi Stool is non-religious and non-political; rather he is the father of all religious and political bodies. Okpi of Item is the head of the executive, legislature and judiciary in Item traditional system of government.

Before the beginning of colonial government, Item people had a stable traditional government. Okpi was and still is the father of Item and the pinnacle of the whole genealogy. In Item generally as in most neighbouring communities like Abam, Abiriba and Ututu, the Otosi or Ofo Eze is the system of supreme authority of rulership.

It would be extremely difficult to describe or explain the influence and importance of the Otosi in the life of Item people. All authorities in the community derive legitimacy from the Otosi or Ofo Eze, hence traditional rulership in Item is hereditary.

The kindred’s with royal and priestly responsibilities are those that brought Otosi to Item from Potopo. The Otosi or Ofo Eze remains the most important symbol of authority in Item.

The Otosi or Ofo Eze is a very powerful swagger always left in the authority of traditional Ruling and Royal Kindreds. The Otosi was and remains a source of strength succour, bond of unity, as well as political and religious union, hence you hear the slogan “ITEM BU ULORANI” [Item is one house]. Little wonder, all important cultural festivals in Item, such as Igwa Nmam, Ita Achicha, Iwa Ama and Iri Ndi are celebrated on same day in Item Clan.

The following are the ancestral royal and ruling kindred in Item: Ndi Okorocha Apuanu Item, Umuafiaji Okoko Item, Ekwo Amaokwe Item and Umuovum Ameke Item. In the olden days, these four royal kindred constitute the Abu Ano Item  Item King Makers and their heads were the heads of the four original villages in Item.

They were assisting the Okpi of Item, who doubled as the chairman of Obu Ano Item in performing the executive, legislative and judicial functions. In these four villages, they are second in command to the traditional village heads, otherwise known as “AGBA EZE” in Apuanu Item, the Agba Eze is Ndu Ihize, in Okoko Item- Umuogbe Okoko Item in Amaokwe Item  Amafor Amaokwe Item, in Ameke Item Ndi Elekwa/Ugwuapu/Amaoba.

As farmsteads expanded and increased both in population and socio-economic activities, they were given village status. They include Okagwe, Umuakpa, Akanu, Okai and Amaekpu Item. In other to have efficient and effective government in Item, the heads of the five new villages were admitted into the Council of Chief and Elders, still under the chairmanship of Okpi of Item no matter the venue of their meeting.

They perform the executive functions in their various villages but were not vested with the sceptre of Otosi or Ofo Eze. Nonetheless, it must be noted that in these five villages only the kith and kin of heads and second in command were the heads, hence it is convenient and appropriate to incorporate them into the supreme council of Obu Ano Item  Item King-Makers.

No wonder, the colonial government after a careful study opined that Item had a stable traditional government similar to the system in England and congratulated as well as encouraged Item people on their orderly system of government.

Whenever there is a vacancy usually by the demise of the ruling Okpi, the Stool of Okpi Item devolves on the next senior man in Ndi Okorocha Royal Kindred, except where he objects to taking the office for a reason. Immediately after the death of the ruling Okpi and before new one takes office, the son of the deceased Okpi or a minor a regent from his family is appointed by the king-makers to act as Okpi, until the new Okpi is selected and installed in accordance with age-long tradition of Item.

Java mouse-deer

The Java mouse-deer ("Tragulus javanicus") is a leaf-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous ungulate in the family Tragulidae. When it reaches maturity it is about the size of a rabbit, making it the smallest living ungulate. It is found in forests in Java and perhaps Bali, although sightings there have not been verified.

The Java mouse-deer's common scientific name is "Tragulus javanicus", although other classification names for it exist, including "Tragulus javanica", "Cervus javanicus", and the heterotypic synonym "Tragulus fuscatus". The Java mouse-deer is also known by many common names, including Javan chevrotain, Javan mousdeer, or Java Mousedeer. The taxonomic status of the Java mouse-deer is questionable, but recent craniometric analyses have begun to shed light on the taxonomic discrepancies. Previously, the Java mouse-deer, "Tragulus javanicus", was commonly thought to represent the wider class of large chevrotains, but it was found that these, unlike the Java mouse-deer, do not likely reside on Java. Three species groups of "Tragulus" have been identified based on craniometric skull analyses and coat coloration patterns. These three species groups are "Tragulus javanicus", "Tragulus napu", and "Tragulus versicolor". Based upon these craniometric analyses, "Tragulus javanicus" was then further separated based on the organisms’ known geographic locations: "Tragulus williamsoni" (found in northern Thailand and possibly southern China), "Tragulus kanchil" (found in Borneo, Sumatra, the Thai–Malay Peninsula, islands within the Greater Sunda region, and continental Southeast Asia), and "Tragulus javanicus" (found in Java). Thus, because of its uniqueness to the island of Java, the Java mouse-deer is now considered a distinct species, although this fact has not significantly affected its current classification.

Mouse-deer possess a triangular-shaped head, arched back, and round body with elevated rear quarters. The thin, short legs which support the mouse-deer are about the diameter of an average pencil. Although Java mouse-deer do not possess antlers or horns like regular deer, male Java mouse-deer have elongated, tusk-like upper canines which protrude downward from the upper jaw along the sides of their mouth. Males use these “tusks” to defend themselves and their mates against rivals. Females can be distinguished from males because they lack these prominent canines, and they are slightly smaller than the males. Java mouse-deer can furthermore be distinguished by their lack of upper incisors. The coat coloration of the Java mouse-deer is reddish-brown with a white underside. Pale white spots or vertical markings are also present on the animal's neck.

With an average length of and an average height of , the Java mouse-deer is the smallest extant (living) ungulate or hoofed mammal, as well as the smallest extant even-toed ungulate. The weight of the Java mouse-deer ranges from , with males being heavier than females. It has an average tail length of about . Mouse-deer are thought to be the most primitive ruminants based on their behaviour and the fossil record, thus they are the living link between ruminants and non-ruminants.

The Java mouse-deer is endothermic and homoeothermic, and has an average basal metabolic rate of about 4.883 watts. It also has the smallest red blood cells (erythrocytes) of any mammal, and about 12.8% of the cells have pits on them. The pits range in diameter from 68 to 390 nanometres. Red blood cells with pits are unique and have not been reported before either physiologically or pathologically.

"Tragulus javanicus" is usually considered to be endemic to Java, Indonesia. There have been unverified reports of sightings on Bali.

The Java mouse-deer prefers habitats of higher elevations and the tropical forest regions of Java, although it does appear at lower elevations between above sea level. During the day, Java mouse-deer can be seen roaming in crown-gap areas with dense undergrowth of creeping bamboo, through which they make tunnels through the thick vegetation which lead to resting places and feeding areas. At night, the Java mouse-deer moves to higher and drier ridge areas. It has been argued that Java mouse-deer are an “edge” species, favoring areas of dense vegetation along riverbanks. Additionally, Java mouse-deer have been found to be more prevalent in logged areas than in the more mature forests, and their densities tended to decrease proportionately as the logged forests matured.

Java mouse-deer are primarily herbivores, although in captivity they have been observed to eat insects as well as foliage. Their diet consists primarily of that which they find on the ground in the dense vegetation they inhabit, and they prefer the plants of the faster-growing gap species over the closed forest understory species, likely due to the increased richness of secondary protective compounds which the gap species provide. They are often classified as folivores, eating primarily leaves, shrubs, shoots, buds, and fungi, in addition to fruits which have fallen from trees. The fruits which Java mouse-deer commonly consume range from , while the seeds range from .

Groups of Java mouse-deer are commonly referred to as “herds,” while females are termed “does,” “hinds,” or “cows.” Males are referred to as either “bucks,” “stags,” or “bulls,” and their young are commonly called “fawns,” or “asses”. 
It was previously believed that Java mouse-deer were nocturnal, but more recent studies have shown that they are neither truly nocturnal nor diurnal, but instead crepuscular, meaning they prefer to be active during the dim light of dawn and dusk. This behavior has been observed in both wild and captive Java mouse-deer. Although Java mouse-deer form monogamous family groups, they are usually shy, solitary animals. They are also usually silent; the only noise they make is a shrill cry when they are frightened. 
Male Java mouse-deer are territorial, marking their territory and their mates with secretions from an intermandibular scent gland under their chin. This territorial marking usually includes urinating or defecating to mark their area. To protect themselves and their mates or to defend their territory, mouse-deer slash rivals with their sharp, protruding canine “tusks.” It has also been observed that, when threatened, the Java mouse-deer will beat its hooves quickly against the ground, reaching speeds of up to 7 beats per second, creating a “drum roll” sound. 
The territories of "Tragulus javanicus" males and females have been observed to overlap considerably, yet individuals of the same sex do not share their territories. When giving birth, however, females tend to establish a new home range. Female Java mouse-deer have an estimated home range of , while males inhabit, on average, . Additionally, male Java mouse-deer, in nature, were observed to travel distances of daily on average, while females average daily.

Java mouse-deer are capable of breeding at any time during the year, and this has been observed during captivity. However, some sources have observed that the breeding season for the Java mouse-deer in nature occurs from November to December. Additionally, female mouse-deer have the potential to be pregnant throughout most of their adult life, and they are capable of conceiving 85–155 minutes after giving birth. The Java mouse-deer's gestation period usually lasts 4.5 months, or 144 days. Typical litters consist of a single fawn, which resembles a miniature adult, although the tusk-like incisors prevalent in males are not visible in the young mouse-deer. The average mass of a newborn fawn is , and these precocial young are capable of standing within 30 minutes after birth. Fawns are capable of eating solid food within two weeks, yet it takes around 12 weeks to completely wean the fawns. On average, it takes the young, both male and female, 167 days (~5 months) to reach sexual maturity. Mouse-deer have been observed to live up to 14 years in captivity, but their lifespan in nature is still an open question.

One of the main predators which the Java mouse-deer face is humans. Through the destruction of their habitat, as well as from hunting and trapping the mouse-deer for food, their pelts, and for pets, humans have considerably reduced the Java mouse-deer population. Mouse-deer are particularly vulnerable to being hunted by humans at night because of their tendency to freeze when illuminated by having a spotlight shone on them. Because of the small size of the Java mouse-deer, dogs are also a common predator for them, as well as crocodiles, big cats, birds of prey, and snakes.

Although research into the diseases and parasites which affect the Java mouse-deer are still nascent, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV 1), a pestivirus of the family flaviviridae has been detected in Java mouse-deer. Mouse-deer acquire this virus through fetal infection during early pregnancy. Once acquired, individuals with BVDV can gain lifelong immune tolerance.

Java mouse-deer is currently categorized as “Data Deficient” on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List. This data deficiency is due to the inconclusiveness regarding the distinct separation of "Tragulus" species, in addition to the lack of information on "Tragulus javanicus". Even comparison of past observed numbers of Java mouse-deer with those presently observed does not greatly aid researchers because of the high likelihood of inaccuracy in past observations. Although listed as “Data Deficient,” it is highly probable that a decline in the numbers of Java mouse-deer is occurring, and upon further investigation of this issue, the Red List status of "Tragulus javanicus" could easily change to “Vulnerable”. Some conservation actions which have been implemented include legally protecting the species, which, although it has been in effect since 1931, makes no significant difference since hunting of Java mouse-deer still occurs. Additionally, some areas of Java which the Java mouse-deer frequents have been protected, yet enforcement of these regulations is still needed. One of the greatest conservation efforts needed is simply more information about the species: a more complete definition of its taxonomy, as well as more information on its habitat and behavior.

Historically, the mouse-deer has featured prominently in Malay and Indonesian folklore, where it is considered a wise creature. This character, Sang Kancil (pronounced “Kahn-cheel”), is a diminutive but wise mouse-deer. Sang Kancil is a tiny and cunning hero who, through his intelligence, is able to prevail over his larger tyrants and foes.

Marjing

Marjing () is a primordial deity in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). He is the God of horses, polo, hockey, sports and war. The guardianship of the north eastern direction is alluded to Marjing and the other directions to Koubru (north west), Thangjing (south west) and Wangbren (south east). According to the legend, he invented the game of polo (Sagol Kangjei) and introduced it as the national game. He and his divine creature, Samadon Ayangba, reside in the top of the Heingang hills.

According to the Leithak Leikharol PuYa, God Marjing (mentioned as ""Maraching"") originated from the intestines of Atiya Sidaba. He was created to control Samadon Ayangba, the divine horse (). The horse was created from the foot of Ashiba (Sanamahi).

God Marjing is one of the five gods who enter into the human body and position themselves as one of the souls. Marjing dwells in the heart of human body. The God is also associated with Sagol Kangjei (Polo), the main sports of the Meitei people. Parratt says ""His main importance in Meitei mythology is that he is credited with the invention of polo, the national game.""

Sagol Kangjei () is originally the game of gods. There are 7 players on each side. They used "Kangdrum" (a ball made from bamboo root). This is what the human beings imitate from them. The first divine polo match was played during the festival of Lai Haraoba.

During the Lai Haraoba festival, a maibi (priestess) performs a ritual in the form of a mime. She holds a mallet in her hand and enacts the game of polo.

Every year, in the top of the Heingang Hills, devotees offer polostick (, ) and bamboo-root-ball () to God Marjing. This is done even when any animal in one's house become sick.

In 1618 AD, during the reign of King Khagemba, a public worship took place at his abode and also at every watery place on the river side. Wild boars, ducks, cocks, hen, pigeons and other creatures were offered to God Marjing. This was recorded in the Cheitharol Kumbaba.

Wangpulen

Wangpulen (also, Wangpuren or Wangbaren 
or Wangbren) is the god of water, rain, flood, disease and sickness in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur).
He is the ruler of the underwater world. He is the Lord of the rivers. The guardianship of the south eastern direction is alluded to Wangbren and the other directions to Koupalu (north west), Marjing (north east) and Thangjing (south west). He is one of the Umang Lais.

He has a strong connection with the Anal tribe (Anan tribe) for marrying a lady of the Anal Khullen village. Among the cult centres dedicated to him, the one at Sugnu is the most significant in Meitei pantheon.

In the Wakoklon Heelel Thilel Salai Amailon Pukok Puya, Wangbren is mentioned as ""Khana Chaopa Wangpulen"". According to the text, He is one of the 7 Laipungthous and one of the manifestations of the Supreme God, Ipung Loinapa Apakpa.

Once God Wangbren went to the village of the Anal people, disguising Himself as a human. He fell in love with a beautiful girl, Shagnu. The maiden was also attracted to His good looks. The girl's affair with a stranger angered the community. The young men of the village challenged Wangbren to fight. There were competitions in race, stone throw and archery. If He failed, He would be killed. But He won all the challenges. As He won, He took Shangnu, the maiden away with Him to His divine abode.

Whenever one gets drowned, Wangbren is worshipped according to the traditional rites and rituals. They did so in a belief that there will be no further deaths in water. Whenever unusual flood water currents are seen, especially in rivers, He is worshipped by people to save them from drowning and other mishaps.

If a drowned person's dead body is not found, then a portion of the trunk of palash tree (Butea monosperma) is cremated. It is done in a belief that Wangbren might have kept the corpse at a sacred place.

Wangbren is worshipped by offering fruits, flowers and kabok. The rites and rituals are performed by the maibas. It is to ward off the diseases, illness or sickness caused by the water god. Examples include skin diseases, cold and cough, diarrhoea, etc.

In the planning, 

A sacred shrine dedicated to Wangbren still exists today in the Sugnu village. Annually, the non-Christian Anal villagers give offerings to their priest. The priest took and offer the articles to the God in Sugnu.

Inside the Kangla, the State Government is to renovate and reconstruct the holy altars dedicated to God Wangbren and other deities.

In 2010, a temple dedicated to God Wangbren was constructed at Wangoi, Manipur. The temple building construction costs ₹ 8 lacs INR ($10,000 USD).

Thangching

Thangching (also, Thangjing) is a primordial deity in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). 
He is the ruling deity of the Moirang dynasty of Ancient Moirang. He rules supreme on the banks of the landlocked sea, Loktak lake. He is one of the four cardinal Umang Lais.
The guardianship of the south western direction is alluded to Thangjing and the other directions to Koubru (north west), Marjing (north east) and Wangbren (south east).

Two of his most prominent pantheons are the Thangching Temple and the Thangching Hill (Thangjing Peak).

God Thangjing is a deity of pre-Hindu origin.
The Moirang Ningthourol Lambuba mentioned that Moirang was the amalgamation of different groups of people with different traditional beliefs. During the reign of King Fang Fang Ponglenhanpa (52 BC- 28 AD), all the diversities were merged into one with God Thangjing as the central figure.

When the cult of God Thangjing was merged into the Umang Laism, the folk deities associated with God Thangjing began to be identified with other Umang Lais. One example is that of goddess Ayang Leima Ahal and goddess Ayang Leima Atonpi. These two goddesses were originally associated with fertility and agriculture. This fact is evident in the ritualistic songs praising them. Later, these two female deities were identified as the consorts of God Thangjing.

When God Thangjing was identified as an Umang Lai, the identity of the two goddesses was associated with that of goddess Panthoibi. Thus, the new identity of Goddess Ayang Leima Panthoibi was formed.

Thangjing is described as the Lord of the tiger hunters. The Moirang Ningthourol Lambuba describes God Thangjing as the Divine Chief of Koireng people, the Progenitor of Kege Clan, the Protector of all the domestic as well as wild animals and the Lord of Mahui tribe.

The history of Moirang is always associated with the godly powers of Thangjing. Thangjing is a living God to the people of Ancient Moirang. The epic legend of the Khamba Thoibi is always related to God Thangjing. The ancient temple dedicated to Thangjing still stands on the banks of Loktak lake in the present day Moirang.
In the legendary epic Khamba Thoibi, Lord Thangjing always stands for righteousness and as a saviour of Khamba.

Thangjing sent Phouoibi to Kege Moirang (Keke Moilang) to prosper the human world.

When goddess Panthoibi was searching for her beloved Nongpok Ningthou, she asked God Thangjing and God Wangbren about the whereabouts of Nongpok Ningthou.
To Thangjing, she said:

O! Thangjing, 
Supreme God of Moirang, 
Loktak is your mirror, 
My beloved Nongpok has gone like a wind, 
Like a cattle looking for its herd, 
I am looking for my beloved. 
Please tell me
Does he come to your country?

Thangjing had been worshipped since ancient times. Still today, there is an ancient shrine at Moirang. An annual ritual festival known as Thangjing Haraoba is held early in summer in honor of the God.
During the annual Thangjing Lai Haraoba festival, traditional dances and sports are performed as rituals. The performers follow the ancient customs of wearing the traditional attires of the royal lords and ladies. The festival is celebrated during the Meitei lunar month of Kalen. It continues for a week. Meiteis from all over Manipur visit the Thangjing Temple in Moirang.

The Thangjing plant ("Euryale ferox") is an aquatic plant that bears edible seeds. Its seeds are called "foxnuts" and are one of the most popular food items in Meitei cuisine of Manipur.

The Thangjing Peak (Thangjing Hill) is one of the four peaks, the others being the Koupalu, the Kounu and the Loyalakpa. These peaks are the holy places of worship of the Meitei ethnicity. Their names are derived from the names of the deities whom the Meiteis worship at the peaks.

Koupalu

God Koubru resides in the Mount Koubru (Koubru Hill). The Mount Koubru (Koubru Hill) is the first place of settlement of the Meitei ethnicity, including the Lois of Andro, Khurkhul, Phayeng and Sekmai.

The traditional hymns supplement the theory of origin. 

Awang Koubru Assupa
Leimalai Khunda Ahanba.
Nongthrei Ma-U Lingliba, 
Irik Mapan Thariba, 
Lainingthou! 

English translation of the above passage:

North Koubru all-inclusive (pervasive)
Leima Lai first habitation,
Heaven-flower all things seen established,
Blood drop (Blood cell) planters,
O! Lainingthou (King of Gods)!

This is the hymn of invocation of God Koubru (Koupalu in PuYas).

Lord Koubru is the Omniscient and the Omnipotent Guardian God. He lives on the top of Mount Koubru.
God Koubru, the Heavenly Lord, is said to be the controller of the nine underground wells/tunnels. These are associated with the birth and death of the mankind. The 9 tunnels are sacred to the Meitei people. So, these are still worshipped by the Meiteis.

In the Lai Haraoba festival, a ritualistic folk song dedicated to God Koubru is sung like this:

Awang Koubru Assupa
Eeyen Khunda Ahanba

English translation of the above passage:

Koubru of the North, 
You are the overlord
You are the first place of settlement.

The Meiteis offer a beautiful puppy to God Koubru to free themselves from the sufferings.
The Loi caste of the Meitei ethnicity worship God Koubru on every occasion, including birth, marriage and death. All the Loi villagers excluding Andro are the worshipers of God Koubru.

Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious

"Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious" is the 13th episode of The Simpsons 8th season. It was first broadcast on the Fox network on February 7, 1997. The episode is about the Simpson family getting a nanny named Shary Bobbins (a parody of Mary Poppins). 

The episode was written by Al Jean and Mike Reiss. Chuck Sheetz is the director of the episode. It got a Nielsen rating of 8.8. This means that about 8.5 million people saw the episode when it was first broadcast. In 2014, Jean put the episode in his list of the 5 most important episodes of "The Simpsons".

Marge Simpson starts to lose some of her hair very quickly. Dr. Hibbert says that she is losing hair because of her stress. The Simpson family wants to hire a nanny to care for their children and help with their house. They have trouble finding a good nanny. A woman with an umbrella comes from the sky on to the ground. The woman is Sharry Bobbins and makes herself known to the family. They think there are no problems with her and hire her. 

Shary helps with work around the house. Marge's hair starts to come back. At dinner, Shary says that she does not need to help around with the family anymore. When she leaves the house, she sees Homer strangling Bart, Maggie stopping a fire, and Marge losing hair again. Shary must stay to help with the family again.

The family starts to act rude to Shary and does not care for her excitement. Shary starts to feel depressed and cries. Marge says that Shary can not be able to change how the family acts. The family says in a song that they are happy with how they act. Shary thinks that the family is okay and leaves with her umbrella. She is killed when she flies into a jet engine of an airplane. 

Al Jean and Mike Reiss made a deal with Disney to make four episodes of "The Simpsons". Jean and Reiss thought of the episode's story years before it was made. They talked about the idea with other writers but no one wanted to make an episode with the story. When they were able to make episodes again, they wrote the dialogue of the episode. Reiss first did not like the episode. He thought that the story was foolish and had too much magic in it. He now thinks that it is one of the best episodes he wrote. When it was made, the episode had more music than any other episode. Jean thought that the songs would make the episode as long as it needed to be. However, it was still shorter than regular episodes. Many parts of the episode were added to make it longer. For example, an "Itchy & Scratchy" cartoon was put in the episode. There was going to be a song where Bart, Lisa and Shary go to Patty and Selma and sing about smoking. The song was not put in the episode because producers did not think it was funny. The song was put in the album "Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons". Some animation of the song was shown in the 8th season's DVD as a deleted scene. Eric Stefani made the animation for some of the episode's songs.

Julie Andrews was first going to be the voice actor of Shary. Maggie Roswell was made the voice actor after producers heard her speak some of the episode's dialogue. Producers wanted Quentin Tarantino to be the voice actor for a character in the "Itchy & Scratchy" cartoon. He did not want to because he thought the dialogue was rude. Dan Castellaneta was the voice actor for that character in the episode.

Hourglass tree frog

The hourglass tree frog ("Dendropsophus ebraccatus") is a frog that lives in Mexico, Colombia, Belize and Nicaragua. Scientists have seen it as high as 1600 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is 23.63 to 26.75 mm long from nose to rear end and the largest adult female frogs are 36.5 mm long. Frogs that live high up in the hills are larger than frogs that live low and close to the ocean. This frog's head is wider than its body. It has yellow skin and a brown pattern on its back that look like an hourglass. 

Male frogs sing for females after it rains. The rain creates pools of water that are not there during the dry season. The males sit on plants high above the pools and sing so the females will come to them. There are also "sneaker males" who sit between the pools and the singing males so the females will meet them first.

The females lay 180 to 300 eggs at a time. Most frogs can lay eggs either on land or in water but not both. However, the hourglass tree frog can lay eggs on both. If the pool is in the sun, the female frog will lay her eggs on a piece of plant under the surface of the water so that they don't dry out. If the pool is in the shade, she will lay her eggs near the water so that the tadpoles fall into it after they hatch. For example, she may lay her eggs on a leaf on a branch hanging over the water. If she lays eggs in the water, fish might eat them. If she lays eggs on a leaf, wasps, ants or spiders might eat them.

The tadpoles can be 6.72 to 7.47 mm long when they first hatch and they can grow to 2.9 cm. They eat algae and hide in underwater plants.
The nematode worm parasite "Cosmocerca parva" can infect this frog.

This frog does not get very sick from the chytridiomycosis fungal disease the way many other frogs do. Scientists found that the microbiota of hourglass tree frogs, which is all the bacteria and other microorganisms that live on and in the frog's body, is different from the microbiota of other frogs. Scientists think this might protect the hourglass tree frog from chytridiomycosis but they are not sure.

Scientists and students use the hourglass tree frog as a test animal because it is not endangered and because it can lay eggs on land or in water. Humans also keep these frogs as pets.

Free people of color

When talking about the colonies in the New World, the term free people of color was used for people who had both European, and African, and sometimes native American parents, but who were not slaves.

In the colonies, these people were classified in various ways, usually depending on what they looked like. The term became popular in the late 17th century. In the thirteen colonies, these people were sometimes called free negroes.

The term did not apply to freed slaves, which were usually known as "affranchi", in French.

Jerome Is the New Black

"Jerome Is the New Black" is the 7th episode of Family Guys 8th season. It was first broadcast on the Fox network on November 22, 2009. The episode is about Peter and his friends meeting a guy named Jerome. Peter does not trust him because he learns that Jerome dated Peter's wife before. 

The episode was written by John Viener. Brian Iles is the director of the episode. About 7.38 million people watched the episode when it was first broadcast.

Peter, Quagmire, and Joe are sad because their friend Cleveland went to Virginia. They try to look for another guy to be in their group of friends. They find a black person named Jerome. Jerome becomes their friend when he shows them his skills in darts. At his house, Peter shows Jerome to his wife Lois. She says that she and Jerome dated many years ago. Peter starts to feel jealous. He throws a bottle through Jerome's house. This accidentally starts a fire and burns Jerome's house. Jerome goes to Lois and says that he will hurt the guy who burned his house. He does not know that Peter did it. Lois lets Jerome stay in their house. Peter starts to act very jealously. He dresses as a ghost that makes him look like a member of the Ku Klux Klan. This was to make Jerome leave their house. Lois tells Peter in an argument that Jerome got him a gift. Peter goes back to Jerome and says he is sorry for acting badly to him. Jerome forgives Peter and they still be friends.

Brian wants to be in Peter's group of friends. Peter says that he can not because Quagmire does not like him. Brian goes to Quagmire's house and tries to be good to him. However, he makes Quagmire angry when he accidentally thinks his abused sister is his girlfriend. Brian tries to make Quagmire feel better by getting him to go to dinner. At dinner, Brian tries to start small talk. This does not work, so he asks Quagmire why he does not like him. Quagmire makes a long rant on everything that Brian does that he does not like. Brian goes back home and cries on the way there. Stewie makes him feel better by saying he only needs to like himself. 

The episode was first talked about at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con. The episode was written by John Viener. Brian Iles is the director of the episode. The episode was made to give Peter's group of friend another person after Cleveland Brown was taken out of "Family Guy" and moved to "The Cleveland Show".

The episode was watched by about 7.38 million people when it was first broadcast.

Emily VanDerWerff from "The A.V. Club" thought that the episode's story started well but then got further bad in the episode. She thought that a "South Park" episode with a similar story of Kenny McCormick being replaced was done better. However, she said she liked Quagmire's long rant. Ahsan Haque from IGN did not like how the episode was made. Haque thought that the episode's story sounded better as an idea. Ramsey Isler (another IGN reviewer) said that the episode was not funny and the writing was lazy and not original.

Britain (place name)

The name Britain is very old. The name comes from the ancient Romans' name for the ancient Britons (). The English language word comes from . It can mean Great Britain, the British Isles, or the British state – the United Kingdom.

The Romans started using this name after learning it from the ancient Greeks in the Hellenistic period. The Greeks gave the people of Britain the name in and used as the place name .

The Greek name for the people of Britain was also written as , and as . This name may itself have come from one of the Brythonic languages of ancient Britain. The Greek name is like the word for Britain in the , which comes from the .

There may be a connection between the Greeks' and Romans' name and the Celtic languages. However, it may be that the word comes from one of the languages of the Mediterranean Basin. It could mean "tin". Britain's greatest export in the distant past was tin. Words in ancient Egyptian languages have similarities with the Ancient Greek and Latin names. It is also possible that the word for "tin" in these languages itself came from the name of Britain or its people.

Britannia was the common Latin name for the island of Great Britain starting in the 1st century BC. Britannia replaced the name Albion as the Romans' common name for the island. After the Romans overcame the ancient Britons in war in 43 AD, Britannia could mean just the southern two thirds of the island which was under Roman control. (Caledonia, north of the River Forth in modern Scotland, was only sometimes controlled by the Roman army.)

The writings of the Roman cartographer Ptolemy used the name "Great Britain" for the island in the 2nd century AD. He used the name "Megale Britannia" or "Great Britain" () to show the difference between this larger island and Ireland. For Ireland, Ptolemy used the name "Mikra Britannia" or "Little Britain" ().

The word was used in the Old English language to mean Great Britain. After the time of the Anglo-Saxons, the name Britain was most used in history writing. In the early 16th century however, the name became more common in English for political reasons.

The cabbage white is a common butterfly that occurs from North Africa up to Fennoscandia. There are two to three generations a year, usually Spring to Autumn.

The butterfly has been classified as a pest because, of course, its caterpillars eat cabbages. Sometimes, "Cotesia glomerata", a parasitic wasp, is used as a means of biological pest control.

The butterflies are distasteful to birds because of the mustard-oil glucosides the larvae eat. This oil has a distinctive pungent taste. It is in all plants in the mustard family, Brassicaceae (for example, cabbage, cauliflower, turnip, radish, horseradish, or wasabi).

Their white colour is easily seen, and probably acts as a warning sign.

Judeo-Christian

Christianity started within Judaism, and then became an independent religion. The Old Testament, which is the first half of the Christian bible is based on the 24 books of the Hebrew Bible. Since about the 19th century, the term Judeo-Christian is used, to either describe this common heritage, or to show how Christianity developed from Judaism. The term "Abrahamic religions" also includes other religions, for which Abraham was an important person, most notably Islam. 

At the time of Christ, Judaism was legal within the Roman Empire, and Jews were permitted to worship their religion. Christians were not covered by this arrangement, yet they had in the first century A.D. no Bible: the first book of the New Testament was not written until about 100 AD, though even that date this is not precisely known. It is deduced from its internal content. The other books were written even later. That is why in modern Bibles over half the content is from the Jewish tradition.

The words 'Judæo Christian' first appeared in the 19th century as a word for Jewish converts to Christianity. Some Jewish writers objected, because they felt it was used to pretend there were no important differences between the two religions. It was used a lot in America during the Cold War, to show that the country was united against communist atheism. It is still used sometimes in discussions about Western values and against Islam.

Biedermeier

Biedermeier was a time in the arts and German literature, which occurred between 1815 and 1848. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna ended the Napoleonic Wars. In 1848, there were revolutions in many European Countries. Between 1815 and 1848, the middle class grew. During that time, the forces that had been active before the French Revolution rose to power again. Politically, the times were very hard, and there was a lot of repression. For this reason, most of the arts focused on apolitical life at home. 

In painting, "Biedermeier" focused on landscapes, portraits, and perhaps still lifes, or genre paintings. There are almost no religious or historical paintings. Many painters wanted to copy or to resemble 17th century Dutch painters. Many paintings were realist, almost like a modern-day photograph. Interior portraits were typical for Biedermeier: there the idea was to show a fully furnished room, in all its details.

In music, there's no epoch called "Biedermeier": the only thing that is perhaps worth mentioning that playing music at home, in the family became important, this is known as house concert.

In theatre, the main focus was entertainment, not like the Age of Enlightenment. Also in addition to the national theatres, a number of smaller theatres started to exist.

2013 Pacific typhoon season

The 2013 Pacific typhoon season was an above-normal Pacific typhoon season.

During each season, many national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones, tropical storms, and typhoons will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a certain country. These agencies include the Tropical Storm Risk  Consortium of the University College London, Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration and the Vietnamese National Center for Hydro Meteorological forecasts .

Within the North-western Pacific Ocean, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the Western Pacific, which can mean a tropical cyclone has two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency's RSMC Tokyo — Typhoon Center assigns international names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization's Typhoon Committee, should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of . While the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N-25°N even if the cyclone has had an international name given to it. The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired, by both PAGASA and the Typhoon Committee. Should the list of names for the Philippine region all be used, then names will be taken from an auxiliary list. The first ten of these names are made before the start of the season. Unused names are marked in .

During the season 29 tropical storms developed in the Western Pacific and each one was named by the JMA, when the system was judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of . The JMA selected the names from a list of 140 names, that had been developed by the 14 members nations and territories of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee. During the season the names Leepi and Mangkhut were used for the first time, after they had replaced the names Xangsane and Durian, which were retired after the 2006 season.

After the season the Typhoon Committee retired the names "Sonamu", "Utor", "Fitow" and "Haiyan" from its naming lists, and in February 2015, the names were subsequently replaced with "Jongdari", "Barijat", "Mun" and "Bailu" for future seasons.

During the season PAGASA used its own naming scheme for the 25 tropical cyclones, that either developed within or moved into their self-defined area of responsibility. The names were taken from a list of names, that had been last used during 2009 and was used again during 2017. The names Fabian, Odette and Paolo were used for the first time during the year after the names Ondoy, and Pepeng were retired. The names Wilma, Yolanda, and Zoraida were also used for the first time (and only in the case of Yolanda).

After the season the names Labuyo, Santi and Yolanda were retired by PAGASA, as they had caused over 300 deaths and over PhP1 billion in damages. They were soon replaced on the list with Lannie, Salome and Yasmin.

This table lists all the storms that developed in the northwestern Pacific Ocean west of the International Date Line and north of the equator during 2013. It includes their intensity, duration, name, areas affected, deaths, and damage totals. Classification and intensity values are based on estimations conducted by the JMA. All damage figures are in 2013 USD. Damages and deaths from a storm include when the storm was a precursor wave or an extratropical low.

Gallic Wars

The Gallic Wars were military campaigns waged by the Roman proconsul Julius Caesar against tribes in Gaul between 58 BC and 50 BC. The wars gave Rome rich farmlands in Gaul (roughly France and Belgium up to the Rhine).

Caesar's sub-commanders included Mark Antony, Titus Labienus, Quintus Tullius Cicero (brother of Marcus Tullius Cicero), Publius Licinius Crassus (brother of Marcus Licinus Crassus, the richest man in Rome), Decimus Brutus Albinus and Servius Sulpicius Galba (praetor 54 BC).

Julius Caesar described the Gallic Wars in his book "Commentarii de Bello Gallico". This is the main source, but it makes impossible claims about the number of Gauls killed (over a million), while claiming few Roman casualties. Modern historians believe that Gallic forces were far smaller than Caesar claimed, and that they (the Romans) suffered tens of thousands of casualties. One of the leaders of the Gauls, Vercingetorix, was taken to Rome, and later executed.

The main contemporary source for the conflict is Julius Caesar's "Commentarii de Bello Gallico". This was thought to be truthful and accurate until the 20th century. Even in 1908, Camille Jullian wrote a comprehensive history of Gaul and took Caesar's account as absolutely true. But after World War II, historians began to question if Caesar's claims stood up.

Modern estimates are that at the battle of Alesia, in 52 BC, there were about 70,000 Gauls, and the same number of Roman troops. That is still a very large number, in a world with far fewer people than is the case today.

Cocktail party effect

When they are in a noisy environment, humans have the ability to focus their hearing onto one source. This phenomenon is called cocktail party effect. It is named after the fact that a person attending a noisy cocktail party is able to focus their listening to the conversation they are doing, and disregard the other conversations. 

It has been proposed that one's sensory memory subconsciously parses all stimuli and identifies discrete pieces of information by classifying them by salience. This effect is what allows most people to "tune into" a single voice and "tune out" all others. This phenomenon is often described in terms of "selective attention" or "selective hearing". It may also describe a similar phenomenon that occurs when one may immediately detect words of importance coming from unattended stimuli, for example hearing one's name among a wide range of auditory input.

An inability to segregate stimuli in this way is sometimes referred to as the cocktail party problem or cocktail party deafness.

Financial technology

Financial technologies "(FinTech)" are technologies which people use in financial services to help companies manage the financial aspects of their business. Nowadays fintech is the basis for all online transactions - money transfers, loans and more. Many technology startups and large organizations that try to improve financial services are considered to be a part of fintech.

Or Fintech refers to the integration of technology into services offering by financial companies so as to improve their use and delivery to their consumers.

FinTech refers to new applications, processes, products or business models in the field of financial services that are provided through the Internet. Services may be provided by different independent providers at the same time. Usually it includes at least one licensed bank or insurance company. Their interaction is often regulated by special laws and regulations, such as the European Payment Services Directive.

FinTech companies are special because of the ability to create innovations.

It was said by the Professor of the School of Management in Friborg Patrick Schueffel that ""Fintech is a new financial industry that uses technology to improve its financial performance"". It is considered to be the meaning of the term.

The word fintech was first published in the 1980s: an article by Peter Knight entitled FinTech was published in the Sunday Times. It meant the bot that made the changes to his email.

The companies in the field of fintech began to grow rapidly and changed a lot after the global financial crisis in 2008. Large corporations began to invest in the fintech business, which was like an alternative to the old business models of the financial sector. Traditional banks, on the other hand, had millions of customers who wanted new service standards.

Old Irish

Old Irish was the Goidelic language in the Middle Ages. People spoke Old Irish in Ireland, before the year 1000 AD. Old Irish was a Goidelic language, and modern Goidelic languages like Irish and Scots Gaelic came from it.

People speaking Insular Celtic languages probably first came to Ireland at the start of the Iron Age, about 500 BC. By around 500 AD, people in Ireland all had the same Goidelic language and culture. Speakers of Old Irish began to move to Britain as Britain became weaker. Other peoples of Britain named these people the Scot.

Old Irish was the only language in the Goidelic languages until Old Irish split into the modern Goidelic languages of Irish, Scots Gaelic, and Manx. These languages are Insular Celtic languages and part of the bigger group of Celtic languages.

Radio 101.2

Radio 101.2 was a radio station in Belarus. It worked from Minsk. In 1995 and 1996, the radio station used the frequency 101.2 FM. It was sent news and had no connection to the government of Belarus. The people who worked at the Radio 101.2 mostly came from the radio station Belarusian Youth () that had been forced to go out of business.

Soros Foundation helped to buy the things for the new radio in 1995. The station was closed on formally technical reasons. Its frequency was handed over to the Belarusian Republican Youth Union, which still uses it today. The Belarussian government said that the radio station and its frequency were interfering with the radio communications of the Minsk police. Independent groups said that this was another form to stop the freedom of the press in Belarus by the government of Alexander Lukashenko.

Music judge Dzmitry Padbiarezski said in 2000 that the Belarusian radio 101.2 had high public interest because it played good music and its DJs were experts too.

Big Three television networks

The Big Three television networks are the three biggest television networks in the United States that are still running. These networks are ABC, CBS, and NBC. The Big Three networks ruled over television in the United States until the 1990s. To this day, they are still considered major, long-lasting United States television networks.

NBC and CBS were both founded as radio networks in the 1920s. Later on, NBC would have two radio networks for the United States. These networks were the Red Network and the Blue Network. They soon began television stations in the 1930s. In 1943, the U.S. government noticed how unfair it was for NBC to have two networks. They forced NBC to sell one of their networks. NBC chose to sell the Blue Network. Later on, the Blue Network became the ABC.

The DuMont Television Network launched in 1944. The three networks once controlled a few television stations. After a while, they affiliated with other stations to cover almost the entire United States by the late 1950s. Most of these stations are affiliated somehow with all three major networks and DuMont in markets where only one or two television stations operated in the early years of commercial television. It made some TV shows hard to handle. As more stations signed on, ABC, NBC, and CBS could carry enough programming on one station.

DuMont did not have a radio network like ABC or CBS. During all this, the Mutual Broadcasting System had considered creating a TV network. They would have Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer make some of the programming. WOR-TV & WOIC were known as "Mutual Television." This is the only evidence of the television network. Mutual then bought a stake in the Overmyer Network in 1967. That network never succeeded.

For most of television history, the Big Three controlled most of television. DuMont stopped airing in 1955. From 1961 to the early 1990s, there were only three networks. Every hit series and every feature movie was aired by one of the Big Three networks.

There were attempts to become the fourth network. But they never work out. The cost of starting a network, the difficulty of competing with the Big Three and broadcasting were common in the 1980s. The Big Three had just enough stations to defeat anyone who tried to be just like them. Those networks that could have had the chance to compete would shut down because of legal threats.

An attempt for a fourth television network for the Big Three would not happen again until Fox was founded in October 1986. Fox became a fourth network in 1994 after a law forcing cable providers to add local stations was approved. The rules allowed Fox to become recognized by most audiences and become the fourth network.

Fox has beaten ABC and NBC in the ratings for its primetime programming. This made Fox become the second most-watched network behind CBS during the 2000s. From 2007 to 2008, Fox was the highest-rated of the big broadcast networks. Fox was even the first non-Big Three network to reach first place. From 2004 to 2012, Fox became known for its 18-49 demographic shows. Because of its success, it has been included with the Big Three. It was used with the term "Big Four."

Although Fox is known as the nation's fourth major network, it is not considered part of the Big Three. One reason being that Fox reduced its weekday programming. It does not have enough national morning and evening news programs. Fox does not feature any daytime programming, enough primetime, late-night talk shows, and Saturday morning children's programming. Fox had a block for children's programs in the 1990s called Fox Kids. However, it was sold to The Walt Disney Company in 2001 as part of Fox Family Channel.

Outside of prime time, Fox affiliates either make their programming or run syndicated shows. Fox also allows affiliates the option to air the Xploration Station block on Saturday mornings in place of the optional Weekend Marketplace infomercials block.

Other networks soon launched in an attempt to compete with the Big Three as well as Fox. However, these "netlets" were not as successful as Fox. The WB and UPN launched in 1995. Just like Fox, they both added nights of prime time programming a few years later. The WB was the only one that aired any on weekends.

Both networks only aired prime time and children's programming. The children's programming was the only form of weekday daytime programming offered by either one. UPN discontinued its children's programming in 2003 after a deal with Disney. After that, UPN aired sports events such as the XFL, as well as "WWF SmackDown!".

Although The WB and UPN both had some popular series during their time, they struggled from poor viewership and financial losses. It led their parent companies (Time Warner and CBS Corporation) to shut them down in 2006. They soon joined together in a joint venture called The CW. It originally had a mix of programs from their past networks. But they soon made new shows after the launch.

Fox launched MyNetworkTV at the same time as The CW, with a lineup of English language telenovelas. Later on, it shifted towards unscripted programs and movies. But because of low ratings, it led News Corporation to convert the channel into a syndication service in 2009.

Like Fox, the PBS is not considered part of the Big Three networks. PBS is a noncommercial service with a different distribution model compared to the major networks. Its stations own the network rather than the network owning some of its stations and affiliating with additional stations owned by other broadcasters. It keeps memberships with more than one educational station.

Today, the "Big Three" only control a small portion of the television market in the United States. It has suffered as a result of growing competition from other networks. Traditional networks such as Fox, The CW, and MyNetworkTV, Spanish language networks such as Univision and Telemundo, even national cable and satellite channels such as TNT, ESPN, and AMC, and web channels such as Netflix are sharing the space as well.

Shakespeare's editors

Shakespeare's editors were important in the making of producing printed books and the evolution of textual criticism.

The 17th-century folio collections of the plays of William Shakespeare did not have editors. At the time, it was agreed that the plays included in the First Folio (1623) were to be gathered together or "compiled" by John Heminges and Henry Condell. They were two long-time coworkers of Shakespeare in the King's Men. The play manuscripts may have been proofread and prepared for printing by Edward Knight. He is the "book-keeper" or prompter of the company. The task of proofreading and correcting the actual printed pages of the Folio was left to the compositors and printers in the print-shop.

Not a lot is known about the making of the Second (1632), Third (1663–64), and Fourth Folios (1685).

In the 18th century, some people made the first coordinated efforts to fix the problems that the Folios presented.


The early 19th century saw the first Variorum editions of Shakespeare's works. These are editions that organized and combine the efforts of all the editors from the 18th century. The first edition edited by Isaac Reed released in 1803. The second edition released in 1813 changed a few things from the first. The third edition edited by James Boswell released in 1821.

These editions set the standards for professionally fixing works such as Shakespeare's works. The text was permanently set in the Cambridge edition. It was also set by the Globe edition (1864). It continued on by the New Cambridge edition in 1921. Now, all editions come mostly from this edition.

The Cambridge Shakespeare (1863–66), moved away from a single editor following his own instincts and judgments. The first volume of the Cambridge Shakespeare was edited by William George Clark and John Glover. And the later eight volumes by Clark and William Aldis Wright. Clark and Wright also created the single-volume Globe Shakespeare (1864) using their Cambridge texts. Together, these editions became the standard for a while.

The most wonderful edition in the twentieth century was the Oxford Shakespeare. It was edited by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor. It looks to show the scripts as they were originally written.

Johnny Castaway

Johnny Castaway is a screensaver released in 1992 by Sierra On-Line/Dynamix. It was under the Screen Antics brand and was said to be "the world's first story-telling screen saver".

A man, Johnny Castaway, is stuck on a very small island with one palm tree. He often fishes, builds sand castles, and jogs. Other things happen less often, such as a mermaid or Lilliputian pirates coming to the island, or a seagull flying down to steal his shorts while he is bathing. Much like the castaways of "Gilligan's Island", he is sometimes almost rescued, but is still on the island because of accidents.

Easter eggs happen on some holidays or events often celebrated in the United States, such as Halloween, Christmas and Independence Day, in which a related thing also appears. For example, the palm tree has a "Happy New Year" banner during the last week of the year, and a Jack-o'-lantern is in the sand on Halloween. The time on the computer can be changed to the time of the holiday or event to make it happen at the wrong time.

Johnny Castaway came on a 3½-inch floppy disk and required a computer with, at minimum, a 386SX CPU and Windows 3.1. Now it is widely available on the internet, but because it requires 16-bit software components that do not work in modern versions of Windows, it only works on older versions of Microsoft Windows without workarounds, which exist on Windows 64-bit, Mac OS X and Linux.

Shawn Bird designed the characters while he was at Dynamix. The program was developed by Jeff Tunnell Productions, the Jeff Tunnell in the name meaning the founder of Dynamix. Ken Williams said the screensaver was one of Dynamix's products that did not cost much money to create and make, and made them much more money, along with The Incredible Machine and Hoyle Card Games, which Sierra also published.

"Computer Gaming World" said "Johnny Castaway" was "a great launch" for Screen Antics and "Fans of Johnny Hart-style comics and sight gag lovers everywhere should love it".

Monika Herceg

Monika Herceg (born 1990, in Sisak) is a Croatian poet, playwright, editor, feminist and activist. She is from the small village Pecki near Petrinja, Croatia. She was awarded multiple literature prizes. She is known for being a prominent young poet of the new generation and the most awarded young author in recent Croatian history, sometimes called a "literary sensation". She explores the topics of poverty, domestic violence, immigration, and class and gender inequalities.

She grew up in small village Pecki, near Petrinja, where she studied Physics, first at University of Zagreb and then at the University of Rijeka. She currently lives, works as an editor and raises two kids in Zagreb.

“No one among our contemporary authors laughs like Monika Herceg; nor writes more sorrowful poems,” writes Miljenko Jergović, a Croatian novelist and essayist. The latter statement is especially true when it comes to Herceg’s debut poetry collection "Initial Coordinates." The poems in the book portray the lives of women in rural Croatia throughout the twentieth century, whose stories of poverty and struggle are recounted in the voices of Herceg’s family members.

“There were no books in our house, and paper was only used to light the fire,” Monika recalls. However, during her education in the Croatian town of Petrinja, her teachers soon recognized her talent and provided her the support her family could not. Herceg began writing poetry while working several jobs, all taken on to finance her study of physics.

In 2017, she won "Goran" for her book Početne koordinate(Initial Coordinates), the most important award for young authors in Croatia. As a result, the book was published in 2018 and, after that, she won the "Kvirin Award," "Fran Galović" "Slavić" award and the international award "Mostovi Struge". 

"Initial Coordinates" details Herceg’s return to the roots of her family and to those earliest, often traumatic, memories that have haunted her throughout her life. 

Her second book, Lovostaj" ("The Closed Season") (Jesenski i Turk, 2019.), was also a success: the manuscript won the "Na vrh jezika" award for the best unpublished poetry volume in 2018 and was published in 2019. Her third book, Vrijeme prije jezika ("Time Before the Tongue) (Fraktura, 2020 ) won the "Zvonko Milković" award. 

At the international level, she won the second prize of the "International Poetry Competition Castello di Duino" that took place in Italy in 2016 and in 2018, she was granted the "Bridges of Struga" award during the Mostovi Struge festival in Macedonia for best debut of a young author. In 2021 she won the "Fierce Women" award for her activism.

Her works have been translated in more than fifteen languages and they were published by some well-known magazines. She is part of "Versopolis", an online platform dedicated to the promotion of young European authors. Her trilingual poetry books have been published in Lithuania and Austria. Another selection of her works have been published in French as "Ciel sous tension", L’Ollave, 2019.

A theodolite is a tool for measuring angles between two places (or points) from one place. They are usually associated with surveying. They are often mounted on a special kind of tripod.

They are usually a telescope on a mount that can move horizontally (left and right) and vertically (up and down). The mount has a scale where the readings are taken, usually in degrees for older models and arc minutes or arc seconds for newer models.

Brian, Stewie, and Mort get in a motorbike to get away from the officers. They steal a U-boat and make it to England. The return pad does not have uranium to work. Brian says that the only place that has uranium is in a nuclear power plant in Berlin, Nazi Germany. They join the Royal Air Force and get in a dogfight with Luftwaffe Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters. They make it to the nuclear power plant in Berlin. Stewie makes himself look like Adolf Hitler so he can get uranium. They find the real Hitler, who wants them executed. They get the uranium needed for the return pad and makes it go to the present.

They make it in Stewie's room 30 seconds before Mort first went in the time machine. Stewie kills the Mort that was in Germany by putting him in the time machine and destroying it with a raygun. The first Mort does not make it to the bathroom quick enough.

Community (ecology)

In ecology, a community is the living things in a place. It may mean a group of living things that are not dependent on other communities. It may mean a small group, such as the living things in a piece of dead wood. Populations of many species make up a community. A community with its physical and chemical environment makes an ecosystem. Each population may have an effect on other populations in the community in different ways (called symbiosis).

In consumption, one living thing eats another. Three kinds of consumption are predation, herbivory, and parasitism. In predation, one animal, the predator, kills and eats another animal, the prey. In herbivory, an animal called an herbivore eats a plant, either in part or in whole. In parasitism, a parasite lives on another living thing, the host. The parasite eats small parts of tissue or nutrients from the host, but usually does not kill it.

In competition, two living things, from the same or different species, both need the same resources. If one species is better at getting the resources, the population of the other species may die out. Competition may have a negative effect on both species. In mutualism, two species both help each other, so they have a positive effect on each other. In commensalism, one species is helped, but it has no effect on the other species.

Don't Hug Me I'm Scared

Don't Hug Me I'm Scared is a British surrealist musical black comedy psychological horror web and television series created by filmmakers Becky Sloan and Joseph Pelling. The series consists of six episodes, released from from 29 July 2011 to 19 June 2016, through the artists' websites, YouTube and Vimeo. The series combines segments in live action, puppetry, traditional animation, flash animation, clay animation, stop motion, and computer animation. 

Each episodes starts like a typical children's series, consisting of anthropomorphic puppets akin to those featured in Sesame Street and other popular children's televison series. The series parodies and satirizes these TV programmes by contrasting this childlike, colourful envircreaonment and its inhabitants against disturbing themes; each episode features a surreal plot twist in the climax, including psychedelic content and imagery involving graphic violence, dark humour, shock value, and existentialism and psychological horror. The six episodes explore and discuss the subjects of creativity, time, love, technology, diet, and dreams.


The creators, Sloan and Pelling, met at a university where they started a collective known as "THIS IS IT". After producing the series' first episode with no budget, they thought of making it into a series, but later decided not to after creating the first episode.

However, it gained popularity, and so, they started a fundraising campaign on Kickstarter to make new episodes. YouTuber Thomas Ridgewell then joined the series after donating.

Nongshaba

Nongshaba or Nongsaba () is a Lion God in Meitei religion (Sanamahism) and mythology. He is also the king of the gods. He made light for the world. He made the sun. He is worshipped by the people of both the Ningthouja clans as well as the Moirang clans. God Nongshaba is worshipped in Moirang as the father of God Thangching (Thangjing).
He is the most powerful and important of the Umang Lais () in Ancient Kangleipak (early Manipur). He made his only son Thangching (Thangjing) the king of Moirang.

The culture of God Nongsaba (Nongshaba) was brought from Moirang, to Meitei King Khagemba (). Two people, Mungyaang Ngairaangba and Yumnaam Tonba, brought the worship of Nongshaba to Moirang.

During the reign of King Khagemba () (r. 1597-1652 AD), worshippers began to think of Nongsaba as the King of the gods. God Nongsaba was recognised as an Umang Lai. The people built a temple.

With this, other Umang Lai gods and goddesses became lower ranking gods and goddesses. During this time, a Meitei family named "Leithangbam" managed the temple of Nongsaba. "Phura" was a group of maibis . They worship God Nongsaba.

During the time of Meitei king Paikhomba (), there was a religious marriage ceremony of princess Yaosombi () and God Nongsaba. In the event, an elephant was offered to the god. From the time of King Khagemba until the time of King Charairongba, God Nongsaba was more popular than God Sanamahi.

During the time of King Garibniwaz (), on the 12th of November 1723, Brahmins (priests of Hinduism) started controlling the temples of Nongsaba (Nongshaba) and Yimthei Lai, Panthoibi and Taibangkhaiba (Sanamahi).

After 1726 AD, the culture of worshipping God Nongsaba did not survive for a long time. His worshipping culture was replaced by the different gods and goddesses of Hinduism.
On 17 October 1732, King Garibniwaz () and his teacher Shantidas Gosai closed the temples of Nongshaba as well as Sanamahi, Yumtheilai, Panthoibi, and other Umang Lais.

According to the Meitei mythology, Kangla Sha is another form of God Nongshaba.

According to the "Nongshaba Laihui" ("Nongsaba Laihui") book, God Nongsaba (Nongshaba) is the second son of the Universal God. He is also known as ""Tholbu Chinglen Nongdai Ningthou"". According to the book, God Nongsaba doesn't have much duty or any big role in the creation of the universe. Unlike his younger brother Pakhangba, Nongsaba did not disturb his elder brother Asheeba (alias Sanamahi). He stayed away from disturbing Asheeba.

Unlike his younger brother Pakhangba, Nongsaba does not have any human children. Unlike his elder brother Sanamahi, Nongsaba does not have any human forms. These are mentioned in the Meitei language books, the Pakhangba Laihui and the Sanamahi Laihui.

The Nongsaba Laihui (Nongshaba Laihui) describes the greatness of God Nongsaba (Nongshaba) as follows:
The "Nongsaba Laihui" book also says about God Nongsaba (Nongshaba) as follows:

The book says that all the Umang Lai gods and goddesses (including Sanamahi) are junior of God Nongsaba (Nongshaba).

According to Dr. Saroj Nalini Arambam Parratt, the second lines of the Meitei poem "Anoirol" mentions many sky deities. In the song, Nongshaba is said to be the god of the sky of Moirang. This song is sung in the Lai Haraoba, .

People who worship Nongshaba give him white clothes, fruit, flowers, white fish (preferably "Sareng" ()) and other clothes. These are the same types of gifts that people offer to Pakhangba and Yumjao Lairembi (Yumjao Leima).

In early times, God Nongshaba was worshipped along with Pakhangba, in the "Naoshumshang" (). The God gives long life to the Meitei kings.

In "Khoibaching", Manipur, a round shaped stone is worshipped as God Nongshaba. The holy place is protected by the kings. It was worshipped by the kings only. It is 6 cubits deep.

According to Meitei culture, the "Phura" is a group of the maibis . They take care of the temples of God Nongshaba.

In Meitei cultural clothes, the design of the "Ningkham" and the "Samjin" shows God Nongshaba.
The "Samjin" shows the head of God Nongshaba. The "Ningkham" shows the tail of God Nongshaba.
The head of God Nongshaba is similar to that of the unicorn. It is shown in the "head cloth". It is shown by the curved decorated stick raising up at its top.
The two ears of God Nongshaba are shown by the fan like clothes on the two sides of the head cloth.
The beard of God Nongshaba is shown by the long and narrow line of a decorative cloth. That cloth is hung loosely on the chest.
The designed body of God Nongshaba is shown by the Khamen Chatpa cloth.
The tail of God Nongshaba is shown by the "Ningkham" on the belt worn round the waist.

Meitei kings built many temples for Meitei gods and goddesses in Bangladesh. Among many, there is also a temple of God Nongshaba. In the Manipuri Rajbari in Lama Bazar of Bangladesh, the temple of God Nongshaba was built along with the temples of God Pakhangba and Goddess Yumjao Lairembi. Its architecture is similar to that of Goddess Yumjao Lairembi. The Temple's front door faces South. It is square in shape. It covers an area of 2.40 sq. meters.

On the 15th of December 2015 in Imphal, "Nongsaba" (magazine) was published under the aim "Journalism for change". It is about the social, political, economic, educational, cultural, scientific topics.



Hurrem Sultan

Hurrem Sultan (), also known as Roxelana (1502/10/27 - 15 April 1558), was one of the most popular Slavic women. She was important both for Ottoman Empire and Slavic nations. She was taken by the Tatars and was brought as a gift to Suleiman the Magnificent, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Then she became part of his harem and later his wife. Her real name and place of birth are unknown. Polish state her name was Alexandra, but in Ukrainian literature she is presented as Anastasia.

People say different things about her personality. Some think she was patriotic and did a lot for her nation. Others are sure she was mean and selfish.

Roxelana was born in Rohatyn located in western Ukraine. 

According to Samuel Tvardovskyi's poem "The Great Embassy" (written between 1621 and 1623, published in 1633), she was the daughter of an Orthodox priest from Rohatyn (his last name - Lisovskyi- appeared later in artistic works).
According to the version of the Polish poet Mauritsius Goslavskyi, Roksolana comes from the town of Chemerivtsi (Khmelnytskyi region in Ukraine).

During the reign of Selim I (between the 1510s to 1520), Crimean Tatars took her during one of their Crimean–Nogai slave raids in Eastern Europe. In Istanbul, she was chosen as a gift for Suleiman. Later Hurrem became a favorite of Suleiman in the Ottoman imperial harem.

Hurrem was described as a attractive woman, who was different from everybody else because of her red hair. She also was intelligent and had a pleasant personality. She loved poetry very much. It is considered it was one of the reasons why Suleiman liked her more. He also admired reading poems.

Hurrem was also known for being generous. She built a lot of religious, cultural and resting places for pilgrims travelling to the Islamic city of Mecca. Her greatest charity work was the Great Wall of Jerusalem, a large soup kitchen that fed the poor.

Critics also state that Hurrem was a selfish, manipulative and angry woman who would kill anyone who stood in her way. Even despite her charity, many people still believe she was not kind.

Pavlo Zahrebelnyi described Hurrem as ""an intelligent, kind, understanding, openhearted, candid, talented, generous, emotional and grateful woman who cares about the soul rather than the body; in short, a perfect woman"".

She had 6 children with Suleiman — 5 sons and a daughter, Mihrimah.

2020–21 UEFA Champions League

The 2020–21 UEFA Champions League is the 66th season of the UEFA Champions League.

The final will be played at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey. The stadium was originally suppose to host the 2020 UEFA Champions League Final, but this was moved due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. However, UEFA is moved to Portgual. The winners of the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League will automatically qualify for the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League group stage, and will also play against the winners of the 2020–21 UEFA Europa League in the 2021 UEFA Super Cup. They will also qualify for the 2021 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan.

Bayern Munich are holding the current title, but was eliminated in the quarter-finals by Paris Saint-Germain. Paris Saint-Germain was the opponent whom Bayern Munich defeated in the previous final.

A total of 79 teams from 54 of the 55 UEFA member associations participate in the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League (the exception being Liechtenstein, which does not organise a domestic league). The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients is used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:


The following is the access list for this season.

Changes were made to the default access list since the Champions League title holders, Bayern Munich, and the Europa League title holders, Sevilla, which were guaranteed berths in the Champions League group stage, already qualified for the Champions League group stage via their domestic leagues. However, as a result of schedule delays to both the 2019–20 and 2020–21 European seasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020–21 European season started before the conclusion of the 2019–20 European season. Therefore, the changes to the access list that should be made based on the Champions League and Europa League title holders could not be certain until matches of the earlier qualifying rounds had been played and/or their draws had been made. UEFA used "adaptive re-balancing" to change the access list once the berths for the Champions League and Europa League title holders were determined, and rounds which had already been drawn or played by the time the title holders were determined would not be impacted (Regulations Article 3.04). The following changes were made:


In early April 2020, UEFA announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, the deadline for entering the tournament had been postponed until further notice. UEFA also sent a letter to all member associations that domestic leagues must be completed in full without ending prematurely in order to qualify for European competitions. After meeting with the 55 UEFA associations on 21 April 2020, UEFA strongly recommended them to finish domestic top league and cup competitions, although in some special cases where it is not possible, UEFA would develop guidelines concerning participation in its club competitions in case of a cancelled league or cup. After the UEFA Executive Committee meeting on 23 April 2020, UEFA announced that if a domestic competition is prematurely terminated for legitimate reasons in accordance with conditions related to public health or economic problems, the national associations concerned are required to select their participating teams for the 2020–21 UEFA club competitions based on sporting merit in the 2019–20 domestic competitions, and UEFA reserves the right to refuse their admission if UEFA deems the termination of the competitions not legitimate, or the selection procedure not objective, transparent and non-discriminatory, or the team is perceived by the public as qualifying unfairly. A suspended domestic competition may also be restarted with a different format from the original one in a manner which would still facilitate qualification on sporting merit. All leagues should communicate to UEFA by 25 May 2020 whether they intend to restart their competitions, but this deadline was later extended. On 17 June 2020, UEFA announced that associations must enter their teams by 3 August 2020.

The labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round:


The second qualifying round, third qualifying round and play-off round are divided into Champions Path (CH) and League Path (LP).

Notes

The schedule of the competition is as follows (all draws are held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland unless otherwise stated). The tournament would originally have started in June 2020, but had been delayed to August due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. The new schedule was announced by the UEFA Executive Committee on 17 June 2020. All qualifying matches, excluding the play-off round, were played as single leg matches, hosted by one of the teams decided by draw (except the preliminary round which was played at neutral venue).

The group stage draw was originally to be held at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center in Athens, Greece, but UEFA announced on 9 September 2020 that it would be relocated to Nyon, but it was eventually held at nearby Geneva.

The original schedule of the competition, as planned before the pandemic, was as follows (all draws held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, unless stated otherwise).

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, the following special rules are applicable to the competition:


On 24 September 2020, UEFA announced that five substitutions would be permitted from the group stage onward, with a sixth allowed in extra time. However, each team is only given three opportunities to make substitutions during matches, with a fourth opportunity in extra time, excluding substitutions made at half-time, before the start of extra time and at half-time in extra time. Consequently, a maximum of twelve players can be listed on the substitute bench.

All qualifying matches were played behind closed doors. Following the partial return of fans at the 2020 UEFA Super Cup, UEFA announced on 1 October 2020 that matches from the group stage onward could be played at 30% capacity if allowed by the local authorities.

The draw for the first qualifying round was held on 9 August 2020, 12:00 CEST. The matches were played on 18 and 19 August 2020. The match between KÍ and Slovan Bratislava was cancelled due to Slovan Bratislava players being put into quarantine after one player had tested positive for coronavirus, and KÍ were awarded a technical 3–0 win.

<section end=Q1 />

The draw for the second qualifying round was held on 10 August 2020, 12:00 CEST. The matches were played on 25 and 26 August 2020.

The losers of League Path entered the 2020–21 UEFA Europa League third qualifying round (Main Path).

The losers of Champions Path entered the 2020–21 UEFA Europa League play-off round (Champions Path). The losers of League Path entered the 2020–21 UEFA Europa League group stage.

The losers of both Champions Path and League Path entered the 2020–21 UEFA Europa League group stage.

A total of 32 teams play in the group stage, from 15 countries: 26 teams which entered in this stage, and the six winners of the play-off round (four from Champions Path, two from League Path).

The draw for the group stage was held on 1 October 2020, 17:00 CEST, at the RTS Studios in Geneva, Switzerland. The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, with the restriction that teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots based on the following principles (introduced starting 2015–16 season):


In each group, teams play against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The group winners and runners-up advance to the round of 16, while the third-placed teams enter the 2020–21 UEFA Europa League round of 32.

İstanbul Başakşehir, Krasnodar, Midtjylland and Rennes made their debut appearances in the group stage. With İstanbul Başakşehir's appearance in the group stage, Istanbul became the first city that has been represented in the group stage by four different teams (had been previously represented by Beşiktaş, Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray). This season became the first in the history of the Champions League in which three Russian clubs will play in the group stage.

In the knockout phase, teams played against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final.

Statistics exclude qualifying rounds and play-off round.

The UEFA technical study group selected the following 23 players as the squad of the tournament.



Dendropsophus leucophyllatus

The white-leaf tree frog, clown tree frog or Beireis's tree frog ("Dendropsophus leucophyllatus") is a frog that lives in Brazil, Surinam, Guyana, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and French Guiana. Scientists have seen it as high as 400 meters above sea level. Scientists think it might also leave nearby in Venezuela.

Poubi Lai

"Poubi Lai" also known as "Paubi Loi", was an ancient dragon python, who dwelled in the Loktak Lake of Manipur, in Meitei mythology and folklore. It is also refered to as ""Loch Ness Monster of Manipur"".

In the Loktak lake, the spirit of Poubi Lai was awakened by the fishing activities of the fishermen of Moirang. Being angered, Poubi Lai destroyed many human habitats and killed many people. It decided to destroy the whole Moirang kingdom. He threatened the King of Ancient Moirang to offer him one Shangbai (basket) of rice and one human everyday. The circumstance was sorrowful for the people of Moirang. Every household had to provide the offer turn by turn. When it was the turn of a young man, the lad seeked help from "Kabui Salang Maiba" (or ""Kabui Tomba""). The maiba was a shaman priest king of Kabui tribe in the Salangthel hill range of the Loktak lake. He promised to save the kingdom from the gigantic evil creature. He transformed a Tou plant ("an aquatic plant") (or a "Khok Waa" bamboo plant in another version) into a powerful ""Long"" (a 9 pointed javelin). Later, the maiba slayed Poubi Lai with the deadly weapon.

In 2002, Karam Dineshwar, an artisan had a dream. In his dream, Poubi Lai asked him to craft its image. In the next day, he came across a big tree root at Leimatak. He completed making the 21 feet long wooden sculpture of Poubi Lai in the next 6 months.

The artwork of Poubi Lai was first exhibited in the Manipur State Museum, Manipur in 2002. Next, it was exhibited in the National Museum, New Delhi and later in the Quai Branly Museum, Paris, France in 2010. It was also received by the Indian Museum, Kolkata, the largest in India.

In 2015, the National Museum, New Delhi organized an exhibition of the wooden sculpture of Poubi Lai for 42 days. The carving belongs to the permanent collection of the Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sangrahlaya (IGRMS), Bhopal. The object was declared as an "Object of National Importance". It was registered under "AA" Category of the Museum Collections.

During the exhibition at Bhopal, 25 artists of Centre for Youth and Cultural Activities from Imphal, performed a dance drama on the story of Poubi Lai.

Marge and a marine biologist try to keep manatees safe from jet skis.

Alec Baldwin is a guest star as Dr. Thorn (the marine biologist). The episode's story was one of the ideas for the story of "The Simpsons Movie". Al Jean wanted the movie to be about the Simpson family saving manatees. The idea was made into this episode instead. About 11.1 milion people watched the episode when it was first broadcast. The episode shows the Denver Broncos winning the Super Bowl over the Seattle Seahawks. The teams later played at Super Bowl XLVIII, but the Seahawks won the real game.

2020–21 UEFA Champions League knockout phase

The 2020–21 UEFA Champions League knockout phase began on 16 February with the round of 16 and will end on 29 May 2021 with the final at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey, to decide the champions of the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League. A total of 16 teams compete in the knockout phase.

Times are CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).

The knockout phase involves the 16 teams which qualify as winners and runners-up of each of the eight groups in the group stage. <section begin="Qualified" teams="" />

<section end="Qualified" teams="" />

Each tie in the knockout phase, apart from the final, is played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scores more goals on aggregate over the two legs advances to the next round. If the aggregate score is level, the away goals rule is applied, i.e. the team that scores more goals away from home over the two legs advances. If away goals are also equal, then extra time is played. The away goals rule is again applied after extra time, i.e. if there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team advances by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals are scored during extra time, the winners are decided by a penalty shoot-out. In the final, which is played as a single match, if the score is level at the end of normal time, extra time is played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the score is still level. <section begin="Format" /> The mechanism of the draws for each round is as follows:


For the quarter-finals and semi-finals, teams from the same city are not scheduled to play at home on the same day or on consecutive days, due to logistics and crowd control. To avoid such scheduling conflict, if the two teams are drawn to play at home for the same leg, the order of legs of the tie involving the team with the lower domestic ranking in the qualifying season is reversed from the original draw.

The schedule is as follows (all draws are held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland).

2020–21 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round

The 2020–21 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round began on 8 August and ended on 30 September 2020.

A total of 53 teams competed in the qualifying system of the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League, which includes the qualifying phase and the play-off round, with 43 teams in Champions Path and 10 teams in League Path. The six winners in the play-off round (four from Champions Path, two from League Path) advanced to the group stage, to join the 26 teams that enter in the group stage.

Times are CEST (), as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).

The Champions Path includes all league champions which do not qualify directly for the group stage, and consists of the following rounds:

All teams eliminated from the Champions Path enter the Europa League:

Below are the participating teams of the Champions Path (with their 2020 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their starting rounds.

The League Path includes all league non-champions which do not qualify directly for the group stage, and consists of the following rounds:

All teams eliminated from the League Path enter the Europa League:

Below are the participating teams of the League Path (with their 2020 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their starting rounds.

In a change to the format as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, each tie prior to the play-off round is played as a single-legged match hosted by one of the teams decided by draw, except for the preliminary round which is played at neutral venue. If scores are level at the end of normal time, extra time is played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the scores remain tied.

The play-off round ties are played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scores more goals on aggregate over the two legs advances to the next round. If the aggregate score is level, the away goals rule is applied, i.e. the team that scores more goals away from home over the two legs advances. If away goals are also equal, then extra time is played. The away goals rule is again applied after extra time, i.e. if there are goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score is still level, the visiting team advances by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals are scored during extra time, the tie is decided by a penalty shoot-out.

In each draw, teams are seeded based on their 2020 UEFA club coefficients. For any team whose club coefficients are not final at the time of a draw, their club coefficients at that time, taking into account of all 2019–20 UEFA Champions League and Europa League matches played up to that point, are used (Regulations Article 13.03). Teams are divided into seeded and unseeded pots containing the same number of teams, and a seeded team is drawn against an unseeded team. For each tie, a draw is made between the two teams, and the first team drawn is the home team in single-legged matches (or the administrative "home" team in preliminary round matches), or home team of the first leg in play-off round two-legged ties. If the identity of the winners of the previous round is not known at the time of the draws, the seeding is carried out under the assumption that the team with the higher coefficient of an undecided tie advances to this round, which means if the team with the lower coefficient is to advance, it simply takes the seeding of its opponent. Teams from associations with political conflicts as decided by UEFA may not be drawn into the same tie. Prior to the draws, UEFA may form "groups" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee and based on geographical, logistical and political reasons, and they are purely for convenience of the draw and do not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, all qualifying matches are played behind closed doors. The following special rules are applicable to the qualifying phase and play-offs:


Four countries (Poland, Hungary, Greece and Cyprus) have provided neutral venue hubs which allow matches to be played at their stadiums without restrictions.

The schedule of the competition is as follows (all draws are held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland). The tournament would originally have started in June 2020, but had been delayed to August due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. The new schedule was announced by the UEFA Executive Committee on 17 June 2020.

The original schedule of the competition, as planned before the pandemic, was as follows (all draws held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, unless stated otherwise).
<section begin=PR />
The draw for the preliminary round was held on 17 July 2020, 12:00 CEST.<section end=PR />

A total of four teams played in the preliminary round. As the draw was held before the UEFA entry deadline and the participating teams were not yet confirmed, only the associations of the teams were used, and seeding of teams was based on their association coefficients instead of their club coefficients. For the semi-final round, two teams (from associations 52 and 53, Northern Ireland and Kosovo) were seeded and two teams (from associations 54 and 55, Andorra and San Marino) were unseeded. The first team drawn in each tie in the semi-final round and the final round would be the administrative "home" team.

<section begin=PR />
The semi-finals were played on 8 August at the Colovray Stadium in Nyon, Switzerland.

2021–22 UEFA Champions League

The 2021–22 UEFA Champions League was the 67th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA.

Real Madrid defeated Liverpool 1–0 in the final, which was played at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, France, for a record-extending 14th title, and their fifth in nine years. It was originally scheduled to be played at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany. However, due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final, the final hosts were moved back a year, with Saint Petersburg scheduled to host the 2022 final. Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the final was eventually moved to Saint-Denis. As the winners, Real Madrid automatically qualified for the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League group stage, and also earned the right to play against the winners of the 2021–22 UEFA Europa League, Eintracht Frankfurt, in the 2022 UEFA Super Cup. Additionally, the winners typically qualify for the annual FIFA Club World Cup. However, the tournament's status remains uncertain, following FIFA's proposal for a format improvement. Chelsea were the defending champions, but were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Real Madrid.

This season was the first since 1999–2000 (the first season after the end of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup) where three major European club competitions (UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and the newly created UEFA Europa Conference League) are organised by UEFA. No changes were made to the format of the Champions League, but teams that were eliminated from the preliminary round and first qualifying round of the Champions League were now transferred to the Europa Conference League instead of the Europa League.

On 24 June 2021, UEFA approved the proposal to remove the away goals rule in all UEFA club competitions, which had been used since 1965. If in a two-legged tie two teams scored the same number of aggregate goals, the winner of the tie would not be decided by the number of away goals scored by each team but always by 30 minutes of extra time, and if the two teams scored the same amount of goals in extra time, the winner would be decided by a penalty shoot-out.

A total of 80 teams from 54 of the 55 UEFA member associations participated in the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League (the exception being Liechtenstein, which did not organise a domestic league). The association ranking based on the UEFA association coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:

For the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2020 UEFA association coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2015–16 to 2019–20.

Apart from the allocation based on the association coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Champions League, as noted below:

The following is the access list for this season. As the Champions League title holders, Chelsea, which were guaranteed a berth in the Champions League group stage, already qualified via their domestic league (as fourth place in the 2020-21 Premier League), the following changes to the access list were made:

The labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round:

The second qualifying round, third qualifying round and play-off round were divided into Champions Path (CH) and League Path (LP).

Notes

All matches were played on Tuesdays and Wednesdays apart from the preliminary round final, which was played on a Friday, and the final, which was played on a Saturday. The third qualifying round second legs were only played on a Tuesday due to the 2021 UEFA Super Cup on the following Wednesday. Scheduled kick-off times starting from the play-off round were 18:45 (instead of 18:55 previously) and 21:00 CEST/CET.

All draws were held at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, except the group stage draw, which took place in Istanbul, Turkey, on 26 August 2021.

The draw for the group stage was held in Istanbul, Turkey, on 26 August 2021. The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots, each of eight teams, based on the following principles:
Teams from the same association, and due to political reasons, teams from Ukraine and Russia, could not be drawn into the same group. Before the draw, UEFA formed pairings of teams from the same association (one pairing for associations with two or three teams, two pairings for associations with four or five teams) based on television audiences, where one team was drawn into Groups A–D and another team was drawn into Groups E–H, so that the two teams would play on different days.

The matches were played on 14–15 September, 28–29 September, 19–20 October, 2–3 November, 23–24 November, and 7–9 December 2021. The top two teams of each group advanced to the round of 16. The third-placed teams were transferred to the Europa League knockout round play-offs, while the fourth-placed teams were eliminated from European competitions for the season.

Sheriff Tiraspol made their debut appearance in the group stage. They were the first team from Moldova to play in the Champions League group stage.
In the knockout phase, teams played against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final.

Statistics exclude qualifying rounds and play-off round.

Plan Challe

Plan Challe or Challe Plan was a French military operation during the Algerian War. General Maurice Challe had the idea for the Challe Plan. It lasted from 6 February 1959 - 6 April 1961.

In Plan Challe, the French Army attacked the FLN fighters. The French sent reserve units and conscript units to defend places in which they would not have to be moblie such as to protect roads. That way, regular French army units could perform search and destroy missions in the mountains, where guerrilla fighters were hiding. The army used helicopters to move special mobile units composed of elite troops such as Foreign Legionnaires, paratroopers, marines, special commandos units, and air mobile regulars. The elite forces never exceeded more than 20,000 soldiers.

Plan Challe was a series of sweeps into places in which the French army knew guerrilla fighters were hiding. By taking regular troops away from defence, Challe broke down large formations into small units, many of which had both French soldiers and Algerian soldiers in them. The groups of soldiers could move quickly so that the guerrillas had to fight them in rough country.

"The highly sophisticated operational and tactical scenario was virtually the same. Utilizing primarily air-gathered intelligence and without warning, the elite units and the air force move at tremendous speed onto enemy territory. The strike usually takes place at dawn. First, the target area is bombed out of existence and showered with cluster bombs from fighter jets and bombers. Within few minutes, the paratroopers land in the heart of the insurgent territory with close air support provided by armed helicopters. The elite force engages immediately the insurgents while fighters, bombers, armed helicopters patrolled the battle space and strafe or bomb any insurgents leaving the area. Additional troops are brought in by helicopters to close the immediate net around the insurgents. A larger contingent of regular troops and Commandos de chasse (hunter class troops) are convoyed to several spots around the battle space to ambush and pursue the survivors. The aircraft are relieved when the area is under control by the elite troops and when the regular contingent is in place. The command and control post (Joint Operations Command) is always shared by Air Force and Army commanders. The operation is dismantled at sundown and the elite troops are withdrawn leaving the local (secteur) regular troop to finish the job and keep the area clean. It was devastating to the FLN, in terms of lives and moral."

Plan Challe was a clear military victory for France. The FLN had only around 5,000 soldiers left because many of them had fled from Algeria to nearby countries like Morocco and Tunisia, where the FLN leadership was based. The fighters that did not flee Algeria were forced into hiding because the French military presence was overwhelming.

Plan Challe helped France to win the Algerian War militarily and led to Charles de Gaulle on 29 June 1961 announcing on live television that fighting in Algeria was virtually over. The military side of the conflict in Algeria had almost ended, but the political side of the conflict would continue.

For the round of 32, since both teams were drawn to play at home for the second leg, the home match of the team which were not domestic cup champions in the qualifying season, or the team with the lower domestic ranking (if neither team were the domestic cup champions, e.g. Tottenham Hotspur for this season), were moved from Thursday to a different day. For the round of 16, quarter-finals and semi-finals, if the two teams were drawn to play at home for the same leg, the order of legs of the tie involving the team which were not domestic cup champions in the qualifying season, or the team with the lower domestic ranking, will be reversed from the original draw.

The schedule is as follows (all draws are held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland).

2020 UEFA Super Cup

The 2020 UEFA Super Cup was the 45th edition of the UEFA Super Cup. The match featured Bayern Munich, the winners of the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, and Sevilla, the winners of the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League. It was played at the Puskás Aréna in Budapest, Hungary on 24 September 2020.

The match was originally scheduled to be played at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto, Portugal, on 12 August 2020; however, after the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe caused the schedule to change of the previous season's club finals. The UEFA Executive Committee chose to award the rescheduled Champions League final to Portugal, and postponed and relocated the Super Cup to Budapest.

Bayern Munich won the match 2–1 after extra time to secure their second UEFA Super Cup title.

The Estádio do Dragão was scheduled to stage its first ever UEFA Super Cup match.

This was the first UEFA club competition final hosted at the Puskás Aréna and the second for Budapest and Hungary.

An open bidding process was launched on 8 December 2017 by UEFA to select the venue of the UEFA Super Cup in 2020. Associations had until 12 January 2018 to express interest, and bid dossiers had to be submitted by 29 March 2018. Associations hosting matches at UEFA Euro 2020 were not allowed to bid for the 2020 UEFA Super Cup.

The UEFA Executive Committee relocated the match to Puskás Aréna in Budapest at their meeting on 17 June 2020.

Tickets were on sale for the general public until 9 September 2020. Moreover, 3,000 tickets were available for the supporters of each team. In total, 15,500 tickets were sold. Strict hygiene measures, including social distancing and wearing of face masks when social distancing could not be respected, were in place during the match. Ticket holders from overseas had to present proof of a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test performed within three days of entry, and had to leave the country within 72 hours after their entry.

Despite Hungarian government insisting that the match would be safe to attend, there was opposition to the decision to have spectators. Hungarian politician Ildikó Borbély called the game an "unacceptable experiment", while Minister President of Bavaria Markus Söder urged Bayern fans not to travel, fearing that the match could turn into a "hotbed for COVID-19 to spread". Hungarian Medical Chamber advisor, epidemiologist András Csilek, stated that the Chamber also considered it wrong, saying that it "carries unnecessary risk adding" and "shouldn't be allowed".

On 15 September 2020, UEFA named English official Anthony Taylor as the referee for the match. Taylor had been a FIFA referee since 2013, and previously worked as one of the additional assistant referees in the 2014 UEFA Super Cup, 2015 UEFA Europa League Final, 2016 UEFA Champions League Final and UEFA Euro 2016 Final. He was joined by his fellow countrymen, with Gary Beswick and Adam Nunn as assistant referees, Stuart Attwell as the video assistant referee (VAR) and Paul Tierney as the assistant VAR. Israeli referee Orel Grinfeld served as the fourth official.

Sevilla were awarded a penalty after 13 minutes when Ivan Rakitić was blocked and bundled over in the penalty area by David Alaba. Lucas Ocampos scored the penalty shooting to the left corner to put Sevilla ahead. Leon Goretzka made it 1–1 in the 34th minute, with a side foot finish to the left corner of the net after a take down assist from Robert Lewandowski. The game went into extra time, with substitute Javi Martínez getting the winner for Bayern in the 104th minute with a powerful header to the top left corner of the net when the ball fell to him, after Sevilla goalkeeper Yassine Bounou had punched the ball back into play.

The Champions League winners was designated as the "home" team for administrative purposes.<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>

Nokia 3310 (2017)

"This is about the 2017 Nokia 3310. For the original, see Nokia 3310"

Nokia 3310 (2017) is a smartphone that is a remodel of the Nokia 3310. It is also known as the Nokia 3310 (2017 Edition). It was announced on February 26, 2017, in the Mobile World Congress at Barcelona as the Nokia 3310 2017 Edition, debuting as a 2G smartphone. Nokia released the 3G model on October 29, 2017.

On February 14, 2017, it was reported that a newer version of the 3310 would be released at the 2017 Mobile World Congress that is held in Barcelona by HMD Global Oy, a Finnish manufacturer which made Nokia phones. The price was set to be 59 euros. On the 26th, the phone was relaunched at 49 euros.

The first release of the phone only came with 2G support, which led to issues, especially as countries like the United States, Australia and Singapore were in the process of phasing out their 2G networks. A new version of the phone with support for 3G networks was later announced by HMD, and released on 29 October 2017.

The 3310 has things like an FM radio, the Opera Mini web browser, a voice recorder, and a 2-megapixel camera with flash for photos and video recording. The flash LED is also the phone's flashlight. Some models have Bluetooth 3.0 and a dual-SIM tray. The display has a polarized layer for outdoor use.

The original "Snake" game has been replaced by Gameloft's "Snake Xenzia" with updated modes and graphics. It is also possible to sideload Java-based applications using the .jad and .jar format. Available apps are browsers, games, internet radios, etc.

The design of the phone is very similar to the Nokia 3310. It comes in two glossy colors, red and yellow, as well as two matte colors similar to the original Nokia 3310: dark blue and grey.

The 3G model has many differences apart from the 3G radio. The internal storage has been increased from 16 megabytes to 128 megabytes, and there are some cosmetic changes, including a new silver keypad. It comes in four new colors: yellow, "warm" red, azure and charcoal, all matte. The phone's size has slightly increased to make typing on the keypad easier. The radio has reduced battery talk time, but slightly increased standby time. All 3310 3G versions support Bluetooth 2.1.

The 3310 3G also runs a Java-based operating system that HMD calls "Smart Feature OS". Its appearance is similar to the Series 30+ as on the 2G version, but has a new customizable interface. However, only sim-slot 1 is 3G compatible, the slot 2 is still only 2G capable.

A 4G version was released in January 2018 in China in a partnership with China Mobile. It runs AliOS, a fork of Android, and can create Wi-Fi hotspots using the LTE data connection. Internal storage has been increased to 512 megabytes, and 64 gigabyte memory cards are now supported.

HMD announced on 2 July 2017 that the 3310 received great demand and was as a result sold out in many markets. UK retailer Carphone Warehouse said on 10 March that demand was "astonishing".

The new 3310 received mixed reviews. CNET praised the phone's battery life, price, and durability, but "Techradar" and "The Guardian" said the device doesn't have many features that modern smartphones users are used to. Most reviewers liked the nostalgia of playing the iconic Snake game.

Some counterfeit versions of the phone have been produced due to the model's popularity.

Ship of Theseus

The ship of Theseus is a question about if you can consider that an object is the same one when you replace parts of it. It is a paradox.

For example, if you have an axe and you replace its handle, it is still the same axe? And if you replace the blade? And if you made another axe with the old handle and blade, the "real" axe is the one that has the replaced elements or the one that has the old ones?

Different people answer this question in different ways.

The name comes from a legend about ancient hero Theseus.

Liver (food)

Liver is a food which humans can eat. It is offal, which means it is not muscle tissue. The flavor might be strong for some people, so it might be slightly over-seasoned.Do not consume too much liver or your feet will start to peel and rot. They will look like you roller bladed without socks for weeks. There is a high probability you might lose your foot and have to enter the war amps program. 

The liver stores vitamin A and other things. Vitamin A is used by the body to make rhodopsin, a molecule which absorbs light. It is needed for low-level vision and colour vision. Vitamin A also plays a key role in gene transcription. It also plays a key role in the immune system.

Once made, vitamin A cannot be broken down by the body, and it is not easily excreted. So it tends to build up in the liver if too much is eaten. Vitamin A is fat-soluble, so getting rid of any excess taken in through diet takes much longer than with water-soluble B vitamins and vitamin C. This allows for toxic levels of vitamin A to build up.

It is not good to eat cooked liver too often. Eating lots of liver, especially from carnivorous animals, will give a person too much vitamin A.

Edge effects (ecology)

In ecology, edge effects are changes in population or community structures that occur at the border of two or more places of living. As the edge effects get bigger, there is greater biodiversity in the habitat at the border.


Height can create borders between patches as well.

Some plants and animals can be active on habitat borders because of environmental conditions. Larger patches allow more individuals and biodiversity becomes bigger. When the plants get more light, there are more types and different sizes. After it is possible to live for herbivorous insects, then birds some bigger animals. 

There are three important factors: 
Human activity creates edges through development and agriculture. Often, the changes are harmful to the size of the habitat and to species. Examples of human impacts:

Hessian dialects

Hessian (German: "Hessisch") is a group of German dialects, characterized as a Central German dialect according to its share in the High German sound shift and spoken mainly in Hesse, but also in some areas in Franconia, Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia.

Hessian, together with Palatine on the one hand and a mixed area between Hessian, Palatine, South Franconian (""Badisch"") and East Franconian in the Rhine-Main-Neckar area on the other hand, forms the Rhine Franconian. Lorraine Franconian is also partially counted as part of Rhine Franconian.

The absence of the transition from "p" > "(p)f" (Appel for "apple", German: "Apfel") marks Rhine Franconian, together with Moselle Franconian and Ripuarian, as a West Central German dialect.

"Hessian" in the sense of the traditional dialect is not to be confused with the modern New Hessian regiolect.

The distribution area of Hessian dialects occupies the state of Hesse except for the extreme north and northeast, part of Rhineland-Palatinate (Westerwald, Rhenish Hesse, Taunus), North Rhine-Westphalia (Wittgensteiner Land) and Bavaria (Bavarian Lower Main).

One distinguishes


Linguistic boundaries are the isoglosses "ich" (Hessian) / "ik" (Low German) as well as "machen" (Hessian) / "maken" (Low German) northward to Low Saxon and Westphalian, "Pund" (Hessian) / "Fund" (Thuringian) eastward to Thuringian, "Pund" (Hessian) / "Pfund" (East Franconian) as well as "Appel" (Hessian) / "Apfel" (East Franconian) eastward to East Franconian, "was" (Hessian) / "wat" (Ripuarian/Moselle Franconian) westward to Moselle Franconian and "fest" (Hessian) / "fescht" (Palatine) to the Rhine Franconian/Palatine/East Franconian mixed area southward. As can be seen from the bounding isoglosses, Hessian is subject to the High German sound shift with respect to "t" > "s" and "k" > "ch/h", but unlike East Central German, it does not show the "p" > "f" transition.

The border to the Low German language area is marked by a here spatially very narrowly limited isoglossic bundle - the Benrath line, which here, unlike west and east, is hardly fanned out. This language boundary (or "maken-machen" or "ik-ich" line) between Low German and Central German language varieties or Hessian belongs to the dialect continuum, but it is probably one of the most sharply formed transitional areas in the German language area. In contrast, the border to the south is characterized by particularly wide isoglosses and is correspondingly blurred. The transition to Palatine, to East Franconian and to Thuringian is fluent.

Characteristic is the lack of distinction between voiced and unvoiced "s" or "sch" as well as in South and Central Hessian between "ch" on the one hand and "sch" on the other. All these sounds tend to be pronounced voiced, so that phonetically, for example, there is hardly any difference between "Kirche" and "Kirsche" or between "weiße" and "weise". This leads also in High German partly to hypercorrection ("Kirchbaum" instead of "Kirschbaum").

Hessian is characterized by residual occurrences of particularly ancient words whose root words hardly occur in other dialects or languages, such as "idrecken", "itarucken" for ruminate, "densen", "dinsen" for "to pull at something with all one's might" and ehren "(ähren)" for ackern/plow.

The Hessian vocabulary is documented by three multi-volume dictionaries, the "Südhessisches Wörterbuch" (completed, 6 volumes), the "Hessen-Nassauisches Volkswörterbuch" (in progress), and the "Frankfurter Wörterbuch" (completed, 6 volumes).

From the 19th century come A. G. E. Vilmar's "Idiotikon von Kurhessen" (Marburg/Leipzig 1868) and Hermann von Pfister's "Mundartliche und stammheitliche Nachträge" "zu A. F. C. Vilmar's Idiotikon von Hessen" (Marburg 1886).

South of the Main, the preterite (past tense) is absent and replaced by the perfect (present perfect); north of the Main, on the other hand, preterite forms are common. In the south, standard German is ""ich kam"", i.e., "ich bin kumme", whereas in the north, "ich kåm". A second important, albeit Gemeindeutsch difference to standard German is the replacement of the genitive by prepositional and dative periphrases. Thus, instead of "Georg's book" it is ""des Buch vum Schorsch"" or "em "Schorsch soi Buch"."

Hessian syntax was studied in the 2010s at the Philipps University of Marburg as part of the project "SyHD: Syntax of Hessian Dialects."

German Spaniel

These dogs are usually brown/red coloured and may have some white marks, they have a wavy coat of hair and look very similar to their cousin, the Field Spaniel.

German Spaniels are rarely kept only as pets as these dogs are almost always used as hunting dogs and, like all spaniel hunting dogs, require a lot of excercise. However, they are usually gentle but brave and can make good pets around people and other dogs if trained at a young age.

German Spaniels are quite rare outside of their native country with only around 100 dogs registered in North America as of 2013.

2021 Atlanta spa shootings

The 2021 Atlanta spa shootings happened in suburbs around Atlanta, Georgia in the United States in 2021. A man shot and killed eight people at three spas on March 16, starting just before 5:00 p.m. A suspect, Robert Aaron Long, was caught south of the city that night. The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation and local police are investigating the crime.

Long shot four people at Young's Asian Massage. Two of them died there and two others died later at a hospital. He shot three more people at Gold Spa. He shot another person at Aroma Therapy Massage.

Of the eight people Long shot, seven were women and one was a man. Six of the eight people were Asian women; the other two were white. Four of the people were Koreans or Korean-Americans. Long shot a ninth person, a Hispanic man, but he did not die.

Some of the victims have been identified publicly.

Robert Aaron Long was arrested by police about 150 miles south of Atlanta. Long was 21 years old at the time. He is white. He is from Woodstock, Georgia. People from the Atlanta Police Department say they have video evidence showing Long could be the shooter. The Atlanta Police also say Long confessed to the crime.

Authorities charged Long with eight counts of murder. His church, Crabapple First Baptist Church, threw him out as well.

If authorities believe that Long killed the people because he hates Asians, he could be charged with a hate crime, which means he would spend more time in prison. Georgia passed a hate crime bill in 2020 after the killing of Ahmaud Arbery. The United States has had many more crimes against Asians than usual since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2019. After the spa shootings, many Asian Americans held up signs and posted on the Internet "Stop Asian Hate."

Long told the police that he did not shoot the people because he hates Asians. He said he had sex addiction. The police said he shot the people because he thought of the massage parlors as a place that tempted him to have sex.

In an interview for the media, Captain Jay Baker from the Sheriff's Office said that Long had been having "a really bad day" and was "at the end of his rope" when he shot the people. Many people said this was a bad thing to say because it sounded like he was making excuses for the killer. Sheriff Frank Reynolds apologized: "We regret any heartache Captain Baker's words may have caused."

Kounu

Kounu (, ) is a goddess in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). She is a wife of God Koubru. She is the guardian of the northern direction. Kounu has two homes. Her main home is on Mount Kounu. Her other home is in Mount Koubru, which is where her husband Koubru lives. She is worshipped with Koubru as the deities of the "Khullakpa" (village chief). Kounu and Koubru ruled Ancient Manipur for a very long time after the reign of King Ningthou Puthiba.

Kounu is one of the gods who change climates and weather. Her husband Koubru and her son Loyalakpa are also weather deities. Meitei people believe that if the annual rainfall is good, then it is caused by goddess Kounu. When goddess Kounu changes the climate, there will be hardly any flood. Crop yields are good in Kounu's activities.

Kounu met God Koubru for the first time when she was searching for cotton plants in the western slopes of Mount Koubru. The two fell in love at first sight. Kounu asked Koubru to bring her all kinds of fruit for the marriage proposal. She said she would not agree to marry him if he failed to do so. So, on a Saturday, God Koubru had a meeting with all the gods and goddesses of hills and plains. They all prepared for fruits of all sorts. They planned to proceed to the marriage proposal on the next day, Sunday.

On the next day's before sunrise, goddesses brought the fruits to Kounu's place. Male gods also came with Koubru to the place. The gods found two fruits missing, heikru (Indian gooseberry) and Heining. Then, Kounu rejected the marriage proposal. At this, Koubru told her that she would have a daughter because she had gotten pregnant the last time they had met. Then the other male gods got angry because of Kounu's excessively reserved marriage proposal conditions while she was already conceived. They put a curse on Kounu's baby, saying she would be born on a stone slab on the baby's next incarnation. The goddesses were about to curse the baby to be turned into flower during birth, but they didn't as Kounu had been punished enough. Feeling embarrassed, Kounu also cursed that all the gifts to be turned into stones on the very sunrise. Soon, as the sun rose up, all the gifts turned into stones.

Kounu gave birth to a daughter named "Leisna" ("Laisna, Leisana, Laisana"). When her daughter grew up, she asked Kounu about her father, and Kounu told her. Leisna asked to go to her father's place to meet him. Kounu let her go. On her way, Leisna met Pakhangba. They became lovers. Later, they married. Since Leisna was a mortal, she died when her time of death came.

Goddess Kounu and God Koubru lived together. Once goddess Leimarel Sidabi decided to incarnate herself as the daughter of the two. So, Leimarel incarnated herself into a baby infant girl. On the very day, Kounu and Koubru were walking on a hilly region. God Koubru got very thirsty. He found Kounu's pitcher empty. Unable to bear his thirst, he went down the riverside to drink water. Surprisingly, he found a newly born girl lying on a stone slab of the river bed. Koubru shouted three times if there was anyone for the baby girl. No one responded. So, Koubru and Kounu brought the girl to their abode. The two adopted the girl as their own daughter. They gave her three names. The baby was named "Ipok Leima" ("Eepok Leima") because she was found in the stream. The baby was also named "Thoudu Nungthel Leima" because she was found lying on the stone slab. The baby was given her final name as "Taipang Nganpi" ("Taibang Nganbi") because she was beautiful as well as bright.

Once Kounu was asked by her son Loyalakpa about the true origin of Thoudu Nungthel Leima. Loyalakpa was suspicious if Thoudu Nungthel Leima was really his real sister or not. Koubru had already warned Kounu not to reveal the secret of Thoudu Nungthel Leima to their son. So, at first, Kounu lied to him. But at Loyalakpa's grudge, she decided to tell him the truth. But since both Mother Kounu and Son Loyalakpa were at Koubru's abode, she dared not to speak anything about it. She feared Koubru might heard of it. With permission from Koubru, Kounu and her son Loyalakpa went to her abode. It was the safe place to reveal the truth. Kounu narrated Loyalakpa how she and Koubru found Thoudu Nungthel Leima lying on a stone slab in the river. She revealed that Thoudu Nungthel Leima was actually their adopted daughter and not real by birth. 
Later, Kounu's son Loyalakpa and Kounu's adopted daughter "Thoudu Nungthel Leima" married.

Goddess Kounu and her husband God Koubru are worshipped in many cults and shrines of Manipur. Some are located in Mayang Langjing, Awang Khunnou, Senjam, Chirang, Loitang Khunnou, Tingri, Koutruk, Awang Potsangbam, Sairem Khul, Kameng, Sarouthel, Lairel Sajik, Lairel Kaabi, Heibongpokpi, Nongchup Sanjenbam, Tauthong, Haorang Keithel, Haorang Saabal, Kwak Siphai, Narelkonjin, Thamnapokpi, Awang Sekmai, Leimram, Phumlou Keiroi, Phumlou Siphai, Potsangbam Thouriphi, Samushang, Keinou Thongthak, Khonghampat, Akham, Morok Ingkhol, Lambaal Khul, Phayeng, Haujongban, Awang Keingam, Khurkhul and Leikinthabi.
According to Meitei culture, Goddess Kounu and God Koubru are the protectress and the protector of the said places.

King Baudouin Stadium

The King Baudouin Stadium (, ) is a sports stadium in the Heysel section of Brussels, Belgium.

The original name of the stadium was the Jubilee Stadium (, ). This is because it was inaugurated days after Belgium's 100th anniversary, with an unofficial Belgium-Netherlands football match. In 1946 the stadium was renamed Heysel Stadium (French: "Stade du Heysel", Dutch: "Heizelstadion"), after the area it was built in. The Heysel stadium hosted European Cup finals in 1958, 1966, 1974, and 1985, and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup finals in 1964, 1976 and 1980. The highest attendance at a European game was over 66,000 in 1958.

Even though it was Belgium's national stadium, Heysel was not well maintained. The stadium's poor condition became apparent at the 1985 European Cup Final. For example, the outer wall had been made of cinder block, and fans who did not have tickets were seen kicking holes in it to get in. Additionally, the only escape route led upward, and there were only three gates on each short side–nowhere near enough for the 22,000 people standing on the terraces on either side.

The stadium's inadequacies had been well known for some time. When Arsenal played there in the early 1980s, its supporters ridiculed it as a "dump." Indeed, the presidents of the two 1985 European finalists, Juventus and Liverpool, had concluded that Heysel was in no condition to host a European Final, especially one featuring two of the largest and most powerful clubs in Europe at the time. They urged UEFA to move the match to another ground, to no avail. It later emerged that UEFA had only spent half an hour inspecting the stadium.

The Heysel Stadium disaster resulted in the deaths of 39 Juventus fans, after they were attacked by Liverpool fans before the match. Despite this, the stadium continued to be used for Belgium international games between 1986 and 1990, with minimal improvements to the stadium made after the disaster. This was mainly because the government had drawn up plans to remodel the stadium into a 35,000-seat facility. In 1990, UEFA forced the issue by barring Belgium from hosting a European Final until at least 2000. It continued to host track and field events and it still hosts the Memorial Van Damme every year.

In 1995, the stadium was rebuilt at the cost of BEF 1,500 million (around €37/$50 million in 1995). The stadium was also renamed to the King Baudouin Stadium, after the former Belgian king. It was re-opened on August 23, 1995, as the home of the Belgium national football team. It is the largest stadium in Belgium, with a capacity of 50,093. The remodeled stadium hosted the 1996 European Cup Winners Cup final, as well as the opening game for Euro 2000.

In March of 2019 the Belgian football association announced plans for a new redevelopment of the King Baudouin stadium. The stadium would be rebuilt to a reduced capacity of 40,000 spectators, and would be renamed to the Golden Generation Arena.

English independence

English independence is a political stance that wants England to leave the United Kingdom and be an independent country. 

Since the Acts of Union 1707 when it united with Scotland to make the United Kingdom of Great Britain, England has not been an independent country or had any autonomy.

The idea of an independent England is very old and dates back centuries but it has grown in the last few years since Welsh independence and Scottish independence movements have gained large support. Political parties such as the English Democrats and English Independence Party have been founded in the 21st century and want English independence.

There has also been paramilitary groups, such as the English People's Liberation Army, who fought for independence. In 1983, the group claimed they were to blame for a parcel bomb sent to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's headquarters.

There have also been calls for an English Parliament, instead of full independence as England is the only country in the UK to not have its own legislature.

If England did manage to gain independence, estimates say that it'd have the world's 5th biggest economy and would be the 15th richest country in the world.

Ideas of an independent Scotland were first made in the 19th century but were initially only calls for home rule within the United Kingdom. Ideas of a fully independent Scotland have became bigger in the late 20th and 21st century. The Scottish National Party, a party that wants full independence, have won a large number of seats in recent elections, showing the growth of the idea.

In September 2014, a Scottish independence referendum was held. 1,617,989 (44.7%) voted for independence and 2,001,926 people (55.3%) voting to stay as a part of the UK. But, since this referendum, the nationalist and independence movements have continued.

The growth in the idea has resulted in increased Welsh independence movements and also English independence movements.

Temporal paradox

A temporal paradox, is a time paradox, or time travel paradox. It is a paradox, or logical contradiction, of time and time travel. 

Temporal paradoxes fall into two broad groups. Consistency paradoxes (example: the grandfather paradox) and causal loops. 

A causal loop is a paradox of time travel. It occurs when a future event is the cause of a past event, which in turn is the cause of the future event. Both events then exist in spacetime, but their origin cannot be known.

Other paradoxes of time travel are a variation of the Fermi paradox, and paradoxes of free will that stem from causal loops such as Newcomb's paradox.

Fermi's so-called paradox is not a paradox, just a question. It does not involve logic, just the practical (empirical) fact that stellar distances are so great, and our ability to collect data from other bodies is limited.

Eutropia (daughter of Constantius I)

Eutropia (died 350) was a Roman woman of the Constantinian dynasty (a line of rulers who governed the Roman Empire during Late Antiquity). Eutropia was the daughter of the Roman emperor ConstantiusI, the half-sister of the emperor Constantine the Great, and the mother of Nepotianus. Eutropia's mother was Flavia Maximiana Theodora, the wife of Constantius I.

Eutropia was written about by the Roman historians Eutropius, Aurelius Victor, and Zosimus. The bishop Athanasius knew her and also wrote about her.

Eutropia was born after her parents married in late 289. Eutropia's father was ConstantiusI, who was made an emperor in 293. Eutropia's mother was Theodora. Theodora was the daughter of the emperor Maximian and his wife, who also had the name Eutropia. Eutropia had an older half-brother, Constantine the Great, and five other full siblings, the other children of Constantius and Theodora.

Constantius's and Theodora's children were probably born after 295 and before 306. Theodora may have given birth to Eutropia after the year 300. Eutropia might have been her parents' youngest child.

Eutropia's full name may have been the , although it may have been . She probably had the title in . This was a title women of the emperor's family normally had. The emperor Constantius died in 306. Constantine then became an emperor.

There is no evidence that any of Constantius's daughters married before their father died. Eutropia's sister Constantia may have been the first to marry, and may have been the oldest of the siblings. She married in 313. Their sister Anastasia married in 316. Eutropia herself probably married by the early 320s, if she married the Roman consul of 336.

Eutropia probably married Virius Nepotianus. He was Roman consul in the year 336. Eutropia's father was probably dead by the time she married, so her half-brother Constantine, now emperor, probably arranged her marriage. The choice of Eutropia's husband was probably for political reasons, just as Constantia's marriage to Constantine's co-emperor Licinius in 313 was for reasons of political strategy.

Virius Nepotianus may have died in 337, the year Constantine the Great died. (After the emperor died, many people in Constantine's family killed one another in summer 337.) Eutropia survived because the emperor ConstantiusII did not kill the women in the family. The fact that Eutropia continued to live means that Ammianus Marcellinus was wrong when he wrote that ConstantiusII had killed everyone in his own family. The only other members of the family to live through the killings of 337 were Eutropia's nephews Constantius Gallus and Julian.

At some time after her wedding, Eutropia was probably the owner of a ship. A sign made of bronze that has been in the library of the Department of Classics at Harvard University since 1961 might have come from the ship. It was probably a "No Trespassing" sign. Its purpose was to keep people off the ship and to show that the ship was Eutropia's property. The bronze sign came from Ostia, the port of Rome, and the ship was possibly used for the transport of grain supplies to the capital city. The ship may also have been a barge on the Tiber River (the river that connects Ostia with Rome) or a boat used for private leisure.

The sign says that the ship was the property of "Flavia Valeria Eutropia ". The means "most noble woman", and women from the emperors' families used this title. Because there are only two women named Eutropia in emperors' families, the ship very probably was the property of either Eutropia herself or her grandmother, Eutropia (wife of Maximian). The bronze sign is the only evidence for the name "Flavia Valeria Eutropia". It reads:

The bronze sign says that the ship was the property of Eutropia "and her sons" (or "and her children"). If the ship was the property of Eutropia the daughter of Constantius I, then the sign shows that she had more than one child. No-one knows when Eutropia's son Nepotianus was born. He is probably one of the children of Eutropia the bronze sign speaks of. Because no-one killed Eutropia's son Nepotianus in 337, it may be that Eutropia had not yet given birth to him at that time.

Eutropia lived in Rome for a long time, and both Athanasius and Zosimus wrote that she met Athanasius in Rome in the 340s. Eutropia may have given Athanasius political help when he came to Rome in late 339. He made a pun on her name, saying she was "the aptly named Eutropia" because the name "Eutropia" comes from the . Athanasius says that Eutropia was among those people who helped him in Rome, saying that she "received us nobly".

In the 5th century, Jerome wrote that Athanasius came to Rome to speak to powerful Roman women about the monks and monasteries in the desert of Roman Egypt. Jerome wrote that this was the start of monasteries in the west of the Roman Empire. This is probably not true, but Athanasius probably did lobbying with Eutropia and others to try to get back political power in the Christian Church. Eutropia was a woman in the emperor's family, so Athanasius will have tried to get help from her when he was in Rome between 339 and 342.

Athanasius's writing may mean that Eutropia was a representative of the Constantinian family in Rome. Women from the emperor's family often represented the emperor in Rome, because the emperor was not often in the city. Eutropia lived in Rome at the same time as Constantina, Constantine's daughter, who lived in Rome from 337 to 351.

When Eutropia's half-nephew, the emperor ConstansI died, Eutropia's son Nepotianus made an attempt to be emperor himself. Nepotianus took the emperor's title "Augustus" () in 350. Magnentius, who had killed Constans, soon killed Nepotianus.

Women in the Roman dynasties usually depended on the lives of the men in their family. Magnentius probably killed Eutropia in Rome – she died soon after her son Nepotianus died. Athanasius wrote about her death. Athanasius was also friendly with Magnentius's representatives. This may mean he was not in fact friendly with Eutropia and Nepotianus.

When Magnentius was dead, Athanasius said to ConstantiusII in a speech that he had never written friendly letters to Magnentius. He says Eutropia was Constantius's "aunt of blessed memory". Athanasius said he had no reason to write to Magnentius, because Magnentius had killed many of Athanasius' friends. Athanasius asks rhetorical questions of Constantius, asking how Athanasius could have written to Magnentius after Magnentius had done so much against him and his friends:

Picardy Spaniel

The Picardy Spaniel () is a medium size spaniel type of gun dog. It was developed in France in the 19th century, but has even older origins with the French nobility. It is closely related to the Blue Picardy Spaniel, and they are very alike in appearance (except for the colour), but the Picardy Spaniel is the older of the two breeds.

These dogs are always light brown with darker brown patches (called brown roan in dogs).

The Picardy Spaniel has a gentle nature and likes to take care of children in a family. As they are natural hunting dogs they require lots of exercise.

Because English spaniels had been introduced to France in the early 20th century, this dog became less popular with the French hunters who liked the English dogs and their numbers began to get smaller. Then World War I and World War II both caused the breed to nearly become extinct and a lot of effort was needed in to save the breed, they saved the breed but it is still not widely known outside of France.

In Medieval Manipur, during the reign of Emperor Garib Niwaj Pamheiba, the temple structure was re-modified from its former architecture. Besides, it was also re-affiliated with Hinduism, other than its own Sanamahism (Meitei religion), by the installation of idol of Hindu goddess Durga, besides that of Irai Leima.

Melissa Duck

Melissa Duck is an animated cartoon character in Warner Bros.' "Looney Tunes" and "Merrie Melodies" cartoon series. She is the main character Daffy Duck's blonde girlfriend. Only in one cartoon is she called Melissa.

The 1945 cartoon "Nasty Quacks" was when Melissa was first introduced. She also plays Baby Melissa in "Baby Looney Tunes".

In "Nasty Quacks", Daffy's owner, a girl, also becomes the owner of a small, yellow duckling. A jealous Daffy feeds the duckling growth pills. To his surprise, she ages into a white and female duck with blonde hair. By the end of the cartoon, the two have fallen in love. Melissa gives birth to ten black, white and yellow ducklings of her own. 

Melissa first appeared in adult form in a 1950 short, "The Scarlet Pumpernickel". In the cartoon, she is the love interest of Daffy Duck and a damsel-in-distress. The plot follows Daffy saving Melissa from having to marry the evil Grand Duke, Sylvester the Cat.

Later in "Muscle Tuscle" (1953), the girlfriend of Daffy Duck appears with him on the beach. The girlfriend's design is a lot more stylized than Melissa's appearance in "The Scarlet Pumpernickel". However, the comtemporary comics adaptation "Muscle Tuscle" also carried Melissa to this new design.

Another blonde female duck was shown in the 1987 cartoon movie "The Duxorcist". This was after the original "Looney Tunes
ended in 1969.

Melissa Duck was the possible inspiration for Shirley the Loon ("McLoon is her family name). Shirley was on "Tiny Toon Adventures".

Disgrace of Gijón

The "Disgrace of Gijón" is the name given to the 1982 FIFA World Cup match between West Germany and Austria. It was played at the El Molinón stadium in Gijón, Spain, on June 25, 1982. The match was the last game of Group 2, with Algeria and Chile having played the day before. With the outcome of that match already decided, a win by 1 or 2 goals for West Germany would result in both West Germany and Austria qualifying ahead of Algeria, who had defeated West Germany in the first game. West Germany took the lead after 10 minutes, with the remaining 80 minutes being characterized by few serious scoring attempts on either side. Both teams were accused of match-fixing, although FIFA ruled that neither team broke any rules.

As a result of this, and similar events at the previous World Cup in Argentina, FIFA changed the group system for future tournaments, so that the final two games in each group would be played at the same time. In German, the match is known as (lit. "Non-aggression pact of Gijón") or (lit. "Disgrace of Gijón"), while in Algeria it is called (, "Scandal of Gijón"); it is also called the (in reference to the annexation of Austria by Germany in 1938).

Algeria began the tournament with a shock 2–1 win over West Germany on the opening day. This would be described as the "greatest World Cup upset since North Korea beat Italy in 1966", and as "one of the biggest shocks in World Cup history". Algeria became the first African team to defeat a European team at the FIFA World Cup. They then lost 2-0 to Austria, before beating Chile 3–2 in their final match. Algeria's win against Chile made them the first African team to win twice at a World Cup.

As Algeria played their final match the day before West Germany played Austria, the two European teams knew what result they needed in order to both qualify for the next round. A West German win by one or two goals would see both West Germany and Austria qualify. A larger West German victory, by three goals or more, would see West Germany and Algeria qualify (this is because Algeria had scored more goals than Austria, which meant they would qualify even with the same goal difference), while a draw or an Austrian win would eliminate the West Germans.

West Germany and Austria ended up advancing from the group, at the expense of Algeria. Austria ended up losing to France in Group D, while West Germany lost the final to Italy.

Scots law

Scots law is the system of laws used in Scotland, a home nation of the United Kingdom. Scots law is a mixture of a common law system and a civil law system. Scotland has its own judiciary and its own courts. Scotland kept Scots law from the old Kingdom of Scotland after the Acts of Union 1707 formed the British state.

Scots law is different from English law because the two kingdoms of Great Britain in the High Middle Ages and after, the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England each had its own system of laws. The Scots jurisdiction kept its own legal system, and Scots law and Scots courts are independent of English law.

After the personal union of Scotland with England and Ireland under their common king, James VI and I, Scotland kept Scots law and England kept English law. After the unification of the Parliament of Scotland with the Parliament of England by the Acts of Union 1707, the new Parliament of Great Britain in London's Palace of Westminster got the power to make Scots laws. The Parliament of Scotland, the old legislature, came to an end. Scots laws started again to be made in Scotland when the new Scottish Parliament came into being as a result of devolution in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Both the British and Scottish parliaments now make Scots law. These two legislatures are sometimes called "Westminster" and "Holyrood", named after the areas of the capital cities in which they meet.
