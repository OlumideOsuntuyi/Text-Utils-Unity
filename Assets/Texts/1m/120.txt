William John Trevor "Jack" Evans (April 21, 1928 – November 10, 1996) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman and coach who played 14 seasons in the National Hockey League for the New York Rangers and Chicago Black Hawks.

Evans was born in Garnant, Wales, but emigrated with his parents to Drumheller, Alberta in his youth. He spoke no English until he entered school. Although he did not begin playing hockey until age 14, by age 20, a quick-learning Evans was a leading junior league defenceman and participated in the 1948 Memorial Cup. That same year, he signed a minor league contract with the Rangers. 

Evans played five games over the next two seasons, while gaining experience in the American Hockey League. He would then spend the next four years as the Rangers' seventh defenceman, moving in and out of the lineup as needed and serving as a valuable defensive reserve. During the 1954–55 NHL season, Evans finally cracked the regular lineup and worked significant minutes for the next three years on the blue line. In 1958, he was claimed by Chicago, where he would play in a similar role for his final four seasons. He was a member of the 1961 Stanley Cup winning team. Jack Evans played in 1962 NHL All Star game in Toronto. In 1964, the Blackhawks released Evans, but the veteran continued to play in a variety of minor leagues until he finally retired in 1972 at the age of 44.

In 1974, Evans was hired to coach the Salt Lake Golden Eagles of the WHL. After one season that included coach of the year honors, he was promoted to the parent club California Golden Seals. He coached the anemic franchise in its final year in the Bay Area and its two seasons as the Cleveland Barons before the financially troubled organization merged with the Minnesota North Stars in 1978 (only later to be reincarnated as the San Jose Sharks).

Evans returned to the ECHL bench before being hired by the Hartford Whalers in 1983. In his third season with the club, he earned a playoff berth, and in 1987, he led the club to a division title. A poor performance the following year resulted in Evans being fired midseason.

Evans died of prostate cancer at his Manchester, Connecticut home in 1996 at the age of 68.

Saturnalia

Saturnalia was an ancient Roman festival. It honoured of the god Saturn. It was held on 17 December of the Julian calendar. Later it lasted longer, through to 23 December. The holiday was celebrated with a sacrifice at the Temple of Saturn, in the Roman Forum, and a public banquet. There was private gift-giving, continual partying, and a carnival atmosphere. Gambling was permitted, and masters served their slaves. A common custom was the election of a "King of the Saturnalia". The poet Catullus called it "the best of days".

Long Valley Caldera

Long Valley Caldera is a depression in east California next to Mammoth Mountain. The valley is one of the Earth's largest calderas, the result of a gigantic volcanic eruption. The valley is about long (east-west), wide (north-south), and up to deep.

Long Valley formed 760,000 years ago when a supervolcanic eruption released very hot ash that later cooled to form the Bishop tuff that is common to the area. The eruption emptied the magma chamber under the area, so it collapsed. The second phase of the eruption released pyroclastic flows that burned and buried thousands of square miles. Ash from this eruption blanketed much of the western part of what is now the United States. It is not expected to explode again in such a manner.

The explosion released 600 cubic kilometres (140 cu mi) of material from vents inside the margin of the caldera. By way of comparison, the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption released 1.2 cubic kilometres (0.29 cu mi). This eruption had a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 7.

Panphagia

Panphagia is a sauropodomorph dinosaur. It was described in 2009. It lived around 231 million years ago, during the Late Triassic period in Argentina.

"Panphagia" is one of the earliest known dinosaurs. It is an important find which may mark the change of diet in early sauropodomorph dinosaurs.

Temptation of Christ

The temptation of Christ is detailed in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke.
After His baptism, Jesus went into the desert where he didn't eat for 40 days. Then He was temped by Satan who told him to change stones into bread. Jesus didn't do it even though he must have been hungry. He said that Man does not live by bread alone, but by the words that come from the Father's (God's) mouth. The devil then told Jesus to jump off the highest part of the Temple to show his power, since the Bible said that God would send angels to save Him. Jesus replied that the Bible also says not to "test the Lord your God". Then the Devil offered to give Jesus all of the World's kingdoms if Jesus would worship him. Jesus replied that we should worship only God. 

All three temptations are recorded in each of the three Synoptic Gospels. But the order in which they were told is different between the accounts. Some scholars think the Gospel authors chose the order of the three temptations to make a particular point, not just because they were careless in telling the story.

Arc welding is the most effective way of permanently joining metals. It melts the two metals being joined and fuses them together, effectively turning them into one solid unit.

Arc welding uses electricity to melt the metals and the welding filler by creating an electrical arc. An electrical arc is like a tiny lightning bolt that passes between two metals, generating intense heat that melts the two metals and the filler material, fusing them together.

Commonly used for ship building in WWII, this method of welding has become common for creating steel structures.

Love &amp; Basketball

Monica Wright and Quincy McCall have wanted to be professional basketball players since they were kids. Monica has wanted to play for the Los Angeles Lakers and wear Magic Johnson's number 32. Quincy has wanted to be like his father and wear number 22. But Monica has to work hard to establish herself. Quincy was born with natural star potential. As the two fight hard to reach their goals of playing professionally, they must also deal with their emotions for each other.

The first quarter of the story begins around 1981, when Monica and her family moved to Los Angeles from Atlanta, Georgia. They quickly became friends with their new neighbors, the McCalls. Quincy and Monica are drawn to each other instantly. They share a love for the game: basketball. Quincy is shocked that a girl could "ever" love basketball as much as he did. And he's even more shocked when Monica plays so well. In the first interaction, Quincy angrily knocks her down during game point and scars her face. But the next day, they share their first kiss on the first day of school. They end the first quarter of the story by fighting in the grass.

The second quarter of the story begins in 1988. Both Monica and Quincy are the respective leaders of their high school teams. Scouts have taken clear notice of Quincy. Many see him as one of the top prospects in the country. He was very popular on the court and with the other students. He could have any girl he wanted. But he is still good friends and neighbors with Monica.

Monica, though, has problems with her fiery emotions on the court. This has often resulted in many technical fouls during critical moments of games, being benched and eventually pushing away lots of potential scouting chances due to her lack of control. Aside from her emotions on the court, Monica also has problems with the emotions she still secretly has for Quincy. She has a hard time expressing them because he is always surrounded by other girls. Monica also has problems with her mother Camille, who is a stay at home wife and mother. From the time she was a little girl, Monica has been pressured by her mother to give up basketball and act like a lady. This leads to the point where Camille has forced Monica to wear dresses and skirts against her will. It has continued into her high school years, when Camille still complains that Monica is too much of a tomboy and needs to learn to be more female. This causes Monica to feel hurt and hateful toward her mother for not accepting who she is.

The third quarter of the story follows Quincy and Monica to their freshman year at the University of Southern California in 1988-1989. At this point they are managing themselves as athletes, students and a couple. However, the same problems seem to show themselves, only this time on a bigger stage. Quincy finds instant success on the basketball court, and more female admirers. But Monica struggles for playing time. She's the backup to the USC's senior guard, Sidra O'Neal. Making matters worse, she falls on the bad side of the head coach, Ellie Davis. Davis reprimands Monica for showing off and for lack of defense. Monica's relationship to Quincy becomes more difficult.

The movie later concludes at 1998. Monica has finally gone pro in the Women's National Basketball Association. The WNBA was created a couple years earlier in the 1990s. The movie ends with Quincy and Monica's toddler daughter cheer Monica on during one of her games.

Colour theory

Color theory is a guide color mixing and the visual effects of color combinations. 

There are also definitions (or categories) of colors based on the color wheel: primary color, secondary and tertiary colors. Color theory principles first appeared in the writings of Leone Battista Alberti (c. 1435) and the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci (c. 1490).

The foundations of pre-20th-century color theory were built around "pure" or ideal colors, as sensory experiences rather than the physical world. This has led to a number of inaccuracies in the color theory principles.

There is a difference between the behaviour of light mixtures, called additive color mixing, and the behavior of paint, ink, dye, or pigment mixtures, called subtractive color mixing. The absorption of light by material substances follows different rules from the perception of light by the eye.

A second problem is the failure to describe the important effects of strong light. The appearance of colors reflected from a surface (such as paints or inks) is not the same as mixed colors of light. "Colors" such as browns or ochres cannot appear in mixtures of light. A strong lightness contrast between a mid-valued yellow paint and a surrounding bright white makes the yellow appear to be green or brown, while a strong brightness contrast between a rainbow and the surrounding sky makes the yellow in a rainbow appear to be a fainter yellow, or white.

Another problem is the tendency to describe color too simply, for example as a contrast between "yellow" and "blue". Most color effects are due to contrasts on the attributes that define all colors:


Thus, the visual impact of "yellow" vs. "blue" hues in visual design depends on the relative lightness and saturation of the hues.

Many color theorists have said that three "pure" primary colors can mix "all possible colors". They think any failure of paints or inks to match this ideal performance is due to the impurity or imperfection of the colorants. But any three real "primary" colors of light, paint or ink can mix only a limited range of colors, which is always smaller than the full range of colors we can see.

Shark finning

Shark finning is the act of removing fins from sharks. It is mostly done when shark is still alive. The sharks are sometimes thrown back to the ocean after removing their fins but they are still alive. since they are unable to swim properly, they sink to the bottom of the ocean and die of suffocation or are eaten by other predators. Shark finning at sea helps fishing vessels in increasing their profit. It also helps to increase the number of sharks harvested, as they only have to store and transport the fins, which is the most profitable part of the shark; the shark meat is bulky to transport. Some countries have banned this practice and require the whole shark to be brought back to port before removing the fins.

Shark finning increased since 1997 largely due to the increasing demand for shark fins. It is used in shark fin soup and traditional cures, particularly in China and its territories. The International Union for Conservation of Nature's Shark Specialist Group say that shark fin trade is causing a serious danger to the shark population. It estimates of the global value of the shark fin trade range from US$540 million to US$1.2 billion (2007). Shark fins are among the most expensive seafood products, commonly sold at US$400 per kg. In the United States, where finning is not allowed, some buyers regard the whale shark and the basking shark as trophy species, and pay $10,000 to $20,000 for a fin.

Vello Asi

Vello (Ergav-Vello) Asi (October 18, 1927 – November 20, 2016) was an Estonian interior architect, graphic designer and professor at the . Together with Väino Tamm, he has been one of the most important interior architects and representer of modernist interiors in Estonia since the late 1950s.

Born in Vana-Saaluse village in Saaluse rural municipality, Võrumaa. Bother parents were from Võrumaa, mother was a farmer and father was a craftsman.

Interest in arts started already in high school, where he began to design school wallpapers and leaflets. Even though his parents wanted him to continue studies in medecine at the University of Tartu, he decided to study interior architecture at . He graduated from Võru Secondary School No. 1 in 1948 and began studying at ERKI from the same year.

A significant part of his university projects is made up of copying historic furniture drawings. They were mostly made at the and the Peeter I  House Museum in Kadriorg. Interior and furniture design projects were also made for a cabin, a clubhouse, a small apartment. His graduation work was the interior design for the hall of Tallinn Polytechnic Institute.

From 1954-55, he worked in Tallinn at the national architecture design studio "". In the studio Asi`s tasks were primarily drawing architectural details, sections, plans and coloring them. 

Subsequently, he worked in the ARS institute from 1956-1964. During those years he completed several museum exhibition designs and he also belonged to the team of interior architects who in 1954-61 made a new interior design for the Estonian Pavilion of the USSR Economic Achievements Exhibition in Moscow. After working in ARS Vello Asi continued creating exhibition designs in Estonia, as well in Moscow, London, Ulaanbaatar. In addition to interior architecture, he also did graphic design and book design, most of which consists of designing Jaan Kross's books and several architecture related books.

His most important works express rationality and tectonic clarity: the Kurtna poultry farm (1967), the offices of the Writers' House in Tallinn (1963), the Tuljak (1967) and Tallinn cafes (1967-69), Karolina bar (1968; the last three with Väino Tamm), the Radio House studio (1965-77, with H. Oruve), the Viru hotel(1972, with V. Tamme and L. Raudsep, Nõuk, Estonian prize ) and interiors of the Pirita Marine Center Yacht Club and Press Center (1980).

One of his early career`s most important works are the Tallinn Writers' House offices (1963), most significantly the hall with the black ceiling. This was his minimalist and severe reaction to the existing 1950s official style that was more theatrical and festive. Although some have associated the black color with a strong symbolic shadow, Asi has acclaimed he chose the color primarily for practical reasons - to hide holes and dents of the ceiling. However, he was obliged to go to Moscow in order to justify the color choice as the bosses in Tallinn did not dare to give their signature to the project. In addition to the hall, Asi designed in the Writers' House the cabinets and its furniture.

            An important part of his work was born in collaboration with the interior designer and university schoolmate Väino Tamm. Together they created interior design for Valve Pormeister's architectural masterpieces - the cafe Tuljak and the Kurtna Poultry Farm Testing building. The patron of both buildings was Edgar Tõnurist. He wished that the Tuljak Cafe (1967) would be a self-service brasserie, with a terrace for barbecue and a terrace with fireplaces. The interior of the cafe had a long table along the wall and the room was filled with wood furniture.

          Tõnurist was also the patron for the main building of the Kurtna Poultry Farm Testing building, designed by Valve Pormeister. The interior design by Tamm and Asi is based on the architecture and complements it. Modernist interior design is important in the interior: furniture is not designed as a single object but rather as an architectural space element.

            In the 1960's, the life of the Old Town of Tallinn became active and new cafes and restaurants were born. Tamm and Asi designed several new cafes in Tallinn`s Old Town: Varietee and cafe Tallinn, wine bar Karoliina, and the restaurant Gloria. The Tallinn cafe (1967-1969) was located on the first floor of Harju Street 6, the Varietee stayed on the second floor. The cafe was filled with the no. 14 Thonet chairs. Tamm and Asi designed tables and a long banquet. The outdoor terrace was in the green area of ​​Harju Street. The Karolina Bar was designed in the former defensive fortress at the Freedom Square.

Tamm and Asi also made together the interiors for Tallinn's new Radio House, the new Pärnu theater, and the Tartu Vanemuine theater. The most important project was the (Henno Sepmann, Mart Port, 1972). Besides Tamm and Asi, the project was made by Loomet Raudsepp, Taevo Gans and Mait Summatavet. The most important feature of the interior architecture was its perfect harmony with exterior architecture. There was a similar use of materials and simple surfaces both indoors and outdoors. The vestibule was designed by Asi who covered the walls and floors with a dark ceramic tile. The furniture can be characterized by strict geometric volumes that are in perfect harmony with the shape of the room.

The design of the Tallinn Olümpia-Purjespordikeskus (Regati pst. 1) was led by Väino Tamm in 1975-80. The design tasks were divided between the interior architects team (Tamm, Asi, Aulo Padar, Juta Lember, Leo Leesaar). Vello Asi designed the dining room (with Leo Leesaare), the yacht club and the press section.

List of twin towns and sister cities in Switzerland

This is a list of places in Switzerland having standing links to local communities in other countries. In many cases, these completely ceremonial associations, especially when formalized by the local governments, are called by the fallacious name of "town twinning" – though other terms, such as "sister city" and "partner town" are far more accurate. While most of the places included in this list are cities or towns, the list also contains villages, districts, counties, cantons, provinces, etc. with similar links.

The list includes twin towns and sister cities ("Partnergemeinden", "Partnerstädte", "villes" ou "communes jumelles") of towns in Switzerland linked by a sister-city agreement ("Städtepartnerschaft" or "Gemeindepartnerschaft"; "jumelage de villes") or friendship agreements ("Freundschaft" or "amitié").

A few Swiss municipalities participating in projects arranged by the Swiss organizations "Patenschaft für Berggemeinden" ("Parrainage suisse pour communes de montagne") are included. The program arranges sponsorships of municipalities in the Swiss Alps by other Swiss municipalities. The twinning may be a private initiative (e.g. between Zürich and San Francisco) or an initiative of the city authorities.

Partial source (only Vaud):










Geneva does intentionally not have any particular "sister" tie with any city in the world. It declares itself related to the entire world.

Lake Maracaibo

Lake Maracaibo () is a large brackish tidal bay (or tidal estuary) in Venezuela. It is an "inlet of the Caribbean Sea". It is often called a lake rather than a bay or lagoon. In the north, a channel 55 km long connects it to the Caribbean Sea.

The lake is named after the city Maracaibo, which lies on the east side of this channel. In Maracaibo, this channel is about 8.5 km wide. General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge spans this channel. It is one of the longest bridges in the world.

The lake has a size of about by . 135 rivers flow into the lake. The biggest of them is Catatumbo River, which is 500 km long. Others include Escalante River and Chama River.

In the northern part of the lake, there is brackish water. The southern part of the lake is freshwater. There are many islands in the lake.

In most parts of the lake, the water is very shallow. For this reason, a canal has been built, so that oceangoing ships are able to access the ports of Maracaibo and Cabimas.

In 1914, crude oil was found in the lake, near Cabimas. The surrounding Maracaibo Basin contains large reserves of it; the lake is a major profit center for Venezuela. Almost a quarter of Venezuela's population live in the basin around the lake.

Lake Maracaibo is not very deep, on average, it only has a depth of . Its biggest depth is . Its water is very warm, usually . During the day, a lot of water evaporates from the lake. At night, the air around the lake cools down faster than the air over the lake. This leads to the formation of clouds. Because of the difference in temperature, thunderstorms are frequent. Large flocks of cattle graze in the area around the lake. Very often, they are hit by lightning. Lightning may also hit one of the many oil extraction facilities in the lake, which often catch fire.

This weather phenomenon is known as Catatumbo lightning. It regularly occurs at Lake Maracaibo and produces more lightning than any other place on the planet.

The environment of the lake has several problems. Part of the lake is infested with the duckweed "Lemna". Duckweed are plants that float freely on the water. The problem with "Lemna" is that it spreads very fast. Its cover of the water can double in 48 hours. The plants can only be removed physically. In mid 2004, about 18% of the lake was covered with it.

Duckweed is not toxic to fish, but it takes oxygen out of the lake as it decays. This kills fish. Though officials say the weed has not harmed fish yet, it is harming the local fishing industry. The plant clogs the motors of small boats, making it impossible for fishers to launch their vessels.

Duckweed also threatens the local ecosystem because it shades the lake: Other plants in the lake do not get enough light, and die off. In certain conditions, the weed may concentrate heavy metals and bacteria such as "Salmonella" and "Vibrio cholerae", the bacterium that causes cholera. Even though it causes many problems, the weed may also have some use: Duckweed can be treated to feed poultry, or to make paper.

The lake has other problems. Untreated sewage is released into it, and oil drilling operations cause pollution with crude oil.

Cuckoo bee

Cuckoo bees lay their eggs in the nests of other bees, rather like cuckoo birds. They are kleptoparasites, a term which means parasitism by theft. In this case the theft is of food stored for the host larvae.

Females of cuckoo bees lack the special long hairs which collect pollen. Also, they do not make their own nests. They often have reduced body hair, thick exoskeleton, and saber-like mandibles.

They enter the nests of pollen-collecting species, and lay their eggs in cells made by the host bee. When the cuckoo bee larva hatches it eats the host larva's pollen ball. If the female has not already done so, it kills and eats the host larva. In a few cases the invading female stays in the host nest and lays many eggs. Sometimes it kills the host queen and replaces her. Species like that are often called 'social parasites'. Some are referred to as 'brood parasites'. There is a whole subfamily of bees which do this, the Nomadinae (nomad bees).

The behaviour has evolved many times in bees. 16 times parasitism of social species has evolved (mostly in the family Apidae), and there are 31 lineages which parasitize solitary bees. Altogether there are several thousand species of kleptoparasites, a large proportion of overall bee diversity.

Millennium Island

Caroline Island, or Caroline atoll, is an atoll, in the Pacific Ocean that is part of Kiribati. It is the easternomost atoll of Kiribati. The atoll is part of the Southern Line Islands. In total, the atoll consists of 39 islets(motus), which cover a surface (landmass) of about . The atoll covers an area of about 

It was first sighted by Europeans in 1606, it was claimed by the United Kingdom in 1868. It has been part of the Republic of Kiribati since the island nation's independence in 1979. Caroline Island has remained relatively untouched and is considered one of the world's most pristine tropical islands, despite guano mining, copra harvesting, and human habitation in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is home to one of the world's largest populations of the coconut crab and is an important breeding site for seabirds, most notably the sooty tern.

The atoll is currently designated as a wildlife sanctuary. In 2014 the Kiribati government established a 12-nautical-mile fishing exclusion zone around each of the southern Line Islands (Caroline (commonly called Millennium), Flint, Vostok, Malden, and Starbuck). Both Flint and wostok are about to the west. Papeete, Thahiti is about to the south.

It extends about from north to south, and about from east to west. The total landmass is just . The coral reef extends about out. The lagoon is very shallow, and normal boats usually cannot enter. At high tide, it is possible to reach a beach with a boat. At low tide, a walk of about in waist-deep water is required.

In the north and in the south, there are bigger islands. The one in the north is called Nake Island, the one in the south is called South Island. Both have freshwater sources. There are aquifers on both. 

In 1994, Kiribati changed the International date line, so that all of Kiribati would have the same date. This meant that Caroline atoll would be the first landmass on earth with the new date. For the year-2000 celebrations, the atoll was renamed Millennium Island. Other names in the past have included "Hirst Island", "Clark Island" "and Independence Island".

The island is an important breeding place for birds. The only known mammal on the atoll is a rat.

Inigo Jones

Inigo Jones (15 July 1573 – 21 June 1652) was a famous English architect in the early modern period. He was the first person to introduce the architecture of Ancient Rome and the Italian Renaissance to Britain. His buildings were the first in Britain to employ Vitruvian rules of proportion and symmetry. He also made a major contribution as a theatre designer. He designed the scenery and costumes for many masques (a kind of early opera). 

Jones was born in the Smithfield district of London. His father, also called Inigo Jones, was a cloth worker from Wales. As a very young man, he as an apprentice carpenter at St Paul's Cathedral. Some time before 1603 a rich patron (possibly the Earl of Pembroke or the Earl of Rutland) sent him to Italy to study drawing. After Italy he travelled to Denmark where he worked for King Christian V on the designs for the king's Rosenborg and Frederiksborg palaces. When he returned to England he began work as a theatre designer and architect. In September 1615, King Charles I appointed Jones as the Surveyor-General of the King's Works. From 1629 to 1635 he worked for buildings in Covent Garden. 

Jones's career as a full-time architect ended with the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642. The Parliament of England seized all of the King's houses in 1643. In his later years Jones lived in Somerset House in central London. He died there on 21 June 1652. He was buried with his parents at the Church of St Benet. St Benet's was the Welsh church of the City of London.

Duckweed

Duckweed, water lens, or bayroot, are freshwater aquatic plants. They float in still or slow-moving fresh water and wetlands. There are five genera, with a total of 33 to 38 species.

These plants are very simple: They lack an obvious stem or leaves. Most of each plant is a small organized "thallus" or "frond" structure only a few cells thick. Often it has air pockets and floats on or under the water surface. Some have no root and some have one or more simple rootlets.

Reproduction is usually by asexual budding. Occasionally, three tiny flowers are produced for sexual reproduction. These flowers have two stamens and a pistil. From this occasional reproduction is produced a seed in an air bag that floats. The flower of the duckweed genus "Wolffia" is the smallest known, just 0.3 mm long. 

Getting nutrients is a factor for aquatic plants. Duckweeds tend to be found in fertile, even eutrophic conditions. They can be spread by waterfowl and small mammals on their feet and bodies, and by moving water. In water with constant currents or overflow, the plants are carried down the water channels and do not grow so thickly. In some places, weather causes the plants to multiply greatly when water-flow is low. Then they are carried away as rainy periods follow.

Duckweed is an important high-protein food source for waterfowl. It contains more protein than soybeans. The tiny plants provide cover for many small aquatic species. Pondwater species such as bullfrogs and fish such as bluegills use the plants as shelter. 

The plants can provide nitrate removal, if cropped, and the duckweeds are important in the process of bioremediation because they grow rapidly, absorbing excess mineral nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphates. For these reasons, they are touted as water purifiers of untapped value.

Duckweed may be used for wastewater treatment to capture toxins and for odor control. If a mat of duckweed is maintained for the removal of the toxins, it also prevents the development of algae and controls the breeding of mosquitoes. 

These plants also may play a role in conservation of water because a cover of duckweed will reduce evaporation of water when compared to the rate of a similarly sized water body with a clear surface.

In July 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Genome Institute announced that the Community Sequencing Program funded sequencing of the genome of the giant duckweed, "Spirodela polyrhiza". This was a priority project for DOE in 2009. The research was intended to facilitate new biomass and bioenergy programs.

Duckweed is a good candidate as a biofuel because it grows rapidly, produces five to six times as much starch as corn per unit of area, and does not contribute to global warming. Unlike fossil fuels, duckweed removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere instead of adding it.

Duckweed filters out contaminants (bacteria, nitrogen, phosphates) from natural bodies of water, wetlands, and wastewater.

He was arrested, imprisoned and fined. His companies employed 200,000 people. He gave a lot of money to the Nazi Party, and got other companies to do the same. He thought this would stop the spread of communism. In November, 1932, Thyssen and Hjalmar Schacht were the main organisers of a letter to President Paul von Hindenburg telling him to appoint Hitler as Chancellor. 

He sacked his Jewish workers but he objected to the persecution of Christians by the Nazis. After "Kristallnacht" in November 1938, he resigned from the Prussian Council of State. He started criticising Nazi economic policies. In September 1939 sent he Hermann Göring a telegram saying he was opposed to the war. He and his family went to Switzerland. His company was nationalised. In 1940 he moved to France. He was arrested while he was visiting his ill mother in Belgium. In 1943 he and his wife were sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp and in 1945 to Dachau. They were liberated by the 42nd Infantry Division and 45th Infantry Division on 5 May 1945.

After the war he was tried for being a supporter of the Nazi Party. It was decided that he was a lesser offender and he was sentenced to a fine of 15% of his assets. In January 1950, he and his wife moved to Buenos Aires, where he died the following year.

False color

False color (or false colour) refers to a group of color methods used to display recorded images in color. A false-color image is an image which shows an object in colors different from that which a true-colour photograph would show.

In addition, there is "false color" used for visualization of genuine data.

A photograph shot in color will show the colors in the picture as they appeared on the film, or to the sensor of a digital camera. Since most films and most digital cameras are made to show the world as human color vision would see it, this is known as true-color image. In a false color image, the color shown in the image does not correspond to the one the human eye would see. In such an image, color is used for extra information that the eye would not see. Many false color images, for example, show infrared light that humans cannot see.

Vì tương lai Quốc Dân, cùng xông pha khói tên,
Làm sao cho núi sông từ nay luôn vững bền.
Dù cho thây phơi trên gươm giáo,
Thù nước, lấy máu đào đem báo.

Người Công Dân luôn vững bền tâm trí.
Hùng tráng quyết chiến đấu làm cho khắp nơi
Vang tiếng người nước Nam cho đến muôn đời!
Công Dân ơi! Mau hiến thân dưới cờ!
Công Dân ơi! Mau làm cho cõi bờ
Thoát cơn tàn phá, vẻ vang nòi giống
Xứng danh nghìn năm giòng giống Lạc Hồng!

"Oh citizens! Our country has reached the day of liberation."
Of one heart we go forth, sacrificing ourselves with no regrets.
For the future of the people, advance into battle,
Let us make this land eternally strong.
Should our bodies be left on the battlefields,
The nation will be avenged with our crimson blood
In troublesome times, the Race will be rescued,
We the People remain resolute in our hearts and minds.
Courageously we will fight such that everywhere,
The Glory of the Vietnamese forever resounds!
Oh citizens! Hasten to offer yourselves under the flag!
Oh citizens! Hasten to defend this land,
Escape from destruction, and bask our Race in glory 
Be forever worthy of the descendants of Lạc Hồng!

Belling the Cat (movie)

Belling the Cat () is a 2014 Vietnamese animated movie. It was directed by Lê Bình.

Long ago, the mice had a general council to consider what measures they could take to outwit their common enemy, the Cat.

Some said this, and some said that ; but at last a young mouse got up and said he had a proposal to make, which he thought would meet the case.

"You will all agree", said he, "that our chief danger consists in the sly and treacherous manner in which the enemy approaches us. Now, if we could receive some signal of her approach, we could easily escape from her". "I venture, therefore, to propose that a small bell be procured, and attached by a ribbon round the neck of the Cat. By this means we should always know when she was about, and could easily retire while she was in the neighbourhood".

This proposal met with general applause, until an old mouse got up and said : "That is all very well, but who is to bell the Cat ?". The mice looked at one another and nobody spoke. Then the old mouse said : "It is easy to propose impossible remedies".



Manhoa

Truyện tranh (Chữ Hán: 傳幀) means comic in Vietnamese (aka Vietnamese Comics). This term has the English name Viet comics created by "" magazine in the 1960s to refer to comics originating in Vietnam. It is sometimes called by the older name Mạn họa (Chữ Hán: 漫畫). In Vietnamese sometimes it will be called by longer names such as: "Truyện tranh Việt Nam", "truyện tranh Việt", "truyện tranh nội", "truyện tranh ta", "truyện tranh trong nước"... to distinguish it from other types of foreign comics such as: "Truyện tranh Âu Mỹ" (Western comics), "truyện tranh Nhật Bản" (Manga)...

During the Medieval Annam, "Viet comics" often be called "mạn họa" (漫畫, comics) or "liên-hoàn họa" (連環畫, sequential drawings) which was affected by China and sometimes India. They illustrated philosophy or tales which were printed by wood-blocks. There were some drawings for the educating females which were called ""moral books" (Luân-lý giáo-khoa thư).
After the establishing of the Fédération indochinoise with a long peace, the printing technology developed strongly to make books and newspapers became more. "Viet comics" has appeared gradually as cartoons which was called "hoạt-kê họa" (滑稽畫), "hí họa" (戲畫) or "biếm họa" (貶畫).

About 1930s when Europeanisation movement was, "Viet comics" becamed an independent art with a big number of artists and readers. Customs&Mores Weekly (Phong-Hóa tuần-báo) and Today Weekly (Ngày-Nay tuần-báo) had known with three comic characters , Official's Son Weekly (Cậu-Ấm tuần-báo) with the "Three adventurous kids" (Ba đứa trẻ mạo-hiểm), Drake Weekly (Vịt-Đực tuần-báo) with sequential drawings what often satirized Annamese writers, Indochinese government, especially the Governors-General... "Viet comics" always be called "chuyện bằng tranh" (stories by drawings).

After WWII, there were comics what asked Vietnamese people against French Army and satirized French Government. In Hanoi and Saigon there were more comics what based on romance novels or knight tales. Besides, there were some comics with the topic of Vietnamese history and mythology.


From the late 1960s, comics flourished in the Republic of Vietnam by the Freedom of the Press. Firstly, the (established in 1962) called "Viet comics" as "Tranh-truyện Việt-nam" (Vietnamese pictorial-stories).

These led to an increase in the number of comic artists. The most famous illustrator and comic artist at the time was Võ Hùng Kiệt and he was also an illustrator for stamps. His comics were much loved by children and even women. Topics often as : Family, friendship, adventure, detective, science fiction, wuxia, fairytales... which was affected by French comics, American and Hollywood, even Jules Verne, Conan Doyle, Jin Yong's works.

In the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, comics usually appeared on Pioneer Magazine, Children Magazine and Kim-Đồng books. Their contents were about family, friendship, moral, war, fairytales... Northern artists' style always be affected by Soviet art.

After the Reunification Day, Viet comics' style was more and more un-diversity because the print has been difficult. However, in 1980s there were some Kim-Đồng's artists who started drawed in dó paper because they were very cheap. Topics often be fairytales and war for avoiding the censorship.


Viet comics have changed much since 1987 as they steadily developed though the years and gradually became similar to American comics with a growing number of comic artists and comic genres. Meanwhile, in response to the needs of children, the government attached special importance in encouraging the creation of comics. The most famous artist was Nguyễn Hùng Lân whose comics were popularly read ("Hero Hesman", "Vietnamese supermen", "Vietnamese fairytales"...). The content of these publications was broadly educational and offered lessons in moral philosophy for the reader. Many artists often "borrowed" international comics and animated films for imitating, as : "Well just you wait", "Superman", "Jurassic park", "Tom and Jerry", "Charlot"...

Everything was to change in 1992 with the import of manga by Kim-Đồng and Youth. Since 1995 when the manga storm would really hit, suddenly Viet comics with educational and moral stories were overwhelmed and dull by comparison. Manga was able to engage with a broad readership and was readily available ; it saturated the market even though most was then illegally printed. That changed in 2004 when Vietnam finally signed an expanded version of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, and copyright was discussed and respected. The management of sales and content of manga has since become strictly controlled.

Despite the "invasion" (called by 2000s Vietnames newspapers) of manga-manhwa-manhua fighting for a place in the Vietnamese market, 4 the rise of comics in a Vietnamese style was slow to gain pace given lingering prejudices, the feeling that comics were for children. Yet gradually, Vietnamese artists started to produce comics. In 2002, the Phan Thị Company published the comic series titled "Vietnamese child prodigies" (Thần-đồng đất Việt) and this was a turning point in Viet comics. It attracted many young readers and became a long-selling comic with more than 120 volumes produced. The comic might be considered similar to manga in panel layout and onomatopoeia (the formation of a word from a sound associated with what is named), and the style in which characters are drawn.

Moreover, Youth Laughs Monthly, Hoa Học Trò Weekly and Truyện Tranh Trẻ Magazine (Youth Publishing House) also worked positively. They called Viet comics as "mạn họa" for dream about the comics compared "triman" (manga-manhwa-manhua).

Agkistrodon contortrix

Agkistrodon contortrix is a species of venomous snake. The common name for this species is the eastern copperhead. It lives mainly on the eastern coast of North America and in the Mississippi drainage. They're common. Compared to others they're more likely to bite if they feel threatened. They're medium-sized. One of the longest ones ever recorded measuring a little more than four feet long. The copperhead is venomous, but its venom is rarely fatal to humans.

Copperhead snakes have reddish-brown bodies with a crossband pattern consisting of tan and copper. The average length adult copperheads is 76 cm in length. and are normally described as heavy-bodied snakes. Copperheads are sexually dimorphic. The head has a solid, rich brown color. Copperhead venom is usually not fatal to healthy adult humans. They can live up to 18 years.

It is found in North America. In the United States, it is found in Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Northern Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. In Mexico, it is found in Chihuahua and Coahuila.

It lives in many different types of habitats. In most of North America, it likes deciduous forest and mixed woodlands. During the winter, it hibernates in caves or in cracks in limestone. It is also found in coniferous forest. It is also found in the Chihuahuan Desert of West Texas and northern Mexico.

The copperhead eats mainly rodents, especially mice. Sometimes it eats birds, other reptiles, even snakes, and amphibians. They also feed on some insects, a lot of times cicadas, because of their size that'll fill a copperhead up. They eat other animals, but they're not the apex predator around their habitat, Their natural predators include kingsnakes, water moccasins (also known as cottonmouths), bullfrogs, large birds of prey, coyotes, alligators, and an other predators.

The copperhead snake is active from March or April to early November in the northern part of its range. During the winter, they have been seen to basking on warm days in December and January. Even though copperheads have been seen hibernating by themselves they usually hibernate together.

Copperheads are mainly active during the day in the spring and autumn. In the summer months, they become nocturnal to hunt during the evening.

The copperhead snake breeds in late summer, but not every year. They give birth to their young ones alive. They usually give birth to four to seven young ones. The young ones are lighter in color, and with a yellowish-green-marked tip to the tail, which is used to lure lizards and frogs.

Even though copperhead snakes are venomous, bites are almost never fatal. The symptoms of a bite from a copperhead snake is extreme pain, tingling, throbbing, swelling, and severe nausea.

The venom of the southern copperhead has been found to hold a protein called "contortrostatin" It stops the growth of cancer cells in mice and also stops the tumors from moving to other places in the body. However, further testing is needed to make sure that it is safe and efficient in humans.

The antivenom CroFab is used to treat copperhead bites that show symptoms. It is not given when there is no symptoms.

Republic of Vietnam Military Forces

The Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces or ARVN (/QLVNCH), were the official armed defence forces of the Republic of Vietnam (RVN), popularly known as South Vietnam, a state that existed from 1955 to 1975 that control half of Vietnam what is now the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The QLVNCH was responsible for the defence of the Republic of Vietnam since its independence from France in October 1955.

The QLVNCH was formally established on December 30, 1955 by the Strongman and republican first President of the Republic of Vietnam (known simply as ‘South Vietnam’) Ngo Dinh Diem, which he declared on October 26 that year after winning a rigged referendum for either making South Vietnam a constitutional monarchy, or a presidential republic. Created out from ex-French Union Army colonial Indochinese auxiliary units (French: "Supplétifs"), gathered earlier on July 1951 into the French-led Vietnamese National Army – VNA (Vietnamese: "Quân Đội Quốc Gia Việt Nam" – QĐQGVN), Armée Nationale Vietnamiènne (ANV) in French, the armed forces of the new state consisted in the mid-1950s of ground, air, and naval branches of service, respectively:
Their roles were defined as follows: to protect the sovereignty of the free Vietnamese nation and that of the Republic; to maintain the political and social order and the rule of law by providing internal security; to defend the newly independent Republic of Vietnam from external (and internal) threats; and ultimately, to help reunify Vietnam – divided since the Geneva Accords in July 1955 into two transitional states, one at the north ruled by Ho Chi Minh’s Marxist Lao Dong Party regime and the other in the south under Diem’s anti-communist regime.

Thread snake

The thread snake or the slender blind snake ("Leptotyphlops carlae") is the smallest known snake. They can be found in North America, South America, Asia and Africa.

They live in places like rainforests and dry areas like deserts, and are known to appear near ant and termite nests. This is the main source of their diet. Thread snakes lay eggs.

Ophidiophobia

Ophidiophobia or ophiophobia is the abnormal fear of snakes. It is sometimes called herpetophobia, which is a fear of reptiles or amphibians. The word comes from the Greek words "ophis" () meaning snake, and "phobia" () meaning fear. 

This is a phobia, so it does not include people who do not like snakes or fear them for their venom. A person with ophidiophobia (called an ophidiophobe) not only fears them when in live contact, but is scared to think about them or even see them in video or still pictures.

About a third of adult humans are ophidiophobic, making this the most common reported phobia. Scientists think that mammals may have an innate fear of snakes. This was vital for their survival as it allowed such dangerous threats to be identified immediately.

Dil Se Dil Tak

Dil Se Dil Tak (English: From Heart To Heart) was an Indian Hindi romantic television drama, which premiered on 30 January 2017 and aired on Colors TV.
The show deals with the concepts of surrogacy and selfless love. Its premise is based on the 2001 Bollywood film Chori Chori Chupke Chupke.The Show went Off Air on 1 June 2018 and it got replaced by Silsila Badalte Rishton Ka.

The Story initially focussed on the lives of Parth (Siddharth Shukla) and Shorvori (Rashami Desai), a happily married couple, which changes after the entry of Teni (Jasmin Bhasin), a young bubbly girl, who decides to become a surrogate mother to their child. But the Story now deals with the Love Triangle of Parth (Rohan Gandotra), Teni (Jasmin Bhasin) and Iqbal (Mohammed Iqbal Khan).

Parth Bhanushali (Siddharth Shukla), the grandson and heir to the conservative and affluent Bhanushali family falls in love with their employee, the Bengal-based beautiful Shorvori (Rashami Desai), and marries her, despite rejection by and subsequent separation from their family. Two years later, Shorvori gets pregnant and is accepted by Parth's family. However, an unfortunate accident results in a miscarriage, rendering Shorvori infertile. Parth and Shorvori keep the miscarriage hidden from the family, not wanting to ruin their happiness and contentment. Then enters their lives, Teni (Jasmin Bhasin), a carefree-outgoing-lively-bubbly Gujarati girl whom Parth and Shorvori select for surrogacy, in return of their promise to fulfill Teni's dream of going to America. Teni gets pregnant with Parth and Shorvori's child through IVF. Shorvori introduces Teni as her cousin to the family as she begins to live in Bhanushali house. Parth's aunt Poyni (Urvashi Upadhyay) with her daughter Sejal (Himani Sharma) doubt that Teni is hiding something and to be not related to Shorvori, given her ways and Gujarati dialect. Sejal tries to defame Teni in front of the family but in vain. Later, the family arranges for Teni's engagement, but she manages to call it off, proclaiming that she is already in a relationship with Parth's friend, Aman (Kunal Verma). Aman comes from the US on Dadaji's (Tej Sapru) insistence to get the situation clear but ends up falling in love with Teni at first sight and proposes marriage to Teni. Teni agrees, to fulfill her desire to get settled in America and live a financially secure life with her lover, Aman. Parth's family conducts a ritual for his and Shorvori's prospective child's welfare but on Shorvori's insistence, Teni sits in the puja with Parth as she is bearing the child. Teni wavers in her decision to marry Aman as she starts falling in love with Parth, the love that she realises as her impending marriage with Aman approaches, but decides to marry Aman for his, Parth and Shovori's sake. Teni however ends up confessing her feelings to Parth as he contemplates revealing everything to Shorvori. Meanwhile, Bhanushali family is in turmoil following the revelations regarding Teni's pregnancy as Parth accepts the baby to be his! Aman is even forced to break all ties with her and he walks out of her life. But when Shorvori come to Parth and Teni's defense, Dadaji comes to the shocking decision of banishing the trio from the family. But on getting to know of the surrogacy truth, the family eventually forgives Parth, Shorvori and Teni as they are again welcomed in the Bhanushali family.

Parth-Shorvori along with the entire Bhanushali family redouble their efforts to take care of Teni and the perspective child. However, Indu (Vaishnavi Mahant), Parth's mother, starts criticizing Shorvori,for lying about her pregnancy to the family. Shorvori feels distressed and goes on to misunderstand Parth's growing relationship with Teni upon noticing Parth and Teni in few random situations. Shorvori makes a stern request, following which Parth stays away from Teni and even refuses to talk to her. Now with the two people closest to her acting distant and aloof, Teni feels neglected and interacts with Parth ragarding the matter as Shorvori walks in and spotting them together, she lashes out at Parth for breaking his promise and accuses him of cheating on her and takes the drastic decision of leaving the house, ending her relationship with Parth. Later, Teni gets to know that Shorvori has brain tumour and is going to die soon. She just pretended as if she misunderstood Parth and Teni to earn their hatred. She forbids Teni from informing Parth about her condition and wants Teni to be the woman for Parth after her death. Shorvori continues her drama to make Parth and family members hate her, but in vain. Teni decides to help her out in her drama as finally, Shorvori sends divorce papers to Parth and even gets him arrested for one night. The family turns against Shorvori as they now believe that Parth should forget Shorvori and marry Teni instead.The entire family supports Teni when she decides to leave the house with the unborn child as Parth had declined her marriage proposal. Parth begins to suspect Shorvori's true intentions and asks Teni to make Shorvori sign the divorce papers in his presence as a condition for marrying Teni. Shorvori calls Teni talk in private, but meets with an accident as her car's brakes fail and it crashes into a tree. Teni witnesses the accident but fails to rescue Shorvori as the car goes up in flames, killing Shorvori!

Teni informs Parth and the family that Shorvori is dead, much to their shock. Parth disbelieves her, but is heartbroken on seeing the dead body in the hospital. While the family members lament Shorvori's death, Parth struggles to cope with the pain of losing her. Teni, following Shorvori's wish, together with the family, finally convinces Parth to move on for the sake of his and Shorvori's unborn child, however, refuses to marry Teni. On seeing the accident video of Shorvori on Teni's phone, Parth accuses her of murdering Shorvori and tries to get her arrested, without listening Teni's explanation. But Dadaji takes Teni's side and saves her. Thereafter, Teni, following another heated argument with Parth, has labour pain as in just 7 months, she gives birth to a baby girl (whom Teni later names the baby as Ipshita, as per late Shorvori's wish, from Parth's 'P',Shorvori's 'S' and Teni's 'T'). After her delivery, Teni's life is at stake, but Parth donates blood to her, saving her life; and in return, Teni, following Parth's demand, leaves the house and again settles in her colony, where she starts her catering business.

On new year's occasion, Parth becomes Teni's partner in a couple dance performance in a competition held in Teni's colony and they win. Teni decides to go to America and asks Parth to come to help her get her visa. Parth becomes very sad and finally confesses his love for Teni and proposes her to marry him which she happily accepts. The whole family prepares for their wedding as per ritual. It is now revealed that Shorvori is alive and had been in coma for 3 months. She returns to the house to reclaim Parth on the day of his wedding with Teni, but gets emotional on seeing Parth marrying Teni and leaves the venue. A stranger offers to drop her, but is drunk and starts misbehaving with her after she gets in the car. This incident is recorded in a CCTV camera and is shown in the news. Parth and Teni, on seeing this, decide to go to Nainital where they get to know Shorvori might be staying.

In gs about Teni and saying that she is having a bad intention and Shorvori starts believing it. On the day of Parth's and Shorvori's wedding anniversary, Poyni tells Parth about Teni's sacrifice. Parth later meets Teni in private and they both promise they will be good friends like they were before. Shorvori wants Parth to either choose Teni or her. Teni hears all this and decides to leave the house. Teni's foot accidently slips and Teni falls. At the hospital Teni starts acting weird. The doctor says that Teni is suffering from Selective Memory Loss. Teni starts living in the Bhanushali House as Ipshita's Caretaker. Later, due to some misunderstandings Teni thinks that Bhanushali Family wishes to sell her and are indulged in human trafficking. So she flees away from the Bhanushali House.

The Story shows Parth's daughter Ipshita (Chhahat Tehwani) who is now grown-up. Shorvori has died and Teni is missing from last 6 years. Every family member misses Teni and sees her resemblance in Ipshita. Ipshita misses her mother, Shorvori and Parth also remembers every moment spent with his wife's Shorvori and Teni because Shorvori is dead and Teni is missing. On the other side, Teni is leading a happy life in Delhi and has become a sales manager. She has another love interest named Iqbal (Mohammed Iqbal Khan) who she is about to marry. Due to some consequences Parth and Teni meet each other. Parth and his mother tried to convince her and failed by the cause of Teni's memory loss. Then after leaving Iqbal's house Teni and Parth see each other at the minister's building as goons came to the building already creating chaos forcing the minister to let a man be free from jail. But the minister refused. Gunshots were heard as Parth followed Teni as the goons ensured that was no one in the building.

Bassetki

Bassetki is a small village in Iraq, in Dohuk Governorate of autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan. Several important archaeological finds were made there.

In 1975 a fragment of a figure of Naram-Sin of Akkad was found near Bassetki. The statue is now called the Bassetki Statue. 

In August–October 2016,  the Institute for Ancient Near Eastern Studies from the University of Tübingen and Hasan Qasim from the Directorate of Antiquities in Dohuk did archaeological work near Bassetki. They found the remains of a large Bronze Age city.  The city was started around 3000 B.C. It lasted for more than 1,200 years. From around 2700 B.C., the city had a wall protecting the upper part of the city from invaders. The city had a large road network, many residential districts and a palace. A contemporary cemetery was located outside the city. The city was connected to other regions of Mesopotamia and Anatolia by a roadway dating from around 1800 B.C. The archeologists also discovered settlement layers dating from the Akkadian Empire.  The finds were announced by the University of Tübingen on 3 November 2016.

In the summer of 2017, archaeologists from the University of Tübingen in Germany uncovered a collection of Assyrian cuneiform tablets hidden inside a collection of ceramic jugs. These tablets are 3,200 years old. They indicate that the ancient lost royal city of Mardaman was where Bassetki is today.

Brahmagupta

Brahmagupta () (born , died ) was an Indian mathematician and astronomer. He was the author of two early works on mathematics and astronomy: the "Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta" (BSS, "correctly established doctrine of Brahma", dated 628).

Brahmagupta was the first to give rules to compute with "zero". The texts composed by Brahmagupta were composed in elliptical verse in Sanskrit, as was common practice in Indian mathematics. As no proofs are given, it is not known how Brahmagupta's results were derived.


Fuke Zen

Fuke Zen was a branch of Zen Buddhism which existed in Japan from the 13th century until the late 19th century. Fuke monks were noted for playing the shakuhachi flute as a form of meditation. It was characterized in the public imagination of Japan by the Fuke Zen monks playing the shakuhachi flute while wearing a large woven basket hat that covered their entire head as they went on pilgrimage.

Siberian languages

Siberian languages may refer to any languages spoken in Siberia, including:


Orrery

An orrery is a mechanical model of the Solar System. It shows the relative positions and motions of the planets and moons. It is usually a heliocentric model.

The Greeks had working planetaria. The first orrery that was a planetarium of the modern era was produced in 1704. One was presented to Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery – hence the name. They are usually driven by a clockwork mechanism. The globe in the centre represents the Sun, and a planet is at the end of each arm.

The first known orrery was the Antikythera mechanism, variously dated from 60 to 150 BC.

Clockwork

Clockwork means the inner workings of mechanical machines clocks (where it is also called a "movement". Also other similar mechanisms with a complex series of gears.

A clockwork mechanism usually has a clockwork motor. This has a mainspring, a spiral of metal ribbon. Energy is stored in the mainspring by "winding it up", turning a key attached to a ratchet which twists the mainspring tighter. Then the force of the mainspring turns the clockwork gears, until the stored energy is used up. The adjectives "wind-up" and "spring-powered" refer to mainspring-powered clockwork devices. These include clocks and watches, kitchen timers, music boxes, and wind-up toys.

Analogue computer

Analogue computers are mechanical or electronic devices which solve problems. some are used to control machines. They were once the only way a machine could be controlled, and are still used in cases where digital computers are not the best choice. The abacus, a digital device also sometimes called a computer, was used by Babylonians in c. 2500 BC.

The earliest known analogue computer in metal was the Antikythera device. However, this was certainly not the first in other forms. Some people think that mental inventions count as analogue computers, such as the invention of the zero (Ancient Egypt 1700 BC). But in that case almost every invention by mankind would count as an analogue computer, and that is not really how the term is used.

Certainly the invention of the slide rule was important for calculations. They were developed in the 17th century by William Oughtred, after John Napier's work on logarithms. Slide rules are definitely mechanical calculating machines. They were the most commonly used tools in science and engineering before the 1960s/1970s.

For the industrial revolution the invention of James Watt's governor was critical, because it was a negative feedback control for large pumps and engines. In fact most analogue computers work with continuous data rather that discrete or digital data. They are like abstract models of the real world. An analogue engine models the critical aspects of the real-world engine.

Since the middle 20th century some wristwatches have had a circular slide rule built in. They were mostly used in aviation. Such a calculator is considered too technical a device for most other watch wearers. The circular slide rule has not been emulated digitally in any notable applications.


Tiger keelback

The Tiger keelback ("Rhabdophis tigrinus") is a species of venomous colubrid snake that lives throughout East and Southeast Asia.

The tiger keelback is shy, so it would be rare to be attacked by one, but they sometimes do, and they do need to survive. And in order to survive, a snake must have a good form of defense. And the tiger keelback has a very interesting form of defense. In addition to having ordinary venomous snake fangs, they have another trick up their sleeve. Like the poison dart frog and sea slug, the tiger keelback doesn't bother to produce its own venom - rather, it gets its deadly venom from the toads it eats as part of its normal diet. When the tiger keelback feels even the tiniest bit threatened, it'll angle the two little glands on the back of its neck and use it against the predator, the one who seems a threat to the snake. The liquid, or rather, "fluid," that exits the snake's nuchal glands contains something called bufadienolides, that irritate airways and affect heart muscle. 

The snake eats poisonous toads, which fuels the snake's venom. The tiger keelback also eats a few other small vertebrates.

Mike Braun

Michael K. Braun (born March 24, 1954) is an American businessman and politician. Braun is the junior United States Senator of Indiana since January 3, 2019. He is a member of the Republican Party.

He was born in Jasper, Indiana. Braun studied at Wabash College and at Harvard Business School. He served in the Indiana House of Representatives from 2014 to 2017, representing the 63rd District.

In August 2017, Braun announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate. In November 2018, Braun defeated incumbent Senator Joe Donnelly.

After Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election and Trump did not accept his defeat, Braun defended Trump's efforts to overturn the election results and his claims of election fraud.

In September 2022, it was reported that Braun would not run for re-election to the Senate and instead run for Governor of Indiana in the 2024 election. In November 2022, he officially announced his candidacy for Indiana governor.


Flying snake

The flying snake, or "Chrysopelea", is a mildly venomous snake found throughout India to the Indonesian archipelago. It can glide, in an arboreal habitat, going from tree to tree, most likely, much like the draco lizard. They're better at "flying" than another species of animal similar to this - the flying squirrel. 

The flying snake has venom, but much like garter snakes, the snake is so small that the amount of toxins in their saliva is only enough to kill their prey, which will be covered later on in the section about the flying snake's diet. If challenged by an animal far bigger than their venom can bring down, they might bite anyway just to give the predator a great deal of pain, or may choose "flight" rather than "fight" and "fly" away.

The flying snake's usual diet consists mainly of lizards, birds, frogs, bats, small mice and other rodents, which they catch during the day since they're a diurnal creature. 

There are five known species of flying snake, which are the following:


Adichanalloor

Adichanalloor is a village in Kollam district in the state of Kerala, India.

When he was ten, he began drawing with pencil and crayon and sending his drawings to his godfather, Amiet. Then he started to use oils and he painted his first photo of a face at the age of 12. He used his siblings as models. 

In 1915, he went to the Evangelical School in the town of Schiers. He left school in 1919. He continued to develop his art skills in Geneva where he enrolled at the École des Arts Industriels. He travelled to Venice, Padua, Florence and Rome. Here, he was influenced by the collections of Egyptian art he studied. African and Oceanic art also inspired him. He also focused on the surrealism of art. Example of this are "Suspended Ball" and "The Palace at 4 a.m".

From 1922, he lived and worked mainly in Paris. He regularly visited his hometown Borgonovo to see his family and to work on his art.

Northern water snake

The Northern water snake, or "Nerodia sipedon", is a species of non-venomous snake found throughout North America.

The Northern water snake is true to its name and is often found swimming in bodies of water including bogs, marshes, lakes, rivers, ponds and streams. They are also sometimes found basking, since like all snakes they're cold-blooded, and they're sometimes found under logs or rocks near a water source. 

The Northern water snake eats mostly small fishes, reptiles, amphibians, small mammals and insects. 

The Northern water snake, if threatened, will bite even though its bite isn't venomous, and musk on you. Their form of defense is very similar to that of Garter snakes.

Battle of Blair Mountain

The battle of Blair Mountain lasted four days. It was a bloody battle, and it was very deadly to fight or be in. The Battle of Blair Mountain was the largest labor uprising in United States history and one of the largest, best-organized, and most well-armed uprisings since the American Civil War. 

Dates: Aug 25, 1921 – Sep 2, 1921

Location: Logan County, West Virginia, U.S.

Result: Victory for law enforcement and military

The Battle of Blair Mountain was the result of years of bitter labor disputes between the miners and coal companies of southern West Virginia. Since the late 1800s, the coalfields of the state's Mingo, Logan and McDowell Counties had operated under a repressive company town system.

National Popular Vote Interstate Compact

The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC) is an agreement among some U.S. states and the District of Columbia. It changes how the Electoral College chooses the president of the United States. The states agree to give all their votes in the Electoral College to the person with the most votes from regular people in the whole country. The agreement makes sure that person will become president. When that result is guaranteed, the agreement will become active.

Now, fifteen states and the District of Columbia are in the agreement. Together, they have 195 votes in the Electoral College, which are called "electoral votes". When the agreement has 270 electoral votes, it will become active.

The NPVIC is an interstate compact. It will become active when its members control most of the Electoral College. Before that happens, the members will give their electoral votes the way they do now. After that, they will give all their electoral votes to the person with the most votes from Americans in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. (That person wins the "popular vote".) This way, that person will become president.

The U.S. Constitution lets state legislatures decide how to give their votes in the Electoral College. It says this in . The Constitution does not say how the states must do this. (However, the 14th Amendment says that states cannot discriminate against some groups of people.) In the past, states used different ways. Today, nearly all states give all their electoral votes to the person with the most votes in that state, even if they do not have a majority of the votes in that state. Maine and Nebraska separate their electoral votes between areas called "districts". The NPVIC changes how its members give out their electoral votes.

In the past, some people who did not get the most votes became president anyway. Most Americans want the person with the most votes to be president despite the fact that two States, California and New York would essentially cancel out the votes of 43 other States and limit the amount of personal exposure those States receive from potential presidential candidates. In 2007, 72% of surveyed Americans said they wanted to change the Electoral College to a direct vote. This included 78% of Democrats, 60% of Republicans, and 73% of independent voters. Surveys since 1944 show most Americans want a direct vote, except in 2016. Reasons for the NPVIC include:

Several newspapers support the NPVIC. They include "The New York Times", the "Chicago Sun-Times", the "Los Angeles Times", "The Boston Globe", and the "Minneapolis Star Tribune". These newspapers say that the current system makes people not want to vote. They say the current system gives too much attention to a few states and their problems. Other newspapers are against the agreement, including the "Honolulu Star-Bulletin" and "The Wall Street Journal". The former governor of Delaware, Pierre S. du Pont IV, said the agreement gives too much power to cities and states with many people. He said it would make politics be about only city problems, and it would let worse people run for office. The League of Women Voters made a list of documents that argue for and against the agreement.

Some of the biggest arguments are given below:

Today, people running for president give most of their money and attention to states where the vote will be close. The other states are mostly ignored. The maps here show the amount of advertising and visits by the top two people running in 2004. This is adjusted by the number of people in each state. People who support the NPVIC say that it will make the people running work to get votes in every state. People who are against the NPVIC say that states with few people and few cities will not get enough attention.

Some people are against the NPVIC because they worry about cheating. Governor du Pont said that it is easier to add a few false votes in many places than to add many false votes in just a few places. However, National Popular Vote says that adding together all the votes in the country will make it more difficult to cheat. Today, the winner can be decided by a very small number of votes in just one state.

The NPVIC does not say how to count the votes again if the result is not clear. Each state does this for its own votes. However, the result for the whole country can be close even if the result in each state is not. People who support the agreement say that a close result is less probable in the whole country than in each state.

People don't agree about whether the Electoral College helps states with few people, or states with many people. The Electoral College is not designed to be proportional to population: states with few people have more electoral votes for each person than states with many people. If the Electoral College were proportional, California would have 19% more power than it does now. The states with the fewest people would have 30% less power. However, some people say that states with many people have more power than one may expect, because they control so many electoral votes at once. The NPVIC gives the same power to every person, no matter where they live.

Some people believe the NPVIC would help one political party or another, which would not be fair. Pierre S. du Pont IV, a Republican, says the agreement would help Democrats and people in cities. However, Saul Anuzis of the Republican National Committee thinks that the agreement will help Republicans, because he believes most people are closer to Republican political positions. Writer Hendrik Hertzberg of "The New Yorker" says the agreement helps neither party: in the past, each party sometimes had the better position in the Electoral College. In the last five elections, the Democrats had the better position in three years (2004, 2008, and 2012) and the Republicans had it in two years (2000 and 2016). In four of those years, Democrats won the most votes in the country.

The NPVIC can force a state to give its electoral votes to someone who did not win the most votes in that state. For this reason, two governors (Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Linda Lingle of Hawaii) stopped their states from joining the agreement. (Both those states later joined the agreement.) People who support the agreement say that the number of votes in any one state is not as important as the choice of most people in the whole country.

Those who support the NPVIC say that it is legal and allowed by the U.S. Constitution. Article II of the Constitution lets states decide how to give out their electoral votes. The two men who created the agreement, Akhil Reed Amar and Vikram Amar, hold this position. Jamie Raskin agrees. Raskin is a professor of law and a Congressman from Maryland. He put his name on the first NPVIC bill that became law.

One law student wrote that the agreement could break the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which protects minority voters. However, the U.S. Department of Justice decided that the agreement does not hurt minority voters. It allowed California to join the agreement in 2012. Rob Richie of the organization FairVote says that the NPVIC "treats all voters equally". The same student wrote the NPVIC tries to go around the normal way of changing the Constitution. Raskin replied that going around in this way is legal.

Ian Drake, an assistant professor of political science, believes the agreement will only be proper if the Constitution is changed. Other writers believe that the agreement is already proper. Those who vote in the Electoral College promise to vote for a certain person, but they do not have to vote that way by law. Michael Brody believes that this makes the agreement proper.

It is possible that the agreement needs to be approved by Congress. The Constitution says that agreements between states need Congress to approve. However, the U.S. Supreme Court says that this is not always true. They talked about that question in the court case "Virginia v. Tennessee" and others. They decided the only agreements that need approval are those that threaten the authority of the U.S. government. Every Vote Equal says that the NPVIC cannot threaten the authority of the U.S. government, because the Constitution lets states decide how to give out their electoral votes. Derek Muller does not agree. He argues that the NPVIC affects the U.S. government system, and so it needs approval. Ian Drake says that Congress is not allowed to approve the agreement. Those who support the NPVIC do not agree. They do not think the agreement needs approval from Congress, but they plan to ask for this approval in any case.

In the past, people have made several plans to end the Electoral College by changing the Constitution. This is called an "amendment". However, this is very difficult to do. First, two thirds of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives need to approve the change. Then, three quarters of the states need to approve the change.

The plan that came closest to success was the Bayh-Celler plan. It was introduced in the 91st Congress, which met from January 1969 to January 1971. It was introduced by Representative Emanuel Celler of New York. The Bayh-Celler plan would have ended the Electoral College, and instead made a system using the popular vote. The pair of people with the most votes would become president and vice president, as long as they got more than 40% of the votes. If no one got more than 40%, a new vote would happen with the top two pairs. Celler's plan was approved in the House of Representatives in 1969, by a vote of 338–70. However, it was stopped in the Senate by a filibuster.

In 2005, Representative Gene Green of Texas introduced another plan to chose the president and vice president using the popular vote. Green introduced his plan to Congress as a "joint resolution" called H.J.Res. 9. It was also called the Every Vote Counts Amendment. Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr. of Illinois and Senator Bill Nelson of Florida also introduced joint resolutions in the 111th Congress, which met from 2009 to 2011. All of these plans died in committees, before the whole Congress could vote on them.

In 2001, a law professor named Robert Bennett introduced a new plan. Bennett's plan did not require a change to the Constitution. His plan used the power of the states instead of fighting against it. In Bennett's plan, a group of states that control most of the Electoral College could work together. They would make the popular vote decide the result of elections.

Two other law professors, brothers named Akhil Reed Amar and Vikram Amar, supported this plan. The Amar brothers proposed an agreement between states, made with laws in those states. The states would give all their electoral votes to the person who won the popular vote. The agreement would not become active until it guaranteed that person would win the Electoral College and become president. This agreement became the NPVIC.

The Amar brothers' plan uses two parts of the Constitution:

The Amar brothers' plan could work with as few as eleven states. They believe it would not need approval from Congress. However, that is not certain: the section Approval by Congress explains why.

In 2006, the computer science professor John Koza wrote a book called "Every Vote Equal". The book argues for a National Popular Vote agreement between states. (Koza knew about agreements between states from his work on lottery tickets.) Koza, Barry Fadem, and others made a non-profit organization called National Popular Vote. This organization promotes the NPVIC. It is led by people from both major political parties, including former Senators Jake Garn, Birch Bayh, and David Durenberger, and former Representatives John Anderson, John Buchanan, and Tom Campbell.

In 2006, legislatures in six states looked at NPVIC bills. Illinois even introduced a bill before National Popular Vote announced it at a press conference. That year, the Colorado Senate approved the bill. Both houses of the California legislature approved the bill, but Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger stopped it with a veto.

In 2007, 42 states looked at bills to join the NPVIC. One house of the legislature approved bills in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, New Jersey, North Carolina, Maryland, and Hawaii. Maryland was the first state to join the agreement. Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley signed the agreement into law on April 10, 2007.

Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have joined the agreement.

All 50 states have looked at bills to join the NPVIC. In some states, only one house has approved the agreement: Arizona, Arkansas, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Oklahoma. Maryland, New Jersey, and Washington had bills to leave the agreement, but these failed.
The U.S. Congress can stop laws in the District of Columbia within 30 working days, but they did not do this.

Some states allow laws to be made with a direct vote by the public, called an "initiative" or a "referendum". First, supporters must get a certain number of people to sign their names. Then, the question can be given to the voters. In 2018, groups in Arizona, Maine, and Missouri worked on initiatives to join the agreement, but these did not get enough people to sign.

Nate Silver, who studies elections, says that the NPVIC cannot succeed without support from "red" states (states that mostly vote for Republicans). So far, only "blue" states have joined (states that mostly vote for Democrats). However, legislatures controlled by Republicans have agreed to join the agreement in Arizona, Oklahoma, and New York.

Hereward the Wake

Hereward the Wake was an Anglo-Saxon nobleman. He resisted William the Conqueror. His base was the Isle of Ely in East Anglia. According to legend he roamed the Fens, covering North Cambridgeshire, Southern Lincolnshire and West Norfolk, leading popular opposition to William the Conqueror.

Hereward was exiled from England by Edward the Confessor around 1060 - the exact date is unknown - when he was around 14 or 18 years old. Some sources point his own father as requesting the exile as he was a troublemaker. 

It is unknown exactly when the next event happened but it is thought to have happened around 1069 and 1070. After being exiled Hereward returned to his family home where he discovered that the Normans had murdered his brother and set his head above the door. Hereward sought revenge and murdered a bunch of Normans and set their heads in place of his brother's. Hereward then fled to the Fens where he was sheltered by Abbot Thurstan. 

Around spring time in 1070, Hereward the Wake and King Sweyn of Denmark took the Isle of Ely. Hereward made the Isle his base for his rebellion against the Normans. 

June, 1070, Hereward raided Peterborough Abbey as an act of defiance against the Normans. He stated that he would take the Abbey's treasures into safekeeping away from the Normans. Some sources state that his uncle was the Abbot of the Abbey and Hereward persuaded his uncle to kill him.

Several primary sources exist for Hereward's life. Their accuracy is difficult to judge. They are the version of the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" written at Peterborough Abbey (the "E manuscript" or Peterborough Chronicle), the "Domesday Book" (DB), the "Liber Eliensis" (Book of Ely) and, much the most detailed, the "Gesta Herewardi" ("Gesta").

Eastern hognose snake

Heterodon platirhinos, also known as the Eastern hognose snake, is a species of mildly venomous colubrid snake. It lives throughout North America.

The average length for an adult eastern hognose snake is 71 cm (28 in) in length. The most amazing feature is the upturned nose. It is used for digging in sandy soils. It can be red, green, orange, brown or gray to black depending on where it comes from. The belly tends to be a solid gray, yellow, or cream-colored.

It is found from southern New Hampshire south to the southern tip of Florida and into the central United States. Eastern hognose snakes are also found as far west as Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and into the southern tip of South Dakota. In total, they are found in about thirty states in the United States and are also found in southern Ontario.

Eastern hognose snakes are mostly found in places with dry, sandy, or mixed sandy soils. They are usually found in grassy fields, fields that contain crops, and along woodland edges. Sometimes they can be found near small bodies of water. Eastern hognose snakes are also sometimes found in buildings such as greenhouses and barns.

The Eastern hognose snake eats mainly frogs, lizards, salamanders, insects, other invertebrates, and small rodents. It is only mildly venomous. That means that, much like garter snakes, there's only enough toxins in their saliva to paralyze small animals. 

The predators of the Eastern hognose snake are raccoons, Virginia opossums, red foxes, hawks, common king snakes, cottonmouths, tarantulas.

Eastern hognose snakes are diurnal animals. They will swim to cross between habitats and to find food or mates. Eastern hognose snakes are mostly active from early April until October or November depending on the temperature. Eastern hognose snakes usually begin hibernation anywhere from early September into November. If the temperatures drop to 19 degrees Celsius, they will begin their hibernation. Eastern hognose snakes hibernate by themselves in either burrows made by themselves or abandoned mammal burrows. Eastern hognose snakes tend to burrow at night into sandy soil.

Eastern hognose snakes mate in April and May. They lay 8 - 40 eggs in June or early July. They do not take care of the eggs or young. The eggs hatch after about 60 days, from late July to September. The hatchlings are 16.5–21 cm (6.5–8.3 in) long.

When threatened, the hognose will play dead. It sometimes even lets its tongue hang from its mouth.

It is often thought to be nonvenomous because it is not harmful to humans but it does have venom. Bitten humans who are allergic to the saliva have been known to experience swelling, but no human deaths have been recorded.

Eastern hognose snakes are listed as least concern on the IUCN red list. In the future, they may be threatened because of habitat destruction and decrease in the number of toad in their native areas. Eastern hognose snakes are sometimes mistaken for pygmy rattlesnakes and are often killed because of this.

Eastern hognose snakes eats lots of small mammals, insects, and amphibians and therefore limit their populations. They have the strongest role in limiting toad populations. Eastern hognose snakes have been reported to be mildly venomous to humans.

President of Venezuela

The President of Venezuela (), officially known as the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (), is the head of state and head of government of Venezuela. The president leads the National Executive of the Venezuelan government and is the Commander-in-chief of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces. Presidential terms were changed from five to six years following the adoption of the 1999 Constitution by President Hugo Chávez, and presidential term limits were also removed in 2009 by President Chávez stating that the president can serve as long as he/she wants.

The current president is Nicolás Maduro who has been in power since 15 April 2013 following his victory on the 2013 Venezuelan presidential election the previous day, narrowly defeating his rival Henrique Capriles by 1.5%. Previously, Maduro was the acting president from the death of Hugo Chávez on 5 March 2013 until his inauguration. Maduro was also the Vice President from 2012 to 2013 before assuming the presidency.

In May 2018, Maduro won the Presidential election. However, the election was considered unfair and controversies about the election result grew. Many people demanded Maduro to leave office once his first presidential term ends on 10 January 2019. However, Maduro illegally swore himself in early that day. This made the opposition parties angry at Maduro and thus, the opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who was the President of the National Assembly of Venezuela swore himself in declaring himself Interim President. Immediately many foreign governments mainly that of the United States, Canada, and the European Union and Nato regognized Guaidó's interim government and no loner recognized Maduro as the legitimate president thus beginning the Venezuelan presidential crisis.

Guaidó promised to form a transitional government and hold fair elections and put an end to Maduro's government. However, none of the promises Guaidó and his interim government made came true and by 2022, Guaidó became increasingly unpopular and started to lose support. On 30 December 2022, three of the four main opposition parties voted to dissolve Guaidó's interim government. Eventually on 5 January 2023, Guaidó relinquished his claim to the presidency and officially dissolved his interim government thus ending the presidential crisis. Many foreign governments who recognized Guaidó's interim government switched back to recognizing Maduro's government and once again recognized Maduro as the legitimate president of Venezuela.

Purple music

Purple music () is a kind of music that has been very much at the center of Vietnamese public life from the time of its first strong emergence in the country in the late 1930s up to the present day. It is known as the origin of Vietnamese popular music. Harmonious, sentimental and melancholy, many romantic songs of purple music have become regarded as national treasures and are still performed widely.

Songs of Purple Music carry with them an air of nostalgia, perhaps nostalgia for an era when Vietnam was still unified, the era preceding nearly 20 years of civil war. After 1954, the country was split into two very different regimes, the communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam or North Vietnam, and the Republic of Vietnam or South Vietnam. At that time, some purple music composers went South, while others remained in the North. Most of the Northerners either ceased composing or followed the dictates of the regime for writing songs to mobilize the masses and strengthen the revolution. Southerners continued to write romantic songs. Since the North's victory resulting in Vietnam's reunification in 1975, the country's culture has continued to be divided between resident and overseas communities. As nearly all music and literature of a romantic or sentimental basis was banned by the communist regime, many of Vietnam's creative minds left the country in 1975 for Western countries like the United States, Australia, and France. Although differences between these two communities continue until this time, purple music is one of the few popular song genres that can be heard on the stage of both Vietnam and among the overseas community.

Although Vietnamese music this period has gone through many movements : Patriotic songs, scout songs, happy songs, folk songs... the longest lasting movement is still love song movement. That is the music movement with greatest composers like Văn Cao, Phạm Duy, Lê Thương... and with ever-lasting love songs like. Amongst the best-known ones are "I Come to See You One Rainy Afternoon" (Em đến thăm anh một chiều mưa) by Tô Vũ ; "Send the Wind to Blow Away the Clouds" (Gửi gió cho mây ngàn bay), "Seductive Autumn" (Thu quyến rũ), "Leaves Falling in the Afternoon" (Lá đổ muôn chiều), "A Letter" (Lá thư), "Plum Pack and Pansy Petal" (Một gói nho khô, một cánh păng-xê) by Đoàn Chuẩn ; "Resonance" (Dư âm) by Nguyễn Văn Tý ; "The Girl Next Door" (Cô láng giềng) by Hoàng Quý ; "Drop of Autumn Rain" (Giọt mưa thu) and "The Boat isn't Docking" (Con thuyền không bến) by Đặng Thế Phong.

Gigantspinosaurus

Gigantspinosaurus (meaning "giant-spined lizard") is a mediun-sized stegosaur from the Upper Jurassic. It was found in Sichuan, China. It was only about 4.2 metres (14 ft) long and 700 kilograms (1,500 lb) in weight. The animal had greatly enlarged shoulder spines.

A study suggested that "Gigantspinosaurus" is the most basal known member of the Stegosauria.

Lophorhothon

Lophorhothon (Langston, 1960) is a genus of hadrosaurid dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous, the first genus of dinosaur discovered in Alabama, in the United States.

Remains of this small, poorly known perhaps saurolophine dinosaur were first discovered during the 1940s, from extensive erosional outcrops of the lower unnamed member of the Mooreville Chalk Formation in Dallas County, west of the town of Selma, Alabama.

A number of workers have questioned the validity of "L. atopus". It may have been a premature "Prosaurolophus".

The holotype specimen was likely washed out to sea by a river, where it eventually sank and was buried in the silty carbonate sediments of Alabama.


Nipah virus infection

Nipah virus disease is a disease caused by a dangerous virus. This virus belongs to the "Paramyxoviridae" family and causes severe disease in humans; about half of all patients die. The virus is spread by fruit-eating bats. 
Symptoms of Nipah virus disease start to appear within 3-14 days of infection. When people first get this disease, it looks like some other diseases. People get fever, headache, and throat pain, and they feel very tired. They have difficulty breathing. Later, they get much sicker. They feel dizzy and might become unconscious. 

There have been 582 known cases of Nipah virus infection in humans. About half of these patients died. 

Fruit-eating bats can carry Nipah virus. Humans can get Nipah virus when they come in contact with items that are contaminated by infected bats' excreta. In Bangladesh, people were got Nipah virus when they drank date palm toddy which was contaminated by bats. 

Infected bats can also spread Nipah virus to other animals, such as pigs. In Malaysia and Singapore, people got Nipah virus from pigs that had come into contact with infected bats. 

Nipah virus can transmit from people to people also. It spreads through body fluids such as saliva, blood, and urine. For this reason, the caretakers of infected people are at an especially high risk of getting Nipah virus. The virus is not known to transmit through air. 

Nipah virus can be detected from throat swabs, cerebrospinal fluid (fluid taken by puncturing the spine), and blood tests. Scientists detect Nipah virus by finding copies of viral genome in the test sample. 

After death, Nipah virus can also be identified by examining body tissues.

There is no cure for Nipah virus infection. Ribavirin, a drug that fights some viruses, is possibly effective, but its effectiveness has not been well proven yet. Therefore, the usual treatment is to give supportive care, such as giving medicines to reduce fever and other symptoms. People who get very sick from Nipah virus disease may need ventilatory support. 
Avoiding contact with items contaminated by infected bats is the best way to prevent Nipah virus disease. Since the disease can spread from person to person, those in close contact with a patient must wear protective gear, including special masks, gloves and goggles. Healthcare workers in infected areas should also wear protective gear. 
Nipah virus has caused disease outbreaks in several parts of the world, including Malaysia, Bangladesh, Singapore and India. In 2018, there was an outbreak of Nipah virus in Kerala, India, which was successfully contained.

Antipyretic

Antipyretics (, from the words "anti-" meaning 'against' and "" meaning 'feverish') are substances that reduce fever. Antipyretics cause the hypothalamus to ignore increases in temperature caused by prostaglandin. The body then works to lower the temperature, which results in a reduction in fever.

Most antipyretic medications have other purposes. The most common antipyretics in the United States are ibuprofen and aspirin. These are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used mainly as analgesics to relieve pain, but which also have antipyretic properties. Acetaminophen or (paracetamol), is an analgesic with weak anti-inflammatory properties.

There is some debate over using medication to control fever. Fever is part of the body's immune response to infection. A study by the Royal Society found controlling fever causes at least 1% more influenza cases of death in the United States, which results in at least 700 extra deaths per year.

The final was played at the Olympic Stadium in Baku, Azerbaijan, between English sides Chelsea and Arsenal — which was the first Europa League final to feature two teams from one city. As winners, Chelsea will play against the winners of the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League in the 2019 UEFA Super Cup. And they would also have been qualified for the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League group stage, but since they had already qualified through their league performance, the berth reserved was given to the third-placed team of the 2018–19 Ligue 1, the 5th-ranked association according to next season's access list.

On 9 December 2016, UEFA confirmed the changing of plans for the UEFA Champions League for the 2018–2021 cycle, which was announced on 26 August 2016. As per new rules, all teams that are eliminated in the UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds will get a second chance in the Europa League.

The matchdays are 20 September, 4 October, 25 October, 8 November, 29 November, and 13 December 2018.

Linda breaks curfew one night. She is slapped by her mother. She moves out to live with Chuck and marries him. At a party, Linda watches one of Chuck's pornographic movies. She tells him good girls never do things like that.

Six months later, Linda bails Chuck out of jail for soliciting prostitution. Chuck is desperate for money. He makes Linda become a porn actress. She soon begins working on a movie, "Deep Throat". In the movie, she uses the stage name Linda Lovelace. The movie is a huge hit. It makes over $30,000 in its first week. Linda later poses nude. She attends parties.

But Chuck has a violent nature. Linda's life is revealed to not be as perfect as it seems. Chuck chokes Linda during sex. When she asks Chuck to stop, he refuses. He forces her into prostitution at gunpoint. 

Linda visits her parents to ask if she can move back. She reveals that Chuck has been abusing her. But her mother says no.

When Chuck learns that Linda has been talking about a new salary with the movie's director, Gerard Damiano, without telling him, Chuck punishes her by making her shower in freezing water. 

When "Deep Throat" becomes a hit, Chuck tries to force Linda into doing another porn movie. But she refuses to do that. He then takes her to a party and forces her to participate in a sexual act with several people. Linda tries to escape from Chuck. But he catches her and sleeps on top of her to stop her from trying again.

The following day, she secretly meets a man named Anthony Romano. She tells Romano she wants out of the porn business. She reveals the abuse done by Chuck. A disgusted Romano checks Linda into a private hotel. Romano and his bodyguards beat Chuck for abusing Linda, and for the $25,000 he owes.

Six years later, following her divorce from Chuck, Linda marries Larry Marchiano. They move to Long Island and have a son. She then takes a lie detector test before publishing her book "Ordeal". The book details years of physical and sexual abuse from Chuck, and stealing of all her earnings. She later appears on "Donahue". Her parents break down in tears while watching her. A few days later, the Marchianos go to Florida for Linda to make up with her parents.

Sowore was born in Ondo State in South West Nigeria. He was raised in a polygamous home with sixteen children. At 12, he learnt how to ride a motorcycle so that he could fish at the lake for the family before going to school. The military rule in Nigeria affected his passion and desire for media.

Sowore led 2,000 students in protest against the Nigerian government in 1992. During the protests, the police started shooting and seven people were killed. Sowore was arrested and tortured. He was also involved in the demand for democratic government taking over military rule in June 12, 1993. This resulted in several arrests, detentions and life threatening treatment by government officials.

Sowore started Sahara Reporters in a small room in Manhattan 2006 to fight against corrupt and wrong government practices. Sahara Reporters is supported by grants donated by the Ford Foundation and Omidyar Foundation. It does not accept adverts or financial support from the Nigerian government.

The two of them have several adventures and become very good friends. On one of these adventures, he meets a man who has a boat and cares for all the birds around the river. The man says that Billy can stay with him on his boat as they are going in the same direction. This is the first time Billy has somebody who allows him to be himself. The man also helping him understand some hard truths about life. The journey down the river on the boat begins a journey into young adulthood for both Billy and his beloved fox.

Grace Dieu (ship)

Grace Dieu was the flagship of King Henry V of England and one of the largest ships of her time. It was launched in 1418. The ship only sailed on one voyage, after which it was kept anchored in the River Hamble. The ship was burned in 1439 after being struck by lightning.

"Grace Dieu" was designed by William Soper, a burgess of Southampton and clerk of the King's Ships. She was clinker-built with three planks nailed together along each part of her hull and waterproofed with tar and moss sandwiched between the timbers. She was long with a beam, comparable in size with "HMS Victory" and twice as large as "Mary Rose". The ship weighed between 1,400 tons and 2,750 tons. Two other ships, "Valentine" and "Falcon" were built to follow her. A dock was specially built for her construction near Town Quay in Southampton.

The remains of "Grace Dieu" show that it might have been built in a hurry, with some of the planks and ribs only roughly finished. She was a vast ship requiring 2735 oak, 1145 beech, and fourteen ash trees for her timbers. When completed in 1418, she was one of the largest wooden ships of the time.

In 1420, "Grace Dieu" made her only voyage under the command of the Earl of Devon, with orders to sail down the English Channel. The expedition suffered a mutiny even before leaving port, when the crew objected to soldiers and archers being aboard to guard the vessel. "Grace Dieu"'s sailors attempted to prevent the soldiers from boarding by abusing the clerk who was registering their names and threatening to throw the register into the sea. When the ship finally left port, nine of the crew incited a further mutiny against the captain by refusing to take their stations and insisting that the cruise be abandoned. "Grace Dieu" was brought into the nearest port, St. Helen's on the Isle of Wight, and the crew departed. A clerk who questioned their loyalty as they departed was assaulted and had his clothing torn.

When Henry V died in 1422, his ships were treated as his private property rather than as part of the kingdom's navy. Many were sold off to pay his debts.

In 1430 William Soper, when he was already in charge of the administration of the entire navy, dined with the commander of the Florentine merchant fleet on board "Grace Dieu".

Subsequently, "Grace Dieu" was laid-up in the River Hamble. Her mast and equipment were removed. She was burnt to the waterline after being set ablaze by lightning in 1439.

The remains of "Grace Dieu" are still in the River Hamble at Bursledon, near Southampton, Hampshire. For many years the wreck was believed to be that of a Danish galley or a nineteenth-century merchant ship. In 1933 a proper survey identified the wreck, and its great size. The site was protected by the Protection of Wrecks Act on 5 February 1974. In 2004 the site was excavated by Channel 4's archaeology programme "Time Team" for the 2005 series. Only 50 metres from the wreck lie those of another vessel, believed to be "Grace Dieu"'s contemporary "Holigost".

Form taxon

A form taxon is a group of organisms based on what they look like (their morphology). Such a taxon may not reflect their biological relationships. In other words, they may not be a clade. 

A good example are the terms snake and lizard, which are not good taxonomic terms because neither is a proper clade. On the other hand, all poisonous snakes and lizards are in a good clade, the Toxicofera.

Another good example are ducks. They are in the same family as swans and geese, but called "ducks" because of what they look like.

Neutron moderator

A neutron moderator is a material that slows down neutrons. This is done in nuclear power stations so the neutrons keep a steady nuclear chain reaction to provide heat.

Heavy water

Heavy water (deuterium oxide, ', ') is a form of water based on deuterium.

It has a larger than normal amount of the hydrogen isotope called deuterium ( or D, also known as "heavy hydrogen"). Ordinary water has the common hydrogen-1 isotope ( or H, also called "protium"). This makes up most of the hydrogen in normal water. The presence of deuterium gives the chemical different nuclear properties, and the increase of mass gives it different physical and chemical properties compared to normal "light water". Heavy water is used as a neutron moderator in some nuclear reactors, such as CANDU reactors. It is a more efficient neutron moderator than regular water, allowing the use of unenriched uranium as fuel. Pure heavy water is not radioactive, because deuterium is a stable isotope, but heavy water that has been through a nuclear reactor is slightly radioactive.

The chemistry of heavy water is different enough that people, and most living things, cannot survive with heavy water in place of ordinary water. Small amounts are not toxic to people. It is common for people to drink several grams of heavy water for metabolic experiments without causing illness.

Quaternary sector

Quaternary sector refers to the shift beyond the services sector by some economies, usually used to refer to the shift towards highly specialised, knowledge based and more technologically orientated sectors. Examples include some information services such as cloud computing, and research and development.

Racial profiling

Racial profiling is a term which originated in the United States. The usual context is police stopping and searching citizens on the suspicion that they may have committed a crime. It is controversial because it is usually black citizens who are stopped and searched. In other countries (for example the Middle East) religious and cultural differences may be the basis of police profiling. 

In the USA profiling has been tested in the courts a number of times. "Terry v. Ohio" was the first challenge to racial profiling in the United States in 1968. This case was about African American people who were thought to be stealing. The police officer arrested the three men, searched them and found a gun on two of the three men. One of the men searched was convicted and sentenced to jail. The sentence was challenged on the grounds that the arrest violated the search and seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment. In an 8-1 ruling, the Supreme Court decided that the police officer acted in a reasonable manner, and with reasonable suspicion, under the Fourth Amendment. The decision in this case allowed the police to have discretion in identifying suspicious or illegal activities.

Bagualosaurus

Bagualosaurus (from the Portuguese regional term "bagual", referring to a person or animal of strong build) is a sauropodomorph dinosaur. It is the seventh known sauropodomorph discovered in Brazil. It was described in 2018.

"Bagualosaurus" lived about 230223 million years ago, and grew to about 2.5 meters (8.2 ft) long.

The holotype specimen had a partial skull and jaw, twelve back vertebrae, two tail vertebrae, two chevrons, a pelvis, two partial hindlimbs and five fragmentary ribs. The pieces were found on a ravine at the edge of a pond in rural Agudo in 2007. 

The fossil had been kept in a closet of the Laboratory of Paleovertebrates of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul South. The fossil was described as a sauropodomorph on May 25, 2018.

"Bagualosaurus" probably had a fully herbivorous diet. They had a dentition well adapted for eating vegetation. All sauropods have two characteristics in common: gigantism and herbivorism. Their diet may have been the source of later sauropod gigantism. Modern trees had not evolved, and herbivores at the time had cycads, ferns and early conifers as food.

"Bagualosaurus" lived in the Santa Maria Formation alongside animals such as the carnivorous sauropodomorph "Buriolestes", the crocodile-like "Cerritosaurus" and the possible theropod "Staurikosaurus".

Darwinsaurus

Darwinsaurus (meaning "Darwin's lizard") is an ornithopod dinosaur once wrongly described as "Iguanodon".

In the early nineteenth century dinosaur remains were discovered near Hastings in East Sussex. These were first reported by Richard Owen in 1842. In 1889 they were referred to "Iguanodon fittoni" by Richard Lydekker. They were then assigned to "Hypselospinus fittoni" by David B. Norman in 2010.

In 2012 Gregory S. Paul named them as a separate genus and species. The type species is Darwinsaurus evolutionis. The generic name honours Charles Darwin for his theory of evolution. The first fossil described as "Darwinsaurus" is known from a partial skeleton.

Paul's decision is being challenged, and the present account may need be changed.

Hypselospinus

Hypselospinus is a genus of iguanodontian dinosaur which was first described as a species of "Iguanodon" ("I. fittoni") by Richard Lydekker in 1889, the specific name honouring William Henry Fitton. "Hypselospinus" grew to be around 6 meters (19.7 ft) long.


Carnelian

Carnelian (also spelled cornelian) is a brownish-red mineral commonly used as a semi-precious gemstone.

The gemstone has been used since prehistory.

The employees took apart four Dell computers and built the console from the parts. The employees named the console DirectX Box because it used Microsoft's DirectX graphics program. They showed the console to Ed Fries, who was the leader of Microsoft's game publishing business, and he liked the idea. During work on the project, the name was changed to Xbox.

There are four generations of the Xbox.

Arrow's impossibility theorem

Arrow's impossibility theorem, Arrow's theorem, or Arrow's paradox is a statement from social choice theory, named after economist Kenneth Arrow, who first described it in 1950: Suppose there is a vote, and voters have at least three different options to choose from. Each voter will then rank the options according to his or her preference. Arrow said, that in such a case, there is no way to convert these rankings into a community-wide complete and transitive ranking while also meeting certain criteria.

Arrow demonstrated the theorem in his doctoral thesis. He popularized it in his 1951 book "Social Choice and Individual Values". The original paper was titled "A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare".

In short, the theorem states that no rank-order electoral system can be designed that always satisfies these three "fairness" criteria:

Chicago Outfit

The Chicago Outfit (also known as the Outfit, the Chicago Mafia, the Chicago Mob, or The Organization) is an Italian-American organized crime syndicate based in Chicago, Illinois, which dates back to the 1910s. It is part of the American Mafia originating in Chicago's South Side.

The Outfit rose to power in the 1920s, under the control of Johnny Torrio and Al Capone and the period was marked by bloody gang wars for distribution of illegal alcohol during Prohibition. 

The Outfit did not have a monopoly on organized crime in Chicago, but they were by far the most powerful, violent and largest criminal organization in the Midwest. The Outfit's influence, at its peak, stretched as far away as California and Florida. Higher law enforcement attention and general attrition led to the Outfit's gradual decline since the late 20th century. 

From 1997 until his death in May 2018, the Chicago Outfit was believed to be led by John DiFronzo.

Oobi

Oobi is an American television show for children. It was made by Little Airplane Productions in New York City. It is about a group of talking hand puppets with eyes and clothes. The main character, Oobi, is a 4-year-old boy hand. He has a sister named Uma, a friend named Kako, and a grandfather named Grampu.

The show was first played in 2000 as a series of two-minute short episodes. It started as a series of longer half-hour episodes in 2003. It was shown on the channels Nickelodeon and .

While it was being made, the show was popular with preschoolers and fans of puppetry. It won awards from groups like and the . In the mid-2000s, there was a cult following of small filmmakers who used Oobi-style puppets in short movies. In 2012, a spin-off of "Oobi" called "Dasdasi" was made in Iran. The entire original show is currently included on Amazon Prime Video.

Most episodes are split into two or three parts. Every episode has a main story and some interviews. In the interviews, the puppets ask real kids and families about a topic or place. Episodes in season one also have a "game segment" where the puppets play a simple learning game. In season two, there were no game segments anymore and the main stories were made longer instead.

The show takes place in an old-fashioned town where almost everyone is a talking hand puppet. The puppets have eyes that they wear on the middle finger. The kids have four of their fingers straight, and they use their thumbs as their bottom lips. The adults have their fingers curled up, which makes them look taller. The only regular character who is not a hand is Frieda, a foot puppet.



The show has also been shown in:


"Dasdasi" was a spin-off/adaptation of "Oobi" made in the country of Iran for a TV channel called . In "Dasdasi", there is a bigger family of hand puppets: a son, a daughter, two parents, and a grandfather. The kids are counterparts to Oobi and Uma, and the grandpa is Grampu's counterpart. Kako does not have a counterpart, but the kids have neighbors and a baby cousin who usually fills the role of a close friend instead. "Dasdasi" was first shown on September 22, 2012, and the last episode was shown on December 20, 2012. There were 78 episodes.

"Oobi" got high TV ratings for Noggin. From 2003 to 2004, "Oobi" and two other shows—"Miffy" and "Connie the Cow"—made Noggin's daily viewers increase by 55% over the last year. The average number of preschool-age children watching "Oobi" grew by 43% during the same time. The show's ratings were reported in the newspaper Multichannel News by the author Mike Reynolds, who said Noggin's popularity could be traced to its "breakout original series "Oobi"." The first showing of the "Uma Preschool!" episode on September 6, 2004, got higher ratings than any other Noggin show ever did.

When "Oobi" was still being played on TV, it had a of Muppets fans and small filmmakers who made their own "Oobi" puppets. In 2003, the "Boston Herald" newspaper said that "Oobi" was "already very popular" with "those of the Muppet generation." A worker for Noggin, Tom Ascheim, said in the same article that Oobi "gets fan mail," and he thought it was an interesting idea for a show because "everybody has an Oobi in their hand." In 2004, the magazine "The Melbourne Age" said that "the show - the work of various "Sesame Street" alumni - is developing a strong cult following; the real Uma [Thurman] is said to be a fan of hand Uma." An internet catalog of "Oobi" puppets and eyes, OobiEyes.com, was online from 2006 to 2013. A small group of YouTube.com users who made fan films with "Oobi" puppets existed during the early years of the website, and OobiEyes.com held an advertising campaign with YouTube in 2008.

Pontiac's War (also known as Pontiac's Conspiracy or Pontiac's Rebellion) was an uprising of Native American tribes against British rule in America. A few tribes, mainly from the Great Lakes region, the Illinois Country, and Ohio Country started it in 1763. The cause of the war was that these tribes did not like British politics in the region. Warriors from other tribes joined the uprising to help get rid of the British soldiers and settlers. The war is named after the Odawa leader Pontiac, the most prominent of many native leaders in the conflict.

The British were one of the winners of the French and Indian War, which lasted from 1754 to 1763. As a result, large amounts of land in the region that had been controlled by the French were now controlled by the British. French and British politics were very different. 

The war began in May 1763 when Native Americans attacked many British forts and settlements. They attacked because they had been offended by the policies of Jeffrey Amherst, a British General. Eight forts were destroyed, and hundreds of colonists were killed or taken. Many people fled from the region. Hostilities came to an end after British Army expeditions in 1764 led to peace negotiations over the next two years. Native Americans were unable to drive away the British, but the uprising made the British government change the policies that started the conflict.

Warfare on the North American frontier was brutal. Prisoners were often killed, and civilians were often targeted. Other atrocities were widespread. Native Americans and British settlers had very little in common. In this conflict, this fact showed as ruthlessness and treachery. Contrary to popular belief, the British government did not issue the Royal Proclamation of 1763 in reaction to Pontiac's War. Because of the conflict, the Proclamation's Indian clauses were applied more often, though. This was unpopular with British colonists, and may have been one of the things that helped start the American Revolution.

The conflict is named after its most famous participant, the Odawa leader Pontiac. An early name for the war was the "Kiyasuta and Pontiac War". "Kiyasuta" is a different spelling for Guyasuta, an important Seneca/Mingo leader. The war became widely known as "Pontiac's Conspiracy" after Francis Parkman published a book named "The Conspiracy of Pontiac" in 1851. This book has been the definitive account of the war for nearly 100 years.

In the 20th century, some historians argued that Parkman exaggerated Pontiac's influence in the conflict, and that it was misleading to name the war after him. For example, in 1988 Francis Jennings wrote: "In Francis Parkman's murky mind the backwoods plots [came] from one savage genius, the Ottawa chief Pontiac, and [for this reason] they became 'The Conspiracy of Pontiac,' but Pontiac was only a local Ottawa war chief in a 'resistance' involving many tribes." Even though other names for the war have been proposed, "Pontiac's War" is probably the most commonly used. 

Before Pontiac's rebellion, there were wars in Europe which also had an influence on the French and Indian Wars in North America. The largest of these wars was the Seven Years' War. In this war, France lost New France in North America to Great Britain. The Shawnee and Lenape had also fought in this war. The Treaty of Easton was signed in 1758, and brought peace with these tribes. In the treaty, the British promised not to settle beyond the ridge of the Alleghenies. This line was confirmed in 1763, but few people respected it. Most fighting in the North American theater of the war, generally referred to as the French and Indian War in the United States, came to an end after British General Jeffrey Amherst captured Montreal, the last important French settlement, in 1760.

British troops then occupied the various forts in the Ohio Country and Great Lakes region previously held by the French. Even before the war officially ended with the Treaty of Paris (1763), the British Crown began changes to administer its vastly expanded North American territory. The politics of the French and the English were different. The French had made alliances with Native American tribes, and traded with them. After the war, these tribes were conquered people. Before long, Native Americans who had been allies of the defeated French were dissatisfied with the British occupation and the new policies imposed by the victors.

It is difficult to say who exactly took part in the rebellion. At the time, the region was known as "pays d'en haut" ("upper country"), but its borders were not defined exactly. Until the Paris peace treaty of 1763, it was claimed by France. Native Americans from many different tribes lived there. At the time, a "tribe" was a group of people who spoke the same language, or a group of people who belonged to the same family. It was not a political unit. No chief spoke for an entire tribe, and no tribe acted in unison. For example, Ottawas did not go to war as a tribe: some Ottawa leaders chose to do so, while other Ottawa leaders denounced the war and stayed clear of the conflict.

There were three basic groups of tribes. The first group was composed of tribes of the Great Lakes region: Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi, who spoke Algonquian languages; and the Huron, who spoke an Iroquoian language. They had long been allied with French "habitants". They lived among them, they traded with them, and marriages between French settlers and Native Americans were common. Great Lakes Native Americans were alarmed to learn that they were under British sovereignty after the French loss of North America. When a British garrison took possession of Fort Detroit from the French in 1760, local Native Americans cautioned them that "this country was given by God to the Indians."

The second group was made of the tribes from eastern Illinois Country: It included the Miami, Wea, Kickapoo, Mascouten, and Piankashaw. Like the Great Lakes tribes, these people had a long history of close trading and other relations with the French. Throughout the war, the British were unable to project military power into the Illinois Country, which was on the remote western edge of the conflict. The Illinois tribes were the last to come to terms with the British.

The third group was made of tribes of the Ohio Country: Delawares (Lenape), Shawnee, Wyandot, and Mingo. These people had migrated to the Ohio valley earlier in the century from the mid-Atlantic and other eastern areas. They did this to escape British, French, and Iroquois domination in the New York and Pennsylvania area. Unlike the Great Lakes and Illinois Country tribes, Ohio Native Americans had no great attachment to the French regime. They had fought as French allies in the previous war in an effort to drive away the British. They made a separate peace with the British with the understanding that the British Army would withdraw from the Ohio Country. But after the departure of the French, the British strengthened their forts in the region rather than abandoning them, and so the Ohioans went to war in 1763 in another attempt to drive out the British.

Outside the "pays d'en haut", most warriors of the influential Iroquois Confederacy did not participate in Pontiac's War because of their alliance with the British, known as the "Covenant Chain". However, the westernmost Iroquois nation, the Seneca tribe, had become disaffected with the alliance. As early as 1761, the Seneca began to send out war messages to the Great Lakes and Ohio Country tribes, urging them to unite in an attempt to drive out the British. When the war finally came in 1763, many Seneca were quick to take action.

General Amherst was the British commander-in-chief in North America. He was responsible for the treatment of Native Americans. This involved both military matters and the regulation of the fur trade. In Amherst's opinion, the Native Americans had to accept British rule, since the French were no longer in control of the territory. He also believed that they were incapable of resisting the British Army; therefore, of the 8,000 troops under his command in North America, only about 500 were stationed in the region where the war erupted. Amherst and officers such as Major Henry Gladwin, commander at Fort Detroit, made little effort to conceal their contempt for the Native Americans. Native Americans involved in the uprising frequently complained that the British treated them no better than slaves or dogs.

In February 1761, Amherst took the decision to offer fewer gifts to the Native Americans. With the French, the giving of gifts had been common, and part of the relationship between French and Native Americans. Amherst's decision led to more resentment towards the English. Following a Native American custom the exchange of gifts had an important symbolic meaning: the French gave presents (such as guns, knives, tobacco, and clothing) to village chiefs, who in turn redistributed these gifts to their people. By this process, the village chiefs gained stature among their people, and were able to maintain the alliance with the French. Amherst, however, considered this process to be a form of bribery that was no longer necessary, especially since he was under pressure to cut expenses after the war with France. Many Native Americans regarded this change in policy as an insult and an indication that the British looked upon them as conquered people rather than as allies.

Amherst also began to restrict the amount of ammunition and gunpowder that traders could sell to Native Americans. The French had always made these goods available. Amherst, however, did not trust the Native Americans, particularly after the "Cherokee Rebellion" of 1761. In this rebellion Cherokee warriors took up arms against their former British allies. The Cherokee war effort had collapsed because of a shortage of gunpowder. Amherst therefore hoped that future uprisings could be prevented by restricting the supply of gunpowder. This created resentment and hardship: Native American men needed gunpowder and ammunition, because it helped them with hunting. With gunpowder and ammunition, they had more game for their families and skins for the fur trade. Many Native Americans began to believe that the British were disarming them before starting war against them. Sir William Johnson, the Superintendent of the Indian Department, tried to warn Amherst of the dangers of cutting back on gifts and gunpowder, but he was not successful.

Land was an issue in the coming of the war. With the French, there were relatively few colonists. Most of the colonists were farmers, who also traded fur during the hunting season. In contrast, there were many British colonists. The British colonists wanted to clear the land of the trees and occupy it. Shawnees and Delawares in the Ohio Country had been displaced by British colonists in the east: This was the main reason for their involvement in the war. On the other hand, Native Americans in the Great Lakes region and the Illinois Country had not been greatly affected by white settlement. They were aware of the experiences of tribes in the east, though. Historian Gregory Dowd argues that most Native Americans involved in Pontiac's Rebellion were not immediately threatened with displacement by white settlers. Dowd argues that historians have therefore overemphasized British colonial expansion as a cause of the war. He believes that the presence, attitude, and policies of the British Army, which the Native Americans found threatening and insulting, were more important factors.

Another factor that led to the outbreak of the war was a religious awakening of the Native Americans in the region in the 1760s. Food shortages and epidemics, as well as discontent with the British fed the movement. The most influential person in this phenomenon was Neolin, known as the "Delaware Prophet". Neolin said, Native Americans should steer clear of the trade goods, alcohol, and weapons of the whites. Merging elements from Christianity into traditional religious beliefs, Neolin told listeners that the Master of Life was displeased with the Native Americans for taking up the bad habits of the white men, and that the British posed a threat to their very existence. "If you suffer the English among you," Neolin said, "you are dead men. Sickness, smallpox, and their poison [alcohol] will destroy you entirely." It was a powerful message for a people whose world was being changed by forces that seemed beyond their control.

Although fighting in Pontiac's Rebellion began in 1763, rumors reached British officials as early as 1761. According to these rumors, discontented Native Americans were planning an attack. Senecas of the Ohio Country (Mingos) circulated messages ("war belts" made of wampum) which called for the tribes to form a confederacy and drive away the British. The Mingos, led by Guyasuta and Tahaiadoris, were concerned about being surrounded by British forts. Similar war belts originated from Detroit and the Illinois Country. In June 1761, Native Americans at Detroit informed the British commander of the Seneca plot. After William Johnson held a large council with the tribes at Detroit in September 1761, peace was maintained, but war belts continued to circulate. Violence finally erupted after the Native Americans learned in early 1763 that the French would give the "pays d'en haut" to the British.

The war began at Fort Detroit under the leadership of Pontiac. It quickly spread throughout the region. Eight British forts were taken; others, including Fort Detroit and Fort Pitt, were unsuccessfully besieged. Francis Parkman's "The Conspiracy of Pontiac" portrayed these attacks as a coordinated operation planned by Pontiac. Other historians have since argued that there is no clear evidence that the attacks were part of a master plan or overall "conspiracy". The most common view is that, rather than being planned in advance, the uprising spread as word of Pontiac's actions at Detroit traveled throughout the "pays d'en haut", inspiring already discontented Native Americans to join the revolt. The attacks on British forts did not happen at the same time: most Ohio Native Americans did not enter the war until nearly a month after the beginning of Pontiac's siege at Detroit.

Parkman believed that Pontiac's War had been secretly instigated by French colonists who were stirring up the Native Americans in order to make trouble for the British. This belief was widely held by British officials at the time, but historians have found no evidence of official French involvement in the uprising. Rather than the French stirring up the Native Americans, some historians now argue that the Native Americans were trying to stir up the French. Pontiac and other native leaders frequently spoke about the fact that French power was about to return. When this happened, the Franco-Native alliance would be revived; Pontiac even flew a French flag in his village. All of this was apparently intended to inspire the French to rejoin the struggle against the British. Although some French colonists and traders supported the uprising, the war was initiated and conducted by Native Americans who had Native—not French—objectives.

Historian Richard Middleton (2007) argues that Pontiac's vision, courage, persistence, and organizational abilities allowed him to activate a remarkable coalition of Indian nations prepared to fight successfully against the British. The idea to gain independence for all Native Americans west of the Allegheny Mountains did not originate with Pontiac, but with two Seneca leaders, Tahaiadoris and Guyasuta. By February 1763 Pontiac appeared to agree. At an emergency council meeting, Pontiac clarified his military support of the broad Seneca plan and worked to motivate other nations to join the military operation that he helped lead. This was in direct contradiction to traditional Indian leadership and tribal structure. He achieved this coordination through the distribution of war belts: first to the northern Ojibwa and Ottawa near Michilimackinac; and then after the failure to seize Detroit by stratagem, to the Mingo (Seneca) on the upper Allegheny River, the Ohio Delaware near Fort Pitt, and the more westerly Miami, Kickapoo, Piankashaw and Wea peoples.

On April 27, 1763, Pontiac spoke at a council on the banks of the Ecorse River, in what is now Lincoln Park, Michigan, about 10 miles (15 km) southwest of Detroit. Using the teachings of Neolin, Pontiac convinced a number of Ottawas, Ojibwas, Potawatomis, and Hurons to join him in an attempt to seize Fort Detroit. On May 1, Pontiac visited the fort with 50 Ottawas in order to assess the strength of the garrison. According to a French chronicler, in a second council Pontiac proclaimed:It is important for us, my brothers, that we exterminate from our lands this nation which seeks only to destroy us. You see as well as I that we can no longer supply our needs, as we have done from our brothers, the French... Therefore, my brothers, we must all swear their destruction and wait no longer. Nothing prevents us; they are few in numbers, and we can accomplish it.Hoping to take the stronghold by surprise, on May 7 Pontiac entered Fort Detroit with about 300 men carrying concealed weapons. The British had learned of Pontiac's plan, however, and were armed and ready. As his tactic had not worked, Pontiac withdrew after a brief council. Two days later, he started a siege of the fort. Pontiac and his allies killed all of the British soldiers and settlers they could find outside of the fort, including women and children. One of the soldiers was ritually cannibalized, as was the custom in some Great Lakes Native cultures. The violence was directed at the British; French colonists were generally left alone. Eventually more than 900 soldiers from a half-dozen tribes joined the siege. Meanwhile, on May 28, a British supply from Fort Niagara led by Lieutenant Abraham Cuyler was ambushed and defeated at Point Pelee.

After receiving reinforcements, the British attempted to make a surprise attack on Pontiac's encampment. But Pontiac was ready and waiting, and defeated them at the Battle of Bloody Run on July 31, 1763. Nevertheless, the situation at Fort Detroit remained a stalemate. Pontiac's influence among his followers began to fade. Groups of Native Americans began to abandon the siege, some of them making peace with the British before departing. On October 31, 1763, finally convinced that the French in Illinois would not come to his aid at Detroit, Pontiac lifted the siege and removed to the Maumee River, where he continued his efforts to rally resistance against the British.

Before other British outposts had learned about Pontiac's siege at Detroit, Native Americans captured five small forts in a series of attacks between May 16 and June 2. The first to be taken was Fort Sandusky, a small blockhouse on the shore of Lake Erie. It had been built in 1761 by order of General Amherst, despite the objections of local Wyandots, who in 1762 warned the commander that they would soon burn it down. On May 16, 1763, a group of Wyandots gained entry under the pretense of holding a council, the same stratagem that had failed in Detroit nine days earlier. They seized the commander and killed the other 15 soldiers, as well as British traders at the fort. These were among the first of about 100 traders who were killed in the early stages of the war. The dead were ritually scalped and the fort—as the Wyandots had warned a year earlier—was burned to the ground.

Fort St. Joseph (the site of present-day Niles, Michigan) was captured on May 25, 1763, by the same method as at Sandusky. Potawatomis seized the commander and killed most of the 15-man garrison. Fort Miami (on the site of present Fort Wayne, Indiana) was the third fort to fall. On May 27, 1763, the commander was lured out of the fort by his Native mistress and shot dead by Miami Native Americans. The nine-man garrison surrendered after the fort was surrounded.

In the Illinois Country, , Kickapoos, and Mascoutens took Fort Ouiatenon (about west of present Lafayette, Indiana) on June 1, 1763. They lured soldiers outside for a council, and took the 20-man garrison captive without bloodshed. The Native Americans around Fort Ouiatenon had good relations with the British garrison, but emissaries from Pontiac at Detroit had convinced them to strike. The warriors apologized to the commander for taking the fort, saying that "they were obliged to do it by the other Nations." In contrast with other forts, the Natives did not kill the British captives at Ouiatenon.

The fifth fort to fall, Fort Michilimackinac (present Mackinaw City, Michigan), was the largest fort taken by surprise. On June 2, 1763, local Ojibwas staged a game of stickball (a forerunner of lacrosse) with visiting Sauks. The soldiers watched the game, as they had done on previous occasions. The ball was hit through the open gate of the fort; the teams rushed in and were given weapons which Native women had smuggled into the fort. The warriors killed about 15 of the 35-man garrison in the struggle; later they killed five more in ritual torture.

Three forts in the Ohio Country were taken in a second wave of attacks in mid-June. Iroquois Senecas took Fort Venango (near the site of the present Franklin, Pennsylvania) around June 16, 1763. They killed the entire 12-man garrison, keeping the commander alive to write down the grievances of the Senecas. After that, they ritually burned him at the stake. Possibly the same Seneca warriors attacked Fort Le Boeuf (on the site of Waterford, Pennsylvania) on June 18, but most of the 12-man garrison escaped to Fort Pitt.

On June 19, 1763, about 250 Ottawa, Ojibwa, Wyandot, and Seneca warriors surrounded Fort Presque Isle (on the site of Erie, Pennsylvania), the eighth and final fort to fall. After holding out for two days, the garrison of about 30 to 60 men surrendered, on the condition that they could return to Fort Pitt. The warriors killed most of the soldiers after they came out of the fort.

Colonists in western Pennsylvania fled to the safety of Fort Pitt after the outbreak of the war. Nearly 550 people crowded inside, including more than 200 women and children. Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss-born British officer in command, wrote: "We are so crowded in the fort that I fear disease...; the smallpox is among us." Fort Pitt was attacked on June 22, 1763, primarily by Delawares. The fort was too strong to be taken by force. A siege was organized, which lasted during the month of July. In the meantime, war parties raided deep into Pennsylvania, taking prisoners and killing unknown numbers of settlers in scattered farms. Too strong to be taken by force, the fort was kept under siege throughout July. Two smaller strongholds that linked Fort Pitt to the east, Fort Bedford and Fort Ligonier, were fired upon throughout the conflict, but were never taken.

Before the war, Amherst did not believe that the Native Americans would offer any effective resistance to British rule. During that summer, he was convinced of the contrary. He ordered to "immediately ... put to death" captured enemy Native American warriors. To Colonel Henry Bouquet at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who was preparing to lead an expedition to relieve Fort Pitt, Amherst wrote on about June 29, 1763: "Could it not be contrived to send the smallpox among the disaffected tribes of Indians? We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them." Bouquet responded to Amherst (summer of 1763):

"P.S. I will try to inocculate [sic] the Indians by means of Blankets that may fall in their hands, taking care however not to get the disease myself. As it is pity to oppose good men against them, I wish we could make use of the Spaniard's Method, and hunt them with English Dogs. Supported by Rangers, and some Light Horse, who would I think effectively extirpate or remove that Vermine."

Amherst replied:

"P.S. You will Do well to try to Innoculate [sic] the Indians by means of Blankets, as well as to try Every other method that can serve to Extirpate this Execrable Race. I should be very glad your Scheme for Hunting them Down by Dogs could take Effect, but England is at too great a Distance to think of that at present."

Officers at the besieged Fort Pitt had already attempted to do what Amherst and Bouquet were discussing. During a parley at Fort Pitt on June 24, 1763, Ecuyer gave Delaware representatives, Turtleheart and Mamaltee, two blankets and a handkerchief that had been exposed to smallpox, hoping to spread the disease to the Native Americans in order to "extirpate" them from the territory. William Trent, the militia commander, left records that showed the purpose of giving the blankets was "to Convey the Smallpox to the Indians." Turtleheart and Killbuck would later represent the Delaware at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768.

On July 22, Trent writes, "Gray Eyes, Wingenum, Turtle's Heart and Mamaultee, came over the River told us their Chiefs were in Council, that they waited for Custaluga who they expected that Day". There are eyewitness reports that outbreaks of smallpox and other diseases had plagued the Ohio Native Americans in the years before the siege of Fort Pitt. Colonists also caught smallpox from Native Americans at a peace conference in 1759 which then led to an epidemic in Charleston and the surrounding areas in South Carolina.

Historians cannot agree how much damage the attempt to spread smallpox at Fort Pitt caused. Historian Francis Jennings concluded that the attempt was "unquestionably successful and effective" and inflicted great damage to the Native Americans. Historian Michael McConnell writes that, "Ironically, British efforts to use pestilence as a weapon may not have been either necessary or particularly effective", noting that smallpox was already entering the territory by several means, and Native Americans were familiar with the disease and good at isolating the infected. Historians widely agree that smallpox devastated the Native American population. It is estimated that 400,000–500,000 (possibly up to 1.5 million) Native Americans died during and years after the Pontiac's War, mostly from smallpox,

On August 1, 1763, most of the Native Americans broke off the siege at Fort Pitt in order to intercept 500 British troops marching to the fort under Colonel Bouquet. On August 5, these two forces met at the Battle of Bushy Run. Although his force suffered heavy casualties, Bouquet fought off the attack and relieved Fort Pitt on August 20, bringing the siege to an end. His victory at Bushy Run was celebrated in the British colonies—church bells rang through the night in Philadelphia—and praised by King George.

This victory was soon followed by a costly defeat. Fort Niagara, one of the most important western forts, was not assaulted, but on September 14, 1763, at least 300 Senecas, Ottawas, and Ojibwas attacked a supply train along the Niagara Falls portage. Two companies sent from Fort Niagara to rescue the supply train were also defeated. More than 70 soldiers and teamsters were killed in these actions, which Anglo-Americans called the "Devil's Hole Massacre", the deadliest engagement for British soldiers during the war.

The violence and terror of Pontiac's War convinced many western Pennsylvanians that their government was not doing enough to protect them. This discontent was manifested most seriously in an uprising led by a vigilante group that came to be known as the Paxton Boys. They had this name because they were primarily from the area around the Pennsylvania village of Paxton (or Paxtang). The Paxtonians turned their anger towards Native Americans—many of them Christians—who lived peacefully in small enclaves in the midst of white Pennsylvania settlements. Prompted by rumors that a Native war party had been seen at the Native village of Conestoga, on December 14, 1763, a group of more than 50 Paxton Boys marched on the village and murdered the six Susquehannocks they found there. Pennsylvania officials placed the remaining 16 Susquehannocks in protective custody in Lancaster, but on December 27 the Paxton Boys broke into the jail and slaughtered most of them. Governor John Penn issued bounties for the arrest of the murderers, but no one came forward to identify them.

The Paxton Boys then set their sights on other Native Americans living within eastern Pennsylvania, many of whom fled to Philadelphia for protection. Several hundred Paxtonians marched on Philadelphia in January 1764, where the presence of British troops and Philadelphia militia prevented them from committing more violence. Benjamin Franklin, who had helped organize the local militia, negotiated with the Paxton leaders and brought an end to the immediate crisis. Franklin published a scathing indictment of the Paxton Boys. "If an "Indian" injures me," he asked, "does it follow that I may revenge that Injury on all "Indians"?" One leader of the Paxton Boys was Lazarus Stewart who would be killed in the Wyoming Massacre of 1778.

In spring and summer of 11764, there were more Native American raids on frontier settlements than usual. The hardest hit colony that year was Virginia. In July, four Delaware Indian soldiers killed and scalped a school teacher and ten children in what is now Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Incidents such as these prompted the Pennsylvania Assembly, with the approval of Governor Penn, to reintroduce the scalp bounties offered during the French and Indian War: money was paid for every Native killed above the age of ten, including women.

The Board of Trade held General Amherst responsible for the uprising. As a consequence, he was recalled to London in August 1763. Major General Thomas Gage replaced him. In 1764, Gage sent two expeditions into the west to crush the rebellion, rescue British prisoners, and arrest the Native Americans responsible for the war. According to historian Fred Anderson, Gage's campaign, which had been designed by Amherst, prolonged the war for more than a year because it focused on punishing the Native Americans rather than ending the war. Gage's one significant departure from Amherst's plan was to allow William Johnson to conduct a peace treaty at Niagara, giving those Native Americans who were ready to "bury the hatchet" a chance to do so.

From July to August 1764, Johnson negotiated a treaty at Fort Niagara. About 2,000 Native Americans were present, primarily Iroquois. Although most Iroquois had stayed out of the war, Senecas from the Genesee River valley had taken up arms against the British, and Johnson worked to bring them back into the Covenant Chain alliance. As restitution for the Devil's Hole ambush, the Senecas were compelled to cede the strategically important Niagara portage to the British. Johnson even convinced the Iroquois to send a war party against the Ohio Native Americans. This Iroquois expedition captured a number of Delawares and destroyed abandoned Delaware and Shawnee towns in the Susquehanna Valley, but otherwise the Iroquois did not contribute to the war effort as much as Johnson had wanted.

After they had secured the area around Fort Niagara, the British launched two military expeditions into the west. The first expedition, led by Colonel John Bradstreet, was to travel by boat across Lake Erie and reinforce Detroit. Bradstreet was to subdue the Native Americans around Detroit before marching south into the Ohio Country. The second expedition, commanded by Colonel Bouquet, was to march west from Fort Pitt and form a second front in the Ohio Country.

Bradstreet set out from Fort Schlosser in early August 1764 with about 1,200 soldiers and a large contingent of Native allies enlisted by Sir William Johnson. Bradstreet felt that he did not have enough troops to subdue enemy Native Americans by force. When strong winds on Lake Erie forced him to stop at Presque Isle on August 12, he decided to negotiate a treaty with a delegation of Ohio Native Americans led by Guyasuta instead. Bradstreet exceeded his authority by conducting a peace treaty rather than a simple truce, and by agreeing to halt Bouquet's expedition, which had not yet left Fort Pitt. Gage, Johnson, and Bouquet were outraged when they learned what Bradstreet had done. Gage rejected the treaty, believing that Bradstreet had been convinced to abandoning his offensive in the Ohio Country. Gage may have been correct: the Ohio Native Americans did not return prisoners as promised in a second meeting with Bradstreet in September, and some Shawnees were trying to enlist French aid in order to continue the war.

Bradstreet continued westward. He did not know yet that his unauthorized diplomacy was angering his superiors. He reached Fort Detroit on August 26, where he negotiated another treaty. In an attempt to discredit Pontiac, who was not present, Bradstreet chopped up a peace belt the Ottawa leader had sent to the meeting. According to historian Richard White, "such an act, roughly equivalent to a European ambassador's urinating on a proposed treaty, had shocked and offended the gathered Indians." Bradstreet also claimed that the Native Americans had accepted British sovereignty as a result of his negotiations, but Johnson believed that this had not been fully explained to the Native Americans and that further councils would be needed. Although Bradstreet had successfully reinforced and reoccupied British forts in the region, his diplomacy proved to be controversial and inconclusive.

Colonel Bouquet was delayed in Pennsylvania while mustering the militia. He finally set out from Fort Pitt on October 3, 1764, with 1,150 men. He marched to the Muskingum River in the Ohio Country, within striking distance of a number of native villages. Now that treaties had been negotiated at Fort Niagara and Fort Detroit, the Ohio Native Americans were isolated and, with some exceptions, ready to make peace. In a council which began on October 17, Bouquet demanded that the Ohio Native Americans return all captives, including those not yet returned from the French and Indian War. Guyasuta and other leaders reluctantly handed over more than 200 captives, many of whom had been adopted into Native families. Because not all of the captives were present, the Native Americans were compelled to surrender hostages as a guarantee that the other captives would be returned. The Ohio Native Americans agreed to attend a more formal peace conference with William Johnson, which was finalized in July 1765.

The military conflict essentially ended with the 1764 expeditions. Some Native Americans still called for resistance in the Illinois Country, where British troops had yet to take possession of Fort de Chartres from the French. A Shawnee war chief named Charlot Kaské emerged as the most strident anti-British leader in the region, temporarily surpassing Pontiac in influence. Kaské traveled as far south as New Orleans in an effort to enlist French aid against the British.

In 1765, the British decided that the occupation of the Illinois Country could only be accomplished by diplomatic means. As Gage commented to one of his officers, he was determined to have "none our enemy" among the Indian peoples, and that included Pontiac, to whom he now sent a wampum belt suggesting peace talks. Pontiac had by now become less militant after hearing of Bouquet's truce with the Ohio country Native Americans. Johnson's deputy, George Croghan, travelled to the Illinois country in the summer of 1765. Even though he was injured along the way in an attack by Kickapoos and Mascoutens, he managed to meet and negotiate with Pontiac. While Charlot Kaské wanted to burn Croghan at the stake, Pontiac urged moderation and agreed to travel to New York, where he made a formal treaty with William Johnson at Fort Ontario on July 25, 1766. It was hardly a surrender: no lands were ceded, no prisoners returned, and no hostages were taken. Rather than accept British sovereignty, Kaské left British territory by crossing the Mississippi River with other French and Native refugees.

The total loss of life resulting from Pontiac's War is unknown. About 400 British soldiers were killed in action and perhaps 50 were captured and tortured to death. George Croghan estimated that 2,000 settlers had been killed or captured, a figure sometimes repeated as 2,000 settlers "killed". The violence compelled approximately 4,000 settlers from Pennsylvania and Virginia to flee from their homes. Native American losses went mostly unrecorded.

Pontiac's War has traditionally been portrayed as a defeat for the Native Americans. Scholars now usually view it as a military stalemate: while the Native Americans had failed to drive away the British, the British were unable to conquer the Native Americans. Negotiation and accommodation, rather than success on the battlefield, ultimately brought an end to the war. The Native Americans had in fact won a victory of sorts: They forced the British government to abandon Amherst's policies and instead create a relationship with the Native Americans modelled on the Franco-Native alliance.

Relations between British colonists and Native Americans, which had been severely strained during the French and Indian War, reached a new low during Pontiac's Rebellion. According to historian David Dixon, "Pontiac's War was unprecedented for its awful violence, as both sides seemed intoxicated with genocidal fanaticism." Historian Daniel Richter characterizes the Native attempt to drive out the British, and the effort of the Paxton Boys to eliminate Native Americans from their midst, as parallel examples of ethnic cleansing. People on both sides of the conflict had come to the conclusion that colonists and Native Americans were inherently different and could not live with each other. According to Richter, the war saw the emergence of "the novel idea that all Native people were 'Indians,' that all Euro-Americans were 'Whites,' and that all on one side must unite to destroy the other."

The British government also came to the conclusion that colonists and Native Americans must be kept apart. On October 7, 1763, the Crown issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, an effort to reorganize British North America after the Treaty of Paris. The Proclamation had already been worked on when Pontiac's War erupted. It was hurriedly issued after news of the uprising reached London. Officials drew a boundary line between the British colonies along the seaboard, and Native American lands west of the Allegheny Ridge (i.e., the Eastern Divide). This created a vast 'Indian Reserve' that stretched from the Alleghenies to the Mississippi River and from Florida to Quebec. It also confirmed the demarcation line that had been set before the war by the Treaty of Easton in 1758. By forbidding colonists from trespassing on Native lands, the British government hoped to avoid more conflicts like Pontiac's Rebellion. "The Royal Proclamation," writes historian Colin Calloway, "reflected the notion that segregation not interaction should characterize Indian-white relations."

The effects of Pontiac's War lasted for a long time. Because the Proclamation officially recognized that indigenous people had certain rights to the lands they occupied, it has been called the Native Americans' "Bill of Rights", and still informs the relationship between the Canadian government and First Nations. For British colonists and land speculators, however, the Proclamation seemed to deny them the fruits of victory—western lands—that had been won in the war with France. The resentment which this created undermined colonial attachment to the Empire. It also contributed to the coming of the American Revolution. According to Colin Calloway, "Pontiac's Revolt was not the last American war for independence—American colonists launched a rather more successful effort a dozen years later, prompted in part by the measures the British government took to try to prevent another war like Pontiac's."

For Native Americans, Pontiac's War demonstrated the possibilities of cooperation between tribes for resisting colonial expansion. Although the conflict divided tribes and villages, the war also saw the first extensive multi-tribal resistance to European colonization in North America, and was the first war between Europeans and Native North Americans that did not end in complete defeat for the Native Americans. The Proclamation of 1763 ultimately did not prevent British colonists and land speculators from expanding westward, and so Native Americans found it necessary to form new resistance movements. Beginning with conferences hosted by Shawnees in 1767, in the following decades leaders such as Joseph Brant, Alexander McGillivray, Blue Jacket, and Tecumseh would attempt to forge confederacies that would revive the resistance efforts of Pontiac's War.

The work had success: In 1998 he got to the Taiwanese National team.

After getting in the National team he played his first World Tour tournament. At the Austrian Open he reached the quarterfinals in the singles and doubles and made headlines. In 1999 he was nominated by coaches and players to come to Germany. The hard times for mother and son went on. It was difficult for Chuang to be a friend of German table tennis players because he doesn't speak German. He had no assistant for matches or in the training, so he had no coach. But he was very diligent and became very soon the best player in Germany. In 2002 he came back to Taiwan.

At several World Tour events he reached the final. In the Asian Games he beat Kong Linghui. In the final he lost to Wang Liqin. At the Grand Finals at the end of the year 2002 he won his first singles title. He beat again Kong Linghui. In the quarterfinals he beat Jean-Michel Saive.

Already in 2002 he was the best Taiwanese table tennis player. In 2003 he climbed from place 40 in the world rankings to place 7. His mother was very proud and trained very hard with him, too. She's a very important coach of him. In 2003 he played his first World Championships but lost in the Round of 16 to Joo Se-hyuk. In the doubles he lost, too. Chuang played more international events but he didn't win. In this year he won World Tour Brasilia Open. 2011 in Chile and 2012 in Spain he won these tournaments, too. At the London 2012 Olympics he beat in the quarterfinals Adrian Crișan and reached the semi finals- the fourth place was his for sure. In a spectacular match against China's Wang Hao he lost 2:4. At the bronze medal match he had the chance to win. In a very important match for Chuang he lost 2:4 too and got the fourth place. With the team he got place 5-9. Despite these losses it was Chuang's best placement at Olympics. In 2013 he took part in the World Championships, where he got his best position ever- the quarterfinals. In the doubles he reached the 1st place after beating a Chinese duo in the final. This was the first gold for Taiwan. At the World Cups from (2004-2015) he reached the quarterfinals six times . 2014 he won bronze with the Taiwanese team at the WTTC. At the Pro Tour Grand Finals he only reached the quarterfinals. At the WTTC 2015 he lost in his first match against Ádám Pattantyús. At the World Cup, where he played for the 7th time, he reached the quarterfinals again. At the Pro Tour Grand Finals (today World Tour Grand Finals) he didn't reach the final and slipped to place 14 in the world rankings. At the WTTC 2016 the team of Taiwan was only in 17th place. At the Olympics 2016 Chuang lost in a strong match against Ma Long and became a place from 1-32. In this year he was dated from Chen Chien-An and was from that moment not the best Taiwanese table tennis player. At Asian Games and World Cups he fell back to place 34. But through reaching Round 16 at the WTTC 2017 in Düsseldorf he climbed back to place 7.

Royalty payment

A royalty is a payment made to someone for the use of something, an asset, that they have created or own. For example a musician who writes a song is paid a royalty each time the song is played on the radio, or each time another musician plays the song. The owner can allow other people to use their asset by paying a license or a franchise. The amount paid is usually a percentage of the all the money made from using the asset, the gross, or from the just the profit, the net. Another way is to set a fixed price, for example a set amount for each book or recording. There are many other ways that the royalty fee can be calculated and paid. A royalty interest is the right to collect a stream of future royalty payments.

A license agreement defines the terms for these payments. The agreement can also set conditions for how, where and when an asset can be used. License agreements can also be regulated. A government of a country might receive royalty payments for mining, or extracting oil, and would protect its interest in the agreement with laws.

Shill

A shill is a 'plant' or stooge. They are people, usually paid, who promote something while pretending to be independent.

Shills publicly help or give credibility to a person or organization with which they have a private relationship. Shills operate in media, journalism, marketing, confidence games, or other business areas. A shill may also discredit opponents or critics of their client by character assassination or other means.

Usually, "shill" refers to someone who purposely gives onlookers, or "marks", the impression of an enthusiastic customer. They pretend independence of the seller, marketer or "con artist", for whom they are secretly working. 

The shill works for "the man" who does the tricks to extract money from the onlookers. The arena can be as basic as a street three-shell game, or as complex as a massive stock exchange fraud. All it takes is someone who looks like a fellow player to show big appreciation of the seller's product.

The shill and his client ("the man") rely on crowd psychology to encourage other onlookers or audience members to do business with the seller or accept the ideas they are promoting. With a big audience, such as a magician's show or a political rally, there are placed people in the audience very often. Then the shill is called a plant or stooge.

What the shill does is similar or identical to what advertising and public relations do. However, it is more obvious that the latter have a vested interest because everyone knows they are being paid for their work. Another place for shilling is the many web auctions.

1984 Barneveld–Black Earth tornado

The 1984 Barneveld tornado occurred in Barneveld, Wisconsin on June 8, 1984.

Tornadoes began braking out on the afternoon of June 7 across North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri. Three people were killed in Missouri by a tornado and one person was killed in Iowa just after 9:00 p.m. CDT. The severe weather then shifted into Wisconsin where a tornado watch went out at 11:00 p.m. CDT, but most of Barneveld had gone to bed that night.

A supercell thunderstorm which produced a tornado in Iowa at 9:00 p.m. CT entered Wisconsin from the Iowa/Illinois border at midnight. At 12:30 a.m., the first tornado touched down in Lafayette County. At 12:41 a.m., the tornado drove through Barneveld. A sharp bolt of lightning as well as a loud clap of thunder cut the power to the city, awakening residents. Other tornadoes broke out before dissipating after 3:00 a.m. CDT.

The tornado was rated an F5 and killed 9 people and injured 200 others as well as $25 million in damage. It was the last F5 tornado to occur at night until the Birmingham, Alabama tornado in April 1998.

1980 Grand Island tornado

The 1980 Grand Island tornado occurred on June 3, 1980 in Grand Island, Nebraska.

The previous day tornadoes were reported in Iowa, Indiana, and Ohio. Several more tornadoes broke out on that day in Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, and Nebraska. On the evening of Wednesday, June 3, a slow-moving supercell thunderstorm developed over Nebraska.

The result was the most unusual in American weather history: these storms moved at 8 mph, some of these tornadoes were anticyclonic, and they didn't move in a straight line, with some looping back around. Tornado warnings were issued.

5 people were killed and 200 were injured. June 3 is known as The Night of the Twisters, which is a book written by Ivy Ruckman in 1984, and a movie that premiered on February 14, 1996 on The Family Channel (now Freeform).

In human anatomy, the thigh is the area between the hip (pelvis) and the knee. Anatomically, it is part of the human leg.

The single bone in the thigh is called the femur. This bone is very thick and strong (due to the high proportion of bone tissue), and forms a ball and socket joint at the hip, and a modified hinge joint at the knee.

2018 FIFA World Cup Final

The 2018 FIFA World Cup Final was the last game of the tournament. It happened on July 15, 2018, at Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia. The teams playing were France and Croatia. In 2018, the tournament was the 21st edition organized by FIFA, which is in charge of football competitions worldwide. A total of 32 teams took part. The winners of the World Cup would have qualified for the 2021 FIFA Confederations Cup (however FIFA got rid of the Confederations Cup later on). Russia, where the tournament was held, was automatically included, and the other 31 teams were selected through qualifying matches organized by FIFA's six groups. The teams were divided into groups for the initial matches. From these groups, 16 teams moved forward to the knockout stage. 

Before reaching the final, France won their group by beating two teams and drawing one. They went on to beat Argentina, Uruguay, and Belgium in the later rounds. Croatia also won their group by winning all three matches. They then won against Denmark and Russia through penalty shootouts and England in the semi-final. The final match was watched by many people both at the stadium and on TV. The referee for the match was Néstor Pitana from Argentina. 

France scored the first goal through a free kick that turned into an own goal by Mario Mandžukić. Croatia later equalized with a goal from Ivan Perišić. France was awarded a penalty after the referee consulted a video review. Antoine Griezmann scored from the penalty. France continued to score more goals, winning the match 4-2. This victory was France's second World Cup win. They previously won in 1998. The best player of the match was Antoine Griezmann from France, and Luka Modrić from Croatia received the Golden Ball award for being the best player of the tournament. The final was the highest-scoring one since 1966. The coach of the French team, Didier Deschamps, spoke about how his experience as a player in the 1998 World Cup was connected to the current team's success. The Croatian coach, Zlatko Dalić, congratulated France but criticized the penalty decision. In the Euro 2020 tournament that took place in 2021, both France and Croatia reached the round of 16 but were eliminated in the later stages.

The 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st time they had the World Cup. It's a big football competition for teams from different countries. They held it in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018. Russia didn't have to qualify because they were the hosts. Other 208 teams tried to qualify in matches organized by FIFA between June 2015 and November 2017. They split into six groups. In the main games, they put the teams into eight groups of four. Each team played against the others once. Then, the best two teams from each group went on to another stage where if they lost, they were out.

In the last World Cup in 2014, Germany won. But this time, they didn't do well. They were kicked out in the group games in 2018. France had won before in 1998 when they beat Brazil. They had also come second in 2006 when Italy beat them. They reached the quarter-finals in the World Cup before this one, and they got second place in the Euro 2016. Croatia had never been in a final before. They had a good team with players like Luka Modrić, Ivan Rakitić, and Mario Mandžukić. People said this was a special generation for them. The final was the sixth time France and Croatia played against each other. France had won three times and two times they drew.

The ball they used in the final game was called the Telstar Mechta. It was red and based on the Telstar 18, the ball they used in the knockout stage. The Telstar family of balls is like the 1970 Telstar one. It looks like the Brazuca ball from 2014 but a bit different.

France was seen as the top choice by experts to win the 2018 World Cup. They got into the tournament by finishing first in their qualifying group, ahead of Sweden and the Netherlands. In the tournament, they were in Group C with Australia, Denmark, and Peru. Their first match was against Australia on 16 June at Kazan Arena. France won 2–1. Antoine Griezmann got the first goal from a penalty decided with video help. Australia scored a penalty too, and then France got the winning goal through an own goal by Australian defender Aziz Behich. Next, France played against Peru and won 1–0 with a goal from 19-year-old Kylian Mbappé. This made him the youngest player from France to score in a major tournament. France's win meant they could rest key players in the last group match against Denmark, which ended in a draw. This helped France win the group. In the round of 16, France played against Argentina on 30 June and won 4–3. Griezmann scored early with a penalty, and Argentina scored twice. Benjamin Pavard leveled the game, and then Mbappé scored two quick goals. Argentina got one more goal, but Mbappé's great play was highlighted. France's quarter-final match against Uruguay on 6 July ended in a 2–0 victory with goals from Raphaël Varane and Griezmann. In the semi-final, they played against Belgium and won 1–0. Samuel Umtiti scored the winning goal from a corner kick.

In their qualifying group, Croatia came in second place after Iceland. This meant they had to play more matches to qualify. They played against Greece in these matches and won over two games. They won the first game 4-1 and the second game ended in a draw with no goals. In the main tournament, Croatia was placed in group D with Argentina, Iceland, and Nigeria. This was considered a tough group because Argentina was very skilled, and Nigeria had a strong history. In their first match, Croatia won 2-0 against Nigeria. The goals were scored by the other team accidentally putting the ball into their own goal and a penalty scored by one of Croatia's players. One of Croatia's strikers, Nikola Kalinić, didn't play in the match due to back pain. The coach, Zlatko Dalić, removed him from the team. This left Croatia with fewer players for the rest of the tournament. Croatia played against Argentina next and won 3-0. They scored their first goal when Argentina's goalkeeper made a mistake, and then scored two more goals. Argentina's captain, Lionel Messi, didn't play very well in this match. Croatia also won against Iceland with a score of 2-1. They rested some of their main players in this match because they had already qualified for the next round.

In the next stage of the tournament, Croatia played against Denmark. The match ended in a 1-1 draw and they had to do a penalty shootout to decide the winner. Croatia won the shootout 3-2, with their goalkeeper making important saves. Croatia's next match was in the quarter-finals against Russia. The match ended in a 2-2 draw after extra time, and Croatia won the penalty shootout 4-3. This was the second time in the World Cup that Croatia won a penalty shootout. During the tournament, there was a situation where one of Croatia's players, Vida, shouted something that caused problems with Russian fans. In the semi-finals, Croatia played against England. They were losing initially but managed to score two goals and win the match 2-1 in extra time. By winning this match, Croatia became the first team in the World Cup to come from behind and win three times in the same tournament.

Croatia started the match at 6 pm local time (3 pm UTC) when it was 27°C (81°F) and 51% humid. There were 78,011 people in the stadium and about 1.12 billion people watching on TV around the world. The weather at Sheremetyevo International Airport, which is 30 kilometres (19 miles) away, was partly cloudy when the match began. The game was played during a small thunderstorm with visible lightning strikes. "The Guardian's" Barry Glendenning said that Croatia played better in the first 15 minutes. He noticed that France had trouble getting out of their own side of the field, while Croatia was in control. But, France scored first in the 18th minute. They got a free kick around 30 yards (27 metres) from the goal because Marcelo Brozović fouled Griezmann. Griezmann took the free kick and passed it into the penalty area, where Mandžukić tried to head it away, but it accidentally went into the goal. This was the first own goal in a World Cup final. N'Golo Kanté got a yellow card in the 28th minute for a foul on Perišić. A minute later, Croatia scored when Perišić was fouled 40 yards (37 metres) from the goal. Modrić kicked a free kick to the far goalpost, Vrsaljko headed it back across the goal, and Perišić kicked it low into the corner for a goal.

Three minutes later, Griezmann took a corner kick into the penalty area. Matuidi tried to score with a header, but it didn't work. The France players asked for a penalty, saying Perišić touched the ball with his hand while guarding Matuidi. The video assistant referee talked to the main referee and after watching the video for a few minutes, they gave France a penalty. Griezmann took the penalty kick in the 38th minute and scored by kicking it low into the left corner. In the 43rd minute, Lucas Hernandez got a yellow card for a foul on Rebić. Then Perišić shot the ball towards the goal, but it was deflected by Paul Pogba for a corner. Just before the first half ended, Croatia had a corner kick. Rakitić kicked it into the penalty area, and Vida had a chance to score with his head, but he missed the goal. The first half ended with France leading 2–1, even though they only had one shot on goal and had the ball for 34% of the time. During halftime, experts on TV talked about whether France's goals were fair. Alan Shearer and Rio Ferdinand on BBC One said that the free kick for the first goal and the penalty for the second should not have been given. Shearer called the penalty decision "ridiculous" and said the handball was not on purpose. Chris Waddle, on BBC Radio 5 Live, thought the penalty was right, saying "I would have given it. Perišić used his hand to stop the ball." Gabriele Marcotti of ESPN said it was a difficult decision that could have gone either way, even after watching the replay.

A group of people (pitch invaders) came onto the field during the second half of the Croatian attack, but security officers removed them. A Russian feminist rock band and protest group called Pussy Riot said they caused the interruption. Three minutes into the second half, Croatia had a chance to score. Rebić kicked the ball towards the goal from the left side, after Rakitić passed it to him. The French goalkeeper Hugo Lloris used one hand to stop the ball and sent it out for a corner. Someone named Glendenning said Croatia started the second half just like the first, very strong. In the 52nd minute, France had a chance. Mbappé got the ball from Pogba and ran down the left side. He went past Vida and shot at the goal, but Subašić saved the ball. In the 55th minute, France swapped Nzonzi in for Kanté. They scored again in the 59th minute. Pogba passed to Mbappé on the right side with a long pass. Mbappé then passed to Griezmann, who gave the ball back to Pogba outside the penalty area. Pogba shot at the goal. The ball hit a defender and came back to Pogba. He shot again, and Subašić couldn't stop it from going into the Croatian goal.

France had another chance in the 63rd minute. Giroud kicked the ball towards Griezmann with a bicycle kick. Griezmann was close to the goal without anyone marking him. But Brozović took the ball from him. Two minutes later, France scored again. Mbappé kicked the ball from 25 yards away. The ball went past Vida and Subašić and into the Croatian goal. Mbappé was only the second teenager to score in a World Cup final. The first was Pelé, who did it in 1958. Croatia got their second goal in the 69th minute. Lloris couldn't control a back-pass, and Mandžukić took the loose ball and put it in the empty net with his right leg. Even though Croatia put pressure on towards the end, the match ended with France winning 4–2. This was the highest-scoring World Cup final since 1966 and the first one since 2002 that didn't need extra time to decide the winner.

Vermont Republic

The Vermont Republic was a country that existed from 1777 to 1791. It was located on land that was claimed by New York and New Hampshire. It had its own postal system, military, and currency. Even though it had a government, it was not respected by Great Britain or the Continental Congress.

New York and New Hampshire both claimed that Vermont was in their control. This argument was caused by the New Hampshire Grants. The governor of New Hampshire wrote 135 grants giving 6 square miles of land each to create towns. New York also made grants in the same areas.

In January 1777 it was made independent as "New Connecticut". In June, the name was changed to "Vermont". On July 2, 1777, representatives of nearby Vermont towns met in Windsor. They wanted to leave New York and form their own country under a new constitution. The Vermont Constitution was designed to be like the Pennsylvania Constitution, and was very democratic. Adult slavery was banned in Vermont. This made Vermont the first state to not allow slavery. They gave all adult males the right to vote. In the past, only people who owned land could vote. The constitution outlined how eminent domain would work in Vermont, which is where the government can take private property if they pay the owners. It also ordered public schools to be made.

Vermont sent representatives to the United States, the Netherlands, and France to try to discuss peace and trade. They wanted to join the United States as the fourteenth state. Money made in 1785 and 1786 said "STELLA QUARTA DECIMA" on it, which means "the fourteenth star" in Latin.

New York did not want Vermont to become a state because they still said the land was their own. In 1790, representatives of both states met and decided that Vermont would pay $30,000 to New York in exchange for New York respecting the border between the two states at Lake Champlain. After this, Vermont became the 14th state in 1791. At that time, the population was about 85,000.

The Green Mountain Boys were the militia and only military force of Vermont. They began in 1775 after an argument about land between New York and New Hampshire. 

The militia was lead by Major General Ethan Allen, who was born in Vermont and was in the military from 1757 (British Army) until 1780 (Vermont militia).

In 1780, 300 soldiers of the Green Mountain Boys defended against 307 British and Iroquois soldiers in the Royalton raid. The British and Iroquois attacked Vermont as a part of many raids by the British in the American Revolutionary War.

The Green Mountain Boys fought with the Continental Army in the Battle of Ticonderoga and the Battle of Bennington.

Battle of Puebla

The Battle of Puebla took place on 5 May 1862, near Puebla City in Mexico. It was part of  the "Second French intervention in Mexico". The Mexican Army won over the occupying French soldiers.

The French eventually overran the Mexicans in other battles. However, the Mexican victory at Puebla against a much better equipped and larger French army gave a morale boost to the Mexican army. It  also slowed the French army's advance towards Mexico City.

The 1858–60 Mexican civil war (known as the "Reform War") caused major distress in Mexico's economy. When he was elected president in 1861, Benito Juárez was forced to stop payments of interest on foreign debts for two years.

At the end of October 1861 diplomats from Spain, France, and Britain met in London to form the Tripartite Alliance. The main purpose of this alliance was to launch an allied invasion of Mexico, to take control of Veracruz, its major port. The idea was to force the Mexican government to negotiate terms for repaying its debts and for reparations for harm to foreign citizens in Mexico. In December 1861, Spanish troops landed in Veracruz; British and French followed in early January.

The allied forces occupied Veracruz and advanced to Orizaba. The Tripartite Alliance fell apart by early April 1862, when it became clear the French wanted to impose harsh demands on the Juarez government and provoke a war. The British and Spanish withdrew, leaving the French to march alone on Mexico City. Napoleon III wanted to set up a puppet Mexican regime.

Jurong Region MRT line

The Jurong Region Line (JRL) is a Mass Rapid Transit line opening in 2026 that is in the western part of Singapore. It reaches north to Choa Chu Kang, south to Jurong Pier, west to Peng Kang Hill and east to Pandan Reservoir. The line will be the seventh MRT line to be built. 

The JRL is the third MRT line in Singapore to be constructed with tracks that are above ground, after the East West Line and the North South Line, and the first MRT line to be built fully above ground, with no parts that are underground or at the ground level.

The line is colored turquoise on the MRT Rail map.

The line mainly serves Jurong and the nearby areas. The line is split into three parts, or branches:


Trains starting at Choa Chu Kang will end at Jurong Pier. Trains starting at Jurong Pier will end at Peng Kang Hill. Lastly, trains starting at Peng Kang Hill will go towards Choa Chu Kang, with Bahar Junction as an interchange point for the 3 services. People who want to change to trains on the east branch can only do so at Tengah. 

Studies for an extension to connect the east branch to the Circle Line at Haw Par Villa are being done.

As early as 1996, plans were made to allow a railway to go to the Nanyang Technological University, from the rest of Singapore. The white paper published by the Land Transport Authority showed that a Light Rail Transit line would run west of Boon Lay station on the East West line towards the university. The JRL was created as a concept, but was dropped because not many people were expected to use the line at that time.

However, in 2013, the JRL was announced again, as a Mass Rapid Transit line that would run from Choa Chu Kang, crossing Boon Lay and Tengah, Jurong East, Jurong Industrial Estate and Jurong West.

Details of the line were announced on 9 May 2018, as a 24-kilometre line with 24 stations. The Choa Chu Kang Bus Interchange, 1 HDB block, and Pioneer Primary School will all be taken by the government for the building of the line.

JRL will start opening in 3 phases from 2026 to 2028.

The JRL has 24 kilometres (15 mi) of tracks, with 24 stations. There are four branches: to Choa Chu Kang in the north, Jurong Pier in the south, Pandan Reservoir in the east and Peng Kang Hill in the west.

There will be a depot at Tengah and a parking area near Peng Kang Hill station to support the operations of the JRL. Rolling stock will be kept at both locations, which will have parking areas for JRL trains. The Tengah Depot, which will also house the JRL Operations Control Centre, will have a bus depot and a workers’ sleeping area combined with it to use the land better. The Peng Kang Hill parking area is located near Peng Kang Hill station, while Tengah depot is located along the western side of Tengah.

The JRL is operated by three-car trains that can be made to become four cars when the number of people using the line goes up. Each car is 18.6 metres long by 2.75 metres wide, which is smaller than those used on other MRT lines because the JRL is above ground and the trains have to run along places with many buildings.

This proposed extension from West Coast to Haw Par Villa via Pasir Panjang would connect the JRL to the Circle line and improve the ability to travel between the western part of Singapore and the Central Business District. It would support the future developments along the JRL, and increase the strength of the Mass Rapid Transit network. New stations would be added in West Coast and Pasir Panjang. The plan was announced in 2015, and as of 2017, studies are ongoing for the proposed extension. If built, the extension would be ready in 2030.

Zodiac Killer

The Zodiac Killer was a serial killer who operated in Northern California from at least the late 1960s to the early 1970s. The killer's identity remains unknown. The Zodiac murdered victims in Benicia, Vallejo, Lake Berryessa, and San Francisco between December 1968 and October 1969. Four men and three women between the ages of 16 and 29 were targeted. The killer originated the name "Zodiac" in a series of taunting letters sent to the local Bay Area press. These letters included four cryptograms (or ciphers). Of the four cryptograms sent, only one has been definitively solved.
Suspects have been named by law enforcement and amateur investigators, mainly led by Dave Toschi. Still no conclusive evidence has surfaced. The San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) marked the case "inactive" in April 2004, but re-opened it at some point prior to March 2007. The case also remains open in the city of Vallejo, as well as in Napa County and Solano County. The California Department of Justice has maintained an open case file on the Zodiac murders since 1969. 

Although the Zodiac claimed 37 murders in letters to the newspapers, investigators agree on only seven confirmed victims, two of whom survived. They are:

Wulingyuan

Wulingyuan ) is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in south-central China's Hunan Province. 

The site has over 3,000 quartzite sandstone pillars and peaks, many over in height. There are many ravines and gorges with attractive streams, pools, lakes, rivers and waterfalls. 

There are 40 caves, many with large calcite deposits. There are two natural bridges, Xianrenqiao ("Bridge of the Immortals") and Tianqiashengkong ("Bridge Across the Sky").

The site is between and . This is about to the northwest of Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province. The park covers an area of 690 square kilometers (266 square miles). 

Wulingyuan is part of the Wuling Mountain Range. The scenic area has four national parks. Overall there are over 560 attraction sights to view.

Upland and lowland

Upland and lowland are terms used in ecology, physical geography and geology. They describe the relative height of land above sea level.

Uplands have rivers and streams which are fast-flowing, clear, and with plenty of oxygen. They drain high or mountainous country, and go down into broad plains (where they become lowland rivers. Lowlands usually have warmer, slow-flowing waters carrying lots of sediment and with poor oxygen content.

Upland rivers run fast and cut through rock (Colorado River). Lowland rivers meander slowly towards the coast (Mississippi River). They carry lots of soil and are a dark colour. Therefore the fish and other animals which live in the river are quite different according to the two stages or types of river.

The terms also apply to large areas of land. Because mountain-building (orogeny) lifts up huge sections of the Earth, there are large areas which are well above sea level: the highlands. But on the trailing edge of a continent, the land is low. So the Americas are (broadly speaking) high on the west (the American Cordillera) and low on the east (Amazon, St. Lawrence River / Great Lakes basin, Mississippi, and La Plata). This is a consequence of plate tectonics, as the Americas have moved slowly west for over 100 million years. The Appalachians are a far older chain of ground-down mountains carried along by the continent as it moved west.

The same pattern can be seen in other continents, especially with great rivers such as the Congo and the Indus. Australia is the exception: its mountain ranges are very ancient and worn down. Recent plate tectonics there has not been so significant as elsewhere.

Anna Sewell

Anna Sewell (30 March 1820 – 25 April 1878) was an English novelist. She is best known as the author of the 1877 novel "Black Beauty," one of the top ten best selling novels for children ever written.

Anna Sewell was born in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. After a childhood injury, she was confined to her house, and got around largely by carriage horse. Sewell spent her last years writing the children's classic "Black Beauty" (1877), a fictional autobiography of a gentle, highbred horse. She died of hepatitis in 1878, just five months after her book was published.

Sewell’s concern for the humane treatment of horses began early in life. Crippled at a young age, she had difficulty walking, but she could drive a horse-drawn carriage. Her father took the train to work, and she drove her father to and from the station. Later, after reading an essay on animals by Horace Bushnell, she stated that one of her goals in writing was “to induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding treatment of horses.”

Sewell’s introduction to writing began in her youth when she helped edit the works of her mother—a deeply religious, popular author of juvenile best-sellers. Sewell spent the last seven or eight years of her life—confined to her house as an invalid—writing Black Beauty. The book, a fictional autobiography of a gentle highbred horse, had a strong moral purpose. It may have helped abolish the cruel practice of using the checkrein.

LGBT rights at the United Nations

Discussions of LGBT rights at the United Nations have included resolutions and joint statements in the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC). 

Since its founding in 1945, the United Nations political bodies had not discussed LGBT rights (regarding equality regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity) until September 1995. In the negotiations on the Draft of the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action, sexual orientation became a topic of debate at the 4th World Conference on Women. These discussions on "sexual orientation" can not be found in the text of the meetings. Nevertheless, it was the first time governments had an explicit opinion in favour or against the inclusion and recognition of sexual orientation. Beverley Palesa Ditsie became the first openly lesbian person to address the United Nations regarding LGBT issues, calling for States to adopt resolutions that recognized sexual diversity. 


Indian Penal Code

The Indian Penal Code (IPC) is the main criminal code of modern India. It is a code meant to cover all aspects of criminal law. The code was drafted on 6th October 1860. on the recommendation of first law commission of india established in 1834 under the charter Act of 1833 under the chairmanship of Thomas Babington Macaulay.It came into force in British India during the early British Raj period in 1862. However, it did not apply automatically in the Princely states. They had their own courts and legal systems until the 1940s. The Code has been amended several times and is now supplemented by other criminal provisions.

After the Partition of the British Indian Empire, the Indian Penal Code was inherited by its successor states, the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan (where it continues as the Pakistan Penal Code). After the separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan, the code continued in force there. The code was also adopted by the British colonial authorities in colonial Burma, Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka), the Straits Settlements (now part of Malaysia), Singapore and Brunei. It is the basis of the criminal codes in those countries.

Pakistani nationality law

The Pakistani nationality law are the laws on citizenship of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The main law on nationality, the Pakistan Citizenship Act, was passed by the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan on 13 April 1951. Pakistan is the only country in Asia with unconditional "jus soli" citizenship rights.

Before the creation of Pakistan, it was part of the British Indian Empire which also included India and Bangladesh. The people were British subjects. Pakistan was founded on 14 August 1947 as a state for Muslims. It was a Dominion in the British Commonwealth. Pakistan then included modern-day Bangladesh, which was known as East Bengal and East Pakistan. Bangladesh became independent from Pakistan in 1971. After independence in 1947, several millions of Muslims emigrated to Pakistan from India, and several millions of Hindus and Sikhs who had been living in Pakistan emigrated to India. This raised a number of citizenship issues.

The Pakistan Citizenship Act became law on 13 April 1951. Its purpose was "to make provision for citizenship of Pakistan". The Act has been amended several times, the last time in 2000. The Act is divided into 23 sections, each one about a different provision of citizenship.

Since independence, many Pakistanis have moved to live in the Middle East, Europe and North America. This has led to several changes in Pakistani nationality law. Dual citizenship is allowed in certain cases:

Pakistanis with dual citizenship can not hold public office, sit in the assemblies, contest elections or join the Pakistani military.

Both Pakistan and India claim to the disputed region of Kashmir. This has been the subject of several wars between the two countries. The Pakistani Citizenship Act of 1951 allowed persons who were subjects of the state of Jammu and Kashmir to travel under a Pakistani passport and be considered a citizen of Pakistan.

The independence of Bangladesh in 1971 led to around half a million "stranded Pakistanis". These people trace their heritage to the Bihar region. Despite official promises, Bangladesh refuses to accept them as citizens. Conversely, a continuous migration of Bangladeshis between 1971 and 1995 led their population increasing to more 1.6 million. There were only 10,000 at the time of separation. The migrants are mostly illegal and are not given the citizenship, as they migrated after the separation.

For political and other reasons, the 1.5 million registered Afghan refugees in Pakistan are not given Pakistani nationality, even though most of them were born in Pakistan.


Child labour in Pakistan

Child labour is one of the major problems of Pakistan: The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan estimated in the 1990s, that 11 million children were working in the country; half of them were under the age of ten. 
There are a number of laws which tells when children are allowed to work. These laws include:

The problem is that these laws are ignored most of the time. Some 11 million children, aged four to fourteen, keep the country's factories working, often working in bad conditions.
In December 2014, the U.S. Department of Labor's "List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor" reported nine goods of which six are produced by child workers in Pakistan. These include the making of bricks, carpets, glass bangles, leather and surgical instruments, as well as coal mining.

It continues to be active in campaigning for LGBT rights and Intersex human rights on the international Human rights and Civil rights scene, and regularly petitions the United Nations and governments. ILGA is represented in 110+ countries across the world. ILGA is accredited by the United Nations and has been granted NGO Ecosoc consultative status.

Sex work

Carol Leigh first used the terms sex worker and sex work in 1978, to refer to prostitution, and related concepts. By using this new term, Leigh wanted to avoid the negative connotations. Sex work is paid work in the industry, such as prostitution, erotic dancing, and starring in pornographic movies. It does not refer to related illegal activities, such as human trafficking or other non-consensual sex.

It is difficult to say how many sex workers there are. This is because of the stigma of being a sex worker. In addition, most academic work focuses on prostitution, escorts and exotic dancing; there is little research on other forms of sex work.

Interviews with men and women escorts show gender differences in these escorts' experiences. On average, women escorts charged much more than men. Compared to traditional women escorts, women in niche markets charged lower rates. However, this difference in rates did not exist for men escorts. Men escorts reported widespread acceptance in the gay community; they were much more likely to tell about their occupation. This community acceptance is fairly unusual to the gay community and not the experience of many women sex workers. Also, heterosexual men prostitutes are much more likely than heterosexual women prostitutes to entertain same-gender clients because they need to: most clients are men. In general, there is a greater social expectation for women to engage in emotional labor than there is for men; there are also greater consequences if they do not.

The last verse of book I is:

The great souled Sramana, who has put an end to his delusive vision, who is expert in scriptures and who has established himself in conduct free from attachment, is qualified as Dharma.
The first verse of book II is:

The object of knowledge is made up of substances, which are said to be characterised by qualities, and with which, moreover, are (associated) the modifications; those, who are deluded by modifications, are false believers.

The last verse of book II is:

Therefore, thus realizing the soul as the knower by nature, I give up the notion of mineness and have come to adopt the (notion of) non-attachment.
The first verse of Appendix is:

Having saluted the Siddhas, the foremost great Jinas and the saints have 
The last verse of Appendix is:

He, who practising the course of duties of a house-holder and of a monk, comprehends this doctrine, realizes, within a short time, the essence of the doctrine (the Self).

Palestinian National Authority

The Gaza-Jericho agreement of 1994 established an organisation to rule the Gaza Strip, and parts of the West Bank. This organization was called Palestinian National Authority (PA or PNA; ""). This followed from the 1993 Oslo Accords for which The Nobel Peace Prize 1994 was awarded jointly to Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin "for their efforts to create peace in the Middle East.". After the elections in 2006 and the Fatah-Hamas conflict the Palestinian Authority only had control over the areas in the West Bank. Since January 2013, the Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority uses the name "State of Palestine" on official documents.

On the morning of 26 February 2024, the entire PNA government resigned from office. This included the prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh. The mass-resignation came from popular opposition to the Palestinian Authority and pressure from the United States during the Israel–Hamas war.

Jus soli

Jus soli (), means "right of the soil". This is often called birthright citizenship. This is the right of anyone born in a country to have nationality or citizenship.

"Jus soli" was part of the common law. It was different to "jus sanguinis", from the Roman law that became part of the civil-law systems of continental Europe. Where it exists, there are often conditions. For example, some countries deny citizenship to children of foreign diplomats. 

Almost all states in Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania grant citizenship at birth based upon the principle of "jus sanguinis" (right of blood). Citizenship is inherited through parents not by birthplace. Sometimes it can be a version of "jus soli" in which citizenship by birthplace is automatic only for the children of certain immigrants.

Sanqingshan

Sanqingshan is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in China. It is based on Mount Sanqing, which is a renowned Taoist sacred mountain.

The mountain is north of Yushan County in Jiangxi Province, China. It has outstanding scenery. There are three main summits: Yujing, Yushui, and Yuhua, symbolising the Taoist trinity.

Mount Sanqing is a national park of China. It is a famous "honeypot" (place for tourists) and a home of over 2300 species of plants and 400 species of vertebrates. The total area of Mount Sanqing is 229 km². It became a National Geopark in 2005 and a World Heritage Site in 2008.

These granite mountains hold the evidence of a billion years of geological evolution. This includes the evidence of important geological events, such as the amalgamation of the supercontinent Rodinia.

Transcriptome

The transcriptome is the set of all RNA molecules in one cell or a population of cells. RNA transcribes the base sequence from DNA by the process called transcription. The term 'transcriptome' is sometimes used to refer to all RNAs, or just mRNA, depending on the particular experiment.

It includes only those RNA molecules found in a particular cell population. It usually includes the amount or concentration of each RNA molecule, and the molecular identities. It differs from the exome: that refers only to the bits of RNA which do code for proteins.

In the human genome, about 5% of all genes get transcribed into RNA.

The transcriptome is coding mRNA (about 1-4% of its entirety) and non-coding RNAs (the rest). Non-coding RNAs do not give rise to proteins. The number of non-protein-coding sequences increases in more complex organisms.

Exome

The exome is the part of the genome composed of exons. In RNA, introns are removed by RNA splicing. That leaves the sections of the RNA which actually code for the final protein. Exome sequencing is the way researchers find the causes of many inherited diseases.

DNA damage theory of ageing

The DNA damage theory of ageing is that ageing happens because damage happens in the individual's DNA. The damage accumulates (builds up) even though there are cell mechanisms that repair most of the damage.

Although both mitochondrial and the cell nucleus may have DNA damage, nuclear DNA is the main subject of this analysis.

List of most luminous stars

This list of most luminous stars is of Milky Way and Magellanic Cloud objects. A few stars in other local group galaxies can be seen in enough detail to work out their the luminosities. The list is more or less complete for stars down to 2,000,000 times the luminosity of the Sun.

Despite their extreme luminosity, many of these stars are too distant to be observed with the naked eye. Stars that are at least sometimes visible to the unaided eye have their apparent magnitude (6.5 or brighter) highlighted in blue.

Determiner

In linguistics, a determiner (abbreviated DET) is a word which adds information to a noun. It gives information about the context of the noun. A determiner may show whether the thing described is definite or indefinite, closer or more distant, singular or plural, etc. 

Common kinds of determiners include definite and indefinite articles (like the English "the" and "a" or "an"), demonstratives ("this" and "that"), possessives ("my" and "their"), quantifiers ("many", "few" and "several"), numerals ("three, twenty"), this may mean it tells you how many of something there is.

Grammatical number

Grammatical number is the way numbers and counting are fitted into sentences.

Most languages have ways to express differences of number. 

Common categories of grammatical number are singular (one) or plural (not one). Some languages, also have a notion of dual, for two, or of paucal, for "a few".

Some languages (like Chinese) do not have the concept of grammatical number, and numbers or other quantifiers are used if necessary. Finally, there may be words that have only one form or are not countable.

Vaginal tumors

Vaginal tumors are tumors that can be found in the vagina. A tumor in the vagina can be cancer (malignant) but not all tumors in the vagina are cancer. Tumors that are not cancer are called benign tumors. Tumors have many different names. Another name for a tumor is neoplasm. A neoplasm is too much growth of tissue that forms a lump.
If cancer is found in the vagina it most often has spread there from other places in the body. Cancer found in the vagina may have come from the bladder, stomach and intestines. 

A tumor in the vagina can be solid or filled with fluid (or both).

Vaginal cancer is rare. It is an overgrowth of tissue in the vagina. Some benign tumors may turn into cancer.

A vaginal tumor can cause bleeding, pain with sex and feelings of pressure. A tumor in the vagina is often found during a check up and pelvic exam. Doctors may order more tests like an ultrasound, CAT scan and MRI. Doctors will look at a piece of the tumor under a microscope to see what kind of tumor that it is.





Vaginal tumors also can be found in some animals:

Eluanbi Lighthouse

Eluanbi Lighthouse was built in 1883. It was built by the Qing Dynasty. It was built because a lot of accidents happened in this area. Ships crashed into the reefs in the waters nearby. The Qing Dynasty wanted to prevent accidents like the Rover Incident. W. F. Spindey, who was an English architect that was part of the Royal Geographical Society was hired to build this lighthouse. The lighthouse is the only one in Taiwan that is armed. It has a trench around it and a lot of gun holes in the wall. This was needed because many of the local Aboriginal people raided the lighthouse a lot.

After the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Taiwan became a part of the Empire of Japan. Damage on the lighthouse from the First Sino-Japanese War was fixed in 1898 by the Japanese. In World War II, the lighthouse became damaged again during the Aerial Battle of Taiwan-Okinawa.

Insertion sort

In computer science, insertion sort is a method of sorting data, such as numbers, one item at a time. It is not a very efficient method compared to other algorithms such as quicksort. However, it is a very simple algorithm that is easy to build.

Think about the sequence of numbers in the picture below. It starts with a small number (written as ≤x), then a big number (≥x) and then a medium sized number (written as x). If this had specific numbers, it might start with 2 (small), 10 (big), 4 (medium). The number 10 is bigger than the number 4. So if the sequence were in order from smallest to biggest, it should start with 2, 4, 10. So the second and third numbers should be swapped. So, in the example below, the sequence should start with ≤x, x, ≥x. 

When the sequence it sorted, the medium number is moved in between the small (≤x) and big (≥x) numbers. So the sequence becomes:

Brazilian Space Agency

The Brazilian Space Agency (; AEB) is the Brazilian agency for the country's growing space program. It runs a spaceport at Alcântara and a launch pad at Barreira do Inferno. The Brazilian Space Agency made Brazil a part of the International Space Station mission.

The Brazil Space Program was created in 1961 and was controlled by the Brazilian military. Since the military controlled the program, research there was not much research. Some technological research was not allowed because other countries were worried about developing ICBMs with nuclear bombs.

Brazil launched it's first Brazilian made satellite on February 9, 1993. The satellite was used to study space.

On February 10, 1994, the Brazilian military stopped running the Space Program, which then became the Brazilian Space Agency.

In 2003, a rocket exploded and killed 21 people. Brazil was able to successfully launch its first rocket into space on October 23, 2004. Several other successful launches have followed.

On March 30, 2006, Brazilian astronaut Marcos Pontes became the first Brazilian and the first native Portuguese-speaking person to go to space. He stayed on the International Space Station for a week. He landed in Kazakhstan on April 8, 2006 with the astronauts on Expedition 12.

The Alcântara Launch Center (; CLA) is the main launch site and home to the Brazilian Space Agency. It is in the state of Maranhão. This place is good because not many people live there and it is easy to protect. It also gives good access to the sky and sea. Since it is close to the equator, it makes launching a special type of satellite that stays over one part of the earth much easier.

The Barreira do Inferno Launch Center (; CLBI) is another launch site of the Brazilian Space Agency. It is in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. It is mostly used to launch a special type of rocket for research. It also helps the Alcântara Launch Center.

Acre foot

An acre-foot is a unit of volume used in the United States to measure large amounts of water resources. It makes measuring water in reservoirs, lakes, and rivers.

An acre-foot is the amount of water it would take to cover an acre of land with water deep. One acre-foot of water is the same as of water. It is about the same amount of water as a 8-lane, 25 m long competition swimming pool.

The typical American family uses about 1 acre-foot of water in a year or about per day. In some places in the deserts of the Southwestern United States, water conservation is a rule. In these areas, a normal family only uses 0.25 acre-feet of water per year.

Large amounts of water can also be in thousands of acre-feet or TAF.

Messier 32

Messier 32 (also known as NGC 221) is a dwarf "early-type" galaxy about 2.65 million light-years from Earth. It is seen in the constellation Andromeda.

M32 is a satellite galaxy of the large Andromeda Galaxy (M31). It was discovered by Guillaume Le Gentil in 1749. M32 measures 6.5 ± 0.2 thousand light-years in diameter at the widest point.

The galaxy is a compact elliptical galaxy type. Compact ellipticals are rather rare.
Half the stars are inside an effective radius of only 100 parsecs.

Densities in the central area increase steeply, over 3×10 M pc as seen by the HST. The half-light radius of this central star cluster is around 6 parsec. In other words, this small centre of the galaxy emits half the light of the central 100 parsecs.

Like more ordinary elliptical galaxies, M32 contains mostly older faint red and yellow stars with practically no dust or gas and consequently no current star formation. It does, however, show hints of star formation in the relatively recent past.
M32 contains a supermassive black hole.
Its mass is between 1.5 and 5 million solar masses.

Barnard's galaxy

Barnard's galaxy (also known as NGC 6822, IC 4895, or Caldwell 57) is an irregular barred spiral galaxy. It is about 1.6 million light-years away, in the constellation Sagittarius. 
The galaxy is part of the Local Group of galaxies. It was discovered by E.E. Barnard in 1884 with a six-inch refractor telescope. 

The galaxy is one of the closest to the Milky Way. It is similar in structure and makeup to the Small Magellanic Cloud. It is about 7,000 light-years in diameter.

The galaxy is famous because it is where cepheid variables were used to find out how far away the galaxy was. Edwin Hubble found 11 cepheid variable stars, and used them to find the distance to the galaxy. This settled a great debate in the 1920s about the scale of the universe and the nature of spiral galaxies. It became clear that all "spiral nebulae" were in fact spiral "galaxies". They are far outside our own Milky Way.

Cheerleader effect

The Cheerleader effect, or group attractiveness effect is a kind of cognitive bias: People who are part of a group are seen as more attractive, than those who aren't. This observation is valid for both men and women. The effect was coined by Barney Stinson (played by Neil Patrick Harris) in American sitcom How I Met Your Mother. It was first academically described in a study done 2013, and the result is backed up by another in 2015.

Showing the effect may be difficult: The study done in 2015 was repeated, but did not show the same result. According to the research team, this may be due to cultural differences, since the new study was performed in Japan.

Open set

In set theory an open set is a set where all elements have the same properties. Simply put, an open set is a set that does not include its edges or endpoints. For each point in the set, you can make a bubble around that point, such that all points in the bubble are also in the set.

On the other hand, a closed set includes all its edges or endpoints. A set that includes some of its edges or endpoints is neither open nor closed. 

An open set is very similar to an open interval.

The set (0,1) is open. If we choose a very small value, there will always be a small bubble which are all in the set (0,1).

If we choose a very small value h ∈ (0,1), we can make a bubble formula_1, in which all the values are in (0,1).
However, [0,1] is closed. If we choose the value 0, and choose a very small value k, 0-k ∉ [0,1], which means that it's closed.

The building was bought by RBS in 2004 along with 5 Canada Square (leased to Bank of America) for $1.12 billion. Subsequently, on 2 July 2007, CGC2 was individually sold to a joint venture between Quinlan Private and PropInvest for £1 billion (US$2 billion). Citigroup pay £46.5 million a year in rent for the tower, generating a yield of 4.6% to the owners. The east-facing side of 25 Canada Square up to level 40 is configured for use by tenants.

33 Canada Square, or Citigroup Centre 1, is the smaller of the two buildings in the complex, designed by Norman Foster and completed in 1999, two years before its neighbour. At tall, the building is made up of eighteen floors, all of which are adjoined to their equivalent floors in 25 Canada Square.

Andaman Islands

The Andaman Islands are an archipelago and form a part of the Indian union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

There are 572 islands, about 36 of which are inhabited. Andaman islands is a prime location for tourism.

The economy of Andaman is based on fishing and agriculture. Andaman also has other natural resources. Handicrafts, timber, wildlife and the tourism are important.

Being an island region, the major part of Andaman’s economy is fishing industry. Varieties used include Ocellaris Clownfish, mackerels, barracuda, mullets, tuna, sardines and flying fishes, and seashells.

Agriculture and food production changed in recent times, with the government bringing in special provisions to increase productivity on the limited land available. The crops grown here are seasonal vegetables, oilseeds, pulses, pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, red oil, rubber, palm and cashew nuts.

Tourism brings lot of activity to the Andamans. Andaman is seen as a destination for honeymooners, with the next image being a tropical island with a variety of water sports available here. Also, travel has promoted other great industries in the area as well, like the banking sector, wildlife regions, handicrafts, shipping etc.
About 200,000 visitors came to enjoy the beaches and tropical climate in 2010. Havelock Island and Jolly Buoy are two places famous for their pristine patches of coral, making these one of the best dive spots in the region. Havelock Island is considered a heaven for beach lovers. The Radhanagar beach on Havelock was ranked as Asia’s best by the TimeTM, and was placed amongst the top seven beaches of the world as well.


The total population of Andaman, as per the census of 2011, was 356,152. Of the total population 53.25% were male, and 46.75% were the female. Major languages spoken here are Hindi, Nicobarese, Bengali, Tamil, Malayalam and Telugu. The variety of languages may have been caused by the establishment of a penal colony here during british rule. The British brought in slaves and forced labourers, as well as prisoners here. These people stayed to make this place their home, resulting in such a divere population.

The aboriginal Andamanese people are a small minority of the population, less than 1000 people. Out of the original ten tribes who inhabited the islands, only about four are still in existence. These are:

Jan Mayensfield

Jan Mayensfield () is an aerodrome or airfield in Jan Mayen, Norway. It is run by the Norwegian Armed Forces. The aerodrome serves both the civilians and the military on the island. The airfield was opened in 1960. The runway is made of dirt and is long. The runway is labeled 06-24.

Eight times a year, a Lockheed C-130 Hercules from the 335 Squadron from Bodø Main Air Station brings supplies and new people. Landing safely can be difficult because the volcano nearby called Beerenberg causes wind vortexes.

The airfield was made by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Norwegian Armed Forces. They started to work on the airfield in 1958. To make the work easier, the workers made the runway from a existing dirt road. The first airplane to land at the airfield was a Consolidated PBY Catalina on September 17, 1960.

The first non-military aircraft to land at the airfield was a Douglas DC-4 which brought journalists on October 29, 1961. Grumman HU-16 Albatrosses and the Douglas DC-6s have also landed at the airfield. The airfield was named after movie star Jayne Mansfield as a joke, but the name stuck.

In 1970, the volcano called Beerenberg erupted and all the people were evacuated. A C-130 was sent to the island to get the people and was able to land on the dirt runway. More and more supplies were delivered by aircraft after that. Most supplies were delivered by ship.

The C-130 from the Royal Norwegian Air Force visits the island only eight times a year. The runway is not open for regular commercial use. The runway can be used for research and search and rescue.

The dirt runway is . One end of the runway points to 060 degrees on a compass and the other end points to 240 degrees.

The Jan Mayensfield airdrome's weather can change a lot. It is often foggy. Kármán vortexes can make the winds quickly change direction.

IN 1991, a C-130 aircraft almost crashed after take off due to the wind shifting.

A World War II plane crashed near where the airfield was built.

Bose gas

Bose gas is a concept in quantum mechanics.

Classical mechanics has a concept called ideal gas. This concept describes how a gas usually behaves, in different settings. A bose gas is the analogous concept in quantum mechanics. 

A bose gas is made of bosons with a positive spin value. These bosons also follow the Bose-Einstein statistics. The statistical mechanics of bosons were developed by Satyendra Nath Bose for photons. Albert Einstein extended the theory, when he realized that an ideal gas of bosons would form a condensate at a low enough temperature. This condensate is known as a Bose–Einstein condensate. This is not the case with a classical ideal gas.

Zou people

Zou Tribe is one of the Schedule Tribes of Manipur. The Zou tribal populace is mainly concentrated in two districts of the state, namely, Churachandpur and Chandel. Zou language has been incorporated in the study curriculum of several high schools and also some of the higher secondary schools in the state of Manipur.
Zou tribes are a less known indigenous community residing along the Indo-Burma border. Zou tribe is officially recognised as Indian Scheduled Tribe in the state of Manipur. Zou tribal population in the country is estimated to be nearly 20,000 to 25,000, although there are no official records. Zou tribal community is mostly concentrated in and around Churachandpur district and Chandel district of this state of North-East India. According to 2001 census report, the Zou population has been ranked as the 10th largest amongst the Scheduled Tribe population in Manipur. Zou language is one of the set Major Indian Languages taught in the high schools and higher secondary schools of the state.

In India, the Zou are officially recognized as one of the thirty-three indigenous peoples within the state of Manipur, and are one of the scheduled tribes. According to the 2001 Census, the Zou population in Manipur is around 20,000, less than 3% of the population. The community is concentrated in Churachandpur and Chandel districts of Manipur in North-East India.

The history of Zou tribe is not very clear. The Zou tribes have Indo-Chinese origin and the in the local dialect of the Zou people, the name of the tribal group suggests 'human being'. There is a saying among the tribal community that mankind is born from trees, leaves and soil. It is believed that the early history of Zou community is lost in legends and myths. The linguistic and racial evidences imply that they are of Indo-Chinese origin. Linguists said that the Zomi language belongs to Tibeto-Burman language family. In the South-East Asian region, there had been some dynasties, places and people, which bear the mark, Zou with some variations in spelling. Further, some scholars also suggest that around 200 BC because of regular Chinese attacks, the Zomis probably have moved to the north east of Tibet.

The Zou tribal community has a script of its own, which is known as "Zolai". All the write ups of the Zou tribes are being done using the script. Today, this Zolai script has gained popularity amongst Zou youths who have started to learn the script with lots of enthusiasm and excitement. However, Roman script is the official script that has been used by the Zou population. Even the holy book Bible has been translated in to Zou language making use of Roman script. In Manipur, the literacy rate of the Zou tribes is low and it is around 61.6 percent according to 2001 Census report. It is to be noted that the Zou dialectal group is just a branch of the huge traditional group, namely, Chin-Kuki-Lushai ethnic group.

Original Mother Tongue of Zote (Zomi)

Round about 1450 A.D, Pu Hanghil (the father of Chie Manlun) and Pu Gen Kun of Taithul family founded Hai Daw village from Suih Mual village. Pu Gen Kun was appointed to be the Headman of Hai Dawi village. Both of them fought together against Bum Zang village which was about two miles from Hai Dawi. There they defeated the villagers of Bum Zang village. Later, Pu Hang Hil was appointed as Headman of Bum Zang village. Later, Pu Hang Hil shifted to Khua Dai village which is about three miles from Bum Zang village. There his sons Man Lun, Ma Tuang, Mang Son, Hang Vung and Mat Mang were born. As they grew in about 1500 A.D Manlun started his ruling as a chief Khuangnung in village. Mantuang in 1550 A.D at Phaitu village, Mangson at Gamngai and Hangvung at Khuadai village(?). So, we can simply point out that the first Zote Khua was Hai Dawi village. Up to this day Hai Dawi people still exist a people and they speak Hai Dawi dialect. To the original tongue of Zote might be Hai Dawi dialect.

As the Israelites retained the Hebrew language so also if we are going to retain our real mother tongue, we must speak Hai Dawi dialect, for it was the first and lingua franca of Zote descendants. Similarly if any one among Zote descendants would like to print any book or Bible, he would use the Hai Dawi dialect words, not because of its fitness, but only for its originality. I believe we all agree to give first priority to Hai Dawi dialect as our Zote-original mother tongue.

The Hai Dawi dialect

Maw na sung ma naw in, amaw sa pi ma in leimi in i piang a, a khawh ma ma - gam lua a i lua suhsuh ih mawnate ma ei bawl in eima pumpi ei man muda maithei, Ih mawnate -eeng taang gol lua a hi man in khat veivei eima mawnate eimon maisah zolo maithei va-ia kim lai, tuate lip khap sih saang a pamai eisa, ei khua tua ngeet-nguut ngeng ngong man a ih dial dual liang luang mawna nei van nuai ei mai sah thop valong, abieh huai tapo ma Jehova ki chi Pasian khat a na om ngang tangh hi.

Translation: 
As we are born in sin, we cannot even love ourselves and there is no knowledge about what is forgiveness, because of the enormous sins inherited in us. Eventhough we are in this situation, inspite of our enormous sins the one who has mercy, sympathises us and forgives us our sins is the God called Jehovah.
Tua Jehovah Pasian in atapa neisun Zeisu tawh ei maw nei leimite ei tat ngam giap na, itna sang a a uang gol zaw lim itna dang leitung ah tu dong kimu nai va-ia lo hi.

Transaltion:
Jehovah God's love in giving his only begotten son for the remission of our sins and its horrible consequence is the greatest love in the world. There is greater love in the world up to this day.

These Zou tribes, following the trend of the other tribes, too follow Christianity as their main religion. This Zou community has a plethora of rituals and customs, both religious as well as social, undergo sea change to keep up with the trend of present day modern trends. The Zou people follow ceremonies associated with nature. The Zou tribal society still loyally maintains their old patriarchal structure.

Hunting and agriculture are the major occupation of the Zou tribal people. Modern education system empowered the Zou women to enter today's job market.

The traditional customs, practices and other related issues of this small tribe has recently been explored systematically. Unfortunately, this tribe has escaped the attention of social scientists in general and sociologists in particular. The Zous like other tribal communities in the northeast India have maintained their age-old customary practices.

The Zou tribe generally follows what is called as "Patrilineal cross-cousin's marriage" which is their first choice known as Neita. It is generally observed that the traditional marriage system of the Zou tribes is regulated either by (i) Tong Mou (Arranged marriage), (ii) Neita (Cross cousin Marriage), and (ii) Elopement Marriage. THe above three types of marriage of course consist of arrange as well as love marriage. There are minute details to be explored with related to Zou customary marriage practices, I am not going to elaborate on all these minute details at the moment. This article aims at the contemporary practices without going in deep studies.

Once there were two woman who were great friends and they loved each other very much. One day they made an agreement that if one gives birth to a male baby and other give birth to a female baby they would marry them to each other. Later in the use two pregnant women gave birth to a female and the other woman gave birth to a male baby.The male baby was named Ngambawm and the female baby was named Khupching. Khupching belongs to a royal family whereas Ngambawm belong to a poor family. So their social disparities created a social barrier. Khupching’s parents retracted from their agreement to marry these two people.So they tried to seeparate them rightr from their babyhood. They used different cradles,but it was so amazing that the two babies join themselves in one cradle. Even in the field they thought that they had separated while ploughing the field they found the two babies join together in the evening in one cradle.As they grew up Khupching and Ngambawm loved each other very much. One day Ngambawm asked Khupching to marry him. 
But Khupching replied in songs:

(a) Ka tun va dongin,ka zuo va dong in khuokhâl tui bang hing la ve aw.

[ask my mother ask my father fetch me like the dry season(autumn) waters.] 
Ngambawm asked her parents.They refused/rejected him flatly.

Ngambawm sang this song:
"(a) Na tun lah dong ing na zuo lah dong ing khuokhâl tui bang lâh nâilou e."
I had asked your mother and father, they flatly refused to marry you to me, but I can not fetch you like dry season (autumn) waters. On hearing her parents refused him, her love for Ngambawm increased day by day.

One day Ngambawm plucked a single hair of Khupching and he placed it under a stone which was near a waterfall of a stream.Khupching fell ill since then.Her mother decalred that if someone could cure her he will be her husand. When he heard this news ngambawm took back the hair from under the stone and put it back into Khupching’s head. Ngambawm cured her but her parents still refused him marriage to her. Ngambawm again took back and he put it under the stone nearby stream once again. She became ill bagain. Her parents again promised the same as before to one who could cure her. He took the hair and put it back into her head and she was cured. In this way he cured her many times.But her parents were adamanat not to mary her off to him. Ngambawm again hid her hair under a stone unfortunately this time her hair was lost in the running stream. So Khupching fell ill and died. When the body was about to be buried her body swelled like a big balloon and the people could not extricate out of the house. The people were flabber-gasted and amazed about this phenomenon. No one could solve the problem. So they requested Ngambawm to come and help them out. Ngambawm spoke to the corpse saying “Darling we are separated but this is the will of God, make your self small again and get out of the the door”. After that the corpse became small and was able to get out the door easily. Once again the corpse refused to get out of the entrance of the gate of the house by swelling big. again. Ngambawm said “Darling, make yourself small again one more and get out of the entrance gate of the house.” After that the corpse was easily taken out of the entrance gate.After Khupching was buried Ngambawm returned to his house filled with tears.

"(a) Atui in hal e, têu a tui in hal ,hal jou nailou zawlching ngâi ing e. "
(b) Atui suh inlu ong damdiel in luong e, Ching aw vâi bang na thâm na hie?
[The waterfall was between us but it could not separate us I love Chingkhup more and more. The water flows gently but you died in this flowing water.]

One day Ngambawm planted a cockscomb flower on the tomb of Khupching. He saw a wild cat coming to pluck the flowers and he caught it by chance.When he asked the wild cat as to why it plucked the flowers every night it told him that it was sent by Khupching. Ngambawm then requested the wildcat to take him to Khupching but the wildcat replied that he (Ngambawm) will not be able to reach the village (it was the land or village of the dead) as the path was dangerous and treacherous. But Ngambawm still followed the wildcat through the harsh path and he finally arrived at the village where Khupching lives. On seeing her his joy knew no bounds. He and Khupching lived together in the house. One day the villagers went for fishing expedition She sent him also to join the villagers and she gave him the bamboo basket for collecting fishes.

One day Khupching said to Ngambawm, “ Please go back to your village,as soon as you reach your home kill one pig and eat its meat. After that hang a spear above your bed, and let free all the chicken from their roosts. Then, lie down on your bed facing the roof of your house whre you hanged the spear”. As advised by her he returned to his village soon and he did whatever things to be done as told by Khupching.As he lay on his bed the spear was made to fall on his chest by Khupching spirit's and he was killed instantly. After his death his spirit went the village of Khupching. He reached her house and they both met each other happily ever after.

Cordaitales

Cordaitales are an extinct order of woody plants. They are gymnosperms which may have been early conifers. 

They had cone-like reproductive structures rather like those of modern conifers. The Cordaitales appeared during the Carboniferous period. They made big trees which were common on drier ground in tropical environments. 

Also, some tall trees and some shrubby mangrove-like species of Cordaitales seem to have grown in the Carboniferous coal swamps. Cordaitales were also abundant during the Permian, but died out at the end of the Permian. 

Many Cordiatales had elongated strap-like leaves, which look like the leaves of some modern-day conifers of the Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae. 

Podocarpaceae

Podocarpaceae is a large family of mainly Southern Hemisphere conifers. There are about 156 species of evergreen trees and shrubs. It has up to 19 genera. The distribution of this family suggests its early evolution took place in the ancient southern continent of Gondwana.

The family is a member of the Antarctic flora. Its main centres of diversity are in Australasia, particularly New Caledonia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. They are also in Malesia and South America (mainly in the Andes mountains).

Several genera extend north of the equator into Indochina and the Philippines. "Podocarpus" goes as far north as southern Japan and southern China in Asia, and Mexico in the Americas, and "Nageia" into southern China and southern India. Two genera also occur in sub-Saharan Africa, the widespread "Podocarpus" and the endemic "Afrocarpus".

"Parasitaxus usta" is unique as the only known parasitic gymnosperm. It occurs on New Caledonia, where it is parasitic on another member of the Podocarpaceae, "Falcatifolium taxoides".

United States Space Force

The United States Space Force (USSF) is a part of the U.S. Armed Forces. It is focused on war in space. It is the sixth branch of the U.S. military.
It is a part of the Department of the Air Force, one of the three parts of the Department of Defense. Because of this, the Space Force is led by the Secretary of the Air Force, who is under the Secretary of Defense. The leader of the Space Force is called the Chief of Space Operations. 

On June 18, 2018, President Donald Trump announced in an address to the National Space Council a directive that requests the creation of a sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces.

The president announced his intention for The Pentagon to create the 'Space Force' as an independent service branch, separate from the United States Air Force. Many US Senators stated they would rather create a Space Corps inside the Air Force. The Air Force has had a "Space Command" since September 1, 1982. 

Vice President Mike Pence in August 2018 announced a plan that would create the Space Force by 2020.

General John W. Raymond was nominated to be commander of Space Command in April 2019, and his nomination was heard in the United States Senate in June 2019. He was previously head of U.S. Air Force Space Command. Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett approved the moving of part of the Air Force to the Space Force and making it the Space Operations Command. 

On 20 December 2019, the Space Force became the sixth armed service branch. General Raymond became the first Chief of Space Operations. This happened on 20 December 2019.

The United States Space Force Act says that it will exist to make sure that the United States can operate freely in space. It ensures that they can conduct military actions in space quickly and for a long time. 

Its duties are to protect the interests of the United States in space. It also prevents attacks on the United States in and from space, and to generally operate in space.

The Space Force is one of two equal parts of the Department of the Air Force. The other one is the United States Air Force. Both are run by the Secretary of the Air Force.

The leader of the Space Force is the Chief of Space Operations (CSO), who is a general. The Chief of Space Operations became a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in December 2020,one year after the Space Force Act was passed. 

About 16,000 Air Force members were intended to become part of the Space Force while the branch became part of the U.S. Armed Forces. It is making its own way of training members, and will create uniforms, ranks, logo, patch, awards, and an official song. This was supposed to happen within 18 months after the Space Force became independent.

A few months before she was born, her mother was in a shipwreck. Many people died, but her mother was saved by the king's brother.

Western lowland gorilla

The western lowland gorilla ("Gorilla gorilla gorilla") is one of two subspecies of the western gorilla ("Gorilla gorilla") that lives in rain forests in Central Africa in Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon.

Western lowland gorillas are intelligent, and understand simple sign language. Koko was a famous western lowland gorilla who communicated in sign language.

The western lowland gorilla is the only subspecies kept in zoos, except for one female Eastern lowland gorilla named Amahoro who lives at the Antwerp Zoo and a few Mountain gorillas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Western gorilla

The western gorilla ("Gorilla gorilla") is a great ape, closely related to chimpanzees, orangutans and humans. They are the type species as well as the most populous species of the genus "Gorilla". Nearly all of the individuals of this taxon belong to the western lowland gorilla subspecies. The other subspecies are the Cross River gorilla.

Western lowland gorillas are generally lighter colored than eastern gorillas. Western lowland gorillas have black, dark grey or dark brown-grey hair with a brownish forehead. Measurements of wild individuals show that mature males average in height.

Cross River gorilla

The Cross River gorilla ("Gorilla gorilla diehli") is a subspecies of the western gorilla ("Gorilla gorilla").

The Cross River gorilla was first described as a new species of Western gorilla by Paul Matschie, a mammalian taxonomist, in 1904.

According a study published by the American Museum of Natural History, the Cross River gorilla has been described as having smaller dentitions, smaller palates, smaller cranial vaults, and shorter skulls than other western gorillas.

Illegal hunting of these gorillas are the reason why they may go extinct.

Eastern lowland gorilla

The eastern lowland gorilla or Grauer's gorilla ("Gorilla beringei graueri") is a subspecies of eastern gorilla. It is native to the mountainous forests of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. 

It is the largest of the four gorilla subspecies. It has jet black coats like the mountain gorilla ("Gorilla beringei beringei"), although the hair is shorter on the head and body. The male's coat, like that of other gorillas, greys as the animal matures, resulting in the designation "silverback".

Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington (28 December 1882 – 22 November 1944) was an important English scientist. He was an astronomer, physicist, and mathematician in the early 20th century.

Eddington did his greatest work in astrophysics. He was also a philosopher of science and a populariser of science. The Eddington limit is named after him. It is the natural limit to the luminosity of stars, or the radiation generated by accretion onto a compact object (which is what causes the luminosity). 

Around 1920, he anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion in stars. This was published in his paper "The Internal Constitution of the Stars". At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington was the first to correctly speculate that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium.

He is also famous for his work on the theory of relativity. Eddington wrote a number of articles that explained Einstein's theory of general relativity to the English-speaking world. World War I severed many lines of scientific communication and new developments in German science were not well known in England. He also conducted an expedition to observe the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919. That gave one of the earliest confirmations of general relativity.The observations showed that light from stars which passed close by the Sun was slightly bent towards the Sun. This was predicted by the general theory of relativity. He became known for his popular expositions and interpretations of the theory.

FOXP2

FOXP2 is a gene which codes for a protein needed for speech and language.

It codes for "Forkhead box protein P2", which is needed for the proper development of speech and language in humans. Versions of this gene occur in many vertebrates, where it generally plays a role in communication (for instance, the development of bird song).

"FOXP2" is the first gene found which affects speech and language. The gene is more active in females than in males. In humans, mutations of "FOXP2" cause a severe speech and language disorder. 

"FOXP2" is popularly dubbed the "language gene", but this is only partly correct since there are other genes involved in language development. It directly regulates a number of other genes, including "CNTNAP2", "CTBP1", and "SRPX2".

Two amino acid substitutions distinguish the human "FOXP2" protein from that found in chimpanzees. Evidence suggests that these changes affect the functions of "FOXP2".

Innamaadhoo (Raa Atoll)

Innamaadhoo (Dhivehi: އިއްނަމާދޫ) <br>
This island is an inhabited island in Raa atoll. Like other islands, this island is made out of sand from corals. 

The inhabitants are Maldivians and they speak their language, Dhivehi. 

The economy of Innamaadhoo is built on carpentry. So, when you look at the whole country, the most carpenting experts are mostly from Innamaadhoo. From very small fishing boats to giant safari boats are built in this island. Even if wheat was grown few decades back, farming is not a very wide field. If we look at fishing, the islanders used to fish a lot in the 90's. So, putting salt on fish was a very wide field. But now, as the field perished, fishermen and fish-sellers are very less. The reason is believed to be because carpentry gives a lot of money (carpentry is a very good money-maker). In the field of tourism, inhabitants aren't directly contributing. It may be because there is no resort nearby. But diving boats, row boats, and ferries, etc. (needed for resorts) are built a lot here.

Basic income

A universal basic income (UBI) or simply basic income is a social program in which all citizens of a population regularly receive a sum of money from the government. A pure or unconditional basic income has no means test, much like Social Security in the United States. Basic income can be implemented nationally, regionally or locally. The idea gained attention in recent years because people fear that technology will make many jobs obsolete in the future.

The idea has never been put in place by any country yet, but there have been some experimental trials.

In a 2016 survey, 64% of Europeans voted for an UBI.

An UBI is an income for everyone. There would be neither a social administrative means test nor a requirement of willingness to work. On the other hand, tax- and contribution-financed social benefits like unemployment benefit, social assistance or child benefit would no longer apply.

The incomes would be:


The Roman emperor Trajan gave 650 denarii to all common Roman citizens who applied.

In the 1516 book "Utopia", Sir Thomas More describes a society in which every person receives a guaranteed income.

In 1984, the Basic Income Research Group began researching on basic income.

In the 21st century, the idea gained attention because many people fear that artificial intelligence (AI) and automation will make many jobs obsolete in the near future.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a petition in Europe called for an "emergency basic income". It got more than 200,000 signatures. The public opinion was largely positive.

One of the most popular reasons for an UBI is that artificial intelligence (AI) and automation will make many jobs obsolete in the near future. However, people still have to get enough money to live, even when there is no work for them anymore. An UBI could be a good solution for this problem.

Advocates of UBI say that with basic income, unattractive jobs would have to be better paid and their working conditions improved. This is because there is still a need for people who do this kind of work. And if they already get enough money from UBI, there has to be an incentive for doing these jobs.

Some hope that an UBI will lead to a happier and fairer society with fewer debates about envy.

Some people also think that an UBI could make society more creative because people would no longer have the pressure to work. For example, people would have more time to educate themselves or find things they are interested in.

Some believe that an UBI will increase the willingness to take risks because everyone would be financially secure to some degree. This would promote a culture of ingenuity and increase the spirit of invention.

There are many prominent advocates of universal basic income. The English-language Wikipedia has a whole article about UBI advocates. This section here only lists the most notable advocates.

Since the 1960s, there have been a number of basic income pilot programs and experiments. Some examples include:

Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency is a type of currency which uses digital files as money. Often, people create these files using the same ways as cryptography (the science of hiding information). Cryptocurrency users can use Digital signatures to keep the transactions safe, and to let other people check that the transactions are real. The creators of the first cryptocurrencies made them to be free of government-given currencies.

No single person controls cryptocurrencies. Instead they are decentralized and controlled by many people. This is different from 'centralized' electronic money and central banks, which a small group of people control. The control of each cryptocurrency works through a distributed ledger (a list of transactions shared by everyone), usually a blockchain. This lets everyone know all of the financial transactions that happen.

Bitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is famous because it was the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Since then, people have created more than 4,000 cryptocurrencies (sometimes called altcoins, or "alternative coins"). 

In many cases, it is not possible to exchange cryptocurrencies for real currencies such as the US dollar. It is only possible to convert them to other cryptocurrencies. People can also use them to buy things. But some cryptocurrencies can be converted to real currencies. Those cryptocurrencies usually have high volatility, (their price changes very often). Using them is very risky. They are also a target for Pump-and-Dump-Attacks. They act like a big distributed economic system: because they are not issued or controlled by central banks, their value is difficult to influence. For this reason, they cannot really take the place of a stable currency.

People often use cryptocurrencies to do speculation. That makes building a system of more or less stable exchange rates very difficult. Another problem is the inequality of distribution. A small number of people have most of the cryptocurrency. About 1.000 people hold half of the total amount of bitcoins in the world. So if any of these people start using the Bitcoin that they own, they will change the exchange rate. It also means that these people have a great influence on the value of the currency. They can change its value easily. The currency itself only tells you who owns it. Exchange rates of cryptocurrencies are established outside the system. Traders and brokers set the exchange rate. This is not a guarantee that they trade cryptocurrency at the value that they suggest. The unit of cryptocurrency doesn't have value by itself. 

In contrast to cryptocurrencies, central banks control "real" currencies such as the US dollar, Japanese yen, euro, or Chinese renminbi. Certain economic phenomena such as inflation or deflation may change the value (and exchange rate) of a currency. The people who own units of the currency have no direct influence on its value. 

According to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions:


In March 2018, the word ""cryptocurrency"" was added to the "Merriam-Webster Dictionary".

Cryptocurrency mixing is a service where tainted bitcoins can become unmarked bitcoins. Bitcoin mixing, also called Bitcoin tumbling or Bitcoin blending, is the process of using a service to make your Bitcoin purchases and transactions untraceable. Instantly mixing Bitcoin is the only way to hide bitcoin exchanges and make them impossible to track. This protects against criminals, hackers, and activities prohibited by the law where people use bitcoin. It also protects against law enforcement. The huge amount of bitcoins on mixing services come from mining pools around the world.

Crypto mining is the process of using specialized hardware and software to verify transactions on a blockchain network. The process involves solving complex mathematical equations to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. Miners are rewarded for their efforts with cryptocurrency, usually in the form of the coin that they are mining. There are three main types of crypto mining: Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Authority (PoA)

Proof of Work is the most widely used consensus mechanism in the crypto space. It is used by Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies. In PoW, miners have to solve complex mathematical equations to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. The miner who solves the equation first is rewarded with cryptocurrency.

Proof of Stake is a newer consensus mechanism that is becoming increasingly popular. In PoS, instead of solving complex equations, miners are chosen to validate transactions based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold. This is known as ‘staking’. The more cryptocurrency a miner holds, the more likely they are to be chosen to validate transactions.

Proof of Authority (PoA) is a consensus algorithm for private or consortium chains. It uses a set of trusted nodes, or validators, to secure the network. These nodes are pre-selected by the network administrator and are responsible for validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain.

Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway

The Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway (DNSR) was a cross-country railway running north–south between Didcot, Newbury and Winchester in England. 

The line opened in stages between 1882 and 1885. Owing to lack of money, it never reached Southampton, so trains from Winchester to Southampton went by another route.

The line closed between 1960 and 1962 and some sections have become cycle routes. There are plans to build a cafe, the "Handlebar Cafe", on the cycle route near Winchester.

Sasha Obama

Duodecimal

The duodecimal system (also known as base 12 or dozenal) is the number system with a base of twelve. In the duodecimal system, large numbers are expressed by groups of 12. For example, the number fifty (which we usually write as 50) would be written as 42 in the dozenal system, since it is equal to 4×12+2.

The number 12 is the smallest number that has four factors (2, 3, 4, 6). If one divides the numbers 10 and 12 with 3, the results will be 3.333... and 4, respectively. Doing the same thing with 6, the results will be 1.666... and 2. So, the duodecimal system can control the fractions better than the decimal system.

There are no numerical symbols that represent 10 and 11 in duodecimal, so letters taken from the English alphabet are used, specifically X (from the Roman numeral for ten) and E (from the initial of eleven). Some people use A and B (as ann and bet) as well.

Edna Kramer in her 1951 book "The Main Stream of Mathematics" used * and # for 10 and 11. The symbols were chosen because they are available in typewriters and push-button telephones.

This article uses ↊ (dec) and ↋ (elf) for 10 and 11.

Volatility

In economics, the term volatility is used to measure how much the price or value of an economic good or service changes over time. Goods or services where the price changes a lot are said to have a "high volatility", those that don't have a "low volatility". The word come from the Latin verb "volare" meaning "to fly".

In the securities markets, volatility is often associated with big swings in either direction. For example, when the stock market rises and falls more than one percent over a sustained period of time, it is called a "volatile" market. An asset's volatility is a key factor when pricing options contracts. In statistical terms, volatility is the standard deviation of a market or security’s annualised returns over a given period - essentially the rate at which its price increases or decreases. Historical volatility is calculated using a series of past market prices, while implied volatility looks at expected future volatility, using the market price of a market-traded derivative like an option.

Market volatility is caused by a host of several factors

R. Scott Bakker

Richard Scott Bakker (born February 2, 1967, Simcoe, Ontario) is a Canadian fantasy author. He also lectures in the South Western Ontario university community. He grew up on a tobacco farm in the Simcoe area. In 1986 he attended the University of Western Ontario and studied literature. He later completed an MA in theory and criticism. After further study in philosophy at Vanderbilt University he returned to London, Ontario where he now lives with his wife and daughter. He spends his time writing fiction and study.

R. Scott Bakker's major work is a series known as "The Second Apocalypse," which he began developing in the 1980s. The series was first planned as series of three books. The first two books were to be the "The Prince of Nothing" and "The Aspect-Emperor". The third book has been called "The Book That Shall Not Be Named" by Bakker. He thought the title of this book was a spoiler for the first two books.

Bakker began writing the books in the early 2000s. He found he needed to split each of the three books into its own sub-series to include all of the characters, themes and ideas he wished to explore. The first two books have now become trilogies, and the third book, which is currently two volumes, may expand to a third.

A science fiction novel about a serial killer whose knowledge allows them to control the human brain. Published in 2008.

The story of a private investigator, Disciple Manning, who suffers from a condition like Hyperthymesia. Published in 2010.

Bakker developed ideas which are the basis of his Blind Brain Theory and Heuristic Neglect Theory.

A short essay about his Blind Brain Hypothesis", "published 2008. It was based on ideas that were part of his novel, "Neuropath. "These ideas were about the limits of human consciousness, for example how the eye does not see all the colors because they are beyond our field of vision. We are only aware of a tiny part of all the information our brains process, and this means that what we experience is largely an illusion.

Bakker wrote that the scientific method and its progress would one day give us insights into human behavior that we could not imagine now. He argued in the future there would be some kind of brain–computer interface.

In 2008, Bakker presented "The End of the World As We Know It: Neuroscience and the Semantic Apocalypse" at Western University's Centre for the Study of Theory and Criticism. This was based on ideas from "Neuropath, "a fictional world where the technologies of neuroscience have reached technical and social maturity and prevalence.

Bakker says that science is now used to explain the natural world, rather than folk stories. He says that one day science will also explain how our brains work, and how that affects our behaviour. Human behaviour is not always rational, and society has ignored this cognitive bias. Bakker's Blind Brain Hypothesis is that we are only conscious of a tiny part of the information processed by our brains. Because of this we do not fully understand our thoughts and behaviours. 

Bakker noted the amount of money now being spent to use neuroscience to improve marketing techniques. 

In May 2010, Bakker began a blog called "Three Pound Brain." Bakker has used the blog to explore and write about his philosophical ideas. He also uses it for copies of his past academic work, speculative pieces, and samples and drafts of his fiction writing. 

An essay published on "Scientia Salon," November 2014.

Science fiction short story released in "Midwest Studies in Philosophy".

A paper published in "Cosmos and History," January 2017.

"On Alien Philosophy" was first published on "Three Pound Brain", August 2015, it was later rewritten for the "Journal of Consciousness Studies", Feb 2017.









Deneb

Deneb (also named Arided, α Cygni, alpha Cygni, α Cyg) is the brightest star in the constellation of Cygnus. It, along with Vega, and Altair make up the Summer Triangle asterism.

It has an apparent magnitude of 1.25, which means that it is the 20th brightest star in the night sky. However its distance from the sun and luminosity are difficult to calculate, but it's distance is estimated to be approximately 2,600 light years away. It is thought to be between 55,000 and 196,000 times as luminous as the Sun.

Deneb is a blue supergiant that is 203 times larger than the Sun.

Deneb will be the Pole Star in the year 9800 AD.

John Francis Jackson

John Francis Jackson, DFC (23 February 1908 – 28 April 1942) was an Australian fighter ace and squadron commander of World War II. He had eight aerial victories, and led No. 75 Squadron during the Battle of Port Moresby in 1942. Born in Brisbane, he was a grazier and businessman. He had his own private plane when he joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Reserve in 1936. In 1939, at the start of the war, he was called up for active service. Jackson served with No. 23 Squadron in Australia before he was posted to the Middle East in November 1940. As a fighter pilot with No. 3 Squadron he flew Gloster Gladiators, Hawker Hurricanes and P-40 Tomahawks during the North African and Syria–Lebanon campaigns.

Jackson was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and Mentioned in Despatches for his actions in the Middle East. In March 1942, while serving in the South West Pacific theatre, he was promoted to squadron leader. He was in command of No. 75 Squadron at Port Moresby in Papua, operating P-40 Kittyhawks. Described as "rugged, simple" and "true as steel", Jackson, aged 34, was nicknamed "Old John" by his much younger squadron members. He was praised for his leadership during the defence of Port Moresby. He was killed in action on 28 April 1942. His younger brother Les took over No. 75 Squadron, and also became a fighter ace. Jacksons International Airport, Port Moresby, is named in John Jackson's honour.

Falcon 9

Falcon 9 is a two-stage rocket. It was designed and manufactured by SpaceX in the United States. Parts of the rocket can be used more than one time. The latest version of the first stage can return to Earth and be flown again many times. Both the first and second stages are powered by SpaceX Merlin engines. They use cryogenic liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) as fuel. Its name comes from the fictional Star Wars spacecraft, the "Millennium Falcon". The 9 is for the nine engines of the rocket's first stage. There have been many versions of the rocket. These include v1.0 (2010–2013), v1.1 (2013–2016) and v1.2 Full Thrust (2015–present). It also includes the Falcon 9 Block 5 version.

It also includes the Block 5 Full Thrust version. This version has been used since May 2018. Most rockets can only be used one time. SpaceX has landed Falcon 9 boosters over a hundred times. The first stages have been used as many as eleven times.

Falcon 9 can carry of up to to low Earth orbit (LEO). If fully used, it can carry to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). The rocket can carry to GTO when the first stage is recovered. It has a cargo size of ]145 cubic meters of volume The heaviest GTO loads carried have been Intelsat 35e () and Telstar 19V (). 

In 2008, SpaceX won a Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract in NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program. They would take cargo to the International Space Station (ISS) using the Falcon 9 and Dragon capsule. The first mission under this contract launched on 8 October 2012. Falcon 9 can take NASA astronauts to the ISS. It is also certified for the National Security Space Launch program and NASA Launch Services Program as "Category 3". This means it can be used with the most expensive, important and complex NASA missions. Falcon 9 is said to be the world's most advanced space launch vehicle by many sources. As of January 2021, Falcon 9 has the most launches among all U.S. rockets that are currently being used. It is the only U.S. rocket fully certified for transporting humans to the International Space Station. It is also the only commercial rocket to take humans to orbit. On 24 January 2021, Falcon 9 set a new record for the most satellites launched by a single rocket. It carried 143 satellites into orbit.

Five rockets of the version 1.0 design were launched from June 2010 to March 2013. Version 1.1 had fifteen launches from September 2013 to January 2016. The "Full Thrust" version has been used since December 2015. There are many upgrades to this version. The latest Full Thrust variant, Block 5, was introduced in May 2018. It has more thrust, improved landing legs and other minor improvements to help recovery and reuse. The Falcon Heavy version was first flown in February 2018. It has a stronger Falcon 9 first stage as its center core. It also has two added Falcon 9 first stages used as boosters. SpaceX plans to replace Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy with the much larger Starship launch system.

In October 2005, SpaceX said it was going to launch Falcon 9 in the first half of 2007. The first launch took place in 2010.

SpaceX spent its own money to create the Falcon 1. Creating the Falcon 9 was faster because NASA helped with the cost. They also said they would buy several commercial flights. This started with money from the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in 2006. The contract was a Space Act Agreement (SAA) "to develop and demonstrate commercial orbital transportation service". It included NASA paying for of three demonstration flights. The contract was US$278 million to provide development funding for Dragon, Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9 with Dragon. In 2011 other milestones were added, This made the total contract value US$396 million.

NASA became the main user for the vehicle in 2008. They agreed to buy 12 Commercial Resupply Services launches to the International Space Station. The money would be paid after the demonstration missions were completed successfully. The space logistics delivery contract was worth US$1.6 billion for a minimum of 12 missions to carry supplies to and from the International Space Station.

Elon Musk has said that it would have taken longer without the NASA money.SpaceX has only come this far by building upon the incredible achievements of NASA, having NASA as an anchor tenant for launch, and receiving expert advice and mentorship throughout the development process. SpaceX would like to extend a special thanks to the NASA COTS office for their continued support and guidance throughout this process. The COTS program has demonstrated the power of a true private/public partnership, and we look forward to the exciting endeavors our team will accomplish in the future.

In 2011, SpaceX saidthat Falcon 9 v1.0 costs were about US$300 million. NASA said that costs would have been US$3.6 billion if a traditional cost-plus contract approach had been used. In 2014, SpaceX released total costs for both the Falcon 9 and the Dragon capsule. NASA provided US$396 million. SpaceX provided over US$450 million.

A 2011 NASA report said that it would have cost them about US$4 billion to develop a rocket like the Falcon 9 booster. "A more commercial development" approach might have let the agency to pay only US$1.7 billion".

Congressionaltestimony by SpaceX in 2017 said that the normal NASA process of setting only a requirement and leaving the details to SpaceX let them make the Falcon 9 rocket at a muchlower cost. 

At first, SpaceX wanted to follow the Falcon 1 with a larger capacity vehicle, the Falcon 5. In 2005, SpaceX said it was working on the Falcon 9 instead. They said that they already had a government customer. The Falcon 9 was said to be able of carrying approximately to low Earth orbit. They said it would cost US$27 million per flight with a payload. It would cost US$35 million with a payload. SpaceX also said a heavy version of the Falcon 9 would have a payload capacity of about . The Falcon 9 was intended to enable launches to Low-Earth orbit (LEO), Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO), as well as both crew and cargo vehicles to the International Space Station (ISS). The rocket was not full reusable at this time. This caused the price estimates to be higher than expected.

The original NASA contract called for a demonstration flight of Falcon in September 2008. It also called for all three demonstration missions to be done by September 2009. In February 2008, the plan for the first demo flight was delayed until early 2009. According to Elon Musk, the delay was caused by how cpmplex the work was the rules for launching from Cape Canaveral.

The first test with two engines connected to the first stage was done in January 2008. Other tests led to the Falcon 9 being tested with nine engines. The engine were tested for a full mission length (178 seconds for stage one) in November 2008. In October 2009, the first stage had a successful all-engine test fire for the first time. This was done in McGregor, Texas. In November 2009, SpaceX held the first test of the second stage. This test lasted forty seconds. In January 2010, a full-duration (329 seconds) firing of the Falcon 9 second stage was held. SpaceX scheduled launch date of March 2010. 

In February 2010, SpaceX's first flight stack was set up at Space Launch Complex 40, Cape Canaveral. On 9 March 2010, SpaceX was to test-fire the first stage. The test was stopped 2 seconds before firing. This was because of a failure in the system designed to pump high-pressure helium from the launch pad into the first stage. The problem was with the pad and not with the rocket itself. All of Falcon 9's systems leading up to the abort worked as expected. Another test on 13 March 2010 was successful.

In December 2010, SpaceX was making one Falcon 9 (and Dragon spacecraft) every three months. They wanted to double the rate to one every six weeks. By September 2013, SpaceX's manufacturing space had increased to nearly . The factory had set up to make 40 rocket cores per year. The factory was making one Falcon 9 vehicle per month as of November 2013. The company wanted to increase that to 18 vehicles per year in mid-2014 and 24 per year by the end of 2014. They wanted to be making 40 rocket cores per year by the end of 2015.

These production rates were not achieved by February 2016. The company said that production rate for Falcon 9 cores had only increased to 18 per year. They also said that the number of first stage cores that can be made at one time had doubled from three to six. The rate was expected to grow to 30 cores per year by the end of 2016. Still, By August 2016, SpaceX was working towards a production capacity of 40 cores per year. 

Since 2018, SpaceX has usually reused first stages. This has reduced the need for new cores. In 2021, SpaceX had 31 F9 launches. Only two of those used new boosters. They recovered the booster on all but one flight.

The Falcon 9 is a two-stage rocket. it is powered by LOX and RP-1. Both stages have Merlin 1D rocket engines. The first stage has nine that are adapted for use at sea-level. The second stage has one that is adapted for use in a vacuum. The engines uses a pyrophoric mixture of triethylaluminum-triethylborane (TEA-TEB) to ignite the engine. The first stage engines are set in a form SpaceX calls "Octaweb." Many cores have four landing legs at the base of the Octaweb. To control the core while it falls through the atmosphere, SpaceX uses grid fins. They deploy from the vehicle after separation. The legs deploy moments before landing.
The propellant tank walls and domes are made from aluminum–lithium alloy. The second stage tank of a Falcon 9 is a shorter version of the first stage tank. This decreases the cost to make them. The connection between the two stages is a carbon-fiber and aluminum-core structure. The original stage separation system had twelve attachment points. This was which was reduced to three in the v1.1 launcher.

The Falcon 9 uses a payload fairing to protect satellites during launch. The fairing is long, in diameter, weighs approximately . It is made of a carbon fiber skin on an aluminum honeycomb core. Testing of the design was done at NASA's Plum Brook Station facility in spring 2013.

SpaceX uses multiple flight computers. This makes the system less affected by faults. Each Merlin rocket engine is controlled by three computers. Each of these computers has two processors that check each other. The software runs on Linux. It is written in C++. Each stage has its own flight computers. This is in addition to the controllers on each engine. Each engine microcontroller CPU runs on a PowerPC architecture.

The Falcon 9 rocket can lose up to two of the engines and still complete the mission. Each engine creates of thrust.

The Falcon 9 v1.0 flew five times in 2010–2013. The Falcon 9 v1.1 made its first flight in September 2013. The mission carried a very small payload, the CASSIOPE satellite. It later launched larger things. This included the SES-8 GEO communications satellite. Both Falcon 9 v1.0 and Falcon 9 v1.1 were expendable launch vehicles (ELVs). The Falcon 9 Full Thrust made its first flight in December 2015. The first stage of the Falcon 9 Full Thrust version can be used many times. The current version, known as Falcon 9 Block 5, made its first flight in May 2018.

In 2010, the price of a Falcon 9 v1.0 launch was US$49.9 to US$56 million. By 2012, the listed price range had increased to US$54–US$59.5 million. In August 2013, the price for a Falcon 9 v1.1 was US$56.5 million; it was raised to US$61.2 million by June 2014. Since May 2016, the price for a Falcon 9 Full Thrust mission (allowing booster recovery) is US$62 million. Dragon cargo missions to the ISS have an average cost of US$133 million The DSCOVR mission, for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), cost US$97 million.

In 2004, Elon Musk said "long term plans call for development of a heavy lift product and even a super-heavy, if there is customer demand. [...] Ultimately, I believe US$500 per pound (US$1100/kg) [of payload delivered to orbit] or less is very achievable". At its 2016 price, a Falcon 9 FT launch costs just over US.

In 2011, Musk estimated that materials needed for the Falcon 9 v1.0 launch cost about US$200,000. The first stage uses of liquid oxygen and of RP-1 fuel, while the second stage uses of liquid oxygen and of RP-1.

In October 2019, data from NASA showed that the Falcon 9's "base price" of US$62 million per launch would be lowered to US$52 million for flights scheduled in 2021 and beyond.

CNBC reported in April 2020 that the United States Air Force's launches were costing US$95 million This was because of the extra security used. SpaceX executive Christopher Couluris stated that reusing rockets can bring prices even lower, that it "costs US$28 million to launch it, that's with everything".


Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)

The Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) is the third-level military medal given to members of the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force and other services. It was also given to members of other Commonwealth countries. The medal was awarded for "an act or acts of valour, courage or devotion to duty whilst flying in active operations against the enemy".

The award was established on 3 June 1918, shortly after the formation of the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was originally awarded to RAF officers. During the Second World War, it was also awarded to Royal Artillery officers serving with the RAF as pilots and artillery observers. In 1993 the medal replaced the Distinguished Flying Medal, which had until then been awarded to other ranks. People awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross are allowed to use the post-nominal letters "DFC". A bar is added to the ribbon for holders of the DFC who received a second award.

During the First World War, about 1,100 DFCs were awarded, with 70 first bars and 3 second bars. During the Second World War, 20,354 DFCs were awarded, the most of any award, with about 1,550 first bars and 45 second bars.

Honorary awards were made on 964 occasions to people from other non-Commonwealth countries.

The decoration is a cross flory and is 2⅛ inches wide. The horizontal and bottom bars have bumps at the end, while the upper bar has a rose. The front of the medal has aeroplane propellers, placed on the vertical arms of the cross, and wings on the horizontal arms. In the centre is a laurel wreath around the RAF monogram, with a heraldic Imperial Crown on the top.

The back of the medal has the Royal Cypher in the centre and the year of issue engraved on the lower arm. The decoration is issued named.

The ribbon was originally white with purple broad horizontal stripes. This was changed in 1919 to the current white with purple broad diagonal stripes.

The decoration was designed by Edward Carter Preston.



Paterson Clarence Hughes

Paterson Clarence "Pat" Hughes, DFC (19 September 1917 – 7 September 1940) was an Australian fighter ace of World War II. He served with the Royal Air Force (RAF). During the Battle of Britain he shot down 17 enemy aircraft. This was the highest number of aircraft shot down by an Australian during the battle, and the third highest by an Australian during World War II. Hughes was killed in action on 7 September 1940.

Hughes was born in Numeralla, New South Wales. He joined the Royal Australian Air Force in 1936. After graduating as a pilot, he joined the RAF. In July 1937, he joined No. 64 Squadron, which operated Hawker Demon and, later, Bristol Blenheim fighters. Posted to No. 234 Squadron at the start of World War II, Hughes began flying Supermarine Spitfires. He shared in the squadron's first victory on 8 July 1940, when with two other Spitfires, he shot down a German Junkers Ju 88 attacking ships near Lands End. Hughes was known for attacking his targets at extremely close range. He probably died after his Spitfire was struck by parts from a German Dornier Do 17 bomber that he had just shot down near London. Hughes was able to get out of the plane, but his parachute did not open. After his death he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Hughes was buried in England.

Big Four (British railway companies)

The Big Four was a name used to describe the four largest railway companies in the United Kingdom in the period 1923–47. The name was coined by "The Railway Magazine" in its issue of February 1923: "The Big Four of the New Railway Era".

The Big Four were:


The companies were formed as a result of the Railways Act 1921, in a process known as "The Grouping" (of the railways), which came into effect on 1 January 1923.

On 1 January 1948, the companies were nationalised to form British Railways as a result of the Transport Act 1947.


London, Midland and Scottish Railway

The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) was one of the Big Four British railway companies from 1923 to 1948. It was formed on 1 January 1923 under the Railways Act of 1921, which required the grouping of over 120 separate railways into four. The companies merged into the LMS included the London and North Western Railway, the Midland Railway, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (which had previously merged with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922), several Scottish railway companies (including the Caledonian Railway), and numerous other, smaller ventures.
For the Modern Company, see London Midland.

Christina Kirkman

Christina Marie Kirkman (born February 25, 1993, in Melrose, Massachusetts, USA) is an American actress and comedian. She was best known for her roles in the final two seasons of "All That".

In 2003, she entered "R U All That?: Nickelodeon's Search for the Funniest Kid in America" competition and won the highly-coveted spot as a regular performer on "All That".

As part of her audition, Kirkman was asked to do a skit in which she met Jay Leno. She had never heard of Leno because she had never stayed up late, so she said, ""Who the heck is Jay Leno?"" and instead pretended to talk to Leno's bodyguard.

When asked if she thought she was going get into the "All That" cast, Kirkman responded, "I thought I had no chance!" with a laugh.

Kirkman joined the cast of "All That" in Season 9 after Bryan Hearne left the show. She replaced Jamie Lynn Spears as the youngest cast member of "All That". She remained on "All That" until the show was canceled.

After "All That" came to an end, Kirkman returned to Massachusetts where she experienced bullying. This caused her to temporarily stop acting to focus on school. She graduated from Bishop Finwick High School. In 2015, she graduated from Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts where she studied broadcast journalism and also participated in several different on campus productions.

After completing college, Kirkman moved back to Los Angeles to pursue acting and as of 2016, she completed filming the movie "Night Shadow".

To short an asset means to bet that the asset will lose value, or that the current price is overvalued (higher than its supposed value). If the asset in question does indeed lose value, the person who "shorted" it will win the bet, and make a profit. This can be done by borrowing assets and selling them at a higher price, returning the asset once you can buy it back at a lower price. 

For example, if you think that Tesla stock will lose 10% of its value, you could short the stock, and make a 10% profit once it goes down by 10%. However, if Tesla stock gains value, then you will lose the equivalent amount.

Torque converter

A torque converter, or torque multiplier, is a device for multiplying torque. It is widely used in transmission systems for road and rail vehicles with internal combustion engines.

The diagram shows a hydraulic torque converter. It contains two turbines and a stator.

The driven turbine can deliver high torque at low speed. As the vehicle accelerates, the speed goes up and the torque goes down. This happens automatically, so there is no need for the driver to change gear.

Blockchain

A Blockchain (or block chain) is a series of digital entries, which cannot be easily changed once they are created. It is commonly used in cryptocurrency. It is how digital transactions are recorded and verified. This is done by using several concepts from cryptography, including digital signatures and hash functions. In very basic terms, a blockchain combines the following two ideas:

In most cases, a blockchain is managed by a peer-to-peer network. All peers use a common protocol that specifies how they should communicate with each other, how a new block is created and validated. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be changed easily any more. Changing the block means all the blocks after it need to be changed as well. Depending on the protocol, this will require a majority of the peers, or even all the peers, to agree.

Blockchains are secure by design. Blockchain technology is used where keeping a correct record is important. Use cases include medical records, identity management, food traceability, gaming and voting.

Blockchain was invented by Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta in 1991 as a means to assure the integrity of digital records. Haber and Stornetta launched the world's first commercial blockchain; Surety in 1995.

In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto included as references 3 and 4 of Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System, the two papers by Haber and Stornetta to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. Because of its blockchain, bitcoin became the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications.
