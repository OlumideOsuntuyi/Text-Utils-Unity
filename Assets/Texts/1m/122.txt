Sexual addiction

Sexual addiction is when people engage in sexual activities, especially sexual intercourse, even if this has negative consequences for them. Some scientists believe it is one of several sex-related disorders within an umbrella concept known as hypersexual disorder. The term "sexual dependence" is also used to refer to people who report being unable to control their sexual urges, behaviors, or thoughts. Other related models of pathological sexual behavior include hypersexuality (nymphomania and satyriasis), erotomania, Don Juanism (or Don Juanitaism), and paraphilia-related disorders.

Not all people agree that the condition sexual addicion exists. There is considerable debate among psychiatrists, psychologists, sexologists, and other specialists whether compulsive sexual behavior constitutes an addiction. They also disagree about its classification and possible diagnosis. Research on animals has shown that compulsive sexual behavior uses the same mechanism of action that is also responsible for drug addiction in laboratory animals. As of 2018, neither the DSM or ICD medical classifications recognise sexual addiction as a valid diagnosis.

Parker Solar Probe

Parker Solar Probe is a NASA robotic space probe heading towards the outer corona of the Sun. It will reach to within 8.86 solar radii (6.2 million kilometers or 3.85 million miles) from the "surface" of the Sun and is currently the fastest spacecraft ever built and will travel, at closest approach, as fast as .

It was launched on August 12, 2018. This was the first time a NASA spacecraft was named after a living person, honoring physicist Eugene Parker.

A memory card having the names of over 1.1 million people was mounted on a plaque and installed below the spacecraft’s high-gain antenna on May 18, 2018.

The card also contains photos of Parker, professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and a copy of his 1958 scientific paper.

Because of how close the probe will be to the Sun, it will experience very high temperatures. To make sure that the probe is not damaged by the hot environment, engineers had to design a special shield to protect the sensitive components on the probe. The shield is made up of five layers. The outermost layer is a white ceramic layer which reflects away the Sun's rays. By reflecting the rays away, it prevents the shield from heating up too much. The second layer is a barrier layer which connects the ceramic layer to the middle layer. The middle layer is a carbon-carbon sheet which is very light and strong. This helps keep the shield in one piece. The fourth layer is a carbon foam which is very light and does not conduct heat well. This again helps with keeping the temperature low. The fifth and final layer is a second carbon sheet which makes the entire shield rigid enough for spaceflight.

Since the probe was launched from a rocket, it was very important to minimize its weight. If it was too heavy, the rocket would not be able to launch it far enough to complete its mission. Because of the well engineered materials in the shield, the entire shield only weighs 73 kg. That is about the same weight as an average adult human.

Eugene Parker

Eugene Newman Parker (June 10, 1927 – March 15, 2022) was an American solar astrophysicist. In the mid-1950s—developed the theory of the supersonic solar wind and predicted the Parker spiral shape of the solar magnetic field in the outer solar system. 

In 1987, Parker proposed that the solar corona might be heated by myriad tiny "nanoflares" (similar to solar flares) that would happen all over the surface of the Sun.

Parker spent four years at the University of Utah and has been at the University of Chicago since 1955. Parker was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1967.

In 2017, NASA renamed its "Solar Probe Plus" to "Parker Solar Probe" in his honor, marking the first time NASA had named a spacecraft after a living person. 

In 2018, the American Physical Society awarded him the Medal for Exceptional Achievement in Research.

Parker died on March 15, 2022 from problems caused by Parkinson's disease at a retirement home in Hyde Park, Chicago, Illinois at the age of 94.

In 2012, O'Rourke filed for the Democratic primary against the eight-term Silvestre Reyes to represent Texas's 16th congressional district.

He posted to social media daily, including Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, and livestreamed his activities traveling the state, such as skateboarding in a Whataburger parking lot, washing clothes at a laundromat, and "blockwalking" in his constituents' neighborhoods.

Altair

Altair, also called α Aquilae, α Aql, is the brightest star in the constellation of Aquila.

It is the twelfth brightest star in the night sky. It is in the G-cloud—a fog of gas and dust known as an interstellar cloud. Altair is an A-type main sequence star with an apparent visual magnitude of 0.77. It is one of the vertices of the Summer Triangle (the other two vertices are Deneb and Vega). It is 16.7 light-years (5.13 parsecs) from the Sun and is one of the closest stars visible to the naked eye.

Altair spins rapidly, with a velocity at its equator of about 286 km/s. This is a significant fraction of the star's estimated breakup speed of 400 km/s. A study with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer showed that Altair is not spherical, but is flattened at the poles due to its high rate of rotation. Other interferometric studies with multiple telescopes, operating in the infrared, have confirmed this.

Naval Air Station Glenview

The Naval Air Station Glenview (NASG) was a military air base in Glenview, Illinois.

The base began as Curtiss Reynolds Wright Airport in 1929. The Curtiss Flying Service bought farmland in the Glenview region and opened the airfield as an alternative to Chicago's Municipal Airport. But the Great Depression, which started just nine days after the airfield was dedicated, reduced the need for another regular airport for Chicago. During the Depression, the main source of income for the airport was air shows. However, in the late 1930s, there were also some commercial routes to and from the airfield.

In the 1930s, the airfield was used as a training center for military airmen. In 1937, the U.S. Navy moved to the airbase. ("Although the airport managed to survive . . . the Great Depression, the navy's decision to relocate the Great Lakes aviation program to Glenview likely saved Curtiss Airfield." ) The United States Naval Reserve Aviation Base (NRAB) was the name given to the training unit. On November 1, 1939, the base was notified that the Department of the navy had approved a lease on the airport. When the United States joined World War Two, activity increased at the base. It became a major training base for training pilots water-related flying. This included training for aircraft carrier-based flights.

After the war, the base reduced its activities. In 1950, though, marines and naval personnel from the base were called up to fight in the Korean War. Later in the 1950s, and in the later decades, the base hosted various community events such as national model-airplane contests In 1963, the Seabees became based there. In 1971, the base was officially annexed by the village of Glenview.

During the Vietnam War, military activity at the base increased. This included serving as the receiving base of wounded personnel who were being taken to Great Lakes Naval Hospital for treatment.

In the 1980s, the base population grew. Military units present at the base included the u. S. Coast Guard's search and rescue unit for southern Lake Michigan.

In 1991, personnel from NASG took part in Operation Desert Storm. But the end of the base had already been established years before, by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, in 1988. In 1993, the last NASG air show was performed before 70,000 viewers. In August 1994, the last KC-130 flight out of the airfield left for NAS Carswell, Fort Worth, Texas.

After the air station was closed, most of the facilities were torn down, and the area was converted to civilian use, including a prairie nature area, upscale housing, and a shopping district (Glen Town Center)centered around the old Hangar One, which was preserved and incorporated into a shopping mall, in a part of Glenview now called The Glen. The small, associated Navy Park and the rededicated hangar were opened in 2003. The old hangar is on the National Register of Historic Places.

Also, additional weight at the time due to ongoing rehabilitation construction led to the major failure that caused the bridge to fall into the Mississippi River. It later was replaced with the I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge which opened in September 2008. The new bridge that opened in 2008 carries 10 lanes.

Phantom smell

A phantom smell or olfactory hallucination is smelling an odor that is not actually there. It is also called phantosmia. It can occur in one nostril or both. Phantosmia with unpleasant smells, which is called cacosmia, is more common. It is often described as smelling something that is burned, foul, spoiled, or rotten. Experiencing phantom smells from time to time is normal and usually goes away on its own. When hallucinations of this type do not seem to go away or when they keep coming back, this can be very upsetting and can lower an individual's quality of life.

Common medical conditions such as nasal infections, nasal polyps, or dental problems can cause phantom smells. A phantom smell can also result from neurological conditions such as migraines, head injuries, strokes, Parkinson's disease, seizures, or brain tumors. It can also be a symptom of certain mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, intoxication or withdrawal from drugs and alcohol, or psychotic disorders. Certain substances in the environment can also cause phantom smells. These include tobacco smoke, certain types of chemicals (e.g., insecticides or solvents), or radiation treatment for head or neck cancer.

A physician can determine if the problem is with the sense of smell (olfactory system) or taste (gustatory system), or if it is caused by a neurological or psychiatric disorder. Phantosmia usually goes away on its own. Sometimes this occurs step by step. The process can take several years. When a phantom smell is caused by an illness (e.g., sinusitis), it should go away with theillness. If the problem persists or causes significant discomfort, a doctor might recommend nasal saline drops, antidepressant or anticonvulsant medications, anesthesia to parts of the nose, or in very rare circumstances, surgical procedures to remove the olfactory nerves or bulbs.

Ain't

The word ain't is a contraction of "is not", "have not", "are not" and "has not" in English vernacular.

The development for "ain't" happened independently and at different times. The usage of "ain't" for the forms of "to be not" was established during the 18th century, and "to have not" by the early 19th century.

The using of "ain't" is a major subject of controversy in English. The word is used by many speakers in oral and informal settings. But its use is often with stigma.

"Ain't" is found all across the English-speaking world in many regions and classes. The word is of a nonstandard nature. 

"Ain't" is used all over the United Kingdom. Its geographical distribution has increased over time. It is also found all over the United States, including in the South, New England, the Mid-Atlantic States, the Appalachia and the Upper Midwest.

Nipple discharge

Nipple discharge is fluid that comes out of the nipple of the breast and is not milk or caused by pregnancy or breastfeeding. The discharge can be different colors. It can be thick or thin. Nipple discharge can come from one breast or both. Many men have had nipple discharge. Nipple discharge in men is not normal. Ninety-seven percent of the time, nipple discharge is not cancer. 

Sometimes discharge from nipples will get better and not need treatment. Once in a while it can be a sign of breast cancer. Newborn babies can have milky nipple discharge. This is because hormones from the mother cause milk to develop in the baby. This kind of discharge goes away in 2 weeks.

Here are some of the reasons for nipple discharge:

Some medications can cause nipple discharge. These medicines are opioids, antideptressants, birth control pills, antihypertensives, and antipsychotics. A woman can have changes in her breasts as she gets older. Some of these changes can be the cause of nipple discharge.

A doctor or nurse will often ask a woman to have a examination. Medical tests can find the reason for the nipple discharge. A mammogram and ultrasound are two tests that a doctor might use. The doctor may want to get a sample of the fluid by using a needle to take it out. The fluid that comes out of the nipple may be collected and tested.

Sometimes nipple discharge is treated with an operation. Even after surgery another operation may be needed.

William Blackstone

Sir William Blackstone (10 July 1723 – 14 February 1780) was an English jurist, judge and Tory party politician of the eighteenth century. He is most noted for writing the "Commentaries on the Laws of England". 

Born into a middle-class family in London, Blackstone was educated at Charterhouse School before matriculating at Pembroke College, Oxford in 1738. After completing a Bachelor of Civil Law degree, he was made a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford in November 1743.

Blackstone was admitted to Middle Temple, and called to the Bar there in 1746. Following a slow start to his career as a barrister, Blackstone became heavily involved in university administration, becoming accountant, treasurer and bursar on 28 November 1746 and Senior Bursar in 1750. On 3 July 1753 he formally gave up his practice as a barrister and started a series of lectures on English law, the first of their kind. The lectures on law were massively successful. They earnt him a total of £453 (£) per year, and led to the publication of "An Analysis of the Laws of England" in 1756. This repeatedly sold out and was used to preface his later works.

Blackstone was made the first Vinerian Professor of English Law. He published a very successful second book, titled "A Discourse on the Study of the Law". With his growing fame, Blackstone successfully returned to the bar and maintained a good practice, also securing election as Tory Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Hindon on 30 March 1761. In November 1765 he published the first of four volumes of "Commentaries on the Laws of England", his most important work. When completed, the work earned Blackstone £14,000 (£ in 2024 terms). After some failures, he got appointed to the judiciary as a judge until his death, on 14 February 1780.

Pantry

A pantry is a room where food and other household goods may be stored for a while.

Some food, such as butter, eggs, milk, and such need to be kept cool. Before modern refrigeration was available, there was the pantry. The pantry was a room or large cupboard made to keep cooler than the temperature in the kitchen. Built on the north side of the house close to the kitchen, it had no windows, but had air ventilation. The walls were brick or wood. As the air in the pantry warmed, it rose, escaping through the upper vent. This in turn drew cooler air in from the lower vent, providing constant circulation of cooler air. 

In the summertime, the temperatures in the pantry would be several degrees lower than the ambient temperature in the house. In wintertime, the temperature in the cold pantry would be considerably lower than that in the kitchen.

A pantry was the place to keep foodstocks that did not need to be kept refrigerated. Remember, food was bought regularly in those days, and not stored for long. Breads, butter, cheesecakes, eggs, pastries, and pies were kept in a cold. Vegetables could be brought up from the cellar in smaller amounts and stored in the cold pantry until ready to use. The pantry was a place to store fresh berries and fruit, cheese, butter and such.

Shrek Forever After

Shrek Forever After (also known as Shrek: The Final Chapter or simply Shrek 4) is a 2010 American computer-animated comedy drama movie by DreamWorks Animation. It is the fourth and final part in the "Shrek" movie franchise. It is the sequel to "Shrek the Third" (2007). 

The movie was directed by Mike Newell, and Mike Mitchell. It stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, Julie Andrews, and John Cleese with Walt Dohrn as Rumpelstiltskin. 

It was theatrically released in the United States by DreamWorks Animation on May 21, 2010, in 3D and IMAX 3D formats.

Shrek has grown increasingly tired of being a family man and celebrity, missing the days when he was feared and had privacy. While celebrating his children's first birthday in Far Far Away, Shrek storms out in anger. He is invited inside Rumpelstiltskin's carriage. Rumpelstiltskin offers him a deal to receive a day as a "real ogre" in exchange for a day from his childhood. Shrek signs a contract fulfilling this wish, and apparates to another reality.

Now feared by the villagers in this new version of reality, Shrek has fun until he discovers that his swamp is deserted and his home is not there Captured by witches, Shrek is taken to Rumpelstiltskin , who is now the King. Rumpelstiltskin reveals to Shrek that he took the day he was born, meaning Shrek never existed in this timeline. This also means that Fiona was never rescued from her imprisonment. Shrek escapes Rumpelstiltskin's castle with Donkey.

Donkey helps Shrek find a hidden exit clause; the contract can be destroyed by "true love's kiss". The pair soon encounter a Fiona leading an army of ogres in a resistance against Rumpelstiltskin and the witches. Shrek unsuccessfully tries to kiss Fiona, who has since lost hope of finding true love after not being rescued, and is too busy preparing an ambush on Rumpelstiltskin.

During the ambush, most of the ogres are captured by the Pied Piper, who was hired by Rumpelstiltskin, but Shrek and Fiona escape with Puss in Boots and Donkey. Later on, Rumpel publicly offers a wish to anyone who brings him Shrek, and after hearing this, Shrek turns himself in. Rumpelstiltskin is forced to grant Shrek's wish, and he uses it to free the other ogres. As Shrek is locked up, Rumpel reveals that Fiona had been captured and not released, since she is not "all ogre" (she turns into human during the day, as her curse was not stopped because she was never rescued). Donkey, Puss, and the freed ogres attack the castle and fight the witches.

As the sun rises, Shrek begins to fade from existence, but Fiona, having fallen in love with him, kisses him just before he disappears. Seeing that she is still an ogre in the sunlight, Fiona realizes that her curse was broken and that the true love's kiss worked. This also means that the contract has been destroyed. The alternate reality falls apart and everybody in it dies.

Shrek finds himself transported back to the original timeline at the moment before he left the party. Shrek embraces his family and friends with a newfound appreciation for them.

Denisovan

The Denisovans or Denisova hominins are archaic humans in the genus "Homo". They are either an extinct species or subspecies. 

They were first discovered in in the Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains in Siberia. This cave that has also been lived in by Neanderthals and modern humans. 

A finger bone fragment of a juvenile female was discovered. She lived about 41,000 years ago, with about 3% to 5% of the DNA of Melanesians and Aboriginal Australians and around 6% in Papuans deriving from Denisovans.

The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the finger bone showed it was genetically distinct from Neanderthals and modern humans. The nuclear genome from this specimen suggested that Denisovans shared a common origin with Neanderthals. 

DNA analysis has indicated that modern humans, Neanderthals, and the Denisova hominin last shared a common ancestor around years ago.

The mtDNA analysis also suggested that this species was the result of a migration out of Africa that came between a migration by "Homo erectus" individuals and later ones by some ancestors of most modern humans.

So far, the fossils of four distinct Denisovans from Denisova Cave have been identified through their DNA: Denisova 2, Denisova 3, Denisova 4, and Denisova 8. Denisova 2 and Denisova 3 are young females,and Denisova 4 and Denisova 8 are adult males. 

So far, only a finger bone, a toe bone and two teeth are the only body parts that have been found.  The finger bone is from a woman.  It is broader than a human finger.  This fact suggests that Denisovans were more robust than any modern humans.

The mtDNA from the finger bone differs from that of modern humans by 385 nucleotides in the mtDNA strand out of approximately 16,500. This  is more than the difference between modern humans and Neanderthals, which is around 202 bases.

Toyota/Save Mart 350

The Toyota/Save Mart 350 is a Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series stock car race held annually at Sonoma Raceway at Sears Point in Sonoma, California, It is one of three races held on road courses, with the other two being the Go Bowling at The Glen at Watkins Glen International and the Bank of America Roval 400 at Charlotte Motor Speedway.

The race joined the circuit in 1989, It was added as a replacement for the Budweiser 400 at Riverside, which closed in 1988, The race had undergone several name and length changes throughout the year, The NASCAR West Series is held as combination race from 1989 to 1997 and has held as a standalone race since 2006. Due to the track's unique layout, the race generates annual discussion, with media, fans and participants both in favor and against racing this event, Due to the speedway's layout, Road course ringers are common, A NASCAR term standing for drivers only on road course races.

From 1989-1997, NASCAR had utilized the full , best known for sports car racing, Subtle changes to some of the turns accommodated the stock cars, and increased passing widths, Ricky Rudd won the inaugural race at Sonoma.

In the 1991 race, Sonoma became famous, With seven laps remaining in the race, Mark Martin tried to pass Tommy Kendall, who cut his tire, subbing for an injured Kyle Petty, The two made contact, resulting in Martin crashing and running into Davey Allison, cutting his tire. and the lead went to Davey Allison, Then with 2 laps to go, Ricky Rudd passed Allison for the lead, but spun out from contact in the final turn.

Ricky Rudd led the field to the white flag, and contended to win the race, his second victory at Sonoma, and to advance in championship standings, However, as he came around to take the win, Rudd was black-fagged just 3 feet from the finish line, Davey Allison was declared the winner and Rudd finished in second place.

The last Sonoma race was held at the previous road course passage was in 1997 on October 5 at a Truck Series event, There, Joe Ruffmann won the race but controversy erupted when Rich Bickle blamed a loss of top-ten finishes on rookie Boris Said, Rich Bickle cut down a tire, and in reply, Boris Said ran in to Bickle and waited for him to come around and crash him, NASCAR after a brief red flag for a massive crash in a wall of tires, disqualified Said and placed him $10,000 for his actions.

In 1998, the circuit for the event was shortened to a modified road course with the addition of the "Chute" from Turn 4 to Turn 7, bypassing Turn 5 and 6.

In 2001, the "Chute" was modified to such that the NASCAR circuit measured long.

From 1989 to 2001, the pit road could modify up to 34 pit stalls, In the early years, some teams were required to share pit stalls, while the other teams were forced to pit inside the garage area.

After a few years, A makeshift auxiliary pit road was constructed inside the hairpin (turn 11), nicknamed Gilligan's Island, Cars that had nine slowest qualifying speeds were relegated to the pit stalls, Pitting in this area was considered as an inconvenience and a competitive disadvantage, more so than the even the disadvantages one would experience pitting on the back straightaway at a short period of time.

Since the length of the auxilary pit road, was significantly shorter than the other pit road, the cars that pitted were held from 15–20 seconds in order to make up for the time that would have been if the cars had traveled the entire pit road.

Pitting on Gilligan's Island had several other inconveniences, The location (the staging area for the drag races, was landlocked by the race course, and crew members were unable to leave once the race began, Teams sent the only pit crew to Gilligan's Island, and once they were there, they could not access the garage area or their transporters, to collect spare parts/tools, The only repairs that could be made were routine tire changes and refueling, as well as major repairs, If a team pitting on Gilligan's Island dropped out of the race, The crewman were unable to pack their supplies and prepare to leave (a common practice at other tracks) until the race was over.

Changes to the track in 2002 that included separation of the drag strip from the frontstretch, removal of the main drag strip grandstand, and new control tower for road racing led to the pit road being expanded by extending pit road into the main straight and moving the pit exit up past turn 1, thereby expanding it to 43 cars, and Gilligan's Island was abandoned.

The trophy was in form of wine bottle holder paired with a giant wine glass as a nod to NAPA County's wine country.

Endometriosis

Endometriosis is a sickness that is caused by womb tissue that begins growing outside the womb. Endometriosis tissue can be attached to the outer surface of the womb, Fallopian tubes, and the ovaries. Many women between 15 and 44 years-old may have this sickness. It is also found in women 30-40 years-old. If a woman has endometriosis, it can sometimes affect having a baby. Endometriosis can be treated by a doctor, but it cannot be cured. Treating endometriosis may help a woman get pregnant. Women with endometriosis may have painful sex, a feeling of bloating, belly pain, difficult urination and blood in the urine. A woman could have menstrual problems. If endometriosis is on the ovaries, cysts may grow. These areas may develop scar tissue. Some women have more of a risk of endometriosis than others. These are the risk factors: never giving birth, short menstrual cycles, starting periods at young age, having heavy menstrual periods longer than seven days, going through menopause in older age, and having a relative with endometriosis.

A woman can have endometriosis for a long time. It can be very painful. This sickness can be so painful that it affects many areas of life. Endometriosis is hard to find in some women. To find endometriosis a doctor may do many medical tests. These tests may be a pelvic exam and an ultrasound. When a woman has a pelvic exam the doctor will feel for lumps or scars. An ultrasound will help the doctor see endometriosis on the ovaries. The doctor may put a wand-shaped ultrasound probe into the vagina. An ultrasound scanner may be used on the abdomen. Another test may be used. It is called an MRI. The MRI takes a picture of the inside of the body to find endometriosis.

A doctor may treat endometriosis with medicine. There are different kinds of medicine that treat endometriosis. Birth control medicine can help some women have less pain. Another kind of medicine is called Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. If the pain is less after taking medicine then the doctor may decide that the woman has endometriosis. If the woman stops taking the medicine the pain may come back.

Endometriosis is sometimes treated with surgery. This is called laparoscopic surgery. The doctor doing the surgery can look inside the body to find endometriosis tissue and remove it. The doctor may see endometriosis tissue during laparoscopy. A doctor may remove a sample and study it under the microscope to decide treatment.


Univers

Univers is the name of a sans-serif typeface family designed by Adrian Frutiger and released in 1957. It is sans-serif in a geometrical style. It was made in a huge range of weights and widths. Univers was based on a much earlier design of about 1898, called Akzidenz-Grotesk.

Univers was one of the first typeface families to fulfil the idea that a typeface should form a family of consistent, related designs. By creating a matched range of styles and weights, Univers allowed documents to be created in one consistent typeface for all text documents. This matched the desire among practitioners of the "Swiss style" of typography for neutral sans-serif typefaces avoiding artistic excesses. By "excesses" might be meant blackletter, which had been used earlier in German language publications. But Univers also leaves out all the styling of the classical Roman lettering, including the use of serifs at the end of letter strokes.

One important influence was the coming of modernism, with its rejection of tradition in favour of plain function. That is mentioned by most of the people who promoted Univers and other sans serif fonts. Critics of Univers critics point to its lack of character, and monotony when used (as it is) on a huge variety of printed forms. 

Historian James Mosley has described it as "probably the last major" release of a large family as metal type. The font is available for phototypesetting and computer typesetting. It is marketed under licence by almost all outlets serving the print industry.

20 Fenchurch Street

20 Fenchurch Street is a commercial skyscraper in London that takes its name from its address on Fenchurch Street, in the historic City of London financial district. It has been nicknamed "The Walkie-Talkie" because of its distinctive shape. The 34-storey building is tall, making it the fifth-tallest building in the City of London.

Designed by architect Rafael Viñoly and costing over £200 million, 20 Fenchurch Street features a highly distinctive top-heavy form which appears to burst upward and outward. A large viewing deck, bar and restaurants are included on the top three floors; these are open to the public.

The tower was originally proposed at nearly tall but its design was scaled down after concerns about its visual impact on the nearby St Paul's Cathedral and Tower of London. It was subsequently approved in 2006 with the revised height. Even after the height reduction there were continued concerns from heritage groups about its impact on the surrounding area. The project was consequently the subject of a public inquiry; in 2007 this ruled in the developers' favour and the building was granted full planning permission.

In their preliminary results for 2007, joint-developers Land Securities and Canary Wharf Group said 20 Fenchurch Street would be completed in 2011, however in 2009 during the depths of the Great Recession, the estimated completion was changed to 2014.

Wild Frontier

Wild Frontier is the sixth solo studio album by Irish guitarist Gary Moore, released in 1987. His first studio effort after a trip back to his native Belfast, Northern Ireland in 1985. The album contains several songs about Ireland and even the music itself is steeped in Celtic roots. The album is dedicated to the memory of Moore's close friend and former Thin Lizzy bandmate Phil Lynott, who died on 4 January 1986, with the words "For Philip" on the rear cover.

"Wild Frontier" contains the hit single "Over the Hills and Far Away", which reached No. 20 in the UK, as well as a cover of the Easybeats' song "Friday on My Mind". The Max Middleton-penned "The Loner" which was originally recorded by Cozy Powell for his "Over the Top" album in 1979 (on which Moore performed, but not on Powell's recording of "The Loner"). The track was substantially altered by Moore for his own recording, that is why he is credited as a co-writer.

All drums on "Wild Frontier" are sequenced with a drum machine, although the programming is uncredited in the liner notes of the album. Future Toto drummer Simon Phillips would appear on the music video for "Over the Hills and Far Away," as well in early promotions for the album. He would be replaced by former Black Sabbath drummer Eric Singer for the tour, before leaving shortly afterwards to form Badlands.

"Over the Hills and Far Away" was covered by the Finnish symphonic power metal band Nightwish on their 2001 EP of the same title, and by Swedish viking metal band Thyrfing on their album "Urkraft". The Spanish band Saurom also recorded a cover of this song with alternative lyrics, titled "La Disolución de la Comunidad".




Quatermass II

Quatermass II is a British science-fiction series, originally broadcast by BBC Television in the autumn of 1955. It is the second in the "Quatermass" series by writer Nigel Kneale, and the oldest of those serials to survive in its entirety in the BBC archives.

Although sometimes compared unfavourably to the first and third "Quatermass" serials, "Quatermass II" was praised for its allegorical concerns of the damaging effects of industrialisation and the corruption of governments by big business. It is described on the British Film Institute's "Screenonline" website as "compulsive viewing."

On 22 September 1955 the ITV network was launched in the UK, bringing commercial television to Britain for the first time and ending the BBC's broadcasting monopoly in the country. The new network's creation had been established by the Television Act 1954, and the BBC had known in advance that they would need programmes to combat the new rival for television audiences. Referring to the 1953 science-fiction serial "The Quatermass Experiment" in a memo written in 1954, BBC Television's Controller of Programmes, Cecil McGivern, noted that: "Had competitive television been in existence then, we would have killed it every Saturday night while ["The Quatermass Experiment"] lasted. We are going to need "many" more 'Quatermass Experiment' programmes."

Reginald Tate, who had played the title role in "The Quatermass Experiment", collapsed and died on 23 August 1955, aged 58. This was less than a month before the shooting of the location filming for "Quatermass II" began, and necessitated the casting of a replacement lead actor at short notice; John Robinson was chosen to fill the part. Robinson was an experienced actor from a range of different films and television programmes since the 1930s, but was uncomfortable about taking over from Tate, and had difficulty in learning some of the technical dialogue he was required to deliver. Robinson's delivery of his lines has been criticised by some later reviewers.

The available British television audience had doubled since "The Quatermass Experiment" had been shown in 1953, and the viewing figures for "Quatermass II" were accordingly higher. The series gained an audience of 7.9 million viewers for its first three episodes, which rised to 8.3 million for the fourth and fifth and concluded with 9 million. A BBC audience research report commissioned after "Quatermass II" had finished found that 90% of those questioned in the sample had watched at least five episodes of the production.

As with "The Quatermass Xperiment", the film rights to the series were purchased by Hammer Film Productions — in this case after they had only read the scripts, before the series was even made. Titled "Quatermass 2", the film was released in 1957 and once again directed by Val Guest, with Brian Donlevy starring; unlike the first film, Kneale wrote the screenplay himself. In the United States, the film was released under the title "Enemy from Space".

In April 2005 BBC Worldwide released a DVD box set of all their existing "Quatermass" material. This included digitally restored versions of all six episodes of "Quatermass II", with the sound and vision of the recordings cleaned up as far as possible, and some of the existing special effects inserts that survived on their original film elements being re-inserted into the episodes.

In 2016 released "Quatermass II" and "Quatermass and the Pit".


Thief II: The Metal Age

Thief II: The Metal Age is a 2000 stealth video game developed by Looking Glass Studios and published by Eidos Interactive. Like its predecessor "", the game follows Garrett, a master thief who works in and around a steampunk metropolis called the City. The player assumes the role of Garrett as he unravels a conspiracy related to a new religious sect. Garrett takes on missions such as burglaries and frameups, while trying to avoid detection by guards and automated security.

"Thief II" received positive reviews from critics, and its initial sales were stronger than those of its predecessor. However, the game's royalties were gained slowly, which made Looking Glass's financial troubles worse. As a result, the company closed in May 2000, with plans for "Thief III" cancelled. The third game in the series, entitled "", was developed by Ion Storm and published by Eidos in 2004. "Thief 2X: Shadows of the Metal Age", a widely praised expansion mod for "Thief II", was released in 2005. In 2014, Square Enix published a reboot of the series, developed by Eidos Montréal.

"Thief II" is a stealth game that takes place from a first-person perspective in a three-dimensional (3D) graphical environment. The player seeks to complete mission objectives and to evade the notice of opponents such as guards. The player must minimize the visibility and audibility of the player character, Garrett, to escape detection. Players try to avoid lit areas and loud flooring in favor of shadows and quiet flooring. A light monitor on the heads-up display (HUD) indicates the player character's visibility. While it is possible for the player character to engage in direct combat, he is easily defeated.

"Thief 2" debuted high on the bestsellers list for computer games, and its initial sales were better than those of its commercially successful predecessor. By November 2000, its global sales had surpassed 220,000 copies; "PC Zone" described these figures as "commercial acclaim." The United States alone accounted for 67,084 sales by the end of 2000, which drew in revenues of $2.37 million. The game later received a "Silver" sales award by the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. "Thief II" also received positive reviews from critics, with an aggregate score of 87 on Metacritic and 89.14% on GameRankings.

Social Democratic Party (UK)

The Social Democratic Party (also known as the SDP) was a centrist political party that was made by Labour Party politicians in 1981 who did not like how left-wing the party was becoming. The SDP was founded on 26 March 1981 by four senior Labour Party moderates, dubbed the "Gang of Four": Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams.

They allied with the Liberals, winning 25% of the vote in 1983 and 23% in 1987. The alliance between the SDP and the Liberals was called the "SDP-Liberal Alliance". Most of the SDP and Liberals merged in 1988 to form the Liberal Democrats.

David Owen continued to lead a much reduced party until 1990. It continued with even less success until In November 2018 it got its first and only European parliamentarian when Patrick O'Flynn, Member of the European Parliament for East of England, defected from the UK Independence Party.

At the 2022 local elections it gained a seat on Leeds City Council from Labour and, later that year, a Conservative Derbyshire Dales District Councillor defected to the party. They won a second council seat on Leeds City Council in 2023.

25 Old Broad Street

Tower 42 is the third-tallest skyscraper in the City of London and the eighth tallest in Greater London. Its original name was the National Westminster Tower, having been built to house the National Westminster Bank's international division. Seen from above, the shape of the tower resembles that of the NatWest logo (three chevrons in a hexagonal arrangement).

The tower, designed by Richard Seifert and engineered by Pell Frischmann, is located at 25 Old Broad Street. It was built by John Mowlem & Co between 1971 and 1980, first occupied in 1980, and formally opened on 11 June 1981 by Queen Elizabeth II.

The construction cost was £72 million (approximately £ today). It is high, which made it the tallest building in the United Kingdom until the topping out of One Canada Square at Canary Wharf in 1990. It held the status of tallest building in the City of London for 30 years, until it was surpassed by the Heron Tower in December 2009.

Asteroid impact prediction

Asteroid impact prediction warns about asteroids hitting Earth, and when and where they will hit the Earth. Most asteroids will not hit Earth. Asteroid impact prediction works by finding the ones that will hit Earth. It finds asteroids that might hit Earth in the future. This works well for big asteroids as they can be seen easily from a long distance, many years before they come close to Earth. 

There aren't many big asteroids, but there are millions of smaller space rocks. They are not normally bright enough to see until they are close to Earth. We use telescopes to find the asteroids that are going to hit Earth soon. The telescopes are not good enough to see the small asteroids unless everything is perfect. Because of this we almost never see them before they hit Earth.

The IAU Minor Planet Center (MPC) looks after all the asteroid information in the world. NASA's Sentry System is always checking the MPC asteroid information. It checks if any asteroids could hit earth in the future. It has not yet found any. The asteroid which is most likely to hit Earth is called . NASA thinks it will pass Earth in September 2095. They think it has less than a 1 in 10 chance of hitting Earth.

In the early 21st century impact prediction usually doesn't work. Almost all of the asteroids that hit Earth are a surprise. NASA wants to get better at impact prediction by building more powerful telescopes. A big new telescope, made for searching, is being built in northern Chile called the LSST. It is very big and will take years to build. It should be ready by 2023. When it is ready the powerful telescope should be a lot better at seeing small asteroids. 

Telescopes on the Earth can only see part of the sky. They won't be able to see any asteroids coming from near the direction of the Sun because of the blue sky during the day. A telescope in space doesn't have that problem. It can see much more of the sky around Earth. It can keep looking all through the day and night and there are no clouds or rain in space. Telescopes in space can also use infrared heat radiation to find asteroids. Looking for that kind of light is an especially good way of finding asteroids. This method doesn't work on Earth because the air is too warm. Heat radiation from warm air hides the heat radiation that comes from the asteroids. Space telescopes are better in a lot of ways, but they cost more money. Also, they don't last as long as telescopes on the ground.

In 2017 NASA had lots of ideas to help find smaller asteroids. They want to find 9 out of 10 of the asteroids that are bigger than 140 metres (as long as two jumbo jets). The ideas should help find asteroids which are smaller than 140 metres long too. Quite a lot of the ideas use a new telescope on the ground working with a new space telescope. An example telescope on the ground is LSST. An example telescope in space is NEOCAM, but nobody has started building it. These new telescopes will be expensive. But, NASA has done most of the work finding asteroids already. Out of all the asteroids ever found, NASA has found more than 9 out of 10 of them. Asteroids hit all over Earth, not just the USA where NASA is from. Because of this, NASA was asked by the United States government to find other countries to help. They need other countries to help make the telescopes and help pay for them.

Below is the list of all the times when asteroid impact prediction worked. When it worked, the space rocks which hit the Earth were not a surprise. There are lots of asteroids which will hit Earth in the future. They are not in the list because we don't know about any of them yet. If we get better at asteroid impact prediction we will find out about them. Then we will know what asteroids are going to hit us in the future.




International

International mostly means something (a company, language, or organization) involving more than a single country. The term international as a word means involvement of, interaction between or encompassing more than one nation, or generally beyond national boundaries. For example, international law, which is applied by more than one country and usually everywhere on Earth, and international language which is a language spoken by residents of more than one country.

The term "international" was coined by the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham in his "Introduction to Principles of Morals and Legislation", which was printed for publication in 1780 and published in 1789. Bentham wrote: "The word "international", it must be acknowledged, is a new one; though, it is hoped, sufficiently analogous and intelligible. It is calculated to express, in a more significant way, the branch of law which goes commonly under the name of the "law of nations". The word was adopted in French in 1801. Thomas Erskine Holland noted in his article on Bentham in the 11th edition of the "Encyclopædia Britannica" that "Many of Bentham's phrases, such as 'international,' 'utilitarian,' 'codification,' are valuable additions to our language; but the majority of them, especially those of Greek derivation, have taken no root in it."


"International" is also sometimes used as a synonym for "global".



Nicholas Roerich

Nicholas Roerich (; October 9, 1874 – December 13, 1947) – also known as Nikolai Konstantinovich Rerikh () – was a Russian painter, writer, archaeologist and theosophist.

His paintings are said to have hypnotic expression. He was born in Saint Petersburg to a Russian mother and a Baltic German father. Roerich was an activist for the preserving of art and architecture during war time. He earned several nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize long list. The Roerich Pact which was signed into law in 1935 by the United States and most nations of the Pan-American Union was named after him.

Plate armour

Plate armour is a type of body armour made from iron or steel plates. The iconic suit of armour that entirely covers the wearer is plate armour. The earliest example of plate armour is the Roman army's Lorica segmentata. However full plate armour was mainly made in Europe in the late middle ages. This was an improvement on the coat of plates that had been worn over chain mail in the 13th century. It reached its peak popularity in the 15th and 16th centuries. It is often associated with medieval knights, since modified plate armour was used in jousting. However after 1650 only the breastplate was generally worn. This is because the musket was created: the musket could pierce plate armour over long distances.

Ell &amp; Nikki

Ell & Nikki (also known as Eldar & Nigar) were an Azerbaijani pop duo consisting of singers Eldar Gasimov and Nigar Jamal. 

On 14 May 2011 they won the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 for Azerbaijan with their entry "Running Scared". It was the country's first (and currently only) win at the contest. 

Although Nigar Jamal represented Azerbaijan, she lives in Enfield, North London.

Both Eldar and Nigar had separately entered the selection contest for Azerbaijan's Eurovision Song Contest entry. They both won and were made into a duo under the name Ell & Nikki. As the contest was taking place in a Western European country, the name change was made to prevent confusion of Jamal's first name being interpreted as a racial slur. 

Their entry, named "Running Scared", was written by Stefan Örn and Sandra Bjurman from Sweden and Iain Farquharson from the UK. The performance included four backing vocalists and singers, including Jessica Marberger and Vera Prada who had earlier in the year attempted to represent Sweden as part of Shirley's Angels.

Following their win, Eldar was one of the presenters of the Eurovision Song Contest 2012. Both of them handed the trophy to 2012's winner Loreen. Eldar was also a judge on the Azerbaijani version of "The Voice".

In 2014, Nigar was a judge on the Azerbaijani version of "The X Factor". She lives in the United Kingdom.

Waterloo (ABBA song)

"Waterloo" is the first single from the Swedish pop group ABBA's second album, "Waterloo" and their first under the Epic and Atlantic labels. This was also the first single to be credited to the group performing under the name ABBA.

On 6 April 1974 the song was the winning entry for Sweden in the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest. The victory began ABBA's path to worldwide fame. The Swedish version of the single was a double A-side with "Honey, Honey" (Swedish version), while the English version usually featured "Watch Out" on the B-side.

The single became a No. 1 hit in several countries. It reached the U.S. Top 10 and went on to sell nearly six million copies, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time.

At the 50th anniversary celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest in 2005, it was chosen as the best song in the competition's history.

The band considered submitting another song to Eurovision, "Hasta Mañana", but decided on "Waterloo" since it gave equal weight to both lead vocalists Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, while "Hasta Mañana" was sung only by Fältskog.

ABBA performed the song at Melodifestivalen 1974 in February, singing it in Swedish. The song won, and therefore advanced to Eurovision.

The song differed from the standard "dramatic ballad" tradition of the Eurovision Song Contest by its flavour and rhythm, as well as by its performance. ABBA gave the audience something that had more rarely been seen before in Eurovision: flashy costumes (including silver platform boots), plus a catchy uptempo song and even simple choreography. The group also broke from convention by being the first winning entry in a language other than that of their home country; prior to 1973 all Eurovision singers had been required to sing in their country's native tongue, a restriction that was lifted briefly for the contests between 1973 and 1976 contests (thus allowing "Waterloo" to be sung in English), then reinstated before ultimately being removed again in 1999. Compared to later ABBA releases, the singers' Swedish accents are decidedly more pronounced in "Waterloo".

The song won the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 final on 6 April, beating runner-up Gigliola Cinquetti of Italy's entry "Sì" by six points.

Eurovision Song Contest 2007

The Eurovision Song Contest 2007 was the 52nd edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Helsinki, Finland, following Lordi's win at the 2006 contest in Athens, Greece with the song "Hard Rock Hallelujah". The contest was held at the Hartwall Areena in Helsinki, Finland from 10 May to 12 May, and staged by host broadcaster Yle.

A budget of €13 million was presented for arranging the contest. Other bids to host the contest came from Espoo, Turku and Tampere. The hosts were Finnish television personality Jaana Pelkonen and Finnish musician, stage performer and actor Mikko Leppilampi. Krisse Salminen acted as guest host in the green room, and reported from the crowds at the Senate Square.

A record number of 42 countries participated. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) put aside its limit of 40 countries, which would have meant excluding some countries using a ranking order scheme.

The winner was Serbia, appearing as an independent country for the first time.
After Lordi scored the first ever Eurovision victory with a hard rock song, several countries sent rock songs to the Contest rather than the soft pop and schlager styles more closely associated with Eurovision. This trend continued at the 2008 and 2009 Contests.

Cyprus and Latvia entered songs in languages other than their own or English. Although this happened with the Belgium 2003 entry, this was the first time the contest featured countries doing this with actual languages as opposed to an imaginary one.

Participating countries in a Eurovision Song Contest must be active members of the EBU.

42 countries submitted preliminary applications. Although in previous years the maximum number of participating countries was 40, the EBU allowed all 42 to participate in 2007. The Czech Republic, Serbia, Montenegro and Georgia all entered the contest for the first time in 2007. Monaco announced its withdrawal on 12 December 2006, and the EBU announced the final lineup of 42 countries on 15 December 2006.

Evridiki returned to represent Cyprus, having previously represented the nation in 1992 and 1994. Eiríkur Hauksson previously represented Iceland in 1986 as part of the vocal trio ICY and he previously represented Norway in 1991 as part of the group Just 4 Fun. Karolina Gočeva previously represented Macedonia in 2002. Edsilia Rombley previously represented the Netherlands in 1998.

The semi-final was held on 10 May 2007 at 21:00 (CET). 28 countries performed and all 42 participants voted.

Countries qualified for the final are highlighted.

Vaxxed

Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe is a 2016 American movie pretending that there was a cover-up by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of a possible link between the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine and autism. 

People were scared that vaccines might cause autism after an English doctor called Andrew Wakefield wrote a scientific article that said that they did. It was a fraud. When the General Medical Council found out, they took away his licence to be a doctor. The Vaxxed film was made by Andrew Wakefield.

Scientists have looked carefully at the MMR vaccine and found that it does not cause autism.

According to "Variety magazine", the film "purports to investigate the claims of a senior scientist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who revealed that the CDC had allegedly manipulated and destroyed data on an important study about autism and the MMR vaccine". This did not happen.

Fisheye lens

A fisheye lens (or fish eye lens) is a wide-angle lens, which has an very wide angle of view. Unlike normal wide angle lenses, fisheye lernses use Gnomonic projection, which will distort the image. Straight lines which do not run through the center of the image will be shown as curved ones. Common fisheye lenses have angles of view between 180 and 220 degrees. Prototypes have been built with angles of view as large as 270 and even 310 degrees. Due to their construction, conventional wide angle lenses cannot reach angles of view greater than 180 degrees. Even though they have very wide angles of view, fisheye lenses show less vignetting. Vignetting occurs when the border of the image is much darker than the center. 

Because of their wide angle of view, fisheye lenses are often used in cameras used for surveillance.

Public inquiry

A public inquiry (or tribunal of inquiry) is an official review ordered by a government body. 

It is used in many common law countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and Canada. The idea is also used in many other countries, perhaps not with the same title. It is an expression of democracy, that in some cases people and groups should be able to have their voice heard directly. The issues at stake may be of a local kind, or special to a particular group of people.

A public inquiry differs from a Royal Commission. A public inquiry accepts evidence, conducts its hearings in public and deals with a specific occurrence. Interested members of the public and organisations may make oral or written submissions, and listen to oral evidence given by other parties.

Research on the effects of public inquiries suggests they may not do much to change people's minds. However, it is normal for a public enquiry to be about some controversy. That is the point of the exercise.

Gentleman

A gentleman is an historical term used in the British class system for an educated man who is wealthy. Its significance is that in a class system, people were educated, lived and worked in quite different ways according to the circumstances of their birth. This is behind the otherwise strange divide in sports like cricket between amateur and professionals (who often played in the same side), and between Rugby Union and Rugby League.

This distinction is needed to understand many of the novels, plays, and films of the pre-WWII era. Similar distinctions ran in most other countries before the modern era. Consider the characters in Tolstoy's "War and Peace" as an example.

In 2008, The speedway was sold to Bruton Smith, hoping that the track could hold a race by 2011 and after four years, the former speedway owners abandoned the lawsuit. In August 2010, NASCAR announced that the track could hold a Cup Series event in 2011. Seven months later, Royal Dutch Shell's Quaker State brand was announced to sponsor the 267-lap race held on July 9, 2011, and was won by Kyle Busch.

"We want to see more load changes on the racetrack", NASCAR Executive Vice-President and Chief Racing Development Officer Steve O'Donnell said in a media teleconference, "We will evaluate and a number of factors coming out of Kentucky, and see what we can learn and implement down the road". Originally, the package was to be used at last year's All Star Race, but the plan was scrubbed and NASCAR opted to use the package for a points race. "Let me be clear. This is not a test, this is a race" O'Donnell said of the rules package will be in effect for the 18th round of the 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. "We had an extensive testing plan with this industry over the past 18 months. We couldn't implement this if we didn't feel confident as an industry to implement it at Kentucky.

Since 2015, the race trophy has been in the form of a Crosley jukebox.

Tim Richmond

Timothy Lee "Tim" Richmond (June 7, 1955 – August 13, 1989). was a NASCAR driver from Ashland, Ohio. He had his career cut short when he contracted HIV, and later died from complications of AIDS.

Richmond was born in Ashland, Ohio. Unlike many other NASCAR drivers,he was born into wealth and did not grow up auto racing. He did not begin racing until the age of 21, when drove a Sprint Car owned by a friend. That was when he decided to be a racing driver.

Tim Richmond was a perennial playboy. Growing up in wealth, he always appreciated the best things and was flamboyant, especially in comparison to other drivers like Dale Earnhardt, Richard Petty and Cale Yarborough. Richmond had expensive tastes in food and drink and lived a fast lifestyle that mirrored his on-track preferences.

He continued to the open-wheel circuits, racing in the 1980 Indianapolis 500 finishing ninth, He decided to move on into stock-car racing in NASCAR, where he spent the rest of his days. His first few seasons, He bounced from team to team looking for a permanent ride, which he found in 1982. He raced in 26 events, winning twice and finishing in the top 5 seven times, but finished 26th in Winston Cup standings.

At the tail end of the 1986 season, Richmond was feeling noticeably ill. Following the season, he checked into a clinic and discovered that he had AIDS. At the time, AIDS was not fully understood by doctors. Despite his illness, Richmond worked to regain his strength, finally returning in 1987 and then winning two races at Pocono and Riverside. However, his health started deteriorating and so did his results. Richmond would race in six more events before being told not to race by NASCAR. 

In 1988, Richmond tried to make another run with NASCAR. They were not only concerned about his health, but about how he contracted the disease in the first place. They subjected Richmond (and Richmond alone) to a drug test, and several days later, NASCAR announced that he was suspended indefinitely for testing positive for banned substances. Richmond was livid saying that he did not take any banned substances and demanded another test, which he passed. NASCAR later admitted that the only two substances found were Sudafed and Advil. They also released the permanent ban, but refused to allow Richmond to drive again until he surrendered his medical records that said he had AIDS.

Tim Richmond finally retired to West Palm Beach, Florida, where he lived in seclusion with his mother until his death on August 13, 1989. 

In recent years, NASCAR has suspended drivers with drug violations. Busch Series driver Shane Hmiel was suspended twice (2003 and 2005) before he was suspended for life in 2006. Kevin Grubb and Craftsman Truck Series driver Brian Rose were also suspended for failing a drug test. Many continue to point the incident with Richmond to show that an extremely "good ol' boy" system is still in place with NASCAR. 

The movie Days of Thunder was loosely based on Richmond's life, with Tom Cruise's character (Cole Trickle) inspired by Richmond. Robert Duvall's character (Harry Hogge) was inspired by crew chief Harry Hyde, and Randy Quaid's role (Tim Daland) was inspired by owner Rick Hendrick. 

Richmond was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2002.

Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod

The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS or Missouri Synod) is a Lutheran denomination in the United States. It has 2 million members. This makes it the second-largest Lutheran group in the country. The LCMS was organized in 1847 at a meeting in Chicago, Illinois. At first it was called the German Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio, and Other States ().

The LCMS has congregations in all 50 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. More than half of its members are located in the Midwest. It is a member of the International Lutheran Council. The LCMS's headquarters are in Kirkwood, Missouri.

The current president has been Matthew C. Harrison since September 1, 2010.

The Missouri Synod was started by several communities of German Lutherans in the United States. F. C. D. Wyneken did mission work in Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan. Martin Stephan started a community of Lutherans in Perry County, Missouri, and St. Louis, Missouri. Wilhelm Löhe sent missionaries to Michigan and Ohio.

In the Kingdom of Saxony in the 19th century, Lutheran pastor Martin Stephan and many of his followers thought that their church would be forced to merge with the Reformed church. Because of this, Stephan and between 600 and 700 other Saxon Lutherans left Germany to move to the United States in November 1838. They had five ships.

Their ships arrived between December 31, 1838, and January 20, 1839, in New Orleans. One ship was lost at sea. Afterwards, they settled in Perry County, Missouri. At first, Stephan was the bishop. Later, other members said that Stephan was corrupt and a fornicator, so he was kicked out. This made C. F. W. Walther the new leader.

In 1842, a German pastor named Wilhelm Löhe started sending missionaries to America. They started congregations in Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana.

In 1844 and 1845, the three groups listed above (the Saxons, the Löhe missionaries, and Wyneken) started talking about starting a synod. On April 26, 1847, twelve pastors met in Chicago, Illinois, and officially started the "German Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio and Other States". Walther was the first president.

The synod was conservative. Löhe left because he disagreed with some of its doctrine.

In 1857 and 1872, the LCMS entered into fellowship with five other conservative Lutheran synods. These groups formed the Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America.

For the thirty years after it started, the Missouri Synod focused on German-speaking Lutherans. In 1872, members of the Missouri Synod, along with three other synods, started the "English Evangelical Lutheran Conference of Missouri". This group focused on English-speakers. It became an independent synod in 1888 and merged with the LCMS in 1911.

English became more common in the LCMS during the first two decades of the 20th century. Some churched dropped all German services.

In 1947, the synod shortened its name to "The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod". In 1964, the National Evangelical Lutheran Church, an historically Finnish-American Lutheran church, merged with the LCMS. In 1971, the Synod of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, an historically Slovak-American church, merged with the LCMS.

The Synodical Conference broke up in 1963. Six years later, the LCMS formed the Lutheran Council in the United States of America (LCUSA) with several other Lutheran synods. These were moderate and liberal. Afterwards, the LCMS started becoming more conservative again.

Some of the more liberal professors and students left Concordia Seminary and started Seminex. In 1976, about 250 of the more liberal congregations left the Synod. Then the LCMS left the LCUSA.

In the early 20th century, the LCMS sent missionaries to Brazil and Argentina. The Brazil District and the Argentina District were started, which at first were part of the LCMS. In the 1980s, they became independent synods.

The LCMS had congregations in Canada. In 1988, the Canadian congregations became an independent synod, the Lutheran Church-Canada. A small number of churches in Ontario and Quebec are still in the LCMS.

The Missouri Synod believes that the Bible is the first source for the teachings of the church, and that the Bible is best explained by the Book of Concord. The Missouri Synod also teaches biblical inerrancy, which is the teaching that the Bible does not have errors.

The Missouri Synod believes that justification comes from God "by divine grace alone, through faith alone, on account of Christ alone." It teaches that faith in Jesus is the only way to eternal salvation. God gives people grace through the Word of God and the Sacraments. The synod does not have an official definition of sacrament. This means that some Missouri Synod Lutherans may disagree about how many sacraments there are. All agree that Baptism and Communion are sacraments.

In the LCMS, babies are baptized, as well as children and adults.

The LCMS teaches that the body and blood of Jesus are truly present in the Eucharist. The synod practices closed communion. This mean that normally, only confirmed members of an LCMS church (or a church that has fellowship with the LCMS) can participate in communion at an LCMS church.

The LCMS supports creationism.

LCMS pastors are usually required to have a four-year bachelor's degree (in any discipline), as well as a four-year Master of Divinity degree. The latter degree can be earned from one of these institutions: Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Concordia Theological Seminary in Fort Wayne, Indiana or at the two seminaries run by the Lutheran Church–Canada. After they receive this degree, pastors are called to a church and are ordained.

The LCMS does not let women be pastors.

The LCMS is led by a synod president, who must have been ordained. He is elected by synod members at a synodical convention. This convention is held every three years. The current president is Rev. Dr. Matthew C. Harrison.

The entire synod is divided into 35 districts, usually representing a specific geographic area. There are two non-geographic districts (the English District and the SELC District). The English District and the SELC District used to be their own synods, but they merged with the LCMS.

Each district is led by an elected district president, who must have been ordained. The districts are subdivided into circuits. Each circuit is led by a circuit visitor, who must be a pastor at one of the local churches.

The LCMS is a member of the International Lutheran Council. It also has fellowship with the American Association of Lutheran Churches (AALC).

Vinicius and Tom

Vinicius is the mascot of the 2016 Summer Olympics, and Tom is the mascot of the 2016 Summer Paralympics. The mascots represent Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Vinicius represents Brazilian animals, and his body has parts of cats, monkeys, and birds. Tom represents Brazilian plant life.

A Brazilian company called Birdo made the mascots. The Olympic organizers only wanted mascots made by Brazilian companies. The organizers chose Birdo's mascots in August 2013, and they showed them to the public on 23 November 2014, but the mascots did not have names yet at that time. The organizers asked the public to choose names for them. The public chose to name the mascots after Vinicius de Moraes and Tom Jobim. Vinicius de Moraes and Tom Jobim wrote the song "The Girl from Ipanema".

The Olympic organizers made a children's television series about the mascots. The Rio organizers also made many toys and other merchandise of the mascots. The organizers gave wrestling coaches soft dolls of Vinicius. If the coaches did not like a referee's call, then they would throw the doll into the ring. Many people thought that this was funny. Paralympic medalists got special dolls of Tom. They were special because the leaves on Tom's head were the same color as their medals. Some observers liked how the mascots looked. Others thought they looked strange.

The organizers of the 2016 Summer Olympics (Rio 2016) started to ask for mascot designs in November 2012. The events were going to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, so the Olympic organizers only wanted designs from Brazilian companies. Directors from the Brazilian film festival Anima Mundi helped the Rio 2016 organizers choose the mascots.

After looking at the designs, the Rio 2016 organizers chose three of them and asked children to help them choose the final mascot. The children were six to twelve years old and were from either Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo. The organizers gave the three designs to the children, but they did not tell the children that they were for the Olympics. The organizers only told the kids about the mascots' personalities. The children responded with comments such as "'This is my friend', 'This one seems stuck-up', 'This one has cool hair'; and 'That one looks silly'". The organizers used the children's comments to make the mascot designs better.

A group of judges chose the final mascots in August 2013. The group included members of the Rio 2016 organizers, the International Olympic Committee, the Brazilian Olympic Committee, and the Brazilian Paralympic Committee, and people who worked in animation, illustration, advertising and market research. All of the judges agreed to choose a set of two mascots, one for the Olympic Games and the other for the Paralympic Games. A São Paulo-based animation company named Birdo created these mascots. Birdo and the organizers began to create content featuring the mascots, working in secrecy.

The organizers showed the public the mascots on 23 November 2014, but they had not yet decided what to name them. On 24 November 2014, the mascots appeared publicly in costumes for the first time at the Ginásio Experimental Olímpico Juan Antonio Samaranch, a school for talented young athletes in Rio. The organizers let the public pick the names of the mascots in an online vote. There were three candidates in the vote:

The voting ended after three weeks on 14 December 2014. "Vinicius and Tom" won with 44 percent of 323,327 votes.

In the sport of wrestling, coaches may challenge a referee's call by throwing a "soft object" into the ring. This is normally a foam brick, but wrestling rules do not exactly say what the soft object must be. The Rio 2016 organizers gave wrestling coaches soft plush dolls of Vinicius to throw into the ring when they wished to challenge a call. One wrestler's coach got a Vinicius doll with a red shirt, while the opponent's coach got one with a blue shirt.

Many people thought this was funny. NBC Sports commentators started to call Vinicius "the challenge mascot". Dustin Nelson, a news writer for the website "Thrillist", wrote that the mascot took "a little of the anger out of a challenge". Jason Bryant, the official commentator for wrestling at the 2016 Olympics, was surprised to see this at the Olympics because there is a lot of emphasis on "protocol" at the Olympics. However, Byrant eventually said that it does not matter what the challenge object is if it has cultural importance to the location of the competition. Coach Mike Malinconico argued that the Olympic organizers should not have done this.

Vinicius is the Olympic mascot, and he is named after Brazilian musician Vinicius de Moraes. Vinicius's design represents Brazilian wildlife. The design combines "the agility of cats, sway of monkeys and grace of birds." Vinicius can stretch his arms and legs as long as he wants. His mission is "to spread joy throughout the world and celebrate the friendship that flourishes between people from all over the world" at the Olympic Games.

Tom is the Paralympic mascot, and is he named after Brazilian musician Tom Jobim. Tom's design represents the plants of Brazilian forests. Tom can pull any object out of his head. His mission is "to inspire everybody to use creativity and determination to always reach further and have fun."

Vinicius and Tom "were both born from the joy of Brazilians" after the International Olympic Committee chose Rio de Janeiro to host the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. The mascots are named after Vinicius de Moraes and Tom Jobim, who co-wrote the 1962 bossa nova song "The Girl from Ipanema".

On 5 August 2015, Cartoon Network Brazil started to broadcast animated short films with the mascots. The series is named "Vinicius e Tom – Divertidos por Natureza" ("Vinicius and Tom – Fun by Nature" or "Vinicius and Tom – Natural Entertainers"). The series has 32 episodes. Each episode is two minutes long. "Divertidos por Natureza" is the third television cartoon series based on Olympic mascots. It is also the first cartoon created in the Americas based on Olympic mascots. The show follows Vinicius and Tom as they live in Brazilian forests and cities. The mascots are also sometimes joined by the "Carioca Sisters" (). The sisters are named Bela, Sol, and Vida.

The series is designed to promote the mascots. Turner Broadcasting System, the owner of Cartoon Network, spent US$750,000 to develop the series. Cartoon Network helped to coproduce the series because it won a competition held by the Rio 2016 organizers to select a collaborator for the series. Brand director Beth Lula said that the mascots "are one of the principal methods of engaging the public with the Games. The cartoon will give them life, reinforcing the emotional link of the public with the event." The series is targeted towards children, but the show's staff said that adults will like it too too.

The mascots were included among the merchandise of the Rio 2016 Games. Merchandise items ranged in size from a Lego kit to life-size dolls. The organizers gave Paralympic medalists stuffed toys of Tom. They colored the leaves on the dolls' heads in gold, silver, or bronze in order to match with their medals. The Vinicius and Tom Lego kit is the first time that Lego made a commercial version of Olympic mascots. An employee at a Rio 2016 merchandise store said that the mascots were "the most popular thing by far. ... Kids and adults all love them, especially Vinicius, he is the favourite."

The Rio 2016 Organizing Committee thought that the mascots could make up a quarter of merchandise sales in Rio. Overall, merchandise sales were 11 percent higher than what they thought, according to Rio 2016 spokesperson Mario Andrada. The best-selling item was a hat in the shape of Vinicius's head. The second-best-selling item was a pair of Havaianas with a drawing of Vinicius on it.

Julia Glum wrote about Vinicius and Tom in an article in the "International Business Times." She said that the "mascot for the Olympic Games is almost always strange-looking, and Rio de Janeiro is no exception. ... though they're by far not the craziest Olympic animals to ever exist ..." In an article published by "Mic", Brianna Provenzano called the mascots "lovable". She described their appearance as "sweet and simple", and she highlighted their symbolisms for the animals and plants of Brazil. On the other hand, Charlotte Wilder wrote an article in "USA Today"s sports column "For The Win." She said that she was unimpressed by Vinicius's design: "Whoever was in charge of coming up with this creature of the huge hands and feet did exactly what it looks like, which is mash up a bunch of animals, video game characters, and cartoons, stuff it with some synthetic filling, and call it day." Robert John Young, Professor of Wildlife Conservation at the University of Salford, thought that Rio 2016 should have given more attention to environmental protection by using actual animal species instead of inventing their own animal. Young also thought that the organizers should have included a female name in the public vote.
Carlos Merigo wrote on Brazilian website "B9" that the mascots bring back "the colorful, loving and fun atmosphere that marked the Olympic mascots over the decades". Merigo called them a "return to origins" following the "shapelessness" of Wenlock and Mandeville, the mascots of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Neha Prakash wrote an article on digital media website "Mashable". Prakash said that Vinicius and Tom "are more nostalgia-inducing than nightmarish" compared to the "terror" of the mascots of the 2014 Winter Olympics. Many people compared the art style of the mascots to that of the "Pokémon" franchise. Stephen Wood wrote an article on the history of Olympic mascots in "Paste", and he compared them to the style of "Adventure Time", an American animated television series. In an article published on "Slate"'s culture blog "Brow Beat", Matthew Dessem wrote that there were no big problems with the mascots when compared to previous Olympic mascots: "Like the best Olympic mascots of yore, Vinicius and Tom are well-suited to plush toys and licensing deals and will be completely forgotten within a year."

National Museum of Brazil

The National Museum of Brazil () is the oldest museum and scientific institution of Brazil, located in Rio de Janeiro. It was established on 6 June 1818. Until 2018, it had one of the largest collections of natural history and anthropology in the Americas. Despite this, the 200 year old museum was already in bad condition when it burned on 2 September 2018.

From 2014 the museum had budget cuts that dropped its maintenance to less than R$520,000 annually. The budget was so low, there was $0.01 to spend on each of the artifacts.

The building fell into disrepair, with peeling wall material, exposed electrical wiring, and a termite problem. Some of the artifacts lost in the fire included Egyptian mummies, remains from the oldest human skeleton found in the Americas, frescoes from Pompeii, and dinosaur skeletons.

By June 2018, the museum's 200th anniversary, it had reached a state of near-complete abandonment.

There was an offer from The World Bank to buy the museum for $80m. It was turned down because the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro would have to give up ownership.

On 2 September 2018, at around 19:30 local time, a large fire broke out at the Paço de São Cristóvão. The museum was almost completely destroyed. The museum's holdings included over 20 million items. About 90% were destroyed.

Brazil's President Michel Temer called the loss of the historical and cultural heritage "incalculable". The cause of the fire is not known, but many connected it to the museum's lack of funding.

No injuries were reported.

St John Ambulance is run by its founders, the Venerable Order of Saint John. The Order is a descendant of the Knights Hospitaller of the Middle Ages. They founded the first branch of St John Ambulance in the United Kingdom in the 19th century. In 1877, the St John Ambulance Association was set up to teach first aid skills. In 1887, the St John Ambulance Brigade was founded to provide first aid at local events. These two have since been merged into the English branch of St John Ambulance.

Gambia River

The Gambia River (formerly known as the River Gambra) is a major river in West Africa. It is about long. It runs from the Fouta Djallon plateau in north Guinea westward through Senegal and the Gambia to the Atlantic Ocean at the city of Banjul. It is navigable for about half that length.

The river is strongly associated with The Gambia, the smallest country in mainland Africa, which consists of little more than the downstream half of the river and its two banks.

From the Fouta Djallon, the river runs northwest into the Tambacounda Region of Senegal, where it flows through the Parc National du Niokolo Koba, then is joined by the Nieri Ko and Koulountou before entering the Gambia at Fatoto. At this point the river runs generally west, but in a meandering course with a number of oxbows, and about 100km from its mouth it gradually widens, to over 10km wide where it meets the sea.

Near the mouth of the river, near Juffure, is Kunta Kinteh Island, a place used in the slave trade which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The aquatic fauna in the Gambia River basin is closely associated with that of the Senegal River basin, and the two are usually combined under a single ecoregion known as the Senegal-Gambia Catchments. Although the species richness is moderately high, only three species of frogs and one fish are endemic to this ecoregion.

Oysters are harvested from the River Gambia and used to make oyster stew, a traditional dish in the cuisine of Gambia.

The river is an important trade route. Ocean-going vessels can use it for , to the settlement of Kuntaur. Smaller ships can reach the settlement Fatoto, which is from its mouth. 

Tongyong Pinyin

Tongyong Pinyin is a romanization of Mandarin Chinese, or a way to write Mandarin in the Roman alphabet, that was invented in Taiwan. It was created by the Taiwanese to oppose Hanyu Pinyin, which is the official romanization of Mandarin in Mainland China, the UN, and most other international organizations, because many Taiwanese do not want to use a writing system created by the Chinese Communist Party. In 2002, it became the official romanization in Taiwan, even though no one was forced to use it. However, in 2009, Taiwan replaced Tongyong with Hanyu as the island's official romanization. While Taipei mostly uses Hanyu spelling today, many cities, particularly in southern Taiwan, still use many different romanizations, including Tongyong spelling, and it can still be seen in many places.

Most Tongyong spellings of Chinese syllables are the same as Hanyu spellings. However, one major difference is that Tongyong does not use letters 'x' and 'q', which are both used in Hanyu. Below is a chart that compares syllables in Hanyu to those in Tongyong. Below is not an exhaustive list, but a list that show major differences between the two systems.

Below are examples of sentences written in Chinese characters, Hanyu Pinyin, and Tongyong Pinyin with English translations.

The Tamam Shud case, also known as the Mystery of the Somerton Man, is an unsolved case of an unidentified man found dead at 6:30 am, 1 December 1948, on Somerton beach, Glenelg, just south of Adelaide, South Australia.

It is named after the Persian phrase "tamám shud", meaning "ended" or "finished", printed on a scrap of paper found months later in the fob pocket of the man's trousers. 

The scrap had been torn from the final page of a copy of "Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam", authored by 12th-century poet Omar Khayyám. "Tamam" was misspelt as "Taman" in many early reports and this error.

Jessica Thomson living in nearby Glenelg was questioned in connection with the case, her phone number was found in the book. Shortly afterwards, she gave birth to a boy with the same rare ear trait as the unidentified man.

On 26 July 2022, a professor Derek Abbott with genealogist Colleen M. Fitzpatrick, claimed to have identified the man as Carl "Charles" Webb, born in 1905, based on DNA of the man's hair. South Australia Police and Forensic Science South Australia have not verified the result, but said they were "cautiously optimistic" about it.

Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum theft

On March 18, 1990, 13 paintings worth for a total of $500 million were stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. In the early hours, guards admitted two men posing as police officers responding to a disturbance call.

Once inside, the thieves tied up the guards and over the next hour committed the largest-value recorded theft of private property in history. Despite efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and multiple probes around the world, no arrests have been made and no works have been recovered.

The museum initially offered a reward of $5 million for information leading to the art's recovery, but in 2017 this was temporarily doubled to $10 million, with an expiration date set to the end of the year. This was extended into 2018 following helpful tips from the public.

It was announced on 29 November that the secret gang behind the heist have been arrested with the help of the family of them. Unfortunately only 5 paintings was recovered, the rest still remain hidden. Those 5 are The concert, A lady and Gentlemen in Black, Landscape with obelisk, Chez Tortoni and Three mounted Jockeys.

Isdal Woman

The Isdal Woman () is the name given to an unknown woman who was found dead at Isdalen Valley in Bergen, Norway, on 29 November 1970. It is thought to be one of Norway's most profound mysteries. The case has been the subject of intense speculation for many years.

The official cause of death was a combination of carbon monoxide poisoning and barbiturate overdose.

There are many theories as to who the Isdal Woman was ranging from secret spy to a suicidal woman.

Killing of Osama bin Laden

Osama bin Laden, the founder and first leader of the Islamist group Al-Qaeda, was killed in Pakistan on May 2, 2011 shortly after 1:00 am PKT (20:00 UTC, May 1) by United States Navy SEALs of the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group (also known as DEVGRU or SEAL Team Six).

The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was carried out in a CIA-led operation with Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). The operation ended a nearly 10-year search for bin Laden, following his role in the September 11 attacks on the United States.

The raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan was launched from Afghanistan. U.S. military officials said that after the raid U.S. forces took bin Laden's body to Afghanistan for identification, then buried him at sea within 24 hours of his death in accordance with Islamic tradition.

The SEALs encountered the residents in the compound's guest house, in its main building on the first floor where two adult males lived, and on the second and third floors where bin Laden lived with his family.

The second and third floors were the last section of the compound to be cleared. There were reportedly "small knots of children ... on every level, including the balcony of bin Laden's room".

bin Laden was killed in the raid and initial versions said three other men and a woman were killed as well: bin Laden's adult son Khalid, bin Laden's courier Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, al-Kuwaiti's brother Abrar, and Abrar's wife Bushra.

Al-Qaeda confirmed the death on May 6 with posts made on militant websites, vowing to avenge the killing.

The raid was supported by over 90% of the American public, United Nations, NATO, the European Union, along with a large number of governments, but was criticized by two-thirds of the Pakistani public.

Also controversial was the decision not to release any photographic or DNA evidence of bin Laden's death to the public.

In the aftermath of the killing, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani created a commission under Senior Justice Javed Iqbal. The resulting Abbottabad Commission Report, which revealed Pakistani state military and intelligence authorities’ “collective failure” that enabled bin Laden to hide in Pakistan for nine years.


Disappearance of Bobby Dunbar

Bobby Dunbar was an American boy whose disappearance at the age of four and apparent return was widely reported in newspapers across the United States in 1912 and 1913. 

In August 1912, the Dunbars took a fishing trip to nearby Swayze Lake in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana. On that trip, Bobby Dunbar disappeared, on August 23.

After an eight-month nationwide search, investigators believed that they had found the child in Mississippi, in the hands of William Cantwell Walters of North Carolina. 

Dunbar's parents claimed the boy as their missing son. However, both Walters and a woman named Julia Anderson said that the boy with him was Anderson's son. Julia Anderson could not afford a lawyer, and the court eventually sided for the Dunbars. Percy and Lessie Dunbar retained custody of the child, who spent the rest of his life as Bobby Dunbar.

In 2004, DNA test found that the boy found with Walters and "returned" to the Dunbars as Bobby had not been a blood relative of the Dunbar family. Since the DNA testing is conclusive, the fate of the actual Bobby Dunbar remains unsolved.

Operation Eagle Claw

Operation Eagle Claw, known as Operation Tabas () in Iran, was a United States Armed Forces operation ordered by U.S. President Jimmy Carter to try to end the Iran hostage crisis by rescuing 52 embassy staff held captive at the Embassy of the United States, Tehran on 24 April 1980. 

Its failure damaged U.S. prestige worldwide. Carter himself blamed his loss in the 1980 U.S. presidential election mainly on his failure to win the release of the hostages.

Gwoyeu Romatzyh

Gwoyeu Romatzyh (pinyin: "Guóyǔ luómǎzì", literally "National Language Romanization"), abbreviated GR, is a romanization of Mandarin Chinese, or a way to write Mandarin using the Roman alphabet, made by Yuen Ren Chao and some other linguists in the late 1920s. It was made as a way to write Mandarin using tonal spelling, or spelling rules that would change the syllable's spelling depending on its tone. For example, the syllable "chai" would be written as "chai" if it has the first Mandarin tone (or "chāi" in Pinyin), "chair" if it has the second tone ("chái")", chae" if it has the third tone ("chǎi")"," and "chay" if it had the fourth tone (chài). Y.R. Chao created GR in order to increase literacy in China because China's illiteracy was very high in the early 20th century. He made it that tones could be written without extra tone markers, which can be long and difficult to add when printing. 

Even though many other Asian languages use tonal spelling, like Hmong, they all represent tones by using the same letter each time the tone is used. In Hmong, for example, "-b is always" a high tone, "-s" is always a low tone, "-j" is always high-falling tone. In GR, however, each syllable final has its own spelling rules, and many exceptions exist within these rules. For example, first tone words with the final "-a" as in "bā" is written with just one vowel like "ba", except when the syllable begins with an "l-, m-," or "n-", which then must be written as "lha, mha," and "nha" respectively. This is only one of its many rules and exceptions. 

Unsurprisingly, many people thought GR was too difficult to learn. Nonetheless, it still has many supporters, and they would rather learn using GR than Pinyin. While supporters of GR claim that it helps users of GR remember tones better than people who just use Pinyin, studies have not supported this claim. As a matter of fact, one study showed that after one year, the subjects who learned Chinese using Pinyin could more accurately speak Mandarin with tones than those who learned using GR. 

After the Communist Party took over China, it tried to replaced all romanizations of Chinese, including GR, with Pinyin. While GR is not an official romanization in Taiwan, it can be seen in several places, including road signs, people's names, and the names of products, even though Hanyu Pinyin is the official romanization of Taiwan. 

Even though almost all romanizations in mainland China today are in Pinyin, there are still some exceptions. For example, the name of the province Shaanxi is written in GR rather than in Pinyin, which would be Shǎnxī with tone markers, because there is already another province named Shanxi, which is written as Shānxī with tones. If the Pinyin names were to be written without tone markers (which they often are in everyday Pinyin), they should both be spelled Shanxi. Therefore they would be impossible to tell apart using just Pinyin without tones. Therefore, an exception has been made in this case. 

Below are examples of sentences written in Chinese characters, GR, and Pinyin with English translations. 

Arch of Septimus Severus

The Arch of Septimius Severus () is at the northwest end of the Roman Forum. It is a white marble triumphal arch. It was dedicated in 203 AD after the Parthian victories of Emperor Septimius Severus and his two sons. Two campaigns were fought against the Parthians in 194/195 and 197–199 AD.

The sons were Caracalla and Geta. After the death of Septimius Severus, his sons were initially joint emperors. Caracalla had Geta assassinated in 212; Geta's memorials were destroyed. All images or mentions of him were removed from public buildings and monuments. So, Geta's image and inscriptions were removed from the arch (damnatio memoriae).

Flags of cities of the United States

The flags of the cities of the United States exhibit a wide variety of regional influences and local histories, as well as widely different styles and design principles.

Many flags of Floridian cities feature their city seal on a saltire, incorporating elements from the Floridian flag, itself based on the former Spanish flag, into their designs.
Some city flags of New York, such as that of Albany and New York, feature colors from the Dutch Prince's Flag in their designs, due to the prominence of the Netherlands in the history of New York.

The company handles distribution rights to acquired series, mini-series, and made-for-TV films from the Paramount Television libraries (such as those of Desilu Productions, Paramount Television, Viacom Productions and Enterprises, Republic Pictures Television, Big Ticket Entertainment, Spelling Television, and Worldvision Enterprises), and series, mini-series, and made-for-TV films from the CBS television libraries (such as those by CBS Productions, King World Productions, the majority of those by Group W Productions, and its own first-run broadcast syndication and off-network television series). CBS also handles the TV rights to much of its own theatrical films. The company formerly distributed the film libraries from Paramount Pictures and Republic Pictures, among others. The company is also responsible for international television distribution rights to series by Rysher Entertainment including certain HBO series through its CBS Studios International division.

This would mark the sixth distribution name for CBS as CBS Television Film Sales was the first (1952–1958), CBS Films, Inc. was the second (1958–1967), CBS Enterprises was the third (1968–1971), Eyemark Entertainment was the fourth (1995–2000), and CBS Paramount Domestic Television was the fifth (2006–2012).

From 2006 to 2008, CTD distributed the DreamWorks Television and DreamWorks Pictures libraries in conjunction with Tribune Entertainment, after Viacom's acquisition of DreamWorks in February 2006, but before the studio was spun off. These distribution rights are now held by Disney-ABC Domestic Television (for live-action TV series and post-9/2005 live-action films) and Trifecta Entertainment & Media (for earlier live-action films and all animated productions).

Until May 2009, CTD distributed the Paramount Pictures library on television. By then, CBS also dropped the name "Paramount" from television for good, renaming CBS Paramount Television to CBS Television Studios. Paramount has also joined up with Trifecta. However, CTD continues to distribute films currently copyrighted by CBS (or a subdivision thereof), including those films from Cinema Center Films and CBS Theatrical Films, along with a few select entries to which CBS bought ancillary rights in later years, such as "My Fair Lady".

The current moniker for CTD's overseas distribution arm is CBS Studios International (since 2009). Its predecessors were CBS Broadcast International and CBS Paramount International Television.

Vladimir Guerrero

Vladimir Alvino Guerrero (born February 9, 1975), nicknamed Vlad, Vlady and Vlad the Impaler, is a Dominican former professional baseball player who spent 16 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a right fielder and designated hitter. He played for the Montreal Expos (1996–2003), Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (2004–09), Texas Rangers (2010), and Baltimore Orioles (2011).

Guerrero is considered one of the greatest batters of all time, and is widely regarded as the best "bad ball" batter of all time (the ability to hit pitches outside of the strike zone). He was well known for putting the ball into play, and particularly on the first pitch. He had exceptional hands at the plate, and would bat without batting gloves. Guerrero was able to hit for both power and average. In the outfield, Guerrero was sometimes considered a defensive liability, prone to making errors, which resulted in him being a designated hitter in the last stage of his remarkable career, but he was also known to have a very powerful throwing arm that allowed him to make outfield assists on base runners.

Many baseball fans and critics believe Guerrero's career was overshadowed by those of other players due to playing for a small fan base in Montreal, and similarly, many believe that he deserved to win the 2000 National League Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award for his remarkable season, an award which instead was won by Barry Bonds.

Guerrero barely missed being elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on the first ballot (first year of candidacy), but he was admitted in on the second ballot.

One of Guerrero's sons, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., plays in MLB.

Hyperaccumulator

A hyperaccumulator is a plant that can grow in soils with very high concentrations of metals.

Featured by the BBC is a tree on the island of New Caledonia, "Pycnandra acuminata", which grows on soil rich in nickel. Many different plants do this in several different plant families.

The advantage of hyperaccumulation of metals may be that the toxic levels of heavy metals in leaves deter herbivores (defence against herbivory).

Several gene families are involved in hyperaccumulation including absorbing and storing heavy metals. The genes most usually involved are the ZIP gene family. These genes code for membrane receptors for the transport of, for example, zinc molecules.

These hyperaccumulation genes (HA genes) are found in over 450 plant species, including the model organisms "Arabidopsis" and the Brassicaceae. Expression of HA genes allows the plant to uptake and sequester metals such as As, Co, Fe, Cu, Cd, Pb, Hg, Se, Mn, Zn, Mo and Ni in 100–1000 times the concentration found in sister species or populations.


Subroutine

In computer programming, a subroutine is a code that is comprised of more codes — just like everything in programming — its purpose is the same: execute an instruction/command. Because subroutines are shorter, they can be typed faster and therefore be used more by programmers, hence saving time by being able to code faster.

Subroutines are commonly paired with parameter, a type of variable.

SDP-Liberal Alliance

The S.D.P-Liberal Alliance was an alliance between the Social Democratic Party (S.D.P) and the Liberal Party. The two British political parties promised to help each other in order to try to win the 1983 and 1987 UK general elections. The alliance won around a quarter of the vote each time. In 1988, the two parties decided to join together to form the Liberal Democrats.

Presbyterian Church in Ireland

The Presbyterian Church in Ireland is the largest Presbyterian church in Ireland and the biggest Protestant denomination in Northern Ireland. It has over 225,000 members, represented by over 500 congregations.

Fear: Trump in the White House

Fear: Trump in the White House is a book by American Watergate journalist Bob Woodward. The book explains the operations in the Trump White House and quotes important members of the administration including John F. Kelly as "hiding key information from the president in order that he doesn't make impulsive decisions". It also says United States Secretary of Defense James Mattis called the president a "fifth or fourth grader". 

On the 5th of September 2018, President Donald Trump called the book "a con on the public" and said that it had untrue information. White House Chief of Staff also released a statement saying "he is committed to the president".

When the book was leaked by the Washington Post, White House Chief of staff John F. Kelly released a statement saying he "never called the president an idiot".

Student council

A student council is an organization made by students.
The heads of the student council are mostly two pupils who are contact persons for the principal, teachers, students and parents. They represent the interests of all pupils and are in contact with the principal (monthly conversations). Also, they tell teachers about the students’ requests and complaints and try to solve problems. The head of the student council is automatically a member of the student council and convenes their meetings. They are also the leader of these meetings. The head of the student council is responsible for the spreading of information and they have to put the decisions of the student council into practice. But they can also put their own ideas, which they have suggested in their election program, into reality.

They student council has to show an interest in the opinions and the suggestions pupils have for the improvement of the school.

This means that the student representatives work for the interests of the students and bring them to the school management. Specifically, the student representatives have a right to be heard by the school management if the pupils have any concerns. These concerns may include suggestions for improvement in classroom teaching, conflicts with the teaching staff or organizational issues, or any other concerns. The student representatives should take care that not every issue has to be reported directly to the school management. Many problems can also be solved by talking directly to the participants.

Another important task of the student representation is to form working groups and to take over the planning of school projects. For example, if student representatives decide to collect money for an improvement at school, they may set up a committee to organize a sponsorship run or a charity concert.

Every student council has a head with mostly two pupils. Every year pupils can volunteer to stand for election. They have to present their election program. In the election program the candidates present their goals for the school year to the other pupils. All pupils take part in the election and elect the new head of the student council.

The other part of the student council are the class speakers. They are elected by their class mates. All class speakers are automatically in the student council.

Germany:

In German schools the student council represents the students and their ideas and wishes.

They plan school events and their election is a must.

Norway:                        

All schools in Norway have to have a student council by law.

The purpose of the student council is to improve their school by encouraging social and cultural events and also events outside of school. The student councils are governed by a management which is either elected directly or by the student council.

Ireland:

Since 1998 in Ireland there has been constant evolution of student councils in primary schools. Schools and staff assist the creation of the student council.

Finland:

Secondary high schools and vocational schools in Finland have student councils. They include all the students of the institution, but their status is not very important. The act demands that they should be heard in all matters connected to the education in the institution, but this is often not done.

Spain:

Most Spanish universities have student councils which are regulated by law, however schools don’t have any. Some of the basic points are the 24% of student representation in the board. The council is elected by universal assent of the students.

United Kingdom:

In Wales a student council, often called different names, is required in every kind of school. The Council has to meet regularly. The head of the students is elected by the students.

Rhetorical Triangle

The Rhetorical Triangle represents the three rhetorical appeals created by Aristotle. The Greek terms "pathos", "logos", and "ethos" compose the triangle. "Pathos" means appealing to emotions; "ethos" means appealing to ethics; "logos" means logic. The balance of these terms creates a powerful way to convey a message in any communication style.

This is ethos because it refers to reputable sources.

This is pathos because it appeals to emotions of readers. 

This is an example of logos because it offers statistics to support a claim.

Business writing

Business writing is a form of professional communication that typically consists of memorandums, emails, letters, and other documents. Usually found within a work environment, business writing helps employees communicate efficiently. Business writing is also used for communication with outside sources such as other companies or customers. The goal of business writing is to clearly define to your audience what you are trying to portray.

Based on what kind of audience you are writing to, (boss, coworkers, customers, other companies) certain formats will be expected. Your audience also dictates the content of the document and its tone. In most cases, a professional tone is expected although in some instances, such as with coworkers a more casual tone can be used.

Doxing

Doxing is the process of finding or uncovering personal information about a person, group, organization or corporate entity. This information is collected for the purpose of publishing it online. The result of doxing is called a dox. Doxing is usually done with the intent to harm someone. Typically, a person is doxed for revenge-based reasons, motivating the person who is wronged or who has perceived a wrong to humiliate and expose their target. Doxing us illegal in many countries .

Doxing was originally started back in the 1980s to 1990s, by black-hat hackers and penetration testers of the time. They used it to silence and/or intimate their hacker rivals in the BBS and internet communities. Doxing is a form of vigilantism and many instances of doxing have led to swatting, years of harassment, people having to move out of their homes and change their phone numbers. Being doxed will also make you more vulnerable to identity theft. In the present day, specifically in the United States, doxing is used as a method of political dissent and political attack, primarily by left-leaning people against those with Conservative leanings. Doxing as well as deplatforming have become an integral part of "Cancel Culture."

Affricate

Affricates are consonants that are said with a stop with a fricative immediately afterwards. For example, the 'ch' sound in English (written as /t͡ʃ/ in IPA) is said with an 't' (/t/) sound with an 'sh' (/ʃ/) sound immediately afterwards. Both voiced and voiceless affricates exist; in English, they are /d͡ʒ/ (the 'j' sound) and /t͡ʃ/ (the 'ch' sound) respectively. 

In Mandarin Chinese, affricates are told apart by aspiration, or breathiness, since voiced affricates do not exist; aspirated affricates, or breathy affricates, are /t͡ɕʰ/ (written as 'q' in Hanyu Pinyin), /t͡sʰ/ ('c'), and /ʈ͡ʂʰ/ ('ch'), and unaspirated affricates, or non-breathy affricates, are /t͡ɕ/ ('j'), /t͡s/ ('z'), and /ʈ͡ʂ/ ('zh').

Aspiration

Aspiration is a feature in languages where saying a consonant gives out a puff of air. For example, if you dangle a piece of paper in front of your mouth, you will see it move if you say an aspirated, or breathy, consonant. If the paper does not move, then it is unaspirated, or not breathy. In English, voiceless stops and fricatives that happen at the beginning of a word are aspirated, which are the sounds 'p', 't', 'k', and 'ch' (which are written as /p/, /t/, /k/, /t͡ʃ/ in IPA in the same order). In IPA, aspirated sounds can be written with an ʰ symbol afterwards, as in /pʰ/, /tʰ/, /kʰ/, and /t͡ʃʰ/. For example, the first sound in the words "pick", "tick", "kick", and "chick" are all aspirated. In IPA, they are written as /pʰɪk/, /tʰɪk/, /kʰɪk/, and /t͡ʃʰɪk/ in the same order. However, voiceless stops and fricatives that appear after the first sound are unaspirated. For example, while the /p/ in "pit" is aspirated, the /p/ in "spit" and the /p/ in "tip" are not, so they would not be marked with an ʰ symbol afterwards. Below are more examples of aspiration.
English has no aspirated voiced sounds, but Hindi does. They are normally written with an 'h' after the consonant letter. An example of this is the name Bhattacharya, in which 'bh' is an aspirated 'b' sound, so it would be written as /bʱ/ in IPA.

In Mandarin Chinese, there are no voiced stops, fricatives, or affricates, so the only way to tell them apart is by aspiration. In Pinyin, aspirated sounds are written like voiceless sounds in English, so the sounds /pʰ/, /tʰ/, and /kʰ/ are written as 'p', 't', and 'k' in the same order, but unaspirated sounds are written like voiced sounds in English, so the sounds /p/, /t/, and /k/ are written as 'b', 'd', and 'g' respectively. For example, the word "Gaokao" would be written in IPA as /kau̯.kʰau̯/. In Wade-Giles spelling, aspirated stops, fricatives, or affricates are written with an apostrophe after the letter instead of using a different letter like in Pinyin, so "Gaokao" would be written as "Kaok'ao" in Wade-Giles.

National Higher Education Entrance Examination

The National Higher Education Entrance Examination, or the Gaokao, is the People's Republic of China's national-level university entrance exam. All high school students in China must take the Gaokao in their last year of school, and much of their time in high school is spent preparing to take the exam. Like many other Asian countries, such as Japan, South Korea, and India, the Gaokao has been well-known internationally for being a very difficult exam because many students do not get a high enough score to attend university in China.

The required subjects are mathematics, Chinese and English, and the full score of each three subjects is 150 points. For the remaining subjects, there are two choices: the liberal arts comprehensive are history, geography and politics, with a score of 100 for each subject; The science subjects include physics, chemistry and biology, with 100 points for each subject. Students are allowed to choose between science and liberal arts based on their level of study, and each student scored a maximum of 750. Although two kinds of choice means brought the power that examinee learns, but in China, the obtain employment of liberal arts living is more difficult than science living, the score of the university entrance exam also is lower than science living, so the examinee that chooses science department is much more than the examinee that chooses liberal arts.

In the national college entrance examination in June 2018, 9.75 million people took the exam, which shows the great pressure of competition. It is a pity that many people are ruined on their way to university just because of one failure in the exam. One of the disadvantages of Chinese education is that it only takes one exam to select talents. However, because there are too many references, the nation can only select talents through examinations. Facts have proved that this selection method still has some merits.

Law of the Minimum

The Law of the minimum, also called Liebig's law of the minimum, is a law about the growth of plants. It states that the growth of a plant is limited by the resource which is most scarce, and not by the total amount of resources available. The law has also been used to predict the growth of populations.

Wassily Leontief (1905-1999) formulated a similar rule for economics: It is known as Leontief production function today.

Dobenecks used the image of a barrel — often called "Liebig's barrel" — to explain Liebig's law. In a barrel, with staves of unequal length, the capacity of the barrel is determined by the shortest stave. This is also true for the growth of a plant: it is limited by the nutrient in shortest supply.

If a system satisfies the law of the minimum then adaptation will equalize the load of different factors because the adaptation resource will be allocated for compensation of limitation. Adaptation systems act as the cooper of Liebig's barrel and lengthens the shortest stave to improve barrel capacity. Indeed, in well-adapted systems the limiting factor should be compensated as far as possible. This observation follows the concept of resource competition and fitness maximization.

Due to the law of the minimum paradoxes, if we observe the Law of the Minimum in artificial systems, then under natural conditions adaptation will equalize the load of different factors and we can expect a violation of the law of the minimum. Inversely, if artificial systems demonstrate significant violation of the law of the minimum, then we can expect that under natural conditions adaptation will compensate this violation. In a limited system life will adjust as an evolution of what came before.

Crystal field theory

Crystal Field Theory (CFT) is a scientific representation of how metals behave when dissolved in water to form a special type of chemical called a complex. This model may be used to predict the colors of certain metal containing chemicals when dissolved in water, as well as their reactions when placed near a magnet. It may also be use to predict the shape of the chemicals. CFT does not predict the connections between atoms. CFT was created by physicists Hans Bethe and John Hasbrouck van Vleck in 1930. It was later combined with the molecular orbital theory to create the ligand field theory, which does describe the connections between atoms.

Oganesson

Oganesson is a synthetic chemical element with symbol Og and atomic number 118. Oganesson has the highest atomic number and highest atomic mass of all known elements. The radioactive oganesson atom is very unstable, and since 2005, only five (possibly six) atoms of the isotope Oganesson-294 have been created.

The element is named in honor of Yuri Oganessian. It was first created in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia by a joint team of Russian and American scientists. In December 2015, it was recognized as one of four new elements by the Joint Working Party of the international scientific people at IUPAC and IUPAP. It was formally named on 28 November 2016. It had a previous name given by the IUPAC called "Ununoctium" meaning "one-one-eight" in Latin. This was a placeholder name until the element was discovered and a name was given. The possibility of a seventh noble gas, after helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon, was considered almost as soon as the noble gas group was discovered. Danish chemist Hans Peter Jørgen Julius Thomsen predicted in April 1895, the year after the discovery of argon, that there was a whole group of chemically unreactive gases similar to argon that would link the halogen and alkali metal groups. He expected that the seventh of this series would end a 32-element period which contained elements like thorium and uranium and have an atomic weight of 292, close to the 294 now known for the first and only confirmed isotope of oganesson.

The chemistry of Oganesson cannot be found because of how radioactive it is and how short its half-life is, which is only 0.69 milliseconds. However, predictions can be made based on properties the group has in common with each other. Since it's a noble gas, it is predicted that it will be a diatomic molecule (it only pairs with itself).

It currently has no uses due to how radioactive and how short its half-life is.

Eunice aphroditois

Eunice aphroditois, also known as the bobbit worm (or bobbitt worm) or sand striker, is an ambush predator of the sea floor. It is a polychaete worm dwelling in a burrow on the ocean floor. It buries its long body into the ocean bed of gravel, mud, or corals. It waves a few feelers (antennae) as a kind of lure.

When it feels a stimulus to one of its feelers, it attacks if it senses prey. Armed with sharp pincers, it attacks with such speed and ferocity that its prey is sometimes sliced in half. Usually, it drags the prey down into its burrow, and eats it there.

The procedure is well captured on YouTube, where the worm goes by the name of bobbit worm.

Zenani Mandela-Dlamini

Princess Zenani Mandela-Dlamini (born 4 February 1959) is a South African diplomat. She is the elder daughter of Nelson Mandela and his second wife, Winnie Mandela.

They married in 1973 and had four children – Zaziwe (born 1977), Zamaswazi (1979), Zinhle (1980) and Zozuko (1992) – but are currently separated. They are co-owners of Mandela, Dlamini and Associates (International Business Consultants).
She was appointed ambassador for South Africa to Argentina in July 2012. She was the first of Mandela's children to enter public service. She served in this position until 2017, when she was appointed South African high commissioner to Mauritius.

After Mandela was elected president and his divorce to Winnie, Zenani accompanied her father to his inauguration. She become the stand-in First Lady of South Africa until her father remarried.

High Plains (United States)

The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. They are the western part of the Great Plains before the region reaches the Rocky Mountains.

The High Plains are in southeastern Wyoming, southwestern South Dakota, western Nebraska, eastern Colorado, western Kansas, eastern New Mexico, western Oklahoma, and south of the Texas Panhandle. They are mostly in the Western United States, but also partly in the Midwest states of Nebraska, Kansas, and South Dakota.

Geologically, the high plains are caused by the same process as caused the Rockies. The cause is the westward movement of North America away from Eurasia, which has been going on for over 100 million years. As the continent moved west, it subducted plates under the western side, and stretched out its eastern side. This explains why the western states all have some mountainous terrain, and the eastern states in the south are so low-lying.

From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around to over . The High Plains has a "cold semi-arid" climate—Köppen "BSk"—they get between of precipitation annually.

Due to low moisture and high elevation, the High Plains get extremes of temperature. The temperature range from day to night is usually , and 24-hour temperature shifts of are possible.

In Browning, Montana from January 23, 1916 to January 24, 1916, the temperature fell from . This is the world record for the greatest temperature change in 24 hours. The region is known for the steady, and sometimes intense, winds that come from the west. These add a considerable wind chill factor in the winter. The development of wind farms in the High Plains is one of the latest areas of economic development.

The High Plains has one of the lowest population densities of any region in the continental United States; Wyoming, for example, has the second lowest population density in the country after Alaska.

Koch's postulates

Koch's postulates are four ideas about the relationship between a microbe and a disease. 

The postulates were made by Robert Koch and Friedrich Loeffler in 1884, based on earlier ideas of Jakob Henle. They were refined and published by Koch in 1890. 

Koch applied the postulates to cholera and tuberculosis, but they have been used for other diseases. These postulates were made before viruses were discovered. Also, they did not realise that some people were "asymptomatic carriers": they could carry the disease without showing signs of it. The postulates are little used today. Other criteria are used, for example the Bradford Hill criteria for infectious diseases in modern public health.

Koch's postulates:

Greylag goose

The greylag goose ("Anser anser") is a species of large grey goose in the waterfowl family Anatidae. It is the largest goose. Its distribution is widespread. Birds from the north of its range in Europe and Asia migrate south to spend the winter in warmer places. 

It is the type species of the genus "Anser" and is the ancestor of the domestic goose. It has been domesticated at least since 1360 BC. The genus name is from "anser", the Latin for "goose".

Greylag geese travel to their northerly breeding grounds in spring, nesting on moorlands, in marshes, around lakes and on coastal islands. They normally mate for life and nest on the ground among vegetation. A clutch of three to five eggs is laid. The female incubates the eggs and both parents defend and rear the young. The birds stay together as a family group, migrating southwards in autumn as part of a flock, and separating the following year. During the winter they occupy semi-aquatic habitats, estuaries, marshes and flooded fields, feeding on grass and agricultural crops. Some populations, such as those in Southern England and in urban areas, are resident and occupy the same area year-round.

Eugene Thomas Long

Eugene Thomas Long (March 16, 1935 – March 13, 2020) was born in Richmond, Virginia. He was the author of "Jaspers and Bultmann: A Dialogue Between Philosophy and Theology" (1968), "Existence, Being and God: An Introduction to the Philosophical Theology of John Macquarrie" (1985) and "Twentieth Century Western Philosophy of Religion:1900-2000" (2000).
Long was born in Richmond, Virginia. He is the first son of Eugene Thomas Long, Jr. and Emily Barker Long. He is a graduate of Randolph-Macon College in Virginia (BA), Duke University (BD) and the University of Glasgow, (Ph.D). He was a student of John Macquarrie and Ronald Gregor Smith.

He was a Professor of Philosophy at Randolph Macon College between 1964 and 1970. He was a Professor of Philosophy at the University of South Carolina between 1970 and 2002. During that time he was Chair of the Department of Philosophy (1972-1987). He retired in 2002 as Distinguished Professor of Philosophy Emeritus.

He was elected President of The Metaphysical Society of America and President of the Society for Philosophy of Religion. He served as Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal for Philosophy of Religion (1990-2010) and the Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion.

The major focus of Long’s work is the dialogue between philosophy and theology and he is often characterized both as a philosophical theologian and philosopher of religion. Attracted in his early days to the work of Hegel and British and American Idealism, he is influenced in particular by the work of Karl Jaspers, Martin Heidegger, Paul Tillich and John Macquarrie. Appealing to the theories of experience in the tradition of so-called radical empiricism, Long argues for transcendent dimensions of general human experience to bridge the gap between specifically religious and ordinary experience. 

Long died on March 13, 2020 at the age of 84.

Therapeutic abortion

Therapeutic abortion is a kind of abortion which is carried out because of medical necessity. In some cases, the pregnancy or childbirth is a medical risk to the health of the mother. In other cases, the unborn child would have grave birth defects. Therapeutic abortion is legal in most contries, even if other forms of avortion are illegal. Some countries also have a rule, that abortion is legal for the first part of the pregnancy and illegal afterwards. Even in these cases, therapeutic abortion is often legal. 

Different methods can be used to perform a therapeutic abortion. Abortions are either chemical or surgical in nature.

Chemical abortions, also known as medical abortions, account for approximately 10% of all abortions in North America and Europe. Chemical abortion is performed during the first trimester of pregnancy. There are several ways to perform a chemical abortion. A medicine called misoprostol can be taken with another medicine called methotrexate. Sometimes only misoprostol is given without methotrexate. Sometimes, these two drugs are given together with a third drug, mifepristone. If you have a chemical abortion, you will experience bleeding for a few days after the miscarriage begins. Some chemical abortions are unsuccessful and require subsequent surgical abortion.

There are different types of surgical abortions, performed at different times during pregnancy. Aspiration or vacuum abortion is the most common method and can be performed within the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. Manual vacuum aspiration involves using a manual syringe to remove the fetus through suction. Electric vacuum aspiration involves using an electric pump to remove the fetus. Dilation and evacuation can be performed between 15 and 18 weeks and involves the use of suction and surgical instruments to open and empty the cervix. Dilation and curettage (D&C) involves emptying the uterus using an instrument called a curette. Later in pregnancy, surgical abortion requires the use of other riskie and more controversial procedures.

It is best to do the procedure as early as possible. This will decreases the chance of complications.

Problems are rare, but all procedures have some risk. The doctor will go over some problems that could happen, such as:

Excess bleeding

Allergic reaction

Infection

Incomplete procedure

Gizzard

A gizzard, or "gastric mill", is a part of the stomach which grinds food. Animals which have grinding teeth do not need a gizzard, but there are many animals which do have one.

Gizzards are standard equipment for pterosaurs and birds, dinosaurs, and crocodilia, also many fish, and crustacea. 

Gizzards work because the animal eats some gravel and small stones, and they grind against the food in the gizzard. Gizzards are muscular, and lined with tough material.

In birds, it works like this. Birds swallow food and store it in their crop if necessary. Then the food passes into their stomach, the stomach acid is added here to the food. Then the food passes into the gizzard (also known as the "muscular stomach" or "ventriculus"). The gizzard can grind the food with previously swallowed stones and pass it back to the true stomach, and vice versa. In simple terms, the gizzard 'chews' the food for the bird as it does not have teeth. Bird gizzards are lined with a tough layer made of the carbohydrate-protein complex "koilin", to protect the muscles in the gizzard.

In birds the stomach is before the gizzard, but in grasshoppers the gizzard comes before the stomach. In earthworms there is only a gizzard, and no stomach.

Richard Henderson

Richard Henderson (born 19 July 1945) is a Scottish molecular biologist and biophysicist. He is a pioneer in the field of electron microscopy of biological molecules. He shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2017 with Jacques Dubochet and Joachim Frank.

Henderson has worked at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology (MRC LMB) in Cambridge since 1973, and was its director between 1996 and 2006. He was also a visiting professor at the Miller Institute of the University of California, Berkeley in Spring 1993.

He worked out the structure of bacteriorhodopsin, a molecule in bacteria. The molecule captures energy from light, and uses it to move protons out of the cell. This was the second ever atomic model of a membrane protein. The techniques Henderson developed for electron crystallography are still in use. 

Henderson's methods help to solve the structures of several G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). They are a large protein family of receptors that detect molecules outside the cell. They activate internal signal transduction pathways. This leads to cell responses to the molecules outside the cell.

Lars Onsager

Lars Onsager (November 27, 1903 – October 5, 1976) was a Norwegian-born American physical chemist and theoretical physicist. He held the Gibbs Professorship of Theoretical Chemistry at Yale University. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1968.

Lars Onsager was born in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway. His father was a lawyer. After completing secondary school in Oslo, he attended the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH) in Trondheim, graduating as a chemical engineer in 1925.

In 1925 he discovered that the Debye-Hückel theory of electrolytic solutions was wrong. This theory explained Brownian movement of ions in solution. In 1926 he published a correction to the theory. He traveled to Zürich, where Peter Debye was teaching, and told him his theory was wrong. Debye was so impressed by Onsager's work that he asked him to become his assistant. Onsager stayed at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) until 1928.

In 1928 Onsager went to the United States to teach at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. He was a genius in developing theories, he was not a very good chemistry teacher, and he was dismissed after one semester.

His next job was teaching statistical mechanics at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Again he was found to be no good at teaching. He did make significant contributions to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. The only student who could really understand his lectures on electrolyte systems was Raymond Fuoss. Fuoss eventually joined him at Yale University. 
In 1933, during the Great Depression Brown's decided they could not afford to employ someone who could not teach and he was dismissed. .

His research at Brown was on the effects on diffusion of temperature gradients. He came up with a set of equations  in 1929 now called Onsager reciprocal relations. The importance of these equations in statistical mechanics was not realized for many years. However by 1968 they were considered important for Onsager to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 1933, after leaving Browns, Onsager traveled to Austria to visit electrochemist Hans Falkenhagen. He met Falkenhagen's sister-in-law, Margrethe Arledter. They were married on September 7, 1933, and had three sons and a daughter.

His next job was at Yale University, where he remained for most of the rest of his life, retiring in 1972. At Yale, it was discovered that he had never received a Ph.D. The Norwegian Institute of Technology found that his his work in reciprocal relations was too incomplete to qualify as a doctoral dissertation. Yale said they would accept one of his published papers instead, but Onsager insisted on doing a new research project. His dissertation, called "Solutions of the Mathieu equation of period 4 pi and certain related functions", was too hard for the chemistry and physics faculty to understand. It was only after the mathematics department said they would give him the doctorate instead, that he was granted a Ph.D. in chemistry in 1935. He was appointed assistant professor in 1934, and associate professor in 1940. At Yale he produced brilliant theoretical research, but could not teach or explain ideas to students. He was also unable to direct the research of graduate students, except for the occasional outstanding one.

During the late 1930s, Onsager researched the dipole theory of dielectrics. He again improved on earlier work by Peter Debye. However, when he gave his paper to a journal that Debye edited in 1936, it was rejected. Debye would not accept Onsager's ideas until after World War II. During the 1940s, Onsager studied the statistical-mechanical theory of phase transitions in solids. He came up with a mathematical theory which was enthusiastically received. In a tour de force of mathematical physics, he obtained the exact solution for the two dimensional Ising model in zero field in 1944.

In 1935 he was awarded an honorary degree from the Norwegian Institute of Technology, later part of Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

In 1945, Onsager was naturalized as an American citizen. He  was awarded the title of "J. Willard Gibbs Professor of Theoretical Chemistry". Willard Gibbs worked on using mathematics to solve problems in physics and chemistry. Onsager continuing in the same areas Gibbs had pioneered.
In 1947, Onsager was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and in 1950 he joined the ranks of Alpha Chi Sigma.

After World War II, Onsager researched new topics of interest. He came up with a theoretical explanation of the superfluid properties of liquid helium in 1949. Two years later the physicist Richard Feynman independently proposed the same theory. He also worked on the theories of liquid crystals and the electrical properties of ice. While on a Fulbright scholarship to the University of Cambridge, he worked on the magnetic properties of metals. He developed important ideas on the quantization of magnetic flux in metals. He was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 1958, Willard Gibbs Award in 1962, and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1968. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1975.

In 1972 Onsager retired from Yale. He became a member of the Center for Theoretical Studies, University of Miami, and was appointed Distinguished University Professor of Physics. At the University of Miami he guided and inspired postdoctoral students as his teaching skills had improved. He developed interests in semiconductor physics, biophysics and radiation chemistry. However, his death came before he could produce any breakthroughs comparable to those of his earlier years.

He died from an aneurysm while living in Coral Gables, Florida in 1976. Onsager was buried next to John Gamble Kirkwood at New Haven's Grove Street Cemetery. Onsager's tombstone simply said "Nobel Laureate". When Onsager's wife Gretel died in 1991 and was buried there, his children added an asterisk after "Nobel Laureate," and "*etc." in the lower right corner of the stone.

The Norwegian Institute of Technology established the Lars Onsager Lecture and The Lars Onsager Professorship in 1993 to award outstanding scientists in the scientific fields of  Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics. In 1997 his sons and daughter donated his scientific works and professional belongings to NTNU (before 1996 NTH) in Trondheim, Norway as his Alma Mater. These are now organized as "The Lars Onsager Archive" at the Gunnerus Library in Trondheim.

The Lars Onsager Prize is a prize in theoretical statistical physics. It is awarded annually by the American Physical Society. It was established in 1993 by Drs. Russell and Marian Donnelly.


1967 Chicago blizzard

Statistical physics

Statistical physics is a branch of physics. It uses probability theory, statistics, and mathematical tools to solve certain physical problems. It can describe fields where objects or events seem to be random. It can be used for problems in physics, biology, chemistry, neurology, and even some social sciences, such as sociology. 

Its main purpose is to explain the properties of matter in total, by physical laws governing atomic motion. It was first used in physics to study how particles or objects moved when subjected to a force.

Examples of its use include explaining and quantitatively describing superconductivity, superfluidity, turbulence, and plasma, and the structural features of a liquid. It is widely used in modern astrophysics.

Outfield assist

In baseball, an outfield assist occurs when an outfielder throws out a baserunner somewhere along the base paths, often at one of the bases. The most famous examples of outfield assists are plays made at home plate (plays at the plate), when the outfielder throws the ball to the catcher or other defensive player guarding home plate, and the defensive player then successfully tags out the baserunner who is trying to score.

Biofilm

A biofilm is any group of microorganisms which stick to cell surfaces.

These sticky cells create a slimy layer outside the cells of the body. The cells in the biofilm produce extracellular polysaccharides, proteins, lipids and DNA. Because they have three-dimensional structure they are a community lifestyle for microorganisms. They have been metaphorically described as "cities for microbes".

The biofilm bacteria can share nutrients and are sheltered from harmful factors in their local environment, such as desiccation, antibiotics, and the host's immune system. The film of bacteria which live on your teeth are an example. Biofilms also form on inorganic objects like stones in water.

Desublimation

Desublimation is a phase transition in which gas turns into solid without passing through the liquid state. It is the reverse of sublimation.

It is how snow forms in clouds, and how frost and hoar frost form on the ground or on windows. 

Another example is the soot on walls of chimneys. Soot molecules rise from the fire in a hot and gaseous state. When they come into contact with the walls they cool, and change to the solid state, without forming the liquid state.

The process is sometimes known as deposition (phase transition).

Royal Medal

The Royal Medal is a silver-gilt medal, of which three are awarded each year by the Royal Society. It is also known as The King's Medal and The Queen's Medal (depending on the monarch at the time of the award),

The awards are for work done within the Commonwealth of Nations. The award was created by George IV and awarded first in 1826.

At present, three medals are awarded each year. Two are for fundamental research ("the advancement of natural knowledge") in the physical and biological sciences). One is for applied research ("distinguished contributions in the applied sciences").

Darwin Medal

The Darwin Medal is awarded by the Royal Society once every two years. It is for work in the areas of biology in which Charles Darwin worked. This means evolution, population biology, organismal biology and biological diversity. It was first awarded in 1890. It comes with a £2000 prize.

The award is open to candidates from the Commonwealth of Nations or of the Republic of Ireland, with the requirement that they be either a citizen of such a nation or have lived in such a nation for at least three years before the nomination. 

Since its creation the medal has been awarded over 60 times. The medal was first awarded to Alfred Russel Wallace, who independently developed the theory of evolution by natural selection.

Van Allen radiation belt

A Van Allen radiation belt is a zone of charged particles which come from the Sun as the solar wind. They are captured and held by the Earth's magnetic field.

Earth has two such belts and sometimes others. 
The belts were discovered by James Van Allen. Earth's two main belts extend from the altitude of about 

Most of the particles that form the belts are thought to come from solar wind and other particles by cosmic rays. By trapping the solar wind, the magnetic field deflects those energetic particles and protects the atmosphere from destruction.

The belts are in the inner region of Earth's magnetosphere. The belts trap energetic electrons and protons. The belts endanger satellites, which must have their sensitive components protected with adequate shielding if they spend much time in that zone. In 2013, NASA reported that the Van Allen Probes had discovered a third radiation belt, which was observed for four weeks. It was destroyed by a powerful, interplanetary shock wave from the Sun.

Achernar

Achernar is the name of the primary (or 'A') component of the binary system designated Alpha Eridani (α Eridani).

Grigory E. Volovik

Grigory Efimovich Volovik (; born 7 September 1946 in Moscow) is a Russian theoretical physicist. He is known for his work on solid-state physics and astroparticle physics. His series work in 1970s-2000s about semi metal and topologically protected spinor/femionic excitations in topological defects and boundary are paid enormous amount attentions in recent decade years because the discoveries about the topological solid state materials and potentially technical application on quantum computation. He also contributes a lot on emergent quantum field theory and gravity theory, one idea is phenomenological Q theory of cosmological constant problem.
Volovik completed his master's degree at the Physico-Technical Institute in Moscow. In 1973 he went to the Landau Institute in Moscow, becoming Senior scientist in 1992. He completed his PhD in 1973 with a thesis called the "Dynamics of a particle strongly interacting with a Bose System. In "1981, his habilitation (Russian doctor degree) was on "the Topology of defects in condensed matter". In 1993, he was made Professor at the laboratory for low temperature physics of the Technical University of Helsinki (today's Aalto University), but still worked at the Landau Institute.

In 1992, he received the Landau prize of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In 2004, he received the Simon Memorial Award in low-temperature physics for his "fundamental research on the role of symmetry in low-temperature physics, and applications in Cosmology, quantum gravity, quantum field theory and particle physics" (Eulogy). from 2003 to 2006 he was the leader of the European science Foundation, "Cosmology in the Laboratory". Volovik is the author of several books and of more than 340 scientific journal publications.

In 2001, he became a member of the Finnish Academy of Sciences and in 2007, the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. In 2014, he was awarded the Lars Onsager prize.

One of his contributions in middle of 1970s together with colleges was independently clarify the relationship between topology (Homotopy) of order parameter manifold and defects. Together with few work about topological property of instanton in high energy physics during that time, those work are enter in textbook nowaday. In 1996, the Chiral anomaly originating from the Fermi/Weyl point in superfluid helium-3 has been observed. After almost twenty years, same phenomena has been observed in solid material experiment.

In 1999, he firstly claimed that the existence of Majorana fermion zero mode located in the core of vertex in spinless superconductors.




American Physical Society

The American Physical Society (APS) is the world's second largest organization of physicists. The Society publishes more than 12 scientific journals, including the "Physical Review" and "Physical Review Letters". It organizes more than 20 science meetings each year. APS is a member society of the American Institute of Physics.

The American Physical Society began on May 20, 1899, when a group of 36 physicists met at Columbia University to set up a society "to advance and diffuse the knowledge of physics". At the start the APS only held scientific meetings. In 1913 it took over the "Physical Review," which had begun in 1893 at Cornell University. The "Physical Review" was followed by "Reviews of Modern Physics" in 1929 and by "Physical Review Letters" in 1958.

The APS is now active in public and governmental affairs, and in the international physics community. It has programs in education, science outreach (specifically Physics Outreach), and media relations. APS has about 50,000 members. In 1999, APS Physics celebrated 100 years with the biggest-ever physics meeting in Atlanta. In 2005, APS took the lead role in United States participation in the World Year of Physics. It started several programs to publicize physics during the 100th anniversary of Albert Einstein's annus mirabilis. Einstein@Home, is still an ongoing and popular distributed computing project.

The American Physical Society publishes 13 research journals and a news and commentary website "Physics".

All members of APS receive the monthly publication "Physics Today", published by the American Institute of Physics (AIP).

The American Physical Society gives out a number of awards including the Andrei Sakharov Prize (APS) for outstanding leadership, Aneesur Rahman Prize for Computational Physics, Arthur L. Schawlow Prize in Laser Science, Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics, Lars Onsager Prize in theoretical statistical physics, and more.

Horwath was first elected in the 2004 by-election of the provincial riding of Hamilton East.

In the 2007 Ontario election, Horwath ran in the new riding of Hamilton Centre and won it.

On November 7, 2008, Horwath officially launched her campaign to become the leader of the Ontario New Democrats. The leadership election was held March 6–8, 2009 and she won all three election ballots.

The 2011 provincial election saw a rise for the NDP under Horwath however still in third place. The party was balanced out, with a Dalton McGunity minority government.

In the 2014 provincial election, the NDP was able to continue its seat count of 21, however the Liberals still won a majority government.

Horwath running a third time, against the Liberal government led by Kathleen Wynne and a Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario led by Doug Ford. Horwath promised to introduce a provincial dental plan and prescription drugs. She also promised a child care plan and return Hydro One to public ownership by buying back privately held shares. She also promised to close the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station immediately, while the other party leaders have pledged to keep it open until 2024.

The party's support in public opinion polls increased in May 2018, leading to greater media attention and greater scrutiny for Horwath and her party. She ultimately led the party to official opposition status in the Legislature, the second highest number of seats in the party's history.

Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market

The Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market is a proposed directive (a type of special EU law) that is aimed at protecting EU's existing copyright laws, with particular focus aiming at company intellectual property. It was first introduced to the European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs on 20 June 2018. On 12 September 2018, the European Parliament approved a revised version of this directive. This directive will be expected to take place in January 2019. If this directive passes, each country of the EU will be required to create laws that support it.

The European Council described their key goals as ways to reduce the amount of conflict related to copyright violation. One of their goals is to reduce the "value gap" between the profits made by internet platforms and content creators, which involves requiring financial agreement before they can use their content. Another one of their goals is to encourage "collaboration" between companies and people who use their products. The other goal they proposed is creating copyright exceptions for text and data mining (the use of high quality words to describe specific copyrighted content).

The directive aims to give online publishers more freedom to protect their content from news aggregators (Article 11), as well as requiring websites who primarily host content posted by users to warn users very harshly against posting unauthorized copyrighted content (Article 13).

Articles 11 and 13 have attracted widespread criticism from many people and companies in Europe and North America. Article 11 has been criticised as a "link tax" which would require websites to obtain a license before linking to and previewing (using html snippets) news stories, and Article 13 as a "meme ban", because current content-filtering technology cannot distinguish copyright violation from fair dealing such as parody, and may counteract the panorama freedom. Supporters of the directive, mostly from large companies that support copyright, ignore these claims and think that it is disinformation. People from large companies that support this new directive try to claim that the opposers are trying to make it seem worse than it actually is.

The first draft of the proposed directive was created on 14 September 2016, After many changes to the original draft, the Council of the European Union's Committee of Permanent Representatives approved the new changes on 25 May 2018. Afterwards, they prepared to vote for what would be the final draft of this new directive, but without the support of Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Belgium, or Hungary. The European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs had finished making the final draft of the directive on 20 June 2018. They then discussed in parliament whether the directive will be approved to be added as a new law or not.

On 5 July 2018, this was not approved. Instead, the EU parliament decided to change the date of discussing about the directive on September 2018. There were 318 votes that approved re-opening the debate on a later date, 278 votes that approve the directive immediately, and 31 votes that oppose the directive.

On 12 September 2018, the parliament approved the directive. The final votes for the updated directive were 438 in favour and 226 against. The European Commission, the Council of the European Union, and the European Parliament will now discuss any other details relating to the directive before they release it to the EU. It is expected they will reach a solution in early 2019. If all of these three groups agree, then the directive will be sent to all of the EU. When this happens, each country of the EU will change their existing laws to include information related to this directive.

Romania noticed that the EU was proposing to do meetings about Article 11 and Article 13 on 19 January 2019. Romania cancelled these meetings because Romania's proposal for the directive used wrong wording to describe how the directive will be run. There were 11 countries currently in the EU that did not like Romania's wording to describe Article 11 and 13: Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, Slovenia, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Croatia, Luxembourg, and Portugal. With the exclusion of Portugal and Croatia, the other nine countries that opposed Romania believed that Romania's wording did not cover enough information regarding protecting the EU's citizens' copyright protections. Romania will have an opportunity to improve their wording for Article 11 and 13 to gain a majority vote, but this has caused the final vote for the directive from May 2019.

Article 3 proposes a copyright exception for text and data mining (the use of high-quality words to describe a copyrighted subject, commonly abbreviated as TDM for short) for the purposes of scientific research.

Depending on whether this article (a specific rule of a directive) understands what is considered in the public domain, TDM may increase or decrease copyright restrictions compared to if this article is not approved.

Article 4 proposes that all educational establishments (schools, universities, etc.) are able to use copyrighted content for illustrative purposes only. Once this article has been approved, this article will clarify that educational establishments can make non-commercial use of copyrighted works for illustrative purposes.
Article 11 is a section that will restrict access to linking to other websites. Companies who try to link to other news without permission will be punished.

Article 12a proposes that sport event organizers have full copyright over recordings of their events.

Article 13 is a section that will aim to censor any unauthorized copyrighted content. They will make it compulsory for all companies that post primarily user-generated content to do this.

It is very controversial. People think that it will make it very difficult to share new content on the internet. People also think it will make it confusing for filters to distinguish fair use and copyright violation. People who love memes, tend to call it the "meme ban". They also make memes about the EU in retaliation.

Lots of people think Article 11 and Article 13 are bad. They think they are going to make the internet very restricted. They also think free internet content will become very difficult to find or create.

On November 2018, Google also threatened to shut down YouTube for the EU if the directive passes unless adjustments are made to the directive.

Joseph Lister

Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister, (5 April 182710 February 1912) was a British surgeon and a pioneer of antiseptic surgery.

He promoted the idea of sterile surgery while working at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Lister successfully introduced carbolic acid (phenol) to sterilise surgical instruments and to clean wounds.

Applying Louis Pasteur's advances in microbiology, Lister championed the use of carbolic acid as an antiseptic, so that it became the first widely used antiseptic in surgery. 

He knew it was used to ease the stench from fields irrigated with sewage waste. He thought it was safe because fields treated with carbolic acid had no ill-effects on the livestock that grazed on them.

By 1890, Lister stopped using carbolic acid, due to the dangerous side effects for both patient and surgeon. Rather, he began to use a mask and surgical gloves to prevent infection. 

Lister's work led to a reduction in post-operative infections (infections after an operation). This made surgery safer for patients. So he became known as the "father of modern surgery".

William Thomson

William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, (26 June 1824 – 17 December 1907) was a Scots-Irish mathematical physicist and engineer. He was born in Belfast in 1824.

Kelvin did much to unify physics in its modern form. He also had a career as an electric telegraph engineer and inventor, which propelled him into the public eye and gave him wealth, fame and honour.

For his work on the transatlantic telegraph project he was knighted in 1866 by Queen Victoria, becoming Sir William Thomson. He was noted for his work on the mariner's compass. This had been rather unreliable owing to the iron in ships' hulls.

Absolute temperatures are stated in units of kelvin in his honour. The existence of a lower limit to temperature (absolute zero) was known before his work, but Lord Kelvin found its correct value as approximately −273.15 degree Celsius or −459.67 degree Fahrenheit.

He was made Lord Kelvin in 1892 in recognition of his achievements in thermodynamics, and of his opposition to Irish Home Rule. He became Baron Kelvin, of Largs in the County of Ayr.

He was the first British scientist to be elevated to the House of Lords. His title refers to the River Kelvin, which flows close by his laboratory at the University of Glasgow. Despite offers from several world-renowned universities, Lord Kelvin refused to leave Glasgow, remaining Professor of Natural Philosophy for over 50 years, until his eventual retirement. The Hunterian Museum at the University of Glasgow has a permanent exhibition on the work of Lord Kelvin.

Always active in industrial research and development, he was recruited around 1899 by George Eastman to serve as vice-chairman of the board of the British company Kodak Limited, affiliated with Eastman Kodak.

Alan Abel

Alan Irwin Abel (August 2, 1924 – September 14, 2018) was an American prankster, hoaxer, writer, and mockumentary filmmaker. He was born in Zanesville, Ohio. 

From 1966 to 1967 Abel wrote a weekly syndicated humor column "The Private World of Prof. Bunker C. Hill" that appeared in the "San Francisco Chronicle" and several other newspapers. Following the Watergate scandal, Abel hired an actor to pose as Deep Throat for a press conference in New York City before 150 reporters.

In 1959, Abel started his most elaborate hoax. He appeared on a national TV show as a representative of the "Society for Indecency to Naked Animals" (SINA). SINA's mission was to put clothes on naked animals. Their slogan was: "A nude horse is a rude horse". An actor appeared on television and radio several times, including the CBS Evening News on August 21, 1962. The hoax began as a satire of media censorship, but soon people started sending financial contributions to the organization. (The organization returned the money.) Other people started making official citizen complaints against people for walking naked dogs. Some people started selling clothes for the naked animals.

In 1979, Abel staged his own death from a heart attack near a famous ski resort. A fake funeral director collected his belongings and a woman posing as his widow notified The New York Times. The Times published an obituary January 2, 1980. On January 3, 1980, Abel held a news conference to announce that the "reports of my demise have been grossly exaggerated."

In 1985, Abel organized a TV hoax on The Phil Donahue Show. On that day's program, seven members of the audience appeared to faint during the broadcast, which was seen live on TV. Donahue, the show's host, thought the fainting was caused by both stress from being on television and an overheated studio on a morning that was cold and snowy outside. He cleared the studio of audience members and then resumed the show. It turned out the fainting "spell" was invented by Abel as a protest against bad-quality television.

"Omar's School for Beggars' was a fake school for professional panhandlers. As Omar, Abel was invited to many national television talk shows. He often made the TV hosts angry when he his lunch on camera. The hoax was a satirical commentary on the rise of unemployment and homelessness in the U.S. 

In 1993, when euthanasia was a big topic in the news, Abel set up the fake Florida company "Euthanasia Cruises", which would offer cruises allowing suicidal participants to jump into the ocean after three days of partying. 

In 1999, Abel appeared in the documentary "Private Dicks: Men Exposed", in which he claimed to be the current holder of the Guinness World Record for the smallest penis. Abel did not take off his clothes for the documentary crew. He said that he would only take off his clothes if they agreed to have group sex afterwards. Abel stated that "They said no. So I didn't have to take off my shorts."

At the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Abel introduced a campaign to ban all breastfeeding because "it is an incestuous relationship between mother and baby that manifests an oral addiction leading youngsters to smoke, drink and even becoming anti-social." After 200 interviews over two years, Abel confessed the hoax in U.S. News & World Report.

Abel once ran for Congress. He promised to install a lie detector in the White House and truth serum in the Senate drinking fountain; he wanted all doctors to publish their medical school grade point average in the telephone book after their names; he proposed removing Wednesday to establish a four-day workweek.

Abel died of heart failure complicated by cancer on September 14, 2018 in Southbury, Connecticut at the age of 94.

Relevance

Relevance is the idea that one topic may be useful to another topic: so consider the second topic when considering the first. 

The concept of relevance is studied in many fields, including cognitive sciences, logic, and information science. It is studied in epistemology (the theory of knowledge). 

"Something (A) is relevant to a task (T) if it makes it more likely that the goal (G) can be reached. Similarly, understanding one concept often means understanding other concepts beforehand. This is the main reason why educators work from a syllabus which guides the order in which topics should be taught.

If schizophrenia is caused by bad communication between mother and child, then family interaction studies become relevant. If it is inherited genetically, then the study of family trees becomes relevant. If you are an empiricist, then only carefully designed observations are relevant. If you are a feminist, then the sex of the observer becomes relevant.

Epistemology is not just one domain among others. Epistemological views are always at play in any domain. Those views determine or influence what is regarded relevant.

Relevance is argued to depend upon the "remoteness relationship" between an actual world in which relevance is being evaluated and the set of possible worlds within which it is true.

During the 1960s, "relevance" became a fashionable buzzword, meaning roughly 'relevance to social concerns', such as racial equality, poverty, social justice, world hunger, world economic development, and so on. The implication was that some subjects, e.g., the study of medieval poetry and the practice of corporate law, were not worthwhile because they did not address pressing social issues.

The contrary view is that the social world is not our only concern. We can be (and are) concerned also about many other things. Also, real-world problems are problems because there is no obvious way to solve them. Increases in crop production in the 20th century were all fuelled by developments in basic science, not by social movements.

I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration

"I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration" is an anonymous essay published by "The New York Times" on September 5, 2018. The author was said to be a senior official working for the Donald Trump administration. In October 2020, the author was revealed to be Miles Taylor, Chief of Staff to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in 2019.

The op-ed criticizes Trump and says that many current members of the administration ignore his suggestions for good reasons and for the good of the country. It also says that some cabinet members in the early days of the administration discussed using the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution as a way to remove the president from power.

"The New York Times" editorial board said that it knows the author's identity but granted the person anonymity to protect them from removal and public blacklash. The publication of this editorial was unusual because the "Times" does not often publish anonymously written pieces.

In October 2020, Miles Taylor was revealed to be the author.

Trump reacted in private with what was described as "volcanic" anger. On Twitter he said the author was "failing" and "probably here for all the wrong reasons". He also questioned whether the aide was another "phony source" invented by the "failing "New York Times"". Trump tweeted: "If the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist, the "Times" must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!" He later tweeted: "TREASON?"

Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal

The Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal is a political scandal about a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) signed by U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen and pornographic actress Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 United States presidential election. 

After the NDA was revealed by "The Wall Street Journal" in January 2018, Daniels sued Trump and Cohen to argue that the agreement is invalid. The dispute has gained significant media coverage, and has drawn legal attention to Cohen's involvement in the matter.

In August 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight charges, including one related to the scandal, and he stated under oath that he paid Daniels "in coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office," meaning Trump.

The first reports of an alleged affair between Trump and Daniels were published in October 2011 by the blog "The Dirty" and the magazine "Life & Style". 

On January 12, 2018, "The Wall Street Journal" reported that Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 in October 2016, a month before the presidential election, to stop her discussing an affair she allegedly had with Trump in 2006.<ref name="Rothfeld_Palazzolo_1/12/2018"></ref>

In an interview with "60 Minutes" on March 25, Daniels said that she and Trump had sex once, and that later she had been threatened in front of her infant daughter, and felt pressured to later sign a nondisclosure agreement.

On April 5, 2018, while on Air Force One, Trump said he did not know about the $130,000 payment Cohen made to Daniels. He also said he was not aware of why Cohen had made the payment or where he got the money.

In May 2018, Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said on Fox News that "the president repaid" Cohen the $130,000 that Cohen had paid to Daniels. Giuliani also said that Trump "did know the general arrangement" of Cohen's payment, but not "the specifics".

In June 2018, Daniels sued both Michael Cohen and her own former lawyer, Keith M. Davidson, accusing Cohen of encouraging Davidson to violate her attorney-client privilege. The lawsuit also alleges Trump was aware of the efforts for Daniels to deny the affair on media interviews.

In August 2018, Cohen officially surrendered to the FBI. That afternoon, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight charges: five counts of tax evasion, one count of making false statements to a financial institution, one count of willfully causing an unlawful corporate contribution, and one count of making an excessive campaign contribution at the request of a candidate or campaign. He also said two senior Trump Organization executives were also involved in the hush money payments.

In September 2018, lawyers for Trump said that Trump will neither enforce the non-disclosure agreement nor oppose Daniels' claim that it is invalid.

Kennelly–Heaviside layer

The Kennelly-Heaviside layer was named after scientists Arthur Edwin Kennelly and Oliver Heaviside. Its existence was shown in 1924 by Edward V. Appleton, an English physicist who received the Nobel Prize in the year 1947. The Kennelly-Heaviside layer or E region is part of the ionosphere, the top part of the Earth's atmosphere which is full of electricity and magnetism, 90 to 150 kilometers from the Earth's surface. The layer is capable of reflecting medium shortwave electromagnetic radiations, or the EM radiations whose frequency ranges between 300 kHz to 3MHz.

This layer became a popular means of communication in the late 1920's when AM signals (Amplitude Modulated) were transmitted over long distances. AM signals can bounce off the Kennelly-Heaviside. They can go further than signals which cannot bounce off the layer. This means that the sender and receiver of the signal could be over the horizon from each other, and the signal can bounce off the layer in the sky in between them.

Dickinsonia

Dickinsonia is an early type of pre-Cambrian life. They were very different from current organisms. They are considered to be one of the early forms of multicellular organisms. Their bodies were shaped like discs. Based on the fossils, they were between four millimeteers an 1.4m in size. They were only a few millimetres thick. Their body was segmented: there is a large central furrow, and smaller ones around the body of the organism. Their body was symmetric. Mostly based on the shape and size of the fossils found, they have been classified into different species. 

The Dickinsonia species probably did not move around the ocean on their own: they used ocean currents to float around. Possibly they had a way to attach to the ocean floor. Their feeding probably resembled that of the placozoa.

They were also compared to modern-day Cnidarians, Polychaetes, and Turbellaria. Because of the prominent central part, they were also seen as Chordates. Because of their feeding habit, they were classified as similar ot the Placozoa. It was suggested, that they lived in symbiosis with organisms doing photosynthesis, and were possibly comparable to modern-day Lichen; if the mechanism worked the same as in modern-day lichens, they would be fungi.

A study published in 2018, has shown Dickinsonia were animals. 

Very little cholesterol was found outside the specimen in the surrounding rock. The Ediacara biota (571 million to 541 million years ago) is the first complex organisms in the geological record large enough to be seen without magnification.

The first fossils were found in the Flinders Ranges, in Australia in the 1940s. Reginald Sprigg, a paleontologist, published the first scientific study of Dickinsonia in 1947. Sprigg named the genus after Ben Dickinson, who was the director of the Mines of South Australia, at the time. In the study, Sprigg thought t he had found the fossil of a jellyfish. In 1956, Harrington and Moore classified Dickinsonia as Cnidarians.In 1966, they were classified as Annelids. Most Annelid fossils are quite different from fossilized Dickinsonia, but they resemble some fossilized marine worms. S. Manton contradicted this interpretation in 1967. Because of these incertainities, the discussion about how to classify Dickinsonia is still ongoing.

Melvin Eugene Carnahan (February 11, 1934 – October 16, 2000) was an American lawyer and politician. He was the 51st Governor of Missouri from 1993 until his death in a plane crash in 2000. He was a Democrat.

Carnahan was born in Birch Tree, Missouri in 1934. He studied at George Washington University and at the University of Missouri. In 1948, because his father was running for congress, Carnahan was present for Harry S. Truman's last campaign stop in St. Louis. Carnahan would later say his father inspired him to be a politician. 

Carnahan was married to Jean Carpenter from 1954 until his death. They had four children. His daughter is Robin Carnahan, former U.S. Senate candidate and Administrator of General Services. His son is Russ Carnahan, a former U.S. Representative. 

From 1989 to 1993, Carnahan was the Lieutenant Governor of Missouri when John Ashcroft was governor. In 1992, he was elected governor of Missouri and re-elected in 1996.

During his time as governor, Carnahan oversaw the increase and decrease of taxes in the state. He also had to deal with natural disasters such as the Great Flood of 1993, one of the deadliest floods in U.S. History. Carnahan would travel across the state afterwards, and also called a special session of the state legislature to figure out how to pay for the damage.

In 1999, Carnahan, a death penalty supporter, commuted the death sentence of a Missouri inmate, Darrell Mease, after Pope John Paul II asked him to do so during his visit to St. Louis. This move was controversial, with 34% of voters saying that they were more likely to vote against Carnahan in his U.S. Senate bid. 

On November 4, 1998, Carnahan announced his plan to run again incumbent Senator John Ashcroft for his senate seat in 2000. It had been said that neither man liked each other. The campaign became heated and intense, becoming one of the most focused election races in the nation. Carnahan was attacked for his actions as governor, and for other incidents, such as photos of him performing in blackface in 1960. In October, Carnahan was losing to Ashcroft in the polls. He would go on to win the election after his death.

Carnahan was killed in a plane crash near Hillsboro, Missouri on October 16, 2000, aged 66. The 2000 presidential debate, held the next day in St. Louis, opened with a moment of silence and both candidates talked about Carnahan's death.

Lieutenant Governor Roger B. Wilson became governor to serve the rest of Carnahan's term the day after his death. Because Missouri election law would not allow Carnahan's name to be removed from the November 7, 2000, ballot, Governor Wilson promised to pick Carnahan's widow Jean to the seat if Carnahan won the election. Carnahan's campaign continued, using the slogan "I'm Still with Mel." Carnahan became the first person in U.S. history to a win a U.S. Senate election posthumously, winning 50.5% of the vote against Ashcroft's 48.4%.

In 1981, party clown and aspiring stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck lives with his mother, Penny, in Gotham City. Gotham is rife with crime and unemployment, leaving swaths of the population disenfranchised and impoverished. Arthur suffers from a medical disorder that causes him to laugh at inappropriate times, depending on social services for medication. After a gang of delinquents attacks Arthur in an alley, his co-worker Randall gives him a gun for protection. Arthur pursues a relationship with his neighbor, single mother Sophie Dumond, and invites her to his upcoming stand-up routine at a nightclub.

While entertaining at a children's hospital, Arthur's gun falls out of his pocket. Randall lies that Arthur bought the gun himself, and Arthur is fired. On the subway, still in his clown makeup, Arthur is beaten by three drunken Wayne Enterprises businessmen; he shoots two in self-defense and wounds the third before pursuing him off the train and executing him on the stairs. The killings are condemned by billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne, who calls those envious of more successful people "clowns". Demonstrations against Gotham's rich begin, with protesters donning clown masks in Arthur's image. Funding cuts shutter the social service program, leaving Arthur without his medication.

Sophie attends Arthur's stand-up routine, which goes poorly; he laughs uncontrollably and has difficulty delivering his jokes. Arthur's idol, popular talk show host Murray Franklin, mocks Arthur by showing clips from the comedy routine on his show. Arthur intercepts a letter written by Penny to Thomas, alleging that he is Thomas's illegitimate son, and berates his mother for hiding the truth. Arthur goes to Wayne Manor, where he meets Thomas's young son Bruce, but flees after a scuffle with the family butler Alfred Pennyworth. Following a visit from two Gotham City Police Department detectives investigating Arthur's involvement in the train murders, Penny suffers a stroke and is hospitalized.

Arthur sneaks into a private event and confronts Thomas, who tells him that Penny is delusional and not his biological mother. In denial, Arthur visits Arkham State Hospital and steals Penny's case file; the file says Penny adopted Arthur as a baby and allowed her abusive boyfriend to harm them both. However, Penny claims that Thomas used his influence to fabricate the adoption to hide their affair. Distraught, Arthur returns home and enters Sophie's apartment unannounced. Frightened, Sophie tells him to leave; their relationship was merely a figment of Arthur's imagination. The following day, Arthur kills Penny at the hospital.

Arthur is invited to appear on Murray's show due to the unexpected popularity of his comedy routine's clips. As he prepares, Arthur is visited by ex-colleagues Randall and Gary. Arthur murders Randall but spares Gary for treating him well in the past. En route to the studio, Arthur is pursued by the two detectives onto a train filled with clown protesters. One detective accidentally shoots a protester and incites a riot, allowing Arthur to escape; the rioters brutally beat the detectives as Arthur leaves.

Before the show goes live, Arthur requests that Murray introduce him as Joker, a reference to Murray's previous mockery. Arthur walks out to applause, but starts telling morbid jokes, confesses to the train murders, rants about how society abandons the downtrodden and mentally ill, and berates Murray for mocking him on the previous segment. When Murray criticizes him and threatens to call the police, Arthur shoots him twice on live TV, killing him; he is arrested for murder as riots break out across Gotham. One of the rioters corners the Wayne family in an alley and murders Thomas and his wife, Martha, sparing Bruce. Rioters in an ambulance crash into the police car carrying Arthur, freeing him; he stands atop the car, dances to the cheers of the crowd, and smears blood on his face in the form of a smile.

At Arkham, Arthur laughs to himself about a joke and tells his psychiatrist she would not understand it. He runs from orderlies, leaving behind a trail of bloodied footprints.

Tcl

Tcl (pronounced "tickle" or "tee cee ell" ) or Tool Command Language is a High-level programming language which can be used for many things. Tcl was made to be easy to use, but able to do many things. Tcl's language is based on commands which tell the computer what to do or how to save a variable. Tcl is able to do object-oriented, imperative, functional, or procedural styles.

Tcl is used a lot to in C to create prototypes quickly. There are interpreters available for many operating systems. This means many different kinds of computers are able to run Tcl code. Tcl is a very small language which means it is good to use as embedded systems.

Tcl is sometimes combined with Tk. When it is, it is called Tcl/Tk. Tcl/Tk is a part of the normal Python installation.

Tcl was created by John Ousterhout at University of California, Berkeley. Ousterhout won a ACM Software System Award in 1997 for making Tcl/Tk.

Safe-Tcl is a form of Tcl that has certain parts turned off so it can't hurt the computer which is running it. Nathaniel Borenstein and Marshall Rose created Safe-Tcl. Safe-Tcl can only work on some files including email messages.

In Tcl programming, empty whitespace separates words. Commands are ended by going to a new line or a semicolon:

The first word is always a command which comes from Tcl's library:

For example, the commmand "puts" makes the computer display something:
puts "Hello, World!"
In that example, "Hello, World!" is called a string. Tcl adds a special character which can't be seen at the end of a line. This character tells the computer to go a new line after the command is complete.

Tcl is able to do math and many other things using variables. In order to use a variable, the programmer must set their value:
set variableA 1
set variableB 2
After a variable is set, it can be used in other parts of the program or set to something different. Variables can be used to perform math:
set x 2
set y 4
set ans [expr $x+$y]
puts "The answer is $ans." # The computer would show: "The answer is 6."
The command "expr" tells the computer to solve the "expression" or, in this case, an equation.

New Walk Museum

The New Walk Museum and Art Gallery is a museum in Leicester, England. It opened in 1849 as one of the first public museums in the United Kingdom. New Walk contains displays of both science and art, international and local.

Two skeletons are permanently on display — a cetiosaur found in Rutland, and a plesiosaur from Barrow upon Soar. The dinosaur is a specimen of "Cetiosaurus oxoniensis". The 15 metre dinosaur is among the most complete sauropod skeletons in the world. The bones in the display are mostly replicas of the originals, which are too fragile to be used.

The Barrow Kipper, named after the flatfish, is a skeleton of a plesiosaur discovered in Barrow upon Soar in 1851. It has been wrongly classified twice, and at present has no accepted name. Other "star attractions" of the gallery are a "Leedsichthys" (a giant fossil fish) and a piece of the Barwell meteorite.

The museum has a specimen of international importance, the Charnia fossil. This was the first fossil ever described from undoubted Precambrian rocks. Until then, no large (non-microscopic) forms of life were known to exist at that time. The object in the museum – "Leicester's fossil celebrity" – is a holotype. It is the actual physical example from which the species was first identified and formally described. "Charnia masoni" was named after Roger Mason. He discovered it in Charnwood Forest in 1957, when he was a schoolboy. He who went on to a career as an academic geologist. The fossil had been discovered a year earlier by a schoolgirl, Tina Negus, "but no one took her seriously".

The museum holds the UK's largest collection of German Expressionist art. These paintings, including works by George Baselitz, Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee, were smuggled out of Nazi Germany before World War II. The Nazis condemned the work of these painters. Hans Hess, son of the German-Jewish industrialist and art collector, Alfred Hess, was assistant curator at the museum.

In 2007, more than 100 pieces of art went on display at the museum, donated by Richard Attenborough, namely a collection of Picasso ceramic art.

On the first floor of the museum is an exhibition area that changes periodically. Recent exhibits have included a display focusing on the search for the remains of Richard III, a "Wallace and Gromit" display, and "Spirits of War to Hands of Peace", an exhibit of paintings and sculpture on the horrors of war and the power of peace.

Weinstein effect

The Weinstein effect is a trend in which men and women come forward to accuse other famous or powerful men and women of sexual abuse, harassment or misconduct. The term "Weinstein effect" came into use in October 2017. That's when media outlets began reporting on alleged sexual abuse against movie producer Harvey Weinstein.

The effect gave rise to the Me Too movement. That movement encourages people to share any experience of sexual harassment or sexual assault. The two events caused a cascade of allegations. The allegations brought about a fast removal of many men and women in positions of power in the United States.

As a result, many notable figures were accused of sexual harassment/abuse such as Kevin Spacey, Charlie Rose, Louis C.K., Dustin Hoffman, Matt Lauer, U.S. Representative John Conyers, United States Senator Al Franken, former Senate candidate Roy Moore, Les Moonves, Garrison Keillor, Welsh MP Carl Sargeant, Asia Argento and U.S. Associate Justice-nominee Brett Kavanaugh.

Triptych

A triptych is a series of three separate paintings that together form a story. The word comes from the Greek adjective "triptukhon" (three-fold), from "tri", (three) and "ptysso", (to fold) or "ptyx", (fold) The paintings are usually joined together, with hinges, so that they can be folded shut or displayed open. The middle painting is usually larger, although they can be of equal size.

A triptych is usually an art work, but the word can be used for anything in three parts which join together to make a single item. 

The French and Burgundian Early Netherlandish painter Simon Marmion painted a diptych on the life of St Bertin which became a de facto Triptych

Left:reconstruction of the outside panels; center:reconstruction of the inside panels; right reconstruction of the Saint Bertin Altarpiece.
The most important painted work attributed to Simon Marmion is the altarpiece commissioned in 1455-1459, for the main altar of the abbey of Saint Bertin in Saint-Omer, by his abbot Guillaume Fillâtre, bishop of Toul then of Tournai, advisor to Philip the Good. Only the two panels of the altarpiece remain today; they are scattered between the National Gallery in London (two panels representing Angels). 
and the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin (two long panels illustrating scenes from the life of Saint Bertin). The central part, in goldwork, has melted down in 1791 (French Revolution)
The English painter William Etty painted a 28 ft (8.5 m) wide and 9 ft 9 in (3 m) high triptych of the life of Saint Joan of Arc. Etty sold the painting; The new owners were an engraver and a dealer who went bankrupt in 1852. The paintings were separated and sold by 1893. The first panel which showed Joan of Arc finding the sword in the church of St. Catherine de Fierbois ended up in the collection of Llantarnam Abbey, Cwmbran, South Wales, U.K. (The Painting was sold at Auction by Bonham in 2021) The Second panel is in the collection of the Musée des Beaux-Arts d'Orléans. The third panel has since been lost.

Epenthesis

Epenthesis is a term in phonology. It refers to adding one or more sounds to a word. 

If it is added at the beginning, it is called "prothesis". If added at the end of the word, it is called "paragoge". There are two types of epenthesis: when a consonant is added, and when a vowel is added. The opposite process where one or more sounds are removed is called elision.

Epenthesis can happen for many reasons. The rules of how sounds are placed in a language may not allow vowels next to each other, but in different syllables. Some consonant clusters may not be allowed. In this situation a consonant or vowel can be added to make pronunciation easier. Epenthesis may be shown in writing or may happen in spoken language.

A consonant can be added to separate spoken vowels in hiatus. This happens with linking and intrusive R, which is a rule that puts an 'r' in a place where it doesn't normally happen.


A consonant can be placed between consonants in a consonant cluster where the place of articulation is different (e.g., where one consonant is labial (pronounced with the lips) and the other is alveolar. 


A vowel can be placed between consonants to separate them.


Regular examples in English are "-i-", used in making words from Latin such as "equidistant", and "-o-", used in making words from Greek roots or general compound words, as in "speedometer".


In French, is placed in inverted interrogative phrases between a verb that ends in a vowel and a pronoun that begins with a vowel: ('he has') > ('has he?').  Because the  come from Latin ('he has') there is no epenthesis from the point of view of history. This is because the is the original third-person verb inflection. However it is correct to call it epenthesis in the modern language because the modern basic form of the verb is , so the way the process works in the mind is to add a  to the basic form.

A similar example is the English indefinite article "a", which becomes "an" before a vowel. It comes from Old English "ān" ("one, a, an"), which kept an "n" in all positions. From a diachronic (historical) analysis, the original "n" disappears, except if a following vowel needs for it to stay: "an" > "a". However, with a synchronic analysis people can also see it as epenthesis: "a" > "an". This is how most native speakers see it.

In Dutch, when the suffix "-er" (which has several meanings) is placed after a word which already ends in "-r", another  is put in the middle. For example, the comparative form (the form people use to compare things) of the adjective "zoet" ("sweet") is "zoeter", but the comparative of "zuur" ("sour") is "zuurder" and not the expected *. The same happens with the agent (someone who does something) noun form of "verkopen" ("to sell") which is "verkoper" ("salesperson"), but the agent noun of "uitvoeren" ("to perform") is "uitvoerder" ("performer").

In English, people often add a stop consonant in nasal + fricative combinations:

Scottish Americans

Scottish Americans are American citizens whose ancestry originated wholly or partly in Scotland, a constituent country of the United Kingdom. The majority of Scots who immigrated to the USA were originally from Northern England and Lowland Scotland before migrating to the province of Ulster in Ireland (Scots-Irish) and colonists. Large immigration from Scotland to the USA begin in the 1700s.

The Ulster-Scots originally came from the Lowlands and the Scottish border before migrating to the province of Ulster, Ireland. From there, they would have emigrated in large numbers five generations later to North America during the eighteenth century.

Today, most Americans of Scottish ancestry are concentrated in New England and the American South, with Florida, Ohio, Washington, Utah, New York and Pennsylvania also having large Scottish populations.

Many people believe that Uncle Sam, the national personification of the United States and its people, was inspired by Samuel Wilson, a meat packer from Troy, New York, whose grandfather, Robert Wilson, was a Scottish immigrant from Greenock, Scotland to Massachusetts Bay Colony.

Asiana Airlines Flight 733 (OZ733, AAR733, registration HL7229) was a domestic Asiana Airlines passenger flight. The flight was from Seoul-Gimpo International Airport to Mokpo Airport, South Korea. 

The flight crashed on 26 July 1993 in the Hwawon area of Haenam County, South Jeolla Province. 68 of the 116 passengers and crew on board were killed, including the captain and first officer.

The flight crashed on July 26 1993 after three failed landing attempts. The flight had 110 passengers and 6 crew members. The crash killed 68 people. It is the second deadliest crash in South Korean history.

Asiana Airlines Flight 733 took-off from Seoul on 26 July 1993 2:37 pm and was supposed to arrive in Mokpo around 3:30 p.m. Captain Hwang In-Gi and First Officer Park Tae-Hwan were flying the plane. The weather was clear and fine in Seoul when the plane took off and the airline almost came near Mokpo. However the weather in their destination had heavy rain and strong wind so there was a minimum visibility level. The plane attempted its first landing at 3:24 pm. but it was unsuccessful. The second attempt was at 3:28 pm but was also unsuccessful. Finally, the final attempt was made at 3:38 pm. Suddenly, Asiana Airline 733 had lost communication with the control post and its last correspondence was 3:41 pm. Control post kept connecting to 733 flight but they couldn't get an answer. The Asiana Airline has made an official announcement that flight 733 was missing. Few hours later, the airline 733 was found at Mt. Ungeo in Masan-ri Hwawon-myeon, Haenam-Gun about 10 km from Mokpo Airport. 

After an investigation for the cause of the crash, it was found out that the  flight was below the minimum safe altitude (1,600 feet) when it attempted its final landing. This was the reason it crashed into the mountainside. Also, having no instrument for landing (ILS) in Mokpo Airport contributed to the crash as it was hard for the pilot to find a safe place to land the plane in the bad weather.
