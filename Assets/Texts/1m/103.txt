Josephoartigasia

Josephoartigasia is an extinct genus of giant rodent from the Pliocene. It is related to the living pacarana. The genus includes the largest known rodent, "Josephoartigasia monesi". 

The two species would have looked like gigantic pacarana, or capybaras the size of cows. However, Dr Virginie Millien, from McGill University in Montreal, said the mathematical models originally used to calculate the rodent's mass from its skull probably overestimated its body size.

A recent report said it had big front teeth, which it might have used for defence.

Game bird

A game bird is any of a number of species of wild birds which are hunted, killed and eaten by humans. Hunting game birds is a sport, and a way of getting food. Usually there are laws which govern the hunting. Usually, guns are used, and so there are gun laws. Also, regulations protect the birds' breeding season, so that another generation of birds will grow to replace the present generation.

Although the birds are wild, most of them are "managed" if they live on estates. Birds which migrate cannot be managed in the same way. Shooting game birds on Scottish estates is for them a major source of income. The managing consists of making sure there are enough birds for the next shooting season. 

In the United Kingdom game is defined in law by the Game Act 1831. It is illegal to shoot game on Sundays or at night. Other (non-game birds) that are hunted for food in the UK are specified under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the Forestry Commission have a big say in how the hunting is regulated.

UK law defines game as including:


Royal Society for the Protection of Birds

The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) is an organisation registered in Great Britain as a charity. It was founded as the Plumage League in 1889 by Emily Williamson.

The RSPB works to promote conservation and protection of birds and the wider environment. It runs public awareness campaigns and petitions, and it operates nature reserves throughout the United Kingdom.

The RSPB has 2,000 employees, 17,600 volunteers and more than a million members (including 150,000 youth members). It is the largest wildlife conservation charity in Europe. The RSPB has many local groups and maintains 200 nature reserves.

The group gained popularity and eventually amalgamated with the Fur and Feather League in Croydon to form the RSPB.

The original members of the RSPB were all women. They campaigned against the fashion of wearing exotic feathers in hats. To this end the Society had two simple rules:
At the time of founding, the trade in plumage for use in hats was very large: in the first quarter of 1884, almost 7,000 bird-of-paradise skins were being imported to Britain, along with 0.4 million birds from the West Indies and Brazil, and 0.36 million birds from British India.

The Society attracted support from some women of high social standing who belonged to the social classes that popularised the wearing of feathered hats, including the Duchess of Portland (who became the Society's first President) and the Ranee of Sarawak. The organisation began to attract the support of many other influential figures, both male and female, such as the ornithologist Professor Alfred Newton. The society received a Royal Charter in 1904 from Edward VII. It petitioned Parliament to introduce laws banning the use of plumage in clothing.

For many he's unknown but for others he's the famous creator of the 'Johan Cruyff' penalty.

5 June, 1957, Belgium was facing Iceland in a World Cup Qualification match. The match started perfectly for Les Diables Rouges who soon were leading the game by a ludicrous 6-1 against a weak and pretty much unknown adversary who still had to face over forty-five minutes of pain.

In the 44th minute of the game, near the end of the first-half, referee whistles for what would be one of the best penalties of the entire history. 'Rik' Coppens was the one chosen to be the executioner of it but instead of shooting directly to the net, he passed to his teammate André Piters who shot for the 7-1. The game didn't ended there, the second half was open for more goals, specially for Iceland, but were not enough to change a sure winner since it ended with a magnificent 8-3 and with a penalty that changed an entire nation of football lovers since then.

This particular way of scoring a penalty, the two-man penalty, was remade by many over the years, and even failed by many like Thierry Henry and Robert Pirès, but when someone talks about this particular style of scoring there is one name that immediately pops up – Johan Cruyff. A player who, with the help of his teammate Jasper Olsen, when both were players of Ajax, scored one of this amazing penalties against .

Cruyff passed the ball to Jasper who then passed it back to a magnificent and cruel finish that many will remember for years.

After his career as a player, he became a coach with Tubantia Borgerhout (1970-1971), Berchem (1971-1974 and 1977-1981), Beerschot (1974-1977 and 1981-1984) and Club Brugge (1981).

John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts

The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (commonly called the Kennedy Center) is a performing arts center in Washington, D.C. The Center opened on September 8, 1971. It shows theater, dance, ballet, orchestral, chamber, jazz, popular, and folk music performances.

It is the busiest performing arts center in the United States of America. Each year, it hosts about 2,000 performances, and almost two million people watch one of these performances. The Center presents music, dance, and theater to the public; helps artists make new works and does arts education.

The "National Cultural Center Act" of Congress in 1958 requires that its programming must be paid for through private money. The center is a public-private partnership. It mostly gets its money from ticket sales and gifts from individuals, corporations, and private foundations. It also gets federal funding each year to pay for the maintenance and operation of the building. It is both the nation's public memorial to President John F. Kennedy and the "national center for the performing arts."

The building was designed by architect Edward Durell Stone, built by Philadelphia contractor John McShain, and is administered by a bureau of the Smithsonian Institution.

In 1933, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt first had the idea for the center. It was during the Great Depression, and she thought the government should provide jobs for unemployed actors. In 1935 and 1938, the United States Congress talked about making a building for it in Washington D.C., but the only thing they did was add a small auditorium to the Library of Congress.

In 1950, Representative Arthur George Klein proposed a bill to build a cultural center. Congress debated the bill between 1955 and 1958. The bill was passed in summer 1958 and President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed it into law on September 4, 1958.

This was the first time that the federal government provided money for a structure dedicated to the performing arts. It cost a total of $70 million to build it. Congress gave most of the money, but donations from foundations, individuals, and businesses were also given.

Edward Durell Stone was chosen as the architect.

Construction of the building began on December 11, 1965.

Basophil

Basophils, or basophil granulocytes, are rare granulocytes. If you had 10,000 white blood cells, only 1–30 of them would be basophils.

Basophils contain large cytoplasmic granules. When stained, the granules hide the cell nucleus from sight. However, when unstained, the nucleus is visible and it usually has two lobes.

The mast cell, another granulocyte, is similar in appearance and function. Both cell types store histamine, a chemical that is secreted by the cells when stimulated. However, they come from different cell lines. Mast cells usually do not circulate in the blood stream, but instead stay in connective tissue. Like all circulating granulocytes, basophils go from the blood into a tissue when needed.

The name comes from the fact that these leukocytes are basophilic, i.e., they are stained by basic dyes, as shown in the illustrations.

How they work is not well understood. Basophils have protein receptors on their cell membrane which binds IgE, an immunoglobulin involved in macroparasite defence and allergy. They are found in unusually high numbers at sites of ectoparasite infection, for example, by ticks.

Staining

Staining is used in microscopy to make cells and tissues easier to see and understand.

This is a way to improve contrast in the microscopic image. Stains and dyes are often used in biology and medicine to highlight structures in biological tissues, often with the aid of different microscopes.

Staining can be done on living tissues ("in vivo") or on dead tissues ("in" "vitro").

Dead tissue needs to be "fixed" so it does not decay. The fixative keeps the structure as it is. After fixation a tissue may be cut into thin slices, and put on a series of glass microscope slides. Occasionally, it is necessary to dissolve cell membranes so large dye molecules can get into the cells. Standards are published in the "Biotechnic & Histochemistry" journal.

The simplest way is to dip the slide plus specimen into a solution of dye, then rinse it and examine. The stains used are certified stains, tested by the Biological Stain Commission.

Gram staining is used to classify bacteria. It is based on the composition of their cell wall. Gram staining uses crystal violet to stain cell walls, iodine as a mordant, and a counterstain which marks all bacteria.

Gram-positive bacteria stain dark blue or violet. Their cell wall lacks the secondary membrane and lipopolysaccharide layer found in Gram-negative bacteria.

On most Gram-stained preparations, Gram-negative organisms are red or pink from the counterstain.

Haematoxylin and eosin staining is often used in histology for thin sections of tissue. Haematoxylin stains cell nuclei blue, while eosin stains cytoplasm, connective tissue and other extracellular substances pink or red.

Eosin is strongly absorbed by red blood cells, colouring them bright red. In a skilfully made H & E preparation the red blood cells are almost orange, and collagen and cytoplasm (especially muscle) go different shades of pink. Hematoxylin stains the cell nucleus and other acidic structures (such as RNA-rich portions of the cytoplasm and the matrix of hyaline cartilage) blue. In contrast, eosin stains the cytoplasm and collagen pink.

A quick and simple stain used on blood smears, and human cheek cells is methylene blue, which stains the nuclei. There are many other specialist stains, some fluorescent under special light.

Lunar calendar

A lunar calendar is a calendar that is based on the phases of the Moon. Because there are slightly more than twelve lunar months (29.53 days each) in a solar year, the period of 12 lunar months (354.37 days) is sometimes referred to as a lunar year.

A common purely lunar calendar is the Islamic calendar.The First Islamic Calendar was First introduced in the reign of 2nd khalipha Umar ibn khitab(r.a). It is calculated from one crescent moon to the next crescent moon. A feature of the Islamic calendar is that a year is always 12 months. So the months are not linked with the seasons. They drift each solar year by 11 to 12 days. It comes back to the position it had in relation to the solar year approximately every 33 Islamic years. It is used mainly for religious purposes, but in Saudi Arabia it is the official calendar. Other lunar calendars often include extra months added occasionally to synchronize it with the solar calendar.

The oldest known lunar calendar was found in Scotland. It dates back to around 8,000 BC.

Archaeoceti

The Archaeoceti ('ancient whales'), or Zeuglodontes in older literature, is a group of primitive cetaceans. They lived from the early Eocene to the late Oligocene, 5523 million years ago (mya). They were the first cetacean radiation, and they include the first amphibious stages in cetacean evolution. So they are the ancestors of both modern cetacean suborders, Mysticeti and Odontoceti.

The group evolved in the shallow waters that separated India and Asia 55–45 mya. About 30 species have been found which were adapted to a fully oceanic life. Modern characters such as echolocation and filter-feeding evolved later, in a second radiation .

All archaeocetes from 55 to 48 mya are only from Indo-Pakistan. By 41–34 mya genera are known from across the Earth, including North America, Egypt, New Zealand, and Europe. They were very unlikely to be as well-adapted to the open ocean as living cetaceans, so they probably got to North America along coastal waters. They could have gone around Africa and over to South America. More likely, over the Tethys Sea (between Eurasia and Africa) and along the coasts of Europe, Greenland, and North America.

The group is a paraphyletic because it gave rise to the two separate modern suborders.

They exist in the same film, but they don't add up to the result of the film. Actually, the film has no result—just an ending, leaving us with all of those fine pieces, still waiting to come together. If this were a screenplay and not the final product, you could see how with one more rewrite, it might all fall into place."

Here you might think she has no accent, unless you've heard her real speaking voice; then you realize that Guaspari's speaking style is no less a particular achievement than Streep's other accents. This is not Streep's voice, but someone else's - with a certain flat quality, as if later education and refinement came after a somewhat unsophisticated childhood."

Transcription factor

Transcription factors help to regulate genes. Each transcription factor binds to a specific DNA sequence. That is how they control the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA.

A transcription factor is sometimes called a 'sequence-specific DNA-binding factor'. Alone or with other proteins, they promote or block RNA polymerase. RNA polymerase is the enzyme that copies genetic information from DNA to RNA for specific genes.

Transcription factors have one or more DNA-binding domains (DBDs). These attach to sequences of DNA next to the genes they regulate. Other proteins (such as coactivators, chromatin remodellers, histone acetylases or deacetylases, kinases, and methylases) also play crucial roles in gene regulation. Because they lack DNA-binding domains, they are not called transcription factors.

Join (SQL)

A SQL Join clause is a way to retrieve information from two or more tables in a database. When a database programmer wants to do a join command, they will type about the databases they want to get information from, and the type of join they want to use. There are five types of joins. A normal codice_1, which is also called an codice_2, a codice_3, acodice_4, acodice_5 and codice_6. 

In order for a join to work, there must be information in the tables to be joined that is the same between them. 

Imagine two tables called Employee and Department.

Suppose a database administrator wanted to know what employee worked in what department. While someone could just compare the ID numbers between the two tables, a way to have the information in one place is by doing a JOIN, also known as an INNER JOIN. Because they have one type of data in common, the department ID, the tables can be joined together.
SELECT LastName, DepartmentName FROM employee join department on department.DepartmentID = employee.DepartmentID;
It would make a table that looks like this:

Because Williams in the employee table did not have an department ID, Williams was not printed in the final result.

Inner joins are fine if both tables have a matching record. However, if one table does not have a record for what the join is being built on, the query will fail. But if a database programmer needs to grab information in an event that there is not a matching record for a row on one of the tables, they need to use an outer join.

A left outer join (also known as a left join) will contain all records from the left table, even if the right table does not have a matching record for each row. 

So, using the two tables.

This command is run, which joins the two tables together on a left join.
SELECT *
FROM employee 
LEFT OUTER JOIN department ON employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID;

Unlike the inner join, Williams is printed in the final result, even though Williams did not have a department ID. Because Employee was the left table, or the table first mentioned in the SQL query, SQL returns all of the relevant data needed from it. However, since there was not a department ID for Williams, the Department table was only able to return a null result.

A right outer join works almost like a left outer join, except with how the tables are handled reversed. This time, all of the relevant information will be returned from the right table, even if the left table does not have a matching result. If the left table does not have a matching result, null will be in the place of the missing data.

This command is run, which joins the two tables together on a right join.
SELECT *
FROM employee RIGHT OUTER JOIN department
And this is the final result.

Except for how the tables are treated, left outer joins, and right outer joints work alike. This means, in the left outer join example, if a database programmer were to switch the order of the tables listed from this:
SELECT *
FROM employee 
LEFT OUTER JOIN department ON employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID;
to this (notice how employee and department have switched places)
SELECT *
FROM department 
LEFT OUTER JOIN employee ON employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID;
They would receive the same result as the right outer join example above:

Agilodocodon

Agilodocodon was a shrew-sized docodont from the Middle Jurassic. It is the earliest known tree-climbing mammal-like therapsid.

"Agilodocodon scansorius" was about 13 centimeters from head to tail, and weighed about 27 grams. Its appearance was similar to a squirrel, with a long snout, curved, horny claws and flexible ankle and wrist joints typical of modern arboreal mammals. The front teeth were spade-like, indicating that "Agilodocodon scansorius" could gnaw tree bark and eat gum or sap.

This interpretation is questioned by another palaeontologist. He thinks "Agilodocodon"'s teeth "are quite different" from the modern sap-eating monkeys, and the long, thin lower jaw seems too weak for gnawing tree bark.

The fossils of "Agilodocodon scansorius", with the mole-like "Docofossor brachydactylus", were found by farmers in the Chinese Tiaojishan Formation. They were got and examined by the Beijing Museum of Natural History. The species "Agilodocodon scansorius" was reported in the journal "Science" in 2015.

Docodonta

Docodonta is an order or suborder of extinct mammaliaforms. They lived during the mid- to late-Mesozoic era. 

They had sophisticated molars, from which the suborder gets its name. In the fossil record, isolated teeth and bits of jawbones are found. 

Docodonts are not quite as closely related to the placentals and marsupials as the monotremes are, so they are not included among the crown-group mammals. 

Because of their molars and their lower jaw being a single bone (the dentary), they are generally regarded as mammals. However, those authors who limit the term "Mammalia" to the (living) crown group exclude docodonts. They use the term mammaliaformes instead.

Docodonts were primarily herbivorous or insectivorous. However, "Castorocauda", adapted to a semi-aquatic life, has teeth which suggest it ate fish.

"Castorocauda" is important because the first find was an almost complete skeleton (a real luxury in paleontology). It breaks the "small nocturnal insectivore" stereotype.
It was noticeably larger than most Mesozoic mammaliaform fossils, and gives absolutely certain evidence of hair and fur. Of course, this strongly suggests mammalian-type temperature regulation.


Squamosal bone

The squamosal is a bone of the head of higher vertebrates. It is the main part of the cheek region in the skull, towards the back and lower part of the skull.

In mammals, including humans, it fuses with other bones to form the temporal bone. It is then called the 'squama temporalis'. 

In therapsids (including mammal ancestors) the lower jaw is simplified into just the dentary. This hinges against the squamous part of the temporal bone. It is referred to as a 'dentary-squamosal jaw'.

Sanitation

Sanitation means dealing with human waste (feces and urine) safely . It also includes ways to maintain hygiene by disposing of garbage, treating wastewater and managing hazardous waste. Sanitation is important because it helps prevent the spread of germs and diseases. In past centuries it meant "health" and later "cleanliness". 

In poor countries, many people have poor sanitation because they do not have good toilets. They also do not have good sewage systems. In developed countries, people usually have good sanitation because they have a sewage system to filter disease and toxins from the water. The use of toilets protects the health of a community by keeping germs out of the environment.

There are also other types of toilets that are more economical, better for the environment, and do not need big sewer systems or wastewater treatment plants. Examples are dry toilets and twin-pit pour-flush toilets (of which many have been installed in India).

"Eryops" averaged a little over 1.5-2.0 meters (5–6.5 ft) long, so it was one of the largest land animals of its time. It weighed about 90 kilograms (200 lb). It probably had few predators, although the apex predator of the time was the synapsid "Dimetrodon", which was even larger. Several complete skeletons of "Eryops" have been found in the Lower Permian, but skull bones and teeth are the most common fossils.

"Eryops" was better adapted to a terrestrial environment than its ancestors. Sturdy limbs and a strong spine supported the body while out of water.

Pyramidion

A pyramidion (plural pyramidia) is the very top piece of an Egyptian pyramid. They were called "benbenet" in the Ancient Egyptian language. In Egypt's Old Kingdom, pyramidia were made of diorite, granite, or limestone. These were then covered in gold or electrum. The gold would reflect the rays of the sun. In later times they were made from granite which had royal titles and religious symbols cut into them.

Very few pyramidia still exist. Most of those that have are made of polished black granite, with the name of the pyramid's owner cut into them. There are four pyramidia on show in the main hall of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. They include the pyramidia from the Black Pyramid of Amenemhat III at Dahshur and the Pyramid of Khendjer at Saqqara.

A badly damaged white Tura limestone pyramidion is thought to have been made for the Red Pyramid of Sneferu at Dahshur. It has been rebuilt and put on show at the side of the pyramid. However it does not match, as its angles are steeper than that of the sides of the pyramid.

During the New Kingdom, some private underground tombs had a small brick pyramid built on top of them. These pyramids were topped with a pyramidia. The four sides included texts and scenes about the cult of the Sun god Ra.

The scenes usually show the course of the sun. It is shown rising on one side, and setting on the opposite side, and traveling, through the night, through the underworld, ruled by Osiris.

The pyramidion of the scribe Moses was made about 1250 BC from limestone. It is 53 cm tall and shows him making an offering, with his name, on two opposite sides. The other two sides show a baboon which represents the god Thoth.

The pyramidion of Ptahemwia was made about 1200 BC, from limestone. It is 28 cm wide and 42 cm tall, and shows sun-related scenes. The Sun god, Ra, and the god of the Underworld, Osiris, are shown on one side. On another side is Ptahemwia, standing in an offering pose, facing three columns of hieroglyphs.

Saqqara

Saqqara (), or Sakkara, is a vast ancient burial ground in Egypt, in area. It was the necropolis for the Ancient Egyptian capital, Memphis. Saqqara has numerous pyramids, including the world famous Pyramid of Djoser. This is sometimes referred to as the Step Tomb due to its rectangular base, and its 'steps' (mastabas: the Arabic word for 'bench'). It is about south of Cairo.

Djoser's pyramid is the oldest complete stone building complex known. It was built in the Third Dynasty. Another 16 Egyptian kings built pyramids at Saqqara: these pyramids are now in various states of preservation. High officials added private funeral monuments to this necropolis during the whole pharaonic period. It was an important complex for non-royal burials and cult ceremonies for more than 3,000 years, well into Ptolemaic and Roman times.

In 2018, an undisturbed tomb was discovered. It is believed to be the tomb of the royal priest Wahtye. The intact interior includes figures with colors on sculptures and wall carvings.

The area from Giza to Dahshur was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. The official name is "Memphis and its Necropolis – the Pyramid Fields from Giza to Dahshur". 

Some scholars think the name 'Saqqara' is not taken from the ancient Egyptian funerary god Sokar, but from a supposed local Berber Tribe called Beni Saqqar.

Bramble Cay melomys

The Bramble Cay melomys, or Bramble Cay mosaic-tailed rat ("Melomys rubicola"), is an extinct species of rodent in the family Muridae. While it was similar to the Cape York melomys it had some protein differences and a coarser tail. It was genetically different to species from Australia and New Guinea. It lived in burrows it had dug among plants, or under branches and leaves on the ground. It was a nocturnal animal, and scientists believe it was a vegetarian.

The Bramble Cay melomys was known only from a small population in Bramble Cay, a vegetated coral cay of . The cay is in the eastern part of Torres Strait, off the northern tip of Australia. It is only 50 km from New Guinea. The melomys were probably trapped on the island by rising sea levels after the last ice age. It is also possible to have come from the Fly River, perhaps floating on branches. Scientists do not know much about the animals that live in the Fly River area.

In the 1800s, there were lots of melomys on the island. A search in 1998 found 42 animals. Another search in 2002 found 10 animals. In 2004 a search found 12, but the melomys have not been seen since. During this time, the sea level has risen, making the island smaller, and turtles and sea birds have eaten most of the plants. Scientists believe the Bramble Cay melomys is extinct. It is possible that the species may be found on nearby islands as many of these have never been searched. However, in June 2016, researchers from Queensland's Department of Environment and Heritage Protection, and the University of Queensland reported that the species had indeed become extinct.

Sex assignment

Sex assignment or gender assignment is the process of determining the sex of a baby, whether it is a boy or a girl. Usually, the doctor, parents or midwife look at the sex organs of a newborn baby to do this. The assigned sex is written on the birth certificate, passport and other identification papers.

Even though it is called "assignment," these adults are not literally assigning (choosing) whether the child is male or female. In most people, the sex assigned at birth matches the person's own gender identity. If the assigned sex does not match a person's gender identity, the person is transgender. In a very small number of newborn babies, it is not possible to tell whether the child's body is male or female by looking at the sex organs. These people are intersex.

Mastiff

The Mastiff, also called the English Mastiff, is a large breed of dog. They have a rectangular body, thick muscles and a massive head with a wrinkled forehead. They stand from to at the shoulder and typically weigh between and . The Mastiff is one of the largest breeds of dogs who can outweigh many full-grown men. They can be gentle with family members but are also excellent guard dogs.

The early Mastiff was called a molosser or molossus. Genetics and breeding dogs to get certain characteristics was unknown then. In 350 BC, Aristotle wrote that the ancestor of the Mastiff was the Molosser. These were the war dogs and guard dogs kept by the Molossoi people, an ancient Greek tribe. Today the two names are often used to mean the same group or family of dogs. For example, the modern St. Bernard is sometimes described as a mastiff and sometimes as a molosser type.

While the Mastiff is a recognized breed, there are also a number of working dog varieties that are closely related to the Mastiff. Many prefer to class them as molosser breeds so as not to confuse them with the Mastiff dog breed. Currently there are about 14 different breeds in the molosser/mastiff family of dogs that are bred from or have a common ancestor with the Mastiff. These include the:


There are also a large number of dog breeds not called molossers or mastiffs, but are related to them. Some of these include the:
The list includes many more.

When training a Mastiff, it is important to recognize they have a certain personality type that needs additional time and patience to learn things. A Mastiff is a very relaxed dog and takes his or her time in doing a task. Owners call this the "Mastiff tempo". A Mastiff can't be trained the same as a Border Collie. In temperament, a modern Mastiff is a patient, sweet-tempered family guardian and companion. Gentle training works best. It is important to start that training early in puppyhood. They are a dog of tremendous size and strength and owning a Mastiff is a large responsibility.

Mastiffs are very predictable when they are facing a threat to their family. If an owner and another person act in a threatening way, the Mastiff will usually get between them to protect its owner. This is hard for the other person to miss and usually results in a cooling down of a heated discussion. But, if the situation does get worse, the Mastiff will usually growl or snarl at the other person as a warning. 

Early socialization is important so the Mastiff knows who belongs in the house and who does not. For example, if a Mastiff puppy sees strangers coming and going all the time, they tend to see this as normal and might not recognize an intruder if they see one. However, a properly trained and socialized Mastiff will usually corner a burglar or intruder. Unless the intruder does something foolish, like try to hurt the dog, he or she will probably not be hurt.


Neapolitan Mastiff

The Neapolitan Mastiff or Italian Mastiff, () is a large, ancient dog breed. This large breed is often used as a guard dog and family protector. Despite their looks, they are a big gentle dog with family and friends. They can be trained as guard dogs to protect people or property. Neapolitan Mastiffs need a lot of daily exercise. They are directly descended from the Tibetan Mastiff, one of the oldest dog breeds.

According to American Kennel Club (AKC) standards, male Neapolitan Mastiffs should measure 26–31 inches (66–79 cm) at the withers. They should weigh 130–155 pounds (60-70 kg). Females should measure 24–29 inches (61–74 cm). They should weigh 110–130 pounds (50–60 kg). Body length should be 10–15% greater than height.

Banu Hilal

The Banu Hilal () was a group of Nomadic Arabs. In the 11th century they migrated from Upper Egypt into what is now Tunisia and eastern Algeria. They defeated the Berbers. 

Oral tradition says that the tribe would have left Arabia to go to Egypt. According to their legend they rebelled against the Caliph of Baghdad in the second half of the 10th century. In 1049, when the Zirid ruler of Tunisia rebelled against Egypt, nomads were sent to punish them. Ibn Khaldun, an early Tunisian historian, said they were like "a cloud of locusts" when they invaded Tunisia. The Arab poets told of their many conquests as they moved west. They were defeated in a series of battles during the 12th century by the Moroccan dynasty. Even though it was an oral history, the Banu Hilal were a real tribe. They did come from the Arabian Peninsula. And the Banu Hilal did control much of North Africa for over a century.



Maturity onset diabetes of the young

Maturity onset diabetes of the young, or MODY is any of several hereditary forms of diabetes mellitus caused by gene mutations. The mutations interfere with the making of insulin. MODY is often called monogenic diabetes. MODY 2 and MODY 3 are the most common forms of the disease.

The term "MODY" goes back to around 1964.

In MODY 2, oral medications or insulin may not be needed. In MODY 1 and MODY 3, insulin may be necessary.

Some people with MODY may be obese or overweight.

Misophonia

Misophonia (meaning "hatred of sound") is a rarely diagnosed mental disorder. It is a condition where certain sounds can cause someone to be angry or enraged. The sounds could be as simple as someone chewing food with their mouth open. Other examples include a ballpoint pen clicking (repeatedly), tapping, typing and other common sounds. The disorder has only been identified and named in the last 20 years. According to one sufferer, "It’s like a fight-or-flight response: Your muscles get tense, you’re on edge, your heart races, and you feel the urge to flee". Misophonia is often misdiagnosed as one of several psychological disorders. Sufferers often keep away from trigger sounds. There is no cure but it can be treated.

People with misophonia have different amounts of tolerance for triggering sounds. The presence of misophonia may be determined by specific diagnostic criteria. They all, however, result in anger and irritability. Many also have trouble focusing on normal activities while exposed to triggering sounds.

The cause of misophonia is not know. Some studies say that it affects more than 5% of the population.


O.N.I.F.C.

The album debuted at #2 on the "Billboard" 200. The album featured the singles "Work Hard, Play Hard" and "Remember You".

J1 (Y-DNA)

Haplogroup J1, more fully Y DNA haplogroup J-M267, is a Y chromosome haplogroup found in the Middle East. This means it is found in a group of descendants from a single common ancestor in the father's line. It carries a mutation on the Y chromosome known as M267. This type of mutation is called a SNP, or a single nucleotide polymorphism, a change at one position in a gene's DNA. 

Y chromosomes are passed down from father to son without changing, so an SNP like this shows common ancestry.

The origin of this mutation was between 4,000 and 24,000 years ago.

This mutation followed a previous mutation, which created the haplogroup known as haplogroup J-P209 or simply haplogroup J, and so this makes the Y chromosome the "child" of the older version of the Y chromosome. Haplogroup J arose from a mutation which occurred about 31,700 years ago in Southwest Asia.

Haplogroup

A haplogroup is a group of single chromosomes, or single DNA strands, which share a common ancestor. They have the same mutation in all versions. 

Haplogroups show deep ancestral origins dating back thousands of years.

In human genetics, the haplogroups usually studied are Y-chromosome (Y-DNA) haplogroups and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups. Both can be used to define genetic populations. Y-DNA is passed only from father to son, while mtDNA is passed only from mother to children. Neither recombines, and thus Y-DNA and mtDNA change only by chance mutations with no intermixture between parents' genetic material.

Haplotype

A haplotype is a term in genetics. It is short for haploid genotype. A haplotype is a collection of specific alleles (particular DNA sequences) in a cluster of tightly-linked genes on a chromosome. A cluster is usually inherited together. Put simply, haplotype is a closely-knit group of genes which a child inherits from one parent.

A second meaning of the term haplotype is a set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) usually found together on a single chromatid (of a chromosome pair). So, finding a few alleles of a haplotype sequence identifies all other sites in its region. Such information is very valuable for investigating the genetics of common diseases.

Comparing haplotypes of two or more people shows the degree of genetic relationship between their respective lines. It is done in genetic genealogy projects.

Single nucleotide polymorphism

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, pronounced "snip"; plural "snips") is a DNA sequence variation in a population. A SNP is just a single nucleotide difference in the genome. 

For example, sequenced DNA fragments from two people, AAGCCTA to AAGCTTA, is different in a single nucleotide. In this case we say that there are two "alleles". Almost all common SNPs have only two alleles. SNPs occur most often in regions of the DNA which do not affect the survival of the organism: otherwise they would be weeded out by natural selection. Other factors, like genetic recombination and mutation rate, can also affect SNP density. There are variations between human populations, so a SNP allele that is common in one geographical or ethnic group may be much rarer in another.

These genetic variations between individuals (particularly in non-coding parts of the genome) are sometimes exploited in DNA fingerprinting, which is used in forensic science. Also, these genetic variations cause differences in our susceptibility to disease. The severity of illness and the way our body responds to treatments are also manifestations of genetic variations. For example, a single base mutation in the APOE (apolipoprotein E) gene is associated with a higher risk for Alzheimer's disease.

Myxobacteria

The myxobacteria ("slime bacteria") are a group of bacteria that usuallly live in the soil. They feed on insoluble organic substances. They have very large genomes compared to other bacteria. Myxobacteria are included in the delta group of proteobacteria, a large group of Gram-negative forms.

Myxobacteria move by gliding on the surface. They travel in "swarms" with many cells kept together by intercellular molecular signals. The swarm puts out extracellular enzymes to digest food. This increases feeding efficiency. 

When nutrients are scarce, myxobacterial cells aggregate into "fruiting bodies". These fruiting bodies are different shapes and colours, depending on the species. 

Inside the fruiting bodies, cells develop into rounded myxospores with thick cell walls. These myxospores, like spores in other organisms, survive until nutrients are more plentiful. Then cell growth is restarted with a group (swarm) of myxobacteria, not just isolated cells. Similar life cycles have developed among the amoebae called cellular slime moulds.

Myxobacteria produce a number of biomedically and industrially useful chemicals, such as antibiotics, and export those chemicals outside of the cell. Some myxobacteria are used as model organisms for the study of development. At a molecular level, initiation of fruiting body development is regulated by Pxr sRNA.

Fashion show

A fashion show is an event put on by a fashion designer. It is to show his or her new line of clothing. Often they are held during Fashion week. Fashion shows debuts every season. There are the Spring/Summer and the Fall/Winter seasons. This is where the latest fashion trends are made. The two most influential fashion weeks are Paris Fashion Week and New York Fashion week. Both are semiannual events. The Milan and London are also of global importance.

In a typical fashion show, models walk the catwalk dressed in the clothing created by the designer. Occasionally, fashion shows take the form of installations. This is where the models will pose standing or ting to show the clothing. The order in which each model walks out wearing a specific outfit is usually planned.

Trans man

A trans man (sometimes written as trans-man) is a female-to-male (FTM) transsexual or transgender person. Many people in this group like the name "trans man" over the many medical terms that are out there. Other non-medical names are t-boy, tg-boy and ts-boy.

Trans men were called girls when they were born, but they feel that they really are male. To show their true gender as men, trans men may transition from living as women to living as men. A trans man's transition can include telling family and friends, wearing different clothes, flattening the chest, using a new name, changing legal papers, using medical treatments of testosterone, and changing the body with surgery. Getting medical care can be more difficult for trans men because some doctors will not help them or they cannot afford it. Trans men can also face discrimination because they are transgender.

Not all trans men are straight (attracted to women). Some trans men are gay (attracted to men), bisexual, or asexual. Estimates of how many trans men there are range from 1 in every 30,000 people called girls at birth, to 1 in every 170 people called girls at birth.

Campaign for &quot;santorum&quot; neologism

The campaign for the neologism "santorum" started with a contest held in May 2003 by Dan Savage. Savage is a sex columnist and LGBT rights activist. He asked his readers to create a definition for the word "santorum" in response to then-U.S. Senator Rick Santorum's opinions about homosexuality, and comments about same sex marriage. In his comments, Santorum had stated that "In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be." Savage announced the winning entry, which defined "santorum" as "the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex". He created a web site, "spreadingsantorum.com" (and "santorum.com"), to promote the definition.

In 2010 Savage said he would take the site down if Santorum donated US$5 million plus interest to Freedom to Marry. That group supports legal recognition of same-sex marriages. In September 2011 Santorum asked Google to remove the definition from its search engine index. Google refused. They said that the company does not remove content from search results except in very limited circumstances.

Predicate (grammar)

The predicate in traditional grammar is the second part of a clause or sentence, the first being the subject. A predicate completes an idea about the subject, such as what it does or what it is like.

The predicate provides information about the subject.

The subject NP is shown in green, and the predicate VP in blue.

There is a quite different theory of sentence structure, called dependency structure grammar. This puts the finite verb (= conjugated verb) as the root of all sentence structure. It rejects the binary NP-VP division.

Carol Dempster

Carol Dempster (December 9, 1901 – February 1, 1991) was an American actress. She was a silent movie star who appeared in movies from 1916 through 1926. She married a wealthy banker and retired from the movie industry. In her later years she was famous for her philanthropy.

Dempster was born December 9, 1901 in Duluth, Minnesota. She was the youngest of four children. Her father was John W. Dempster and her mother was Carrie M. (Acker) Dempster. Her father changed careers when Carol was still a baby and moved the family to California.

She studied dance at the Ruth St. Denis dancing school. There she was noticed by movie director D. W. Griffith who used her as a dancer in his movie "Intolerance" (1916). Griffith then gave her a role in "A Romance of Happy Valley" (1919). The movie featured the popular acting team of Robert Herron and Lillian Gish. Dempster's first starring role came in the movie "The Girl Who Stayed at Home" (1919). Lillian Gish was supposed to get the role, but was reportedly "tired" and Griffith cast Dempster instead. Critics gave Dempster only mild praise. Her first solo starring role was in "The Love Flower" (1920). It was at this time critics began comparing her to Lillian Gish. But it was Griffith who directed her to sound like Gish and his other legendary female stars. It was about this time that Dempster became romantically involved with Griffith. Her first non-Griffith movie was in 1922. She starred in "Sherlock Holmes" with John Barrymore. Her movie "Isn't Life Wonderful?" (1924) was well received by critics. She starred in two movies with W. C. Fields for Paramount Pictures, "Sally of the Sawdust" (1925), and "That Royle Girl" (1925). Her best performance may have been in her last movie "The Sorrows of Satan" (1926).

In July 1929 Dempster was scarred in a car accident in California. A month later she married wealthy investment banker Edwin Skinner Larsen at her rural New York home. After the couple traveled to Europe, Dempster announced her retirement from acting. She and her husband lived in La Jolla, California. She died there on February 1, 1991 from heart failure. Carol Dempster was buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park cemetery in Glendale, California. Upon her death, Dempster left $1.6 million USD to the San Diego Museum of Art. The money was to add to the museum's collections of prints and drawings. She and her husband had made several previous gifts to the museum. These included Francisco Zuniga's sculpture "Mother and Daughter Seated" and Thomas Eakins' painting "Elizabeth Crowell and her Dog".

Nancy Kulp

Nancy Kulp (August 28, 1921 – February 3, 1991) was an American actress. She played Miss Jane Hathaway on "The Beverly Hillbillies". She also played Anastasia in the NBC sitcom "It's a Great Life".

50 First Dates

50 First Dates is a 2004 American romantic comedy movie. It was directed by Peter Segal. It was produced by Jack Giarraputo, Steve Golin, and Nancy Juvonen. "50 First Dates" was released on February 13, 2004.

The movie got negative reviews from critics. It has a 44% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Movie critic Roger Ebert gave the movie three out of four stars. He said "The movie is sort of an experiment for Sandler. He reveals the warm side of his personality, and leaves behind the hostility, anger and gross-out humor... The movie doesn't have the complexity and depth of "Groundhog Day"... but as entertainment it's ingratiating and lovable."

Novospassky Monastery

Novospassky Monastery ("New monastery of the Saviour", ), is one of the oldest monasteries in Moscow. The first monastery was built in the 14th century. At that time it was inside the walls of the Kremlin. In 1491 the monastery was moved to new buildings on the banks of the Moskva River. It was called the "new monastery". 

In 1571 and 1591, the wooden buildings were attacked by the Crimean Tatars. In 1612, the Tsar, Michael of Russia, had the monastery completely rebuilt. This included the thick stone walls which made it one of the fortified monasteries on the edge of Moscow. These new stone walls were 7.5 meters high and 2 meters thick. They were 782 meters in length, and included six towers. These are the buildings which are still standing. The bell-tower, one of the tallest in Moscow, and the Sheremetev sepulchre in the church of the Sign, were added in the 18th century,

The monastery was supported by Andrei Kobyla's descendants, including the Sheremetyev and Romanov boyars. They used it as their burial vault. Among the last Romanovs buried in the monastery were Xenia Shestova (the mother of the first Romanov Tsar), Princess Tarakanova (a pretender who claimed to have been the only daughter of Empress Elisabeth) and Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia. 


The monastery was closed in 1918 and used as a prison. The cemetery was removed between 1927 and 1930. For a time it was used as a hospital for alcoholics. In 1968 it became a museum of history and an art restoration institute. In 1991 it was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church.


Hebridean Terrane

The Hebridean Terrane is one of the terranes that form part of the Caledonian orogenic belt in northwest Scotland. Its boundary with the neighbouring Northern Highland Terrane is formed by the Moine Thrust Belt.

The basement rock is formed by Archaean and Paleoproterozoic gneisses of the Lewisian complex. They are overlaid unconformably by the Neoproterozoic Torridonian sediments. This in turn is unconformably overlain by a sequence of Cambro–Ordovician sediments. It formed part of the Laurentian foreland during the Caledonian continental collision.

The Hebridean Terrane is the westernmost strip of mainland Scotland, most of the Inner Hebrides and all of the Outer Hebrides. Similar rocks are also thought to be present on Shetland. They have been proved west and north of the Outer Hebrides by BGS shallow boreholes and hydrocarbon exploration wells. The full extent of this terrane to the west is obscured by the effects of Mesozoic rifting.

Some similar rocks occur in Shetland, which are the northern outpost of the Caledonian orogeny,

List of pharaohs

This is a list of the pharaohs of Ancient Egypt. It starts in the Early Dynastic Period, before 3100 BC. It ends with the Ptolemaic Dynasty, when Egypt became a province of Rome under Augustus in 30 BC.

The dates given are approximate. The list of pharaohs uses the dates of Ancient Egypt, developed by the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology.

There are old lists of pharaohs which have been discovered. These are not complete:

Other lists can be found in Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, and Eratosthenes. Two other lists are not believed to be reliable, these are the work of "the Arabic writers", and the "Book of Sothis".

In the legendary period, there were eight god kings who ruled over Egypt. The Palermo, Turin and Manetho king lists, have different names for the eight god kings.

The god kings were followed by kings who were part god and part human. The old lists are different in naming these rulers.

The Archaic period includes the Early Dynastic Period, when Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt were ruled as separate kingdoms.

Lower Egypt was the northern Nile and the Nile Delta. The list may not be complete:
Upper Egypt was the Nile Valley, south of the Delta. The following list may not be complete (there are many more of uncertain existence):
The First Dynasty ruled from about 3150 to 2890 BC.

In the interregnum between the first and second dynasties, two short lived pharaohs may have reigned :
The Second Dynasty ruled c. 2890–2686 BC.

The Old Kingdom was a peak of civilisation and achievement. This was the first of three so-called "Kingdom" periods which mark the high points of civilization in the Nile Valley. It began when Egypt was ruled by the Third Dynasty through the Sixth Dynasty (2686–2181 BC). Many Egyptologists also include the Memphite Seventh and Eighth Dynasties in the Old Kingdom. The Old Kingdom was followed by a period of disunity called the First Intermediate Period, or as the Egyptians called it, the "first illness."

The royal capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom was at Memphis. This is where Djoser set up his court. The Old Kingdom is known for the large number of pyramids. These were built as tombs for the pharoahs. The Old Kingdom is called ""the Age of the Pyramids"".

The Third Dynasty ruled from 2686 to 2613 BC.
The Fourth Dynasty ruled from 2613 to 2498 BC. It included the pharaohs who had the Great Pyramids built, Khufu (Cheops), Khafra (Chephren) and Menkaura (Mycerinus).
The Fifth Dynasty ruled from 2498 to 2345 BC.
The Sixth Dynasty ruled from 2345 to 2181 BC.
The First Intermediate Period (2181–2060 BC) is between the end of the Old Kingdom and the start of the Middle Kingdom.

The Old Kingdom rapidly collapsed after the death of Pepi II. He had reigned for 94 years, longer than any monarch in history, and died aged 100. The latter years of his reign were marked by inefficiency because of his advanced age.

The Union of the Two Kingdoms fell apart and regional leaders had to cope with the resulting famine.

Around 2160 BC, a new line of pharaohs tried to reunite Lower Egypt from their capital in Herakleopolis Magna. Another line of pharaohs at Thebes was reuniting Upper Egypt and a clash between the two rival dynasties was inevitable.

Around 2055 BC, Mentuhotep II, the son and successor of pharaoh Intef III defeated the Herakleopolitan pharaohs and reunited the Two Lands. This was the start of the Middle Kingdom.

The Seventh and Eighth Dynasties ruled from c. 2181 to c. 2160 BC. Many of the kings only ruled for a short time from Memphis, with Egypt divided into competing regions.
This table is based on the Abydos King List dating to the reign of Seti I, and the Turin canon.

The Ninth Dynasty ruled from 2160 to 2130 BC. The Turin King List has 18 kings in the Ninth and Tenth Dynasties. Of these, twelve names are missing and four are not complete.

The Tenth Dynasty was a local group that ruled over Lower Egypt from 2130 to 2040 BC.

The Eleventh Dynasty was a local group from Upper Egypt that ruled from 2134 to 1991 BC. The 11th dynasty came from a group of Theban nomarchs who served the kings of the 8th, 9th or 10th dynasty.

The successors of Intef the Elder, starting with Mentuhotep I, eventually conquered Egypt under Mentuhotep II.

The Middle Kingdom (2060–1802 BC) started at the end of the First Intermediate Period to the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period. Some scholars include the Eleventh, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Dynasties in the Middle Kingdom. The Middle Kingdom began to trade outside of the kingdom. This opening of trade led to the downfall of the Middle Kingdom, caused by an invasion from the Hyksos.

The second part of the Eleventh Dynasty is considered to be part of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt.

The Twelfth Dynasty ruled from 1991 to 1802 BC. It is considered by later Egyptians to have been their greatest dynasty.
The Second Intermediate Period (1802–1550 BC) was a time of chaos between the end of the Middle Kingdom, and the start of the New Kingdom. During this time, the Hyksos, who later became the Fifteenth Dynasty, arrived in Egypt.

The Thirteenth Dynasty was much weaker than the Twelfth Dynasty, and was unable to hold onto the two lands of Egypt. Either at the start of the dynasty, c. 1805 BC or toward the middle of it in c. 1710 BC, the ruling family in Xois, located in the marshes of the eastern Delta, broke away from the central authority to form the Canaanite Fourteenth Dynasty.

The Hyksos made their first appearance during the reign of Sobekhotep IV. About 1720 BC they took control of the town of Avaris (the modern Tell el-Dab'a/Khata'na), conquering the kingdom of the 14th dynasty. About 1650 BC the Hyksos, perhaps led by Salitis the founder of the Fifteenth Dynasty, conquered Memphis, which ended the 13th dynasty. When the 13th dynasty collapsed, the 16th dynasty to declared its independence in Thebes. It was soon taken over by the Hyksos kings..

When the Hyksos left Upper Egypt, the Egyptian ruling house in Thebes set itself up as the Seventeenth Dynasty. This dynasty under Seqenenre Tao, Kamose and Ahmose, first pharaoh of the New Kingdom, forced the Hyksos out of Egypt and back into Asia

The Thirteenth Dynasty (following the Turin King List) ruled from 1802 to around 1649 BC. Manetho said it lasted for about 154 years. 
The position of the following kings is uncertain:

The Fourteenth Dynasty was a local group from the eastern Delta, based at Avaris. They ruled from either from 1805 BC or c. 1710 BC until around 1650 BC. The dynasty had many rulers with West Semitic names and is believed to have been Canaanite in origin.

The position and identity of the following pharaohs is uncertain:

The Turin King List has extra names, but no other evidence has been found.

The Fifteenth Dynasty was started by the Hyksos people who emerged from the Fertile Crescent. They ruled over much of the Nile region, from 1674 to 1535 BC.

The Second Intermediate Period may include an independent dynasty reigning over Abydos from c. 1650 BC until 1600 BC. There are four known kings in the Abydos Dynasty, the order in which they ruled is unknown:
The Sixteenth Dynasty was a native Theban dynasty. It began during the collapse of the Memphis-based 13th dynasty c. 1650 BC and finally conquered by the Hyksos 15th dynasty c. 1580 BC. The 16th dynasty only ruled over Upper-Egypt.
The 16th Dynasty may have included the pharaohs Sneferankhre Pepi III and Nebmaatre. Their chronological position is uncertain.

The Seventeenth Dynasty was based in Upper Egypt and ruled from 1650 to 1550 BC:
The early 17th Dynasty may also have included Nebmaatre, whose dates are uncertain.

The New Kingdom (1550–1077 BC) includes the Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth dynasty of Egypt, from the 16th to the 11th century BC. It is between the Second Intermediate Period and the Third Intermediate Period.

During the New Kingdom, Egypt's armies were able to capture nearby countries. Egypt controlled Nubia in the south, and held territories in the Near East. Egyptian armies fought with Hittite armies for control of modern-day Syria. During the New Kingdom, Egypt controlled more territory than at any other time in its history.

Two of the best known pharaohs of the New Kingdom are Akhenaten and Ramesses II. Akhenaten, also known as Amenhotep IV, worshipped the god Aten. This is seen as the first monotheistic religion. Ramesses II was a powerful military ruler. He tried to recapture the territories in what is now modern Israel/Palestine, Lebanon and Syria that had been held in the Eighteenth Dynasty. At the Battle of Qadesh he led the Egyptian armies in battle against the Hittite king Muwatalli II.

The Eighteenth Dynasty ruled from c. 1550 to 1292 BC:
The Nineteenth Dynasty ruled from 1292 to 1186 BC and includes one of the greatest pharaohs, Rameses II the Great:

The Twentieth Dynasty ruled from 1190 to 1077 BC:

The Third Intermediate Period (1077–732 BC) marked the end of the New Kingdom. After the collapse of the Egyptian empire, some dynasties of Libyan origin ruled Egypt. This is also known as the Libyan Period.

The Twenty-First Dynasty was based at Tanis and was a relatively weak group. They were rulers of all Egypt, but in practice their influence was limited to Lower Egypt. They ruled from 1069 to 943 BC

The pharaohs of the Twenty-Second Dynasty were Libyans, ruling from around 943 to 728 BC:
The Twenty-Third Dynasty was another Libyan group, based at Herakleopolis and Thebes. They ruled from 837 to c. 735 BC:
Rudamun was succeeded in Thebes by a local ruler: 
Not really a dynasty, the Libu were another group of western nomads from Libya who controlled the western Delta from 805 to 732 BC.

The Twenty-fourth Dynasty was a short-lived rival dynasty in the western Delta (Sais). There were only two Pharaohs, ruling from 732 to 720 BC.

The Late Period runs from 732 BC to Egypt becoming a province of Rome in 30 BC, and includes periods of rule by Nubians, Persians, and Macedonians.

Nubians invaded Lower Egypt and took the throne of Egypt under Piye although they already controlled Thebes and Upper Egypt in the early years of Piye's reign. Piye's conquest of Lower Egypt established the Twenty-fifth Dynasty which ruled until 656 BC.
They were forced from Egypt back into Nubia, where they set up a kingdom at Napata (656–590), and, later, at Meroë (590 BC – 4th century AD).

The Twenty-sixth Dynasty ruled from around 672 to 525 BC.

Egypt was conquered by the Persian Empire in 525 BC and ruled by the Persians until 404 BC. The Achaemenid shahs were the pharaohs in this era, forming a "Twenty-seventh" Dynasty:

The Twenty-eighth Dynasty lasted only six years, from 404 to 398 BC, with one Pharaoh:
The Twenty-ninth Dynasty ruled from 398 to 380 BC:
The Thirtieth Dynasty ruled from 380 until Egypt once more came under Persian rule in 343 BC:
Egypt again came under the control of the Achaemenid Persians. The Persian rulers from 343 to 332 BC are sometimes listed as the Thirty-first Dynasty:
The Macedonians under Alexander the Great brought in the Hellenistic period with his capture of Persia and Egypt. The Argeads ruled from 332 to 309 BC:

The second Hellenistic dynasty, the Ptolemies, ruled Egypt from 305 BC until Egypt became a province of Rome in 30 BC. If two dates overlap, that means there was a co-regency. The most famous member of this dynasty was Cleopatra VII. In modern times she is known simply as Cleopatra. She was the consort of Julius Caesar and after Caesar's death, of Mark Antony, and had children with both of them. Cleopatra tried to create a dynastic and political union between Egypt and Rome. This failed with the assassination of Caesar and the defeat of Mark Antony. Caesarion (Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar) was the last king of the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt. He reigned jointly with his mother Cleopatra VII of Egypt, from September 2, 47 BC. He was the eldest son of Cleopatra VII, and possibly the only son of Julius Caesar, after whom he was named. Between Cleopatra's death on August 12, 30 BC, up to his own death on August 23, 30 BC, he was the sole pharaoh. It is tradition that he was hunted down and killed on the orders of Octavian, who would become the Roman emperor Augustus, but there is no evidence.

Cleopatra VII had affairs with the Roman Dictator Julius Caesar and Roman General Marc Antony. She killed herself when Antony was defeated by Octavian (later be Emperor Augustus). Egypt then became a province of Rome in 30 BC. Roman Emperors were given the title of Pharaoh, although exclusively while in Egypt. One Egyptian king-list lists the Roman Emperors as Pharaohs up to and including Decius. See the list of Roman Emperors.

Defragmentation

Defragmentation is a process that happens with digital files. Files are usually stored in one part. When a disk drive fills up, finding an empty space that is large enough becomes more difficult. When this happens, the file is split into different parts, and each part is stored on a different place in the disk. That process is known as fragmentation. Fragmentation happens because different parts of a file are not stored next to each other. When the file is read, the different parts must be assembled. Fragmented files take longer to assemble. Files that are stored in one part can be read faster. Defragmentation reverses fragmentation and puts the file into one piece.

Defragmentation is the process of rearranging the different parts, so that they are stored next to each other. This is usually done by copying them to a different place on the disk. Defragmentation is relevant to file systems on electromechanical disk drives. To read each part, the head of the hard disk needs to reposition itself to the area where the part is stored.

The problem of defragmentation is that it is takes a long time and in some cases, the file system cannot be changed while it is in progress. For that reason, defragmentation should not be done, when it can be avoided.

There are different kinds of files, some of them are modified more often. It is often a good practice to put them on different partitions, as most Unix-like operating systems do. Also, the design of hard drives has changed over time, which makes the effects of defragmentation less visible.

Media that uses flash memory, such as solid-state disks, do not benefit from defragmentation, as there are no moving parts than need to be re-positioned.

Thelarche

Thelarche means the development of breasts in human females during puberty (sexual development).

Generally, the left breast is the larger of the two. 
This usually begins when girls are about 9. A lump that is a bit hard appears in each breast under the areola, which is the dark ring around the nipple. The lump in one breast may grow before the other one. This is called breast budding. Within 6-12 months, both breasts will have started growing. The swelling can be felt and seen outside the edges of the areolae. About 1 and a half to 2 years after the breasts first start growing, they are close to the shape and size of an adult woman's breasts. The nipple and areola may be on a smaller mound on each breast. This small mound usually goes away when each breast is fully grown. Breast size depends on the body's amount of fat.

It is the Tanner 2 stage of breast development (a scale used to analyze changes in people from childhood to adulthood). The first stage is the non-developed prepubescent state of breasts. Thelarche is usually the first sign of puberty. It usually occurs after age 8, and is the first evidence of puberty in 60% of women. It usually ends at age 13. However, it can sometimes happen earlier. When this happens, it can be by itself (called isolated premature thelarche). It could also be a wider pattern of precocious puberty (sexual development happening too early). 

The process is started by estradiol, the primary female sex hormone. Many young women are not prepared for thelarche, and this may result in stress. Teaching materials on breast development for elementary and middle schools has been suggested to promote breast health by reducing shame.

Gonadarche

Gonadarche refers to the first gonadal changes of puberty. The ovaries in girls and the testes in boys begin to grow and increase the production of the sex steroids.

Law of the excluded middle

The law of the excluded middle is a simple rule of logic. It states that for any proposition, there is no middle ground. Every proposition is either true or false.
For example, "Ginger is a cat" says the fact that Ginger is a cat. If it is true, then its opposite cannot also be true. If Ginger is a cat, then Ginger is not something else.
In mathematics, the law of the excluded middle is a presupposition behind the proof by contradiction. Because of that, those who reject the validity of the law of the excluded middle (for example, the intuitionists) must also reject the validity of proof by contradiction as well.

Okefenokee Swamp

The Okefenokee is a swamp, a National Wildlife Refuge and a U.S. wilderness area. It is a shallow, , peat-filled wetland straddling the Georgia–Florida border in the United States. 

The Okefenokee is the largest "blackwater" swamp in North America. The term Okefenokee in Native American is "land of trembling earth". The swamp was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1974. The Okefenokee Swamp is considered to be one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Georgia. 

The swamp was formed over the past 6,500 years by the build-up of peat in a shallow basin on the edge of an ancient Atlantic coastal terrace, the geological relic of a Pleistocene estuary. 
The swamp is bordered by Trail Ridge, a strip of higher land believed to have formed as coastal dunes or an offshore barrier island. The Suwanee River drains at least 90% of the swamp's watershed southwest towards the Gulf of Mexico. 

Longtime residents of the Okefenokee Swamp, "Swampers", are mostly of English ancestry. Due to their isolation, the Swampers used Elizabethan phrases and syntax well into the twentieth century. The Suwanee Canal was dug across the swamp in the late nineteenth century in a failed attempt to drain the Okefenokee. After the Suwanee Canal Company's bankruptcy, most of the swamp was bought by the Hebard family of Philadelphia, who logged cypress from 1909 to 1927. Several other logging companies ran railroad lines into the swamp until 1942; some remains are visible across swamp waterways. Most of the Okefenokee Swamp is included in the 403,000 acre (1630 km²) Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.

A wildfire begun by a lightning strike near the center of the Refuge on May 5, 2007 eventually merged with another wildfire which began near Waycross, Georgia, on April 16 when a tree fell on a power line. By May 31, more than , or more than 935 square miles, had burned in the region.

Blackwater river

A blackwater river is a river with a deep, slow-moving channel flowing through forested swamps or wetlands. Its colour is caused by the decaying vegetation. As vegetation decays, tannins leach into the water, making a transparent, acidic water that is darkly stained, looking like tea or coffee.

Most rivers in the Amazon Basin and the Southern United States are blackwater rivers. Not all dark rivers are blackwater in that technical sense. Some rivers in temperate regions, which drain or flow through areas of dark black soil, are black due to the color of the soil. These rivers are "black mud rivers" or estuaries.

Blackwater rivers are lower in nutrients than whitewater rivers and have ionic concentrations higher than rainwater. The unique conditions lead to flora and fauna that differ both from whitewater and clearwater rivers.

The classification of Amazonian rivers into black, clear and whitewater was first proposed by Alfred Russel Wallace in 1853.

European green woodpecker

The European green woodpecker ("Picus viridis"), or European green woodpecker, is a member of the woodpecker family Picidae. It occurs in most of Europe and in western Asia. There are four subspecies. All have green upperparts, paler yellowish underparts, and a red crown.

The woodpecker spends much of its time feeding on ants on the ground and does not often 'drum' on trees like other woodpecker species. It is a shy bird but usually draws attention with its loud calls. A nest hole is excavated in a tree; four to six eggs are laid which hatch after 19–20 days.

It gives a loud call known as yaffling.

Old deciduous trees for nesting, and nearby feeding grounds with plenty of ants, is essential. This is usually found in semi-open landscapes with small woodlands, hedges, scattered old trees, edges of forests and floodplain forests. Suitable habitats for foraging include grassland, heaths, plantations, orchards and lawns.


Honeyguide

Honeyguides (family Indicatoridae) are near-passerine birds of the order Piciformes. They are also known as 'indicator birds', or 'honey birds'.

They have an Old World tropical distribution, with most species in Africa and two in Asia. These birds are known for their interaction with humans. One or two species will deliberately lead humans to bee colonies, so that they can feast on the grubs and beeswax that are left behind.

The breeding behavior of eight species in "Indicator" and "Prodotiscus" is known. They are all brood parasites that lay an egg in a nest of another species. Most prefer hole-nesting species, often the related barbets and woodpeckers, but "Prodotiscus" parasitizes cup-nesters such as white-eyes and warblers. Honeyguide nestlings have been known to throw out their host's chicks from the nest. They have hooks on their beaks with which they puncture the hosts' eggs or kill the nestlings.

African honeyguide birds are known to lay their eggs in underground nests of other bee-eating bird species. The honeyguide chicks kill the hatchlings of the host using their needle-sharp beaks just after hatching, much as cuckoo hatchlings do. The honeyguide mother ensures her chick hatches first by internally incubating the egg for an extra day before laying it, so that it has a head start in development compared to the host.

Brood parasitism

Brood parasites are animals, usually birds, which trick other species to raise their young. The best-known example is the cuckoo. Brood parasitism works because the parasite develops faster than the resident eggs, kills its nestmates and turfs them out of the nest. The adult birds cannot tell the difference in the young, and spend their time raising the offspring of another species. In some cases, the parasite has the ability to make the begging cheeps of the host species.

The strength of defences and counter-adaptation rely on the species' ability to evolve. Some host species have very strong rejection defences. This makes the parasitic species evolving to have very close mimicry. But in other species, hosts do not reject the foreign egg. As a result, the parasitic species shows no egg mimicry.

Similar methods are used by some fish and insects.

East London

East London is the northeastern part of London. It is east of the City of London.

It does not have an official definition. The idea has its origins in 1720 as "That part beyond the Tower". By 1950 it was called East London and included all of Greater London east of the City of London and north of the River Thames. This area now makes up the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Hackney, Havering, Newham, Redbridge, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest. It includes one of the highest ethnic minority populations in the country, mostly families of South Asian origin.

The East End of London is a subset of East London, corresponding to areas closer to the ancient City. 

The early development of London eastward was caused by shipping on the River Thames. There were docks and shipbuilding. These industries declined after World War II. Felixstowe is now used as the main container port of southern England. East London is now an area of regeneration. 

Areas further east developed in the Victorian and Edwardian eras following the expansion of the railways in the 19th century. In Tower Hamlets the population peaked in 1891 and growth was restricted to the outer boroughs. By 1971 the population had peaked in every borough and the entire area was experiencing population decline. By the time of the 2011 census this had reversed and every borough had some growth in population.

Many famous places like Spitalfields, Brick Lane and Shoreditch are in East London.

AIDS (MS-DOS)

AIDS is a computer virus that infects .COM and .EXE files. In MS-DOS, the .COM and .EXE files run programs including the operating system. When a computer is infected with this virus, it loads the virus into the computer memory. There, the AIDS virus may infect another .COM or .EXE file each time it is run. AIDS writes on the first 13,952 bytes of an infected executable file. These corrupted files have to be deleted and replaced by non-corrupted backups to remove the virus. 

This virus is also known as the "Hahaha virus" in Europe. IBM calls it the "Taunt virus". When an infected computer starts up, it displays a message, with AIDS covering about half of the screen. The system is then halted. It is impossible to recover the original information of the file on the rewritten part.

Later medieval artists

This a list of later medieval artists. It begins in the 13th century (1200s) and includes famous painters and sculptors.

Each artist is listed with their dates, place of birth, some places that they worked, their media (the type of artwork that they made), one or two most famous works and some art galleries where their works can be seen.

These artists, before the Renaissance, painted in the style of Greek icons. Their paintings were important to the education of many Renaissance painters, and were to be seen in the churches where the Renaissance painters worked, and worshipped. Often an altarpiece by one of these artists was surrounded by frescoes by the Renaissance painters who lived 150 to 200 years later. A famous "Madonna and Child" by Coppo di Marcovaldo stood above the altar where Masaccio, Masolino and Filippo Lippi painted the walls of the Brancacci Chapel. Giotto, who is thought of as the first Renaissance painter, was educated by Cimabue, one of the great masters of the Late Byzantine style.

Proto-Renaissance artists worked before 1400 in Italy when the Renaissance style was slowly developing. 

Artists from many parts of Europe worked in a decorative Gothic style.

Stock (food)

Stock in cooking (cuisine) is a liquid flavoring base for soups and sauces. It is a flavoured liquid preparation, and is the basis of many dishes. 

The ideas go back to Carême, and were simplified by Escoffier. 

A stock is made by simmering animal bones and/or meat, fish, or vegetables in water and/or wine. mirepoix or other aromatics are added for more flavour. Mirepoix is a mixture of onions, carrots, celery, and sometimes other vegetables. Many use ready-made ingredients like Oxo cubes or bouillon cubes. It is possible to make stock more quickly with a pressure cooker.

Fish stock, however, is cooked for only twenty minutes or so. 

Stock lasts for three or four days in the fridge, but can be boiled again, and stored again.

Dish (food)

A dish in gastronomy is a specific food preparation, a "distinct article or variety of food", ready to eat or to be served.

A dish may be served on tableware, or may be eaten in one's hands.

Currying is a technique used in mathematics and computer science that consists of changing a function that takes several arguments into a number of functions that each take one argument. Mathematicians Moses Schönfinkel and Gottlob Frege laid the groundwork for this technique, which is named after Haskell Brooks Curry. Currying is used in Lambda calculus. Some programming languages, such as ML and Haskell say that functions can only have one argument.

Law of noncontradiction

The law of non-contradiction is a rule of logic. It states that if something is true, then the opposite of it is false. For example, if an animal is a cat, the same animal cannot be not a cat. Or, stated in logic, if +p, then not -p, +p cannot be -p at the same time and in the same sense. The law was stated as a principle of mathematical logic by Russell and Whitehead in "Principia Mathematica". 

Ravi Zacharias has said most eastern philosophies reject the law of noncontradiction. The law of non-contradiction is found in ancient Indian logic as a rule in the "Shrauta Sutras", the writing of , and the "Brahma Sutras" attributed to Vyasa. It was later elaborated on by medieval commentators such as Madhvacharya. The idea of noncontradiction is rejected in some strands of Buddhism. 

Dialetheism

Dialetheism is the that some statements can be both true and false at the same time. It is the opposite of the law of noncontradiction (LNC). Because of this dialetheism is completely opposite of what most philosophers call common sense. Graham Priest defines it as believing there can be true contradictions. Priest gives as an example the liar paradox (or liar's paradox). If someone says "everything I say is a lie", then is the statement true or false? In this paradox it can be both.

NKVD prisoner massacres

The NKVD prisoner massacres were a series of mass executions committed by the Soviet NKVD secret police against prisoners in Eastern Europe during World War II.

The victims were mainly from Poland, Ukraine, the Baltic states, Bessarabia and other parts of the Soviet Union. The Red Army was withdrawing ahead of the German invasion in 1941 ("see Operation Barbarossa"). The death toll came to 100,000 or more. There were nearly 9,000 in the Ukrainian SSR, to 20,000–30,000 in occupied eastern Poland, now western Ukraine, to all Tartar prisoners in Crimea among other places. Not all prisoner victims (150,000 of them in total) were murdered; some were transported into the interior, others were abandoned in prisons or managed to escape because the retreating Soviet executioners could not attend to all of them.

Gave de Pau

The Gave de Pau is a river of south-western France. It is a left tributary of the Adour river.

It takes its name from the city Pau, through which it flows. The word gave is a name given to rivers on the mountains in regions of the western Pyrenees; so, Gave de Pau means "the river of Pau" or "the river that flows through Pau". Many other rivers in the region have the word "gave" as part of their names.

The Gave de Pau has a length of about , including the "Gave de Gavarnie", and a drainage basin with an area of approximately .

Its average yearly discharge (volume of water which passes through a section of the river per unit of time) is at Bérenx, in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department.

Average monthly discharge (m/s) at Bérenx
The Gave de Pau starts in the Cirque de Gavarnie, in the "Parc national des Pyrénées" ("Pyrénées National Park"), in the "commune" of Gavarnie, Hautes-Pyrénées department, at an altitude of about . The upper part of the river is known as "Gave de Gavarnie"; the name "Gave de Pau" is given to the river after the Gave de Gavarnie joins the Bastan river at Luz-Saint-Sauveur.

The Gave de Pau receives its main tributary, the Gave d'Oloron, in Peyrehorade and, from there, it is named as "Gaves Réunis" (United Gaves). Finally, it flows, as a left tributary, into the river Adour in the Landes department, at about of altitude.

Atlit Yam

Atlit Yam is an ancient neolithic village off of the coast of Atlit, Israel.

A study by Maria Pareschi of the Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Pisa says that a volcanic collapse of Mount Etna's Eastern flank which happened 8,500 years ago likely caused a 10-storey (40 m or 131 ft) megatsunami that hit and engulfed some of the Mediterranean coastal cities within hours. Scientists point to the sudden abandonment of the village around the same time as more evidence that the tsunami happened.

A stone semicircle was found which contains seven 600-kilogram (1,320 lb) megaliths. There are cup marks carved into the stones and the stones are around a freshwater spring. It is suggested that it was used for a water ritual. In 2008, there were skeletons of a woman and child found, which revealed the earliest known cases of tuberculosis.

Chandra X-ray Observatory

The Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) is a space telescope launched by NASA on July 23, 1999. 

Chandra is sensitive to X-ray sources 100 times fainter than any previous X-ray telescope. This is done by the high angular resolution of its mirrors. Since the Earth's atmosphere absorbs the vast majority of X-rays, Earth-based telescopes cannot detect them. Space-based telescopes are needed to make these observations. Chandra is an Earth satellite in a 64-hour orbit, and its mission is ongoing as of 2021.

Chandra is one of the Great Observatories, with the Hubble Space Telescope, Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (1991–2000), and the Spitzer Space Telescope. The telescope is named after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.

Austrian Airlines

On 17 March 2020, the airline temporarily blocks work as a result of the COVID-19.

Miami International Airport

Miami International Airport (MIA) is the largest airport in passenger and size terms in the US state of Florida. It's historic name was Wilcox Field.

The airport is one of the busiest airports in the United States. This is mainly because of Miami's closeness to all of Florida's tourist attractions, the city's economic activity, and its large Latin American and European population.

These airlines fly to and from Miami: 

Pan American World Airways

Pan American World Airways, or Pan Am, was once the largest airline of the USA. The crash of Pan Am Flight 103 and several other factors led to the airline to stop flying in 1991.

Pan Am was founded in 1926. Its first flights were from Key West, Florida to Havana, Cuba. During the 1920s and 1930s, Pan Am bought several smaller airlines in Central America and South America. These were bought to help Pan Am expand its flights throughout The Americas. Pan Am became the first airline to circumnavigate the world in 1942. By the 1950s, Pan Am had several larger airplanes like the Boeing 377, Douglas DC-6 and the Lockheed Constellation. It went to cities all across the world. In 1959, Pan Am bought its first jet - the Boeing 707. In 1970, Pan Am introduced its first widebody jet - the Boeing 747.

In 1980, Pan Am was combined with National Airlines. This was because Pan Am wanted to fly domestic flights and the government didn't allow it. When Pan Am bought National, it could finally fly domestically. In the 1980s, Pan Am started having many financial problems, having paid too much to buy National Airlines. Pan Am also spent too much money on the new Boeing 747s. The Gulf War of 1990 also caused many problems with Pan Am's transatlantic flights. Pan Am declared bankruptcy in January 1991. Delta Air Lines bought small parts of Pan Am and tried to help it. However, on December 4, 1991 Pan Am stopped flying due to the big financial problems. United Airlines got many of Pan Am's old flights. American Airlines got Pan Am's Miami hub. Pan Am was resurrected twice in 1996 and 1998. 


Joint State Political Directorate

The Joint State Political Directorate (OGPU; ) was the secret police of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1934. It was after the Cheka and before the NKVD. Its official name was the Joint State Political Directorate. 

The OGPU was theoretically supposed to operate with more restraint than the original Bolshevik secret police, the Cheka. The OGPU's powers were greatly increased in 1926, when the Soviet criminal code was amended to include a section on "anti-state terrorism". The law were vaguely written and very broadly interpreted. Even before then, it set up tribunals to try the most exceptional cases of terrorism, usually without calling any witnesses. In time, the OGPU's powers grew even greater than those of the Cheka.

Perhaps its most spectacular success was the Trust Operation of 1924–1925. OGPU agents contacted émigrés in western Europe and pretended to be on a large group working to overthrow the communist regime, known as the "Trust". Exiled Russians gave the Trust large sums of money and supplies, as did foreign intelligence agencies. The Trust finally succeeded in luring one of the leading anti-Communist operators, Sidney Reilly, into Russia to meet with the Trust. Once he was in Russia, he was captured and killed. It was a great propaganda success.

From 1927 to 1929, the OGPU engaged in intensive investigations of an opposition coup. Stalin soon made a public decree that any and all opposition views should be considered dangerous and gave the GPU the authority to seek out hostile elements. There were many trials during Stalin's Five Year Plan. 

The OGPU was responsible for the creation of the Gulag system. It also became the Soviet government's arm for the persecution of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Greek Catholics, the Latin Catholics, Islam and other religious organizations. The OGPU was also the main secret police agency for the detection, arrest, and liquidation of anarchists and other dissident left-wing factions in the early Soviet Union.

The OGPU was merged into the newly created all-union People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) in July 1934. Its last change was into the more widely known Committee for State Security (KGB).

Black Sabbath (song)

"Black Sabbath" is a song by the English heavy metal band Black Sabbath, written in 1969 and released on their self-titled first album. In 1970, the song appeared as an A-side on a four-track 12-inch single, with "The Wizard" also on the A-side and "Evil Woman" and "Sleeping Village" on the B-side, on the Philips Records label Vertigo. In Japan and the Philippines, a 7-inch single on the Philips label was released with "Evil Woman, Don't Play Your Games with Me" on the A-side and "Black Sabbath" on the B-side.
Ice-T sampled the song on his 1989 song "Shut Up, Be Happy" and his 1991 song "Midnight". Other musicians have done covers of this song. One of them was Beth Gibbons of Portishead.

According to the band, the song was inspired by an experience that bassist Geezer Butler had in the days of Earth. Butler had recently become obsessed with the occult,so he painted his apartment matte black and placed several inverted crucifixes and pictures of Satan on the walls. Ozzy Osbourne gave Butler a black occult book as a gift. It was written in Latin and decorated with numerous pictures of Satan. Butler read the book and then placed it on a shelf beside his bed before going to sleep. When he woke up, he claims he saw a large black figure standing at the end of his bed, staring at him. The figure vanished and Butler ran to the shelf where he had placed the book earlier, but the book was gone. Butler related this story to Osbourne, who then wrote the lyrics to the song based on Butler's experience. The song starts with the lyrics:

"What is this that stands before me?"

"Figure in black which points at me."

A version of this song from Black Sabbath's first demo exists on the Ozzy Osbourne compilation album "The Ozzman Cometh". The song has an extra verse with additional vocals before the bridge. The guitar and bass are tuned down one whole step, resulting in the key position of A being played on the fretboard, but having the pitch as G (octave - D flat) to the listener. It's one of the band's most frequently performed tracks, being featured on every single tour of their career.

Prisoner's dilemma

The prisoner's dilemma is a paradox about co-operation. It shows why two "rational" individuals might not co-operate, even if it seems in their best interests. It is studied in game theory.

The police catch two criminals after they committed a crime. The police do not know which person committed the crime and which person just helped. They question the two in separate cells. Each prisoner can either stay silent or betray (hurt) the other by blaming the crime on them. If both stay silent, they only go to jail for 2 years. If one betrays and the other stays silent, the one that stays silent goes to jail for 10 years and the other one does not go to jail at all. If they both betray each other, they each go to jail for 5 years. No matter what happens, the prisoners will never see each other again.

If you are a prisoner in this situation and you care only about yourself, the way to get the smallest sentence is to betray the other prisoner. No matter what, you get a shorter sentence when you betray than when you do not.

If the other prisoner stays silent and does not betray, then betraying means you do not go to jail at all instead of going to jail for 6 months.

If the other prisoner betrays, then betraying lets you go to jail for 5 years instead of 10 years. In other words, it's always best for you to betray, even though the two of you would be better off if you both stayed silent. Betraying the other prisoner is your "dominant strategy" because it is always the best thing for you to do, no matter what the other prisoner does.

The prisoner's dilemma does not have same result if some of the details are different.

Game theory was much studied during the Cold War period. In that case the "players" being studied were the United States and the Soviet Union.

Cædmon's Hymn

Cædmon's "Hymn" is a short Old English poem originally composed by Cædmon. It was about God. It survives in a Latin translation by Bede in his "Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum" and in other dialects written down in several manuscripts of Bede's "Historia". Bede wrote about the poet and his work in the fourth book of his "Historia". 

Bede told the story of Cædmon who was an illiterate cow-herder who was suddenly able to recite a Christian song of creation in Old English verse. This miracle happened after Cædmon left a feast when they were passing a harp around for all to sing a song. He left the hall after feeling ashamed that he could not contribute a song. Later in a dream he said a man appeared to him and asked him to sing a song. Cædmon responded that he could not sing. But the man told him that he could and asked him to “Sing to me the beginning of all things.” Cædmon was then able to sing verses and words that he had not heard of before. Cædmon then reported his experience first to a steward then to Hild the abbess. She invited scholars to evaluate Cædmon’s gift. Cædmon was sent home to turn more divine doctrine into song. The abbess was so impressed with the success of his gift that she told him to become a monk. Cædmon lived a long and very productive life as a monk. He created songs from all kinds of Church history and doctrine.

The text has been set to music by a number of composers of choral music. Graham Keitch used Bede's translation for a motet which was commissioned to mark the 1100th anniversary of the death of the Anglo Saxon queen, Aethelflaed. It was first sung during the commemorative Evensong for Queen Aethelflaed which took place in Gloucester Cathedral, June 12th 2018.

Appeal

In law, an appeal is how legal cases are reviewed. An appeal is made to a higher court than the one that made the initial judgment. This is usually an appeals court. In turn, appeals court decisions may be appealed in a supreme court. The person pursuing an appeal is called an appellant.

When a lower court judgement is filed, the losing party (appellant) must file a notice of appeal. The appellant must give the appeals court legal reasons for reversing the decision of the lower court. Usually the legal argument includes legal precedents that relate to this case. The other party, called a respondent or appellee files a brief that counters the claims of the appellant. In turn, the appellant may counter the response of the appellee with a final brief. Then, if the appeals court agrees to hear the case each party argues their case before the court. The appeals court may sustain the original court ruling. They may also reverse the decision sending it back to the lower court. No new evidence is introduced in an appeals court.

It shows the story as a book being read by a grandfather (Peter Falk) to his sick grandson (Fred Savage).

The movie was first released in the United States on September 25, 1987. It was liked by critics at the time. The movie was only a small success at the box office. Over time, it became a more popular. "The Princess Bride" is said to be one of the best movies of 1987. It has been included on many lists of best films. In 2016, the movie was added to the National Film Registry. It was said to be "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant". 

A grandfather visits his grandson, who is sick and must stay at home. The grandfather reads him a story, and says it is full of fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, and miracles. The grandson does not believe it will be good but agrees to try and stay awake, and sometimes interrupts as his grandfather tells the story. 

A beautiful young woman named Buttercup lives on a farm, in a land called Florin. Whenever she tells the farmhand Westley to do some work, he always does the work and his only answer is "As you wish." She eventually realizes that he truly means "I love you" and she realizes that she loves him too. He is poor and they do not have enough money to get married. He leaves to seek his fortune, but his ship is attacked by a famous pirate, the Dread Pirate Roberts, who is known for never taking prisoners, and Westley is believed dead.

Five years later, Buttercup is forced to marriage Prince Humperdinck, the prince of Florin. Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by three outlaws: a short Sicilian boss named Vizzini, a giant from Greenland named Fezzik, and a Spanish fencing master named Inigo Montoya, who seeks revenge against a six-fingered man who killed his father. Soon the outlaws are pursued by a masked man in black, and also by Prince Humperdinck and his soldiers. 

The man in black catches up to the outlaws at the top of the Cliffs of Insanity. He defeats Inigo in a sword fight and knocks him unconscious. He wrestles the giant Fezzik, and put him to sleep using a choke hold. He outsmarts Vizzini, tricking him into drinking from a cup containing poison. He takes Buttercup prisoner and they flee. They stop to rest near the top of steep hill. Buttercup guesses that he is the famous Dread Pirate Roberts, and is angry with him for killing Westley. Buttercup sees Humperdinck and his soldier in the distance and pushes Roberts down the hill and wishes death upon him. As he tumbles down, he shouts, "As you wish!" Buttercup realizes Westley was pretending to be the Dread Pirate Roberts, and she throws herself down the hill after him and they are reunited. Westley explains the Dread Pirate Roberts is not one person, but a name passed on when the pirate wants to retire. They must pass through the dangerous Fire Swamp, and avoid hungry animals that live there. They survive the fires and the rodents of unusual size (ROUS), but are captured as they leave by prince Humperdinck and his cruel assistant Count Rugen, who has six fingers on each hand. Buttercup agrees to return with Humperdinck in exchange for Westley's release. Humperdinck secretly orders Rugen to lock Westley in his torture chamber, the Pit of Despair.

When Buttercup expresses unhappiness at marrying Humperdinck, he promises to search for Westley. His real plan all along had been to start war with the neighboring country of Guilder by making it look like they had killed Buttercup. Meanwhile, Inigo and Fezzik reunite after Humperdinck orders the thieves arrested in the nearby forest, and Fezzik tells Inigo about Rugen. Inigo decides that they need Westley's help to get into the castle. Buttercup is sad and angry with Humperdinck when she learns that he has not tried to find Westley. Humperdinck locks Buttercup in her room, and tortures Westley to death. In the forest Inigo and Fezzik are able to hear Westley cry out in pain, as he dies. They find Westley's body and bring him to a folk healer, called Miracle Max. Max used to work for the king of Florin but was fired by Humperdinck, and at first says he cannot help but agrees because he does not like Humperdinck. He discovers that Westley is not dead but only "mostly dead" because of his true love for Buttercup. Max brings Westley back to life, but Westley cannot move his body, and needs more time to recover. 

After Westley, Inigo and Fezzik get inside the castle, Humperdinck is scared and tries to finish the wedding quickly. Inigo finds and Rugen the six-fingered man who killed his father. He fights him in a duel to the death, saying to him again and again: "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." Westley finds Buttercup, who was about to kill herself, and tells her the marriage was not real because she never said "I do". Still unable to move, he wastes time and tells Humperdinck all the terrible things he will do to him if they fight. His bluff works and without fighting Humperdinck gives up. Together the leave the castle, Westley rides away with Buttercup, and Inigo and Fezzik. Westley and Buttercup share a kiss. 

The boy asks his grandfather to read the story to him again the next day, to which the grandfather replies, "As you wish."

Deltoid muscle

The deltoid muscle is the muscle forming the rounded contour of the human shoulder. Electromyography suggests that it is at least seven groups that can be independently coordinated by the central nervous system.

Grass snake

The grass snake ("Natrix") is a non-venomous snake. It is often found near water and feeds almost exclusively on amphibia and lizards.

The grass snake is widely distributed in mainland Europe, from mid Scandinavia to southern Italy. It is also found in Middle East and northwestern Africa. 

There is a native species in Great Britain but it is not "Natrix natrix". It is "Natrix helvetica" the barred grass snake. The two subspecies were both called "Natrix natrix" until recently (2017).

Work by the Senckenberg Research Institute in Germany lead a study into the genetics of over 1,600 grass snakes.

Smooth snake

The smooth snake ("Coronella austriaca"). is found in Britain, where it lives only in southern heathlands.

It is a non-venomous colubrid species found in northern and central Europe, and as far east as northern Iran. In contrast to many other snakes, their scales are flat (not keeled). This gives the snake a smooth texture to the touch, from which it gets its common name.

The smooth snake feeds on smaller animals, especially other reptiles. It subdues larger prey by constriction, although unlike true constrictors it does not actually kill by this method. It reproduces by laying eggs, which are buried in sand in a warm place.

People objected, and people didn't want to fight it..." As for the song itself, he concluded, "That's a kind of end-of-the-world song, really. It's apocalypse; the whole record's like that."

Crossbill

The crossbills are a genus, "Loxia", of birds in the finch family (Fringillidae). There are three to five (or possibly many more) species. 

These birds have mandibles with crossed tips, which gives the group its English name. Adult males tend to be red or orange in colour, and females green or yellow, but there is much variation.

Crossbills are specialist feeders on conifer cones. The unusual bill shape is an adaptation to get seeds from cones. These birds are typically found in higher northern hemisphere latitudes, where their food sources grow. They move ("erupt") out of the breeding range if the cone crop fails. Crossbills breed very early in the year, often in winter months. This is the time to get the most cones.

They put their beak slightly open between the scales of conifer cones. Then they close their beaks and the tips push the scales apart. This lets them get at the seed (usually two seeds per scale). The point is that, as cones mature, they tend to open when dry and close when wet.
Eventually they fall, and lie on the ground. As they dry the scales naturally open, and any animal can get at the seeds. With their beaks, crossbills can get at the seeds much earlier than any other animal.

Each species' bill shape is optimised for opening seeds from different species of conifer. Their preferred food sources are:


The relationships between crossbill species has been much studied.

Five Nights at Freddy's 3

The game was released on Steam on March 2, 2015, then for Android devices on March 7, 2015. The game is set 30 years after "Five Nights at Freddy's".

The player assumes the role of a newly hired employee at Fazbear's Fright, a horror-themed amusement park attraction that pays homage to the original Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. In addition, the player must monitor the status of three operating systems - cameras, audio, and ventilation - and reboot them whenever they begin to malfunction. They have to defend from Springtrap and the 'phantoms', which are more ghostly and burnt-looking versions of the animatronics from the previous games, including Golden Freddy, Chica, Withered Foxy, Balloon Boy, Mangle, and Phantom Puppet. These animatronics cannot physically hurt you, but every time they catch you, one of the systems then needs to be rebooted. While Phantom Mangle does not jumpscare directly, it can appear in the hall or on one of the cameras and emit a garbled static sound, causing the audio system to have to be rebooted. The only animatronic that can cause a game over is Sprintrap, the main antagonist, and he is attracted to sound. The only way to get him to not kill you is by playing audio of Balloon Boy laughing from "Five Nights at Freddy's 2." If you play this audio on a camera close to Springtrap, Springtrap will go towards it. He is also attracted to Mangle's loud garbled audio sounds, so if Mangle is in the hallway making noise, he will go towards your office faster.

Once we've drawn our lines, once we've made it absolutely clear that 2001 continues to stand absolutely alone as one of the greatest movies ever made, once we have freed 2010 of the comparisons with Kubrick's masterpiece, what we are left with is a good-looking, sharp-edged, entertaining, exciting space opera".

Kimberlite

Kimberlite is an igneous rock best known for sometimes containing diamonds. It is named after the town of Kimberley in South Africa. The discovery of a big diamond in 1871 started a "diamond rush". This resulted in the Big Hole, a large open mine.

Kimberlite occurs in the Earth's crust in vertical structures known as "pipes" as well as igneous dykes and sills. Kimberlite pipes are the most important source of mined diamonds today. Kimberlites form deep with the Earth's mantle. Formation occurs at depths between Kimberlite material is erupted rapidly and violently, often with considerable carbon dioxide and other volatile components. 

Kimberlite has attracted attention because it serves as a carrier of diamonds and garnet peridotite mantle xenoliths to the Earth's surface. The study of kimberlite has the potential to provide information about the composition of the lower mantle. Little is known about melting processes at or near the interface between the cratonic continental lithosphere and the underlying convecting asthenospheric mantle.

Chickasaw

The Chickasaw are a Native American people. They are from the Southeastern Woodlands of North America. Before Europeans came to America, they lived in the area of Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. They speak the Chickasaw language. This language is in the Muskogean language family. The Chickasaw are federally recognized as the Chickasaw Nation.

The Chickasaw first lived in western North America. Before the first European contact, they moved to east of the Mississippi River. They settled mostly in what is now northeast Mississippi. They were living here when European explorers and traders came. They had relationships with the French, English and Spanish during the colonial years. The United States considered the Chickasaw one of the Five Civilized Tribes. The tribe had advanced social structures and did many things that European Americans did. The US forced them to sell their land in 1832. They also forced them to move to the Indian Territory (Oklahoma) during the 1830s.

Most Chickasaw now live in Oklahoma. The Chickasaw Nation in Oklahoma is the 13th largest federally recognized tribe in the United States. Its members are related to the Choctaw and share a common history with them. The Chickasaw are divided into two groups: the "Impsaktea" and the "Intcutwalipa". They traditionally followed a system of matrilineal descent. Some property was controlled by women. Leadership in the tribe passed from a mother to her children.

The name "chickasaw" originally belonged to a Chickasaw leader. "Chickasaw" is the English spelling of "Chikashsha" (). This means "rebel" or "comes from Chicsa".

The origin of the Chickasaw is not known for certain. Twentieth-century scholars, such as the archeologist Patricia Galloway, think that the Chickasaw and Choctaw came from the Plaquemine culture and other groups whose ancestors had lived in the Lower Mississippi Valley for thousands of years. The Chickasaw and Choctaw then became distinct peoples in the 17th century. When Europeans first encountered them, the Chickasaw were living in villages in present-day South Carolina and northeastern Mississippi.

The Chickasaw may have been migrants to the area. Their oral history says that they moved from west of the Mississippi River into present-day Mississippi in prehistoric times.

Another version of the Chickasaw creation story is that they came out of the ground at "Nanih Waiya," a great mound built about 300 CE by Woodland peoples.

In 1540 the Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto encountered the ancestors of the Chickasaw and stayed in one of their towns. After various disagreements, the American Indians attacked the De Soto expedition in a nighttime raid, nearly destroying it. The Spanish moved on quickly.

The Chickasaw began to buy guns from the British after the colony of Carolina was founded in 1670. They used these weapons to raid the Choctaw. They captured some members and sold them into Indian slavery to the British. When the Choctaw started buying guns from the French, the slave raids stopped.

Allied with the British, the Chickasaw had battles with the French and the Choctaw in the 18th century, such as in the Battle of Ackia on May 26, 1736. They continued until France was defeated by the British in the Seven Years' War (called the French and Indian War in North America).

After the American Revolutionary War, the Chickasaw were allies of the new United States and fought against the Indians of the old Northwest Territory. The Shawnee and other Northwest Indians were defeated in the Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794.

George Washington (first U.S. President) and Henry Knox (first U.S. Secretary of War) proposed the cultural transformation of Native Americans. Washington believed that Native Americans were equals of white people, but that their society was not as good. He came up with a policy to "civilize" them, and Thomas Jefferson continued it. Washington's plan included impartial justice toward Indians; regulated buying of Indian lands; promotion of experiments to civilize or improve Indian society; and punishing those who violated Indian rights.
The government appointed Indian agents. They lived among the Indians to teach them how to live like whites. In the 19th century, the Chickasaw increasingly adopted European-American practices, as they established schools, adopted yeoman farming practices, converted to Christianity, and built homes in styles like their European-American neighbors.

The Chickasaw signed the Treaty of Hopewell in 1786. This treaty officially recognized peace between the Chickasaw and the United States.

In 1818, the leaders of the Chickasaw signed a treaty giving up all land north of the southern border of Tennessee. The Chickasaw kept a four-square-mile reservation, but were required to lease the land to European immigrants.

The Chickasaw received $3 million U.S. dollars from the United States for their lands east of the Mississippi River. In 1836, the Chickasaw agreed to purchase land in Indian Territory from the Choctaw. They paid the Choctaw $530,000 for the western part of their land. For nearly 30 years, the US did not pay the Chickasaw the $3 million it owed them for their territory in the Southeast.

The Chickasaw gathered at Memphis, Tennessee, on July 4, 1837, with all of their portable assets: belongings, livestock, and enslaved African Americans. Three thousand and one Chickasaw crossed the Mississippi River. During the journey, often called the Trail of Tears by all the Southeast tribes that had to make it, more than 500 Chickasaw died of dysentery and smallpox.

When the Chickasaw reached Indian Territory, the United States merged them with the Choctaw nation. The Chickasaw wrote their own constitution in the 1850s.

The Chickasaw Nation became allies of the Confederate States of America in 1861. They did this because the United States government had forced them off their lands and did not protect them against the Plains tribes in the West. Confederate officials suggested that the American Indian tribes would receive an independent Indian state if the Confederacy won.

At the beginning of the American Civil War, Albert Pike was made the Confederate envoy to Native Americans. He negotiated several treaties, including the Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws in July 1861. The treaty covered many things, such as the sovereignty of the Choctaw and Chickasaw nation, the possibility of citizenship in the Confederate States of America, and a delegate in the House of Representatives of the Confederate States of America. Because the Chickasaw sided with the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War, they had to give up some of their land after the war. The US also freed all the slaves owned by the Chickasaw. Members of the Chickasaw who returned to the United States were given US citizenship.

Because the Chickasaw were on the side of the Confederacy during the Civil War, the United States government made a new peace treaty with them in 1866. It required that they free their slaves and give citizenship to freed slaves who wanted to stay in the Chickasaw Nation. The freed slaves and their descendants became known as the Chickasaw Freedmen. However, the Chickasaw Nation did not give citizenship to the Chickasaw Freedmen. Descendants of the Freedmen continue to live in Oklahoma.

The Chaloklowa Chickasaw Indian People were recognized as a "state-recognized group" by South Carolina in 2005. Their headquarters is in Hemingway, South Carolina. In 2003, they asked the US Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs for federal recognition, but they did not receive it.

In the twentieth century, the Chickasaw became independent from the Choctaw and re-established their government. They are now federally recognized as the Chickasaw Nation. The tribe's government is headquartered in Ada, Oklahoma.

Chiefs have the suffix "-mingo" at the end of their names. For example, "Tishomingo" was the name of a famous Chickasaw chief.

In 2010, the tribe opened the Chickasaw Cultural Center in Sulphur, Oklahoma.

Television station

A television station is a commercial business or organization that transmits their signals directly to television receivers (TV sets). It usually has a studio for making TV shows. Television transmissions can be broadcast using analog television signals or digital television signals. Broadcast television standards are set by the government. These standards vary around the world. Analog television stations usually broadcast their signals on one television channel. Digital television stations broadcast their signals over one or more subchannels.

The term "television stations" is normally applied to earth-based television stations and not to cable television or satellite television broadcasting. Television stations usually require a broadcast license from a government agency. That agency sets the rules which television stations must follow. In the United States, for example, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licenses television channels.

In the United States, stations are normally either "affiliates" or "independants". Affiliates are stations that are a part of a network. Most networks are nation-wide. Affiliates get much of the programs that they broadcast from the network. It is common for affiliates to broadcast the programs it gets from the network during the primetime hours of 8pm to 11pm and broadcast syndicated or local programing during the rest of the day. Local programing often includes local news, weather and traffic reports. Independant station are not a part of a larger network.

For example, KTLA is the CW affiliate in Los Angeles. They broadcast programs that are provided to them by the national network The CW. It also broadcast locally created sports and news programs.

Luxembourg Palace

The Luxembourg Palace (known in French as the Palais du Luxembourg) is a former royal palace in Paris, France. Since 1958 it has been the seat of the French Senate of the Fifth Republic.

The palace was originally built in 1612 by Marie de' Medici on lands she owned. The design was based on buildings from her native Florence. The building is often compared to the far larger Palazzo Pitti where Queen Marie was born in 1575. In 1642, Marie left the Luxembourg to her second and favourite son, Gaston, Duke of Orléans. He called it the "Palais d'Orléans" but it was still known by its original name. Upon Gaston's death, the palace passed to his widow, Marguerite of Lorraine. Then it passed to his elder daughter by his first marriage, La Grande Mademoiselle. In 1660, Anne de Montpensier sold the Luxembourg to her younger half-sister, Élisabeth Marguerite d'Orléans, Duchess of Guise. The Duchess, in turn, gave it to her cousin, king Louis XIV, in 1694. In 1717 Philippe, Duke of Orléans, Regent of France gave the palace to his favourite daughter the Duchess of Berry. The building became infamous for the duchess's parties and sexual activities. She also hosted Peter the great there in 1717. The pregnancies of the young widow make scandal. At the end of March 1719, a new confinement badly prepared by her excesses, goes very badly. On the verge of death, she begs for extreme unction, which the church refuses her. On April 2, she is delivered of a stillborn child. Disgraced by the rumors of this birth, which all Paris talks about, the princess does not recover and dies in July at the castle of La Muette. At the autopsy, the doctors find her pregnant once again.
Sometime after the French Revolution it became a prison. During World War II it was a headquarters for the Luftwaffe.

Assistant Commissioner of Police Jai Dixit (Abhishek Bachchan), a no-nonsense cop, is called onto the case. Dixit seeks the help of a local bike dealer/racer named Ali Akbar Fateh Khan (Uday Chopra) and devises a trap to catch the gang, but it fails. Kabir (John Abraham), the leader of the gang, eventually taunts Dixit, claiming that Dixit can't catch him even if he is right in front of him. He is proven correct, and Dixit's failure apparently causes him to part ways with Ali.
Kabir then lures Ali into his gang as a substitute for Rohit, the gang member who was killed by Dixit. Ali falls in love with Sheena (Esha Deol), another gang member. The gang later goes to Goa to perform one last big heist before disbanding forever. Kabir sets his eyes on the largest casino in all of India. Kabir and his gang swiftly loot the casino on New Year's Eve, but they soon realize that Dixit has led them right into a trap. It is revealed that Ali was working for Dixit the whole time, and a fight ensues.
Kabir manages to escape from Dixit and goes back to the gang's truck, where Ali has kept Sheena bound and gagged. Kabir then viciously beats up Ali for his betrayal, but Ali is saved by Dixit's timely arrival at the scene. The gang flees, except for Sheena, while Dixit and Ali give chase to Kabir. They kill all the other gang members except Kabir, who tries to escape on his bike. He is cornered by Dixit and Ali with nowhere to go. Kabir decides to take his own life rather than let Dixit arrest him, and he rides his bike over the edge of a cliff into the water to his death.

Iris Yassmin Barrios Aguilar

Iris Yassmin Barrios Aguilar is a judge. She was the president of one of Guatemala’s two High Risk Court Tribunals. A High Risk Court Tribunal is a kind of court that has authority in difficult cases. The cases are likely to cause people to become upset because they are related to politics or government.

In 2014, Barrios received an International Women of Courage Award from the United States Department of State.

Barrios was in charge of the trial of Efraín Ríos Montt, who ruled Guatemala with total authority. This trial was the first time a national court tried a former leader of a country for genocide. That trial decided that Montt was responsible for committing the crime of genocide against Ixil Mayans. The trial finished in 2013.

However, on May 20th, 2013, the Constitutional Court of Guatemala decided that the decision was wrong and changed the decision. It ordered the trial to start again, because of a disagreement over the judges. Officials said that Ríos Montt's trial will start again in January 2015.
In April 2014, Barrios' authority as a judge was suspended for a year. This was because of a complaint against her by a lawyer who had a part in the trial of Efrain Rios Montt.

Beatrice Mtetwa

Beatrice Mtetwa is a lawyer from Zimbabwe. She is known internationally because she represents journalists and because she speaks to support press freedom. In 2008, "The New York Times" said she was "Zimbabwe's top human rights lawyer". In 2014, she received an International Women of Courage Award from the U.S. Department of State.

Mtetwa received her LLB (Bachelor of Laws) degree from the University of Botswana and Swaziland in 1981. She spent the next two years working in Swaziland as a prosecuting attorney (a lawyer who is responsible for starting legal cases against people accused of crimes). In 1983, she moved to Zimbabwe. There she worked as a prosecutor until 1989. That year, she went into private practice (a professional business that is not controlled or paid for by the government). She began to limit her business to one subject, the practice of human rights law. In one of her more famous cases, she questioned a section of Zimbabwe's law, the Private Voluntary Organizations Act. She won the case. The law allowed the government to change the group of people who manage or direct non-governmental organizations. She also questioned the results of 37 districts in the parliamentary elections. In a PBS documentary, Mtetwa said the reason for her activism is "not because there is any glory or cash to it and not because I'm trying to antagonize the government... I'm doing it because it's a job that's got to be done".

Mtetwa is especially famous because she defends local and international journalists. In 2003, for example, she got a court order, a formal statement from a court to stop the government from forcing "Guardian" reporter Andrew Meldrum to leave the country. She gave the order to security officials at Harare International Airport only minutes before Meldrum's plane left. She also helped reporters Toby Harnden and Julian Simmonds from London's "Sunday Telegraph" newspaper. They were arrested during the Zimbabwean April parliamentary election. The government said the reporters did not have official approval. The court said they were not guilty. In April 2008, she helped "New York Times" reporter Barry Bearak get out of jail. He was arrested for similar reasons. Mtetwa also defended many local journalists who were in jail before the 2008 Zimbabwean presidential election.

In 2003, police arrested Mtetwa. They said it was for drunk driving. At the police station, they hit her and choked her, or tried to stop her breathing by squeezing her throat. Three hours later, the police let her go, without a formal charge or accusation. For two days after the attack, she could not speak. On the third day, she returned with a folder of medical evidence, and she filed charges against the police officers. Police officers reportedly attacked Mtetwa again in 2007. Police beat Mtetwa and three colleagues, people who work with her, with rubber nightsticks during a protest march. The march was to protest the harassment of Zimbabwe's lawyers.

In an interview with the Committee to Protect Journalists, Mtetwa said how she tries to prevent attacks:

"I think I confront the danger immediately before it happens. I always make sure that if, for instance, I'm called in the middle of the night to a scene that is potentially dangerous, I make sure that there are as many media practitioners as possible, particularly to record what will happen there. And in the glare of cameras I find that people don't want to do what they would want to do. So in a lot of ways I think I've been lucky, and I haven't received as much harassment as one would have expected, or as much as other human rights defenders have had."

In 2005, Mtetwa won the of the Committee to Protect Journalists. The award citation said that "in a country where the law is used as a weapon against independent journalists, Mtetwa has defended journalists and argued for press freedom, all at great personal risk." In 2008, she also won the group's Burton Benjamin Memorial Award for Lifetime Achievement.

Mtetwa received several awards from legal organizations. In 2009, the European Bar Human Rights Institute gave her the Ludovic-Trarieux International Human Rights Prize ("The award given by lawyers to a lawyer"). That award is given each year to a lawyer who, throughout his or her career, has illustrated, by activity or suffering, the defence of human rights in the world. Mtetwa won the 2010 International Human Rights award of the American Bar Association. In 2011, she received the Inamori Ethics Prize from Case Western Reserve University in the US. In 2014, she received the International Women of Courage Award.

St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia, Canada, was the first university to celebrate Mtetwa's many achievements. They gave her an honorary degree in 2013.

Jacqueline Woodson

Jacqueline Woodson is an American writer who has written many successful books for a wide audience.  She gives a voice to those Americans in our community who are sometimes silenced or looked down upon. Ms. Woodson once said, "I feel compelled to write against stereotypes, hoping people will see that some issues know no color, class, sexuality…. I write from the very depths of who I am, and in this place there are all of my identities." Through her quotes and her books she inspires America to take a stand against stereotypes to make our world a better place.

Jacqueline Woodson is the recipient of the 2001 Corretta Scott King Award and a nominee for the 2002 National Book Award. 

2018 Jacqueline Woodson received Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award, the worlds largest prize for people writing childrens and youths literature. 

"Jacqueline Woodson introduces us to resilient young people fighting to find a place where their lives can take root. In language as light as air, she tells stories of resounding richness and depth. Jacqueline Woodson captures a unique poetic note in a daily reality divided between sorrow and hope." Citation of the jury

Jacqueline Woodson was born on February 12, 1963 in the town of Columbus, Ohio. Much of Jacqueline's writing later in life may have been inspired by her childhood.  Her books talk about the struggle to find a place to fit in,  and being accepted in society. In fifth grade she was the editor of her school’s magazine. Her seventh English teacher encouraged her to write, and told her she should pursue her dreams, which may have led to where Ms. Woodson is today.  

Many of Ms. Woodson’s books for older audiences touch on subjects she experienced growing up.  For example, she wrote about her parent’s struggling marriage, her brother’s struggles with homosexuality, and divisions based off of race in America which she had experienced first hand growing up as an African American in the Midwest.  Also, Ms. Woodson addresses the issue of confidence in young girls.  She says: “I write about all girls because I know what happens to self-esteem when we turn twelve, and I hope to show readers the number of ways in which we are strong."  Jacqueline uses her talent for writing and her experiences of the injustices and stereotypes in our country to promote awareness of important issues and give voices to the voiceless. 

Some books she has written include:

Dodie Smith

Dorothy Gladys Smith (born in 1896), commonly known as Dodie Smith, was an English children’s book author and playwright. She is most famous for writing "The 00 and 1 Dalmatians" and "I Capture the Castle", both adapted into famous films. Ms Smith had not intended to be a writer. Her first love was acting but, she once admitted, "I simply wasn't very good."

Smith was born on May 3, 1896 in Whitefield, UK. When she was eighteen years old, her father died, so after that she and her mother lived with her family - her grandparents, three uncles and two aunts, in an old house with a garden leaning towards the Manchester Ship Canal. Both her mother and grandmother wrote and composed. Almost everyone in the household sang and played an instrument (including pianos, a violin, a mandolin, a guitar and a banjo) and one uncle, a nonprofessional but decent actor, was usually rehearsing, preferably with Smith there to give him cues. Although she had liked theater for a while before she could read, it was hearing of her uncle's parts which really sparked her passion for acting and writing plays, especially as the cues she gave to her uncle got longer and longer and, by the age of nine, Smith had written a forty-page play.

Even when her mother described her first play as dull and boring, she did not stop trying to succeed. Soon she became a young actress for many theaters after studying at the London’s Royal Academy of Art. During World War I, Smith went to France to help amuse the soldiers there and also appeared in a performance of John Galsworthy's Pigeon. In 1923, the actress left the theater to work as a buyer for Heal and Son, a furniture company where she remained for the next eight years, writing for the stage in cinema in her free time. Smith first gained recognition as a playwright, going by the name of C. L. Anthony until 1935. In 1931, Smith sold her play Autumn Crocus to one of her old stage directors. Although she had written a screenplay and a stage play before, Autumn Crocus proved to be the work that turned her career around. Call It a Day was the first play Smith wrote under her own name; also proving to be her most financially rewarding piece. Her plays, generally simple comedies about middle-class life, received much praise, both popular and critical. "The ability to recreate detail, to capture the nuances of everyday conversation, to recognize humor in the trivialities of middle-class life marks the dramas of Dodie Smith," wrote Martha Hadsel. "Her critics sometimes found fault with what they considered her superficiality, but most admitted that her plays provided enjoyable entertainment." Hadsel claimed Smith to be "one of the few successful women dramatists in England and America during the first half of the twentieth century."

Information retrieval

Information retrieval is a field of Computer science that looks at how non-trivial data can be obtained from a collection of information resources. Commonly, either a full-text search is done, or the metadata which describes the resources is searched. Depending on the content, there may also be other indices. Information retrieval is about finding existing information; it is different from knowledge discovery in databases which is about finding new relationships between different datasets, which were unknown. 

Techniques from information retrieval are commonly used in internet search engines, but also when looking for information on a subject in a library, or when searching complex content such as images in a database. This kind of content is usually described using metadata. 

When looking for information, the following problems are commonly encountered: 
A system for information retrieval will attach a score to each document returned. This score reflects how well the document matches the query of the user. The documents with the best scores are shown to the user, who has the possibility to refine the query. 

There are different kinds of models that are used in information retrieval



In addition, each model has parameters, which influence its performance. Some of the models make a number of assumption about the data; they were developed for a very special purpose. Using such a model for a different purpose may not yield good results.

In computability theory and computational complexity theory, a decision problem is a question in some formal system with a yes-or-no answer. The answer is dependent on the values of the input parameters. Decision problems typically appear in mathematical questions of decidability, that is, the question of the existence of an effective method to determine the existence of some object or its membership in a set. Some of the most important problems in mathematics are undecidable.

Nothing sounded really aggressive or heavy enough to inspire me to beat it, so I just had to come up with my own shit."

Vocalist Tom Araya had concerns over the lyrics that guitarist Kerry King gave to the song "In the Name of God". King said; "It's like, 'C'mon, man, you're in Slayer. You're the antichrist — you said it yourself on the first album!' You can't draw the line like that. Whether he agrees with it or not, he didn't write it — I wrote it. So you have to say, 'Well, it's just a part of being in this band.' Now Jeff and I, we don't give a fuck. If Jeff wrote something I had a problem with, I would never even raise a fucking finger. I'd be like, 'Fuck yeah, let's do it! Gonna piss someone off? Alright!'"

Nadia Sharmeen

Nadia Sharmeen (Bengali: নাদিয়া শারমীন) is a crime reporter from Bangladesh, who writes news stories about crime. In 2015, Sharmeen received the US State Department's International Women of Courage Award.

In 2014, the global campaign One Billion Rising for Justice used her story to persuade the Bangladeshi government to accept the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). 

From the time she was in Middle School, Nadia Sharmeen wanted to become a journalist. In 2009, she joined the Bangladesh group of news reporters and became a crime reporter.

In 2013 Sharmeen went to a fundamentalist Islamic rally to report about it for Ekushey Television. At the rally, Hefazat-e-Islam activists attacked Sharmeen. The reason for the rally was to demand laws to limit or control the mixing of men and women in the same space, punish atheists, require women to wear headscarves, and other religion-based rules. The Hefazat had a list with 13 demands. They wanted the government to stop supporting the current Women's Policy, which was planned to create gender equality.

Journalists were attacked and tortured in many places in Dhaka and Chittagong. Women garbage collectors were also attacked. Sharmeen's attackers targeted women who did not wear the hijab, or religious head scarf. Nadia said they attacked her, “only because I am a woman”. Fifty or sixty men attacked Sharmeen. They chased Sharmeen and hit her with water bottles and pieces of brick. When Sharmeen fell, other men punched and beat her. Several male reporters and cameramen tried to save Sharmeen. Then they became targets of the mob.

They took Sharmeen to Dhaka Medical College and Hospital for emergency care. When she was better, they moved her to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. Within days, a report was filed with the police. 

By July, 2013, there were still no arrests, so the Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh organization asked the Supreme Court of Bangladesh to help Sharmeen. The court called for arrest of the men who attacked Sharmeen, and said the government was responsible to pay for her medical care. Nearly two years after the attack, no one was identified, and no one was arrested. After Sharmeen got better, she went back to work as a crime reporter for a different news agency, Ekattor TV]. After the attack on Sharmeen, women's rights activists staged several rallies, with the support of various press clubs, the Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association (BNWLA) and other organizations.

One Billion Rising

One Billion Rising is a global movement, started by Eve Ensler, to end rape and sexual violence against women. The "billion" is the number of women who will be raped or beaten in their lifetime. According to the United Nations, the number is one in three women, or about one billion.

The campaign was started by playwright and activist Eve Ensler. Ensler wrote the play "The Vagina Monologues"). She started the organization V-Day. The idea for the organization came from the Todd Akin 'legitimate rape' and pregnancy comment controversy. Ensler was shocked at Akin's statement. She wrote an open letter in answer.

In 2012, the One Billion Rising campaign resulted in the biggest mass global action to end violence against women ever. There were tens of thousands of events.

By September 20, 2012, people from 160 countries had signed up to take part in the campaign.

Around 5,000 organizations joined the campaign. The campaign was supported by religious ministers, movement builders, actors Rosario Dawson and Robert Redford, and Stella Creasy, a British Labour Co-operative politician.

Anoushka Shankar, a classical musician from India, made a video message dedicated to Jyoti Singh. Singh was the Indian student who died in December after she was gang-raped by six men on a Delhi bus. In the video, Shankar said she was abused by a trusted friend of her parents over several years when she was a child. In her message she said she did not believe she will ever recover from the abuse she had suffered: "...as a woman I find I'm frequently living in fear, afraid to walk along at night, afraid to answer a man who asks for the time, afraid I'm going to be judged or treated in ways based on the way I might choose to dress or the make up I might choose to wear, and you know, enough is enough. I'm rising for women like Jyoti, for women like her, with the amazing women of my country I'm rising for the child in me who I don't think will ever fully recover from what happened to her."

On February 14, 2013, there were rallies in more than 190 countries. The one-day event happened after a call for one billion women around the world to join together to dance in a show of group strength. The activities were on the 15th anniversary of the V-Day movement. The word "billion" refers the number that one in three women will be raped or beaten in their lifetime, or about one billion. 

One Billion Rising for Justice was in February 2014. Bollywood Superstar Aamir Khan, who talked about such issues on his TV Show Satyamev Jayate, supported One Billion Rising Campaign in New Delhi. In Los Angeles, a number of events protested violence against women soldiers and prisoners. Many famous people participated, including Jane Fonda, Anne Hathaway, Marisa Tomei, and Dylan McDermott.

In 2015, the name was One Billion Rising Revolution. More than 200 countries planned to participate. In Italy, more than 100 cities planned events. All 34 provinces of Afghanistan planned events.

Kimberlé Crenshaw, famous Critical Race Theory figure and professor at UCLA School of Law and Columbia Law School, supported One Billion Rising to help create awareness of the difficulties girls of color face in New York and Boston schools. These issues include the school-to-prison pipeline, stereotyping, and the difference in suspension reasons and numbers compared to white girls (the rates being 10 times higher than for white girls).

Forgiveness

Forgiveness is the choice that a person makes not to punish or try to get revenge against another person for something bad that the other person did or something that is illegal or immoral. When someone forgives someone else, they stop hating that person. They wish their offender well.
Forgiveness is a mental or spiritual process. It means no longer feeling angry at another person, or at yourself. This could be because of a crime, a sin, an offense, an insult, a difference, an error, a mistake, or a failure. Forgiveness does not require punishment or restitution. It is given without any expectation of compensation. Forgiveness may involve offering an apology. Forgiveness involves the feelings of the person who forgives and their relationship with the person being forgiven. Forgiveness can occur without the person being forgiven ever knowing about it. For example, a person can forgive another person who is dead or who is not seen for a long time. Forgiveness means forgetting offenses. It is sincere and genuine. It does not impose humiliating conditions. It is not motivated by pride. True forgiveness is known by deeds and not by words.

Most world religions include teachings about forgiveness. These teachings form the basis of modern traditions and practices of forgiveness.

In Judaism, if a person causes harm, he or she must go to those he or she has harmed and ask for forgiveness. If he or she sincerely and honestly apologizes to the person who he or she has harmed and tries to rectify the wrong, the wronged person must forgive him or her. 

"Just as I forgive everyone, so may You grant me grace in the eyes of others, that they too forgive me absolutely." —Tefila Zaka

Each year, Jews observe Yom Kippur, or a Day of Atonement. Before Yom Kippur, Jews will ask forgiveness of those they have wronged during the past year (if they have not already done so). During Yom Kippur itself, Jews fast and pray for God's forgiveness for the sins they have made against God in the past year. God can only forgive one for the sins one has committed against God. This is why it is necessary for Jews also to seek forgiveness from those people who they have wronged.

In Christianity, Jesus spoke of the importance of forgiving others, or showing mercy. In the New Testament, there are several examples. 

“Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.” —Matthew 5:7 (NIV) 
“But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also.” —Luke 6:27-29 (NIV) 
“Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.” —Luke 6:36 (NIV) 
“Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.” —Luke 6:37 (NIV)

Jesus used the (Matthew 18:21-35) to say that we should forgive without limits. The Parable of the Prodigal Son is perhaps the best known parable about forgiveness and refers to God's forgiveness for his people.

Islam teaches that Allah is "Al-Ghaffur" ("The Oft-Forgiving") and that Allah is the original source of all forgiveness. Seeking forgiveness from Allah with repentance is a virtue.

There are numerous verses in the Qur'an and the Hadiths that recommend forgiveness. 

"Allah forgives what is past." —Qur'an 5:95

Islam recommends forgiveness between believers, because Allah values forgiveness. However, Islam also allows revenge, to the extent of the harm that was done. 

"The recompense for an injury is an injury equal thereto: but if a person forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from Allah: for Allah loveth not those who do wrong." —Qur'an 42:40

Forgiveness between believers is encouraged, with a promise of reward from Allah.

In the Bahá'í Faith, explains how to be forgiving towards others.

"Love the creatures for the sake of God and not for themselves. You will never become angry or impatient if you love them for the sake of God. Humanity is not perfect. There are imperfections in every human being, and you will always become unhappy if you look toward the people themselves. But if you look toward God, you will love them and be kind to them, for the world of God is the world of perfection and complete mercy. Therefore, do not look at the shortcomings of anybody; see with the sight of forgiveness." —`Abdu'l-Bahá, "The Promulgation of Universal Peace", p. 92

The writings of Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, state that you should "forgive and forget" a person's actions against you, so that you will be forgiven.

In Buddhism, forgiveness prevents harmful thoughts from damaging a person’s mental well-being. Buddhism recognizes that feelings of hatred have a lasting effect on karma. Buddhism encourages thoughts that have a positive effect. 

"In contemplating the law of karma, we realize that it is not a matter of seeking revenge but of practicing mettā and forgiveness, for the victimizer is, truly, the most unfortunate of all." 

When there is resentment, the Buddhist practice is to calmly release them. Buddhism focuses on release from suffering through meditation.

Buddhism questions the emotions that make forgiveness necessary. 

"If we haven’t forgiven, we keep creating an identity around our pain, and that is what is reborn. That is what suffers."

Buddhism emphasizes "mettā" (loving kindness), "karuṇā" (compassion), "mudita" (joy), and "upekkhā" (equanimity), as ways to avoid resentments in the first place. These ideas help to understand suffering in the world, both our own suffering and the suffering of others.

Forgiveness is one of the six cardinal virtues of Hinduism. A person who does not forgive carries baggage of bad memories, negative feelings, and unresolved emotions that affect the present as well as the future. In Hinduism, one must forgive others, and one must also seek forgiveness for wronging someone else.

Hindu epics and ancient literature also discuss forgiveness. For example:

"Forgiveness is virtue; forgiveness is sacrifice; forgiveness is the Vedas; forgiveness is the Shruti; ... forgiveness is holiness; and by forgiveness ... the universe is held together." —Mahabharata, Book 3, Vana Parva, Section XXIX
"Righteousness is the one highest good, forgiveness is the one supreme peace, knowledge is one supreme contentment, and benevolence, one sole happiness." —Mahabharata, Book 5, Udyoga Parva, Section XXXIII
In Hinduism, you seek forgiveness from those you have wronged, and from society at large through charity, purification, fasting, rituals, and meditation. Forgiveness in Hinduism does not require that a person make peace with their offender and it does not rule out reconciliation in some situations. Forgiveness in Hindu philosophy is being compassionate, tender, kind and letting go of the harm or hurt caused by someone or something else. Forgiveness is essential for one to free oneself from negative thoughts, and being able to focus on blissfully living a moral and ethical life ("dharmic" life). In the highest self-realized state, forgiveness becomes essence of one’s personality, where the persecuted person remains unaffected, without agitation, without feeling like a victim, free from anger ("akrodhi").

In Jainism, forgiveness is one of the main virtues that needs to be acquired by the Jains. Forgiveness (or "kṣamāpanā") forms part of one of the ten characteristics of "dharma". Jain texts quote Māhavīra on forgiveness:

By practicing "prāyaṣcitta" (repentance), a soul gets rid of sins, and commits no transgressions; he who correctly practises "prāyaṣcitta" gains the road and the reward of the road, he wins the reward of good conduct. By begging forgiveness he obtains happiness of mind; thereby he acquires a kind disposition towards all kinds of living beings; by this kind disposition he obtains purity of character and freedom from fear.— Māhavīra in "Uttarādhyayana Sūtra" 29:17–18
In the Jain prayer "pratikramana", Jains repeatedly seek forgiveness from various creatures — even from beings like plants and microorganisms that they may have harmed while eating and working.

I ask pardon of all creatures, may all creatures pardon me.
May I have friendship with all beings and enmity with none.
In their daily prayers, Jains seek forgiveness from all creatures:

I seek forgiveness from all those living beings which I may have tortured while walking, coming and going, treading on living organism, seeds, green grass, dew drops, ant hills, moss, live water, live earth, spider web and others. I seek forgiveness from all these living beings, be they — one sensed, two sensed, three sensed, four sensed or five sensed. Which I may have kicked, covered with dust, rubbed with ground, collided with other, turned upside down, tormented, frightened, shifted from one place to another or killed and deprived them of their lives. (By confessing) may I be absolved of all these sins.
Forgiveness is asked by uttering the phrase, "Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ." This phrase means, "May all the evil that has been done be fruitless." On "", Jains greet their friends and relatives saying "micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ" and seeking their forgiveness. Letters are sent and telephone calls are made to friends and relatives asking their forgiveness. There are no arguments or disputes after "samvatsari".

Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions

The BDS movement is a campaign to help Palestinians. The letters BDS stand for "Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions". They help Palestinians by attempting to put economic and political pressure on Israel. They want an end of Israeli occupation of Palestine. The group thinks that they can create a Palestinian state by boycotting the Israeli government. 

The movement may be hurting the Palestinian economy while having little overall effect on the Israeli economy. An example is the Israeli-owned soft drink company SodaStream. Hundreds of Palestinians lost good paying jobs in the West Bank when SodaStream moved its factory to southern Israel. SodaStream denied the move was BDS-related but their profits fell after BDS targeted them. 

The movement has become popular on many US college Campuses. But no US schools have sold any stocks and none are expected to do so . Israel is concerned about the increasing number of American Jews who oppose Israel's policies. Some have even joined BDS campaigns.

Puttin' On the Ritz

"Puttin' On the Ritz" is a popular ballad. It was written by Irving Berlin. He wrote this song in May 1927. It was first published in December 1929. The song lyrics tell people that if they are feeling blue they should go "where fashion sits" and "put on the Ritz." "The Ritz" most likely refers to the Ritz Tower at 465 Park Avenue, New York City. This is a luxury residential building originally built as an apartment hotel just before this song was written. 

The original 78rpm was recorded by Leo Reisman & his Orchestra (Lew Conrad vocals) in New York City on January 20, 1930 and released on Victor records catalog number 22306. Several other artists sang and recorded the song later in 1930, including Fred Astaire who recorded it on March 26, 1930.

In the early 1980s, Taco released a synthpop euro disco-style version of "Puttin' On the Ritz" in 1981 by RCA Records and Peer Studios. His performance consisted of song and tap. It hit #4 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100.

North African Campaign

The North African Campaign was part of the Second World War. It took place in North Africa from 10 June 1940 to 13 May 1943. The campaign in North Africa included fighting in the Egyptian and Libyan Deserts (the Desert War), and in Morocco and Algeria (Operation Torch) and Tunisia (Tunisia Campaign).
There was a see-saw series of battles for the control of Libya and parts of Egypt. The Siege of Tobruk in 1941 was one of the turning points. In the Second Battle of El Alamein British Commonwealth forces under the command of Lieutenant general Bernard Montgomery decisively defeated the Afrika Korps and other Axis forces and pushed them back to Tunisia. 

The late 1942 Allied landings in Operation Torch in North-West Africa was done to mop up the remaining enemy forces. There were battles against Vichy France forces which then changed sides. The Allies suffered a serious defeat at the Battle of the Kasserine Pass. Later, they defeated the Axis forces in southern Tunisia (battle of Mareth), then encircled the remaining Italian & German troops in northern Tunisia and finally forced them to surrender. 

After the fall of Tunis, the last troops to surrender were the Italians of general Messe on May 13, 1943 in the northern Tunisian peninsula of Cape Bon.


Sherman Brothers

The Sherman Brothers were an American songwriting duo that wrote music for musical movies. They were Robert B. Sherman (December 19, 1925 – March 6, 2012) and Richard M. Sherman (born June 12, 1928).

The Sherman Brothers wrote more motion-picture musical song scores than any other songwriting team in movie history. Movie scores of the Sherman Brothers include "Mary Poppins", "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang", "The Jungle Book", "Charlotte's Web" and "The Aristocats".

Sons of Russian Jewish immigrants, Robert and Richard Sherman began writing songs together in 1951 on a challenge from their father, Tin Pan Alley songwriter Al Sherman. The brothers wrote together and with different songwriting partners throughout the rest of the decade.

In 1958 Robert founded the music publishing company Music World Corporation. It later had a relationship with Disney's BMI-affiliated publishing arm, Wonderland Music Company. That same year, the Sherman Brothers had their first top-ten hit with "Tall Paul," sung by Mouseketeer Judy Harriet on the Surf Records label. It was also sung by Mouseketeer Annette Funicello. The success of this song got the attention of Walt Disney. He then hired the Sherman Brothers as Staff Songwriters for Walt Disney Studios. The first song they wrote on personal assignment by Walt Disney was "Strummin' Song" in 1961. It was used in the Annette Funicello made-for-television movie called "The Horsemasters".

While at Disney, the Sherman Brothers wrote more motion-picture musical scores than any other songwriters in the history of movies. They also wrote what is perhaps their best-known song, "it's a small world (after all)" for the 1964 New York World's Fair. Since then, some have claimed that this has become the most translated and performed song on Earth, although this is largely due to the fact that it is played at Disney's theme park "it's a small world" attractions of the same name.

In 1965 the Sherman Brothers won two Academy Awards for "Mary Poppins", which includes the songs "Feed The Birds," "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious," and the Oscar-winning "Chim Chim Cher-ee." Since "Mary Poppins"' first was shown, the Shermans have earned nine Academy Award nominations, two Grammy Awards, four Grammy Award nominations, and 23 gold- and platinum-certified albums.

Robert and Richard Sherman worked directly for Walt Disney, completing the scores for the live-action musical movies "The Happiest Millionaire" and "The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band" until Disney's death in 1966. Since leaving the company, the brothers have worked freelance as songwriters on scores of motion pictures, television shows, theme-park exhibits, and stage musicals.

Their first non-Disney assignment came with Albert R. Broccoli's motion picture production "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" for United Artists in 1968. It got the brothers their third Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song for its particularly memorable titular song.

In 1970, the Shermans returned to Disney for a brief stint where they completed work on "The Aristocats" and "Bedknobs and Broomsticks". The latter movie got the brothers their fourth and fifth Oscar nominations. 1972 saw the release of "Snoopy Come Home", for which the brothers received a Grammy nomination.

In 1973 the Sherman Brothers also made history by becoming the only Americans ever to win First Prize at the Moscow Film Festival for "Tom Sawyer", for which they also authored the screenplay.

In 1976 “The Slipper and the Rose” was picked to be the Royal Command Performance of the year. The performance was attended by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. A modern musical version of the classic Cinderella story, "Slipper", also featured songs, score, and screenplay by the Sherman Brothers. Two further Academy Award nominations were gotten by the brothers for the movie. That same year the Sherman Brothers got their star on the Hollywood "Walk of Fame" directly across from Grauman's Chinese Theater.

The Sherman Brothers' many other Disney and non-Disney top box office movie credits include "The Jungle Book" (1967), "The Aristocats" (1970), "The Parent Trap" (1961), "The Parent Trap" (1998), "Charlotte's Web" (1973), "Huckleberry Finn" (1974),"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh" (1977), "Snoopy, Come Home" (1972), "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" (1971), and "" (1989).

Outside motion-pictures, their Tony Award-nominated smash hit "Over Here!" (1974) was the biggest-grossing original Broadway musical of that year. The Sherman Brothers have also written numerous top selling songs including "You're Sixteen," which reached Billboard's Hot 100 top 10 twice: first with Johnny Burnette in 1960 and then at #1 with Ringo Starr more than thirteen years later. Other top-ten hits include "Pineapple Princess," "Let's Get Together," and more.

In 2000 the Sherman Brothers wrote the song score for the Disney movie "The Tigger Movie". This movie marked the brothers' first major motion picture for the Disney company in over 28 years.

In 2003, four Sherman Brothers' musicals ranked in the Top 10 Favorite Children's Films of All Time in a British nationwide poll reported by the BBC. Most notably, "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" 1968 topped the list at #1.

In later years, with Robert's move to London, the brothers wrote many new songs for the stage musical presentations of "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" and "Mary Poppins", produced by Disney and Cameron Mackintosh.

For their contributions to the motion picture industry, the Sherman brothers have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6918 Hollywood Blvd. They were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on June 9, 2005. On November 16, 2006, "Mary Poppins" premiered at the New Amsterdam Theatre on Broadway.

On November 17, 2008 the Sherman Brothers got the National Medal of Arts which is the highest honor given to artists by the United States Government. The award was presented by United States President George W. Bush in an East Room ceremony at The White House.

On May 22, 2009, "The Boys: the Sherman Brothers’ Story", a movie about the pair, was shown in theatres. The movie was directed and produced by their sons, Gregory V. Sherman and Jeff Sherman. It was put out by Walt Disney Pictures.

In October 2009, Disney released a 59 track, two CD compendium of their work for the studio spanning forty-two years. The CD is titled "The Sherman Brothers Songbook".

On March 11, 2010 the Sherman Brothers were presented with a Window on Mainstreet Disneyland in Anaheim, California, in honor of their contribution to Disney theme parks. On May 17, 2010, the Sherman Brothers received the "Career Achievement Award" at The Theatre Museum's 2010 Awards Gala in New York City.

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is a 1968 British fantasy musical film, loosely based on Ian Fleming's novel "Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang: The Magical Car". The movie's script is by Roald Dahl and Ken Hughes. The songs are by the Sherman Brothers. The song "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" was nominated for an Academy Award.

The film stars Dick Van Dyke as Caractacus Potts, Sally Ann Howes as Truly Scrumptious, Lionel Jeffries as Grandpa Potts, James Robertson Justice as Lord Scrumptious and Robert Helpmann as the Childcatcher. The film was directed by Ken Hughes. It was produced by Albert R. Broccoli (co-producer of the James Bond series of films, also based on Fleming's novels). John Stears supervised the special effects. Irwin Kostal supervised and conducted the music. The musical numbers were staged by Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood.

Baron Bomburst is the main antagonist in the 1968 film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. He is a cruel king and a pirate who will stop at nothing to get his hands on the enchanted car. In spite of being so cruel and tyrannical, it is clear that he is also incredibly childish, as shown by his selfish love of toys, his whiny nature, and his determination to get everything he wants. Incidentally, the book Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was written by James Bond's creator Ian Fleming, and both films were produced by Albert R . Broccoli.
He was portrayed by the late Gert Fröbe, who also played the titular villain Auric Goldfinger of the James Bond film.

Baroness Bomburst is a supporting antagonist and hero in the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and later the stage musical adaptation. The character was created by screenwriter Roald Dahl and did not appear in the original Ian Fleming novel.

In the 1968 film, she is played by Anna Quayle In the theatrical version in London, she was played by Nichola McAuliffe, Sandra Dickinson, and Louise Gold amongst others, and on Broadway, she was played by Jan Maxwell. On the UK National tour, she has been played by (amongst others) Louise Plowright, Jane Gurnett, Kim Ismay, Tamsin Carroll, Michelle Collins, and Claire Sweeney.

First appearing as a gentleman pirate when the Potts and Truly Scrumptious are picnicking on the beach, he reveals a cruel and greedy streak by attempting to steal the enchanted car, and then he orders his men to load cannons, and when The Car floats he wants it even more. But the car escapes much to his disappointment, and seeing that the car is able to float and move like a speedboat on the sea, he sabotages the Potts' home by air and kidnaps Grandfather Potts, mistaking him for the inventor of Chitty.

Later, when the Potts follow Bomburst's airship to his native Vulgaria, they discover how cruelly the Baron treats his subjects. Although it is stated that "the Baroness hates children" and that it is the Baroness who sends for the Child Catcher, it's obvious that the Baron himself hates children as well, and his greed is evident all the more when it is revealed that all the toys made by Vulgaria's toymaker are for him.

Baron Bomburst is last seen when a huge battle occurs in his castle by an ambush lead by Caractacus Potts, Bomburst's loyal servant The Toymaker, the children of the villagers, and Truly Scrumptious. He and his wife cowardly hide from the battle and see lots of children ambush his castle. Wondering where the children are coming from the Bomburst couple summons the Child Catcher but even the Child Catcher is ultimately defeated by the Children and is left hanging from a net in the air. Realizing the Child Catcher is defeated Baroness suggests escaping down a slide. Baron Bomburst at first doesn't like the idea, due to not wanting to get his clothes dirty, but the couple goes down anyway and gets trapped in the Child Catcher's cage-car and the Bomburst couple is defeated. The Villagers help battle the Cavalry and Bomburst gets defeated in the battle. With the Baron and Baroness defeated the Cavalry retreats the battle in terror. Though Vulgaria then becomes a free country, it is completely unknown what happened to the Bomburst couple afterward, but as they did not execute any kid, it is highly likely that they were not executed for their crimes and were either exiled or sent to the very dungeons

Jeremy and Jeremiah Potts got captured by the child catcher, who was disguised as an ice cream man They, along with their father, the toymaker and Truly Scrumptious finally capturing the Child Catcher. Who later appears in the advert or sequel as a minor character who will later appear in the advert but they don't speak ready to take them back to the Baron Bomburst.

The cast includes:


The film was the tenth most popular at the US box office in 1969.

Film critic Roger Ebert reviewed the film ("Chicago Sun-Times", 24 December 1968). He wrote: ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" contains about the best two-hour children's movie you could hope for, with a marvelous magical auto and lots of adventure and a nutty old grandpa and a mean Baron and some funny dances and a couple of [scary] moments."

Film critic and historian Leonard Maltin considered the picture "one big Edsel. He said the movie had a totally forgettable score and some of the shoddiest special effects ever." In 2008, "Entertainment Weekly" called Helpmann's depiction of the Child Catcher one of the "50 Most Vile Movie Villains."

As of March 2014, the film has a 65% "Fresh" rating (17 of 26 reviews) on Rotten Tomatoes.

Germanwings Flight 9525

Germanwings Flight 9525 (4U9525/GWI9525) was a scheduled international passenger flight flying from Barcelona, Spain to Düsseldorf, Germany, operated by the Lufthansa-owned low-cost airline Germanwings. 

On 24 March 2015, the Airbus A320-200 jetliner crashed around northwest of Nice, in the French Alps. All 144 passengers and six crew members were killed.

The crash was a murder-suicide planned and acted out by 27-year old co-pilot Andreas Lubitz.
The plane, which had taken off at 10:01 a.m. from the Barcelona-El Prat airport, disappeared from the radars at 10:39 a.m., when it was at an altitude of 2,000 meters above the department of Alpes de Alta. Provence, in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region.

Telemetry data indicated that, before disappearing from radar, the A320 would have started to fall at 10:31 a.m. and would have lost about 4,000 meters of altitude in four minutes. At first it was thought that the pilots had issued an emergency signal at 10:47, when the plane was at an altitude of 1,500 feet and in an abnormal situation, but it was actually sent by the controllers. In the words of the President of the French Republic, François Hollande, the conditions of the incident suggest that there would be no survivors. Hollande also initially stated that the plane was carrying German, Spanish and Turkish passengers, without specifying whether there were more victims of other nationalities.

The main hypothesis for the cause of the aircraft crash is that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately caused it to crash. The recording of one of the black boxes of the destroyed Airbus allows us to verify that Lubitz activated the closing of the cockpit door and deliberately began the descent of the plane over the mountains. His breathing at the time of descent was normal and he ignored the captain's instructions to open the door, even when the latter tried to knock it down with an ax to regain control of the aircraft.

Opera singers Oleg Bryjak and Maria Radner were passengers on the plane.

Gandhism

Gandhism is a set of ideas that describes the inspiration, vision, and the life work of Mohandas K. Gandhi. It is especially connected with his contributions to the idea of nonviolent resistance, sometimes also called civil resistance.

The word "Gandhism" also includes what Gandhi's ideas, words, and actions mean to people around the world and how they used them for guidance in building their own future.

However, Gandhi did not approve of the term "Gandhism". As he explained:
Without a "Gandhism" approved by Gandhi himself, there is a way of thinking that one has to get what Gandhism stands for, from his life and works. One such deduction is a philosophy based on "truth" and "non-violence" in the following sense. First, one should recognize and accept the truth that people are different at all levels ("truth"). Second, one should never resort to violence to settle built-in differences between human beings at any level: from between two people to two nations to two races or two religions ("non-violence").

Gender performativity

Gender performativity is a term first used by the feminist philosopher Judith Butler in their 1990 book "Gender Trouble". They argue that being born male or female does not determine behavior. Instead, people learn to behave in particular ways to fit into society. The idea of gender is an act, or performance. This act is the way a person walks, talks, dresses, and behaves. They call this acting "gender performativity." What society regards as a person's gender is just a performance made to please social expectations and not a true expression of the person's gender identity.

Angel of Death (song)

"Angel of Death" is a song by American thrash metal band Slayer. It is the opening song to their third studio album, "Reign in Blood". The song was released on October 7, 1986. The song is based on Nazi physician Josef Mengele who worked at the Auschwitz concentration camp and did human experiments. Both the lyrics and music were written by guitarist Jeff Hanneman. 

"Stylus Magazine"'s Clay Jarvas said that the song "smokes the asses of any band playing fast and/or heavy today. Lyrically outlining the horrors to come, while musically laying the groundwork for the rest of the record: fast, lean and filthy."

"Angel of Death" caused controversy and led to accusations that Slayer were Nazi sympathizers. Hanneman said about the controversy: "I know why people misinterpret it – it's because they get this knee–jerk reaction to it. When they read the lyrics, there's nothing I put in the lyrics that says necessarily he was a bad man, because to me – well, isn't that obvious? I shouldn't have to tell you that."

It was launched in 1979 as Air Lanka. The launch was after the end of operations of the original Sri Lankan flag carrier Air Ceylon. Following its partial acquisition in 1998 by Emirates, it was re-branded. In 2008 the government of Sri Lanka acquired all the shares of the airline from Emirates. After ending the Emirates partnership, it retained its re-branded name and logo. Sri Lankan Airlines operates over 560 flights per week.

Emirates bought a 40% stake worth US$70 million (which it later increased to 43.6%) in Air Lanka and sought to refurbish the airline's image and fleet. The government retained a majority stake in the airline. Though they gave full control to Emirates for investment and management decisions. In 1998, the Air Lanka re-branded to SriLankan Airlines.

In 2008, Emirates notified the Sri Lankan Government that it would not renew its management contract, which then expired on 31 March 2008. It claimed that the Sri Lankan Government was seeking greater control over the day-to-day management of the airline. Emirates sold its 43.63% stake in the airline to the in a deal that was finalized in 2010, thus ending any affiliations the two airlines had with each other.
In 2008 when Emirates pulled out, the profit of SriLankan was Rs. 9.288 billion in that financial year. From 2008 to 2015, when the government administration ran it, the loss for the seven years was Rs. 128.238 billion (US$875 million).
Following the ownership transfer, SriLankan took the decision to promote Colombo as a hub for flights to Asia. The first destination of the expansion plan was Shanghai; the route started on 1 July 2010. The airline started flights to Guangzhou on 28 January 2011.

SriLankan joined the Oneworld alliance on 1 May 2014. During 2014 it started to renew and increase its fleet, with purchases of Airbus A330 & A350 models. Currently, SriLankan operates an all-Airbus fleet except for its discontinued Air-Taxi services. SriLankan phased out their last on 7 January 2016 with its last scheduled flight from Chennai to Colombo.

The airline closed three European routes – Frankfurt, Paris and Rome – by end of 2016.

In October 2017, SriLankan launched direct daily non-stop flights to Melbourne, Australia. Its their first new long haul route in over five years. The flights restore a regular direct air link between Australia and Sri Lanka after a hiatus of 16 years.

Stephan's Quintet

Stephan's Quintet is in the constellation Pegasus. It is a visual grouping of five galaxies of which four are the first compact galaxy group ever discovered. The group is about 280 million light years from Earth.

The group was discovered by Édouard Stephan in 1877 at Marseille Observatory.
The group is the most studied of all the compact galaxy groups. The brightest member of the visual grouping is NGC 7320. This has extensive H II regions, seen here as red blobs, where active star formation is occurring.

These galaxies are of interest because of their violent collisions. Four of the five galaxies in Stephan's Quintet form a physical association, Hickson Compact Group 92. They are involved in a cosmic dance that will probably end with the galaxies merging. 

Radio observations in the early 1970s showed a mysterious emission from the inter-galactic space between the galaxies in the group. This same region also showed faint glow of ionized atomic hydrogen. You can see this in the visible part of the spectrum as the magnificent green-blue arc in the picture to the right. Two space telescopes have recently shown something about the nature of the strange filament. It is now believed to be a giant intergalactic shock-wave (similar to a sonic boom but travelling in intergalactic gas rather than air). This is caused by one galaxy (NGC 7318B) falling into the center of the group at several million miles per hour.

The light blue galaxy NGC 7320 is a foreground galaxy, only 40 million light years from Earth.

Kimmo Samuel Timonen (born March 18, 1975) is a Finnish professional ice hockey defenceman. He currently plays for the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has also played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Nashville Predators and Philadelphia Flyers.

Before playing in the NHL, Timonen played parts of 7 years in the SM-liiga with KalPa, TPS, and HIFK.

He was drafted 250th overall by the Los Angeles Kings in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft. He continued to play in the SM-liiga after the draft. He helped Finland win the bronze medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano. A little while after the Olympics, the Kings traded Timonen along with Jan Vopat to the Nashville Predators (who did not begin playing yet) in agreement that the Predators would not draft Garry Galley in the 1998 NHL Expansion Draft.

Timonen would spend time between the Predators and their IHL affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals. He was called up to the Predators during 1999-2000 season. He played the next four seasons with the Predators before the 2004–05 NHL lockout. He decided to travel back to Finland and play for KalPa during the lockout. On October 3, 2006, the Predators named Timonen the captain for the 2006–07 season.

On June 18, 2007, the Predators traded Timonen along with Scott Hartnell to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for Philadelphia's first round pick (Jonathon Blum) in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft. After he signed, he became the highest paid Finn in the NHL after he signed a six-year, $37.8 million contract extension.

Timonen and the Flyers faced the Washington Capitals in the first round of the playoffs. Philadelphia was able to win the series 4–3. In the second round of the playoffs, the Flyers played against the Montreal Canadiens and won the series 4–1. On April 30, 2008, Timonen was hit by a wrist shot at his foot by Canadiens defenseman Andrei Markov. He said that he had felt numbness in his foot but he didn't think it was anything but a twisted nerve. On May 8, 2008, a doctor at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania who looked at Timonen's foot said that he had found a small blood clot. This stopped Timonen from playing indefinitely and he missed the first four games of the Eastern Conference Finals against the rival Pittsburgh Penguins. He returned in game 5 but the Flyers lost and they were eliminated from the playoffs. On March 5, 2011, Timonen scored his 100th career goal against Ryan Miller of the Buffalo Sabres in a 5–3 loss. On August 5, 2014, Timonen was diagnosed with blood clots in his right leg and both of his lungs. He was ruled out from playing indefinitely and missed the first 62 games of the season.

On February 27, 2015, the Flyers traded Timonen to the Chicago Blackhawks in exchange for a 2015 second-round pick and 2016 fourth-round pick.

Pelvic inflammatory disease

Pelvic inflammatory disease or PID is an infection. It is an infection of the female organs: uterus. fallopian tubes, cervix, and ovaries. PID can cause a women not being able to have a baby. It can cause a baby to grow outside of the womb and pelvic pain. Sometimes the woman does not feel sick. The infection is caused by bacteria. Sexually transmitted infections can cause pelvic inflammatory disease. The infection is from having sex with some one who has the infection. One in 8 women with a history of PID may have a problem getting pregnant. 
A woman with PID can feel sick. But sometimes a woman with PID does not feel sick. A woman with PID can have a fever, She can have pain when the belly is touched, painful sex, or unusual bleeding. The signs of being sick with PID can be:

If this illness is not treated it can prevent a woman from having children. It can kill the unborn child and it can be very painful. This disease can be treated and the infection can be cured. PID is treated by a doctor with antibiotic medication.
The infection is caused by microorganisms that enter the body through the vagina during sex. The bacteria travel up thorough the uterus and into the inside of the body. There are many microorganisms that cause infection in this way, such as:

Medical workers use different tests to find the infection. They can perform a medical exam to see evidence of pus and find painful areas. They can use a microscope to see the microorganisms causing the infection. A blood test can detect PID. Two thirds of women were not aware they had PID. Even with no signs of infection, PID can cause serious harm.

Other things can cause the same infection as PID. This could be a complicated pregnancy, appendicitis, swollen or twisted ovaries, and endometriosis. A woman is more likely to get Pelvic inflammatory disease if she has had it before. She is more likely to have the infection if she has recently had sex, started menstruation, had an Intrauterine device put inside her uterus or if her sex partner has a sexually transmitted infection.

Medical testing for sexually transmitted infections is important for prevention. The chance of getting PID can be made less by:

If your medical provider thinks you are infected, treatment is usually started right away. Serious results may happen from delayed treatment. Sometimes the medical provider will use a test to help find the infection. Curing the infection with antibiotic medications is normal. Treating sex partners for possible infections will help in treatment and prevention of getting the infection again.

If the women does not get treated, the infection can get worse. Then many things will happen. If this infection is found early, treatment can begin, and the problems can be prevented. Some of the bad things that can happen with PID are blocked fallopian tubes and internal scar tissue. The woman could have a baby grow outside the womb. There could be much pain in the belly.

Even when the PID infection is cured, the damage from the infection may not go away. This makes finding the infection important. Treatment by medical providers can prevent damage to the female reproductive organs.

CIH

CIH (also known as Chernobyl or Spacefiller) is a Windows 9x computer virus which first appeared in 1998. It was created by Chen Ing-hau, a Chinese student. The name it was given is based on his initials. After the virus is run on April 26, it will start adding random data to files on the hard drive. On some computers it will also corrupt the BIOS. This will leave the computer unable to operate until the hard drive is recovered with data recovery software and the BIOS is manually reflashed. It does not infect Windows NT computers. It resulted in over 1 billion USD worth in damages. In 1999, IBM shipped some of their Aptiva computers with the virus already on the computer. Some games, like Activision's SiN and Electronic Arts' Wing Commander came with the virus.

CryptoLocker

CryptoLocker is a file encrypting ransomware. It first appeared in September 2013. It was transferred using email attachments and botnets. The ransomware encrypts most files on the computer (including connected devices), using an RSA encryption.After infection Cryptolocker scan the victim’s folder structure for files matching a set of file extensions, encrypt them and display a message window that demands a ransom in order to decrypt the files. Cryptolocker use RSA public-key cryptography. Once it has encrypted the files, it will display a window asking for 2 Bitcoin for the decryption program. It will give the user 72 hours to pay the ransom.

If the user does not pay the fee in time, the ransomware will uninstall itself and ask the user to download it again. It will then ask the user for 10 Bitcoin, instead of 2. A program to decrypt (fix) files was later made available.

Ransomware

Ransomware is a type of malware. It restricts access to the computer system that it infects all the data that it stores (often using encryption techniques), and demands a ransom be paid to the creator(s) of the malware. This is in order for the restriction to be removed. Some forms of Ransomware encrypt files on the system's hard disk. Others may simply lock the system and display messages intended to persuade the user to pay.

Ransomware first became popular in Russia. Now the use of ransomware scams has grown internationally. In June 2013, McAfee said it had collected over 250,000 unique samples of ransomware in the first three months of 2013. This is more than double the number of the previous year. CryptoLocker, a ransomware worm that surfaced in late-2013, had collected an estimated $3 million USD before it was taken down by authorities.

In May 2017, a piece of ransomware called spread around the world. It lasted four days and affected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries. Only about $130,000 (USD) was ever paid in ransom, but the attack affected a lot of large companies and organizations. The United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS) was hit hard by WannaCry. Hospitals could not access their files, and so many surgeries were cancelled and patients had to be turned away. The NHS was especially at risk because it was using a version of the Windows operating system called Windows XP that Microsoft no longer supported. This meant that Microsoft had not been sending out security updates for this version of Windows, leaving it open to the WannaCry virus. Other systems were affected even though they were running newer versions of Windows, because their users had not yet installed the most recent security updates. Even though it was not designed to actually damage computers or their files, WannaCry led to a lot of wasted time and money, showing how vulnerable the world still is to ransomware attacks.

Sleep deprivation

Sleep deprivation is the condition of not having enough sleep. The condition affects the brain and its cognitive function. The condition can be either chronic or acute. Paradoxically, sleep deprivation can be used to treat certain disorders, such as clinical depression. Sleep deprivation has also been used as a form of torture. Multiple factors can cause or contribute to sleep deprivation including poor sleep hygiene, lifestyle choices, work obligations, sleep disorders, and other medical conditions. Sleep deficiency may be caused by other sleep disorders or medical conditions. For example, sleep apnea, a breathing disorder that induces dozens of nightly awakenings, may hinder both sleep duration and quality. Other medical or mental health problems, such as pain or general anxiety disorder, can interfere with the quality and quantity of sleep.
Generally, sleep deprivation may result in:

There are many reasons why a person may not get enough sleep. Examples include:


Sleep deprivation and sleep insufficiency may be categorised in different ways depending on a person’s circumstances.


False memory

Both perception ("experiencing") and remembering are processes which involve the brain. For this reason, errors do sometimes occur. Errors in perception are commonly called illusions. Emil Kraepelin used the term "Erinnerungsverfälschung" (memory falsification) to speak about false memories.

Perceptions need stimuli to be created. A perception without a stimulus is called hallucination. Much like the difference between illusion and hallucination, Kraepelin wanted to distinguish between a false memory and memories of something that did not really happen, which he called "Erinnerkungsfälschung". Unfortunately, both German terms translate to the same English term.

A false memory is a condition where a person remembers something that did not occur or where the memory does not closely match the occurrence. 

Using suggestion and hypnosis, it is possible to make people believe they experienced something, when they did not. Such phenomena also occur spontaneously, for example in a stressful situation, or when someone is not sleeping enough. 

To prove the existence of false memories, an experiment was conducted: People were given small stories of supposed relatives who told how these people were lost in a shopping mall, at age five or six, and how they had to be "rescued" by an adult. The experiment was done with 24 people. Afterwards, six people said that they remembered the event, even though it had never happened.

False memories can sometimes be shared by multiple people. This is sometimes called the Mandela effect. Examples include memories of the Berenstain Bears' name being spelled "Berenstein", and of the existence of a 1990s movie entitled "Shazaam" starring comedian Sinbad as a genie.

The effect is named after South African anti-Apartheid leader Nelson Mandela after people believed he died in prison in the 1980s (he actually died in 2013, after having served as President of South Africa from 1994-99), which she claimed was shared by "perhaps thousands" of other people.

Sometimes, people are accused of a crime, and often part of the evidence consists of facts other people remember. It is a problem to convict someone of a crime, based only on such evidence. In the case of sexual abuse or of child abuse these memories will usually be bad ones, and the brain will have changed them, as a measure of protection. Before a conviction is done, the court needs to make sure that the conviction does not happen based on the recollection of only one person, as recovering the "facts" behind the memories can be difficult.

Julieta Castellanos

Julieta Castellanos (born 8 January 1954) is a Honduran sociologist. She is the rector of the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH) since 2009. Castellanos has worked against violence in Honduras, working mostly on drug cartels and police corruption. She worked for reform of the courts and the police. In 2004, Castellanos started the Observatorio de la Violencia (Violence Observatory) at UNAH. The Violence Observatory analyzes crime statistics in Honduras. She was also a member of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The job of this commission was to find the facts of the 2009 coup that removed President Manuel Zelaya from power.

Castellanos was born in San Francisco de Becerra, Olancho on 8 January 1954. Her mother was Rafael Castellanos of Santa Bárbara, and her father was Ernestina Ruiz of Olancho. She grew up in the sugar fields of rural Honduras. In 1968, Castellanos' father gave her a test to be a student at the Normal School for Girls in the city of Tegucigalpa. She entered the school and graduated in 1973 with a teaching degree. In 1974, Castellanos won two scholarships to study social work at the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH) and social sciences in the College of Teachers. After several years of study, she finished her studies with a master's degree in economics from UNAH and a bachelor's degree in sociology from the University of Costa Rica. 

After she finished her studies, Castellanos became a professor at UNAH in 1978. She was head of the Social Sciences Department and President of the Association of Teachers from 1997 to 2001. Castellanos was also the President of the Association of Professors of the University Center of General Studies (CUEG) in 1986, Coordinator of the Violence Observatory since 2005, consultant to the Arias Foundation for Human Progress and the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), and Research Associate of the Centro de Documentatión de Honduras (CEDOH). For 13 years, Castellanos was also the author of a newspaper column.

Castellanos was elected to a four-year term as Rector of the National Autonomous University of Honduras in 2009. At the time of her appointment as rector, she was also the Coordinator of the UNAH Violence Observatory and Director of the Instituto Universitario en Democracia Paz y Seguridad (Institute for Democracy, Peace and Security, IUDPAS). IUDPAS was started with support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) when Castellanos worked as a consultant for the UNDP. Castellanos took the place of Jorge Abraham Arita, who was removed for incompetence. In a press conference, College Board president Olvin Rodriguez said Castellanos was chosen as rector because she was well-respected by the university community, and also by Honduran society and internationally.

Shortly after Castellanos got the job of rector, President Manuel Zelaya was removed from power in a coup. During a demonstration by University students, the police tired to stop the demonstration. The police pushed Castellanos down when she tried to stop them. During her time as rector, she had disagreements with SITRAUNAH, the union for the University's employees. She also received criticism because she fired 60 employees who protested at the university 2009. Castellanos oversaw the construction of a sports complex, an administrative building, and a university clinic. The university invested L1,500 million in the clinic.

Castellanos' four years as rector ended in April 2013. She remained interim rector. In September 2013, she won an election for another term as head of the university.

Castellanos was a strong advocate for police reform and against violent crime in Honduras. She pushed for an international commission to oversee a purge of the police. The National Congress of Honduras approved the idea. Castellanos also spoke about gun politics in Honduras. She asked the Honduran armed forces to destroy illegal guns, including AK-47s.

In October 2011, the Honduran national police kidnapped and killed Castellanos' 22-year-old son. The incident called attention to the degree of corruption within the Honduran police. Castellanos called for an end to foreign aid for the Honduran police and military, demanding that they "stop feeding the beast."

Castellanos received the first Martin Luther King, Jr. Award on 20 April 2012. The Martin Luther King, Jr. Foundation and the Instituto Hondureño de Cultura Interamericana gave her the award in a ceremony.

In March 2013, Castellanos received the International Women of Courage Award from the U.S. State Department. US Secretary of State John Kerry and First Lady Michelle Obama presented the award.

Australia took part for the first time ever and was invited to the Grand Final as a special guest. Ukraine did not participate due to financial problems related to Russia's invasion of Crimea.

According to the rules of Eurovision 2015, there would be 27 countries in the Grand Final. These included host country Austria, the Big 5 (France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom), Australia and the twenty countries which qualified from the semi-finals.

The first semi-final took place on Tuesday, the 19th May 2015. 16 countries participated in this semi-final. Those 16 countries plus Austria, France and Spain voted in this semi-final. The rankings from each country's jury vote and public vote were combined and the ten best ranked countries qualified for the final.
The second semi-final took place on Thursday, the 21th May 2015. 17 countries participated in this semi-final. Those countries plus Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom voted in this semi-final. The rankings from each country's jury vote and public vote were combined and the ten best ranked countries qualified for the final.
The Grand Final took place on Saturday, the 23th May 2015. The 27 finalists were Austria, the Big Five, the twenty qualifiers from the semi-finals and Australia, who was invited as a special guest. The winner was Sweden, with the song "Heroes" by Måns Zelmerlöw.

Satellite DNA

Satellite DNA has many sections of repeating, non-coding DNA. 

Satellite DNA is a type of tandem repeat. The repeats sit next to each other, in tandem. These are multiple copies of the same base-pair sequence lying end-to-end. Tandem repeats also include minisatellite and microsatellite DNA. 
Satellite DNA is the main component of centromeres. It forms the main part of heterochromatin.

The most common type of tandem repeat is the heterochromatin, which sits on chromosomes around the centromeres and elsewhere. It is "transcriptionally inactive", meaning, it does not code for proteins.

Tandem repeat

Tandem repeats occur in DNA when a pattern of nucleotides is repeated. The repeats sit next to each other, in tandem. These are multiple copies of the same base-pair sequence lying end-to-end. 

An example would be: ATTCG ATTCG ATTCG in which the sequence ATTCG is repeated three times.

If between 10 and 60 nucleotides are repeated, it is called a minisatellite. Those with fewer are known as microsatellites or 'short tandem repeats'.

When exactly two nucleotides are repeated, it is called a "dinucleotide repeat" (for example: ACACACAC…).

When three nucleotides are repeated, it is called a "trinucleotide repeat" (for example: CAGCAGCAGCAG…). Abnormalities in such regions can give rise to trinucleotide repeat disorders.

The repeat unit copy number may be variable. This is a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR). 

A tandem repeat pattern helps determine an individual's inherited traits. Tandem repeats can be very useful in determining parentage. Short tandem repeats are used for certain genealogical DNA tests.

In genetic fingerprinting and DNA profiling, DNA is examined from tandem repeats in the chromosomal DNA. 

Dusty the Klepto Kitty

Dusty the Klepto Kitty is a famous Snowshoe cat. He became popular in early 2011 for his acts of "burglary" in his neighborhood.

By then, Dusty had stolen 16 car wash mitts, 7 sponges, 213 dish towels, 7 wash cloths, 5 bath towels, 18 shoes, 73 socks, 100 gloves, 1 pair of mittens, 3 aprons, 40 balls, 4 pairs of underwear, 1 dog collar, 6 rubber toys, 1 blanket, 3 leg warmers, 2 Frisbees, 1 golf club cover, 1 safety mask, 2 mesh bags, 1 bag of water balloons, 1 pair of pajama pants, 8 swimsuits, and 8 other objects. 

His behavior got him an appearance on the "Late Show with David Letterman" in February 2011. 

He got the nickname "Klepto Kitty"" because of the word Kleptomania. He had already taken more than 600 items from the gardens he roams around in. Most of his theft happens at night. The most he has brought home at once is eleven things, his owners say. He has even been caught on camera carrying home a bra.

Dusty was born on March 20, 2006. He lives in San Mateo, California. He was adopted from an animal shelter; the Peninsula Humane Society. His owners are Jean Chu and Jim Coleman.

For his first two years, Dusty stayed home and seemed to be a normal cat. But in 2008, his owners began to find items and clothes that did not belong to them showing up in the house. Sometimes, the cat would put them in his owner's bed. They began to suspect that their cat was bringing them home. This turned out to be very true.

Dusty didn't really get much attention outside of his neighborhood until February 2011. Animal Planet had read about him in People magazine. Animal Planet had a TV show named "Must Love Cats" and they made a feature about Dusty. Their crew was able to set up a night vision camera and catch Dusty bringing home his treasures. After this, there was a news story on KGO TV station in San Francisco . He began to be seen in YouTube videos and got famous on the internet. He was interviewed with his owners on the "Late Show with David Letterman" on February 22, 2011.

After he was seen on Letterman's show and other news shows around the world, Dusty became a celebrity. He has been shown at many community events in the San Francisco Bay Area. He was the Grand Marshal of the Redwood City Pet Parade in May 2011. 

Because Dusty was adopted from the Peninsula Humane Society animal shelter, he made a celebrity appearance at their annual adopt-a-thon in June, 2011. Some of his unclaimed stolen items were shown. They were given away to people who gave a donation.

Some of the kitty-cam movie for the Animal Planet documentary was used as a bonus feature on the DVD release for the 2011 movie "Puss in Boots". It is named "Klepto Kitty". It is about three minutes and a half minutes long.

He has a Facebook page for his fans. It shows pictures of the latest things that Dusty brings home.

Optic tectum

The optic tectum is a major part of the midbrain of vertebrates. In vertebrates such as fish, reptiles and birds, it is the main visual processor of the brain. 

In mammals, however, most of the work is done in the visual cortex. This is at the back of the cerebral cortex. The tectum does preliminary visual processing, and controls eye movement. When human anatomy textbooks use the term superior colliculus they are referring to the tectum. The diagram is based on human anatomy.

Each layer of the tectum contains a topographic map of the surrounding world. If neurons at a point in the map fire, it starts a response towards the corresponding point in space. In primates, the tectum ("superior colliculus") directs eye movements. Visual input from the retina, or "command" input from the cerebral cortex, create a "bump" of activity in the tectal map. If strong enough, this causes an eye movement. 

In primates, the tectum is also involved in generating head turns, arm-reaching movements, and shifts in attention which do not involve any movements. In other species, the tectum is involved in a wide range of responses, including whole-body turns in walking rats, swimming fishes, or flying birds; tongue-strikes toward prey in frogs; fang-strikes in snakes, etc.

In some non-mammal species, including fish and birds, the tectum is one of the largest components of the brain. In mammals, and especially primates, the massive expansion of the cerebral cortex reduces the tectum ("superior colliculus") to a much smaller fraction of the whole brain. It still is the main integrating centre for eye movements.

Trogons are residents of tropical forests worldwide. The greatest diversity is in the Neotropics, where four genera, with 24 species occur. The genus "Apaloderma" has the three African species. The genera "Harpactes" and "Apalharpactes", with twelve species, live in southeast Asia.

They feed on insects and fruit. Their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they do not fly long distances. Trogons are generally not migratory. They have soft, often colourful, feathers with distinctive male and female plumage. They are the only type of animal with a heterodactyl toe arrangement. They nest in holes dug into trees or termite nests, laying 2–4 white or pastel-coloured eggs.

Special agents work for many different law enforcement agencies. In some agencies, only special agents may carry firearms. An example is special agents in the Internal Revenue Service. To become special agents most applicants must pass written and physical examinations. In the FBI, like many agencies, applicants must go through a background check.

Congress was the first to use the title in 1801 when they changed the name of U.S.Post office "surveyors" to "special agents". In 1880, the U.S. Congress created the position of "Chief Postal Inspector" and renamed these special agents to postal inspectors.

Naval Criminal Investigative Service

The United States Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) is the primary law enforcement agency of the United States Department of the Navy (DON). It investigates activities concerning crimes against or by United States Navy and U.S. Marine Corps personnel. It also is tasked with national security, counter-intelligence, and counter-terrorism cases. NCIS is the successor organization to the former Naval Investigative Service (NIS).

About half of the 2,500 NCIS employees are civilian special agents. They are trained to carry out a wide variety of assignments at locations around the world. NCIS special agents are armed federal law enforcement investigators. They frequently coordinate with other U.S. government agencies. NCIS special agents are supported by other employees. These include analysts and experts in forensics, surveillance, surveillance countermeasures, computer investigations, physical security, and polygraph examinations. At times NCIS will use outside agencies. For example, they have used the Smithsonian Institution to help identify skeletal remains.

NCIS traces its roots to Navy Department General Order 292 of 1882, signed by William H. Hunt, Secretary of the Navy. This established the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). At first the ONI was tasked with collecting information on the characteristics and weaponry of foreign vessels, charting foreign passages, rivers, or other bodies of water, and touring overseas fortifications, industrial plants, and shipyards.

When the US entered World War I, the ONI's responsibilities expanded to include espionage, sabotage, and intelligence gathering on the Navy's potential enemies. In World War II the ONI became responsible for the investigation of sabotage, espionage and subversive activities that posed any kind of threat to the Navy.

In 1966, NIS was established as a part of ONI. The new service answered to the director of Naval Intelligence. In the early 1970s a special agent was assigned to the "USS Intrepid" for six months. This was the beginning of the Special Agent Afloat program. Special agents are assigned to an aircraft carrier for a one-year deployment. They were later assigned to Amphibious warfare groups. In 1977 US Marine criminal investigators began training with NCIS.

In 1992, now called the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), the agency came under direct control of the Secretary of the Navy. Now an independent agency their director was a civilian. In 1995 a cold case homicide unit was set up.

NCIS is the investigative and counterintelligence arm of the Department of the Navy. NCIS works with local, state, federal and foreign law enforcement agencies. They investigate and counter crimes including terrorism, homicide, espionage, arson, child abuse and rape. Within the Navy they investigate felonies and crimes punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. NCIS provides protective services for key Navy leaders. They also provide services to protect all members of the US Navy wherever they are serving.

She became the oldest living person in the United States upon the death of Dina Manfredini on December 17, 2012, and became the oldest living person in the world on April 1, 2015 following the death of Japanese woman Misao Okawa.

At the time of her death in April 2015, she was considered as the 7th-oldest validated person ever, and the 3rd-oldest person ever from the United States, after Sarah Knauss and Lucy Hannah. After Hannah's age was debunked in 2020, it turned out that she was in fact the 6th-oldest validated person ever as well as the 2nd-oldest person ever from the United States at the time of her death. By 2016, she is the 3rd-oldest since her age was surpassed by Susannah Mushatt Jones. In April 2023, Delphia Welford (1875 - 1992) has been validated, so Weaver was in fact the 3rd-oldest person ever from the United States at the time of her death and currently the 4th-oldest.

Range

Range might mean:


Dentin

Dentin or dentine is calcified tissue that makes up the second layer of teeth. In the crown (top) of a tooth, dentin is found between enamel and pulp. In the root of a tooth, it is found between cementum and pulp. Dentin makes up most of a tooth. Dentin is yellow. The yellowness of dentin shows through in a tooth because enamel is semi-translucent.

Dentin is made up of

The process of creating dentin is called dentinogenesis. It is made by odontoblasts, a special type of cell that activates later during formation of teeth. Unlike enamel, a tooth can keep making more dentin throughout life.

Dentin is divided into different types based on when it is made.

Primary dentin makes up most of the tooth. It is the thick bulk between enamel and pulp. Primary dentin is the type of dentin a tooth starts out with. It can also be called circumpulpal (surrounding the pulp) dentin. Mantle dentin is a separate, harder but thinner layer that separates primary dentin from the tooth crown.

Secondary dentin is made after a tooth has already appeared in the mouth. This type of dentin is made throughout life. Newly made dentin is found placed very close to the pulp. It is found between pulp and primary dentin.

Unlike secondary dentin, tertiary (third in order) dentin is not made continuously throughout life. Tertiary dentine is only made when the tooth is damaged.


Peat swamp forest

Peat swamp forests are forest wetlands in tropical and subtropical areas. They have poor drainage. Waterlogged soil prevents dead leaves and wood from decomposing fully. Over time, this creates a thick layer of acidic peat. They are made up of trees which are broadleaved (not conifers), and many other types of flowering plants. 

Peat swamp forests are usually surrounded by lowland rain forests on better-drained soils. There may be brackish or salt-water mangrove forests near the coast. 

These tropical swamp forests are quite different from the north temperate peat bogs in climates such as in Ireland. Temperate peat bogs are not caused by forests, but mostly by mosses such as "Sphagnum", grasses, sedges and shrubs.

About 62% of the world’s tropical peat lands are in southeast Asia. In this area 80% is in Indonesia, 11% in Malaysia, 6% in Papua New Guinea, with pockets in Brunei, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Thailand. They have trees up to 70 m high. The spongy, unstable, waterlogged, anaerobic beds of peat can be up to 20 m deep with low pH (pH 2.9 – 4) and low nutrients. The forest floor is seasonally flooded. The water is stained dark brown by the tannins that leach from the fallen leaves and peat – hence the name ‘blackwater swamps’. During the dry season, the peat remains waterlogged and pools lie among the trees.

Tropical peatlands coexist with swamp forests in these tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests. In this biome vast amounts of carbon as soil organic matter store up – much more than natural forests contain. They are among the largest near-surface reserves of terrestrial organic carbon. Unfortunately, regardless of their importance, peat swamp forests are one of the most threatened, yet least studied and most poorly understood biotypes.

Large areas of these forests are being logged at high rates.
Since the 1970s, peat swamp forest deforestation and drainage have increased greatly. In addition, El Niño and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drought and large-scale fires are accelerating peatland devastation. This destruction increass the carbon release to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Tropical peatlands have already become a large CO source, but data is limited.

Tropical peat swamp forests are home to thousands of animals and plants, including many rare and critically endangered species such as the orangutan and Sumatran tiger, whose habitats are threatened by peatland deforestation.

H. H. Holmes

Dr. Herman Webster Mudgett (May 16, 1861 – May 7, 1896), better known under the name of Dr. Henry Howard Holmes, was one of the first documented serial killers in the modern sense of the term. He was born in Gilmanton, New Hampshire. A graduate of the University of Michigan medical School Class of 1884; until his .execution in 1896 he would choose a career of crime including Insurance fraud, swindling; check forging; 3 to 4 bigamous illegal marriages; murder and horse theft.

In Chicago at the time of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, Holmes opened a hotel which he had designed and built for himself specifically with murder in mind, and which was the location of many of his murders. While he confessed to 27 murders, of which nine were confirmed, his actual body count could be as high as from 133 to perhaps 200. It will not be known how many murders Holmes committed as he did not always tell the entire truth of his crimes- for example: he claimed one of his first murder victims was a medical school classmate Dr Robert Leacock in 1886 for insurance money; in fact Dr Leacock died in Watford, Ontario Canada October 5, 1889. Contrary to several accounts Holmes did not kill Dr. E. S. Holton. Likewise Holmes did not kill an alleged "Castle" victim Miss Kate Durkee-who turned out to be very much alive. Ironically one historian noted that one of Holmes creditor's named John DeBrueil died of apoplexy on April 17, 1891, in Holmes "Castle" drugstore-it is unknown if Holmes was involved with his demise. Holmes also had a one-story factory which he claimed was to be used for glass bending. It is unknown if the factory furnace was ever actually used for glass bending-or to cremate incriminating evidence of Holmes crimes. Holmes usual murder method was by suffocation of his victims including: an overdose of chloroform; overexposure to lighting gas fumes; trapped in an airless vault to give some examples. Holmes also claimed to have used starvation and burning victiums alive in his "castle"

Contemporary newspaper accounts reported several known or suspected victims of Holmes:

Holmes "hotel" was partially burned by fire in August 1895; it was later used for storage until it was torn down in 1938. The site of the "hotel" is adjoining the Englewood Post Office building at 63rd and Wallace Streets, Chicago, Illinois.

On May 7, 1896, Holmes was hanged at Moyamensing Prison, also known as the Philadelphia County Prison, for four murders and six attempted murders. The murder for which Holmes would be executed for was that of his accomplice Benjamin Petzel in Philadelphia Pennsylvania [Sep 20, 1894]; evidence was also uncovered in the search for Holmes of his involvement in the subsequent murders of three of Petzel's children: Howard Petzel in Irvington, Indiana [October 10, 1894] and Alice and Nellie Petzel in Toronto, Canada [October 25, 1894] . Ironically although Holmes "Murder Castle" was undoubtedly the scene of many of his murders, it was the murder of Petzel in Philadelphia which had the clearest case for murder-as there was only very circumstansial physical evidence of the "Castle" victiums- a piece of human bone possibly from Julia Conner; remains of a child-possibly Pearl Conner; a burned gold watch chain and burned dress buttons-apparently belonging to Minnie Williams; a tuft of human female hair found in a chimney flue.

Patrick Quinlan who admitted as a workman to building fireproof rooms, trapdoors and walls in Holmes "castle" and who was also the building janitor and caretaker, died March 4, 1914 in Portland Michigan - an apparent suicide. A note left behind said simply "I could not sleep".

Some theorize that Jack the Ripper and H.H. Holmes are the same person, Except the facts that both of the motives were different, While Jack the Ripper typically went after poor women who were sex workers, H.H. Holmes was typically after money. A lot of experts deny that both of the men were the same person

Cementum is the hard outside layer of a tooth root. It is not present in the crown (part above the gums) portion of a tooth. Cementum allows periodontal ligaments to attach onto it, allowing tooth to be connected to the maxilla or mandible.

Cementum is made up of

The process of creating cementum is called cementogenesis. It is made by special type of cells known as cementoblasts. Cementoblasts are found on the surface of the cementum. When a cementoblast is no longer on the surface, or when it is found surrounded by cementum, it is then known as a cementocyte.

In contrast, cementoclasts are special cells that remove cementum instead of making cementum.

The cementoenamel junction, or the cervical line, is the where enamel and cementum meet. The cementum and enamel may meet in different ways.

Cementum can be divided into two main types based on its location and whether it has cells or not.

In the UK it reached the Top 50 pop albums list and went to No. 1 for several months on the country charts. It has gone to sell 17 million copies world wide.

The track "Shameless" is a cover of a Billy Joel song, previously recorded on his 1989 album "Storm Front".

According to music review website Allmusic, "Ropin' the Wind" is the first country album to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.

Brooks commented on the album saying :
""Ropin' the Wind was what we called the son of Fences. Ropin' the Wind was made in this kind of tour that we were on from No Fences. We were gone, pretty much 250 days out of the year. And in that remaining 100 days, I elected to cut Ropin' The Wind, and try to write for it. This album became a lot bigger than I ever thought it could possibly be. And when I listen to the singles off of it like Rodeo, What She's Doing Now, The River, Papa Loved Mama, and Shameless, I look at it and stand very proud. And then when I also look at the cuts, Against The Grain, Cold Shoulder, these songs I am equally proud of."'"


This track was not on the original release of the album. It first appeared when the album was re-released as part of Brooks' first "Limited Series" box set collection, and remained part of subsequent releases of the album until 2014, when it was released digitally for the first time.

In Pieces

In Pieces is the fifth studio album by American country music artist Garth Brooks. It was released on August 31, 1993. It debuted at #1 on the "Billboard" 200 and the Top Country Albums chart. It was also a huge hit outside the United States. In Great Britain it was Brooks' highest placed album on the charts. It reached the top ten of the country album charts before it was issued officially (due to imports from both the United States and Ireland). Critics felt that this would ruin the album's sales once it was issued. However, when it was eventually issued in Britain in early 1994 it went to #1 on the country charts and reached #2 in the pop charts and also produced two top 40 hit singles on the British pop charts.

The track "Callin' Baton Rouge" was previously a #37 peaking single in 1987 for the New Grass Revival, whose members back Brooks on his rendition. It was the first time the group had recorded together since they disbanded in 1989.

In an interview with BBC Radio DJ Richard Wooton, Brooks stated that the track "The Cowboy Song" (which was composed in 1987 by Roy Robinson) was found in a trash can by someone on his team who liked the song and played the track to him.

Brooks commented on the album saying:
""In Pieces was just time to smile. It was time to laugh, it was time to get loud. It's definitely the most live album that we've ever cut. I think the band went to a different level on this. They seemed to play more like a band that had been together for years than studio musicians that come together and play at time to time. So this one is all there for me. I like to listen to it loud, and I just love the stuff like Baton Rouge and Ain't Going Down Til The Sun Comes Up. From One Night A Day, all the way to the very last song, The Cowboy Song, which is definitely my favorite off In Pieces and it will stand up with anything that I have cut over the past five years. Like the other things, I'm very proud of this one and I hope you like it.""

The track ordering has varied on different releases of this album.




"In Pieces" debuted at #1 on the U.S. "Billboard" 200, becoming his third, and #1 on the Top Country Albums, becoming his fourth #1 Country album. In July 1998, "In Pieces" was certified 8 x Platinum by the RIAA.

Brooks commented on the album saying:

""Everyone was expecting this album to be pop. Everyone said we were leaving (country). For the first time ever, I was involved (in writing) in eight of the 10 cuts, so it's a huge reflection of myself. It's the things I enjoy singing about. I got to sing about the band on the road, I got to sing about cowboys, and more importantly, the women who put up with those cowboys."'

Brooks commented on the album by saying:

""I'm proud, I'm excited, I'm nervous, and it feels good to be back in the game again. This is a very personal album. I only wrote six of the songs, but there are many that are so 'me' that people I work with every day thought I wrote them"".

Fresh Horses

Fresh Horses is a 1988 coming of age drama film directed by David Anspaugh, and starring Andrew McCarthy and Molly Ringwald.

Cincinnati college senior Matt Larkin (Andrew McCarthy) seems to have a picture perfect life: he is well-liked at his mid-western college, that he is soon to graduate, has a beautiful, waspy fiancée, friends, parties and good times. But when Matt meets Jewel (Molly Ringwald), his carefully constructed house of cards falls apart and changes him forever.

Matt’s content with his very proper fiancée and his safe life, so when his best friend Tipton (Ben Stiller) relates a story of a night spent in a rough country house filled with seedy characters, beer, music and women, Matt initially scoffs at the idea of visiting. However, as he ponders his imminent marriage, he decides to check it out - no harm done, just a little fun before life gets serious.

The two drive out to the house, in the "boonies", expecting a wild party, however, when they arrive, they find only the aftermath of a debaucherous night—cigarette butts and bottles strewn everywhere, a bluesy ZZ Top tune on the stereo, a solitary biker playing pool and a woman’s muffled giggle coming from upstairs. Disappointed, Matt goes to fetch a beer for Tipton and in doing so, in the kitchen, meets Jewel.

Jewel is all mystery and trailer park at the same time. She’s a poor Kentucky girl, obviously grown up uneducated, yet Matt is instantly drawn to her. He returns to seek her out and the attraction they share is obvious. Despite their social differences, Matt is completely infatuated.

His life soon does a 180. He breaks off his engagement, sneaks out at night and stops seeing his friends. However Matt is yet to figure out who exactly Jewel is and discover the secrets she is hiding (including an abusive husband and stepfather, the shady people that hang around the house, as well as the fact she is underage).

As a result the two worlds collide and it seems they are doomed by circumstance. After Matt has a run in with Jewel’s spouse, the ultra-seedy Green (Viggo Mortenson), Matt and Jewel must make the decision they have both been dreading, but will ultimately free them.


Filming locations in Kentucky included Kenton, Boone and Gallatin Counties, and the city of Warsaw; In Ohio, the University of Cincinnati, the city of Cincinnati, and Kings Island amusement park, then in Deerfield Township, Warren County, Ohio, now in Mason; and Switzerland County, Indiana.

Critical reaction to the film was mixed. In his review for the "Los Angeles Times", Michael Wilmington said, "[t]here's a lot to admire in the film adaptation of Larry Ketron's play 'Fresh Horses'" and called the dialogue "fresh, sad and funny." He also praised the work of director Anspaugh and cinematographer Fred Murphy, saying they give the movie "a very distinctive look: moody and poetic, grainy and wistful, drenched with a sad, faraway, forget-me-not drizzle of passion and regrets." However, he concluded that the "movie refuses to jell."

The film performed poorly, earning $3,074,292 in the opening weekend, and a total of $6,640,346 domestically - only 46.3% of the total gross, failing to recoup its $14 million budget. 

The film is based upon the play of the same name, also by Larry Ketron. It was first performed at the WPA Theatre, New York City on February 4, 1986 with a cast including Suzy Amis.

When she died her estate was worth $600,000 (worth about $8 million today). So this may not have been entirely true. She made her fortune in the hair care business.

Two of her brothers were barbers there. She worked washing clothes for $1.50 USD a day. She also attended night school. In 1894 Breedlove married for the second time to John Davis. But the marriage failed as he was unfaithful to her.

In the 1890s Breedlove began losing her hair due to a scalp condition. She began experimenting with home made cures. At the 1904 World's Fair Breedlove met Annie (Turnbow) Malone. By 1905 she was selling Malone's products. Breedlove moved to Denver where she married her second husband, Charles Joseph Walker. In a dream it came to her what to mix up for a hair product. One of the ingredients was only available in Africa so she sent for some. Her hair started growing again. She started her own business selling a product she developed "Madam Walker's Wonderful Hair Grower" It was designed as a scalp healer and hair conditioner. As Mrs C.J. Walker she changed her business name to "Madam" C.J. Walker. in 1906, her daughter A'Lelia graduated from college and came to work managing her mother's company. This freed Walker to begin selling her product door-to-door. She gave presentations to church groups wherever she could. In 1908 she started her own college in Pittsburgh to train her salespeople.

In 1910 she incorporated her company. She could not attract big investors so she used $10,000 of her own money to start her school and factory in Indianapolis. She was the sole shareholder of the Madame C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company. Sarah Walker was a serious business women. She began mixing herbs and shampoos. Her products where especially for black women. In a short time she had trained 40,000 salespeople, her "Walker Agents". Her agents learned her system of vegetable shampoos, witch hazel, cold creams and diets. She didn't invent the hot comb, for straightening hair. But she improved it with wider teeth just for black women's hair. 

Walker attended the National Negro Business League Thirteenth Annual Convention in 1912. No women were included on the schedule of speakers. Walker got up and took the podium from Booker T. Washington who was moderating. She told her story and why women should be included. At the fourteenth convention she was on the schedule of speakers. She had the ability to inspire others.

Walker was a leader and a role model in the black community. She was one of the first female African Americans to create hair care products for black women. This was at a time when almost all products where for white people. The goal of her starting her business was to make female African Americans feel better about themselves. They could feel better about their appearance by using her products. Walker re-invented hair straightening just for black people. Her way of making money helped her and also got her employees out of poverty. Whenever they would make a sale for her they would get a certain percentage of the money. She did get some criticism from other black leaders. Booker T. Washington criticized her for making black women look like white women. He did not like skin bleaching and straightened hair. But she stated that the crucial ingredients for her hair care products came from Africa. Madam C. J. Walker died on May 25, 1919.

Dred Scott v. Sandford

Dred Scott v. Sandford, , was a US Supreme Court landmark decision. In March 1857, the court ruled that blacks, whether slaves, or free, were not citizens of the United States. They could not, therefore, sue in federal court.

Dred Scott had sued in federal court and claimed that he was free because he had lived in free territory. He lost his case in a ruling that has been condemned by many as the Supreme Court's worst decision.

The Dred Scott case, which denied Scott his freedom by ruling that blacks were not US citizens, was the end of years of legal cases from 1846 to 1857 in lower federal district court and Missouri courts, which had granted Dred Scott freedom for about two years.

Dr. John Emerson was a surgeon serving in the US Army. In 1833, he purchased Dred Scott, a slave in Missouri. The same year, he moved to Illinois and took Scott with him. Emerson was sent to a fort in the Wisconsin Territory. Scott, his slave, went with him.

While living in Wisconsin Territory (now Minnesota), Scott met and married Harriet Robinson. She was owned by a justice of the peace. After marrying Scott, Emerson became her owner as well. Emerson returned to Missouri and took his slaves with him.

In 1843, Emerson died in Missouri. Scott and his family were left to Emerson's wife, Eliza Sandford.

In 1846, Scott sued for his freedom in court. Helped by abolitionist lawyers, he claimed that he was free because he had lived in free states for a long time. The defense claimed that Dr. Emerson was forced to move to the Wisconsin Territory because he served with the US Army and that he should be able to keep his property. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, decided that Scott was not free and so he did not have a right to sue. Furthermore, he stated that the US Congress could not make laws against slavery in United States territories. The majority opinion was agreed to by seven of the nine Justices.

The dissenting Justices pointed out when the US Constitution was ratified, blacks were already considered citizens in several states.

The ruling was a major setback to the anti-slavery movement. The Republican Party condemned the ruling. In effect, it allowed slavery in all US territories, even in the North.

The decision became a central issue in slavery debates and helped cause Abraham Lincoln to be elected as US President and then the American Civil War.

In 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment banned slavery in the United States. In 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment overturned the Dred Scott decision and gave nearly all persons born in the country US citizenship regardless of their color.

Soon after the 1857 decision, Eliza Sandford sold Scott and his family to Taylor Blow. Blow, ne of Scott's previous owners, then granted Scott and his family their freedom. Scott died a free man on September 17, 1858. He did not live long enough to see blacks become US citizens.

"Dred Scott" is one of only four decisions by the Supreme Court that were overturned by an amendment to the United States Constitution. The other three are:

Arguably, one more case could be added:

Georg Simon Ohm

Georg Simon Ohm (16 March 1789 - 6 July 1854) was a German physicist and mathematician. During part of the time in his life, Ohm worked as a school teacher. Some of his research focused on the new electrochemical cell, invented by Italian scientist Alessandro Volta. Using equipment he had created himself, Ohm found that there is a direct proportionality between the potential difference (voltage) applied across a conductor and the resultant electric current. This relationship is known as Ohm's law.

In 1881, after his death, the SI unit for electrical resistance was named "Ohm" in his honour. The uppercase Greek letter Omega (Ω) is used for the unit.

Radiography

Radiography is the name for the use of X-rays to see what is happening to parts of the body. It is an imaging technique which uses electromagnetic radiation other than light, usually X-rays. 

To create the image, a beam of X-rays is produced by an X-ray machine and is projected toward the object. A certain amount of X-ray is absorbed by the object, which is dependent on the density and composition of that object. The X-rays that pass through the object are captured behind the object by a detector (either photographic film or a digital detector). The detector gives a superimposed 2D representation of the object's internal structures. 

Tomography is a more advanced way of using X-rays. In tomography, the machine blurs out structures not in the focal plane. This gives a series of pictures, like a set of slices through the body. It is called CT scanning, or computer tomography. The computer builds a 3-D picture for the expert to look at.

Radiography has many medical and industrial uses.

The Place Beyond the Pines

Kevin Jagernauth of Indiewire gave a positive review and said that it was a "ambitious epic that is cut from some of the same thematic tissue as Cianfrance's previous film, but expands the scope into a wondrously widescreen tale of fathers, sons and the legacy of sins that are passed down through the generations".


Subsidiary alliance

Subsidiary alliance is a system developed by the East India Company by Lord Wellesley. It solved the problem of ruling a nation which is under the rule of a king. 

Some of the rules of the subsidiary alliance were:
Under this doctrine, Indian rulers under British protection surrendered the control of their foreign affairs to the British. Most disbanded their native armies, instead maintaining British troops within their states to protect them from attack. As British power grew, in most parts of India this became increasingly unlikely. The system also allowed the British to maintain their army at the expense of local rulers.

Prosimian

Prosimians are a group of proto-primates. It includes:
1. All living and extinct strepsirrhines (lemurs, lorises, and adapiforms), and 
2. haplorhine tarsiers and their extinct relatives, the omomyiforms. 

All of them have characteristics that are more "primitive" than simians (monkeys, apes, and humans). On the other hand, they have survived. Therefore we know that their life-style is not directly competitive to that of the higher primates.

First, they are primarily carnivorous. They mainly eat insects, not fruit. They lack full colour vision: they are red-green blind (cannot see the difference between red and green). This has a corresponding advantage in that they can see better in the dark. This is also true of many placental mammals, and for the same reason. Mammals spent long periods as nocturnal animals during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.

Prosimians are not a clade (a group of an ancestor and all its descendants), but a convenient term. It is useful to compare their behaviour with that of later primates. Prosimians are not large-brained compared to other placental mammals. They are fairly intelligent animals. However, their brains are much smaller than those of simians of similar size.

Prosimians are the only primates native to Madagascar, and are also found throughout Africa and in Asia.

Notes

Adapiformes

Adapiformes are an extinct group of early primates. Adapiformes radiated throughout much of the northern continental mass, reaching as far south as northern Africa and tropical Asia. They lived from the Eocene to the Miocene epochs. Some adapiformes looked similar to living lemurs.

Adapiformes are known from the fossil record only, and it is unclear whether they form a monophyletic or paraphyletic group. When assumed to be a clade, they are usually grouped under the "wet-nosed" taxon Strepsirrhini, which would make them more closely related to the lemurs and less so to the "dry-nosed" Haplorhini taxon that includes monkeys and apes.

In 2009, Franzen and colleagues put the newly described genus "Darwinius" as a stem "missing link" between Strepsirrhini and Haplorhini. Later work on the "Darwinius" fossil by Erik Seiffert and colleagues rejected this "missing link" idea. They classify "Darwinius" and other adapiformes as Strepsirrhini.

The fossil record of the Adapiformes is quite considerable. The fossils are first found in the earliest Eocene, 55 million years ago (mya). They lived in four continents (North America, Africa, Europe and Asia). The Eocene was when the Earth was much warmer than today, with extensive tropical forests, far more so than today. The widespread remains have a much earlier origin, and molecular clock dates suggest that primates evolved more than 80–90 mya, nearly 40 million years before appearing in the fossil record.

Field-programmable gate array

A field-programmable gate array (often shortened to FPGA) is an electronic component used to build reconfigurable digital circuits. That means that an FPGA is different from a logic gate, because a logic gate has a fixed function. In contrast an FPGA has an undefined function at the time of manufacture. Before the FPGA can be used in a circuit it must be programmed, that is, reconfigured.

FPGAs are integrated circuits in the category of programmable logic devices or PLDs. FPGAs are the highest performance, most flexible and also the most expensive of the PLD types. A drawback of FPGAs compared to other PLDs is that they do not remember their design when the power is removed. An FPGA therefore needs a separate configuration memory chip that holds the FPGA design. When the power is given back to the FPGA a fixed part of the FPGA reads the configuration from the configuration memory chip. After the FPGA is configured it will be able to do the function it was given by the design.

An FPGA is different from a microprocessor or microcontroller. An FPGA in its basic form is not able to run software. Only when the FPGA is given a configuration that contains a processor-architecture it has the ability to run software.

FPGA manufacturers provide engineering software for Windows and sometimes also Linux, to develop designs for FPGAs. The design is commonly written in human readable computer files called a "hardware description language" (HDL). The most popular hardware description languages are VHDL and Verilog. Hardware description languages are strongly comparable to programming languages. But the intention of HDLs is to design digital logic circuits while programming languages design software.

The FPGA engineering software has to translate the abstract HDL code into the logic elements available in the selected FPGA. That is called logic synthesis. Then a process of place and route is done to position the logic elements in the FPGA. The result is a bitfile that can be programmed into the FPGA or the configuration memory. This is usually done with a USB programmer connected to the JTAG port of the FPGA.

Because the FPGA is an integrated circuit, an FPGA manufacturer can decide to add other commonly used integrated circuit components. These fixed parts are called cores. These are for example Ethernet controllers or even a complete processor-architecture. For different market segments such as defense, medical, communications and robotics the FPGA manufacturer tries to add the most valuable set of these additional cores.

FPGAs are generally built upon programmable logic elements and programmable interconnects. One building block of logic elements is a programmable lookup table (). A LUT can be programmed to output any value given input values. In this way, a LUT can be programmed to be any type of logic with the same number of inputs and outputs. For example, a 2-input, 1-output LUT can be programmed to emulate the logic of a 2-input AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, etc. The output of this LUT can be either saved using a or connected to the input of other LUTs. Using a programmable mux, the FPGA can be programmed to choose the registered or non-registered output. This combination of a LUT, a register, and a mux is the general structure of a logic element.

To connect these logic elements together, pass transistors are used. The transistor can be programmed to either connect a signal or not, thereby giving the FPGA the ability to very specifically connect logic elements together. For example, if the output of one logic elements will feed the input of another, the pass transistor can be programmed to connect these two wires together and match the specified logic. Between the logic elements and the pass transistors, a compiler can take a hardware description from an HDL, create the logic for the logic elements, and connect them together using the pass transistors.

Logic block

A logic block, sometimes called configurable logic block is a component of an FPGA. Each logic block can be configured to hold a number of logic gates, which are interconnected.

Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution

The Fourteenth Amendment (Amendment XIV) to the United States Constitution was adopted on July 9, 1868. It was one of the Reconstruction Amendments. The amendment discusses citizenship rights and equal protection of the laws. It was proposed in response to issues related to former slaves following the American Civil War. This amendment was bitterly contested. Southern states were forced to ratify it in order to regain representation in Congress. The Fourteenth Amendment is one of the most litigated parts of the Constitution. It forms the basis for landmark decisions such as "Roe v. Wade" (1973), and "Bush v. Gore" (2000). It remains the most important Constitutional amendment since the Bill of Rights was passed in 1791.

At the end of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves. The problem was, he did not ask Congress. Congress had not passed a law to free slaves. Meanwhile, some states still had slavery. The Thirteenth Amendment freed the slaves. It became law in late 1865. Three years later the Fourteenth Amendment provided civil rights. Republicans controlled Congress during this period. They wanted to give full citizenship to freed slaves. But they also realized that giving civil rights to black people, it opened the door for women's suffrage. It would lead to giving women the right to vote, which Congress did not want to do. If only section one was included in the amendment, the wording "all persons born or naturalized in the United States" would include women. For this reason, the word "male" was inserted in section two so the amendment would be approved by Congress.

The first section of the Fourteenth Amendment gave citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States”, and "subject to the jurisdiction thereof". The second clause, commonly called the "Privileges and Immunities Clause", states that "the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states." This gave all Americans the protection of civil rights under the law. It forbids states from denying citizens their life, their liberty or their property without due process. States could not deny persons "equal protection of the laws." It meant that for the first time all people would have the same protection no matter what their color. The fact that states were mentioned makes them responsible for these protections the same as the federal government. The Fourteenth Amendment is cited more often in law suits than any other amendment.

The second section changed a part of the original Constitution which counted slaves as three-fifths of a person. This was for the purpose of determining how many U.S. congressmen a state could have (apportionment). The second section established that every citizen would be counted as one person.

The third section was intended to be strict with members of the Confederacy who fought against the United States. It required a two-thirds vote of Congress to allow leaders of the Confederacy to regain their citizenship or hold office. To be allowed to hold a federal office, former confederates had to swear an oath to uphold the constitution. Section four said the federal government would not repay Confederate debts. Section five means what it says, Congress will enforce the provisions of the 14th amendment.

Short movie

A short movie, short film, or short is any movie not long enough to be considered a feature film (movie). The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences defines a short film as "an original motion picture that has a running time of 40 minutes or less, including all credits". However, the term is used by many as a catchall for anything less than 90 minutes in length. A feature film or movie usually runs from 90 to 120 minutes but can be as long as 180 minutes. There are other standards for short films. The Oberhausen short film festival defines a short as 35 minutes. The BBC Short Film Festival, the Academy Awards, and Clermont-Ferrand use 40 minutes. The San Francisco, Uppsala, and Kraków are among those using a limit of 60 minutes.

Short films or movies are sometimes called short subjects. Before 1910 all American movies were short subjects. Another term used for short films is avant-garde or "avant-garde short films". The term featurette originally was used for a movie or film longer than a short subject, but shorter than a standard feature film. Documentaries are almost always short films. So are many training films.

Short films are usually made by independent filmmakers and are not for profit. They are made with a low budget or no budget at all. Shorts are usually funded by film grants, non profit organizations, Sponsors, or personal funds. Short films are generally used by filmmakers to gain experience. They are also used to prove their talent in order to gain funding for future films. They want to attract private investors, entertainment companies, or film studios. Most film festivals show feature films or movies but also show short films. Some short films are shown along with a feature film.

During World War II, the US kept radio silence about military information including weather. The government was aware that German U-boats patrolled the coastal waters. Hurricane-warning flags were posted at coast guard stations and post offices. But weather forecasters wanted the public to know this was a monster storm. The Hurricane Warning Centers in Miami, San Juan, Washington DC and Boston issued a total of 51 warnings. In New York city alone there were thousands of phone calls made and received between September 12 and 15.

On September 9, 1944, it was first discovered just northeast of Puerto Rico. It was already at hurricane strength. Weather reconnaissance aircraft discovered the eye of the storm over the northern part of the Bahamas. The Miami office of the National Hurricane Center named it "Great Atlantic Hurricane" because of its great size. For the next few days it moved steadily in a west-northwest direction. On September 12, 1944, reconnaissance aircraft reported the storm was growing stronger. At this time the winds were reported at over 150 mph and it was about 500 miles across.

At 10 pm on 14 September the hurricane made landfall on eastern Long Island. At this point it was a category 3 hurricane. It passed just south of Boston, Massachusetts. It moved out to sea at 1:00 am on 15 September. The storm weakened into a tropical storm as it passed near the coast of Maine. It then moved into New Brunswick,Canada. On 15 September it became extratropical. It then merged with another weather system southwest of Greenland.

The hurricane caused a great deal of damage to World War II military ships. Five ships were sunk. The destroyer USS "Warrington" capsized with a loss of 248 men. The minesweeper "YMS-409" also capsized. The United States Coast Guard Cutters "Bedloe" and "Jackson" sank off the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Between the two 47 men were lost. The Coast Guard Lightvessel "Vineyard Sound" was sunk. The entire crew was lost.

New Jersey was one of the hardest hit states. Nine were killed and 390 were injured. More than 400 homes were completely destroyed with about 3,000 damaged. Atlantic City got the worst part of the storm. Heavy flooding and high winds caused a great deal of damage. Reports said there were tidal waves 50 to 60 feet high.

Doctor Zhivago

Doctor Zhivago is a 1965 epic romantic drama movie. The movie is about life in Russia before and during World War I and during the Russian Civil War from 1917 to 1922. The movie is based on a novel of the same name. It was written by Boris Pasternak. The movie was banned in the Soviet Union. It could not be made there and also could not be shown in theatres after it was released. It was first shown in Russia in 1994. The movie was directed by David Lean.

Critics complained when the movie was released because its running time was over three hours. Also, critics thought that the history in the movie was not told correctly. Over time, opinions changed. Now it is thought by the public to be one of David Lean's best movies. It was ranked by the American Film Institute in 1998 as the 39th greatest American movie of all time.

The movie won five Academy Awards. It was entered into the 1966 Cannes Film Festival.

The "Doctor Zhivago" novel was published in 1957 outside Russia, in Western countries. The book caused both praise and controversy. Some of Boris Pasternak's story had been available in Samizdat for some time after World War II. But the novel did not get written until 1956.

The book had to be smuggled out of the Soviet Union, because their government banned it for its views against Communism. It was taken by a trusted friend to an Italian publisher who printed and released it. Many people heard about the book because of the Soviet Union actions taken against the novel. It became very popular in the non-communist world. It spent 26 weeks at the top of the "New York Times" best-seller list.

A great poet who wrote about how he felt, Pasternak was awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize in Literature. Even though the award was given for his poetry, it was known that the prize was mainly for "Doctor Zhivago". The Soviet Union saw this Nobel Prize as a personal attack against their government itself. Pasternak was said to be a traitor by their leaders, so he refused to accept the Prize. The public now thought Pasternak was a Cold War symbol of rebellion against Soviet communism.

The movie plot was the same as the novel in some ways, but some changes were made. Many critics said that the movie gave too much attention to the love story between Zhivago and Lara. This downplayed the events of the Russian Revolution and the civil war that it caused.

Mariano Taccola

Mariano di Jacopo detto il Taccola (1381 – ca. 1453), called Taccola (the crow), was an Italian artist, engineer and administrator. He lived during the early Renaissance period. He wrote two important books, "De ingeneis" and "De machinis". These hand-drawn books have drawings of many new (for his time) machines. There are also descriptions of the machines. Leonardo da Vinci and other people used his books in the later Renaissance.

Mariano Taccola was born in Siena in 1381. His father was a wine merchant named Jacopo. His mother's name was Madonna Nofria (Bacci). The name he was given at his baptism was Mariano Daniello. Taccola himself used the name Ser Mariani Jacobi decti. He had many different jobs. Records show Taccola had been a wood carver who made church ornaments. He was a public official, a secretary to a hospital. Taccola was also a sculptor and an engineer. Most of the details about his life come from his books. Taccola started his first book, "De ingeneis", in 1419. He completed it in 1433. The book probably led to his being appointed supervisor of roads and hydraulic engineering. He retired from this position sometime in the 1440s. Taccola's second book, "De machinis", appeared in 1449. It contained updated drawings from "De ingeneis" as well as many new drawings. It appears he lived in Siena his entire life. Taccola received a pension from the city for his administrative work. In 1453 he stopped receiving his pension meaning he may have died that year. But in another document dated 1453 he wrote he had become a friar in the "Order of San Jacomo". 

Taccola was one of the first artist-engineers of the Renaissance. He invented a new way of making technical drawings. This is called an exploded-view. In these diagrams, an object's parts are shown separated and with indications of how they fit together. After Taccola died, his work was largely neglected until the 20th century. Only after 1960 were his works printed. This was based on the discovery of his original works in two museums. These originals were much better than copies, which scholars had been familiar with. Now their importance is more widely recognized. 

Taccola was familiar with several sienese artists and architects. Jacopo della Quercia was his daughter's godfather. He once interviewed the Florentine architect Filippo Brunelleschi and recorded it in one of his folios. Brunelleschi advised Taccola not to explain his inventions to others who did not understand machines. He said: "Therefore the gifts given to us by God must not be relinquished to those who speak ill of them and who are moved by envy or ignorance. To disclose too much of one's inventions and achievements is one and the same thing as to give up the fruit of one's ingenuity... the ignorant and inexperienced understand nothing, not even when things are explained to them; their ignorance moves them promptly to anger; they remain in their ignorance because they want to show themselves learned, which they are not"

The movie continues the plot of the 1986 movie Aliens. Heading back to Earth a spacecraft has flight difficulties. It crash lands on a planet called Fiorina 161. The crash kills everyone aboard except Lieutenant Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). Fiorina 161 is a planet where the temperature averages forty degrees below zero. It was a maximum security prison colony. A group of ex-prisoners chose to remain on the planet. They belong to a sect identified as "an apocalyptic millennarian fundamentalist Christian sect." The first thing Ripley has to do is shave her head because of the lice there. She is threatened by being the only female on the planet. While waiting for a rescue ship it is discovered that one of the aliens Ripley and the others were fighting before has found its way to Fiorina 161. A pet dog is the first victim. Then ex-prisoners begin disappearing. They have no weapons to fight the alien monster, only fire. Then Ripley learns she has a little alien inside her. Worse, it's a queen capable of producing thousands of eggs. Ripley thinks it happened while she was asleep in her pod. The creature, called a Xenomorph, refuses to kill Ripley because of the embryo inside her.


The movie had a difficult production, with various screenwriters and directors getting involved in the project. Shooting began without a finished script. The movie was the big-budget debut for the young David Fincher. He was brought into the project after a proposed version with Vincent Ward at the helm was cancelled well into pre-production.

Adjustable wrench

An adjustable wrench (US) or adjustable spanner (UK) is a wrench with a "jaw" of adjustable width. It can be used with different sizes of fastener head (nut or bolt). This type of tool may have other names in other parts of the world. 

Several people are claimed as its inventor. Edwin Beard Budding (1796–1846), an engineer from Stroud, England, is one. On 22 September 1885 Enoch Harris received US patent 326868 for his spanner that permitted both the jaw width and the angle of the handles to be adjusted and locked. Some countries refer to it as a "Swedish key" after Swedish inventor Johan Petter Johansson. In 1891 he got a patent for an improved adjustable spanner which is still used today. Johansson improved the 1842 invention of another English engineer Richard Clyburn. 

A monkey wrench is a heavyweight wrench in which the jaw width is set by a spinning ring fixed under the sliding lower jaw. In 1840, Worcester, Massachusetts knife manufacturer Loring Coes invented it. It was based on the wrench used on English 18th-century coach wheels. Coe patented it in 1841 and the tools were advertised and sold in the United States as "monkey wrenches".

Northern Sotho language

Northern Sotho ("Sesotho sa Leboa" in Northern Sotho) is an African language mainly spoken by people living in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. 

Northern Sotho is one of the eleven official languages of South Africa. It is spoken by almost 4 618 500 people, or 8.4% of South Africans at home (2011-census). Northern Sotho is part of the Sotho language family.

Sotho language

Southern Sotho ("Sesotho" in Southern Sotho) is an African language mainly spoken by people living in Lesotho and the Free State Province of South Africa. 

Southern Sotho is one of the two official languages of Lesotho and one of the eleven official languages of South Africa. It is spoken by almost 6,024,000 people, or 7% of South Africans at home (2011 census). Southern Sotho is part of the Sotho language family.

Southern Sotho contains many loanwords from Zulu.

Bolt

A bolt is a form of grooved fastener with an external helical male thread that engages the interior female thread of a nut. Bolts are closely related to, and often confused with, screws.

A screw is different from a bolt because it does not take a nut, and its helical thread is used to penetrate (cut into) a softer material (such as wood).

This distinction is not always clear, and sometimes screws are regarded as bolts without a nut.


Tswana language

The Tswana language (or Setswana) is a language spoken in southern Africa. About five million people speak it. It is a Bantu language. It belongs to the Niger–Congo language family within the Sotho languages. It is closely related to the Northern- and Southern Sotho languages.

Tswana is an official language of Botswana. Most Tswana speakers are in South Africa, where four million people speak the language.

Nut (hardware)

A nut is a type of fastener with a threaded hole. Nuts are almost always used with a mating bolt to fasten parts together. Because of this "nut and bolt" or "nuts and bolts" are a term which recognise their pairing.

Like bolt heads, their shape is usually hexagonal, because this is best for gripping with tools. Nuts are graded with strength ratings like their respective bolts. For example, an ISO property class 10 nut can support the bolt proof strength load of an ISO property class 10.9 bolt without stripping its thread (the inside spiral groove).

Corn snake

The corn snake ("Pantherophis guttatus") is a North American species of rat snake that kills small prey by constriction. 

Corn snakes are found throughout the southeastern and central United States. They are often kept as pets. They reach a moderate size of . In the wild, they usually live around 6–8 years, but in captivity can live to be up to 23 years old or longer. 

Corn snakes look similar to the venomous copperhead snake and are often killed because of this similarity. Corn snakes are harmless and beneficial to humans. They are one of the most common snakes kept as pets, alongside the garter snake and ball python. Corn snakes lack venom and help control populations of wild rodent pests that damage crops and spread disease. They can be distinguished from copperheads by their brighter colors, slender build and lack of heat-sensing pits.

Although the corn snake is distinguished by its bright red orange colored scales, possible mutations can occur completely rejecting these pigments, changing its appearance. The two-color mutations that are known to occur is albinism and anerythrism. Snakes that are homozygous for albinism lack the black pigment, and the ones that are homozygous for anerythrism lack the red pigment.

The corn snake is named for the species' regular presence near grain stores, where it preys on mice and rats that eat harvested corn. The "Oxford English Dictionary" cites this usage as far back as 1675. Some sources maintain that the corn snake is so-named because the distinctive, nearly-checkered pattern of the snake's belly scales resembles the kernels of variegated corn. Regardless of the name's origin, the corn reference can be a useful mnemonic for identifying them. Their diet in the wild mainly consists of rodents, small amphibians, birds and/or their eggs, other types of eggs, and so on. They're not known for eating insects, though. In captivity they're usually fed a steady diet of pinky mice and other types of creatures such as the ones above.

Screw thread

A screw thread, often shortened to thread, is a helical structure. It is a ridge wrapped around a cylinder or cone in the form of a helix, with the former being called a "straight" thread and the latter called a "tapered" thread.

The tightening of a nut to a bolt is like driving a wedge into a gap until it sticks through friction and plastic deformation (how the surfaces of the two objects slightly squash together).

A screw thread is one of the six simple machines which give mechanical advantage. 

The mechanical advantage of a screw thread depends on its "lead", which is the linear distance the screw travels in one turn or revolution.

Planomicrobium glaciei

Planomicrobium glaciei is a species of bacteria. The cells are first coccoid. After some time they change to rods. The bacterium use the aerobic respiration with oxygen. The bacterium does not form endospores. It belongs to the gram-positive Firmicutes.

South Magnetic Pole

The South Magnetic Pole is the point on the southern hemisphere where the magnetic lines are directly pointing upward. In other words, if there were a magnet inside the earth axis (from north to south), the South Magnetic pole would be at its southern end. Because the magnetic field of the Earth changes, the exact location of this pole does as well. In 2020, it was estimated to be at , placing it off the coast of Antarctica. In 2015, it was at . That point lies outside the Antarctic Circle. Due to polar drift, the pole is moving northwest by about 10 to 15 kilometers per year. Its current distance from the actual Geographic South Pole is approximately 2860 km. The nearest permanent science station is Dumont d'Urville Station. Wilkes Land contains a large gravitational mass concentration.

Urban heat island

An urban heat island, or UHI, is what happens when a city in urban area is warmer than the area around it. It happens because things in cities like concrete take longer to give off heat than things like trees, which are common outside of cities, because of urbanization. The urban heat island effect is stronger at night and when there is not much wind. Cities can be 3°C warmer than nearby countryside. 

In country areas, a large part of the incoming solar energy goes to evaporate water from vegetation and soil. But cities have less vegetation and soil. In cities, most of the sun’s energy is absorbed by urban building and asphalt paving. During warm daylight hours, there is less evaporative cooling in cities than in country areas. So, surface temperatures rise higher in cities than in country areas. 

Also, vehicles, factories, and industrial and domestic heating and cooling units give off more heat in cities. This problem is growing. This effect causes the city to become 2 to 10 F (1 to 6 C) warmer than surrounding rural areas.

Zwartbles sheep

Zwartbles sheep are a large breed of domestic sheep. This breed first came from Holland in the north of the Netherlands. They were used to make sheep milk as well as lamb and mutton. They were often kept in the same fields as the dairy cattle. 

They were brought over to Great Britain in the late 1900s. They are not very common and now live in the north of England. The sheep have reddish brown wool, black legs with four white socks, a white tip on the tail, and a black face with a white stripe. They do not have horns. The lambs look the same but have jet black wool. These are a tame and friendly sheep, but are difficult to look after.

They are bred for their meat and not for their wool, because it is very dark and cannot be dyed. The meat from Zwartbles sheep does not have much fat and tastes sweet. 

The Zwartbles are large sheep: ewes (females) weigh an average of , and rams (males) . 
Being so large, they often have three or four lambs. Having so many babies can cause problems for the mother in giving birth. 

These sheep have become less popular in Holland. There are so few there that they are listed as being rare by the Dutch Rare Breed Survival trust in the mid-1970s. 
The first Zwartbles were imported to the United Kingdom in the early 1990s. A group for their farmers and owners, the Zwartbles Sheep Association, was formed in 1995.

Zwartbles are now mainly used for breeding lambs, and for their meat and wool. Already coming from the cold, wet, windy climate in the Netherlands, they can live in good health at various altitudes in Great Britain. Some Zwarbles are now shown in agricultural shows to be judged. The wool of these show animals is often trimmed to remove the brown wool tips. This leaves a tight black fleece showing as the primary colour.

Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance

Carrier Sense Multiple Access With Collision Avoidance or CSMA/CA is an access method (or protocol, or rule) used in Ethernet networks. In CSMA/CA, before a host sends information on the wire, it will "sense" to see if the wire is free of signals. If the wire is free, the host sends a piece of test data on the wire to see if it collides with other data. If the test data does not collide, the host goes on to send the real data on the wire.

Debt bondage

Bonded labour or debt bondage (or debt slavery) is a term used to refer to a situation where someone (a debtor) has to work for the person who lent him money. Generally, the conditions of this form of forced labour are close to slavery. Bonded labour is one of the most common forms of modern-day slavery-like conditions. Usually, the person working gets paid very little money in return for very hard work. Very often, the exact amount to be re-paid is not defined clearly. The person doing the bonded labour will never be able to pay off the debt through work. 

A regular work contract usually gives rights to the person being employed, and the amount of work. In a normal working contract, difficult, dangerous or exhausting work will usually get paid better. This is not the case with debt bondage. 

Debt bondage is banned by the Convention of United Nation on slavery in 1956.

Bernoulli distribution

The Bernoulli distribution is a probability distribution. It takes a value of 1 with probability "p" and a value of 0 with probability 1-"p". It is sometimes written as formula_1. It is used in probability theory and statistics. It is named after a Swiss scientist Jacob Bernoulli.

A Bernoulli distribution is useful because it can be used to approximate the outcomes of an experiment (such as tossing a coin) as a range of percentages. It represents a "yes or no" type experiment. If the experiment succeeds, then it is given the value 1. If the experiment does not succeed, it is given value 0. This can be used, for example, in tossing a coin, where "1" means it lands on "heads", and "0" means it lands on "tails" (or the other way around).

This distribution has only one parameter, the probability of a success ("p"). In fact, Bernoulli distribution is the binomial distribution with "n"=1, and "n" independent and identically distributed Bernoulli distributions also give rise to binomial distribution.

Adams–Onís Treaty

The Adams-Onís Treaty (also called the Florida treaty) was a treaty between Spain and the United States of America in 1819. This treaty gave the state of Florida to the United States. It settled a standing border dispute between the two countries. It established the U.S- Mexican border. 

The treaty was considered a triumph of American diplomacy. It came at a time of increasing difficulties related to Spain's territorial boundaries in North America. This was with both the United States and Great Britain following the American Revolution. There were also tensions during the Latin American Wars of Independence. Florida had become a problem for Spain. It could not afford to send settlers or garrisons. 

The treaty was signed in Washington, DC on February 22, 1819. It was ratified in Madrid, Spain on October 24, 1820. The treaty actually went into effect on February 22, 1821. Madrid decided to cede the territory of Florida to the United States. This was in exchange for settling the boundary dispute along the Sabine River in Texas. The treaty established the boundary of U.S. territory. It recognized the claims of the United States through the Rocky Mountains and west to the Pacific Ocean. In exchange the U.S. paid residents' claims against the Spanish government up to a total of $5,000,000. The United States also gave up its claims on parts of Spanish Texas west of the Sabine River and other Spanish areas, under the agreements in the Louisiana Purchase. Adams-Onis was a key event in determining the U.S.-Mexico border.

1860 United States presidential election

The United States presidential election of 1860 was held on Tuesday, November 6, 1860. The election of President Abraham Lincoln served as a trigger for the outbreak of the American Civil War. The United States had been divided during the 1850s on questions surrounding the expansion of slavery and the rights of slave owners. In 1860, these issues broke the Democratic Party into three factions. Each group felt they could best defeat the Republican Party candidate. 
In April 1860 Democrats met in Charleston, South Carolina to select a candidate for the upcoming presidential election. The convention was in complete chaos. Northern Democrats wanted to nominate Stephen A. Douglas. Southern Democrats would not support him because he supported new states having the popular sovereignty right to choose whether they would allow slavery. The convention could not agree on a candidate. Later, in a separate convention, the Northern Democrats met again and chose Douglas. The Southern Democrats chose John C. Breckinridge. He was the Vice President of the United States under President James Buchanan.

Later, a third group, The newly formed Constitutional Union Party chose John Bell as their candidate. The party included a few southern democrats who were against slavery. It also included members of the Whig Party and the Know Nothing party. The Constitutional Union Party was against secession and neutral on the issue of slavery. Bell himself was an ex-democrat.

The Republican party saw an opportunity when the Democrats were split. They met in Chicago on May 16–18. William H. Seward was the favorite among many. Abraham Lincoln had become known as a result of his debates with Stephen A. Douglas. He had the advantage the convention was held in Chicago, the center of his support. After two ballots, there was no clear choice. On the third ballot the republicans chose Lincoln.

Lincoln's position on the issue of slavery was known from his senatorial debates with Stephen Douglas in 1858. In one debate he said, "I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free." One of his most memorable quotes he stated, "A house divided against itself cannot stand." Even so, he was considered a moderate on the issue of slavery. He knew he could not end slavery in the south in one step. Instead he only spoke out against slavery in new American territories.

Lincoln won the election with 1,866,452 votes. Douglas received 1,376,957 votes. John Breckinridge and John Bell shared the remaining 1,438,660 votes cast. Lincoln won the majority of the electoral college giving him the presidency. But he won without carrying a single Southern state. Before Lincoln's inauguration as president, seven Southern states declared their secession. In his inaugural address, Lincoln spoke to the Southern states. He said, "In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war". He went on to say, "The government will not assail you. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. You have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government, while I shall have the most solemn one to 'preserve, protect, and defend' it." Lincoln called them friends and told them we are not enemies. Unfortunately by this time Jefferson Davis was already the president of the Confederacy. They were later joined by Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, and Tennessee. Two states, Kentucky and Missouri, attempted to remain neutral.

On April 12, 1861, the first shots of the Civil War were fired at Fort Sumter, South Carolina.

Midge

Midge is a common term for many types of small fly. They are all in a suborder, the Nematocera.

They are found on practically every land area except permanently dry deserts and the frozen zones. Some midges, such as many Phlebotominae (sand fly) and Simuliidae (black fly), are vectors of various diseases. Others are prey items for insectivores, such as various frogs and swallows.

The highland midge of Scotland ("Culicoides impunctatus") is present in huge numbers. It is a significant blood-sucking pest. It is found in upland and lowland areas (fens, bogs and marshes) especially in the north west of Scotland from late spring to late summer.

The habits of midges vary greatly from species to species, though within any particular family midges commonly have similar ecological roles. Examples of families which include midges are:

Shiaphobia

Anti-Shi'ism (pronounced: Anti, She, ism) or Shiaphobia is the prejudice against or hatred of Shia Muslims. Shia Muslims make up somewhere between 10-13% of Muslims worldwide. Sunni Islam and Shia Islam split because the two groups have different beliefs about the type of person that could become a caliph, a top leader of Muslim peoples. Shias believe the leader should be related to the Prophet Muhammad. Sunnis however believe the leader should of been chosen for his ability to lead the community. 

The two groups have lived together peacefully for centuries. Shia and Sunni have not only lived together they have intermarried in many cases. But modern politics and recent events have sparked new fighting between the two groups. Modern Anti-Shi'ism violence is just a part of the overall conflict. It is one result of the collapse of authoritarian rule in the region.

Controlled burn

A controlled burn (sometimes also called a prescribed fire) is a fire that is started on purpose, and kept under control. It is done by people who are trained in controlling a fire, with the right equipment and the right weather conditions. It is done to help the environment or to make an area safer for people.

This is not the same as a practice fire, where a firefighter crew might start a fire in a house or other building that is going to be destroyed. They use it for practice, to learn how to enter a burning house safely and how to put out a house fire. Controlled burns, on the other hand, are done outdoors in forests or prairies.

There are several reasons why a controlled burn may take place. In some areas, there may be too much dry wood and dead plants. If a fire started there that was not controlled (like arson, an accident, or a lightning strike), that fire could become dangerous. So by having trained people there, and burning it carefully, then the fire won't be as hot and won't get out of control.

Another reason is to help nature. Some plants need fire so their seeds can start to grow, some animals prefer to live in places that have been recently burned, and sometimes it helps to get rid of weeds. Also, the ash on the ground is a quick fertilizer and helps return nutrients to the soil.

Sometimes it is done to help people. It can clear an area of brush and make it easier to see and move around. Hunter-gatherer people would do this to chase game into an area where they can kill the animal for food. This is becoming rare.

From the fire triangle, it is known that a fire needs fuel, oxygen and heat. To control a fire, removing one of these three things will cause the fire to go out. To keep the fire in the area it is supposed to be in, the fire can be smothered, removing oxygen. Or it can be sprayed with water, removing the heat. And the fire finishes when there is no more fuel.

Generally, the "back fire" is started first. This is the fire that burns into the wind, and moves slowly. This is a smaller, safer fire, and is easier to control. It can be started next to a trail or stream or other "fire break" that keeps the fire from moving downwind.

After the back fire is in place, then the "head fire" is started. It will burn downwind (travels with the wind). This will burn faster and hotter. When it reaches the back fire, there is no more fuel for the fire, and it dies out.

The list can depend on the group doing the burn, but often includes:

Smith v. Allwright

Smith v. Allwright (1944), was a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court. The decision made it unconstitutional to keep African Americans from voting in a Democratic Party primary in Texas. By extension it covered white primaries in all states. It overturned "Grovey v. Townsend" (1935) which had allowed the Democratic party to hold all-white primaries that excluded black voters.

The Reconstruction Amendments to the United States Constitution gave African Americans freedom from slavery, citizenship and the right to vote. But many former slave states came up with ways to keep blacks from voting. These included poll taxes, literacy tests and complex voter registration laws. While these worked in most southern states, it did not work in Texas. The party needed the Hispanic vote but wanted to exclude blacks. They needed also to split the black and hispanic vote. Texas, like most southern states, was a one-party state. The Democratic party controlled politics. The state and local primary elections decided which candidate would ultimately win office in the general election. Democrats in Texas used the "white primary" to serve their purposes. It prohibited non-whites from joining the Democratic party and taking part in primary elections. It could be used also to exclude Mexican Americans in areas of the state where the party did not need them. The Reconstruction Amendments applied to the state. But in "Grovey v. Townsend" the state of Texas was allowed to pass on its responsibility for protecting black voter rights to a private organization—the Democratic party. This allowed Texas to use the all-white primary.

In another decision, "Grovey v. Townsend" (1935), the Supreme Court decided that the Democratic Party was a private organization. Their state convention could decide who can be a member. Lonnie E. Smith, a Houston dentist, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) decided to fight this decision.
