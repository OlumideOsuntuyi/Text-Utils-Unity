Wulfstan was a native speaker of Old English, specifically the West-Saxon dialect. He also spoke Latin and Old Norse (which was brought to England by people of Scandinavian origin). 

Wulfstan wrote most of his works in Old English. Other works he wrote in Latin. In his writing, there are some particular words that no other author used. Old English words that are exclusive to Wulfstan’s works are: "sibleger" ‘incest’, "tōfēsian" ‘to rout’, "ægylde" ‘uncompensated’, and "morðwyrhta" ‘murderer’. 

Wulfstan’s unique words of Scandinavian origin are: "þræl" ‘slave, servant’ (Old Norse "þræll", Old English "þēow"), "bōnda" ‘husband, peasant’ (Old Norse "bóndi", Old English "ceorl"), "eorl" ‘nobleman of highest rank’ (Old Norse "jarl", Old English "ealdormann"). Those words are related to the topic of social classes. Another important word is "lagu" ‘divine law’ (Old Norse "lag", Old English "ǣw"). 

Wulfstan is known for his recognizable writing style. Wulfstan plays with sounds in his prose. He uses alliteration (repetition of sounds at the beginning of two or more successive words). Two-stress rhythm is very typical for him. Wulfstan often repeats distinctive collocations ("unrihta fela" ‘much unlawfulness’) and rhyming binominals (two words linked by conjunction, for example "stalu and cwalu" ‘theft and murder’, wær and wis ‘aware and wise’), intensifiers ("swyðe þearle" ‘very severely’). His style is close to Old English poetry. He uses punctuation to make sure his texts can be read aloud easily. 

Some of his works can be recognized through his handwriting and text organization. In his homilies, he uses wide margins. His writing is perfectly aligned on the left side. 

Wulfstan used the Latin pen-name Lupus (‘wolf’) in many of his works. There are other works that are recognized as his because of his unique writing style. Twenty-six sermons are recognized as Wulfstan’s based on his style. 

The four categories of Wulfstan’s works are: homilies, legal texts, philosophical texts, and poetry. 

The Homilies focus on themes such as: eschatology (study of the end of the world, specifically related to Christianity in Wulfstan’s works), the afterlife, the Judgement Day, and the Antichrist theme (Wulfstan warns about fake Christ wanting to seduce men). Wulfstan wanted to warn about possible corruptions of faith. He also encouraged loving God. 

Some of Wulfstan’s legal texts are law handbooks about the laws during the reigns of different rulers. His "The Institutes of Polity" analyses the roles of the state and the Church. 

Wulfstan collected books and texts. He put many of those texts together into a collection called Wulfstan’s "Commonplace Book". This collection is divided into 10 blocks. Each block focuses on one theme. For example "" contains the laws related to Christian Church.

Inauguration of Andrew Johnson

The inauguration of Andrew Johnson as the 17th president of the United States happened on April 15, 1865, at Kirkwood House in Washington, D.C. It was held after Abraham Lincoln, the president of the United States, was killed. The inauguration marked the start of Andrew Johnson's only term (a partial term of ) as president.

Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase administered the presidential oath of office to Johnson. This inauguration was the third one to not be held on a scheduled date, which was normally March 4. 

After being sworn in, President Johnson gave a short inaugural address that was impromptu (unprepared). In his speech, he asked Lincoln's cabinet to stay with him, and then attacked the Confederate States of America. One person who heard the speech said, "It would have been better had he been struck dumb."

Some newspaper reports said Johnson had gotten heavily drunk, in that when President Lincoln's aides came to get to Johnson, they were not able to wake him up for a short time. The reports said that when Johnson was awoken, "he had puffy eyes and his hair was caked with mud from the street," and that a barber and doctor came to clean him up for the ceremony, which most reports said went smoothly. 

However, this has been disagreed on, according to other reports believed more accurate by some.

Domain-driven design

Domain-driven design is a way of modelling and building software systems. The basic idea is that the model of the software should also be a model of the application domain. In domain-driven design the software models certain aspects of the problem. People will use certain terms, which have a very specific meaning. This meaning is linked to the problem domain in which it is used (called a context). In different contexts, the term may have a different meaning. 

In order to connect the different contexts, a common language is needed (where everyone agrees on the specific meaning of the terms used). Eric Evans, who created the term Domain-driven design calles it ubiquitous language, and defines it as follows: “A language structured around the domain model and used by all team members to connect all the activities of the team with the software.”.

Torre Cecilia

The Torre Cecilia or Torione Cecilia is a mountain on Lake Como in the province of Lecco, Lombardy, northern Italy. It is part of the Gruppo delle Grigne; is located in the territory of Lierna above Lake Como.

The peak reaches 1,800 metres in altitude.

The particular shaped mountain, adjacent to the Torre del Cinquantenario, was designed by Leonardo da Vinci between 1505 and 1510, during his continuous stays on the shores of Lake Como mentioned in his Codex Atlanticus, the work is part of the Windsor Codex (on sheet 12406).

Torrione Cecilia and Torre del Cinquantenario are the Dolomite group located in front of Rifugio Rosalba (1730 m.), and one of the most characteristic corners of Grignetta together with Alpe di Lierna.

The mountain was at the center of enterprises in 1923 with Fanny Guzzi.

There are many landscapes of Lake Como and its mountains drawn by Leonardo da Vinci, the object of his studies during his stays in Lierna. Leonardo da Vinci will study in the mountains above Lierna, from Porta di Prada to Rocca di Baiedo, from Fiumelatte to Bellagio, which "unites the two opposites into one", up to Monte San Martino, Resegone and the "Giardino di Pietra", not only the mountains but also the streams and caves beneath them, which radiate as he said like the veins of the human body. For Leonardo da Vinci, the mountains of Lake Como contain all the secret of the antiquity of the world, an essential part of the great cosmic cycle that binds rock, water, sky and the belly of the earth together. Leonardo da Vinci not only shows a theoretical interest in the mountains, but explores them in person, becoming a mountaineer in his own way.

His travels to Lierna where he stayed to explore all the surrounding areas testify to the rocks, mountains, peaks, woods, landscapes that are present in many of his famous paintings. The most significant Alpine representation dates back to the second Milanese period: around 1511 Leonardo depicts a mountain group with precise outlines, in a small red chalk drawing.

In the drawings of the Windsor code there is a view of medieval Lecco, as well as drawings of snowy crests that belong to the landscape of the eastern branch of Lake Como, there are also drawings of the central massif of the Grigne.

Rates (tax)

Rates a sort of property tax in the United Kingdom and some other countries.

In England they were started as part of the Poor Law. They were agreed in the Act for the Relief of the Poor 1601. They were first used to pay for workhouses and later for building roads. They paid for local government"." Buildings were given a rateable value based on the rent it could fetch. This meant that people with more valuable buildings paid more. The rateable value was to be calculated again every 5 years, but this was unpopular and often didnt happen. In 1990 Margaret Thatcher tried to replace it with the poll tax. This only lasted 3 years and then there was Council Tax.

People who do not have a water meter are charged for water according to the rateable value of their building. 

Businesses still have to pay rates based on the value of their buildings. The rate is set by central government and is the same for the whole of England. The money is collected by local councils. This means that places where people are richer produce more money.

Charities and community amateur sports clubs only have to pay 20%.

Yellowstone cutthroat trout

"Main article: Cutthroat trout"
The Yellowstone cutthroat trout ("Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri") is a subspecies of the cutthroat trout ("Oncorhynchus clarkii"). It is a freshwater fish in the salmon family (family Salmonidae). It lives in only to a few U.S. states. Its original range was upstream of Shoshone Falls on the Snake River and tributaries in Wyoming, across the Continental Divide in Yellowstone Lake and in the Yellowstone River and its tributaries downstream to the Tongue River in Montana. The species is also found in Idaho, Utah and Nevada.

The Yellowstone cutthroat trout is often golden brown with relatively big spots clustered toward its tail. Its body is compressed like most trout. 

Their population has decreased a little due to overfishing and mining. The most serious threats are interbreeding with introduced rainbow trout to make cutbows in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem.

Yellowstone cutthroat trout were never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River and their presence there is probably the result of accidental or illegal introductions.

Poor Law

The English Poor Law was an early sort of social security. The Act for the Relief of the Poor in 1601 gave parishes the job of supporting the "deserving poor" - people who couldn't work. People who had property in the parish had to pay rates. The money was used to pay for food and clothing for the poor. Each parish (there were about 1500) decided how they should do this. The parish was only responsible for people who were settled there. People who were not settled were sent back home. People who could work were given work to do. People who would not work could be put in a house of correction - a sort of prison.

After 1948 National Assistance started, instead of the Poor Law. There was still a means test but the earnings of sons and daughters were no longer counted.

Akha people

Akha refers to an ethnic group who speak the language of the same name. They mostly live in Burma and China. They also live in countries such as Thailand and Laos. They live in small villages of a high elevation, usually in mountains.

Their close ancestors are the Hani people and the Karen people.

They had made their way from China during the early 20th century. Civil war in Burma and Laos had led this ethnic group to move to Northern Thailand. Because of this, there are now about 80,000 people living in Thailand's northern provinces, such as Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai.

NHS targets

The National Health Service measures how well it is doing by setting what are called targets. These are things that can be counted. The targets are changed over time. The targets, and how they are measured, are different in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. None of the targets covering A&E, cancer or waiting times for planned care have been met in the UK since 2016. 

The target which gets most attention is the four-hour target in emergency departments. People should be seen, treated, and admitted to the hospital or sent home in under four hours. This was first measured in 2004. Since 2010 the number of people waiting more than 4 hours has gone up every year. July 2015 was the last month the target was met for 95% of patients in England. There were plans to change the target but in November 2022 it was to stay for at least 2 more years. 
In December 2022 more than 54,500 patients waited over 12 hours in emergency departments in England after doctors decided they needed a hospital bed. That is the highest-ever number and almost treble the figure for May. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine found that people over 80 were spending 16 hours in emergency departments waiting for care or a bed. In 2021 it was 9 hours. Such long waits mean people are less likely to recover. In the winter of 2022/3 there were long delays when ambulances arrived at hospitals and attempted to hand patients over to emergency staff.

In January 2023 Rishi Sunak said he would improve ambulance performance so an average response time of 30 minutes for category 2 emergency calls such as heart attacks and strokes would be met in 2023/24. In December, patients waited over 90 minutes. The official target is 18 minutes.

Larry Rivers

Larry Rivers (born Yitzroch Loiza Grossberg) (1923 – 2002) was an American artist, musician, and filmmaker.

Yitzroch Loiza Grossberg was born in the Bronx, New York. He changed his name to Larry Rivers in 1940 when he started his professional jazz career. He played the saxophone. After being in the U.S. Army Air Corps from 1942-43, he studied music at the Juilliard School of Music. There he met jazz musicians Miles Davis and Charlie Parker.

Rivers started painting in 1945 after he saw a show of Cubist paintings. He studied painting with Hans Hoffman, who made abstract expressionist paintings. In 1949 he had his first art show, and he became friends with the poets John Ashbery and Kenneth Koch. The next year he met poet Frank O'Hara. They began to work together on art and poems. They wrote many letters to each other until O'Hara died in 1966.

Rivers is connected to the Pop Art movement. Sometimes he used ordinary things in his paintings like a cigar box or the menu from a bar. One very large work, "History of the Russian Revolution: From Marx to Mayakovsky" used not just paint but actual things he found and attached to the canvas.

Rivers died of liver cancer in 2002 at his home in Southampton, New York.

Electronic health record

An electronic health record is a way of keeping the record of a person's health problems and treatments in electronic form so that it can be shared by health workers in different places. It can let people see their own health records and add to them. They also let scientists study many records so they can see patterns. They are also used to make bills. 

Getting these records shared over large areas and between different organisations takes a long time and costs a lot of money. When it is done it can save a lot of time and money.

Deadlines to set up shared electronic records in various parts of the English National Health Service have been missed several times. The latest plan was to "raise every NHS trust to a “core” level of digitisation by March 2025". When NHS Digital was closed in 2023 the money was mostly used for other things.

Electronic health record is the a more comprehensive version of Electronic medical record that includes data from all providers and settings where a patient receives care.

2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake

| type = Strike-slip, supershear, doublet

On 6 February 2023 at 04:17 a.m. TRT (01:17 a.m. UTC) there was a very strong earthquake in Gaziantep Province in southeastern Turkey, west of the city of Gaziantep at 04:17 AM TRT. The maximum Mercalli intensity was XII (Extreme), and a magnitude of 7.8 was given. It was equal to the 7.8 magnitude 1939 Erzincan earthquake as the strongest recorded earthquake to hit Turkey in modern times. Only the 7.8–8.0 magnitude 1668 North Anatolia earthquake was more powerful.

It is the deadliest earthquake in the history of Turkey since the 1268 Cilicia earthquake, and has surpassed the 1939 Erzincan earthquake, which killed 32,700–32,968 people, as the deadliest earthquake of the Republic of Turkey, and it is the deadliest worldwide since the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

After the earthquake, there were several aftershocks. The strongest of them had a magnitude of 7.5 that occurred in Kahramanmaraş.

As of 18 February, more than 46,400 deaths have been reported in total; more than 40,600 in Turkey and more than 5,800 in Syria. Most of the aid effort focused on Turkey. There is a civil war in Syria, and accessing the areas affected is more difficult. For this reason, the numbers given for Syria are likely less accurate than those given for Turkey.

The earthquake is estimated to have caused US$84.1 billion worth of damage in Turkey alone, making it the fourth-costliest earthquake on record, and one of the costliest natural disasters ever recorded.

The Turkish government carried out a damage assessment of 763,000 buildings in 13 provinces affected by the earthquake. It was determined that 41,791 buildings collapsed or were badly damaged and are in urgent need of demolition.

Many people have criticized the government. Critics point out the following issues, amongst others:


Virtual wards

A virtual ward is a way of giving support to people in their own homes who might have been in hospital. The idea in England was started in Croydon in 2006. It won four prizes at the 2006 Health Service Journal Awards

Sometimes this is done to keep people out of hospital, and sometimes to get them out. 

There is regular communication with nurses and doctors, some by telephone and some electronic. They will check the persons measurements so they can see if they are getting better or worse. Patients are reviewed daily and the ‘ward round’ may involve a home visit or take place through video technology. 

NHS England said in April 2022 it wanted to have at least 40 virtual beds per 100,000 population by December 2023.

The COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom caused huge pressure on hospitals. Remote patient monitoring using pulse oximeters meant that Covid patients could be kept out of hospital. The oximeter readings went into an app which analysed them in case medical attention was required. More virtual wards for other problems were started. In December 2022 there were about 10,000 patients treated in these “virtual” beds. In October 2023 it was agreed to expand the services for people suffering from heart failure. 

Pulitzer Prize for Poetry

The Pulitzer Prize for Poetry is one of the seven American Pulitzer Prizes given every year for "Books, Drama, and Music". It was first given in 1922.

Before the establishment of the award, the 1918 and 1919 Pulitzer cycles included three Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards (called at the time the Columbia University Poetry Prize) for poetry books funded by "a special grant from The Poetry Society."

In its first 92 years to 2013, the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry was awarded 92 times. Two were given in 2008, none in 1946. Robert Frost won the prize four times and some other poets won it more than once).

List of monarchs by time

A monarch is the head of a monarchy, a form of government in which a state is ruled by an individual who normally rules for life or until abdication, and typically inherits the throne by birth. Monarchs may be autocrats (as in all absolute monarchies) or may be ceremonial figureheads, exercising only limited or no reserve powers at all, with actual authority vested in a legislature and/or executive cabinet (as in many constitutional monarchies). In many cases, a monarch will also be linked with a state religion. Most states only have a single monarch at any given time, although a regent may rule when the monarch is a minor, not present, or otherwise incapable of ruling. Cases in which two monarchs rule simultaneously over a single state, as is the current situation in Andorra, are known as coregencies.

Healthcare in the United Kingdom

Most healthcare in the United Kingdom comes from the National Health Service. NHS treatment is free. There are charges for prescriptions, dentistry and glasses, but not everybody has to pay. The UK spent about 20% less per person than similar countries from 2010 to 2022.

In 2023 the Institute for Fiscal Studies produced a report saying that the number of people working for the NHS in England will rise from around 1.5 million in 2021-22 to between 2.3 and 2.4 million in 2036-37. That would be about one in 11 workers and half of all public sector workers.

People can pay for medical treatment. Some people pay because they dont want to wait. The NHS does not do cosmetic treatment. It will not do things the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence does not consider good value. Dentists and opticians are private businesses which mostly offer private treatment as well as NHS treatment. General practitioners are mostly private businesses but very few do private work.

NHS hospitals are allowed to do private work. It must not be more than 50% of their income. Only a few specialist NHS hospitals in London do a lot of private work.

In 2022 about 1.7 million people in the UK had private health insurance.

In 2020 there were 187 private hospitals in the United Kingdom with 7956 beds.

66,000 of the 200,000 non-NHS patients treated in the private hospitals between July and September 2022 paid themselves. The rest were covered by health insurance. Most of the private hospitals do work for the NHS as well as that paid for privately. As most do not have intensive care units they mostly do easier work on people who are younger and healthier so the NHS is left with the more difficult work. If things go wrong with private patients they may have to be sent by ambulance to an NHS hospital.

The number of people waiting a long time for tests or operations has gone up, so more people are paying for them to be done privately.

A lot more mental health care is run commercially than physical care. About 30% of mental health hospital beds are private, and 97% of "locked ward rehabilitation" beds. Almost all of this is paid for by the NHS.

Long term care in nursing homes in England is almost all private.

Josh Allen (quarterback)

Joshua Patrick Allen (born May 21, 1996) is an American football player. He is currently the starting quarterback for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). Allen played college football at Wyoming after transferring there from Reedley College, a community college in California, where he grew up. After playing well at Wyoming, he was selected by the Bills in the NFL Draft. He has since broken many records for the team. He has led them to the playoffs three times. He is known for his very strong arm while throwing the football and ability to run with the ball.

Allen grew up on a farm, which he often helped his family with. He played three sports. Because he didn't go to a more famous school and was quite skinny at the time, he was overlooked by many colleges with Division I football teams, including his local Fresno State Bulldogs. He had to play one year at a community college called Reedley College. The University of Wyoming gave him a chance after looking over his high school and Reedley College film.

After being rejected by Eastern Michigan and Fresno State one last time, Allen committed to Wyoming. He enrolled there before the 2015 season, after they gave him a scholarship. He had grown from 6'3" and 180 pounds to 6'5" and 210 pounds. In his first year, he broke his collarbone during his first game and had to sit out the rest of the year. He played through his next two years at Wyoming, helping the football team win many games.

Allen was picked 7th overall by the Buffalo Bills in the 2018 NFL Draft. In his first year, he struggled a bit, but had a good game against the Minnesota Vikings. He not only helped Buffalo win, but jumped over Anthony Barr, a linebacker just as big as he was. Allen missed four games after hurting his right elbow, but came back and did a little better. He finished with a very good game against the Miami Dolphins in which he scored 5 total touchdowns. He ended up breaking several rookie records for the team that year, even though he was not very accurate throwing the ball.

Allen improved a little more in 2019 and led the Bills to a playoff game. He did even better in 2020 after working on his technique. He passed for over 4,500 yards and 37 touchdowns. He completed nearly 70 percent of his passes, the fourth best rate that season, after two years of being one of the least accurate quarterbacks in the league. His rapid improvement surprised even some people at ESPN, who thought he would never play this well. The Bills also won 13 games that year and made it to the AFC Championship game, where they lost to Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs. Since then, the Bills have won two more divisional championships under Allen, who remains one of the best quarterbacks in the league. The Bills rematched with the Chiefs in the 2021 NFL playoffs, playing a tight game until the Chiefs won in overtime after tying the game with only 13 seconds left in the 4th quarter.

Three-strikes law

Three-strikes laws, or habitual offender laws, are laws that impact the punishment for a crime. Under a three-strikes law, if a person was convicted of three serious crimes, they will have to go to prison for life after their third crime. Three-strikes laws are used in many states of the USA. They are part of the United States Justice Department's Anti-Violence Strategy.

In most states, only crimes at the felony level qualify as serious crimes. In some places, only violent felonies qualify as serious.

The expression "Three strikes and you are out" comes from baseball. If a batter gets three strikes, they strike out.

The idea of giving longer prison sentences to repeat criminals is not new. Judges often consider earlier crimes when deciding the punishment. However, in most cases, laws did not require a longer prison sentence. There is a more recent history of mandatory prison sentences for repeat criminals. 

During Prohibition, the state of Michigan made one of the harshest laws against carrying alcohol in the nation. The law required a life sentence for those breaking alcohol laws for the fourth time. In 1928, Etta Mae Miller, a mother of four, was found guilty under this law. People were very angry at the state.

The first true "three-strikes" law was passed in 1993, when Washington voters approved Initiative 593. California passed its own in 1994, when their voters passed Proposition 184, with 72% voting yes and 28% voting no. The initiative proposed to the voters had the title of "Three Strikes and You're Out". This meant a person would go to prison for life after three violent or serious felonies.

The idea quickly spread to other states, but none of them chose to adopt a law as extensive as California's. By 2004, twenty-six states and the federal government had laws that can be called "three-strikes" laws. Each of these laws said that a third felony conviction brings a sentence of 20 years to life in prison. The person must serve 20 years before they can qualify for parole. A 1997 study found that in California, "the three-strikes law did not decrease serious crime or petty theft rates below the level expected on the basis of preexisting trends."

Huffman coding

Huffman coding is a way of encoding data. The method was developed in 1952, by David A. Huffman, at MIT. It was first published as "A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes", in 1952. The method is a prefix code, and a way of lossless data compression. The idea behind it is very simple: There's a dictionary that contains words, and how often they occur in the text. Each word is replaced by a variable-length code. Words that occur more often get shorter codes. The codes must not overlap and be unique. 

The output from Huffman's algorithm is a variable-length code table for encoding a source symbol (such as a character in a file). The algorithm constructs this table based on the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence ("weight") for each possible value of the source symbol. As in other entropy encoding methods, more common symbols are generally represented using fewer bits than less common symbols. Huffman's method can be efficiently implemented, finding a code in time linear to the number of input weights if these weights are sorted. Even though Huffman's method is optimal among methods encoding symbols separately, it is not always optimal among all compression methods - it is replaced with arithmetic coding or asymmetric numeral systems if a better compression ratio is required.

In 1951, David A. Huffman and his MIT information theory classmates were given the choice of a term paper or a final exam. The professor, Robert M. Fano, assigned a term paper on the problem of finding the most efficient binary code. Huffman, unable to prove any codes were the most efficient, was about to give up and start studying for the final when he hit upon the idea of using a frequency-sorted binary tree and quickly proved this method the most efficient.

In doing so, Huffman outdid Fano, who had worked with Claude Shannon to develop a similar code. Building the tree from the bottom up guaranteed optimality, unlike the top-down approach of Shannon–Fano coding.

Ballistic missile

A ballistic missile is a type of missile. It is only powered when it is launched. The power from its upward launch gives it all the energy it needs to get to its target. Most of its flight is not powered. Short-range ballistic missiles stay in the Earth's atmosphere. Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) are launched into space but fall back down to Earth. Both of them do not need the engine always on since in space and high in the atmosphere there is almost no wind resistance.

Ballistic missiles are different from cruise missiles, which have powered flight, move only in the atmosphere, and move aerodynamically. Imagine a cruise missile as a pilotless plane with a bomb flying low through the sky, while a ballistic missile is like throwing a dart with a bomb high into the sky to hit a target far away.

"Super Mario 64" was the first video game pannenkoek2012 played as a child. In 2013, while in college, pannenkoek2012 started making videos of him beating "Super Mario 64" levels without jumping. As of 2023, six of his videos have been seen a million or more times, and his most-watched video has 4.5 million views. He also has a second channel, UncommentatedPannen.

On January 12, 2016, pannenkoek2012 made a video where he said how to do "Watch for Rolling Rocks" in 0.5 A-presses. In August 2013, when pannenkoek2012 began working on the A-Button Challenge, 211 A-presses were required to complete "Super Mario 64".  As of February 2023, "Super Mario 64" can be completed in 13 A-presses.

Sweden Finns' Day

Sweden Finns' Day (; ) is an anniversary celebrated in Sweden on 24 February. The anniversary was approved by the Swedish Academy in 2010. It was held for the first time in 2011. 24 February was picked as the date of the anniversary because it was the birthday of Carl Axel Gottlund. He was a defender of speaking the Finnish language. The purpose of the day is to celebrate the history, language and culture of people with Finnish heritage living in Sweden. 

Towns that have large numbers of Finnish-speaking people raise the Sweden Finnish flag on Sweden Finns' Day. But this day is not a flag day approved by the government. The anniversary is observed in parts of Sweden, including Stockholm, Eskilstuna, Gothenburg, Västerås and Nykvarn. The day's events have included concerts, dance performances, writer visits, karaoke dances and theater plays for children. For example, in 2017, more than a thousand people attended the celebration at Stockholm City Hall. In 2013, the celebration was large in many places.

In 2019, the seal was selected by the listeners of Sveriges Radio's Finnish-language channel "Sveriges Radio Finska" as the national animal of the Sweden Finns.

SCP – Containment Breach

SCP – Containment Breach is a horror video game created by Joonas "Regalis" Rikkonen, based on fictional stories from the SCP Foundation wiki. The player is a human test subject, imprisoned in an underground testing facility which is used for containing and studying entities known as SCPs. The goal of the game is to escape from the facility during a breach of these anomalies while also avoiding security teams that are sent in to contain them. The game's map is randomly generated, and features multiple entities from the SCP wiki.

The game was released on April 15, 2012, and was supported with digital content updates until its most recent update 1.3.11 on July 29, 2018.

The player controls a prisoner named D-9341 as they attempt to escape an underground research facility during a breach of its contained entities, known as SCPs. During gameplay, the player walks around the facility collecting items in order to escape, while also being chased by multiple SCPs and armed guards, which must be avoided or else the player will be hurt or killed.

The game is set in a first-person perspective with the player in full control of D-9341, and is able to walk and sprint in any direction. Sprinting too long causes the player’s sprint meter to empty, and they must wait for it to recharge. One of the important game mechanics is the blink meter. During the entire gameplay, the blink meter will slowly decrease and eventually force the player to blink, but the player can also blink by pressing the space bar. This mechanic is in the game because of SCP-173, who moves and attacks based on whether or not the player can see them. The player can save and load games depending on difficulty, with the game's medium difficulty only allowing saving at certain points in the game, and the game's hardest difficulty not allowing saving at all.

The wing’s 10 fully refurbished galleries present a dialogue between works from ancient and traditional cultures and those by local and international contemporary artists, framed in a renewed intercultural and transhistorical perspective. 

An exceptional tool for discovering and understanding cultural diversity in Canada and around the world, past and present, this new wing displays a rich selection from the Museum’s collection, including over 10,000 archaeological objects and works by artists from many different cultures. The Museum’s encyclopedic collection is one of the oldest and most prestigious in Canada. The 1,025 m2 of the Stephan Crétier and Stéphany Maillery wing contain more than 1,500 objects and works by artists who hail from every continent. Located in the Jean-Noël Desmarais Pavilion, the largest and most visited of the Museum’s five pavilions, the wing presents treasures from Africa, Asia, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Oceania and the Americas dating from the 4th millennium B.C.E. to today. It invites visitors to take a fresh, 360-degree look at our early heritage and contemporary creations. The presentation design goes beyond the discourse of art history to highlight the exchanges that have occurred and continue to occur between cultures, while displaying present-day disciplines and social concerns. Situated in the heart of a humanist and socially engaged museum, the wing promotes inclusive values that reflect Montreal, a metropolis made up of close to 120 cultural communities. It invites people of different cultures to come together to better understand one another at a time, in this 21st century, when togetherness has become an issue of vital importance.

Peoples have to pay 5.25% of income from work, capital and winnings from gambling and at 3.95% on social security and pensions. People get 70% of most health care costs, and 100% for costly or long-term problems from it. Most people also have also private health insurance from not-for-profit groups called mutuelles. That pays for about 3.7% of hospital treatment and 21.9% of the cost of spectacles and prostheses, 18.6% of drugs and 35.9% of dental care.

People have a "Carte Vitale", a smart card with information about their health and their insurance. 

General practitioners run their own small business but get their money from the insurance system. There are public hospitals - 62% of hospital beds, non-profit independent hospitals (which are linked to the public system) - 14%, and private for-profit hospitals - 24%.

Are the various rebellions against Ottomans and Turkey in the Dersim region

Various rebellions took place in the region in the 1877, 1885, 1892, 1907, 1911, 1914 and 1916. The last one was published in 1938.

At the time of the establishment of the Safavid Empire, Shi'ism, the official sect of the Safavid Empire, had been able to spread to Dersim in a favourable manner. The Kurds of Dersim showed favour towards Shāh Ismā'īl I and agreed to cede the fortress of Kemah to Ismā'īl as a military base to facilitate the military movements of the Safavids, on condition that their sovereignty and independence would be respected by Ismā'īl. Although the Ottoman presence began to be felt in the region after Mehmed II the Conqueror defeated the Aq Qoyunlu in 1473, its incorporation into the Ottoman lands took place after the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514 during the reign of Selim the Grim. However, the harsh and rugged geographical structure of this place caused it to be in the hands of local administrators from time to time, away from state control. They displayed a rebellious situation during the weak periods of the central administrations. Even in 1895 between 1897, many Armenian "fedayis" took refuge in Dersim and benefited from the "baht" (of asylum) of the Dersimites and were able to protect themselves against the bathtubs of the Turkish sultanate administration.

Both his grandfather and father had been parish clerk at St Peter's in Liverpool. They were also minor composers. His uncle Michael Maybrick (1799–1846) was organist at St Peter's.

Volatile organic compound

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a type of gases that can move through the air easily. They are organic compounds, which means they contain carbon. They have a high vapor pressure, so they become gas at a low temperature. Most scents that we can smell come from molecules of VOCs.

VOCs are often made through burning. For example, burning fossil fuels makes VOCs. They are a common type of air pollution. High levels of VOCs in the air can affect breathing, affect the immune system, and cause allergies. They can also react with other chemicals and make smog.

Social care in the United Kingdom

Social care in the United Kingdom is the job of local government. The Department of Health and Social Care manages the system in England. The Care Quality Commission visits organizations which provide it. 

In the past social care was largely a family affair. Not many people survived to live long with severe health problems. People who were born disabled or with learning difficulty were often put in long stay hospitals for life. People with mental illness often lived in big hospitals for years. These institutions have mostly closed and now more people get help in their own homes or in group homes. They may pay for it, or it may be supplied by the local council. People who pay themselves pay a lot more than what the council pays. More people need social care as more people live to be old and people survive with conditions which in earlier times would have meant an early death. The 1948 National Assistance Act set up old people's homes, run by local government in England, and geriatric wards in hospitals. Conditions in the geriatric wards were often poor. Many were in former workhouses. They were closed and now people end up in nursing homes which are private and they may have to pay. Some are small firms, with a single care home, some are part of huge chains backed by venture capital. HC-One is Britain’s biggest, with about 20,000 staff and 321 homes. About 400,000 people are in residential institutions and about the same number get care in their own homes. 

There have a been a lot of reports about social care. They all recommended major changes in funding and provision but very little has changed since 1990. There have been proposals for a National Care Service like the NHS, but people who have more than £23,250 (or £24,000 in Wales) have to pay, so people are forced to sell their houses. The Health Foundation says that extra money - somewhere between £6.1 and £14.4 billion a year - will be needed to meet future demand in social care by 2030. 

The costs of social care for children fall on local councils. Demand for support for children with special educational needs and disabilities and the cost of it have increased much more than council budgets. Better treatment and diagnosis means more parents want support. If they dont get it they can appeal to an independent tribunal. 96% of appeals are successful. This is one of the main reasons councils are in “financial distress”. Some have declared themselves in effect bankrupt. 

Social care is not just for old people. About a third of people needing it are disabled adults. 

In a year, more than 4.3 million people in the UK become unpaid carers. 4 million people stop their unpaid caring roles every year. The unpaid care work in the UK was recently valued at £59.5 billion a year. The 2021 United Kingdom census found an increase in the number of people who said they were caring for more than 20 hours a week compared to 2011, but fewer people caring for less than that.

Social workers are employed to make decisions about the help people need if the government is paying. The people who are paid to actually do this work may be called care workers. They are mostly women and the pay is low. People often leave for better paid work in retail.  According to Skills for Care there were 165,000 unfilled jobs in England in 2021/22 - 52% more than the year before. There are about 988,000 paid care workers in the United Kingdom. Many of these workers are immigrants. 58,000 came to the UK in the year to March 2023 — mostly from India and Nigeria. The trade union Unison reported in 2023 that many pay a lot of money to people in their home countries who find them work. They are then vulnerable to exploitation and cannot complain. 

Social care is often needed when people have been in hospital. Pressure on hospitals caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has also put pressure on social care. Lack of social care is is a big cause of people getting stuck in hospital.

The Care Quality Commission said in October 2022 that health and social care in England was " gridlocked and unable to operate effectively." Only 2 in 5 people were able to leave hospital when they are ready to do so. They said it needed planning and investment.

According to Skills for Care there were 165,000 unfilled jobs in England in 2021/22 - 52% more than the year before. There are about 988,000 care workers in the United Kingdom.

There were 12,280 registered care homes in England at the end of 2022, but by May 31 there were only 12,224. The numbers of care homes have been falling for some years, as costs, especially for mortgages, have risen. There has been a shift away from care homes to care at home. In 2023 there were 6,600 more home care agencies in England than in 2010.

In November 2022 the Department of Health and Social Care put up an extra £500 million. This was intended to help to lower the number of people stuck in hospitals because they couldnt get social care.

Cryocooler

A cryocooler is a refrigerator that is built to reach cryogenic temperatures. These are temperatures below . These are most often smaller systems. They are normally small enough to sit on a table. Most cryocoolers have input powers less than about 20 kW. Some can have input powers as low as 2–3 W. Most cryocoolers use a cryogenic fluid and moving parts to move the fluid around a thermodynamic cycle. The fluid is normally compressed at room temperature. It is precooled in a heat exchanger. The fluid is then expanded at some low temperature. When the low-pressure fluid returns, it passes through the heat exchanger to precool the high-pressure fluid before entering the compressor intake. The cycle is then repeated.

Large systems are more often called cryogenic refrigerators. These are used for cooling the superconducting magnets in particle accelerators. Their input powers can be as high as 1 MW.

Jongmyo (shrine)

A Jongmyo () or Taimiao () is a temple in China. They are very old temples where people honored their ancestors who were important and powerful. Nobles and rulers are honored in these temples. The word ""Jong"" (宗) means "ancestral" and ""Myo"" means "temple." (庙) The first Jongmyo found was at the Yinxu Palace and Temple Site in Anyang, China. As of 2023, it has not been excavated. In the past, only important people were allowed to have these temples for their ancestors. People who did not have much power were not allowed to make these temples. This is according to a writing called "The Xunzi-Liturgy."

In old China, temples were seen as important symbols of the country. They were often linked to the idea of "land and food". Damaging a temple was seen as a serious crime. For example, in the laws of the Tang dynasty, destroying a temple was act of "treason."

The word "Jongmyo" in Korean or "Zongmiao" in Chinese comes from two characters. These are "宗" (Zong), which means "ancestors", and "庙" (Miao), which means "temple." 

There is another similar word called "Taimiao." In this word, "太" (Tai) replaces "宗" (Zong) and "太" means "highest."

The Yinxu Palace and Temple is an old temple. It was build over 3,300 years ago for the emperor of the Yin dynasty in China. The palace and temple were found in the city of Anyang in Henan Province. Many things from the same time period, like the Simu Xin Ding, have also been found there. In 2006, it was chosen as a World Heritage Site.

The Imperial Ancestral Temple is on the east side of Tiananmen Square in Beijing. It was a temple where the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties honored their ancestors. In 1924, it became a park for peace. In 1950, its name was changed to the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace. Today, it is considered a very important part of China's cultural heritage. The site is protected by the government as a National Key Cultural Relics Protection Unit.

The Temple of the Emperors was a place where the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors were worshipped. The emperors from the Ming and Qing dynasties were also worshipped there. It was first built in Yingtian Prefecture, which is now called Nanjing. It was moved to Shuntian Prefecture, which is now Beijing. The temple is on Fuchengmennei Street in the Xicheng District of Beijing.

The Jongmyo system was brought to Korea from China by the Silla kingdom. The first Jongmyo temple was built in 1394 by King Taejo of Joseon. It is believed to be the oldest royal Confucian temple in the world. In 1995, the temple was added to the World Heritage List by UNESCO. The Jongmyo ritual is a Confucian ceremony that honors the Joseon Dynasty monarchs and princesses. It takes place every year on the first Sunday in May at the Jongmyo temple in Seoul, Korea. The music played during this ceremony is a type of Korean court music. It is called Jongmyo ritual music. The music was recognized as an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO in 2001.

The Ise Grand Shrine and Iwashimizu Hachimangū of Japan are known as the "Nisho no Sōtō". They are important places for worship for the imperial family. The imperial shrine in the Three Palace Sanctuaries of the Tokyo Imperial Palace is where the spirits of the Emperors of Japan are honored.

During the Edo period, the Nikkō Tōshō-gū and other mausoleums of the Tokugawa family were the temples of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The shoguns would regularly go to these temples to pay their respects. There was also a place in Edo Castle where the Shogun's family could honor their ancestors. It was called the Gobudo-no-mikoto in Ōkoku.

During the Ryukyu Second Shō dynasty, the Enkaku-ji Temple was a special temple built to honor the previous king. The Tenno-ji Temple and the Tenkai-ji Temple were dedicated to the memory of past monarchs. The Ryufu-ji Temple was created to honor the spirits of the kings of the First Shō dynasty.

Thế Miếu, also known as Thế Tổ Miếu, is a temple in the Imperial City of Huế, Vietnam. It was built to honor the emperors of Vietnam.


Tian

Tian (Heaven, 天) is a very old idea in Chinese culture. It was important in Chinese stories, ideas and religion a long time ago. During the Shang dynasty (17th to 11th centuries BCE), the Chinese people worshiped a god called Shàngdì, which means "Lord on High". During the Zhou dynasty, the same god was called Tiān. For many centuries, worshiping Heaven was a big part of the official religion in China.

Taoism and Confucianism talk about Tiān (天), which is the part of the universe that is up in the sky, and is often called "Heaven." They also talk about Dì (地), which is the part of the universe that is on the ground and is often called "Earth." These two things are connected and work together.Taoism and Confucianism talk about Tiān and Dì. Tiān is in the sky and is called Heaven. Dì is on the ground and is called Earth. These two parts of the world make up the Three Realms. The middle part is where people live. The lower part is where demons and ghosts are found.

The word "Tiān" means heaven in Chinese. The modern character for "Tiān" is made up of two parts, "dà" which means "big" or "great", and "yī" which means "one". In the past, the character for "Tiān" was made to look like a person with a big head. Some old characters even show the person with their arms stretched out, looking big and important. The ancient characters for "Tiān" also had a round or square head, or a head marked with one or two lines. This might suggest that the original meaning was "a powerful deity", not just the sky.

Tiān (天) is part of many Chinese words. Here are some important ones:



Ise Grand Shrine

The Ise Grand Shrine (伊勢神宮, Ise Jingū) is a religious site in Ise, Japan. It's for the sun goddess Amaterasu. The shrine is made up of many smaller shrines, with two main shrines called Naikū (内宮) and Gekū (外宮). People simply call it Jingū (神宮).

The Naikū Shrine (officially called "Kōtai Jingū") is in Uji-tachi, near Ise. It's where people worship Amaterasu, the sun goddess, who they believe lives there. The buildings are made of wood from a tree called cypress and they don't use nails to put them together. Instead, they use a special way of joining the wood. The Gekū Shrine (officially called "Toyouke Daijingū") is about 6 kilometers from Naikū. It's for Toyouke-Ōmikami, the god of farming, getting food from crops, and work. Besides the Naikū and Gekū shrines, there are 123 more Shinto shrines in and around Ise City. 91 of them are connected to Naikū and 32 are connected to Gekū.

People say the Sacred Mirror "Yata no Kagami" is kept at this shrine. It's one of the most important and holiest places in the Shinto religion.You can only see the central buildings from the outside, because they're behind four tall wooden fences. Visitors can walk around in the forest and see the old walkways from the Meiji period.

A long time ago, about one out of every ten Japanese people would make a special trip to the shrine. This was very popular and happened a lot, both for religious and business reasons. According to old records, in 1625 over 3.62 million people visited the shrine in 50 days. And in 1829, during a big festival that happens every 20 years, 1.18 million people came to the shrine in just three days.People consider the shrine a sacred place, so they don't check for security. It's considered disrespectful to the shrine. There's a path that people take on their pilgrimage between the two main shrines, and it goes through a neighborhood called Furuichi.

The person in charge of the shrine must be from the Japanese royal family. They make sure the shrine is taken care of. Right now, the person in charge is Princess Sayako Kuroda, who is the daughter of Emperor Emeritus Akihito.

Siege of Vienna

The siege of Vienna, in 1529, was the first attempt by the Ottoman Empire to capture the capital city of Vienna, Austria, Holy Roman Empire. Suleiman the Magnificent, sultan of the Ottomans, attacked the city with over 100,000 men, while the defenders, led by Niklas Graf Salm, numbered no more than 21,000. Nevertheless, Vienna was able to survive the siege, which ultimately lasted just over two weeks, from 27 September to 15 October, 1529.

The siege came in the aftermath of the 1526 Battle of Mohács, which had resulted in the death of Louis II, King of Hungary, and the descent of the kingdom into civil war. Following Louis' death, rival factions within Hungary selected two successors: Archduke Ferdinand I of Austria, supported by the House of Habsburg, and John Zápolya. Zápolya would eventually seek aid from, and become a vassal of the Ottoman Empire, after Ferdinand began to take control of western Hungary, including the city of Buda.

The Ottoman attack on Vienna was part of the empire's intervention into the Hungarian conflict, and in the short term sought to secure Zápolya's position. Historians offer conflicting interpretations of the Ottoman's long-term goals, including the motivations behind the choice of Vienna as the campaign's immediate target. Some modern historians suggest that Suleiman's primary objective was to assert Ottoman control over all of Hungary, including the western part (known as Royal Hungary) that was then still under Habsburg control. Some scholars suggest Suleiman intended to use Hungary as a staging ground for further invasion of Europe.

The failure of the Siege of Vienna marked the beginning of 150 years of bitter military tension between the Habsburgs and Ottomans, punctuated by reciprocal attacks, and culminating in a second Siege of Vienna in 1683.

In August 1526, Sultan Suleiman I decisively defeated the forces of King Louis II of Hungary at the Battle of Mohács, paving the way for the Ottomans to gain control of south-eastern Hungary; the childless King Louis died, possibly drowning when he attempted to escape the battlefield. His brother-in-law, Archduke Ferdinand I of Austria, brother of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, claimed the vacant Hungarian throne. Ferdinand won recognition only in western Hungary; a noble called John Zápolya, from a power-base in Transylvania, challenged him for the crown and was recognised as king by Suleiman in return for accepting vassal status within the Ottoman Empire. Thus Hungary became divided into three zones: Royal Hungary, Ottoman Hungary and the Principality of Transylvania, an arrangement which persisted until 1700.

Following the Diet of Pozsony (modern Bratislava) on 26 October, Ferdinand was declared king of Royal Hungary due to the agreement between his and Louis's families, cemented by Ferdinand's marriage to Louis's sister Anna and Louis's marriage to Ferdinand's sister Mary. Ferdinand set out to enforce his claim on Hungary and captured Buda in 1527, only to relinquish his hold on it in 1529 when an Ottoman counter-attack stripped Ferdinand of all his territorial gains.

In the spring of 1529, Suleiman mustered a large army in Ottoman Bulgaria, with the aim of securing control over all of Hungary at his new borders by Ferdinand I and the Holy Roman Empire. Estimates of Suleiman's army vary widely from 120,000 to more than 300,000 men, as mentioned by various chroniclers. As well as numerous units of "Sipahi", the elite mounted force of the Ottoman cavalry, and thousands of janissaries, the Ottoman army incorporated a contingent from Moldavia and renegade Serbian warriors from the army of John Zápolya. Suleiman acted as the commander-in-chief (as well as personally leading his force), and in April he appointed his Grand Vizier (the highest Ottoman minister), a Greek former slave called Ibrahim Pasha, as "Serasker", a commander with powers to give orders in the sultan's name.

Suleiman launched his campaign on 10 May, 1529 and faced numerous obstacles from the onset. The spring rains that are characteristic of south-eastern Europe and the Balkans were particularly heavy that year, causing flooding in Bulgaria and rendering parts of the route used by the army barely passable. Many large-calibre cannons and artillery pieces became hopelessly mired or bogged down, leaving Suleiman no choice but to abandon them, while camels brought from the empire's Eastern provinces, not used to the difficult conditions, were lost in large numbers. Sickness and poor health became common among the janissaries, claiming many lives along the perilous journey.

Suleiman arrived in Osijek on 6 August. On the 18th he reached the Mohács plain, to be greeted by a substantial cavalry force led by John Zápolya (which would later accompany Suleiman to Vienna), who paid him homage and helped him recapture several fortresses lost since the Battle of Mohács to the Austrians, including Buda, which fell on 8 September. The only resistance came at Pozsony, where the Turkish fleet was bombarded as it sailed up the Danube.

As the Ottomans advanced towards Vienna, the city's population organised an ad-hoc resistance formed from local farmers, peasants, and civilians determined to repel the inevitable attack. The defenders were supported by a variety of European mercenaries, namely German Landsknecht pikemen and professional Spanish harquebusiers, sent by Charles V, who was Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain.

Queen Mary of Hungary, who was the sister of Charles V, in addition to 1,000 German Landsknechts under Count Niklas Salm, sent a contingent of 700–800 Spanish harquebusiers. Only 250 Spanish survived.

The Spanish were under the command of Marshal Luis de Ávalos, with captains Juan de Salinas, Jaime García de Guzmán, Jorge Manrique, and Cristóbal de Aranda. This elite infantry excelled in the defense of the northern area and with discretion fire prevented the Ottomans from settling in the Danube meadows, near the ramparts, where they could have breached with enough space to work. These elite soldiers also built additional palisades and trap pits that would be essential during the siege.

The Hofmeister of Austria, Wilhelm von Roggendorf, assumed charge of the defensive garrison, with operational command entrusted to a seventy-year-old German mercenary named Nicholas, Count of Salm, who had distinguished himself at the Battle of Pavia in 1525. Salm arrived in Vienna as head of the mercenary relief force and set about fortifying the three-hundred-year-old walls surrounding St. Stephen's Cathedral, near which he established his headquarters. To ensure the city could withstand a lengthy siege, he blocked the four city gates and reinforced the walls, which in some places were no more than six feet thick, and erected earthen bastions and an inner earthen rampart, levelling buildings where necessary to clear room for defences.

The Ottoman army that arrived in late September had been depleted during the long advance into Austrian territory, leaving Suleiman short of camels and heavy artillery. Many of his troops arrived at Vienna in poor health after the tribulations of the long march through the worst of the wet season. Of those fit to fight, a third were or "Sipahis", ill-suited for siege warfare. Three richly dressed Austrian prisoners were dispatched as emissaries by the Sultan to negotiate the city's surrender; Salm sent three richly dressed Muslims back without a response.

As the Ottoman army settled into position, the Austrian garrison launched sorties to disrupt the digging and mining of tunnels below the city's walls by Ottoman sappers, in one case almost capturing Ibrahim Pasha. The defending forces detected and successfully detonated several mines that had been intended to breach the walls. On 6 October, 8,000 men were dispatched to attack the Ottoman mining operations. They succeeded in destroying many of the tunnels, but they sustained heavy losses when the confined space hindered their return to the city.
More rain fell on 11 October, and with the Ottomans failing to breach the walls, the prospect of victory began to fade. In addition, Suleiman was facing critical shortages of food, water and other supplies, while casualties, sickness, and desertions began to take their toll. The janissaries began voicing their displeasure at the lack of progress, demanding a decision on whether to remain or abandon the siege. The Sultan convened an official council on 12 October to deliberate the matter. It was decided to attempt one final, major assault on Vienna, an "all or nothing" gamble. The assault was launched on 14 October, but despite extra rewards being offered to the troops, it was beaten back, with the defenders' arquebuses and long pikes proving decisive. The following day, with supplies running low and winter approaching, Suleiman called off the siege and ordered a withdrawal to Constantinople.

With unusually heavy snowfall, conditions deteriorated. The Ottoman retreat was hampered by muddy roads along which their horses and camels struggled to pass. Pursuing Austrian horsemen took many stragglers prisoner, although there was no Austrian counter-attack. The Ottomans reached Buda on 26 October, Belgrade on 10 November and their destination, Constantinople, on 16 December.

Some historians speculate that Suleiman's final assault was not necessarily intended to take the city but to cause as much damage as possible and weaken it for a later attack, a tactic he had employed at Buda in 1526. Suleiman would lead another campaign against Vienna in 1532, but it never truly materialised as his force was stalled by the Croatian Captain Nikola Jurišić during the siege of Güns (Kőszeg). Nikola Jurišić with only 700–800 Croatian soldiers managed to delay his force until winter closed in. Charles V, now largely aware of Vienna's vulnerability and weakened state, assembled 80,000 troops to confront the Ottoman force. Instead of going ahead with a second siege attempt, the Ottoman force turned back, laying waste the south-eastern Austrian state of Styria in their retreat. The two Viennese campaigns in essence marked the extreme limit of Ottoman logistical capability to field large armies deep in central Europe at the time.

The 1529 campaign produced mixed results. Buda was brought back under the control of the Ottoman vassal John Zápolya, strengthening the Ottoman position in Hungary. The campaign left behind a trail of collateral damage in neighbouring Habsburg Hungary and Austria that impaired Ferdinand's capacity to mount a sustained counter-attack. However, Suleiman failed to force Ferdinand to engage him in open battle, and was thus unable to enforce his ideological claim to superiority over the Habsburgs. The attack on Vienna led to a rapprochement between Charles V and Pope Clement VII, and contributed to the Pope's coronation of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor on February 24, 1530. The outcome of the campaign was presented as a success by the Ottomans, who used the opportunity to show off their imperial grandeur by staging elaborate ceremonies for the circumcision of princes Mustafa, Mehmed, and Selim.

Ferdinand I erected a funeral monument for the German commander Nicholas, Count of Salm, head of the mercenary relief force dispatched to Vienna, as a token of appreciation of his efforts. Nicholas survived the initial siege attempt, but had been injured during the last Ottoman assault and died on May 4, 1530. The Renaissance sarcophagus is now on display in the baptistery of the Votivkirche cathedral in Vienna. Ferdinand's son, Maximilian II, later built the Castle of Neugebaeude on the spot where Suleiman is said to have pitched his tent during the siege.

Manichaean scripture

The Manichaean religion has nine main books as part of its scripture: seven of them are the Seven Treatises, which were written by Mani himself in the Syriac language, one is the Shabuhragan, written by Mani in Middle Persian, and the last one is the Arzhang, a collection of illustrations created by Mani.

There is also a secondary literature called the Kephalaia, which gives comments and explanations on the scripture, but it is not considered part of the main scripture itself..

The Seven Treatises are seven important books in Manichaeism. They were written by the founder of the religion, Mani, and are considered to be the holy scriptures of Manichaeism.

Mani wanted to make a new religion that would bring everyone together. He thought that other religions were not good enough because they only worked when the person who started the religion was still alive. After that person died, the religion became broken into different parts and people did not follow it the same way. Mani believed that his new religion, Manichaeism, was better because it would be popular in every country and every language. He also thought that it would last forever because it had important books and leaders who would keep it strong.

Paint It Black

"Paint It Black" is a song by the Rolling Stones, an English rock band. Keith Richards and Mick Jagger wrote the song. The song was inspired by Indian music. London Recordings released the song as a single in the United States on 7 May 1966. Decca Records released the single in the United Kingdom on 13 May 1966. Later, "Paint It Black" was the first song on the American version of "Aftermath" (1966). The song is not on the UK version of the album.

The song is based on music that Brian Jones made on the sitar. All five members of the Rolling Stones helped make the song. However, only Jagger and Richards were listed as songwriters. "Paint It Black" is different from many other songs made by the band. It has musical instruments that people do not use a lot in rock music. They are the sitar, organ, and castanets. The song had good and bad reviews from music critics. Some people thought the band was copying the Beatles by making music with the sitar.

"Paint It Black" was very successful. It was number one on the "Billboard" Hot 100 music chart for eleven weeks. It was also number one on music charts in the UK. When the song was released again in 2007, it was on the UK Singles Chart for eleven weeks. It was the band's third number one single in the US. It was the band's sixth number one single in the UK. "Paint It Black" was platinum certified by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).

The song was put in the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2018. "Rolling Stone" magazine ranked the song 213 on a list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Many people who make music have made cover versions of "Paint It Black". It has been on many of the band's compilation albums. The band plays "Paint It Black" at many of their concerts.

In 1965, the Rolling Stones were becoming more popular. They had many songs that were popular around the world. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards wrote most of these songs. Earlier, in 1964, they were one of the most popular bands in the United Kingdom. However, they were less popular in the United States. Other British bands, such as the Beatles, the Who, and the Kinks, were more popular in the US. In 1965, the Rolling Stones made the song "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction". This song was number one on American music charts. The album it was on, "Out of Our Heads", was also number one on the "Billboard" 200. The Rolling Stones made more successful songs, such as "Get Off of My Cloud" (1965) and "19th Nervous Breakdown" (1966). 

Allen Klein, an American businessman, saw that the band was becoming more popular in the US. He managed them in the United States. Andrew Loog Oldham was still the main manager of the band. Klein made Decca Records give the band $1.2 million in royalty payments. This was the first time the band had a lot of money from making music. They spent the money on many things, such as new cars and houses.

Many people compared the Rolling Stones to the Beatles. Both of them were popular British rock bands. Oldham advertised the Rolling Stones as a more intense version of the Beatles. However, the Beatles made more meaningful music. Because of this, they were very influential. Both bands were important parts of the British Invasion. Because of their music, they were part of the counterculture of the 1960s.

The Rolling Stones were changing when "Paint It Black" was made. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were writing more music for the band. Early albums by the Rolling Stones only had a few songs made by Jagger and Richards. However, newer albums such as "Out of Our Heads" had many songs written by them. Jagger and Richards wrote every song on "Aftermath" (1966). Brian Jones, the person that made and led the band for many years, thought he was becoming less important. 

Jones had less control over the band's music because of Jagger and Richards. This was because Jagger and Richards wrote many of the band's most popular songs. Jones was bored of writing songs that had normal rock music. He played different instruments, such as the sitar. He wanted to make the band's music sound more unique. Jones learned how to play the sitar quickly. He had studied music with Harihar Rao, a sitar player, in the past. Rao had worked with Ravi Shankar, a famous Indian sitar player. Many other British bands used the sitar in their music, such as the Yardbirds. In 1965, the Beatles released "Rubber Soul". One of the songs on this album, "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)", had sitar music in it. In October 1965, Jones talked with George Harrison. Harrison was the guitar player for the Beatles. Jones played the sitar more after talking to him. He made basic songs with it. One of these songs became the sitar music in "Paint It Black".

Jagger and Richards wrote most of the song while recording music in December 1965. They also wrote parts of it while they were at concerts in 1966. The band planned to make an album named "Could You Walk on the Water?" The band announced that the album would be released in March. A spokesperson for Decca Records said that they were not going to release an album with that name. They did not want Christians to get mad at the album's name, because it was about Jesus Christ walking on water.

Because of the title, the Rolling Stones delayed the album's release to April 1966. This delay gave them more time to make music for the album. The new title for it was "Aftermath". "Paint It Black" was recorded on 6 and 9 March 1966 in Los Angeles, California. Andrew Loog Oldham produced the song. The band also recorded many of the other songs on "Aftermath" on these days.

"Paint It Black" was first written as a pop song in the minor key. The band did not like this version of the song. At first, they did not want to put it on their next album. During a break, Bill Wyman played the organ. He wanted to make a lower bass sound for the song. Wyman's organ music inspired the pentatonic melody in "Paint It Black".

In 1995, Jagger said "Paint It Black" was a "kind of Turkish song". James E. Perone, a music professor, has said that the rhythm and music from the sitar on the song sound more Middle Eastern than Indian. The end of the song has acoustic guitar music played by Richards. Many music critics have said "Paint It Black" is raga rock or psychedelic rock. Perone said the song was very different from the rest of their music. Most of their other music is blues and rock-and-roll. Other songs on "Aftermath", such as "Stupid Girl" and "Lady Jane", were also different.

The song describes someone who is sad because of their spouse's death. Other people think the song also means different things, such as the Vietnam War or drug use. Robert Christgau, a music critic, has said that "Paint It Black" is an example of the band changing their music. He said that Jagger and Richards were the 2nd-best songwriting partners in rock. He put them behind John Lennon and Paul McCartney.

London Records released "Paint It Black" as a single in the US on 7 May 1966. Decca Records released it on 13 May in the UK. The single was released with the song "Long, Long While" in the UK. This song was not on any of the band's studio albums. When the song was released, its writing was credited to "Jagger-Richard". This is because Oldham told Keith Richards to use the last name "Richard" on music the Rolling Stones made in the 1960s. Later releases of the song have its writing credited to "Jagger-Richards".

In the US, the single was released with the song "Stupid Girl". "Paint It Black" and "Stupid Girl" are on the US version of "Aftermath". "Paint It Black" is not on the UK version of the album. On the US version of the album, "Paint It Black" is the first song. It replaces "Mother's Little Helper". This is the first song on the UK version of the album. "Stupid Girl" is the second song on both versions of "Aftermath". 

The song was first released with the name "Paint It, Black". This name is not correct. Decca Records made a mistake when writing the song's name on the album. The Rolling Stones played "Paint It Black" on the "Ed Sullivan Show" on 11 September 1966.

In the UK, the first album "Paint It Black" was released on was "Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass)". This was a compilation album released in 1966. Many other compilation albums made by the band had "Paint It Black" on them. Many live albums made by the Rolling Stones also have the song.

When music critics first listened to the song, some of them thought it was good, and some thought it was bad. Some thought the band was copying the Beatles by making sitar music. When asked about this, Jones said it was "rubbish". He compared it to the fact that many rock bands use the guitar, but make different types of music.

Jones' sitar music on the song inspired many other people to make psychedelic music. Writers for "Melody Maker" said the song would "send the Stones back to number one", and thought it was good. A writer for another British music magazine said Jagger's singing was "better than ever", but did not like the sitar music. Keith Altham from "New Musical Express" (NME) said it was the band's best single since "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction". A writer for "Billboard" said "Paint It Black" was one of the best songs on "Aftermath", and it was going to be a hit song. Many other music writers have said the song was ahead of its time, and inspired new blues, rock, and punk music.

Almost 400 cover versions of "Paint It Black" have been made. Some music makers that have made cover versions of the song are U2, Vanessa Carlton, War, and Ciara. It has been put on many lists of the best songs ever made, such as ones made by "Rolling Stone", "Pitchfork" and "NME". The song was put in the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2018. It is number 213 on "Rolling Stone"'s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

The song has been used in many movies and video games. "Paint It Black" was in the movie "Full Metal Jacket" (1987). It was also in "Black Adam" (2022). The song played during a fight scene in the movie. The song was used for an advertisement for "" (2015). It has been in Guitar Hero games as well. The song was in "" (2007) and "Guitar Hero Live" (2015). In these games, players can play the song on a toy guitar.

In the UK, "Paint It Black" went to the number one spot on national music charts. It was on the "Record Retailer" music chart for ten weeks. The song was the Rolling Stones' sixth number one song in the UK. The band sold 300,000 copies of the single one week after it was released. In 2007, the song was released again. It went onto the UK Singles Chart for eleven weeks. In Germany, "Paint It Black" went to the number two spot on national music charts. The single was also popular in other countries in Europe, such as Austria, Norway, Ireland and Spain. In 2007, the re-release of the single was number 49 on Germany's national music chart.

Irezumi

Irezumi is the Japanese word for tattoo. In English, it is used to talk about many types of Japanese tattoos. It is also used to talk about ways of tattooing people that came from Japanese people, such as the Ainu and Ryukyuan people.

"Irezumi" is not done with any tattoo machines. It is done with metal needles that are put on wooden sticks with silk. It uses a special type of ink called "Nara" ink. Ainu and Ryukyuan tattoos use ink from indigo plants. Making "irezumi" in this way takes a long time. It is also painful to get "irezumi". Tattoos are made by a small number of people named "horishi". "Horishi" usually have apprentices that work with them.

During the Edo period, criminals were given tattoos. Where these tattoos were put was based on what crime someone did. For example, murderers were tattooed on the head. This made tattoos connected to crime in Japan. In the 19th century, the Japanese government made tattoos illegal.

Son of Heaven

The Son of Heaven was a title given to the Chinese ruler who was considered sacred and had power over everything under the sky. This title started with the Zhou dynasty and was based on the idea that the ruler had a mandate from heaven. Later, the title was used by other monarchs in the same region to support their own rule. The Son of Heaven was seen as the most important ruler who had power over everything. In some places, like China and Japan, the ruler was thought of as a god or a chosen one.



Cornufer paepkei

Cornufer paepkei is a frog. It lives in a rainforest. Scientitsts have seen it in exactly one place: the Fakfak Mountains in Indonesia, between 400 and 860 meters above sea level.

The adult frog is 21.6 to 31.4 mm long from nose to rear end. Its voice sounds like a "low, short creak." There is only a little webbed skin on its feet. The frog is yellow-brown in color with dark brown or black marks. There are two yellow-white lines from its nose to its back legs. The backs of the legs are red-brown in color. Other parts of the legs are almost purple. The belly is almost white.

Feng Shan

Feng Shan, was a special ceremony performed by the emperors of China to honor heaven and earth. They would go to Mount Tai and Mount Liangfu to perform the sacrifices. The Feng sacrifice was done at the top of the mountain to honor heaven, while the Shan sacrifice was done at the foot of the mountain to honor earth. 

Completing the Feng Shan ceremony allowed the emperor to be seen as having the support of heaven. The word "feng" means "to seal", and "shan" means "to clear away". 

This ceremony is very important in religious Confucianism. According to Records of the Grand Historian, the emperor would build an altar at the top of the mountain and proclaim their legitimacy to the god of heaven during the Feng sacrifice. During the Shan sacrifice, they would clear land at the foot of the mountain to show respect to the god of earth.

This ceremony was used as a way for emperors to think about the relationship between heaven and earth. It was usually only performed during times of prosperity, with a good emperor and good omens. Some emperors refused to perform the ceremony, feeling they were unworthy of it. 

Although only the emperor was historically allowed to perform the ceremony, there were times when common people did it without permission. The general Huo Qubing even did it alone.

The Feng Shan ceremony played an important role in politics, much like the Secular Games of the Roman Empire. Both were rare and had religious significance, and were important for changing ideas about power. 

Mount Tai has been a place of worship for many years, and it began in prehistoric times.

According to legends, the Yellow Emperor performed the ceremony before ascending to heaven as an immortal.

Sacrifices at Mount Tai continued through the Zhou dynasty. During the Warring States Period, both Qi and Lu leaders would carry out sacrifices at the mountain. In 219 BC, Qin Shihuang carried out what would be considered the first Feng and Shan sacrifices in celebration of uniting China.

The last recorded traditional Feng Shan was performed in 1790 by the Qianlong Emperor. There are only six verified accounts of performances throughout Chinese history.

Emperors like Wu of Han, Gaozong of Tang, and Zetian all carried out sacrifices. In modern times, a festival is held every year to celebrate the occasion with a modern light show.

2024 Republican Party presidential primaries

The 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries are elections in states that are organized by the Republican Party. They choose the delegates to the 2024 Republican National Convention. They happen between January and June 2024. The national convention chooses the party's nominee for president of the United States in the 2024 presidential election. The elections will take place in all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories.

Former president Donald Trump announced he would run on November 15, 2022. Former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley became the first to follow his entrance on February 14, followed by wealth management executive Vivek Ramaswamy one week later, businessman Perry Johnson on March 2, former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson on April 6, radio host Larry Elder on April 20, U.S. Senator Tim Scott on May 19, Florida governor Ron DeSantis on May 24, former Vice President Mike Pence on June 5, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie on June 6, North Dakota governor Doug Burgum on June 7, Miami mayor Francis Suarez on June 14, and former U.S. Representative Will Hurd on June 22. Four frontrunners quickly emerged: DeSantis, Haley, Ramaswamy, and Trump. The remaining candidates failed to gain traction, leading most to drop out in the second half of 2023. Once the primaries began, the only candidates left in the race were the aforementioned four and Hutchinson.

Trump has been seen as the frontrunner and has had a steady lead in primary polling since 2020. Some Republicans have shown concerns about his nomination due to his loss in 2020, his own role in inciting the January 6 United States Capitol attack, his ongoing criminal investigations, and the results of the 2022 midterms

Trump is the first president to run after leaving office since Herbert Hoover in 1940. If he wins the Republican nomination, he will be the first Republican to be nominated for president three separate times since Richard Nixon (Republican nominee in 1960, 1968, and 1972), and the first person to be the Republican presidential nominee in three consecutive elections. If he wins the general election, he will be the first president to serve non-consecutive terms since Grover Cleveland, who won his second term in 1892. Meanwhile, Pence's candidacy made him the first vice president to run against the president under whom they served since John Nance Garner in 1940.

At the January 15 Iowa caucuses, Trump posted a landslide victory, while DeSantis narrowly beat out Haley for second. Ramaswamy finished a distant fourth, while Hutchinson took sixth, behind businessman Ryan Binkley. Owing to their poor showing, Ramaswamy and Hutchinson quickly dropped out of the race. On February 24, Trump won the 2024 South Carolina Republican presidential primary.

After 53 years of hearing everyone celebrate Christmas even though he hates it, The Grinch decides to dress up as Santa Claus and dress his dog Max as a reindeer and steals every Christmas present from every house on Christmas Eve. He meets a little girl named “Cindy Lou Who, who was no more than two” and lies to her that he’s only taking her family’s Christmas tree to fix it. The next morning The Grinch hears everyone singing about how much they love Christmas even though they don’t have any presents. Then The Grinch realizes Christmas isn’t about presents so he returns all the presents that he stole and the people forgive him and he ends up liking Christmas.

Then Cindy Lou Who invited him over for Christmas and he came but the Mayor who used to be his school bully decided to give the Grinch a razor as a present and ask the woman the Grinch loved to marry him and get a new car for Christmas. Then the Grinch got angry and jealous and destroyed all the Christmas decorations and decided to dress up as Santa Claus and steal Christmas. The Grinch is played by Jim Carrey.

Platymantis

Platymantis is a group of frogs in the family Ceratobatrachidae. In English, they are named wrinkled ground frogs, ground frogs, and forest frogs.

Most of the frogs in "Platymantis" live in the Philippines.

"Platymantis" is a large genus, and scientists disagree about which frogs should be in it.

Right now, scientists say at least 30 living species are in this genus. Brown, et al. (2015) say there may be more, 50-60 species, because scientists have not written papers about all of them yet.
"Platymantis" also has one dead species in it:

Brown et al. (2015) moved many species in "Platymantis" into a new genus, "Cornufer". They kept all the frogs that living in the Philippines in "Platymantis".
Many "Platymantis" species live in only a few places.

Sea monster

A sea monster is a monster that is found dwelling in the sea. People have reported seeing sea monsters. One of the most famous monster sightings is the Loch Ness Monster.

There are also sea monster sightings in apps, such as a mysterious creature in Google Maps found roaming the ocean. Some people think sea monsters exist. Other people say they aren’t real at all. There are also prehistoric creatures that may be called sea monsters. They are not real, so we refer them to as fictional creatures.

Although they are not real, some creatures can look like sea monsters, such as anglerfish (Lophiiformes), giant squid ("Architeuthis dux"), colossal squid ("Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni"), and the blobfish ("Psychrolutes marcidus").

"Main article: Loch Ness Monster"

The Loch Ness Monster, better known as Nessie, is one of the most popular sea monsters. In 1934, a gynaecologist named Robert Kenneth Wilson took four photos of the monster. Only two came out clearly. The first was very popular while the second one wasn't dur to being blurry. However, we mostly agree that it is indeed a hoax. This is called the surgeon's photograph.



Delivery robot

A delivery robot is a robot that is used for delivering goods on the last mile. These robots are independent, most of the time they navigate on their own. In some cases, when the robot gets stuck, a remote operator can help the robot resolve the problem. Delivery robots have been used in different situations, such as delivering food, delivering groceries, delivering packagages. They have also been used in special environments, such as delivering samples or drugs in hospitals, or as a way to offer room service in hotels. 

Because they are autonomus they also interact with people. Many people have classified these encounters as either negative, or positive. The delivery robot manufacturer Starship Technologies has reported that people kick their robots. However, most human interactions are positive, and many people have treated these robots like humans because of their appearance. This has led to encounters where people feel a sense of caring towards the robots, assisting the robots when they are stuck, worrying for the robots on their journeys, or praising or thanking robots for their delivery service.

Room service

In some hotels, guests can order food, and drinks, to be delivered to their room. This is called room service. Sometimes, room service is also offered on cruise ships. Depending on the hotel, the service may be offered at any time of the day, or the hours when the service is offered are limited. Lower-priced hotels, and motels usually do not offer room service. A simpler form of room service is to have a minibar in the room. 

To cover for the extra service cost, food and drinks are usually more expensive than in the hotel's own restaurant.

Kenosis

In Christian belief, "kenosis" means that Jesus emptied himself by giving up his own desires and obeying God's will completely. This is a good example for other Christians to follow. It also means that Jesus, in order to live as a human being, chose to limit the use of his divine powers. Some people disagree with this idea and think it takes away from Jesus' divine power.

Philippians 2 talks about the human side of Jesus. Some people believed he was only human and others believed he was only divine, but the official belief is that he was both. Kenotic Christology says that even though Jesus was divine, he chose to live like a regular human and face all the same problems. He could still do amazing things, but he didn't always use his divine powers to solve his problems. He had to eat, sleep, and face human struggles like temptation and frustration. He said that no one knows when the world will end.5 Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, 6 who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, 7 but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. 8 And being found in human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross. 9 Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name, 10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 11 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

- Philippians 2:5-11 (RSV)

Platymantis montanus

The mountain forest frog ("Platymantis montanus") is a frog. People have seen it on Mount Banahao and Mount Apoy in the Philippines.

Platymantis guentheri

Gunther's wrinkled ground frog ("Platymantis guentheri") is a frog. It lives in rainforests in the Great Mindanao Islands in the Philippines. People have seen it as high as 700 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is about 24 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 27 mm long. The skin has bumps on it. Its head and nose are narrow. It has vomerine teeth in its jaw. It has disks on its toes for climbing. The disks on its front feet are larger than the ones on its back feet. The skin on the frog's back is dark in color with marks. There is a stripe down its side. Its belly is light and can have brown spots.

This frog lives in ferns that grow on tree branches, in tree trunks, and on the ground in the forest. It can live in some places that humans have changed. The female frog leaves eggs in water in plants or leaves. The eggs hatch into small frogs. They are never tadpoles.

This frog is not in danger of dying out but there are fewer of them than their were because human beings change the places where they live. For example, humans cut down forests to get wood for building and to make farms.

Charles Olson

Charles Olson (December 27, 1910 – January 10, 1970) was an American poet.

Olson was born and grew up in Worcester, Massachusetts, where his father worked as a mail carrier. 

He went to college at Wesleyan University, where he got his B. A. degree in 1932. He got his M. A.degree there in 1933. For that degree Olson wrote about Herman Melville. He got a Guggenheim fellowship to help him go on studying Melville. During most of World War II, he worked for the Office of War Information as assistant chief of the Foreign Language Division.

He was the leader of Black Mountain College in North Carolina from 1951 to its close in 1956. While there he got to know and effect other poets such as Robert Creeley, Robert Duncan, and Denise Levertov. He called his kind of poetry "Projective Verse". In this, the poem would be an energy shaped by the natural breath and thought of the speaking poet.

Cornrows

Cornrows (sometimes called canerows) are a hairstyle. They are braids with the hair braided very close to the skin of the head. The braids are made with an underhand, upward motion. This makes a raised row. Cornrows usually have simple, straight lines, like the rows of corn in a cornfield, but they can have patterns instead.

Cornrows can have beads, cuffs, or cowrie shells in them. It can take hours to make a cornrow hairstyle.

Cornrows can stay in for weeks if the person washes their head well. Cornrows are also a protective hairstyle: People with African hair wear them to help their hair grow without breaking. However, if the braids are too tight, kept in for too long, or put in hair that can't keep them, the hair might fall out. This is called traction alopecia.

Over the centuries, people from many parts of the world have put their hair in cornrows. In the 20th and 21st centuries, cornrows are more common in people with African ancestors. This has led to accusations of racism and discrimination and to laws about cornrows and other protective hairstyles.

The oldest known human-made things that look like cornrows or braids are statues: the Venus of Brassempouy and the Venus of Willendorf, which were made 25,000-30,000 years ago. People found them in what is now France and Austria.

There are also pictures of women with cornrows in Stone Age paintings in the Tassili Plateau in the Sahara. These pictures could be as old as 3000 B.C. Ancient Cushitic people of the horn of Africa wore this style of braids as long ago as 2000 B.C. The traditional hairstyle of Roman Vestal Virgins had cornrows.

In Africa, especially the Horn of Africa and West Africa, women put their hair in cornrows. Men wear cornrows too. Ancient Greek sculpture and artwork from the 5th century b.c.e. shows men warriors and heroes wearing cornrows. Artwork and statues from the Middle East and Mediterranean from the 3rd and 4th century b.c.e. also show cornrows were common. Men in 19th century Ethiopia wore cornrows: where warriors and kings such as Tewodros II and Yohannes IV were shown wearing cornrows.

The name also refers to either the corn fields or sugar cane fields in the Caribbean.

Cornrow hairstyles in Africa also cover a wide social terrain: religion, kinship, status, age, racial diversity, and other attributes of identity can all be expressed in hairstyle. Just as important is the act of braiding, which passes on cultural values between generations, expresses bonds between friends, and establishes the role of professional practitioner.

Cornrows became common again in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s and again during the 1990s and 2000s. In the 2000s, some athletes wore cornrows, including NBA basketball players Allen Iverson, Rasheed Wallace, and Latrell Sprewell.

There have been arguments in the United States about cornrows, dreadlocks, and other hairstyles. Some employers and schools say they are not good and made rules against wearing them. Employees and civil rights groups said that this meant the employers had cultural bias, meaning that they were prejudiced against the cultures that cornrows come from, mostly American black culture. There have been lawsuits.

In 2011, the High Court of the United Kingdom, saw a test case. The Court said a school's decision stop students with cornrows from entering the school was wrong. The court ruled said the student wearing cornrows could keep wearing them because it was his cultural tradition. The court said that it was sometimes all right for schools to make rules against hairstyles. For example, they said schools could forbid skinhead gangs' shaved heads.

In the US state of California, the CROWN Act was passed in 2019. It said that discrimination based on hair was against the law. Other states have passed CROWN acts too.



Los Angeles Metro Rail

The Los Angeles Metro Rail is an urban transit system in Los Angeles County, California operated by LACMTA or the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The system has a total of six lines, with four being light rail (A, C, E, K) and two being rapid transit (B and D). The Los Angeles Metro Rail has 101 stations and connects to the Metro Busway (G & J), Metrolink, Amtrak, and other transit services.

The A Line, the oldest line in the system, runs between Azusa and Long Beach. More system expansions are currently under construction such as the D Line Extension to West Los Angeles. 

As of 2023, Metro's light rail system is the second busiest in the United States and its rapid transit system is the ninth busiest. 

The Los Angeles Metro Rail has a total number of 101 stations serving six lines. The lines used to be named by colors, but are now identified by letters since 2020. Metro also uses the same line letter naming system for its Metro Busway services. Below is the list of the rail lines and how many stations each go to:

Los Angeles Metro Rail has 101 stations. The light rail stations are mostly above ground, but some are underground. Rapid transit stations (B and D Lines) are all underground. Each station has ticket vending machines, maps, electronic displays, and artwork reflecting the local culture. The underground stations generally are larger and have two levels. The top level is where you can buy tickets (see Fares section for more information) and the bottom level is where passengers can board trains. All stations have elevators and ramps so people with wheelchairs can enter.

To travel on Metro, passengers need a special card called Transit Access Pass (TAP), which they can get from machines at every Metro Rail and Busway station. There are fare inspectors who check if passengers have the card. If you have a TAP card, you can switch between Metro routes for free within 2 hours of your first ride. 

Starting from July 2023, Metro has made it easier for people to pay for their trips using a TAP card. They have replaced their 1-Day, 7-Day, and 30-Day passes with something called fare capping. This means that passengers will never have to pay more than $5 (for up to 3 rides) in a day or $18 (for up to 11 rides) within seven days. To benefit from fare capping, you need to use the same TAP card every time you ride. Once you reach the 1-day or 7-day fare cap, you can travel for free. Fares for students, seniors, disabled, or low-income people are even cheaper. The graph below shows the different fare types and their prices.
The Los Angeles Metro Rail system has officials from the Sheriff's Department watching around half of its trains and stations. The Los Angeles Police Department and Long Beach Police Department are also responsible for stations within their respective cities. Additionally, security keeps an eye on the system through closed-circuit television cameras.

Before the Los Angeles Metro Rail, the Pacific Electric Railway and Los Angeles Railway served passengers of Los Angeles County from 1901 to 1961. However, in 1927, the two systems started replacing their rail lines with buses because more people in the county were buying cars and using them for transportation. In 1958, the systems were taken over by a government agency known as the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority or MTA. By 1963, all rail lines were completely removed and replaced with bus services. 

However, in the 1970s, people started calling for the return of rail transit because there was too much traffic on the county's freeways and roads. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) began building the initial lines throughout the county. In 1980, Proposition A was passed to fund the construction of transit lines. The Blue Line (now the A Line), the first light rail transit line in Los Angeles constructed since Proposition A, opened on July 14, 1990. It originally ran from Long Beach to Downtown Los Angeles at 7th Street/Metro Center station. From its start, the line was very popular requiring Metro to add more capacity to the line in the early 2000s. 

After that, Los Angeles's first rapid transit lines (B and D) were opened in January 1993. The light rail system continued to expand with the C Line in 1995, the L Line in 2003 (now part of the A and E Lines), the E Line in 2012, and the newest line, the K Line, opened in 2022. 

Reseda, Los Angeles

Reseda is a neighborhood in Los Angeles. It is in the San Fernando Valley region. Earthquakes struck the neighborhood in 1971 and 1994.

During the 1940s, Reseda saw a huge expansion in suburban areas, as well as the loss of farmland. This would cause the population of Reseda to jump to over 16,000 by 1950.

Kenju burai-chō Nukiuchino Ryu

Kenju burai-chō Nukiuchino Ryu (拳銃無頼帖 抜き射ちの竜), also known as Ryuji the Gun Slinger, is a 1960 Japanese crime action film directed by Haruyasu Noguchi and produced by Nikkatsu. It stars Keiichiro Akagi as the lead main character. It was the first installment of the Tale of The Gunman series (拳銃無頼帖シリーズ, "Kenjū burai jō shirīzu").

Ryūji Kenzaki, a gunman who has the nickname "Piercing Dragon" (抜き射ちの竜, "Nuki uchi no ryū"), hates killing and finishes his task by shooting the opponent's shoulder on the dominant hand side to make it impossible to recover, so he is called "The Killer Who Dosent Kill" and was feared by many around him. One night, he receives a request to shoot a gang leader, but he cannot pull out his gun due to withdrawal symptoms from drug addiction and is in a crisis. A killer known as "Colt Silver" (コルトの銀, "Koruto no gin") appears and saves Ryuji. Yang Sanyuan, a Chinese businessman from Hong Kong who hires Gin as a bouncer, takes Ryuji to the hospital for treatment, shoulders the expenses, and takes care of his life, such as giving him home after he is discharged from the hospital. Ryuji, who was going to wash his feet, becomes Yang's bodyguard out of obligation. He reunites with his best friend, former boxer Keikichi, in the room of Fusae, a boutique owner who lives in the same apartment. Keikichi became addicted to drugs and gave up boxing after getting involved in match-fixing because of his drug addiction.

While working in restaurants, boutiques, and nightclubs, Yang made money by smuggling drugs in partnership with the Hotta Gang (堀田組, "Hotta gumi"), who ran a boxing gym. However, since the group is under investigation by the Tokyo police, Yang is about to cut ties with the gang. On the other hand, Hotta Gang crime boss Juzaburo Hotta secretly summons Ryuji and asks him to release information on a big deal that will be carried out without the gang, but he avoids answering on the spot. One night, members of the Hotta Gang attacked the Yang's men just after the deal was broke off. Colt Silver killed the Hotta's Gang members, but on the way back, the police appeared and persistently interrogated Yang's close aide and restaurant owner, Zhāng, who was in charge of the transaction.

Zhang uses gardening sands he has in his pocket to escape the situation. Yang discovers an informant among the crew and orders the traitor to be found and eliminated. He also asks Ryuji and Colt to kill Hotta who had attacked his men when the partnership breaks off. Instead of complying, Ryuji demands that Fusae and Keikichi, tied up with Yang's drugs, be set free. Ryuji, who doesn't want to kill people, persuades Hotta to reconcile with Yang, but Gin reluctantly shoots him dead in the middle of it with his mistress, which leads Ryuji to punch Gin away. Yang sees Midori, the nightclub hostess, as a clue leading to the informant and tries to kidnap her to the office. Ryuji, who happened to be an acquaintance of Midori, lied, saying, "That's my sake. It has nothing to do with me." Before long, Midori's older brother, Ishii, a nightclub trumpet player, appears in front of Ryuji. Ishii was the one who passed the information on Yang Gang to the Hotta group and the Tokyo Police and revealed his identity as an undercover narcotics investigator working for the police on an illegal drug smuggling investigation. Knowing that Ryuji is saddened by Keikichi's drug addiction, Ishii asks Ryuji for help destroying the gang and stopping them from selling drugs to the American mafia who wanted to meet with Yang's crew at Yokohama. On the other hand, Yang decides that Fusae is the informant and tortures her, but Gin, who doesn't like Yang's methods of sadistic torture and cruelty, finds a chance and releases her. Keikichi, who is in the hospital, is also attacked by Yang's minions, but he fights off with punches, and Midori hides him while he is escaping.

Ishii's identity is discovered by the Yang Gang, and he disappears. Yang decides that Ryuji hired Ishii and orders Zhang to eliminate Ryuji. Ryuji, who had killed Zhang, was angry at Yang's tyranny and rushed to the port trade site where Yang himself was participating to defeat him. Gin stands in front of Ryuji before he shoots through Gin's right shoulder. Right after that, Yang shoots Gin out of the shadows, fatally injuring him. Ryuji yells "Idiot" (ハジキ, "Baka") and beats Yang. Before he died, the dying Gin praises Ryuji and said in his final words, saying, "If your fist was Hajiki when you killed Hotta, I would have died. But for you, you are the real pistol user." Ishii appears there along with the entire police and arrests Ryuji along with Yang and the rest of the drug traders. Midori, who followed him, says, "I'll be waiting forever," as she sees him taken away by the authorities.

Health in the United Kingdom

Health in the United Kingdom as measured by life expectancy got better from 1841 until 2018. The number of babies dying has gone down because of better food, clean water and drains and more recently because of improvements in midwifery and hospital care. The number of people living with a disability has been going up. It has become more difficult for people to get medical help, especially for poorer and disadvantaged people. 

In 2023 life expectancy was 81, less than most comparable rich companies. This was blamed on the poor state of the health service, particularly the shortage of clinical staff. Men in Knightsbridge, a very wealthy part of London, lived on average 94.1 years - the highest in the country - nearly 15 years longer than the average man. In South Promenade in Blackpool men lived on average 66.6 years.

The Public Health Act 1875 was very important and it was followed by more public health laws.

The biggest health problems now are to do with obesity. Smoking in the UK has been reduced from 45% in 1974 to 16.9% in 2015.

Mental health is a growing problem and has been made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.

Health in Scotland is in many ways worse than the rest of the country. More people die of drugs than in any other country in Europe. 1,330 people died from drug misuse in Scotland in 2021.

Critical theory

Critical theory is an idea created by the Frankfurt School in 1937 which says that almost all of the institutions of society are based on hierarchy and wants to show how those hierarchies are built into society and created so that the powerful can become more powerful while everyone else suffers. The Frankfurt School thought that those hierarchies were based on capitalism and that people should be fighting against capitalism by fighting against the culture it created because those hierarchies were against justice.

Frankfurt School

The Frankfurt School was a group created at the Institute for Social Research at Goethe University Frankfurt in 1929. The Frankfurt School was opposed to capitalism but didn’t support the form of Communism that Vladimir Lenin created in the Soviet Union. 

The Frankfurt School thought that Karl Marx got a lot right but also some things wrong so they decided to fix classical Marxism by mixing Marx’s ideas with the ideas of Sigmund Freud and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. The Frankfurt School thought that, instead of using violence, the best way to fight capitalism was to explain how the culture it created made things worse for a lot of people. So Frankfurt School intellectuals like Jürgen Habermas, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Herbert Marcuse and Erich Fromm created Critical theory to do that.

The people who started the Frankfurt School ran away from Germany to escape Adolf Hitler after he took over and instead came to Columbia University. The far-right has a lot of conspiracy theories about the Frankfurt School.

Herbert Marcuse

Herbert Marcuse was a German American philosopher who supported Western Marxism. Marcuse worked for the CIA in the 1940s and 50s. Marcuse was a part of the Frankfurt School and supported Critical theory. In the 1960s and 70s, his ideas were popular with the New Left.

Banach space

A Banach space is a type of vector space, which is a space made up of vectors. In a Banach space, the length and distance between vectors can be calculated. It is also complete, meaning that a Cauchy sequence of vectors will always reach a limit. The concept was created and studied by Polish mathematician Stefan Banach in 1920-1922. The term "Banach space" was first used by Maurice René Fréchet, and Banach coined the term "Fréchet space". Banach spaces come from the study of function spaces by Hilbert, Fréchet, and Riesz earlier in the century, and play an important role in functional analysis.

Kuroda Kiyotaka

Kuroda Kiyotaka (9 November 1840 – 23 August 1900), also known as Kuroda Ryōsuke was a Japanese statesman and leader, who is the 2nd Prime Minister of Japan from 1888 to 1889 and President of the Privy Council from 1894 to 1900.

Ricci flow

The Ricci flow ( , ) is a partial differential equation used in differential geometry and geometric analysis. It is like the heat equation, which is used to study diffusion of heat. The Ricci flow is named for the Ricci tensor, which is part of its definition. 

Richard Hamilton used the Ricci flow in the 1980s to prove new results in Riemannian geometry. Later, other mathematicians used it to solve the differentiable sphere conjecture. In the 1990s, Hamilton used the Ricci flow to study William Thurston's geometrization conjecture. In 2002 and 2003, Grigori Perelman made new discoveries about the Ricci flow. These discoveries, along with Hamilton's work, are now seen as a proof of the Thurston conjecture, and of the Poincaré conjecture, which had been an open problem since 1904. This work is a major milestone in the fields of geometry and topology. 

Heat equation

The heat equation is a type of equation used in mathematics and physics to describe how heat spreads out in a particular area. The equation was first created by Joseph Fourier in 1822. People use the heat equation to model how heat spreads through different materials.

The heat equation is very important in the field of mathematics, and it is studied a lot. This equation is used in many areas of science and applied mathematics, such as probability theory and image analysis. Some solutions to the heat equation are called heat kernels, and they can provide important information about the area where the heat is spreading.

Scientists have found many different ways to use the heat equation. For example, it can be used to study random walks and Brownian motion in probability theory, and it can help to resolve pixelation in image analysis. In addition, variants of the heat equation are used in financial mathematics and quantum mechanics. Scientists have also found that solutions of the heat equation are helpful in understanding hydrodynamical shocks. People have been studying the heat equation for a long time, and it is a very important topic in mathematics and physics.

Health in India

Health in India has improved a lot in the last 50 years.

In 1975 life expectancy was 49.7 years In 2020 it was above 70. By 2018 about 95.76% of Indian households had toilets. Safe drinking water is not available everywhere, but this has improved a lot.

Family planning has been supported by the Indian government since the 1960s. Vasectomy is encouraged.

Ischemic heart disease is the most common cause of death, followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , stroke and diabetes. Indian people are more likely to get heart disease because of their genes. Lung disease is linked to air pollution. The 10 most polluted cities in the world are all in northern India. More than 140 million Indians breath air 10 times or more over the WHO safe limit.

Malnutrition is still a big problem. More than one third of the world's malnourished children live in India. This is because of economic inequality. The Global Hunger Index for 2021 put India in the 101st position out of 116 countries. More than 40% of children under the age of 5 in some states are stunted due to malnutrition.

Infectious diseases like dengue fever, hepatitis, tuberculosis, malaria and pneumonia are still common. Curing them has become more difficult with the increase of antibiotic resistance.

155,622 people died in road accidents in India in 2021.

AMP-activated protein kinase

5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an enzyme (EC 2.7.11.31) that helps keep the body's energy balanced. It is found in many parts of the body, such as the liver, brain, and skeletal muscle. When AMP and ADP bind to it, AMPK helps the body use glucose and fatty acids for energy. It also helps stop the body from making too much cholesterol, lipogenesis, and triglycerides. AMPK is found in many different kinds of living things, from yeast to humans. It should not be confused with cyclic AMP-activated protein kinase (protein kinase A).

Gerard Manley Hopkins

Gerard Manley Hopkins SJ (28 July 1844 – 8 June 1889) was an English poet and Jesuit priest. After his death, his poetry made him very famous.

Hopkins was born in Stratford, Essex near London, England. His family were Anglicans. 

When he was young, Hopkins liked being in the natural world. He liked music and drawing. When he was ten years old, he was sent to board at Highgate School where he studied from 1854 to 1863. Then he studied classics at Balliol College, Oxford from 1863 to 1867.

At Oxford he became friends with Robert Bridges. Bridges later became the Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom. Hopkins loved the poetry of Christina Rossetti. She became one of his great influences. They met in 1864.

Hopkins had strong religious feelings. In July 1886, he decided to become a Roman Catholic. That September he met the leader of the Oxford converts, John Henry Newman. Newman received him into the Roman Catholic Church on 21 October 1866.

In 1868 Hopkins decided to join a Catholic religious group. He thought poetry got in the way of religion. He burned his poetry. He stopped writing it for seven years. He also wanted to become a Jesuit priest. He joined the Jesuits and made his first vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience on 8 September 1870.

During his studies, his religious superior asked him to write a poem about the sinking of a German ship in a storm. So in 1875 he started to write poetry again. He wrote a long poem called "The Wreck of the Deutschland". It was about a disaster in which five Franciscan nuns died among many who were on the ship. They were leaving Germany because of strong laws against Catholics. 

In 1877 he wrote "God's Grandeur" and other sonnets. He finished a famous poem, "The Windhover," only a few months before his ordination in 1877. 

In October 1877, a month after his ordination, Hopkins became a minister and teacher at Mount St Mary's College near Sheffield. In 1878 he became an assistant priest at a Jesuit church in London. This was followed by work in Oxford, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow. 

In 1884 he became a professor of Greek and Latin at University College Dublin.

After several years of ill health, Hopkins died of typhoid fever in 1889 at the age of 44.

After Hopkins' death, his friend Robert Bridges worked to make his poetry better known. The poems used language in strong and unusual ways. Hopkins became known as one of the most important poets of the Victorian period.

Russian Blue

The Russian Blue() is a cat breed that is short-haired and has a silver-gray coat. Originating in Russia, they are quiet and gentle, rarely crying, and when they do, it's very quiet.

It is believed to have originated from Archangel Isles in northern Russia, although this is not certain. Originally known as Archangel Blue or Foreign Blue, it is said to have been brought to England and Northern Europe by sailors in the 1860s. It was descended from an imperial cat of the Russian royal family and was said to have been a favorite of Queen Victoria, which is why it was introduced as the Archangel cat at the Crystal Palace in England in 1875. At the time of the Russian Blue's introduction, the prevalent cat in Europe was the chartreux, and because of their similar appearance, the Russian Blue was trained to behave like a Siamese and bred to conform to the British's appearance. This led to a gradual loss of distinctive characteristics, and later British breeders who wanted to keep the original Archangel cat alive tried to restore the Russian Blue's appearance. It was recognized as its own breed in 1912, and since then, British, American, and Scandinavian breeders have developed the pedigree and it began to gain popularity in the 1960s.

The Russian Blue cat was descended from the Russian royal family, the Czars. Unlike other cats, the Russian Blue had a reputation for being a wise cat who listened to his master and never got into trouble. One of the only cats to receive an imperial education, Russian Blue was taught manners, such as how to walk and how fast to eat, as well as how to properly follow his master's commands and read his moods. As a result, the Russian Blue remains popular today for its intelligence and wisdom.

Its most distinctive physical feature is the short, silvery-blue fur that densely covers its strong, sleek body. The silky fur tapers to a silvery color toward the tip. It is not patterned. Its head is V-shaped with a flat forehead and a long, slender neck. Its dark green eyes are round and it is known for changing its eye color twice. The dark blue-gray color of their eyes when they are first born changes to yellow at around 2 months of age, and then to green again around 5-6 months of age. However, most Russian Blues are crossed with British Shorthairs, so the green eyes are less common. The ears are large and pointed with a wide base. The tail is tapered towards the tip. They're very quiet and docile, but when their hunting instincts kick in, they'll bite anything they catch. They also have a low-pitched voice and rarely cry. They are affectionate and sensitive to their owner's emotions. They are affectionate with their owners and family members, but are wary of strangers and keep a low profile.

Dionys Schönecker

Dionys Schönecker (29 April 1888 - 14 September 1938) was an Austrian football player, coach and official at SK Rapid Vienna.
His football career (1906–1910) was short and moderately successful. At that time there was no regular championship. He took over Rapid in 1910 and held this position until his death. Till 1925 he was also coach. The club was in a poor financial situation. The club had lost its ground and had become homeless as a result. The majority of the fighting team left the club. So Schönecker decided to continue playing with the youth team as a new first team. This youth team was champion in the first regular football season in 1911/12. In 1912 the club also received a new home ground. The Pfarrwiese was planned by Schönecker's brother and former national player Eduard Schönecker.

His management style was often described as authoritarian and when there were disciplinary problems with a player, the offending player was often quickly thrown out. A famous example is Josef Bican. During Schönecker's 28-years as head of the club from 1910 to 1938, Rapid became 12 times champion, 3 times cup winner and 1 time Mitropacup winner.

He died of appendicitis in 1938 at the age of 50. To honour him in 1985 the Schöneckergasse in Vienna-Penzing (14th district) was named after him.

Six's thermometer

Six's Maximum and Minimum thermometer is a thermometer that can show the maximum and minimum temperatures of a time period. British scientist James Six invented it in 1780. The same basic design is still in use.
It is made of a U-shaped glass tube with two separate temperature scales. There is a scale on each arm of the U. One is for recording the maximum temperature and the other for the minimum temperature. The arms of the U-shaped tube end in sealed glass bulbs. The bulb at the top of the minimum reading scale arm is full of alcohol, the other tube contains a vacuum (or low pressure alcohol vapour).
In the bend of the U is a bit of mercury, a metal that is liquid at room temperature. This is pushed around by the thermal expansion and contraction of the alcohol in the first bulb as it responds to the outside temperature. The vacuum in the other bulb allows free movement of the alcohol and mercury. It is the metal indices that measures the temperature; the mercury shows the temperature reading on both scales. This is unlike a normal mercury thermometer, in which the expansion and contraction of mercury itself indicate temperature.

The maximum and minimum readings are recorded by two small steel markers which are sprung into the capillary tube so that they can slide, but only if a force is applied to them, either by being pushed by the mercury or under the influence of an external magnet.

Before a new maximum or minimum reading can be taken, the thermometer must be reset by moving the markers to the top of the mercury. This is usually done by hand with a small magnet to slide them along the tube. Any change in temperature after that will push one of the markers along with it. 

If the temperature rises, the maximum scale marker will be pushed. If it falls, the moving mercury will push the minimum scale marker. As the temperature varies, the markers will remain in their positions unless the temperature becomes higher (for maximum) or lower (for minimum) than already recorded, in which case the relevant marker is pushed further. For this reason, the markers record the furthest point reached by the mercury in each arm of the tube. This corresponds to the highest and lowest temperatures since the last reset. Typically the thermometer is reset every day to measure temperature changes.

HaSharon Railway

The HaSharon Railway is a railway line in Israel that runs from Tel Aviv to Haifa, with stops in several cities and towns in the Sharon region of central Israel. The line is operated by the Israel Railways company, and is one of the busiest railway lines in the country.

The history of the HaSharon Railway dates back to the early 20th century, when the Ottoman Empire built a railway line between Jaffa and Jerusalem. The line was later extended to Haifa, and became an important transportation link in the region. However, the line was largely destroyed during World War I, and was only partially rebuilt by the British during their mandate over Palestine.

In the years following Israel's independence in 1948, the government began to invest in the country's transportation infrastructure, and decided to rebuild the railway line between Tel Aviv and Haifa. The line was completed in the 1950s, and has since undergone several renovations and upgrades to accommodate growing demand.

Today, the HaSharon Railway runs on a double-track electrified line, with a top speed of 160 km/h. The line connects several major cities in the Sharon region, including Netanya, Hadera, and Binyamina, and provides a fast and efficient transportation option for commuters and travelers.

In recent years, there have been plans to expand the HaSharon Railway even further, with proposals to extend the line to additional cities in northern and central Israel, as well as plans to connect the line to the proposed Tel Aviv Light Rail system. These expansion plans are aimed at reducing traffic congestion on Israel's roads, and improving transportation accessibility for residents and visitors alike.

Modern Hebrew

Modern Hebrew () is the standard form of the Hebrew language spoken today. It is the official language of Israel, where it is used in government, education, and daily life.

The roots of Modern Hebrew can be traced back to ancient Hebrew, which was used in the Bible and other religious texts. However, after the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE, Hebrew ceased to be a spoken language and was only used for religious purposes.

In the late 19th century, a group of Jewish scholars and writers began working to revive Hebrew as a spoken language. They developed new words and grammatical structures to adapt the language for modern use.

Modern Hebrew is spoken today by about 9 millions of people (counting native, fluent and non-fluent speakers), mostly in Israel. 

Modern Hebrew revival refers to the effort to revive Hebrew as a spoken language. Hebrew was originally a language spoken in ancient times, was not a spoken language later, and was only used for religious purposes.

In the late 19th century, a group of Jewish scholars and writers began working to revive Hebrew as a spoken language, in what is known as the Hebrew Language Revival. They developed new words and grammatical structures to adapt the language for modern use. This effort was part of the broader Zionist movement, which aimed to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine.

Through the efforts of these scholars and writers, Hebrew was once again established as a living language, and it is now the official language of Israel. Modern Hebrew has evolved to include modern terminology for fields such as science, technology, and politics, while still retaining its rich literary and religious traditions.

Modern Hebrew is classified as an Afroasiatic language of the Semitic family, the Canaanite branch of the North-West semitic subgroup.
Modern Hebrew has loanwords from many languages, including Arabic (Levantine dialect and from the Jewish Arab dialects), Aramaic, Yiddish, Judaeo-Spanish (Ladino), German, Polish, Russian and English.

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium. It is a relatively new field of study that seeks to understand the behavior of complex systems, such as living organisms, fluids, and gases, which are constantly changing and evolving over time.

In traditional thermodynamics, the focus is on systems that are in thermal equilibrium, meaning that they are at a uniform temperature throughout and there is no net heat flow. However, many real-world systems are not in thermal equilibrium, and this is where non-equilibrium thermodynamics comes into play.

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is concerned with the flow of energy and matter through systems that are not in thermal equilibrium. It aims to understand how these systems behave and how they can be manipulated to achieve specific outcomes. Some of the key concepts in non-equilibrium thermodynamics include entropy production, irreversible processes, and dissipative structures.

Entropy production is a measure of the rate at which disorder increases in a system. In a system that is not in thermal equilibrium, entropy production is always positive, meaning that the system is becoming more disordered over time. Irreversible processes are processes that cannot be reversed, meaning that they lead to a permanent change in the system. Dissipative structures are complex systems that are able to maintain their organization and structure, despite the constant flow of energy and matter through them.

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics has many practical applications, particularly in the fields of biology, chemistry, and engineering. For example, it is used to study the behavior of living organisms, such as the way in which cells maintain their structure and function, and the way in which biological systems evolve over time. It is also used to understand the behavior of materials and fluids under different conditions, such as in the development of new materials and the design of more efficient energy systems.

In summary, non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a fascinating field of study that seeks to understand the behavior of complex systems that are not in thermal equilibrium. It has many practical applications in a variety of fields, and it continues to be an area of active research and development. As we continue to explore the complex behavior of non-equilibrium systems, we are sure to discover many new and exciting phenomena that will help us to better understand the world around us.

Bechet was born in 1897 in New Orleans. His brother gave him a clarinet. He played it very well by the time he was 6 years old. By age 15 he had played in many bands. He moved to Chicago when he was 17. He played with King Oliver's band and others.

In 1919 he moved to New York and joined a band that went to Europe. They played at London’s Royal Philharmonic Hall for five months. In London he started playing a soprano saxophone much of the time. Bechet worked in London until 1922 when he was arrested for assault, jailed, and sent back to the U. S.

His first recordings came out in 1923. He played solos on “Wild Cat Blues” and “Kansas City Man Blues.” This made him "the first important jazz soloist on records in history (beating Louis Armstrong by a few months)."

In 1925, he played in France with La Revue Nègre, the show that made dancer Josephine Baker famous. More trouble around a shooting put Bechet in a Paris jail during 1928 and 1929. He had to leave France.

Back in New York from 1930, Bechet worked sometimes in Noble Sissle’s show band for most of the decade.

In 1940-41, he made famous recordings of “Old Man Blues,” “Nobody Knows The Way I Feel This Morning,” “Egyptian Fantasy,” and “I Know That You Know.”

He went back to Paris in 1949 to play at the Salle Pleyel Jazz Festival. He was so popular that he decided to stay in France. In 1958 he played at the Brussels World’s Fair. Soon after that, he got lung cancer. He died on his birthday in 1959. 


Vector control

Vector control serves as an important cross-cutting activity that aims to enhance the impact of other strategic interventions, with specific focus on prevention of selected neglected tropical diseases whose transmission cycle relies on vectors or intermediate hosts.

Vector control is any method to limit or eradicate the mammals, birds, insects or other arthropods which transmit disease pathogens. The most frequent type of vector control is mosquito control using a variety of strategies. Several of the "neglected tropical diseases" are spread by such vectors.

Insecticides, larvicides, rodenticides, Lethal ovitraps and repellents can be used to control vectors. For example, larvicides can be used in mosquito breeding zones; insecticides can be applied to house walls or bed nets, and use of personal repellents can reduce incidence of insect bites and thus infection.

Vector control is a highly effective way to reduce malaria transmission and is a vital component of malaria control and elimination strategies. WHO currently recommends deployment of either insecticide-treated nets or indoor residual spraying for malaria vector control in most areas at risk of malaria.

Vector control is crucial to reduce the incidence of infection from diseases; this is especially important for those for which there is currently no effective cure or preventive medical measures available, such as Dengue, West Nile virus and Chikungunya virus.

Vectors, as defined by the California Department of Public Health, are “any insect or other arthropod, rodent or other animal of public health significance capable of harboring or transmitting the causative agents of human disease, or capable of causing human discomfort and injury."

List of divided U.S. Routes

This is a list of current divided U.S. Routes. Some routes are given letters to show a split of the main route. For example, U.S. Route 25 (US 25) splits into US 25E (east) and US 25W (west) between Newport, Tennessee and North Corbin, Kentucky. These splits were in the U.S. Highway system from the beginning. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) no longer signs these letters. Current divided routes can be removed as agreements are reached. This was adopted in 1996. Many of these routes still exist, mostly in Tennessee.

Orpington

Orpington is a town located in the London Borough of Bromley, in the southeast of Greater London, England. It is situated about 16 miles southeast of central London and has a population of approximately 16,000 people.

The town has a rich history dating back to the Roman times, with evidence of a Roman villa found in the area. During the medieval period, the town was known for its wool and became an important centre for weaving.

In the 19th century, the arrival of the railway transformed Orpington from a small village into a thriving commuter town. The town grew rapidly in the 20th century and became a popular residential area for people working in London.

Today, Orpington is a bustling town with a range of amenities and attractions, including the Walnuts Shopping Centre, the Priory Gardens, and the Orpington Hospital. The town is also home to several schools and has good transport links to London and the surrounding areas, making it a popular choice for commuters.

Model-based design

Model-based design (MBD) is a way to create systems by using 'behavioral' and 'implementation' computer models, to simulate how they should work before being built in the real world. It is used in many industries, including aerospace, automotive, and medical sectors. These models can be used for fast testing of ideas, and can verify the success and performance of a system faster and more efficiently than simply creating various physical products first.

In model-based design, engineers start by creating a computer model that represents a product, often referred to as a "digital twin". This is a behavioral representation of the product, which helps engineers understand how the product should behave in different scenarios, in order to verify that it meets its requirements. This allows designers to simulate and test systems before they are actually built, allowing for a more efficient and effective design process.

Once the engineers are happy with the behavior of the digital twin, they create a more specific implementation model. Implementation models provide a more detailed representation of a system's structure and functionality, often using specific languages or tools to describe the system's components and their interactions. Implementation models can even be used to automatically generate code, which helps save time and reduces the possibility of errors.

Model-based design is often used in embedded systems, such as equipment and medical devices. For example, engineers might create a digital twin of a pacemaker, and use this to simulate how it will behave in different scenarios. This can help ensure that the pacemaker will function correctly before being placed into a patient. Automotive companies also use model-based design when creating vehicles. For example, a digital twin of an engine may be created to simulate how it will perform in different driving conditions. This can help engineers optimize the design of the engine before building it in the real world.

Vivek Ramaswamy 2024 presidential campaign

The presidential campaign of Vivek Ramaswamy for the 2024 United States presidential election began on February 21, 2023. By early February, it was reported that Ramaswamy, a first generation Indian American, was preparing a presidential campaign. A wealthy biotech entrepreneur, Ramaswamy officially announced his campaign on February 21, 2023.

Ramaswamy is an outspoken critic of “woke-ism”, which he considers victimhood belief-system that negatively impacts the key American values of faith, patriotism, and work-ethics. Ramaswamy has also criticized the corporate environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) initiatives, alleging that these ESG activities mix business with politics and disadvantage the shareholders. The New York Times has described Ramaswamy as an anti-woke candidate, and "The Hill" characterizes him as a conservative.

His campaign admitted in May 2023 that he had paid an editor to edit his English Wikipedia page before announcing his candidacy, but denied that it was politically motivated.

Following the 2024 Iowa caucus on January 15, 2024, Ramaswamy ended his campaign, and formally endorsed Donald Trump.

2023 visit by Joe Biden to Ukraine

On February 20, 2023, the President of the United States, Joe Biden, visited Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. It was his first visit since the 2022 Russian invasion started. Mostly because of security concerns, he did not tell the public before his arrival. Only two journalists went with him.

This was the first time in modern history that a current U.S. President has traveled to an active war zone not controlled by the American military. It was the closest a president had come to a combat zone since Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War.

The Pentagon and the Secret Service did not want Biden to visit Kyiv. Some people thought he might meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy near the Polish border or in Lviv, Western Ukraine. The visit came when US poll numbers began to drop about supporting Ukraine in the war.

During his visit, Biden announced more military aid for Ukraine, worth US$500 million and including ammunition for a rocket launcher system.

Reactions to the visit were mixed, with some Republicans criticizing it and many Democrats supporting it. Many Russian politicians and military experts, such as former President Dmitry Medvedev, criticized Biden. Polish President Andrzej Duda said the trip was important for the Ukrainian soldiers.

The 11 players brought up at La Masia included Víctor Valdés, Martin Montoya, Gerard Piqué, Carles Puyol, Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets, Xavi, Cesc Fàbregas, Pedro Rodríguez, Lionel Messi and Cristian Tello .

The match was a milestone in FC Barcelona's history as it was the first time a team fielded at the same time eleven players nurtured in the club's talent development facility in an official match. La Masia has been a fundamental part of FC Barcelona's football culture and has produced many world-class players, such as Lionel Messi, Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Sergio Busquets.

The 11 from La Masia are an example of FC Barcelona's commitment to developing young talent and their unique style of play based on ball control and possession. The match has been remembered as a historic event in the club's long tradition and as a tribute to the players who have been brought up at La Masia.

FC Barcelona is a football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, founded in 1899. The club is known for its successful history and its characteristic style of play based on ball control and short passing. One of the club's success factors is its La Masia youth academy, which has produced many of the world's best players.

On November 25, 2012, FC Barcelona moved to Valence to face Levante UD in a league match in La Liga. This was an important match for the club, which had already established itself as one of the top clubs in the world. Ahead of the match, FC Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova decided to use a unique tactic by fielding eleven players who had trained and developed at the club's La Masia youth academy.

This was the first time in FC Barcelona's history that the club used such tactics in an official match. The starting XI consisted of goalkeeper Víctor Valdés, defenders Martin Montoya, Gerard Piqué, Carles Puyol and Jordi Alba, midfielders Sergio Busquets, Xavi and Cesc Fàbregas, and forwards Pedro Rodríguez, Lionel Messi and Cristian Tello.

The match, which was also called "Los 11 de La Masia", became a historic event for FC Barcelona and its youth academy. This is proof of the club's successful work in developing and promoting young talent. The club's ability to cultivate youth academy talent is vital to its success and to maintaining its identity as a club that plays a beautiful and attractive game of football.

FC Barcelona made history on 25 November 2012 by fielding, for the first time in the club's history, a complete starting XI of players trained at their academy, La Masia, in an official match. The match was played at Camp Nou against Levante UD in the tenth round of the Spanish league.

The team was led by coach Tito Vilanova and consisted of Víctor Valdés in goal, defenders Martin Montoya, Gerard Piqué, Carles Puyol and Jordi Alba. The midfield consisted of Sergio Busquets, Xavi and Cesc Fàbregas while the attacking trio consisted of Pedro Rodríguez, Lionel Messi and Cristian Tello.

From the first minute, Barça dominated the match with their characteristic possession and constant movement, and Levante UD had few chances to create danger in Valdé's goal. Although Barça struggled to break through the opposition's defense in the opening minutes, Messi had a good opportunity in the 17th minute after a pass from Pedro, but his shot was blocked by the Levante goalkeeper.

Finally, Barça managed to open the scoring in the 26th minute through a goal by Cesc Fàbregas, who capitalized on a pass from Messi to slot the ball into the goal from inside the penalty area. After that, Barça started to dominate the game and Messi increased the lead in the 43rd minute after a pass from Xavi.

In the second half, Barça kept control of the match and extended their lead in the goals tally through two more goals by Cristian Tello in the 55th and 58th minutes. Levante UD tried to close the gap, but Barça maintained possession and control of the game until the end, resulting in a historic 4-0 win.

After the match between The 11 from La Masia and Levante UD on 25 November 2012, the press praised the performance of FC Barcelona and especially their youth academy, La Masia. This was the first time in the club's history that an entire starting eleven consisted of own products, which was a big step forward for the club's philosophy and youth activities. 

Sports journalists particularly praised Lionel Messi's performance on the pitch, where he showed his class and skill by creating several scoring chances and scoring a goal himself. Midfielder Cesc Fàbregas was also praised for his goal and his contributing role in the game.

Several football experts also commented on how important it is for clubs to have a strong youth operation, stressing that Barcelona's success was not only due to individual performances, but to the club's long-term philosophy.

Both coach Tito Vilanova and the players were humbled by the victory and stressed the importance of continuing to work hard and improve the team. This was an important victory for FC Barcelona and proof that their youth operation was one of the best in the world.

After the match, fans showed their support and love for the club through social media and other platforms. This was an important day in Barcelona's history and a testament to their strength as a club and as a team.

The match The 11 from La Masia was one of the most significant matches in the history of FC Barcelona. Not only did the club present a starting eleven made up of players developed in the club's youth academy, but also showed that these players were fully capable of playing at the highest level of professional football. 

The match marked the beginning of an era where La Masia-produced players became the core of Barcelona's dominance of Spanish and European football. In the following years, players such as Sergi Roberto, Marc Bartra and Rafinha Alcántara became important members of the first team.

By successfully integrating the youth academy with the first team, FC Barcelona has created a model for club development that has inspired other football clubs around the world. The 11 from La Masia will always be a reminder of Barcelona's pride in its academic tradition and the club's ability to produce some of the best footballers in the world. 

In 2022, FC Barcelona held a tribute event to celebrate the 10th anniversary of The 11 from La Masia. During the event, highlights from the match were shown and former players and coaches were interviewed about their memories of the historic event. Players who took part in the match were also invited to celebrate the anniversary and meet the fans.

As well as paying tribute to the match and the players who took part in it, the club also used the occasion to emphasize the importance of their youth academy and their commitment to training young talent.

Influence of William Shakespeare on the English language

William Shakespeare, considered the greatest English writer of all times, was born in 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon, and was the third of eight children. He went to a good grammar school and studied Latin and Classics. That influenced him as well as his latter works. Thanks to his education, Shakespeare learnt certain tools to work with and develop his talent. He married Anne Hathaway at the age of 18 and had three children. 

He died on the 23rd of April of 1616, and he is considered to belong to the Elizabethan Era - the period in English history under the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, during the Tudor Period (1485-1603). 

This period of time is considered to be the golden age in English History due to the prosperity England underwent as well as the development of the arts. It is characterized by political, religious and social peace and marked by the flourishing of the Renaissance and, therefore, literature and intellectual progress. It is an era of patriotism and nationalism, as well as religious tolerance. In words of W. H. Hudson: "Such were some of the conditions which combined to create the spirit of Shakespeare’s age – An age in which men lived intensely, thought intensely and wrote intensely.”

He wrote his first plays around 1592 and covered the topics of tragedy, comedy and history. A couple of years later he was already affiliated with different theater companies in London and in the year 1599 he and others established the Globe theater.

As he is one of the most renowned authors of universal literature, and considered the father of English literature, he is an iconic cultural figure. But he is as iconic in popular culture, as well. Nowadays his figure and his legacy of works remain present in media or entertainment. Shakespeare popularized phrases and expressions that today can be seen or heard; or even give title to modern works ("To Be or Not To Be, 1942; North by Northwest, 1959"). 

Shakespeare was one of the key elements of the final development and establishment of Early Modern English, along with other factors like the printing industry in London, and A Table Alphabetical, the first English dictionary. This happened by the late 16th century and the early 17th. He also influenced other writers (for example, Lord Byron); and these writers influenced later to others. So the influence of Shakespeare has been reminiscent through the years.

Regarding the English language, he introduced several new idiomatic expressions and words, as mentioned before. Some of them are still used nowadays. It is calculated that Shakespeare created around 1700 new words (for example: "deafening", "hush", "hurry", "downstairs", "gloomy", "lonely", "alone", "dawn"). Apart from creating brand new words, he also created words in many ways: changing nouns into verbs, changing verbs into adjectives, connecting words that had never been used together before, etc. He also added prefixes and suffixes to many words. He was influenced by Latin and French to create new words. 

The lack of grammatical rules during Shakespeare’s time and the flexibility of the language made it possible for him to coin new terms and influence the development of the English language. The disappearance of inflectional endings is one of the things that made grammatical conversions (using a word class with a new function) grow. Shakespeare used this procedure, especially to turn nouns into verbs: “The wild disguise has almost anticked us all.” (to make a fool of); “Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle…”. 

The Old English “thou” and “ye” (singular and plural respectively) were slowly substituted by Early Modern English “you”, as the difference between subject “ye” and object “you” had disappeared. By Shakespeare’s time, in the singular, it was also an alternative to “thou” and “thee” and was used as a formal way to refer to someone. Moreover, “thou” and “thee” were used by people of higher rank to refer to the ones who were above them. “Thou” could also be used if a lower rank person wanted to refer to someone of higher rank with the purpose of disrespecting them, and Shakespeare made the most of it. For instance, he used to express that its use can be seen as a challenge: “If thou thou’st him somethrice, it shall not be amiss” (Twelfth Night) 

Shakespeare’s vocabulary is estimated to have included about 24000 words, even probably 28000. Thus, the great popularity of his works led to the introduction of new words and idioms into the English language, many of which are still present in ordinary life today. 

Some examples of words that became known for his works are the following: eyeball, barefaced, fashionable, accommodation, apostrophe, bloody, critic, dislocate, exposure, generous, hurry, impartial, lonely, monumental, obscene, pious and suspicious, among many others. 

In “Romeo and Juliet”, he introduced the words ladybird and uncomfortable. Ladybird is said by the Nurse at the beginning of the third scene in “Romeo and Juliet”, and uncomfortable by Capulet in Scene 5. As a further example, the word outbreak appears in “Hamlet”, in Act 2, Scene 1. 

In both of these works he included new idiomatic expressions as well, by combining common words into a new semantic unit and adding a figurative sense to the resulting whole. “Hamlet” contains the expressions my own flesh and blood, meaning “a relative of mine”, and in my heart of hearts, “deep within myself”; while the idiom wild-goose chase, meaning “a search that turned out to be a waste of time”, has been taken from “Romeo and Juliet”. 

Shakespeare also introduced words that were then adapted to a different form. The present idiomatic expression “all that glitters is not gold” was originally “all that glistens is not gold”, included in The Merchant of Venice, Act 2, Scene 7. The meaning of this idiom is that things are not always as good as they appear to be. 

Estimates suggest that Shakespeare invented approximately 1700 words. However, some academics argue that the real number might be lower. It is possible that many of these words had been in common use for years and Shakespeare was simply the first person that wrote them down. Many written texts from Shakespeare’s period did not survive the years, so even if other people wrote them down, they might no longer exist. Without written records, it is almost impossible to say who used the phrase first. Many words that have been attributed to Shakespeare are simply modern modifications that can be traced back to older forms. 

Other academics argue that the Oxford English Dictionary has been favouring Shakespeare when it comes to inventing new words. According to Jonathan Hope "the Victorian scholars who read texts for the first edition of the OED paid special attention to Shakespeare: [H]is texts were read more thoroughly, and cited more often, so he is often credited with the first use of words." For example, some of the commonly used phrases that are incorrectly attributed to Shakespeare are: all that glisters is not gold, laughing stock, out of the question, the naked truth etc.

John Cheever

John William Cheever (May 27, 1912 – June 18, 1982) was an American short story writer and novelist.

He was born in 1912 in Quincy, Massachusetts. His family had money trouble when he was a teenager. His mother ran a gift shop. He had to leave Thayer Academy because he had bad grades. He wrote a short story about this. It was printed in the "New Republic" when he was 18.

Cheever did not go to college. He had jobs in a department store and at a newspaper. He moved to New York City in 1934. The writer Malcolm Cowley, whom he met through the "New Republic", told him to write lots of stories, and he did. Two were printed in "The New Yorker".

He met Mary Winternitz in 1939, and they married in 1941. After the Pearl Harbor attack, he joined the U. S. Army. He worked for the Signal Corps propaganda unit in New York. While he was in the army, in 1943, his first book was published. It was a short story collection, "The Way Some People Live".

In 1951 Cheever moved with his wife, daughter, and son to Westchester County outside of New York City. Another son was born in 1957.

Cheever's good work at writing was noticed during his life. He got Guggenheim Fellowships in 1951 and 1960. Stories he wrote won Benjamin Franklin and O. Henry awards. He was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1957. His first novel, "The Wapshot Chronicle" won the National Book Award in 1958. "The Wapshot Scandal" of 1964 won the Howells Medal as the best work of fiction to be published between 1960–1965. "The Stories of John Cheever" won both the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1979. He was given the National Medal for Literature in 1982, two months before he died from cancer.

After his death, many memoirs, journals and other writings talked about Cheever's bisexuality, his marriage troubles and alcoholism.

Esoteric Programming Language

An esoteric programming language is a programming language used to instruct computers in a unusual way. These languages, also called "esolangs", are usually made to test how unusual a programming language can get, or simply as a joke.

By far, the oldest esoteric programming language is INTERCAL. INTERCAL was created in 1972 by Don Woods and James Lyon. The two said that their intentions were to create a unique programming language, that wasn't like any that they had used themselves.

In 1993, Wouter van Oortmerssen created FALSE, which was a language designed for unreadable and confusing code, however it had a compiler of just 1024 bytes. FALSE inspired brainfuck, with the idea of creating a even smaller compiler.

While the features and idea of different languages can be extremely different, some common themes occur. Typically, languages are designed so that programs are hard to write in them, or to have as little commands as possible. For reference, brainfuck has just 8 commands.

Multiple people have designed concepts for a computer that runs mainly, or solely on the language brainfuck, most importantly, Sang-woo Jun, at MIT published a paper on their concept. This computer consists of 256 cores, with 50 billion instructions per second.

Hart Crane

Harold Hart Crane (July 21, 1899 – April 27, 1932) was an American poet.

Crane was born in Garrettsville, Ohio, in 1899. His father made candy and owned restaurants. He was successful and had much money. Crane's parents did not have an easy marriage. He spent much time with his grandmother. Her library had books by Robert Browning, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Walt Whitman.

In 1913 Crane started at East High School in Cleveland, but he was not a very good student. His mother often took him out of school for travel. He never graduated. Crane's father wanted him to work in his business, but Crane wanted to write poetry. He thought he might go to Columbia University, so he moved to New York in 1916. He didn't enter Columbia. He got jobs at some literary magazines, "The Little Review" and "Seven Arts".

In 1917, his parents divorced. His mother came to New York and lived with him in his small apartment. He tried to join the army when the United States entered World War I, but he was too young. He went back to Cleveland. He worked in an ammunition factory.

In 1921, he had a fight with his father that ended their connection for some years. By the time he moved back to New York in 1923, he had written many poems for his first book, "White Buildings". 

He worked for an advertising company in New York, and he fell in love with a sailor. This love affair helped him to write the poem "Voyages". He was also working on a long group of poems called "The Bridge". When "White Buildings" came out in 1926, he became known as a very good poet. Reviews of "The Bridge", when it came out in 1930, were not as positive. His friends Allen Tate and Ivor Winters were unhappy with the poems. This was hard for Crane to take, and his writing slowed down.

In 1931 he got a Guggenheim fellowship that let him travel to Mexico. In Mexico City he got to know the writer Katherine Anne Porter and the painter David Sequeiros. He also began his 'first and only heterosexual affair" with his travelling companion Peggy Cowley.

On April 27, 1932, Crane was on a ship that was going to Havanna, Cuba. He jumped into the Gulf of Mexico and drowned.

San Francisco Renaissance

The San Francisco Renaissance is a name for the work of a group of poets in San Francisco in the 1950s and '60s. This poetry made San Francisco famous in the 1950s as a place where new writing was happening. The "renaissance," or "re-birth," was not one thing. It describes the coming together of many different groups and individuals.

A poetry reading at the Six Gallery on October 13, 1955 was the first public event. It was organized by older poet Kenneth Rexroth. During this reading, five poets—Allen Ginsberg, Philip Lamantia, Michael McClure, Gary Snyder, and Philip Whalen—read their work. The most exciting was Ginsberg's reading of his long poem "Howl". This is called the beginning of Beat poetry. But other kinds of poetry—like those connected to the Black Mountain School—were also part of the San Francisco Renaissance.

Other poets who are part of the Renaissance are Robert Duncan, Robert Creeley, Jack Spicer, Joanne Kyger, Robin Blaser, and William Everson.

After the 1960s, the Renaissance continued in the poetry of Robert Hass, Robert Pinsky, Denise Levertov, Lorna Dee Cervantes, Victor Hernández, Ron Silliman, Leslie Scalapino, and Lyn Hejinian.

Inauguration of James A. Garfield

The inauguration of James A. Garfield as the 20th president of the United States happened on March 4, 1881. It was the start of James A. Garfield's only term (a partial term of 199 days) as president and the only term of Chester A. Arthur as vice president. 

Garfield did not finish his term in office because he died on September 19, 1881, after being shot by Charles J. Guiteau on July 2, 1881. As a result, his vice president, Chester A. Arthur, become the next president.

Chief Justice Morrison Waite administered the presidential oath of office to Garfield.

In his inaugural address, Garfield spoke of several topics, such as his views on African American suffrage, the gold standard, illiteracy, and the practice of polygamy by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Before his inauguration, Garfield had difficulty writing his speech, rewriting it three days before he was sworn in as president.

Two inaugural ceremonies happened because March 4, 1877, was on a Sunday. The first ceremony was done at the White House, and the second ceremony was done at the East Front of the United States Capitol Building. The event was the 23rd presidential inauguration and the first ceremony was the first time a president was sworn in at the White House.

The first ceremony was done secretly and with a lot of security because of how controversial the presidential election was in 1876. It was so controversial that Ulysses S. Grant, the outgoing president, was afraid a revolt would happen by those who supported Samuel J. Tilden, Hayes's opponent in the election. However, Grant assured that any attempts to take over the ceremony would not succeed.

The second ceremony happened two days later, this time in public. The quote, "He serves his party best who serves his country best," comes from his inaugural address. Hayes also was the first president to not mention God in his inaugural address.

2022 Nigeria floods

The 2022 Nigeria floods affected many parts of the country. From the Federal Government Data, the floods rendered over 1.4 million people homeless, killed over 603 people, and injured more than 2,400 persons. About 82,035 houses had been damaged, and 332,327 hectares of land had also been affected.

While Nigeria frequently experiences seasonal flooding, this flood was the worst in the country since the 2012 Nigeria flood.

As of October, over 200,000 homes were completely or partially destroyed by the floods. On 7 October, a boat carrying people fleeing the floods from Ogbaru capsized on the Niger River, causing 76 deaths.

The flooding was caused by heavy rainfall, climate change, as well as the release of water from the Lagdo Dam in neighbouring Cameroon, which began on 13 September. Flooding, which affected Nigeria, Niger, Chad, and the surrounding region, began in the early summer of 2022 and ended in October.

The Nigerian government has blamed the floods of 2022 on unusually heavy rains and climate change. United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria Matthias Schmale said that the flooding could be largely explained by climate change. Climate change in Nigeria has been responsible for flooding, droughts, decreased air quality and the loss of habitat.

A climate modeling study by the World Weather Attribution project estimated that the floods were rendered far more likely and much more intense by climate change. They modeled the June to September rainfall in the Lake Chad and lower Niger river catchment areas, looking at total rainfall and intense rain weeks.

Flooding increased on 13 September with the perennial release of water from the Lagdo Dam in neighbouring Cameroon. Excess water released from the dam cascades down River Benue and its tributaries, flooding communities in the states of Kogi, Benue, and other states in the northeast. When Lagdo Dam was constructed in 1982, there was an agreement by Nigerian authorities to build a second, twin dam in Adamawa State to contain the overflows. Known as the Dasin Hausa Dam project, it was to be situated in Dasin Village of the Fufore local government area, but was never built by the Nigerian government.

Nigerian Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management & Social Development Sadiya Umar Farouq said that "there was enough warning and information about the 2022 flood" she blamed local governments, states, and communities for not acting promptly despite the warnings.

The indiscriminate construction on natural flood plains and storm water paths together with poor drainage systems in many residential areas clog channels with waste. Lax enforcement of environmental laws has only exacerbated problems even further.

Natural disasters in Nigeria

Natural disasters in Nigeria can be referred to as an event in Nigeria leading to the loss of lives and properties as a result of climate change in the country. Natural disasters of a place can be caused by flooding, erosion, insect infestation, etc.

There have been several forms of disasters related to climate change in Nigeria, some of which are flooding, soil and coastal erosion, landslides, tidal waves, coastal erosion, sand-storms, oil spillage, locust/insect infestations, and other man-made disasters. It can be said that the country's under-protected and expansive environment contributed to making the people especially vulnerable to these disasters. Other dangers include northern dust storms, which are usually from northern states to southern states; causing damages through large deposits of dust and dirt from these regions. Hail (Small ice pellets or sleet That is mostly translucent, e.g Snow) is another cause, which rarely occurs in some parts of Nigeria, leading to damage to crops and properties. 

This section explains different kinds of disasters that had happened in Nigeria to date.

There was a drought in 1972 and 1973 that lead to the death of about 13% of animals in the northeastern part of Nigeria and also an annual agricultural yield loss of about 50%.
The rainfall trend between 1960 and 1990 in northeast Nigeria steadily declined by about 8 mm/year.
Nigeria's most recent drought was between 1991 to 1995
Flood
Constant events of flooding in different parts of Nigeria had led to socioeconomic damage, injury, and loss of life.

The 2022 Nigeria floods affected many parts of the country. Data collected From the Federal Government shows that floods had displaced over 1.4 million people, killed over 603 people, and injured more than 2,400 people. About 82,035 houses had been damaged, and 332,327 hectares of land was also been affected.

According to Adamawa State Emergency Management Agency (ADSEMA) On the 11th and 12th of August, two days of uninterrupted rainfall happened in the State, which caused flooding that affected 66 houses and destroyed about 150 farmlands in Lababiri Village in Adamawa State. The incident which also affected 79 communities in 16 Local Government Areas, killed about 7 people and left 74,713 people homeless in the same state.

Order of Victory

The Order of Victory () was the highest military decoration awarded for World War II service in the Soviet Union, and one of the rarest orders in the world. The order was awarded only to Generals and Marshals for successfully conducting combat operations involving one or more army groups and resulting in a "successful operation within the framework of one or several fronts resulting in a radical change of the situation in favor of the Red Army." In the history of the Soviet Union, the award had been awarded twenty times to twelve Soviet leaders and five foreign leaders, with one revocation. The last living recipient was King Michael I of Romania, who died on 5 December 2017.

Os renovadores

Os Renovadores (the Renewers) or Os Novos (New ones) was a diverse group who wanted to renew visual Galician arts from the 1920s.

Maside, Souto, Colmeiro, Seoane, Eiroa, Mazas, Torres and Laxeiro are considered members of "Os Novos"; Jose Frau is sometimes named; Virxilio Blanco, who went young to Cuba, is also included. For their influence, Castelao, Camilo Díaz and Asorey are considered part of the group. Some others were the surrealists Granell, Mallo and Urbano Lugris, and, later, Maria Antonia Dans, Elena Gago, Angel Johan, Colombo, Cebreiro, Pesqueira, Concheiro and Bonome. Isaac Díaz Pardo, son of Camilo Díaz, continued the legacy of his family and renewed the forms of design and ceramics.

In "Séculos Escuros age" there were efforts to preserve the dignity of Arts (Compostelan Baroque), Science and Education (by Sarmiento and Benito J. Feijoo), and Literature.

In the 19th century, there was a resurgence ("Rexurdimento") in poetry. In painting, there is an affinity for romantic and post-impressionist landscapes influenced by Cézanne. Some Galicians, like Valle-Inclán, accused the artistic primacy of the Madrid-Valencia axis inside Iberian Peninsule.

Some promising artists died young and were called the 'Sick Generation'.
In Europe, the vanguards grew up. Some Spaniards (mostly Catalans as Miró or Dalí) went to France. In the 1920s, 'Group Nós' wanted to link Galician culture to Europe, and 'Xeración do 25' emerged ( literature "renovators"). Artists born in the 1900s and 1910s don't break with olders, such as Baliño, Castelao or Asorey, and they try to renew art tradition. Writers and designers gather around "El Pueblo Gallego", which published both in Spanish and Galician.

In 1921, Santiago Ramón y Cajal gave Castelao a scholarship to learn about the avant-garde. For him, art must be universal and linked to the 'mother culture'. When he knew Central European art, he made some offensive comments about Picasso, who after his training in Galicia and Catalonia was creating Cubism in Paris"." Castelao prefered the Russian new art because it was ""linked to the people"". Later, he published an essay saying that the vanguards could be ""crazy, but not silly"," and he wrote to the poet Manuel Antonio about old and new art roots. He spent one year traveling and he wrote in his diary:

Carlos Maside traveled a lot. His work was shown in the US by the Carnegie Institute, along with Mallo and Souto. In Paris, he saw Gaugin and Van Gogh art. It influenced his work beyond Cubism, Magic realism, Expressionism and the Bauhaus professor Kandinsky. Maside made graphic works for the Autonomy campaign, collaborated with Seminar on Galician Studies, and suggested an Art Library in Santiago. He stayed in inner exile and made friends with younger artists like Laxeiro and his nephew Xulio.

Manuel Colmeiro was another artist who traveled a lot. After the war, he went into exile in Argentina, where he created murals in Galerías Pacífico. In exile, he interacted with artists like Seoane, Dieste, and Alberti. He moved to Paris in 1949 and in 1989 he returned to Galicia. In the 60s, he had exhibitions in London and won several awards in the 80s. He died in Salvaterra de Minho in 1999 at the age of 98. His daughter Elena Colmeiro was also an artist, specializing in sculpture and ceramics.
Seoane talked to Freixanes about the concerns of students in Compostela during the first part of 20th century:
""Simplicismus" interested a lot, within the "art nouveau". The European artistic and intellectual center began to move from Paris to Berlin both in painting and the visual arts as well as in philosophical and political thought (...) Austria was also very present, Paul Klee, Grosz... All of this, although it may seem curious, it was known in the restless Galicia of those years."
Asorey, born in 1889, made figurative art, but with new themes and expressionist texture. He wasn't as iconoclast and abstract as the avant-garde, but he caused controversies. He sculpted a Virgin with a host on her chest for A Estrada and the priest didn't want it. That iconography was also used by Díaz in his posters for the Statute of Autonomy of Galicia, with the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Galicia (today official of the Autonomy). The war took him many friends, but he continued in internal exile. This led to some oblivion later, according to his family. Asorey made monuments to great figures of culture, such as the Enlightenment philosopher Benito J. Feijoo, the writer Curros Enríquez or the astronomer from Lalín, Pontevedra, Ramón Mª Aller. In 2019, Asorey's sculpture "A Santa" returned to Galicia for an exhibition, after 70 years in Montevideo. The sculpture, created in 1926, received criticism from the Queen of Spain for breaking political correctness at the time. However, Asorey later stated in a press interview in 1956 that this was the work he was most satisfied with.

The movement in Galicia was less disruptive than other vanguards. They valued tradition and they were also very cosmopolitan, and the work of other people was fundamental to that movement, from "Nós" generation to scientists of the Seminary of Galician Studies, archaeologists, etc. Enrique Campo with only four years of work but very intense, practiced with new fields of drawing, archeology and scientific illustration.

Some of the "Renovators" were influenced by surrealism, like vivarian painter Maruxa Mallo, who had strong ties with surrealists such as Bretón, Lorca and Buñuel. She was far from his homeland, but the Galician sea was included as a theme in her work. During the fascist uprising, Mallo was in Vigo and managed to escape to Portugal. With the help of Gabriela Mistral, Chilean ambassador in Lisbon, could travel to Americas, where she was in touch with Seoane. Other artists marked by the war were Francisco Miguel, killed in 1936; he worked with Siqueiros and illustrated works by Borges and Mistral. The painter Urbano Lugrís, son of Lugrís Freire, an intelectual contrary to Franco, was forced to take the side of fascism, like other artists. He also worked on set designs and architecture, such as the "Surrealist chapel of Magi," in Bueu.

In the 1920s, members of Irmandades were involved in theater and founded Escola Dramática Galega, with notable playwrights such as Cotarelo Valledor and Vicente Risco. Noriega Varela and Cabanillas bridged the gap between 19th century and the avant-gardes. Cabanillas assimilates the poetry of Curros, Rosalía de Castro and Pondal, also taking modernist elements. Rafael Dieste was the most prominent author in the "Generation of 25", and the scenography was diverse, with surrealist and symbolist elements. Lorca founded "La Barraca" in the early 1930s where Lugrís and Ernesto G. da Cal participated in the scenography. Lorca wrote "Six poems in Galician" in 1935 as a result of his friendship with them.

Galician humor and satire have a long tradition, from sneering medieval poems to modern-day comics (the first Galician comic strips are published in 1888 and in the first decades of XX drawing was analysis tool in the key of socio-political criticism or "charge"). Authors like Risco and Otero Pedrayo, who portrayed Diego Gelmires as a "comedian," used satire to comment on Galician society. Pioneers of puppetry like Barriga Verde reflected with humor the quarrels between Galicians and Portuguese, as Gabriel Feijóo had done centuries before"." Artists like Maside and Díaz drew inspiration from illustrations and caricatures of Central European humor. Castelao and Luis Bagaría (although Catalan by birth, he was a close friend of a lot of Galician artists) were two of the most influential graphic humorists in Galicia, and Vázquez Díaz combined classic portraits in sculpture with satire in his penguin, closely linked to surrealism, for which he suffered censorship.

The renewal of art influenced the next generation of Galician artists, called by some "Segundos Renovadores". The exiles participated in drawing, painting, murals, architecture, typography and ceramics. Artists such as Seoane, the Granell brothers, Mallo and others found a great echo in the internal exile. Bello Piñeiro, promoter of the Sargadelos pottery, founded upon their return to Galicia by Luis and Maruxa Seoane and Díaz Pardo among others.
The renovators created fonts and recovered traditional typography in stone, continued by Laboratorio de Formas. Recent creators have made fonts based on them, like "Vila Morena" (Ipanema Graf) and "Gallaecia Castelo" (Carlos Núñez).

Marcos Dopico and Natalia Crecente from the University of Vigo analyzed their typographic program. They combined traditional fonts from different origins with the systematization of Bauhaus and Ulm schools, and according to Díaz Pardo, the Soviet Vkhutemas.

Atlantihyla

Atlantihyla is a genus of frogs in the family Hylidae. These frogs live in Honduras and Guatemala in Central America. Scientists named these frogs "Atlantihyla" because they live on the east side of the narrow piece of land, which is the same side as the Atlantic Ocean. These frogs are named stream frogs in English.

Scientists made the genus using information about DNA. Julián Faivovich and colleagues looked at the subfamily Hylinae in 2018. They moved two former "Ptychohyla" species to "Atlantihyla" and four former "Ptychohyla" species to "Quilticohyla." "Atlantihyla" is a sister group with "Bromeliohyla", "Duellmanohyla", and "Quilticohyla". A third "Atlantihyla" species was described in 2020.

These frogs only look alike in one way: They have a white stripe on the sides of their bodies and a ridge on their backs. Adult male frogs are and adult female frogs are long from nose to rear end. The tadpoles have large mouth discs.

There are three species in this genus:

AmphibiaWeb says this genus is monotypic, with "Atlantihyla melissa" as the only species in it.

Atlantihyla melissa

Atlantihyla melissa is a frog. It lives in Honduras. Scientists have seen it between 780 and 1680 meters above sea level in the Cordillera Nombre de Dios mountains. This place is in a park called Refugio de Vida Silvestre Texiguat.

The adult male frog is 30.4 - 38.8 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 30.9 - 43.9 mm long.

This frog can be many colors. Some frogs have spots and some do not. Most frogs have a stripe down the sides of their bodies, which can be light or bright yellow. Adult male frogs look different from adult female frogs. Adult male frogs can have pink eyes or red eyes. Adult female frogs have green eyes or brown eyes.

These frogs live near streams and rivers where the water moves fast and the bottom of the river is covered in rocks. People have seen these frogs sitting on plants that hang over the water. Because the adult frogs hide, scientists have heard the male frogs even when they have not seen them.

The tadpole can grow to be 47.1 mm long before becoming a frog. The tadpole has a large mouth disk on the bottom of its body. The young frogs climb out of the water in July or July.

This frog only lives in one place. Because human beings cut down trees and build things in that place, this frog is in danger of dying out.

Scientists named this frog for Isis Melissa Medina-Flores. Medina-Flores is a life scientist. She helped study this frog and other frogs nearby. In 2016, she disappeared in the mountains.

Ceiba stream frog

The Ceiba stream frog ("Atlantihyla spinipollex") is a frog. It lives in Honduras. Scientists have seen it between 160 and 1580 meters above sea level in the Cordillera Nombre de Dios mountains.

During the Qing dynasty, Buddhism once again became the main religion, both in Outer Mongolia and Inner Mongolia.

In the 20th century, the persecution of Mongol monks and other Buddhists happened under the rule of the Mongolian People's Republic. Mongolia imposed state atheism under the pressure of the Soviet government.

50th Anniversary of the Republic Sculptures

The 50th Anniversary of the Republic Sculptures are 20 sculptures that were made for Istanbul. They were made by Turkish sculptors as a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish Republic. The sculptures were put in different parks and squares in Istanbul around the year 1973. Many of them were damaged, destroyed, lost, or moved. Only some of them are still there.

It was not easy for Turkish sculptors to show their work in public spaces between 1950 and 1960. There were not many types of sculptures (other than monuments) in Turkey until 1973. In May 1972, a committee in charge of celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Turkish Republic held a meeting at the headquarters of the Governor of Istanbul. They wanted to have 50 sculptures made to celebrate the anniversary. But, because they didn't have enough money, they reduced it to 20. The committee chose 20 artists to make these sculptures. On 13 September 1973, the committee approved sketches and photographs sent by the 20 artists. This was an important event in the history of Turkish sculpture. For the first time, sculptors were able to create sculptures that were not monuments for public spaces. This supported the idea of modern sculpture in Turkey. The results of the project were 20 sculptures put up in public spaces in Istanbul. These sculptures were made by well-known sculptors, and were in their original style.

Many of the sculptures were lost, damaged or removed. Some of them were damaged only a few days after they were put in their place. "Güzel İstanbul" by Gürdal Duyar was thought by some traditional conservative people to be inappropriate. It was removed from Karaköy Square and eventually taken to Yıldız Park. "İşçi" by Muzaffer Ertoran was attacked. No one knows what happened to "Mimar Sinan" by Nusret Suman"." "İkimiz" by Namık Denizhan was removed because of damage. "Birlik" by Mehmet Uyanık was destroyed by a water compressor in 1986. "Yükseliş" by Bihrat Mavitran was destroyed to make more space for a road in 1984. "Yağmur" by Ferit Özşen was damaged and then removed. Many of the sculptures were abstract art. The abstract sculptures that got lost are: the one by Füsun Onur that was removed when Bedrettin Dalan was the mayor in 1985, the one by Seyhun Topuz that collapsed due to "natural causes" in 1984, and the one by Tamer Başoğlu which disappeared in 1986. The sculptures made by Yavuz Görey and Metin Haseki were probably stolen by scrap dealers because they were made of valuable metal.

In 2011, seven of the sculptures were cleaned and restored. This event was known as the "sculpture project". "Yankı" by Hüseyin Anka Özkans was made to look new again, according to what was reported. As of September 2011, there was a plan to restore the "Abstract sculpture" in Maçka, the "Bahar" sculpture in Emirgan Park, the Republic 50 Years Monument in Galatasaray Square, the "Dayanışma" sculpture in Fındıklı Park, the "Figür" sculpture in front of the Muhsin Ertuğrul Theater, and the abstract sculpture at Bebek children's park.


Negro Rebellion

The Negro Rebellion was a series of revolts and uprisings in Eastern Cuba. It began around May 20th, 1912 and ended in July. The rebellion was crushed by the government, with help from William H. Taft and the United States, and both leaders were killed in the war. This rebellion saw the formation of the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade.

The American military came in to protect American Companies in Cuba and saw combat there. Over 3,000 Afro-Cuban rebels were killed during the war, some estimates put that at 6,000 deaths. The government claims only 12 men were killed during the war. Some sources (such as Guillermo Lara) claim that 2,000 men were killed , but North American estimates put it at 5,000-6,000.

After the discovery of America, slavery was introduced and over 800,000 people were enslaved in Cuba, as Cuba was the largest Slave Hub. These were primarily Taínon and Guanahatabey peoples who mixed with the slaves from Africa, thus making Afro-Cubans. There was also a genocide against the Taínon by the Spanish. Evaristo Estenoz made the Partido Independiente de Color which was a party that wanted equality for Afro-Cubans in the sugarcane industry, as many of them were employed there. When the PID was first made, many Afro-Cubans supported the movement since it pushed for equality and better working conditions.

The Banana Wars were a series of wars, conflicts, rebellions and occupation by the United States between the end of the Spanish-American war in 1898 and 1934. The United States Army would usually fight there and the United States Navy sometimes provided support. They took place in Central America and the Caribbean, in these countries:

But on August 1st, 1934, Franklin D. Roosevelt pulled out all U.S soldiers in occupied territories. There was a manual of what to do in the wars called the "Small Wars Manual" which was written by experienced soldiers of the United States Marine Corps. This manual was also used in the War in Iraq by the 1st Infantry Division.

In 1895, the PID started the War of 1895 which was unsuccessful, but the PID regrouped in 1912 and also caused some unrest. As a response, the United States sent 688 police officers and marines to the Naval Base at Guantanamo base under Major George C. Thorpe. They garrisoned the Naval base and secured it in case of any further unrest. During the time they were there, the PID was arming themselves and getting ready for a rebellion.

Even though they didn't have many guns, they still had several hundred men, mostly peasants, and were lead by Evaristo Estenoz. Later, the rebellion had several thousand men. But before the uprising, José Miguel Gómez, the president of Cuba ordered that the party be disbanded under the Morúa law.

On the 20th of May, Estenoz and his rebellion fought the Cuban National Army. The fighting took place in Oriente Province, where most Afro-Cubans were. But there was also some fighting in Las Villas Province in the west, . At first, the rebels were winning against the Cuban National Army. The army was being pushed back. On May 23rd, the president José Miguel Gómez requested help from William H. Taft, the president of the United States.

On the 28th of May, the first United States Marines landed in Deer Point, Guantanamo Bay under Colonel Lincoln Karmany. The 1st Provisional Regiment of Marines had about 809 men. Once they landed they were ordered to meet up with Major Thorpe's battalion which was in Guantanamo Bay's Naval Base.

The Cuban government and news talked terribly about the rebels and started rumors and propaganda. The president ordered that his people to fight for "Civilization", and fight against "ferocious savagery." He also showed a picture of a "raped teacher" which was confirmed to be fake news and Cuban government propaganda by "El Dia" a conservative newspaper. 

"El Dia" wanted Cuba to copy the Jim Crow laws from the United States, which segregated black people and mistreated them, giving them less rights than a white man. They also argued that "dominated races do submit". But Afro-Cuban politicians were against this and were worried by the racism and anger that the rebellion caused. The reputation of Juan Gualberto Gomez, an Afro-Cuban, was also damaged because he wrote a manifesto against the racism.

On June 7th, the 2nd Provisional Regiment under Colonel James E. Mahoney landed at Guantanamo Bay. It had 1,292 men and officers. The 1st battalion landed in Havana, Cuba, on June 10th. The USS Mississippi also sent a detachment to El Cuero on June 19th. For the men that landed in Guantanamo, only one battalion was commanded. The rest were under Colonel Karmany, who took command of all unassigned troops and organized the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade.

In total, there were about 2,789 American men and officers in total in Cuba. Half of them were sent to occupy towns and cities and the other half was kept in Guantanamo. The Marines also guarded American sugarcane plantations, copper mines, railroads and trains that were owned by American companies. The Afro-Cubans attacked the Marines only one time, at El Cuero but they lost the battle and both sides suffered 0 casualties.

During June of 1912, Estenoz started losing a lot of land to the Cuban National Army, his rebels became less organized and many died. Before June there were about 3,000 men, but after it went to about 1,800 men. Some sources say that over 6,000 men were killed. President José Miguel Gómez offered peace to any rebels who would surrender by June 22nd, but Estenoz rejected this offer and continued to fight with a couple hundred men. Most other rebels surrendered.

Estenoz was killed on the 27th of June, after he was shot in the back of the head by soldiers in the Cuban National Army. After he died, the rebel factions became smaller. The most important faction of rebels was under Pedro Ivonnet, who escaped to the mountains and started to use guerrilla warfare. 
But he was pushed out of the mountains and surrendered on July 18th. He was killed when he tried to escape. At that time, the war was over.

After Estenoz died, President José Miguel Gómez announced that the Marines were no longer needed, and they started to withdraw from Cuba. They went from Guantanamo Naval Base to bases in the United States. The last Marines to leave Cuba left on August 2nd, on the USS Prairie.

The Negro Rebellion had other names used by the Government, people, rebels and the press. These were:

After the Rebellion ended and the United States Marines left Cuba, it was reported that between 2,000 and 6,000 people died, including civilians and combatants. The Cuban National Army said that they only lost 12 men. The PID was also dissolved because there was nobody to lead it. The Cuban government was victorious and the entire rebellion was put down. Those who didn't surrender were killed or went home.

1200 Afro-Cuban rebels surrendered but about 500 of them made it home. The bodies of both of the leaders, Ivonnet and Estenoz, were put in public to humiliate them. They were also buried in normal and common graves to not signify them or make them a public figure.


Supergroup

A supergroup is a musical group whose members are successful as solo artists or as members of other successful groups. The term became popular in the late 1960s for when members of already successful rock groups to recorded albums together, after which they normally disband. Charity supergroups, in which prominent musicians perform or record together in support of a particular cause, have been common since the 1980s. The term is most common in rock and pop music, but it has occasionally been applied to other musical genres. For example, opera superstars The Three Tenors (José Carreras, Plácido Domingo, and Luciano Pavarotti) have been called a supergroup.
A supergroup sometimes forms as a side project for a single recording project or similar purposes, with no intention that the group will remain together afterwards. In other instances, the group may become the primary focus of the members' career.

In 1974, a "Time" magazine article titled "Return of a Supergroup" said that the supergroup was a "potent but short-lived rock phenomenon" which was an "amalgam formed by the talented malcontents of other bands." The article acknowledged that groups such as Cream and Blind Faith "played enormous arenas and made megabucks, and sometimes megamusic", with the performances "fueled by dueling egos." However, while this "musical infighting built up the excitement ... it also made breakups inevitable."

"Rolling Stone" editor Jann Wenner credited British rock band Cream, which came together in 1966, as the first supergroup. Eric Clapton, formerly of rock band The Yardbirds and blues rock band John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers; Jack Bruce, formerly of jazz/rhythm and blues band the Graham Bond Organisation (GBO) and John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers; and Ginger Baker, formerly of the GBO, formed the band in 1966, recorded four albums, and disbanded in 1968. Guitarist Clapton and drummer Baker went on to form Blind Faith, another blues rock supergroup which recruited former the Spencer Davis Group and Traffic singer, keyboardist, and guitarist Steve Winwood and Family bassist Ric Grech. The group recorded one studio album before disbanding less than a year after formation. Also in 1968 Jack Bruce joined the Tony Williams Lifetime, composed of bassist and vocalist Bruce, and three famous Miles Davis alumni: drummer Tony Williams, guitarist John McLaughlin, and keyboardist Khalid Yasin (né Larry Young).

The term may have come from the 1968 album "Super Session" with Al Kooper, Mike Bloomfield, and Stephen Stills. The coalition of Crosby, Stills & Nash (later Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young) in 1969 is another early example, given the success of their prior bands (The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, and The Hollies respectively).

Rönesans Rezidans

 
<mapframe latitude="36.229974" longitude="36.149454" zoom="17" width="260" height="150" align="right" text="Location on İnönü Blv." />Rönesans Rezidans (Renaissance Residence) was a residential building in Ekinci, Antakya, that fell over in February of 2023 during the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake. It was the first luxury apartment in Hatay Province.

The building was built between 2011 and 2012. It was the home of generally more wealthy people in Antakya. It was kind of a luxurious residence. It was built by Antis Yapi, a company that was established many years ago. When it fell over during the first earthquake it might have trapped or killed at least 800 people. Rescue efforts looking for survivors are still ongoing. It was said that the structure of the building was strong, and that it did not collapse but it was instead tipped as Dr. Ahmet Ercan explains. The shockwave got bigger on its way from Gaziantep, where the epicentre of the first earthquake was. When the shockwave arrived in Hatay Province it had gotten so big that it caused much more intense and violent shaking of the ground in Hatay.

Architect/Engineer Yoshinori Moriwaki said that the building did not have friction piles which he says would have prevented it from falling over. The building did have a floating raft system. Geophysics Professor Ahmet Ercan said that the foundation of the building should have been deeper. He said that it looks 3 meters deep but it should have actually been about 10 meters deep.

The Ekinciler Belde Municipality gave the permits for the building in 2013. Lütfü Savaş said that the building was probably build correctly and followed regulations.

The building is the first residenz (Turkish: "Rezidans") in Hatay. It was built to be a home for families that are working in the growing border trade business in Hatay. Hatay is next to the Syrian border. The building was home to around 700 residents. Other people have said that almost 1000 residents lived in the building. The building is 12 floors high and has a total 249 homes, 2 shops. The building is divided into 4 blocks. The area that the building takes up on the ground is large.

The homes range from squared. The building had amenities such as a half Olympic sized pool, jacuzzi, gym, sports facilities, children's playground, a place for cars to park under a roof, secretary and reception services, walking and biking paths, wakeup service, shop, 24/7 security services and waterfalls. Mehmet Yaşar Coşkun was the Chairman of the Board of Antis Yapı when the building was made. He said that this project will "create an area where all kinds of social activities can take place". The need for parking spaces is answered inside the building. Keeping the cars inside keeps the outside without cars and free and open for activities to take place.

Building started in 2011 by Antis Yapı. The first of the building was started with a ceremony which was attended by: Hatay MP Sadullah Ergin, Hatay governor H. Celalettin Lekesiz, mayor Lütfü Savaş, chief constable Ragıp Kılıç and mayor of Ekinci municipalit Seyfettin Yeral. The plan was to finish building in April 2013. It was finished in 2012. The company Antis Yapı was started by the architect Mehmet Yaşar Coşkun and engineer Hüseyin Yalçın Coşkun.

The license for the building was given by the Ekinciler Belde Municipality in 2012 accordign to Lütfü Savaş.

The building was constructed onto a floating raft foundation. People thought the building can survive earthquakes.

The building fell over after the first earthquake of the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes, which affected Hatay. People beliebe that there are 800 people under the building.

People got angry at the building because many older buildings that were close were still standing as of 17 February, while Rönesans Rezidans had fallen over. Dr.Ercan has explained that the concrete wasn't bad, but the foundation was not deep enough. Also the shockwaves of the first earthquake arrived in Antakya with a much bigger than was expected. According to Dr. Ercan, the disaster might not be the fault of municipality or contractor or the building inspection board. He says there needs to be a proper analysis of the situation that takes into consideration how exactly the earthquake waves affected the building. The investigation should be done by geophysics experts, and they should not rush to put the blame on anyone and also not rush to forgive anyone. However the rubble of the building was already cleared out by 24 February even though the building was cleared up it is still not known how many people died because of the collapse.

Lütfü Savaş who is the mayor of Hatay Province said that the building was built correctly and did what it needed to to survive an earthquake. He is confident that this is true because the architect was an idealist, and he was also a former president of the Chamber of Architects. He said that everyone will be questioned of course. It would be bad not to. They will look for anything that might be missing.

Professor of Geophysics Dr. Ahmet Ercan said that the shockwave of the earthquake had increased instead of reducing in magnitude when it arrived in Antakya. It had increased so much that it was more than gravity but in the opposite direction of gravity. This means that buildings were thrown up into the air from the ground and pushed sideways even if they were strong constructions. "Rönesans Rezidans" shows this. The building is knocked over but it has not collapsed. All the columns and beams look strongly attached to each other and show no sings of breaking.

A rule of thumb is that for every 5 floors above ground there should be 1 floor under the ground. It looks like the foundation floor is about deep, but according to the rule it should have been about deep.

Japanese Architect and Engineer Yoshinori Moriwaki also interpreted the collapse of Rönesans Rezidans. He said that the length of Rönesans Rezidans played a part in its collapse. A long building is fine but should use friction piles. Friction piles would have increased the price of the whole project by about 10%. The stakes would go all the way down to where the ground is more stable. He said that even though it fell over, there was actually not much damage to the structure. No matter how strong the building is, a bad foundation can lead to the building collapsing. According to some sources the building was constructed on a floating raft system which is a system used when the ground under a building is too soft for friction piles.

Moriwaki compared the relationship of architects and engineers in Turkey and Japan. He said that in Turkey the architect is very powerful. In Turkey for example the boss is an architect and the engineer works for the architect. In Japan however, since the 1995 Kobe earthquake and the 2011 Sendai-Miyagi earthquake/Fukushima disaster, Japan changed the system to give more power to the engineers.

According to some reports residents were already worried about the buildings structure before it collapsed.

The roughly 250 residential units of the building was a home to 700-1000 people. They were generally the more wealthy residents of Antakya.

Members of the Hatayspor team were living in the building. Team manager Volkan Demirel also previously lived in the building and two of his neighbors died. Player Christian Atsu and technical director Taner Savut were Hatayspor members under the wreckage. A thermal imaging camera determined signs of life in the wreckage and it was reported that Atsu had been rescued but that Savut is still missing, later it was later reported that Atsu is also still missing. Atsu might have been on the 9th floor when the building collapsed, his body was found by 18 February confirming his death. Taner Savut was also later identified and confirmed dead in a hospital in Adana. Handball player Cemal Kütahya along with his wife and kids, and educator Hülya Aydın were also missing in the wreckage. Kutahya and one of his sons have since been reported dead.

Many doctors lived in the building. Doctor Şebnem Turan Adıgüzel who was rescued from the rubble said that some of her colleagues had unfortunately died.

A Hungarian rescue team saved 12 people. Hungarian Firefighter Lieutenant Colonel Dániel Mukics personally rescued a resident named Selma from the wreckage at the 47th hour. He was part of a 55-person team. A team of 75 Turkish coal miners saved 40 people in the 7 consecutive days that they were at the scene. A team from China has also been working building. The Erzurum Search and Rescue Team (ERAKUT) who belong to the Erzurum Metropolitan Municipality Fire Brigade Department also arrived at the wreckage and were involved in the rescuing of a 9 year old boy.

The contractor of the building, Mehmet Yaşar Coşkun, was arrested at the airport in Istanbul. He was on his way to Montenegro where he said he was working on some other projects. He said his trip had nothing to do with the earthquake and that his trip was not an attempt to run away. He was sent to Metris Prison. The locations of the project manager İbrahim Dahiroğlu and the site manager Bayram Mansuroğlu are unknown. Coşkuns lawyer said that "the public is looking for a criminal, a culprit. My client was picked as this culprit". Coşkun said that the building was strong and had all the necessary licenses.

Kelvin Doe

Kelvin Doe (born October 26, 1996, in Freetown, Sierra Leone), is a Sierra Leonian engineer.

Born in a poor area of Freetown, Sierra Leone, Kelvin Doe is the youngest of five. The area lacked electricity and water, and it was so unreliable that the lights would only come on once a week. At the age of 10 he started collecting old devices and scrap metal to create something new out of it. He would do this by taking apart the old devices to see how they work, and then piece them back together as new inventions that came straight out of his mind. He built batteries and transmitters out of discarded pieces of scrap. Later he participated in GMin’s Innovate Salone idea competition, where he got to the finals and built a generator from scrap metal. He used the living room as his workstation where he built batteries for power lamps, and generators for electricity when it was not available.  

He made a radio transmitter and started his own radio station under the name DJ Focus. The inspiration for the name came from his belief that with focus, anyone can achieve what they strive for.  Kelvin was only 15 years old when he built the radio station, which he used to broadcast news, music and messages for peace and unity to his community. Kevin built the generator that powered the radio station. He built it of scrap metal, acid and soda. He later has continued to create and innovate. 
Kelvin now owns and runs his own tech company as a CEO. The company is called “K-Doe Tech, Inc” where he designs and sells consumer electronics.  

Kelvin has won many international awards. One of them is called “the presidential Gold Medal”. Because of his great accomplishments, he received an invitation to the United States. He was invited to participate in a program in the famous technology university called   The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He is the youngest person to have participated at this program.

Biosphere 2

Biosphere 2 is a 3.14-acre (1.26-hectare) place of research in the United States.

It is a closed ecological system located in Oracle, Arizona. It was designed as a technological system to explore the complex web of interactions within a closed ecological system. The facility consists of five biomes—a tropical rainforest, an ocean with a coral reef, a grassland savanna, a fog desert, and a mangrove wetlands—each of which is an independent and self-sustaining ecosystem. The facility was built between 1987 and 1991 and was sealed from the outside environment and stocked with 3,800 species of plants and animals, including humans, and was intended to be a self-sustaining system for two years. After two years of operation, it was opened to the public in 1993. The experiment ended in 1994, but the facility remains open for research and educational uses. Biosphere 2 continues to be used to research the effects of climate change and other environmental issues, as well as to help build a better understanding of how closed ecological systems work and how they can be used to address global problems.

Brook silverside

The brook silverside ("Labidesthes sicculus") is a North American species of Neotropical silverside. The brook silverside lives in slow moving rivers and lakes from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River. The brook silverside survives best in clear water with aquatic vegetation. The brook silverside occupies freshwater lakes, ponds, quiet pools and small rivers.

The brook silverside breeds in the summer from late May to mid-August. Their life span is only one year. During the first year, they have rapid growth, growing up to one millimeter per day. Brook silversides quickly reach a maximum size of approximately eight centimeters. 

They reach sexual maturity by the first summer in order to reproduce. Some studies report that brook silversides reproduce by internal fertilization, although this has not been entirely confirmed. When the eggs are produced, they have an attached filament, which allows for the eggs to be deposited on wood, plants and rocks. 

Temperature does not affect the sex of fish. After the eggs hatch, they immediately swim away from the shore into deeper water, but still stay just under the surface. They congregate in large schools. The brook silverside migrates throughout its life cycle. No human-induced changes are reported as affecting the life history. Human-induced changes are reported as more strongly affecting populations rather than behaviors.

Human intervention through species introduction, habitat alteration, pollution, and construction are causing the decline of the brook silverside and other freshwater fishes. Freshwater fishes account for the majority of extinctions in ray-finned fishes. To stabilize and increase populations, no more dams or waterways should be built. Additionally, pollution must be stopped. Agricultural runoff creates turbid waters, which the brook silverside cannot thrive in. Stream sampling occurs through organizations such as USFWS and TVA (locally). This allows for populations to be monitored and stream chemistry to be controlled. Over-fishing and hybridization aren't causing brook silverside populations to decline. Invasive species and habitat destruction have the greatest impact on population decline. Areas are being reserved for the preservation of endemic fish, but more must still be done.




Neotropical silverside

The Neotropical silversides are a family, the Atherinopsidae, of fishes in the order Atheriniformes. They also include the brook silverside. About 112 species in 13 genera are distributed throughout the tropical and temperate waters of the New World, including both marine and freshwater habitats.


Atheriniformes

The Atheriniformes, also known as the silversides, are an order of ray-finned fishes that includes the Old World silversides, the Neotropical silversides, and several less-familiar families. The only prehistoric silverside is "Palaeoatherina". You can find them in tropical and temperate marine and freshwater environments.

Nelson 2016 classifies the families as follows:




Lunar time

Lunar time refers to the time on a clock on the moon. As of early 2023, there is no standard lunar time. Instead, the time on the moon is different for each country involved. Thus, American activities on the moon run on an American time zone, and Chinese activities on the moon run on China Standard Time. As more countries are active in the moon and interact with each other, a different, unified system will be needed.

The European Space Agency has proposed a lunar reference time for the moon to solve this issue.

Now, only about ten percent of businesses in PNG are owned by indigenous people. Haoda Todd and other business people wanted to help indigenous Papua New Guinean people start businesses. In 2011, at the Indigenous Business Summit and Trade Expo, people from over 750 indigenous-owned businesses said they needed to make an organization to help indigenous people start new businesses and lead them well. 

In 2012, the Indigenous Business Council began. Running a business is difficult in PNG. PNG needs better infrastructure. This means there is not enough electricity. Roads are in bad condition. People do not know enough about technology. People do not know how to have businesses. It is hard to get a business loan from a bank. The Council trains people to run businesses. It protects indigenous owned businesses. 

The Indigenous Business Council had no money. Haoda Todd organized fundraisers to pay for the Council. The PNG government then gave the Indigenous Business Council US $500 million. 

Haoda Todd was Secretary of the Indigenous Business Council from 2011 to 2013.

Haoda Todd wants to build the PNG fashion industry. She hopes to help indigenous people become fashion designers.

Cancridae

Kol HaAm

Kol HaAm was a daily Hebrew newspaper of the Communist Party of Palestine and its successor, the The Israeli Communist Party (Mki), which was published between the years 1937 and 1975. The ruling in the petition filed by the newspaper against its closure, known as the "High Court of the People's" (1953) constitutes one of the important formulations for the protection of freedom of expression in Israel.

"Kol Ha'am" began to be published as a monthly in August 1937 without a performance license. The newspaper identified with the policy of the Soviet Union and expressed full confidence in the Soviet regime, even during Stalin's time.

From 1942, Kol Ha'am began appearing as a weekly and following many public and legal efforts, the mandatory Ministry of the Interior granted a publication license to the newspaper. The first legal issue was published on December 20 1944.

The newspaper's editors over the years included the senior MK members: Shamuel Mikunis, Moshe Sana, Esther Wilenska, Meir Wilner and Zvi Breitstein. The poet Alexander Penn served as the editor of the newspaper's literary section for most of its existence. In the section, the works of young authors such as Hanoch Levin and David Avidan first saw the light of day.

In 1965, with the split in the MKI between the majority that took a critical approach towards the Soviet Union and the minority that remained loyal to the Soviet Union and founded the Rakha, "Kol Ha'am" remained under the control of the MKI, And the members of Rakh established a competing newspaper called "This is the way". After the split, MK remained a small opposition party, and the newspaper gradually faded until it was closed in 1975.

The newspaper did not support itself and its funding came from donations from members and friends of the PKP. The newspaper managed fundraisers to finance its activities. In the 1950s, recruitment quotas were distributed to different regions of the State of Israel, and the newspaper published how each region met the quota.

The newspaper's editors have been prosecuted several times for defamation. In September 1948, the newspaper accused a number of police officers of having tortured and murdered the communist activist Sioma Mironyansky in 1941, while he was serving in the Criminal Investigation Department of the Mandate Police. In response, the officers demanded that the editors of the newspaper be prosecuted for defamation Ma'ariv. However, after further examination, it was found that there is truth in the claims and an investigative committee was established to examine the circumstances of Mironyansky's murder. In February 1951, a trial was opened on charges of defamation against the newspaper's editors for an article from September 1949 in which the Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, was called a "traitor to the people", "pulling the American imperialism" and other nicknames. At the trial, Ben-Gurion claimed that the article was intended to harm Soviet Union-Israel relations. The defense attorney for the Kol HaAm argued, however, that the purpose of the trial is to suppress the Israeli Communist Party. In December 1951, the newspaper was accused of defaming the Minister of Police and inciting rebellion for an article published on July 8 1950. In July 1952 the newspaper was closed for a week because of censorship.

The Kol HaAm adopted the blood plot of The Doctors' Trial in 1953 and described in its headline the banned Jewish doctors as "a gang of murderous doctors in the service of American-British espionage". On this background, the government sought to ban the existence of MKI and, among other things, discussed the possibility of closing Kol Ha'am. In January 1953, the Minister of the Interior, Israel Pharmacist ordered the closing of the newspaper for ten days. according to a law from the British Mandate era that permits the issuing of a closure order to a newspaper that publishes things that may harm the public peace. The newspaper submitted a petition to the Beg 3 against the closure, but the High Court refused to issue a conditional order in the matter. In March 1953 the Minister of the Interior again ordered the closing of the newspaper for ten days, this time because of an editorial article under the title "Aba Ibn will go to fight alone", in which the newspaper appeared against the alleged statement of Ambassador Israel Abba Even, according to news that appeared in Haaretz, that Israel will place hundreds of thousands of soldiers alongside the United States in the event of a war with the Soviet Union. Among other things, the newspaper wrote: "We will increase our fight against the anti-national policy of the Ben-Gurion government which is permeated with the blood of the Israeli youth." This time the High Court issued a conditional order against the action of the Minister of the Interior and suspended the closure of the newspaper until the Kol Ha'am petition against the closure is investigated. The ruling on the petition, which became known as the High Court of the People's Voice, was published on October 16 1953. The ruling written by the Judge Agrant with the consent of the judges Moshe Landoi and Yuel Sussman, stated that freedom of expression is a fundamental right that is an inseparable part of democracy. The authority of the Minister of the Interior to close a newspaper on the grounds of public peace is limited to cases in which there is near certainty of a risk to public peace from the newspaper's publications. Referring to the case of Kol Ha'am, as well as the newspaper Al-Ittihad which published similar things and even issued a closure order against it, it was ruled that the published words are far from indicating a near certainty of a danger to public peace and therefore canceled the order the closing This ruling was a milestone in Israeli jurisprudence and law, in establishing freedom of expression as a fundamental right and as an example of the court's authority to cancel an action carried out by the executive authority in violation of a fundamental right if certain conditions are met, such as the test of near certainty.

In June 1953, three charges were filed against the newspaper for insulting the honor of foreign rulers. One of the charges was due to a scathing article against John Foster Dulles under the title "Know Foster Dulles, Know Your Enemy". Judge Benyamin Halevi dismissed the charge and subsequently the Attorney General announced the cancellation of the other two charges In July 1953, Habib Shiver's lawsuit against Kol Ha'am for calling him a "fascist adventurer" and accusing him of selling in the the black market a paper he received for election propaganda. Kol Ha'am won the trial and Shiver was ordered to pay legal costs to the newspaper.

As of , Shoham had a population of . Its jurisdiction is 5,889 dunams (~5.9 km).

A plan to establish a town in the area that is now Shoham was first proposed in the 1960s, as an idea to establish a town for immigrants from South America. It was again proposed in the 1970s. However, residents of nearby moshavim wanted to build a rural community for the adult children of farmers in cooperative communities. In the early 1990s, Israeli Housing Minister Ariel Sharon put forward a new plan to create a town in the area. Construction began in 1993, when the first 300 homes were built. From then on, the town grew rapidly. By 1995, it had 3,100 residents, and by 2014, had reached a population of 20,000.

Shoham is a middle-class town, and residency there is considered a status symbol in Israel. In terms of average wages and the rate of high school students who complete their matriculation, Shoham residents rank well above the national average. Its residential areas primarily have single-family homes with yards and duplexes, although there are a few apartment complexes. According to "Haaretz", it has a small-town, community-oriented feel, but offers most of the services found in bedroom communities, including shopping centers, a high school, and a middle school. The environment is considered a top priority in Shoham, and each neighborhood has municipal gardens and green spaces. The town's parks and gardens cover over 400 dunams, and are dotted with sculptures. The town has a performing arts center, sports facilities, a public library, and a retiree center and activity club.

Monad (functional programming)

Monads are a way of organizing code in functional programming languages. They provide a structure for handling complex operations that involve multiple steps or may fail at some point.

In simpler terms, a Monad is like a box that holds some value or computation. You can use certain operations, like 'bind' or 'map', to extract the value from the box, modify it, or put it into another box.

One of the benefits of using Monads is that they can help you write more readable and maintainable code, by separating the concerns of handling errors, side effects, and pure computations.

Some common examples of Monads in functional programming languages include the Maybe Monad for handling null values or errors, the List Monad for dealing with collections, and the IO Monad for working with input/output operations.

Blastocyst

The blastocyst is a stage of development that occurs in most mammals. The blastocyst has two basic types of cells. One of them is called inner cell mass. This will form the embryo. The outer layer of cells will form the two membranes which surround the embryo. 

In humans, the blastocyst starts to form about five days after fertilization. About seven days after fertilization, the blastocyst attaches itself to the wall of the uterus. 

With in vitro fertilization, the fertilized egg gets transferred to the uterus. When this is done it is two to three days after fertilization. It is difficult to predict which eggs will develop best. For this reason, several are usually transferred to the uterus. Often this leads to multiple pregnancies (multiple eggs developing into embryos). When a blastocyst is transferred, five to six days after fertilization, this problem does not occur. It is also easier to transfer a blastocyst and attach it to the wall of the uterus.

Brevicipitidae

Brevicipitidae or rain frogs are a family of frog species. They live in eastern and southern Africa. As of 2020, scientists say there are 37 species in 5 genera in Brevicipitidae. Scientists used to think of Brevicipitidae as a subfamily in the family Microhylidae (narrow-mouth frogs). By studying phylogenetics, the scientists changed their minds. Now they think brevicipitine frogs are their own family. Their closest relatives are the frogs in family Hemisotidae (shovelnose frogs).

Most adult brevicipitine frogs are not easy to see. They dig into the soil or dead leaves. Sometimes, some of these frogs climb trees. In most of these frogs, the adult female frog is much bigger than the adult male frog.

The frogs in "Breviceps" and "Probreviceps" do direct development. That means their eggs hatch into in small frogs. They are never tadpoles. When it is time for the male frog to fertilize the female frog's eggs, frogs in "Breviceps" "glue" themselves together using sticky chemicals from the holocrine glands on their bellies and backs. The frogs lay small clutches of 13–56 eggs (4–8 mm diameter not including the protective capsule). Sometimes, the frog digs a burrow, or hole, for the eggs. In some species, one parent stays near the eggs.

Panderichthys

Panderichthys is a genus of extinct sarcopterygian (lobe-finned fish). It lived in the late Devonian period, about 380 mya. Possible tetrapod tracks dating back to before the appearance of "Panderichthys" in the fossil record were found. This suggests that "Panderichthys" is not a direct ancestor of tetrapods. It shows the traits which evolved during the fish-tetrapod evolution. 

Decreased oxygen in the atmosphere would have caused the oxygen concentrations in water to decrease. This would have caused any aquatic animal which could breathe air to have an advantage, and be more likely to thrive. 

In addition to its ability to swim in water, "Panderichthys" could also breathe air. Its strong pectoral fins might allow it to prop up its head in shallow water and take a breath.

"Panderichthys" is a 1.5–2 m (4 ft 11 in6 ft 7 in) long fish with a large tetrapod-like head that is flattened, narrow at the snout and wide in the back. 

In January 2010, "Nature" reported well-preserved and "securely dated" tetrapod tracks from Polish marine tidal flat sediments approximately 397 million years old. These fossil tracks suggest that a group of two meter long tetrapods lived in the fully marine intertidal or lagoonal areas on the south coast of Laurussia. This implies that "Panderichthys" is not a transitional fossil and represents its own adaptive morphology. Therefore, "Panderichthys" can only be a "late-surviving relic", showing traits that evolved during the transition from fish-like creatures to tetrapods, but whose date does not reflect that transition. The tracks "force a radical reassessment of the timing, ecology and environmental setting of the fish–tetrapod transition, as well as the completeness of the body fossil record".

Plans started in 1944 to build a network of primary health centres to cover the whole country. By 1967 there were about 4000 but many had no doctor. At that time there were 85 medical schools. 

The Indian Medical Journal said in 1966 that quackery was common in the country. The 1961 Health Survey pointed out that traditional medicine did not deal with public health or preventative medicine. It had little to say about obstetrics or gynecology.

Needles, California

Needles is a small city in San Bernardino County, California. It is in the hot, dry Mojave Desert, on the west side of the Colorado River. Needles is across the river from Arizona, and about 12 miles from Nevada. It is along Interstate 40. As of 2020, 4,931 people live there.

Needles was named after a group of pointy rock columns, on the Arizona side of the river. These were called "The Needles". The town was founded in 1883 when people were building a railroad (the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway). They needed a bridge to cross the Colorado River. At first, there was only a group of tents where workers lived. Soon, people built stores, restaurants, laundries, and saloons. Needles was the largest port, north of Yuma, on the river.

This was actually a bad place to build a bridge. The sides and bottom of the river were unstable. When the river flooded, the bridge broke apart three times – in 1884, 1886 and 1888. The railway decided to take it down. They built a new bridge ten miles to the south. This part of the river had a solid rock bottom. The new bridge was complete in 1890. 

Many people were starting to cross the country on railroads. A man named Fred Harvey decided to build restaurants and hotels near train stations. He built one of the first restaurant chains. The El Garces Hotel in Needles was one of his most famous hotels. People thought it to be the "crown jewel" of the Harvey company. Needles was a major stop on the historic U.S. Route 66 highway from the 1920s through the 1960s. For migrants from the Midwest Dust Bowl in the 1930s, it was the first town they saw in California. Needles has many motels and other shops from that time.

Hundreds of thousands of people visit Needles every year.

Platymantis spelaeus

The cave wrinkled ground frog ("Platymantis spelaeus") is a frog. It lives in the Philippines on Negros Island. It lives in forests and in caves in limestone rock. Scientists have seen it between 20 and 400 meters above sea level.

The adult female frog is 52.8-60.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult male frog is 41.5-46.9 mm long. The skin on the frog's back is dark green or brown in color, with brown marks. There are dark marks on the tops of the back legs. The insides of the back legs are orange or light purple in color. The belly is almost white and sometimes has brown spots.

Sickness can kill this frog. Human beings change the places where it lives by cutting trees down.

Foobar

Foobar, and sometimes foo and bar separately, are common placeholder names in computing. 

Foobars have been used to name variables, functions, and commands whose exact identity is unimportant. For example, a JavaScript tutorial might explain that two variables can be created at once with the code var foo, bar = 5. It's a lot like the placeholder letters x and y in algebra.

Callulina

Callulina (commonly known as the warty frogs) is a small genus of frogs in the family Brevicipitidae. There are nine species in this genus. They live in Tanzania and Kenya. For a long time, scientists thought that there was only one species in "Callulina", a frog that lives in the Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania and in southern Kenya. However, they found eight more species. Most of these frogs are in danger of dying out.

Amphibian Species of the World says there are nine "Callulina" species.

Krefft's warty frog

The frog lays eggs during the dry season. The mother frog sits on the eggs until they hatch. The eggs hatch into small frogs. They are never tadpoles. The frogs become adults in about eight months.

This frog is in danger of dying out because human beings change the places where the frogs live. Humans cut trees down to get wood to build with, to make places for animals to eat grass, and to build towns and cities.

Scientists named this frog for William T. Stanley of the Chicago Field Museum. Stanley has studied living things in the Pare Mountains.

Direct development

Direct development is an idea in biology. An animal does direct development if the baby animal looks like a small adult and not a larva. A frog that hatches out of its egg as a small frog has direct development. A frog that hatches out of its egg as a tadpole does not. An insect that hatches out of its egg as a small adult does direct development. An insect that hatches out of its egg as a caterpillar or grub does not.

Direct development is the opposite of complete metamorphosis. An animal does complete metamorphosis if it becomes a non-moving thing, for example a pupa in a cocoon, after being a larva but before being an adult.


Pungi

Callulina laphami

Lapham's warty frog ("Callulina laphami") is a frog. It lives in Tanzania. It lives in the North Park mountains. People have seen it between 1730 and 2000 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is about 22.8-29.0 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 33.5-45.4 mm long. This frog is different from other frogs in "Callulina" because the round eardrum is not easy to see and because its toes are shorter. The skin of the frog's back is dark brown in color. The skin on the frog's sides is light brown in color. The skin of the frog's belly is light in color. There is a line between its eyes. This line is bright red in most frogs but bright green in some frogs.

During the day, this frog sits under logs or rocks near streams. At night, it sits on medium-sized woody plants or tree branches.

The frog lays eggs during the dry season. The mother frog sits on the eggs until they hatch. The eggs hatch into small frogs. They are never tadpoles. The frogs become adults in about eight months.

This frog is in danger of dying out because human beings change the places where the frogs live. Humans cut trees down to get wood to build with, to make places for animals to eat grass, and to build towns and cities.

Jan Jongbloed

Jan Jongbloed (; born 25 November 1940) is a Dutch former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He played with the Netherlands national football team. His style of play made him comparable to an added defender: he often collaborated in the construction of the action, embodying the spirit of total football. Regarded as one of the best Dutch goalkeepers of all time. He was the starting goalkeeper for the Netherlands at the 1974 and 1978 World Cups. Jan played an unusual role as an offensive goalkeeper, one of the pioneers of the sweeper-keeper, a rather rare feature in those years. More skilled with his feet than with his hands, he hardly ever used gloves on the pitch.

His career began in 1959 defending goal for DWS, a small club from his hometown Amsterdam. This won the newly promoted title in the 1963–1964 season and in 1972 it was transformed, with a merger, into FC Amsterdam. Jongbloed moved to Roda JC in 1977, then to Go Ahead Eagles in 1981, before ending his career at 45 due to a heart attack; having played his last game in the Go Ahead Eagles at the age of 44 years, 9 months and 14 days he is still the oldest player to have played a game in the Eredivisie. He is also still the record holder for the number of matches played in professional football (707).

Jongbloed made international debut on 26 September 1962 in a 4-1 defeat against Denmark. This remains his only presence for almost twelve years; in fact, he is called up only in view of the 1974 World Cup, even though he is not even a professional  (in fact he manages a tobacco shop). Called up in place of the more popular Jan van Beveren and fielded by Rinus Michels in place of Piet Schrijvers from the first match (contrary to public opinion), he reached the final having conceded only one goal, moreover an own goal from Ruud Krol, they were then defeated in the last act 2-1 by the hosts West Germany.

After being called up in the Dutch expedition participating in the 1976 European Championships, but without ever being used, Jongbloed was also called up by Ernst Happel in the following 1978 World Cup. Here too he starts, despite being replaced in the first two games of the second phase after the three goals conceded against Scotland (Schrijvers plays in the matches against Austria and West Germany). Jongbloed returns to the field during the decisive match against Italy, after Schrijvers was injured by colliding with his teammate Ernie Brandts on the occasion of the goal of the momentary blue advantage. Then play the final and also on this occasion Holland was defeated by the home team, Argentina. Jongbloed ends his militancy in the national team with this match, in which he has collected a total of 24 appearances. He broke a goalkeeper record as an international: 683 minutes without conceding a goal.

From the beginning of 1988 he was an assistant coach at Vitesse, in which the first major success followed in 1989; trainer Bert Jacobs became champion of the Eerste Divisie. The following year, fourth place in the Eredivisie was reached with European football as a reward. In between, the club also reached the cup final, in which PSV was too strong. In the years that followed, Vitesse always finished in the top six and participated in the UEFA Cup nine times. In October 1999 he did the honors for the dismissed Herbert Neumann together with Edward Sturing. Jongbloed did the same with Frans Thijssen four years earlier, after Ronald Spelbos had to leave. Since 2000 he has been active as a youth coach at the Arnhem club. In 2010 it became clear that his contract with Vitesse would not be extended. The Zaanse amateur association Hellas Sport then appointed Jongbloed as a technical advisor. Jongbloed was last active as a youth trainer at ZVV Zilvermeeuwen, also from Zaandam.

Jongbloed was married twice and twice divorced; he has a daughter Nicole. His son Eric was also a football goalkeeper with DWS. He was hit by lightning and killed, aged 21, during a match on 23 September 1984.

Ride the Cyclone

Ride the Cyclone is a musical about six teens, all part of a Canadian school choir, dying in a freak roller coaster accident. Before they all died, a fortune-telling machine read their fortunes, knowing they would ride the doomed rollercoaster and could tell them nothing. Before the children would pass into the afterlife, the fortune-telling machine brings their souls there to present an offer. He says that he can bring back one of the souls beyond death, and back to life. (It is unknown if this is for recreation or other purposes). This offer is presented as a contest, giving each student a chance to come forward and present their case for why they should return to life.

First, Ocean O'Connell Rosenberg, a cheerful school girl raised in a liberal family, sings about how she is the only one worth living because of her grades and grade point average. Once she finishes, Noel Gruber (who is introduced as the only gay guy in his small town) sings about how he want to be a sex worker in post-World War Paris, France. After a few more songs ("Every Story's Got A Lesson", "This Song Is Awesome"), Mischa sings about rap and his long-distance girlfriend Talia. Ricky Potts, a boy who makes his entrance with his trusted walking-canes, sings about his religion and how he'll hope to find his leaders. Constance Blackwood, the girl said to be Ocean's best friend, sings about her life and how she loves her small town. 

Although everyone else sings about happiness, Jane Doe sings about her despair and her longing for knowing who she really is, as she lost her head when she died and holds no memories of who she was in life. The choir wants to help her, so they throw her a fake birthday party. Karnak changes the rules at the last second, and chooses Ocean (since she had the highest grade point average) and tells her she has the ability to choose who returns to the land of the living. Ocean votes for Jane Doe, revealing her identity - her name being Penny Lamb. The musical then ends on a cliffhanger.



These are usually sang by all six of the teenagers and sometimes the Amazing Karnak; for the songs meant to be solos the rest of the group provides background vocals.

When Daniel was seven, his younger brother Johann Bernoulli II was born. While he was still in school, his father Johann encouraged him to study business. However, Daniel refused, because he wanted to study mathematics. But he then followed his father's will and studied business. His father then asked him to study medicine, and Daniel agreed with the condition that his father would teach him mathematics privately.

He had a close friendship with Leonhard Euler. He arrived St. Petersburg in 1724 as professor of mathematics. But with unhappiness there, Bernoulli fell ill in 1733 giving him an excuse to leave. He returned to the University of Basel, where he successfully held chairs in medicine, metaphysics and natural philosophy, until his death.

His first mathematical work was Exercitationes, which was published in 1724 with the help of Goldbach. Two years later, he showed for the first time the analysis of an object's motion into translational and rotational motion. Daniel Bernoulli's main work is the Hydrodynamique (Hydrodynamica) published in 1738, it was similar to Joseph Louis Lagrange's Mécanique Analytique. It classified the results into a single principle, the conservation of energy. Bernoulli also wrote a large number of different questions in the field of mechanics, especially problems connected with vibrating strings, and the solutions were given by Brook Taylor and Jean le Rond d'Alembert.

Daniel Bernoulli was the first to formulate the aerodynamic theory, and he applied the ideas to explain Robert Boyle's laws.

He worked with Euler on physical elasticity, developing the Bernoulli equation, Bernoulli's principle, and aerodynamics .



Index (publishing)

An index is a detailed list of information in a printed publication. This information can include names of people, places, things, events, or ideas that a reader may want to find. Next to each name is a page number. 

In a printed book, the index is found at the end. It should not be mixed up with the table of contents, which is placed near the beginning of the book. The table of contents gives the order of chapters within the book. The index is different from the table of contents because it gives the page location of detailed information inside the book. 

The words in an index are given in alphabetical order, first words beginning with A, then with B, then with C, and so forth.

Indexing as we know it today had to grow over a long time of history. It depended on the invention of the alphabet. It depended on the invention of the book (or codex, at first). And, as we have it today, it depended on the invention of the printed book. Gutenberg's printing press of around 1440 made this possible. The first printed index is found in St. Augustine's "De arte praedicandi". This book was made in the early 1460s in Mainz, Germany by the printers of the Gutenberg bible.

Indexes today are usually made by paid professionals who are hired by the publisher when the book is ready to be printed. Often these indexers are members of professional groups, such as the Society of Indexers in Britain or the American Society for Indexing.

Neuropeptide

Neuropeptides are chemical messengers made up of small chains of amino acids. When they bind to receptors, they cause nerve activity. They also act on other tissues like the gut, muscles, and heart. There are over a hundred different types in our bodies.

Peptides are ancient signalling systems that are in almost all animals on Earth (sponges are the exception). 

Neuropeptide signalling may predate the development of nervous tissues or neurotransmitters. They are the largest and most varied type of signalling molecules in the nervous system.

There were no babies in poetry then. How could that have been? What are we leaving out now?" 




Wedgwood

Wedgwood is an English fine china, porcelain and luxury accessories manufacturer. It was founded on 1 May 1759 by the potter Josiah Wedgwood in Stoke on Trent. The firm was very successful in the eighteenth century. They had huge sales all over Europe and America, but his descendants were less successful. The firm was based in Etruria, next to the Trent and Mersey canal in Burslem until 1938 when Josiah Wedgwood V moved it to a new site in Barlaston, a few miles to the south.

The move was successful and the firm was turned into a limited company in 1967. It took over many other pottery firms in Stoke. In 1986 there were 12,000 people working for the company across the world and it had sales of £152 million. In 1987 the company merged with Waterford Crystal. The new company was called Waterford Wedgwood plc. It took over companies in other countries and by 1999 it had $300 million debts. After 2001 it started sacking workers. In 2005 it bought the Royal Doulton company, which had a factory in Tangerang, Indonesia. The pottery was all made there. In 2008 it had debts of £470 million and assets of only £50 million. Most of the remaining workers were sacked. 

The business was bought by Fiskars Group, a Finnish company in 2015.

Trent &amp; Mersey Canal

The Trent and Mersey Canal is a 93⁄-mile (150 km) canal in Derbyshire, Staffordshire and Cheshire. It was made to link the River Trent in Derbyshire to the River Mersey, connecting the ports of Hull and Liverpool. 

The plan was made by the canal engineer James Brindley. It was agreed by an Act of Parliament in 1766 and the first sod was cut by Josiah Wedgwood in July that year at Burslem. In 1777, the canal was completed, including more than 70 locks and five tunnels. Wedgwood used the canal to bring clay into his potteries and to send the finished products to Liverpool. He built his factory village called Etruria on the outskirts of Stoke-on-Trent, close to the canal. 

Between Middlewich and the northern end of the canal in Preston Brook Tunnel, is the Victorian Anderton Boat Lift, which lowers boats fifty feet from the canal to the River Weaver. Just North of Stoke is the Harecastle Tunnel. Brindley built the first tunnel which was 2,880 yards (2,630 m) long, and boats were moved through by men lying on their backs and pushing against the roof with their feet. Thomas Telford built a second, wider, parallel tunnel with a towpath in 1827. The first tunnel was later closed because the land sank. 

James Brindley

James Brindley (1716 – 27 September 1772) was an English engineer. He was born in Tunstead, Derbyshire, and lived much of his life in Leek, Staffordshire. He was one of the most notable engineers of the 18th century.

In 1750 he rented a millwright's shop in Burslem from the Wedgwoods who became his lifelong friends. He built several flint mills for the pottery trade. He was involved in the building of the Bridgewater Canal and the Trent & Mersey Canal. In total Brindley built 365 miles (587 km) of canals and many watermills, including the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, the Coventry Canal, the Oxford Canal and numerous others, and he also constructed the watermill at Leek, which is now the Brindley Water Museum.

Thomas Telford

Thomas Telford (9 August 1757 – 2 September 1834) was a Scottish civil engineer. One of his earliest works can still be seen on the bridge across the River Esk in Langholm in Dumfries and Galloway

From 1787 he designed churches, roads and canals in Shropshire. He built 40 bridges in Shropshire, including major crossings of the Severn at Buildwas, and Bridgnorth. The bridge at Buildwas was Telford's first iron bridge. In 1793 he managed the detailed design and construction of the Ellesmere Canal, to join the ironworks and collieries of Wrexham with Chester, using the existing Chester Canal, and then the River Mersey. This involved the spectacular Pontcysyllte Aqueduct over the River Dee in the Vale of Llangollen, where Telford used a new method of construction consisting of troughs made from cast iron plates and fixed in masonry. Running for over 1,000 feet (300 metres) 126 ft (38 m) above the valley floor, the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct has nineteen arches, each with a 45 ft (14 m) span. 

Then he designed lots of projects in his native Scotland, including the building of the Caledonian Canal, as well as harbours and tunnels and some 920 miles (1,480 km) of new roads and over a thousand new bridges in the Highlands of Scotland. He built the Menai Suspension Bridge, the longest suspension bridge at the time. He was called the Colossus of Roads (a pun on the Colossus of Rhodes), and he was elected as the first president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, which he held for 14 years until his death.

The town of Telford in Shropshire is named after him.

Caledonian Canal

The Caledonian Canal connects the Scottish east coast at Inverness with the west coast at Corpach near Fort William in Scotland. The canal was built in the early nineteenth century by the Scottish engineer Thomas Telford. It is about 60 miles (100 kilometres) long and reaches 106 feet (32 metres) above sea level. Only one third of the entire length is man-made, the rest is made up of Loch Dochfour, Loch Ness, Loch Oich, and Loch Lochy in the Great Glen. There are 29 locks, four aqueducts and 10 bridges in the course of the canal.

It was designed partly as a job creation project, as many people were leaving Scotland. It was also for ships to avoid the dangerous journey around the north of Scotland past Cape Wrath and the Pentland Firth. It was paid for with government money, unlike most British canals, with an Act of Parliament in 1803. The locks were built to take 32-gun frigates for the Royal Navy.

It opened in 1822 and cost £910,000.

Part of Corpach double lock collapsed in 1843 and the canal was closed for repairs, and made deeper. Queen Victoria took a trip along it in 1873 and it became more of a tourist attraction than a shipping route. It is now is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

Kemalism

Kemalism is a political philosophy or ideology which was used when the Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923. It is named afer Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Atatürk defined six principles, which he called arrows:

Outpatient clinic

An outpatient department or outpatient clinic is the part of a hospital for people with health problems who visit the hospital for diagnosis or treatment, but do not at this time need to stay in the hospital. Modern outpatient departments offer a wide range of treatment services, diagnostic tests and surgical procedures.

In the past patients with long term problems would come regularly to these clinics, sometimes once a year and sometimes more often. The COVID-19 pandemic meant this was seen as dangerous, so there has been a big increase in the use of telephone, video and email to check up on people. There has also been a big increase in what is called patient-initiated follow-up appointments or PIFU. It is down to the patient to contact the hospital if they think they need medical help. 

Within the NHS there is now agreement that a “large proportion of patients can be managed without setting foot in a physical clinic”.

Fosen conflict

The Fosen conflict is an ongoing Norwegian conflict regarding environmentalism on the Fosen peninsula, Trøndelag county. The Supreme Court ruled that wind turbines (on Fosen) have been built unlawfully. The Supreme Court ruled in October 2021 that the wind turbines (on Fosen), violate the indigenous rights of the Sámi people. The Fosen conflict has resulted in civil disobedience; in 2023, Greta Thunberg and others were blocking entrances to (government) ministries in Oslo; the police moved them out of the way. On March 2, 2023, protesters were blocking entrances to (government) ministries in Oslo; protesters were arrested, brought to ["the central arrest (facility)"] "sentralarresten" and given a fine. On Svalbard, students at the folk high school protested the visit of the prime minister; and walls at the school, were covered with protests [or messages of protest]. In the afternoon, the president of the Sami Parliament (Norway) and the Minister of Energy had a meeting; they held a press conference, following the meeting; the minister said that he apologised on behalf of the Cabinet (Norway) - for the violation of human rights, that had happened, in regard to [the decisions resulting from the case work,] "konsesjonsvedtakene". The same afternoon, the prime minister wrote that today the Cabinet is apologising to the Sami practitioners (at Fosen) of reindeer husbandry ("reindriftsamene") , for the violations of their human rights, because of the significant negative impact on those practitioners' opportunities to practice their culture. In the evening, the prime minister met (in a church), with some of the young[er] protesters. Later that evening, the spokeswoman for the protesters that attended that meeting, said that there are "demands of ours" that must be fulfilled immediately; furthermore, a final decision has to be made, and "our demand" is that the wind turbines (at Fosen) be dismantled, and the [use of] the land, returned to the Sami at Fosen, she said. The prime minister invited the Sami practitioners (at Fosen) of reindeer husbandry, for a breakfast (on 3 March); practitioners (from Fosen) and the prime minister and a few other politicians had a breakfast meeting (at "Statsministerens kontor"). Around 15 minutes after the end of the breakfast meeting, one of the leading protesters, called off the 8-day long protest; however, [a few hundred people,] activists [and supporters] gathered at "royal palace's square" for a sit-down protest that lasted a few hours.

The police have filed reports against 32 protesters; Fines have not been set (as of March 8, 2023).

Activists started (June 26) blocking roads to wind turbines at Roan, Åfjord municipality; 4 activists were told (June 29) by police to go away; 2 of those were removed by the police.

In October, the lawyer for the reindeer owners at North Fosen, said that his side will meet with a mediator and the government, in November; that lawyer (for the reindeer owners at North Fosen) says that there will be no more mediation after that meeting. (Earliere in the month, media said that there are no longer consultations going on between the "Sami of Fosen" ("Fosen-samene") and the Cabinet (Norway) and the Sami parliament (Norway).)

The "minister of oil and energy" said (2023's fourth quarter) that taking down all the wind turbines at Fosen, is not going to happen, for now.

On 22 November, media said the activists that did not follow orders from the police (on the night of February 27), now are being fined. The amount of money, in regard to each person's fine, is Norwegian kroner 5,000.

Apus (bird)

Apus is a genus of birds in the family Apodidae. They are called swifts in English. Not all swifts are in genus "Apus", but all birds in "Apus" are swifts.

Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli made the genus "Apus" in 1777. He did it by looking at tautonymy and the common swift. Carl Linnaeus named the common swift "Hirundo apus" in 1758. The name "Apus" is Latin for a swift. The word is from Ancient Greek : α, "a", "without," and πούς, "pous", "foot." People thought they were swallows without feet.

Before the 1950s, scientists disagreed about which animals should have the name "Apus". In 1801, Bosc gave the small crustacean animals that we call "Triops" today the genus name "Apus," and later writers continued to use it for them. In 1909, Keilhack said this was incorrect because there was already a group of birds called "Apus". It was not until 1958 that the scientists in the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) decided to use the name for only birds.

The genus has 20 species:


Some birds in "Apus" are dead. Scientists learned about them from fossils, marks that their bones left in rocks:

Scientists say the bird ""Apus" ignotus" is really in "Procypseloides".

From the west side, the building appears to be single-storied, but it is assumed to be double-storied from the east side. The rooms were directly raised from the archway from the lake. There's a hammam on the west side of the building that gets its water from an octagonal reservoir.

The complex has a small family mosque on the north, and at its backside, there's an open room connected to an octagonal tower, which was possibly used for contemplation. This tower balanced the complex. The palace is engraved and plastered with Mughal architecture.

Taxation in the Republic of Ireland

Taxation in the Republic of Ireland is very progressive. The top 10% of earners pay 60% of the taxes.

As well as income tax on earnings there is the Universal Social Charge and Pay Related Social Insurance.

Value added tax is charged on almost all goods and services.

Corporation tax is very important in Ireland and foreign multinationals pay about 80% of it. It is only 12.5% - much lower than most developed countries so many of the biggest American technology and pharmaceutical companies keep the money from intellectual property rights in their Irish subsidiaries. This makes the Irish economy seem much bigger than it really is.

Economy-of-effort theory

The economy-of-effort theory is an idea in the study of humans and the study of men, women, and sometimes a third or fourth type of person. Scholars use it to say why some groups of people give some work to women and other work to men. In an economy-of-effort scenario, work goes to men or women (or some other gender role recognized by that culture) not because of differences in men's and women's bodies but because other things about that culture make it easier.

Ember et al. say that if one group has men cut down trees and use wood, they will learn about wood and what it can do. That group might also have men make wooden musical instruments because their other work makes it easier for them to do that.

Anthropologists use this idea to explain why some work goes to men or women when other theories, for example male expendability, strength, or compatibility with childcare, cannot.


Government of Ireland

The Constitution of Ireland gives authority to a government which is headed by the Taoiseach, the head of government. The government is made up of ministers, each of whom must be a member of the Oireachtas, which consists of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.

The government is dependent on the Oireachtas to pass laws and so it needs a majority in the Dáil for budgets and government bills to pass.

The government runs the public administration in Ireland. In 2022 there were about 372,000 people working for it.

Ogedengbe of Ilesa

Ogedengbe of Ilesa (1822-1910), also known as Ogedengbe Agbogun Gboro was a Yoruba chief and fighter in Yorubaland, part of present-day Nigeria, who served as the Seriki (head warrior) during the Kiriji War (1877-1893) against Ibadan.

Dealignment

Dealignement, in political science, is where people dealigne from their former poitical interests.

Armory Show

The Armory Show was an art exhibition in 1913 in 69th Regiment Armory, New York. It lasted from February 17 until March 15, 1913.

Primary care

Primary care is the sort of healthcare people can use without having to be checked by someone first. It is generally not in hospitals. 

In most countries this means general practitioners, dentists, opticians and pharmacists. Emergency departments dont expect people to be checked out first. Physician assistants, physical therapists, or a nurse may expect people to be sent to them by a doctor in some places. If people are paying for their own treatment they may be able to go where they want, but in a public healthcare system there are usually more controls. In less developed countries people may be used to going to hospitals for all their problems.

Silent reading

Silent reading means reading without saying the words out loud.

Long ago, people didn't have spaces between words in their writing, so it was unusual to read silently.

Some people think silent reading can cause problems with thinking, but many schools still encourage it.
Reading out loud uses more parts of the brain because it involves speaking and reading at the same time.

The Metamorphosis

"The Metamorphosis" is a short story by Franz Kafka. It is about a young man named Gregor who wakes up from a nightmare and becomes an insect. Gregor becomes more and more like a bug and less and less like a human, and then he dies.

The story was first published as "Die Verwandlung" in 1915. The original German version is only 70 pages long. It is the longest work of fiction that Kafka thought was complete that was published during his lifetime. Several movies were made from the story. It was also turned into an opera.

Harlan Hubbard

Harlan Hubbard (January 4, 1900 – January 16, 1988) was an American artist and writer.

Hubbard was born in Bellevue, Kentucky, on January 4, 1900, across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, Ohio. His father died in 1907. In 1915, he and his mother went to New York City to live with two older brothers. He went to school at Childs High School in the Bronx. Then he studied art at the New York National Academy of Design. Later he went to the Art Academy of Cincinnati. 

Hubbard's wife, Anna Eikenhout, was born in Michigan on September 7, 1902. She was a musician who played the piano and cello. She read in three languages other than English. She taught college for a while, but moved to Cincinnati to work in the fine arts department at the public library. She met Hubbard there. 

They married in 1943 and lived for a short time in Fort Thomas, Kentucky. They lived for a while in a shack beside the river. Then, in 1944, they decided to live in a shanty boat (a small houseboat) and travel on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to New Orleans. They spent about five years doing this.

At New Orleans they sold their boat and bought a car. They drove for the next ten months to see much of the American West. Then they went back to Kentucky in 1951 and bought seven acres of land in what was called Payne Hollow, across the Ohio River from Hanover and Madison, Indiana.

The Hubbard's built a small house at Payne Hollow and lived there for the rest of their lives. They lived a very simple life that was not modern. They "grew their own food, made their own furniture (except for a grand piano that Anna played each evening), and lived without electricity or running water."

Harlan Hubbbard died of cancer in 1988 at age 88, about two years after his wife Anna.



Physician assistant

A physician assistant or is a healthcare worker who is not a qualified physician but practices medicine under supervision. The title used and what exactly they can do is different in different countries. 

They started in the USA in the 1960s, but there were similar jobs during World War II. There are now similar jobs in many countries as there is a general shortage of physicians. The training for these assistant posts is much shorter. 

Health in the Republic of Ireland

Rates of smoking, alcohol consumption and obesity are all high in Ireland. Heart disease, cancer and stroke are the most common causes of death. 

Life expectancy has improved since the year 1990.

The Lancet in September 2018 published a measure of expected human capital calculated for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016. Ireland had the sixteenth highest level of expected human capital.

Joss paper

Joss paper is a type of paper that is burned as an offering during Chinese ancestral worship and in the worship of deities in Chinese folk religion. People believe it helps the dead get what they need in the afterlife. In Taiwan people spent US$400 million on Joss paper in 2014.

Different types of spirit money are given to distinct types of spirits. There are three main types of joss paper: cash (also known as copper), silver, and gold. Cash paper is given to newly deceased and unknown spirits. Golden joss paper is offered to deities such as the Jade Emperor. Silver joss paper is given only to ancestral spirits and other spirits. It is important to follow these distinctions. If you burn the wrong paper, it may confuse spirits or insult them.



Welnos

Welnos is an Indo European deity linked to cattle, and there are similar gods in many mythologies such as Slavic, Lithuanian, Latvian, Norse, and Old English. This deity was reconstructed from the Slavic god Veles, Lithuanian god Velnias, and Latvian god Velns, who all protected flocks. The name of this god is also similar to Old Norse Ullr and Old English Wuldor.

Scholar Jaan Puhvel thought Welnos is also connected to the Elysian fields in Greek myth and ritual.

Some scholars, such as Max Muller, believed that Welnos, was related to Sanskrit Varuna and Greek Ouranos. However, this theory has been rejected because of language reasons, and the origin of the word is no longer accepted..

Welnos may have been a kind sky father who represented the night while Dyēus represented the day and danger. He might have had a competition with Perkwunos like Perun and Veles.

List of Proto Indo European deities

There are many reconstructed Indo European deities. Here is a list of some. These gods may have never existed. Some believe they did exist based on language history.


Doug Hopkins

Douglas Owen Hopkins (April 11, 1961 – December 5, 1993) was an American musician and songwriter. He was a member of the rock band Gin Blossoms. He was the band's lead guitarist and main songwriter. His writing credits included the singles "Hey Jealousy", "Found Out About You" and "Lost Horizons". Hopkins was born in Seattle, Washington. He grew up in Tempe, Arizona.

Hopkins, aged 32, died by suicide on December 5, 1993, in Tempe. He shot himself in the mouth with a .38 caliber pistol. He had chronic depression and was an alcoholic.

Jadunath Sarkar

Sir Jadunath Sarkar CIE, FRAS (10 December 1870 – 19 May 1958) was an Indian historian known for his expertise on the Mughal dynasty. He received his education in English literature and initially worked as a teacher before shifting his focus to historical research and writing. He had a deep understanding of the Persian language and wrote all of his books in English. Sarkar served as the Vice Chancellor of the University of Calcutta from 1926-1928 and was also a member of the Bengal Legislative Council from 1929-1932. He was knighted by the British government in 1929.

Sarkar was born in Karachmaria village in Natore, Bengal, and graduated in English from Presidency College, Calcutta in 1891. He went on to top the Master of Arts examination in English at Calcutta University in 1892 and received the Premchand-Roychand Scholarship in 1897. Sarkar began his teaching career as a faculty member of English literature at Ripon College, Calcutta in 1893, and was later appointed at Presidency College, Calcutta in 1898. He taught modern Indian history at Benaras Hindu University from 1917-1919 and both English and history at Ravenshaw College, Cuttack from 1919-1923. Sarkar was appointed as the Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University in 1926 and later joined Madras University as the Sir W. Meyer Lecturer in 1928.

Sarkar's work on the Mughal dynasty was highly regarded in his time, but later faded from public memory with the emergence of Marxist and postcolonial schools of historiography. Academically, his work has been compared to that of the Aligarh historians, who focused on the mansabdari system and gunpowder technology in the Mughal Empire. Sarkar, on the other hand, concentrated on military tactics and sieges.

Sarkar was honored by the British government with a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) and was knighted in the 1929 Birthday Honours list. A research center, the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta, has been established in his house and includes the Jadunath Bhavan Museum and Resource Centre, a museum-cum-archive of primary sources.

Published works by Sarkar include:


Deh₂nu

Deh₂nu- is a Proto-Indo-European goddess of rivers. Some people think that this is based on the Vedic goddess Dānu, the Irish goddess Danu, the Welsh goddess Don, and the names of some rivers such as the Danube, Don, Dnieper, and Dniester. But, Mallory and Adams say that there is no proof for a specific river goddess in this mythology, only the idea of rivers being important in Indic tradition.

Some people have suggested a sea god named *Trih₂tōn based on the Greek god Triton and the Old Irish word trïath, which means "sea". Mallory and Adams do not think this is true because there is only a small possibility that the words are related, and there is no evidence of a similar god in Irish mythology.

The goddess is also linked to Ossetian Donbettyr, who is said to give "three scones with honey" to those who turn their waterwheels. Donnán of Eigg might be a Christianized version of this deity. 

Some stories say that the goddess fought a hero named H2nert, and her possible descendants include Nart from the Nart saga, Indra, and Njord.

There’s a central Asian river called Dan. Its name might come from Dehnu

Swagger (software)

Swagger is a suite of tools for API developers from SmartBear Software and a former specification upon which the OpenAPI Specification is based.

The Swagger API project was created in 2011 by Tony Tam, technical co-founder of the dictionary site Wordnik. During the development of Wordnik's products, the need for automation of API documentation and client SDK generation became a major source of frustration. Tam designed a simple JSON representation of the API, building upon the flexibility of part of the REST style of architecture and using Swagger quickly gained popularity among API developers due to its ability to generate interactive documentation, client libraries, and server stubs automatically from API specifications. In 2015, the Swagger project was acquired by SmartBear Software, a company that specializes in software quality tools and API testing. SmartBear continues to develop and support Swagger and the OpenAPI Specification, which has become the industry standard for defining RESTful APIs.

Swagger provides a suite of tools for designing, building, documenting, and testing RESTful APIs. Some of its key features include:

Carlisle Indian Industrial School

The Carlisle Indian Industrial School (or Carlisle Indian School) was a boarding school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. It operated between 1879 and 1918. It was located in the old barracks. It was there to educate Native American children (which were called "Indians" at the time). The problem with these schools was that the children were told what America was like, but they were not told, what their people were like. This process was called assimilation, and was done on purpose. It means that some of the cultural values were lost.

With the beginning of the first World War, the school was closed, and the property again was used by the military. Today, all of it is part of the United States Army War College.

Freddy's Frozen Custard &amp; Steakburgers

The company was founded in Wichita, Kansas in 2002. Almost two years after that they opened their first franchise in Hutchinson. In 2011, Freddy's opened their 50th store in California.

The company was named for Frederick "Freddy" Simon (1924 or 1925 -- 2020).

2023 Ohio train accident

On February 3, 2023, a train accident happened in East Palestine, Ohio, at 8.55pm EST (). A train carrying dangerous chemicals derailed. Several of the 38 railcars caught fire, and started to burn. Some burned for more than two days. Emergency crews burned several of them in a controlled fire. This fire released hydrogen chloride and phosgene into the air. Phosgene is used only in specially equipped plants. Today, it is used to produce certain plastics, and other chemicals, such as dyes. In the past, it was also used as a chemical weapon. For this reason, the residents within a radius were evacuated. Emergency response was started from agencies in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. East Palestine is about half way between Cleveland and Pittsburgh.

The derailed train was running from Madison, Illinois to Conway, Pennsylvania, on the Fort Wayne Line. Aboard the train were an engineer, conductor, and conductor trainee. The train consisted of 141 loaded cars and 9 empty ones. Other reports say there was one more car, for a total of 151 cars, weighing 18,000 tons.

Of those cars, 20 were carrying dangrous materials, including chloroethene (vinyl chloride), butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, isobutylene, flammable liquids, and benzene residue. The train left Madison on February 1, and had had at least one mechanical failure before the derailment.

Security footage from a business in Salem, Ohio ( northwest from East Palestine), and a Ring doorbell camera from New Waterford, Ohio ( northwest from East Palestine), show fire coming from underneath a rail car. After this, at around 8:55 pm EST on February 3, 2023, 51 cars derailed on the east side of town, near the border with Pennsylvania. 49 of the cars ended up in a derailment pile, which caught fire and burned for several days. Of the 51 derailed cars, 11 were tank cars which dumped 100,000 gallons of hazardous materials, including vinyl chloride, benzene residue, and butyl acrylate.

About 48 hours later, the NTSB released a first report that stated that the derailment was caused by a mechanical problem on one of the railcars' trucks. This may be connected to reports that an axle was observed throwing sparks about an hour before. The crew received an alarm from a wayside defect detector shortly before the derailment indicating a mechanical problem, and then an emergency brake application initiated.

Nearly 70 emergency agencies from Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania mobilized in response. East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway declared a state of emergency.

Norfolk Southern personnel were first to respond on February 3. On February 4, they noticed water spillage into Sulphur Run and Leslie Run, and installed barriers to separate the floating pollutant. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began monitoring air quality on February 3. They said humans can smell butyl acrylate at a concentration lower than the screening level (exposure limit). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit for butyl acrylate is time-weighted average 10 ppm (55 mg/m).

On February 5, the temperature changed in one of the train cars. This caused fears of an explosion with the potential to disperse shrapnel as the fires continued to burn. Although five cars containing vinyl chloride remained intact after the crash, the relief valve on one of the cars had malfunctioned. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine activated the Ohio National Guard to assist local authorities in what he called "a matter of life and death". Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro ordered an evacuation in areas of Beaver County which bordered the site. Officials in both states went door-to-door to evacuate residents. The fire from the accident burned until February 5.
Commentary following the derailment centered around industry working conditions and safety concerns, such as the lack of modern brake safety regulations, the implementation of precision scheduled railroading (PSR), had reduced railway workers per train, and increased train lengths and weight. Critics said that train companies had failed to invest in train maintenance to prevent accidents, even though they conduct stock buybacks, in which money that could be used on maintenance and safety measures is instead distributed to shareholders.

On February 14, Governor Mike DeWine told reporters that he was not seeing any problems in the area after the controlled release of chemicals and that President Joe Biden had offered federal assistance but DeWine said that no further assistance was necessary.

Joseph Cornell

Joseph Cornell (December 24, 1903 – December 29, 1972) was an American visual artist and film-maker. For his art, he did not paint or draw. He put together pictures and objects that he found. This kind of art is called "collage" and "assemblage." He often arranged things inside of wooden boxes that he made himself.

Cornell was born in Nyack, New York in 1903. He had two sisters. His younger brother Robert had cerebral palsy. After his father's death in 1917, the family moved to a house on Utopia Avenue in Bayside, Queens in New York City. He lived there from 1929 until he died in 1972. 

From 1917 to 1921, Cornell went to Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, but he did not graduate. After that, he worked as a salesman and, later, as a textile designer in New York. He walked around the city and found many things to collect in used bookstores and junk shops.

In the 1930s he started making movies out of parts of other old movies. These and his collages and boxes were influenced by surrealism, an art and literature movement that made things that felt strange, like dreams.

His first public show was in "Surréalisme" at the Julien Levy Gallery in 1932, along with art by Salvador Dali and Marcel Duchamp.

Cornell died of a heart attack at home in 1972, a few years after the deaths of his mother and brother.



OpenAPI Specification

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is an open standard for describing and defining RESTful APIs. It was previously called the Swagger Specification and is currently maintained by the OpenAPI Initiative, which is a group of industry experts and companies.

The OAS is a machine-readable format that enables developers to outline the details of an API in a structured and standardized way. This includes information about the endpoints, operations, parameters, responses, and other relevant data. This uniformity makes it easier for developers to understand, use, and test APIs, as well as for tools to generate documentation, client libraries, and server stubs automatically from the specification.

The OAS supports both JSON and YAML formats and has become a popular tool in the API development community.

The Swagger Specification was created in 2010 by Tony Tam, technical co-founder of the dictionary site Wordnik. During the development of Wordnik's products, the need for automation of API documentation and client SDK generation became a major source of frustration. Tam designed a simple JSON representation of the API, building upon the flexibility of part of the REST style of architecture, and Swagger quickly gained popularity among API developers due to its ability to generate interactive documentation, client libraries, and server stubs automatically from API specifications. 

In 2015, the Swagger Specification was donated to the newly formed OpenAPI Initiative, which is a consortium of industry experts and companies who are dedicated to the development of the standard.

The OAS provides a variety of features that make it easier to design, build, document, and test RESTful APIs. These include:

Mommie Dearest (movie)

Mommie Dearest is a 1981 American biographical psychological drama movie directed by Frank Perry and starring Faye Dunaway, Steve Forrest, Mara Hobel, Diana Scarwid and Xander Berkeley. The movie shows Christina Crawford's adoptive mother, Hollywood actress Joan Crawford, as an abusive, controlling and manipulative mother. Christina and her brother Christopher are suffering child abuse from their mother.

The movie was adapted for the screen by Robert Getchell, Tracy Hotchner, Frank Perry, and Frank Yablans from Christina's 1978 autobiography of the same name. The executive producers were Christina's husband, David Koontz, and Terry O'Neill, Dunaway's then-boyfriend and soon-to-be husband. The movie was distributed by Paramount Pictures, the only one of the "Big Eight" movie studios for which Crawford had never appeared in a movie.

The movie was not considered successful at the box office, making just over $19 million in North America from a $10 million budget. Despite receiving mostly negative reviews from movie critics, the movie's melodramatic script and Faye Dunaway's acting, made it a cult movie and an "unintentional comedy". It is often considered one of the worst movies ever made. It was nominated for nine Golden Raspberry Awards (Razzies) at the 2nd Golden Raspberry Awards, and won five, including "Worst Picture" and "Worst Actress" for Faye Dunaway.

The bridge is a landmark of Tromsø and is protected against modifications. In 2005, the fencing was raised to prevent suicide. 

Arctic Cathedral

The Arctic Cathedral, also known as Tromsdalen Church, is a church in Tromsø Municipality in Norway. It is a part of the Tromsøysund parish and is managed by the Tromsø domprosti, which is responsible for a group of churches in the area. The church is also under the authority of the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland.

The church was built in a long church style in 1965 using plans drawn up by architect Jan Inge Hovig. The church is made mainly of concrete and metal, and it has a seating capacity of approximately 600 people. The church was built by Ing. F. Selmer A/S Tromsø as the main contractor for the construction.

Despite being nicknamed the Ishavskatedralen or "The Cathedral of the Arctic Sea", it is important to note that the church is not a cathedral, but a parish church.

The church is notable for its design and is one of the most notable churches in Tromsø. Tromsø has other notable churches, including the Protestant Tromsø Cathedral, which is the only wooden cathedral in Norway, and the Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady, Tromsø.

The church was consecrated on 19 November 1965 by Bishop Monrad Norderval. The church is made out of cast-in-place aluminum-coated concrete panels and has a glass mosaic on the eastern side, made by Victor Sparre in 1972. The church acquired a new organ built by Grönlunds Orgelbyggeri in 2005 to replace the old organ delivered by Vestlandske Orgelverksted, Hareid in 1965.

Tromsdalstinden

Tromsdalstinden is a mountain in Tromsø Municipality in Norway, with an elevation of 1,238 meters. The mountain is located at the southern end of the Tromsdalen valley, just southeast of the city of Tromsø. The Norwegian name Tromsdalstinden means "the peak above Tromsdalen," while the Sámi name is made up from the parts Sálaš and Oaivi, with the first word meaning a good hunting area, and the second meaning a rounded mountain without jagged peaks.

The mountain is a popular hiking destination and can be summited from the suburb Tromsdalen or from Ramfjorden. The slopes up are not technically difficult, though fog and rain can make the ascent complicated for those not familiar with the terrain. Skiers usually take the Fjellheisen aerial tramway to Mount Storsteinen and begin their ascent from there.

In 2003, plans to build an alpine skiing facility on the slopes of Tromsdalstinden for the 2014 Winter Olympics were proposed. However, this sparked immediate protests from some Sámi activists who claimed that Tromsdalstinden has been a Sámi sacred mountain since ancient times. The Sami Parliament enacted a resolution declaring it a holy mountain in 2004, and the plans were discontinued.

While some argue that Tromsdalstinden was made a holy mountain in recent times as part of Sámi identity politics, others believe that it has been sacred at one point before Christianization. The mountain bears the significant feature of a traditional sacred mountain, dominating the landscape due to its shape and/or height. Although the classic Sámi religion is dead, the mountain remains of cultural significance to modern Sámi, and their commitment to preserving it displays its intense cultural significance to their ancestors.

French alphabet

The French alphabet uses the same letters as the ISO basic Latin alphabet as well as the English alphabet, although its pronunciation is different from that of English. Some letters sometimes also have diacritics on them (e.g. Français), but letters with diacritics are considered to be a modified form of the letters without diacritics, so they are not different letters of the alphabet. The letters "k" and "w" do not appear in original French words, only in words borrowed from other languages (e.g. kangourou, wagon).

YAML

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format that is commonly used for configuration files and data exchange between programming languages. It is often used in conjunction with web development frameworks and other systems that need to share data.

YAML was first released in 2001 by Ingy döt Net, Brian Ingerson, and Oren Ben-Kiki. It was designed to be a more user-friendly alternative to other markup languages like XML and JSON. YAML's syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, using whitespace and indentation to organize data.

YAML is often used for configuration files, such as those used by web development frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Django. It is also commonly used for data exchange between programming languages, especially in systems that use different programming languages for different components.

One of the key features of YAML is that it is designed to be easy for humans to read and write, while still being machine-readable. This makes it a popular choice for configuration files, as it allows developers to easily modify settings without needing to understand complex markup languages.

YAML is a superset of JSON, meaning that any valid JSON document is also a valid YAML document. However, YAML adds additional features, such as support for comments, anchors and aliases, and complex data types like maps and lists.

YAML has been implemented in many programming languages, including Python, Ruby, Java, and Perl. It is also supported by many text editors and IDEs, which can provide syntax highlighting and other features to make working with YAML easier.

Overall, YAML is a flexible and user-friendly data serialization format that is widely used in web development, system configuration, and other areas where data needs to be exchanged between different components.

YAML's syntax is designed to be simple and easy to read. It uses indentation and whitespace to organize data, rather than relying on explicit tags or markup. Here is an example of a YAML document:
name: John Smith
age: 35
In this example, the document contains three key-value pairs, where the keys are `name`, `age`, and `email`, and the values are `John Smith`, `35` , respectively.
- name: John Smith
- name: Jane Doe

YAML also supports more complex data structures, like maps and lists. Here is an example of a YAML document that contains a map and a list:

Platymantis negrosensis

The Negros forest frog ("Platymantis negrosensis") is a frog. It lives in the Philippines on Negros and Panay Islands. People have seen it between 200 and 1800 meters above sea level.

This frog is about 30-50 mm long from nose to rear end. It has large disks on its toes for cimbing trees.

This frog moves around at night. It climbs trees. The female frog lays eggs in fern plants that grow on trees. The eggs hatch into small froglets. They are never tadpoles.

This frog is in danger because human beings change the places where it lives. Humans cut down trees in forests to get wood to build with. Humans let animals eat grass where the frog lives.

Anti-environmentalism

Anti-environmentalism is a political ideology where protecting the environment is not seen as necessary. Anti-environmentalists don't like strict rules that protect nature and say the Earth can take care of itself without humans getting involved. They don't like environmental groups and try to stop them from influencing politicians.

Hut (dwelling)

A hut is a simple shelter that is built by humans. A hut is small, and most of the time, it is less well-built than a house, but is more complex than a tent. Some indigenous peoples use huts as their permanent place of safety. A hut can be built out of many things, such as wood, grass, or fabric.

The word is, many times, used by people who think homes that are uncommon in their country are primitive. Sometimes, the word "house" is used to avoid this. Often, how the hut looks is based off of tradition. The design of the hut in tropical and sub-tropical areas is meant to allow air to come inside, reducing the heat inside of the hut. Also, instead of being called a shed, something can be called a hut. The word has also been used to speak about structures that shelter climbers and backpackers. The word comes from the 1650s, from French "hutte".

Huts are used by shepherds when they are moving animals from one grassland to another. 
They are also used by people who are traveling in rural areas.
Some populations use huts during a diaspora, such as those on farms in the Amazon jungle.
Huts have been built to keep items safe, to build items, and to teach when regular classrooms cannot be used.

Many huts are planned to be built quick, and with a small amount of work. These huts only need a bit of understanding of architecture to be built, and do not need special tools.

Sometimes, the word "hut" is used in the names of stores, to imply that it is a small place, and that it is friendly. Some stores that use the word in their name are Pizza Hut and Sunglass Hut. Buildings that sell things in a park or beach can look like huts.

Cultural diffusion

Culture diffusion refers to the spread of cultural traits or patterns from one society or group of people to another. This process can occur through various means, such as migration, trade, communication, or technological advancements.

For example, the diffusion of Buddhism from India to other parts of Asia is an example of cultural diffusion. Another example could be the spread of American fast food chains, such as McDonald's, to different parts of the world, where they have adapted their menus to local tastes.

Cultural diffusion can lead to the blending of different cultures and the creation of new cultural forms, such as creole languages or fusion cuisine. However, it can also result in the loss of traditional cultural practices and the homogenization of global cultures.

Atropa

Atropa is a genus of flowering plants, in the nightshade family. They are herbaceous perennials, with large leaves, and shiny berries. These berries are particularly dangerous to children, because they look like cherries, but they are highly poisonous. Atropa species prefer temperate climates and alkaline soils. They often grow in light shade in woodlands near limestone hills and mountains. Their seeds can remain viable in the soil for long periods, germinating when the soil of sites in which plants once grew (but from which plants have long been absent) is disturbed by human activity or by natural causes, e.g. the windthrow of trees. The best-known member of the genus Atropa is deadly nightshade ("A. belladonna") - the poisonous plant "par excellence" in the minds of many. Atropa species contain chemicals that are used in medicine, such as atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine. These are all tropane alkaloids that have anticholinergic, deliriant, antispasmodic and mydriatic properties. The genus is named for Άτροπος ("Atropos") - lit. 'she who may not be turned (aside)' - one of the Three Fates and cutter of the thread of life / bringer of death. They are named after her because of the extreme toxicity of "A. belladonna" and its fellow species.

In some older classifications, the mandrake ("Mandragora officinarum") has been placed in the genus "Atropa", with the scientific name "Atropa mandragora".

John Martyn

Iain David McGeachy (11 September 1948 – 29 January 2009) was a Scottish singer, guitar player and songwriter. His stage name was John Martyn. He made music for over 40 years. He made 23 studio albums. Most of his music was folk rock and blues.

Martyn started making music when he was 17. He was in the Scottish folk music community. His music was inspired by English folk music and American blues. He joined Island Records and started making albums. He started to make his music sound similar to jazz and rock. His most popular albums were "Bless the Weather" (1971), "Solid Air" (1973) and "One World" (1977). He made music with other people, such as Phil Collins. He kept making music until he died in 2009.

Martyn became a musician when he was 17. He played a mix of folk music and blues. This made him an important person in the British folk music community in the 1960s. In 1967, he joined Island Records, a record label. He released an album named "London Conversation" in 1967. One year later, he released "The Tumbler".

Martyn had a special way of playing the guitar. He played the acoustic guitar, but used many effect pedals with it. This made the guitar sound different. The first time he played the guitar in this way was on "Stormbringer!" in 1970. He made this album with his wife, Beverley Martyn. He made two albums with his wife. The second is named "The" "Road to Ruin".

In February 1973, Martyn released "Solid Air". The song "Solid Air" was made for singer Nick Drake. The album sold many copies. In 2009, a new version of "Solid Air" was made. It had more songs on it. A few months later, he made "Inside Out". This album was about improvised music. Later, he made more music. He visited Jamaica, and met Lee Perry. Perry was a music producer, and worked with Martyn to make new music.

In 1977, he released "One World". Many musicians helped Martyn make the album, such as Rico and Steve Winwood. Lee Perry helped him make the song "Big Muff". The album was influenced by dub music because of Perry. In 1978, he played guitar on "Harmony of the Spheres" by Neil Ardley.

At the end of the 1970s, Martyn's marriage got worse. Some say that this was because he was addicted to drugs and was an alcoholic. Beverly said that John hurt her. Martyn said this was a "very dark" time in his life. Because of this, he made the album "Grace and Danger". Phil Collins played the drums on the album. It was released in October 1980. Chris Blackwell, the owner of Island Records, did not want to release the album. This was because he was a good friend of Martyn and Beverley. He thought the album was too sad to release. Martyn wanted him to release the album, so he did. In the late 1980s, Martyn said "Grace and Danger" was his favorite album. It is one of his most popular albums.

In 1981, Martyn left Island Records. He joined WEA, another record label. He made two more albums: "Glorious Fool" and "Well Kept Secret". Both of these albums went into the top 30 on the UK Albums Chart. He left WEA after making the albums, and joined Island Records again. He made three albums with Island, and then left the record label again in 1988.

Martyn joined Permanent Records and made two albums. These were "The Apprentice" (1990) and "Cooltide" (1991). Phil Collins helped him make "No Little Boy" in 1993. This album had new versions of some of his older songs. In the late 1990s, Martyn started mixing his music with trip-hop. Some of his albums that had this type of music were "And" and "Glasgow Walker".

Martyn had to have his right leg amputated below the knee. This was because a cyst opened on his leg, and he got sepsis. In July 2006, BBC made a documentary named "Johnny Too Bad" about this time. The documentary was also about Martyn writing and making music for "On the Cobbles". This was an album that was released in 2004. The album had a more acoustic sound. 

On January 29, 2009, Martyn died in Thomastown, County Kilkenny, Ireland. He died because of acute respiratory distress syndrome. He had been living in Thomastown with his wife, Theresa Walsh. Martyn was put in the Order of the British Empire in 2009. Walsh accepted the award at Buckingham Palace for him. His last studio album, "Heaven and Earth", was finished in 2011.

The "Gotham City Sirens" were created by Paul Dini and Guillem March, first appearing in "Gotham City Sirens #1". (2009).

Dheghom

Dheghom (Proto-Indo-European: "*dʰéǵʰōm" or "*dʰǵʰōm"; 'earth'), or Plethwih (PIE: "*pleth₂wih₁", the 'Broad One'), is an Earth-goddess from Proto-Indo-European mythology.
She is often called Mother Earth ("*Dʰéǵʰōm Méh₂tēr"), and is called vast (*"pleth₂wih₁") and dark ("*dʰengwo-") . She represents the place where people and animals live.

She takes care of everything and everyone, like plants and animals. She is often thought of together with Dyēus, who is the god of the sky and where the other gods live. They are different but work together. Dyēus can make it rain which helps things grow and makes people happy. People who speak certain languages believe that the Mother Earth helps things grow and die. They think she is where people come from and where they go when they die.

The word for 'earth' in Proto-Indo-European is *dʰ(é)ǵʰōm. This word is found in many different languages that come from Proto-Indo-European. For example, it is in Albanian dhe and toka, Hittite tēkan and tagān, Sanskrit kṣám, Greek khthṓn, Latin humus, Avestan zam, Tocharian tkaṃ, Old Irish dú, Lithuanian žẽmė, and Old Slavonic zemlja. This is why it is considered to be one of the most certain words we know from Proto-Indo-European.. However, there isn't much proof from language that the name *Dheghom was used for rituals. In fact, she was also known by other names, such as *Pleth₂-wih₁ (the 'Broad One'). But these other names aren't found as much in the different languages that came from Proto-Indo-European.
If we can trust that the Earth-goddess in Proto-Indo-European was called Dheghom and that Plethwih was one of her nicknames, it's likely that people thought of her as the Earth as a god-like being, not just a goddess who ruled over the Earth. This is because Proto-Indo-European mythology was strongly influenced by animism, which means people believed that everything had a spirit or soul.

Murder of Victoria Climbié

Adjo Victoria Climbié (November 2, 1991 - February 25, 2000), better known as Anna Climbié or Victoria Climbié was born in Abobo near Abidjan in the Ivory Coast, and when she was aged seven she was sent by her parents to Europe with her great-aunt Marie Thérèse Kouao for a chance for an education. They travelled first to France, and then to England. In London, Kouao met bus-driver Carl Manning, and she and Victoria moved into his flat in Tottenham in July 1999. Here, Victoria was abused by both Kouao and Manning. She was admitted to casualty on February 24, 2000, unconscious and suffering from hypothermia; she died the next day. The Home Office pathologist noted 128 separate injuries and scars on her body. 

Marie Thérèse Kouao and Carl Manning were charged with child cruelty and murder. During police interviews, both claimed that Victoria was possessed. Their trial ran from November 2000 to January 12, 2001. Both were found guilty, and were sentenced to life imprisonment. 

Victoria's murder led to a public inquiry, chaired by Lord Herbert Laming, who investigated the role of social services, the NHS and police in her death. The Laming report found that on at least 12 occasions care workers could have saved her life. The highly critical report has lead to further reforms of the way child protection measures are implemented in the U.K., including the creation of a database to keep track of every child in Britain in order to better co-ordinate the notes of doctors and social workers.

Kingdom of Mutapa

The kingdom of Mutapa was a state that existed in Africa. It was made of parts of modern-day Zimbabwe, and the middle part of Mozambique. Probably it was most successful in the 13th to the 15th century. The Portugese were th e first to come to the southern parts of Africa. When they did, the kingdom had alreadysplit into smaller parts. As the people didn't use writing, most of what is known is from ruins, and archeological sites. Great Zimbabwe is probably the best known of these. Other than that, there are many oral traditions about its rulers. 

How the kingdom was organized in detail is unclear. The oral traditions that are there, tell that there was a great focus on the king, as a person. This points to some king of absolutism. Likely, the king was sacred, and seen as god. This is typical for early African states, and can also be observed elsewhere in the region. 

They used canals for irrigation. These canals are open ditches alongside the mountain hills. There's a lot of engineering which keeps the water flowing. Both of these point to a society which was higlhly organised, and able recruit many workers, in a short time. 

The kingdom likely had two periods: in the first, Great Zimbabwe was built, and was the center of economic activity. In a second period, there were other centers as well. 

Philip V of France

Philip V (French: "Philippe V"; 1293 — 3 January 1322) nicknamed the Tall (French: "le Long") was the King of France from 1316 until his death in 1322. He was also the King of Navarre (as Philip II) from 1314 until his death in 1322, and also the Regent of France during the interregnum between the death of his older brother Louis X and the birth of Louis' posthumous son, John I and also during the reign of the short-lived king.

Philip was the second son of King Philip IV of France and Queen Joan I of Navarre. As the second son, he never expected to become king. He was granted an appanage, the County of Poitiers, while his elder brother, Louis, inherited the French and Navarrese thrones. However, when Louis inherited the French throne after his father's death in 1314, Louis gave the Navarrese throne to Philip and he became the King of Navarre as Philip II. When Louis died two years later in 1316, he left a daughter, Joan and a pregnant wife, Clementia of Hungary. Philip successfully claimed the regency. Clementia gave birth to a boy John who was immediately proclaimed after his birth king as John I, but the infant king lived only for five days.

After the death of his nephew, Philip immediately had himself crowned at Reims. However, his legitimacy was challenged by the party of Louis X's daughter Joan. Philip successfully contested her claims for a number of reasons, including her youth, doubts regarding her paternity (her mother was involved in the Tour de Nesle Affair), and the Estates General's determination that women should be excluded from the line of succession to the French throne. The succession of Philip, instead of Joan, set the precedent for the French royal succession that would be known as the Salic law.

Philip restored good relations with the County of Flanders, which had entered into open rebellion during his father's rule, but simultaneously his relations with his brother-in-law Edward II of England worsened as Edward, who was also the Duke of Guyenne, refused to swear homage to him. A spontaneous popular crusade started in Normandy in 1320 aiming to liberate the Iberian Peninsula from the Moors. Instead the angry populace marched to the south attacking castles, royal officials, priests, lepers, and Jews. Philip engaged in a series of domestic reforms intended to improve the management of the kingdom. These reforms included the creation of an independent Court of Finances, the standardization of weights and measures, and the establishment of a single currency.

In 1307 Philip married Joan II, Countess of Burgundy, with whom he had four daughters. The couple however, produced no male heirs, therefore, when Philip died from dysentery in 1322, he was succeeded by his younger brother Charles IV.

Philip as seen as one of France's greatest kings. Like his predecessors, he established a system of local militias under officers responsible to the crown. He also increased the efficiency of government machinery at all levels and checked the abuses of local officials. He also stabilized the country and kept France in peace.

Listicle

When talking about journalism, a listicle in an article that is published as a list. The titles of such articles will usually contain a number, and often a superlative: "The 10 most important things...", "The 30 best places..." are examples of such titles. The article will then give this numbered list, and often also an explanation, for each item. Many of these listicles are presented in a count-down order, so that the best item is at the end. This also implies a ranking. Other listicles give no ranking directly, and simply discuss the items, perhaps gropuing them by theme: "20 things to do in ..".The word is a portmanteau derived from "list" and "article." The word is similar to "popsicle". This stresses the fun but "not too nutritious" nature of the listicle.

Listicles also have the benefit that they can be produced more rapidly than in-depth articles or essays, which may require a lot of research. 

While conventional reportage and essay-writing often require the careful crafting of narrative flow, the building-block nature of the listicle lends itself to more rapid production. It can also be a means of "recycling" information, as often it is the context, not the content, that is original. For example, one can construct a listicle by adding captions to YouTube clips. For these reasons, the form has come under criticism as a "kind of cheap content-creation".
It's so easy you wonder why everyone doesn't do it until you realize that now it's all they do: Come up with an idea ("Top 10 Worst [X]") on the L train ride to the office that morning, [and] slap together 10 (or 25, or 100) cultural artifacts ripe for the kind of snarky working over that won't actually tax you at all as a writer/thinker.
The blogger and technologist Anil Dash has disparaged the proliferation of listicles, particularly within the blogosphere, characterizing them in 2006 as the "geek equivalents of Cosmo coverlines".

Nevertheless, the form remains a mainstay of the newsstand and of the web. The covers of magazines such as "Cosmopolitan" and "Men's Journal" regularly sport at least one, if not several listicles. Some websites, such as BuzzFeed, generate hundreds of listicles daily.

Alex Johnson, writing for "The Independent", suggested that an 1886 speech by Sir John Lubbock which gave a list of around 100 books "which on the whole are perhaps best worth reading" was an early form of listicle, and that Lubbock should be considered the 'godfather' of the format.

Steven Poole suggested that listicles have literary precursors like Jorge Luis Borges's "The Analytical Language of John Wilkins". He also compares it to more high-art versions like Umberto Eco's "The Infinity of Lists", a book composed entirely of lists.

In 2009, posts in the format "25 Random Things About Me" became an Internet meme, starting on Facebook but spreading to the broader web, and attracting considerable media coverage in the process.


Programming block

A programming block is the arrangement of television and radio programs so that similar types of programs will air in succession. TV channels and radio stations tend to do this with the hope that it will keep viewers interested and stay tuned to the station for a longer period of time rather than leave after just one show. This is quite popular in cable TV, where they can arrange reruns into blocks to fill daytime slots where there aren’t so many viewers watching. Some blocks have become so popular that they ended up getting their own channel.

Gopa (caste)

Gopa or Gop or Gope is a synonym of the Ahir (Yadav) caste found in India and Nepal. in the Mahabharata, Ahir, Gopa, Gopal and Yadavas are all synonyms. The Amarakośa mentions Gopa, Gopāla, Gosaṁkhya, Godhuk and Ballava as the synonyms for Abhira and says that the village or place where Abhiras lived is named as Ghosha or Abhirapalli. The modern Ahirs are the descendants of the Abhiras of ancient times. The Abhiras were the same as the Gopas or Ballavas of Mathura becomes evident from the fact that the Padma Purana relates that Vishnu informed the Abhiras: I shall be born amongst you, O Abhiras, at Mathura in my eighth birth.

The Yadavas of the Mahabharata period were known to be the followers of Vaishnavism, of which Krishna was the leader: they were Gopas (cowherd) by profession, but at the same time they held the status of the Kshatriyas, participating in the battle of Kurukshetra. The present Ahirs/Yadavs are also followers of Vaisnavism.
In Harivamsa Purana, it has been said that Gopas and Yadav are generic of same lineage and they are called Gop or Yadav.

According to Bhagavata Purana, The Gopas are re-incarnation of Devas. They are the messengers of Krishna, They are fond of Gavya or the products of Cows. The relation between Krishna and the Gopas is that between an object and its image.

In Rigveda, King Yadu (ancestor of the Yadavas) is mentioned as Gopa, here the term Gopa may have been used to refer to the king or chief of the tribe as Gopa or Gopati was also the epithet given to the king in that period.

Narayani Sena (Gopayan) or Yadav(Ahir) Sena, the army of Lord Krishna of Dwarka Kingdom is called as the supreme sena of all time. It is described in the Mahabharat as being all of the Abhira caste. They were the basic threat to the rival kingdoms. Fearing Narayani Sena, many kings do not tried fighting against Dwarka. Because Dwarka sorted most of the threats through Krishna's politics and talent of Yadavas. Using Narayani Sena, the Yadavas extended their empire to most of India.
Krishna had offered Arjuna, the choice of selection between him or his whole army of Narayani Sena against Duryodhana. He possessed 10 million fighting Gopas who were brave fighters and were famous by the name of Narayan. In Harivansa Purana, it has been said that Gopa or Yadav are generic of the same lineage.
Before the war started in the Kurukshetra battlefield in Mahabharat (one of the two major epics of ancient India), both sides – the Kauravas and the Pandavas started out in all directions to meet various kings to solicit support. Incidentally, both Duryodhana (from Kauravas side) and Arjuna (from Pandavas side) reached Dwarika, the kingdom of Shree Krishna together. Lord Krishna put forward a condition in front of both – you can have either me on your side or my entire army, the Yadav army – known as the Narayani Sena. He also told both that he wouldn't take to any arms during the entire war. So when Krishna first asked Arjun what he wanted, much to Duryodhana's delight, he opted for the Lord- 'Narayan' and Duryodhana got these great warriors of the strong army-the Narayani Sena. When Narayani Sena was fighting for Kauravas, only Kritavarma and his army unit fought for the Kauravas. Satyaki fought for the Pandavas. The rest of the Atirathas and Maharathis were withheld from the Kurukshetra war on the advice of Balram and Krishna.
These Gopas, whom Krishna had offered to Duryodhana to fight in his support when he himself joined Arjuna's side, were no other than the Yadavas themselves, who were also the Abhiras. They were the supporters of the Duryodhana and Kauravas, and in the Mahabharata, Abhir, Gopa, Gopal and Yadavas are all synonyms. They defeated the hero of Mahabharatha war (Arjuna), and spared him when he disclosed the identity of the members of the family of Sri Krishna.

Petroleum industry in Nigeria

Nigeria is one of the countries that manufactures oil and gas in Africa, the nation takes the second position based on the volume of production. There are two types of crude oil which is extracted from the Niger delta basin: the light, and heavy crude oil. The light crude oil equals 36 in weight while the heavier is about 20–25 in weight. Both the light and heavy crude oil have paraffin but they are low in sulfur. The wealth and financial plan of Nigeria have been improved upon through the income and revenues gotten from the petroleum industry since 1960. In February 2021, the statistics has shown that the Nigerian oil sector contributes to about 9% of the entire GDP of the nation. Nigeria is an African nation that mainly produces and exports oil and gas as well as other petroleum products to the United States of America. In 2010, Nigeria exported more than one million barrels per day to the United States, amounting to 9% of the total crude oil and petroleum products imported by the U.S. and more than 40% of exports by Nigeria.

The need for the improvement of the petroleum industry towards the provision of easy business environment, and encouragement of local contents results to the passing of the Petroleum Industry Bill into law by the Goodluck Jonathan administration on July 18, 2008.

Health in New Zealand

New Zealand is a high income country, and the population are generally healthy. The main health problems are obesity and heart disease. New Zealand was 7th among OECD countries for obesity in 2003, with 20.9% of the adult population having a body mass index of greater than 30.

Life expectancy rose steadily between 1960 and 2020. In 2022, the life expectancy of New Zealanders was 82.65 years.  Māori life expectancy was seven years less in 2000 and still 7 years less in 2023, but improved by 4 years between 2002 and 2022, just the same as the rest of the population. 

Data (computing)

Data is a sequence of numbers, words, or other symbols. Data needs to be explained to become information. Digital data is data stored using the binary system, and is 1s and 0s. In computer systems invented after 1960, all data is digital. Data can be transported over a network or in memory, be changed, or be stored and be inactive. Data moving inside of a computer moves in multiple of these binary digits, in multiple conductors. Data that comes from a system that detects temperature is often analog and needs to become many binary digits, instead. Data that is used for numbers, characters, or symbols is stored using various magnets, a disc, electronics, or mechanically. Data goes into and out of various other devices attached to the computer. Memory elements often use a hexadecimal address, and 1 byte of storage. Data is, many times, stored in databases. A visual, such as a graph, can be created out of data.

Data can be metadata, or data that is about other data. It can be suggested, or it can be given. Data relating to actual events usually has the time recorded as metadata. Computers follow commands given to them as data, and those commands are called programs. A program is a list of commands that control the computer, and which it does. When the program is acted on by the computer, it consists of code. The storage used by the program, but not acted on by the central processing unit (CPU) are data. A single datum is a value stored inside of the computer. Files containing only binary are sometimes called data, so as to point out the difference between these files and readable text. The amount of digital data was guessed to be 281 exabytes in 2008.

Dentistry in the United Kingdom

Dentistry in the United Kingdom is partly a free part of the National Health Service and partly paid for privately. Most dentists run private businesses. UK dentists are regulated by the General Dental Council  and the Care Quality Commission. If they do NHS work they are paid for activity. There are contracts which sets down what they will be paid for and how much. They are different in the different part of the United Kingdom.

Before the NHS started in 1948 many people paid to have their teeth taken out because they were afraid of the cost of dentistry. In 2023 there were still many people over the age of 85 with no teeth.

People who qualify for the NHS Low Income Scheme do not have to pay, but they have to find a dentist who does NHS work. Other people have to pay standard charges - £23.80 for an examination, £65.20 for fillings, root canal treatment and removing teeth or £282.80 for more complex procedures, such as crowns, dentures and bridges. (2023 prices)

In 2023 many dentists had stopped taking on NHS patients. Only one in five dental practices in Scotland were taking on new NHS patients.

The term "Cockney" was used to describe a person from the East End, or born within earshot of Bow Bells - The Church of St Mary-le-Bow. Dick Whittington was supposed to have heard the bells calling him back to the city in 1392.

Dick Whittington

Dick Whittington, properly Sir Richard Whittington (1354 – March 1423), was four times Lord Mayor of London, a member of parliament and a Sheriff of London. He had no children and left his fortune (£7,000 equivalent to £6,300,000 in 2021) to form the Charity of Sir Richard Whittington.

His life was well known. He became a character in an English story that was adapted for the stage as a play, "The History of Richard Whittington, of his lowe byrth, his great fortune", in February 1604. This was turned into a pantomime called "Dick Whittington and His Cat." This tells how Dick, a boy from a poor Gloucestershire family, sets out for London to make his fortune, accompanied by, or later acquiring, his cat. At first he meets with little success, and is tempted to return home. However, on his way out of the city, whilst climbing Highgate Hill he hears the Bow Bells of London ringing, and believes they are sending him a message. There is now a large hospital on Highgate Hill, named the Whittington Hospital. A traditional rhyme associated with this tale is:Turn again, Whittington,

Once Lord Mayor of London!

Turn again, Whittington,

Twice Lord Mayor of London!

Turn again, Whittington,

Thrice Lord Mayor of London!

Hospitals in the United Kingdom

Hospitals in the United Kingdom are mostly now run by the National Health Service, but there are still a number of private hospitals, mostly in or near London. 

Before the NHS started in 1947 there were a very large number of small hospitals. It took over 1143 voluntary hospitals, with about 90,000 beds and 1545 municipal hospitals with about 390,000 beds. The average number of people in hospital beds went down from about 410,00 in 1960 to 341,000 in 1974, though the number of people treated went up. 

Voluntary hospitals started in the the eighteenth century in England. They gave free medical care to poor people. Their doctors were not paid for this. They made their money from private patients, who were mostly treated in their own homes. They were teaching hospitals and run as charities. 

Municipal hospitals were run by local government. They had taken over the workhouses after 1929. They were mostly for people with long term or infectious illnesses, mental illness and mental handicap. Hospitals for people with smallpox or tuberculosis were built in isolated places.

The people who worked in the hospitals under the NHS were paid by the rules of the Whitley councils.

Many of the small hospitals were closed by Nye Bevan in the first years of the NHS. In 1962 Enoch Powell launched the Hospital Plan which had plans for 90 new hospitals, 134 to be rebuilt and about 1000 more small hospitals to be closed. Not all of these were built. The new ones were called District General Hospitals, and they provided most services in the same building. The idea was to make sure there were enough beds in all parts of the country.

Whitley council

A Whitley council, also known as a joint industrial council, is a British organization which fixes wage rates, terms and conditions in a specific industry. They have both employers and trade unions. They were started in 1917.

In 1979 there were eight councils in the National Health Service covering all the NHS staff, except doctors and dentists.

In 2004 a new system was started for the NHS, called Agenda for Change. It has nine numbered pay bands subdivided into points, like the old alphabetic Whitley Council 'grades' pay scales.

Bathyphysa conifera

Bathyphysa conifera, is a species of siphonophore. They live about 1000 to 4000 meters below the ocean. This depth is called the bathypelagic zone.

"Bathyphysa conifera" was nicknamed the "Flying Spaghetti Monster" by the oil workers who first saw it. Its cluster of reproductive structures called gonophores look a bit like cones. 

"Bathyphysa conifera" is found in the Atlantic Ocean: off the coast of Gabon and as far south as Angola. It is also in Monterey Bay in the Pacific Ocean.

These colonial organisms are all composites: they are groups of organisms, not single organisms. This is usual for the jellyfish called siphonophores. 
It is a group of polyps with no propulsion. Without propulsion, "B. conifera" moves by contracting and relaxing the body stem. The tentacles have stinging cells called nematocysts.

The entire animal, including tentacles, is several meters long. The feeding polyps are pink when young, before developing tentacles. A mature feeding polyp is yellow with a single tentacle.

Colonies are unisexual, and reproduce by asexual reproduction. 

Like many siphonophores, it is carnivorous. The typical siphonophore diet consists of a variety of copepods, small crustaceans, and small fish. "B. conifera" has been seen eating a lanternfish.

A species of manefish in the genus "Caristius" associates mutualistically with "B. conifera", using it for shelter, stealing meals, and perhaps nibbling on its host as well. The fish protects it from amphipod parasites like "Themisto".

Tolulope Arotile

Tolulope Arotile (December 13, 1995 - July 14, 2020), also known as Tolulope Oluwatoyin Sarah Arotile, was Nigeria's first female combat helicopter pilot in the Nigerian Air Force.
She was credited with fighting against insecurity in the northern states of Nigeria.
On 29 July 2020, Isaiah Ogedegbe praised Arotile in his tribute, describing her as "a young, brilliant, and brave lady with a promising future".
Tolulope Arotile was born in Kaduna, Nigeria on 13 December 1995 to the family of Mr and Mrs Akintunde Arotile, but she came from the Iffe area in Ijumu Local Government Area of Kogi State, Nigeria.

She attended Air Force Primary School, Kaduna from 2000 to 2005 and Air Force Secondary School, Kaduna from 2006 to 2011 before she later gained admission into the Nigerian Defence Academy, Kaduna as a member of 64 Regular Course on 22 September 2012, where she got Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics.
Arotile had said she joined the military because of her love for the military. She had also said to be a military officer was her long time dream.

She was commissioned into the Nigerian Airforce on 16 September 2017 as a member of the Nigerian Defence Academy Regular Course 64.

She held a commercial pilot license and also underwent tactical flying training with the Agusta 109 Power Attack Helicopter in Italy.

In October 2019, the Nigerian Air Force had decorated her as the first female pilot that the service would get in 55 years.

On 14 July 2020, less than eight months since her decoration, Tolulope Arotile died at the age of 24 in Kaduna, Nigeria. The Nigeria President, the NAF, and the Nigerian masses were deeply touched by the news of her premature death resulting from a head injury she sustained in a car accident.

She was buried on 23 July 2020. She was remembered as a good woman who could have impacted the lives of many young Nigerian girls and women in the future.

Precision-guided munition

A smart bomb or smart ammunition is a kind of weapon that is able to hit a target more precisely. It will therefore do more damage to the intended target, and ideally, there will be less collateral damage. Officially, these bombs are called Precision-guided munition, or PGM. 

Such ammunition or bombs have the ability to influence their course, after they have been launched. 

Usually, such weapons have sensors, for example for:


During the First Gulf War guided munitions were only 9% of weapons fired, but they accounted for 75% of all successful hits. Despite guided weapons generally being used on more difficult targets, they were still 35 times more likely to destroy their targets per weapon dropped.

Altai Republic

The Altai Republic (; Altai: , "Altay Respublika"; , , ), also known as Gorno-Altai Republic, is a republic of Russia. It is in southern Siberia and is a part of the Siberian Federal District. It has an area of . It has a population of 210,924 people. It is the least-populous republic of Russia and least-populous federal subject in the Siberian Federal District. Gorno-Altaysk is the capital and the largest town of the republic.

The Altai Republic is one of Russia's ethnic republics. It mainly represents the indigenous Altai people. The Altai are a Turkic ethnic group that make up 37% of the republic's population, while ethnic Russians form a majority at 54%, and with minority populations of Kazakhs, other Central Asian ethnicities, and Germans. The official languages of the Altai Republic are Russian and Altai. Kazakh is official in areas where it is spoken more.

The Xiongnu Empire (209 BC – AD 93) owned the territory of the modern Altai Republic. The area was part of the First Turkic Khaganate, the Uyghur Empire, and the Yeniseian Kyrgyzs. This time was the time when Turkic cultures and languages became most common.

The southern part of the Altai Republic came under the Naiman Khanate. The territory of the modern Altai Republic has been ruled by the Mongolic Xianbei state (93–234), Rouran Khaganate (330–555), Mongol Empire (1206–1368), Golden Horde (1240–1502), Zunghar Khanate (1634–1758) and Qing Empire (1757–1864).

The entire Altan Nuur Uriankhai region was annexed into the Russian Empire in 1864–1867 by the Treaty of Tarbagatai. During the Russian Civil War, the Confederated Republic of Altai (Karakorum-Altai Region) was created in 1918. It claimed to be the first step to rebuilding Genghis Khan's Mongol Empire. But it never became a competing force in the Russian Civil War. It stayed neutral from 1918 until January 1920, when it was taken back by Russia. A second Altai Republic was formed in 1921 and lasted until 1922 when they were annexed by the Bolsheviks.

On June 1, 1922, the Oyrot Autonomous Oblast () was created in Altai Krai. This gave the Altai people more autonomy again. The original name for this region was Bazla. On January 7, 1948, it was renamed Gorno-Altai Autonomous Oblast (). In 1991 it was turned into the Gorno-Altai Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR). In 1992 it was renamed to the Altai Republic.

The Altai Republic is in the Altai Mountains. It is at the junction of the Siberian taiga, the Kazakh steppes, and the Mongolian semi-deserts. Forests cover about 25% of the republic. The highest point in the Altai Republic is Belukha Mountain, which stands at 4,506 m (14,783 ft) tall.

The Altai Republic borders Kemerovo Oblast to the north, Khakassia to the northeast, Tuva to the east, Altai Krai to the west/northwest, Mongolia (Bayan-Ölgii Province) to the southeast, China (Altay Prefecture, Xinjiang) to the south, and Kazakhstan (East Kazakhstan Region) to the south/southwest.

The republic has a temperate continental climate. It has short and mild summers (June–August) and long, cold, and often quite frosty winters (November–March).

In general, the republic's climate of the southeastern areas, such as the (Ulagansky and Kosh-Agachsky Districts), is harsher than the climate of the less elevated northern areas.


The Altai Republic is administratively divided into ten districts and Gorno-Altaysk Urban Okrug. The districts are further divided into ninety-two rural settlements.

Population:

According to the 2021 Census, ethnic Russians make up 53.7% of the republic's population. The indigenous Altai people make up 37.0%. Other groups include Kazakhs (6.4%), and several smaller groups.



Naré Maghann Konaté

Naré Maghann Konaté (died "c." 1218) was a 12th-century faama (king) of the Mandinka people, in what is today called Mali. He was the father of Sundiata Keita, who founded the Mali Empire, and a character in the oral tradition of the Epic of Sundiata.

In the Epic of Sundiata, Naré Maghann Konaté (also called Maghan Kon Fatta or Maghan the Handsome) was a Mandinka king who one day received a God-related hunter at his court. The hunter predicted that if Konaté married an ugly woman, she would give him a son who would one day be a mighty king. Naré Maghann Konaté was already married to Sassouma Berté and had a son by her, Dankaran Touman Keïta. However, when two Traoré hunters from the Do kingdom presented him an ugly, hunchbacked woman named Sogolon, he remembered the prediction and married her. She soon gave birth to a son, Sundiata, who was unable to walk throughout most of his childhood until 7 years old.

Circle dance

Circle dance, or chain dance, is a style of social dance done in a circle or a wavy line to background music, which has a beat and singing (sometimes just a beat without singing). It is a type of dance where anyone can join in without the need for a partner. 

Unlike line dancing, circle dancers connect with each other made by hand-to-hand, finger-to-finger or hands-on-shoulders, where they follow the leader around the dance floor. From gentle to energetic, the dance can be a fun group experience or part of a meditation.

Being probably the oldest known dance style, circle dancing is an old practice common to many cultures for celebrating special occasions, religious ceremonies, and for encouraging togetherness. Circle dances are performed to many different styles of music and rhythms. Modern circle dance mixes traditional folk dances, mainly from European or Near Eastern origins, with recently created ones to a variety of music both ancient and modern.

Modern circle dancing is found in many cultures, including Iraqi, Jordanian, Lebanese, Palestinian, Israeli, Assyrian, Kurdish, Turkish, Azerbaijani, Maltese, and Balkan.

Even though it is notable in the the Middle East and southeast Europe, circle dancing also has a historical importance in Brittany, Catalonia and Ireland to the west of Europe, and also in South America (Peruvian), Tibet, and with Native Americans. It is also used, in its more meditating form, in worship within various religious traditions including the Church of England and the Islamic Haḍra Dhikr (or Zikr) dances.

Some famous circle dances include Hora (Balkan), Kolo (Slavic), Sardana (Italy), Syrtos (Greece), An Dro (Breton), Dabke (Levant), Khigga (Assyrian), Kochari (Caucasus, Balkan and Anatolia), Tamzara (Caucasus, Anatolia and Greece).

Agustín Magaldi

Agustín Magaldi Coviello (December 1, 1898 – September 8, 1938) was an Argentinian tango and milonga singer-songwriter. His nickname was "La voz sentimental de Buenos Aires" ("The sentimental voice of Buenos Aires").
Magaldi took part in the opening broadcasts of Argentina's LOY Radio Nacional in July 1924.

Magaldi suffered from liver disease and was admitted to Sanatorium Otamendi early in September 1938. An operation by Dr. Pedro Valdez was successful, but Magaldi died 48 hours later. He was buried in La Chacarita Cemetery in Buenos Aires.

In the Andrew Lloyd Webber's and Tim Rice's musical "Evita", Magaldi is shown as bringing Eva Duarte to Buenos Aires and so is therefore referred to as "the first man to be of use to Eva Duarte".

There is some disagreement, however, about the role Magaldi played in Eva's real life, or that they knew each other. For example, in the biography "Evita: The Real Life of Eva Perón", biographers Marysa Navarro and Nicholas Fraser write that there are no records of Magaldi performing in Eva's hometown of Junín in the year that Eva is said to have met Magaldi.

A major historical error is that the musical shows Magaldi performing at a charity concert given in aid of the victims of an earthquake in San Juan, Argentina. The concert, where Eva Duarte and Juan Perón met for the first time, happened on January 22, 1944, when Magaldi had been dead for over five years.


Murder of David Gunn

Dr. David Gunn was a medical doctor, specialized in gynecology and obstetrics. On March 10, 1993, Michael Frederick Griffin shot and killed Dr. Gunn, in Pensacola, Florida. It was the first documented killing of an obstetrics and gynaecology doctor where the killer said he wanted to prevent a doctor from performing abortions in an act of anti-abortion violence in the United States.

A jury deliberated three hours before finding Griffin guilty on March 4, 1994. He was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison, which he is serving at Okaloosa Correctional Institution in Crestview, Florida. In November 2017, the Florida Commission on Offender Review set Griffin's tentative release date for March 4, 2043. Griffin can have his reliese date reviewed in 2024, and additional reviews after no more than 7 years.
