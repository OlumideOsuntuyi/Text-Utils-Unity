National Art Museum of Azerbaijan is the biggest art museum of Azerbaijan. It was founded in 1936 in Baku and in 1943 was named after Rustam Mustafayev, a famous Azerbaijani theater stage designer and theater artist. The museum's collection includes over 15,000 artworks. There are over 3,000 items in 60 rooms on permanent display. About 12,000 items are kept in storage. The museum often changes the temporary displays so that more of these stored artworks can be displayed for a short time. The museum is made up of two buildings standing next to each other.

Seven of the rooms in the first building show European art, and ten rooms show Russian art. European art includes artworks of Italian (Guercino, Leandro Bassano, Francesco Solimena, Lorenzo Bartolini), French (Jules Dupré, Gaspard Dughet, Pascal Dagnan-Bouveret, Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant), Dutch/Flemish (Frans Hals, Michiel Jansz van Mierevelt, Adriaen Brouwer, Adriaen van Ostade, Justus Sustermans, Pieter Claesz), German (Johann Heinrich Roos, Fritz August Kaulbach) and Polish (Jan Styka) painters.

The second building built in 1885 houses Eastern art, represented particularly by Persian, Turkish, Chinese and Japanese art. Russian art is represented notably by paintings of Karl Briullov, Alexey Venetsianov, Vasily Vereshchagin, Isaac Levitan, Vladimir Makovsky, Valentin Serov, Vladimir Borovikovsky, Vasily Tropinin, Konstantin Korovin and Ivan Shishkin. There are also restored artworks of Russian avant-garde.

Among Azerbaijani artists represented are painters Mir Mohsun Navvab, Bahruz Kangarli, Tair Salakhov, Azim Azimzade, Salam Salamzade, Vidadi Narimanbekov, Mikail Abdullayev, Togrul Narimanbekov and sculptor Omar Eldarov. The works of Sattar Bahlulzade fill one entire room. 

The museum also holds easel and book miniatures of 17th-19th centuries, lacquered (varnished) miniatures of 18th-19th centuries and a collection of sherbet spoons, made from mulberry tree.

The first works were acquired from Saint-Petersburg, Moscow and private collections. The museum expositions were later shown in Canada (1966), Cuba (1967), Syria (1968), France (1969), former Czechoslovakia, Algeria (both 1970), Iraq (1971) etc. The museum is open Tuesday to Sunday from 10:00 until 18:00.


Antonino Rocca

Antonino Rocca (born Antonino Biasetton, April 13, 1927 – March 15, 1977) was an Italian professional wrestler.

He was trained by professional wrestler Stanislaus Zbyszko in Argentina. During his professional wrestling career, he was known for his unique, acrobatic, off-the-ground, flying wrestling style.

Rocca was responsible for the revival of the New York City Metropolitan-Area territory in the late 1940s which would eventually become part of the modern World Wrestling Entertainment. Rocca would become one of the most well-known wrestlers in America during the golden age of television and had an uninterrupted seven-year run of headlining or co-headlining every main-event at the Garden. Aside from singles competition, Rocca had a successful tag team career with Miguel Pérez. Both Rocca and Pérez were known for drawing huge crowds to Madison Square Garden on a regular basis.

During the early 1950s, he held two regionally-recognized versions of professional-wrestling's world heavyweight singles-championship while he still headlined nationwide in territories where other wrestlers were the recognized champs. In 1949, he competed for the New York City-area territory owned by Joseph Raymond "Toots" Mondt and the Johnston family of promoters. He was considered to be the box-office draw that helped bring wrestling back to Madison Square Garden, on a regular basis, for the first time since 1938. In 1957, during a match against Dick the Bruiser, a riot erupted at Madison Square Garden when Rocca was busted open by Dick the Bruiser.

He formed a successful tag team with Jose Miguel Perez in 1957. They won the NWA Capitol World Tag Team Championship. They were never defeated after winning the title but it was abandoned after around five years. During 1959 and 1960, he briefly worked with Kola Kwariani and Jack Pfefer, who took effective control of the Garden's wrestling office. Rocca set the post-World War II record for wrestling-attendance at Madison Square Garden's 49th–50th Street location, drawing 21,950 fans in a singles-match against "the Amazing Zuma," a/k/a "Argentina Zuma," on January 2, 1960, as was reported by the New York Times.

After he was demoted, and because of the arrival of Buddy Rogers as the featured star at MSG in 1961, he left the WWWF and briefly set up a competing promotion (which was supported by Jim Crockett, Sr. and others) based at the Sunnyside arena in Queens, NY but it was believed to have failed and it shut down. During the mid-1970s, he teamed up with Vince McMahon to handle the color commentary on the WWWF's weekly television show. On February 25, 1977, he made an appearance with World Wide Wrestling Federation and officiated a boxing match between Gorilla Monsoon and André the Giant at the famed Madison Square Garden.

Rocca died on March 15, 1977, at Roosevelt Hospital in New York City after suffering complications following an infection. In 1995, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Kevin Nash.



Brownian motion

Brownian motion is the random motion of particles suspended in a medium (a liquid or a gas). The motion is caused by fast-moving atoms or molecules that hit the particles. Brownian Motion was discovered in 1827 by the botanist Robert Brown. In 1827, while looking through a microscope at particles trapped in cavities inside pollen grains in water, he noted that the particles moved through the water; but he was not able to find out what was causing this motion. 

Atoms and molecules had long been theorised as the main parts of matter. Albert Einstein published a paper in 1905 that explained in precise detail how the motion that Brown had observed was a result of the pollen being moved by individual water molecules. This was one of his first big contributions to science, and convinced many scientists that atoms and molecules exist. It was further verified experimentally by Jean Perrin in 1908. The direction of the force of atomic bombardment is constantly changing, and at different times the particle is hit more on one side than another, leading to the seemingly random nature of the motion.

There are too many molecular impacts making the Brownian pattern, so no scientific model can account for all of them. That is why only probabilistic models of molecular populations can be used to describe it. Two such models of the statistical mechanics were made by Einstein and Smoluchowski. Another, pure probabilistic kind of models are stochastic process models. There exist both simpler and more complicated stochastic processes which in extreme ("taken to the limit") may describe the Brownian Motion (see random walk and Donsker's theorem).

Norbert Wiener also studied Brownian Movement, with greater mathematical precision.

The Roman Lucretius's scientific poem "On the Nature of Things" (c. 60 BC) has a description of Brownian motion of dust particles in verses 113–140 from Book II. He uses this to help people know for sure of the existence of atoms:
"Observe what happens when sunlight is let into a building and small building light on its shadowy places. You will see an amount of tiny particles moving in an amount of ways..."

While Jan Ingenhousz described the strange motion of coal dust particles on the top of alcohol in 1785, the discovery of this is often given to the botanist Robert Brown in 1827. Brown was studying pollen grains of the plant "Clarkia pulchella" suspended in water under a microscope when he observed minute particles, ejected by the pollen grains, executing a jittery motion. By repeating the experiment with particles of inorganic matter he was able to rule out that the motion was life-related, although its origin was not known yet.

The first person to describe the mathematics behind Brownian motion was Thorvald N. Thiele in a paper on the method of least squares published in 1880. This was followed by Louis Bachelier in 1900 in his PhD thesis "The Theory of Speculation", in which he presented an analysis of the stock and option markets. The Brownian motion model of the stock market is often used, but Benoit Mandelbrot denied its applicability to stock price movements.

Albert Einstein (in one of his 1905 papers) and Marian Smoluchowski (1906) brought the solution of the problem to the attention of physicists, and presented it as a way to indirectly confirm the existence of atoms and molecules. Their equations describing Brownian motion were checked by the experimental work of Jean Baptiste Perrin in 1908. Perrin was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1926 "for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter". 

University of New Haven

The University of New Haven is a private and nonsectarian university within West Haven, Connecticut, which borders the much larger city of New Haven. The university was established in 1920 and given the name "University of New Haven" in 1970.

Kylie (album)

Kylie is the first album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue, released on 4 July 1988. The album was produced by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, who also wrote nine of the ten songs. Mostly a dance-pop album, it also contains many bubblegum pop elements.

All songs written and produced by Mike Stock, Matt Aitken and Pete Waterman, except where noted.

Monster movie

A monster movie (also called a creature feature or giant monster movie) is a movie with humans trying to stay alive in attacks by very large monsters. Monster movies can fit in the horror, fantasy, or science fiction genres. In Japan, large monsters are called kaiju.

In many monster movies, the monster is created by humans because of something such as a bad experiment, the effects of radiation, or the destruction of habitat. Since the 1953 movie "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms", many monster movies have shown the monster being created by nuclear warfare. One of the most well-known movie monsters, Godzilla, was created by a nuclear weapon. Godzilla has appeared in 28 movies and has become a cultural icon in Japan.

The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms

The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms is a 1953 science fiction monster movie. It was released on June 13, 1953, by Premier Productions. It was produced by Warner Bros. It made over $5 million, including $2.25 million in the United States in its first year.

The movie was the first movie to show a monster being woken up or created by an explosion from an atomic bomb. Its success helped cause the creation of more monster movies in the 1950s such as "Godzilla".

An atomic bomb test in the Arctic Circle wakes up a sleeping dinosaur, the fictional "Rhedosaurus". After being woken up, it destroys New York City before being killed at Coney Island.


Transkei

The Transkei (meaning "the area beyond the river Kei"), officially the Republic of Transkei was a Bantustan—an area for members of a specific ethnicity. It was in the southeastern region of South Africa. Its capital was Umtata (renamed Mthatha in 2004). President of South Africa Nelson Mandela was born here.

Xhosa language

Xhosa is one of the official languages of South Africa. Xhosa is spoken by 7.6 million people, or about 18% of the South African population. Xhosa is written using a Latin alphabet. Henry Hare Dugmore helped translate the entire Bible in Xhosa language. Xhosa has ten vowels.

Xhosa is well known for its set of three major clicks.

Thembu people

The Thembu is a tribe that was made to fall under the subgroup of the Xhosa people during the Apartheid period. They are one of the handful of nation groups that speak IsiXhosa in South Africa. The name in Xhosa is anathema, aba- a common prefix for peoples. The current reigning King of the aversion is King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo whose praise name is Zwelibanzi—the most recognizable Thembu person in Nelson Mandela. The traditional homeland of the Thembu is called Thembuland.Everyone is caca

University of Fort Hare

The University of Fort Hare is a public university in Alice, Eastern Cape, South Africa. It was an important university for black Africans from 1916 to 1959. 

It offered a Western-style, academically excellent education to students from across sub-Saharan Africa, creating a black African elite. Nelson Mandela studied at the university during his early years before leading a group of students on a political strike and getting expelled.


African National Congress Youth League

The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) is a part of the African National Congress for younger people. It was founded in 1944 by Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu. They created the foundation to put an end to apartheid in Africa.

The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) was established on 2 April 1944, by Anton Lambede (who became the League’s first President), Nelson Mandela, Ashby Mda, Walter Sisulu and Oliver Tambo. They were joined by, Duma Nokwe, B Masekela, Ida Mtwa, Lillian Ngoyi, James Njongweni, William Nkomo and Dan Tloome. The aim of the Youth League was to push the ANC away from the then South African version of Communism, towards its founding ideology which was Africanism. At the time the ANCYL was established, political circumstances in South Africa were tenuous as the ruling United Party was divided about South Africa’s participation in World War II. Four years after the establishment of the Youth League, the United Party’s rule came to an end and the country was subsequently governed by the National Party.


Inkatha Freedom Party

The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) is a political party in South Africa. Since it was founded it has been led by Mangosuthu Buthelezi. It is currently the fourth largest party in the National Assembly of South Africa. It was very close with the African National Congress. It was founded on 21 March 1975.

Sit-ski

A Sit-ski is a sled used by a skier with paraplegia, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, or cerebral palsy. It is made from fiberglass. Early sit-skis looked like kayaks and had metal edges.

Sit-skis are used for para-Nordic skiing and para-alpine skiing. If the sit-ski has one ski, it is sometimes name a mono-ski. If a sit-ski has two skis, it is sometimes called a bi-ski. Skiers first used bi-skis in para-alpine skiing before using mono-skis. Mono-skis allow skiers to ski using the same way that people who stand ski down a hill.

Sit-ski users use outrigger skis. In para-Nordic skiing, a sit-skier may use a normal ski pole that is not as long as one people standing up to ski would use.

When skiers first learn to ski, their teacher may be connected to them on a tether until the skier can control the sit-ski on their own.

Mono-ski

A mono-ski is a sled used by a skier with paraplegia, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, or cerebral palsy. Mono-skis are used only in para-alpine skiing. People who use mono-skis need good balance to stop themselves from falling over. The mono-ski has a chair with one ski attached to the bottom.

People first used mono-skis in 1985 in the United States. Mono-skis allow skiers to ski using the same way that people who stand ski down a hill.

Mono-skis have a hydraulic lift. This makes it easier for a skier to get in and out of the mono-ski.

Most distant things

This article lists the most distant things known to us, all of which are galaxies or energy sources inside galaxies. Their distances are described in two ways. redshift = z, and billion light years (Gly).

As of 2012, there are only about 50 possible objects z=8 or farther, and another 100 z=7 candidates. Candidates vary in their notability, so not everything is included here. 1 Gly = 1 billion light-years = 10 ly.


Double play

A double play is a play in baseball. It is when two outs are performed in one playing action. Double plays are called "the pitcher's best friend", because they cause more problems for offenses than any other plays. The most common type of double play is when there is a player on first base and a ground ball is hit toward the middle of the infield.

UDFj-39546284

UDFj-39546284 is a 'stellar structure' (probably a galaxy) reported January 27, 2011 as light from the oldest object. It was detected through infrared observation by the Hubble Space Telescope. It was reported in December 2012 to be at redshift z = 11.9 using Hubble and Spitzer telescope data, including Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF).

The actual stellar source of the light detected no longer exists. The image is likely to correspond to a compact mini-galaxy of blue stars that existed as we see it 13.42 billion years ago, around "380 million years" after the Big Bang (estimated at 13.8 billion years ago).

At the time of the announcement, it was the oldest galaxy found. It beat the previous distance record holder by about 150 million light years. With the revision of the distance, it again became the oldest galaxy found as of December 12, 2012. The next attempt to see further will be the James Webb Space Telescope launched sometime this decade.

Unlike UDFy-38135539, UDFj-39546284 has not been spectroscopically confirmed. A galaxy first formed near to the end of the Dark Ages, it offers information from early after the Big Bang.

Anthem of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic

The Anthem of Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic () was the national anthem of Armenia when it was a republic of the Soviet Union.

The writer of the lyrics was Sarmen (Armenak Sarkisyan), a poet. The composer of this song was Aram Khachaturian. He was known for his ballets. 

Like many national anthems of republics of the Soviet Union, this song praised Vladimir Lenin, the October Revolution and Communism. It also praised the friendship of republics of the Soviet Union. "Hayastan" in the lyrics was the name that the Armenian ethnic called themselves. "Severe" in the lyrics means the Armenian history, such as earthquakes.

After Armenia became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991, the national anthem was changed to "Our Fatherland".


University of Rhode Island

The University of Rhode Island (URI) is the main public research university in the U.S. State of Rhode Island. It was established in 1892 as Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. The name was changed to Rhode Island State College around 1909, and officially to University of Rhode Island during 1951. URI is in Kingston, Rhode Island.

In 1888 the university was chartered as Rhode Island's agricultural school and became the Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in 1892. The first class of 17 students was graduated two years later.

Fluorescence

Fluorescence is the light given off by certain substances when it absorbs light or other electromagnetic radiation. First the substance absorbs the energy, then it emits light. When the light source is removed, the fluorescence stops occurring. It is a form of luminescence. 

In most cases, the light given off has a longer wavelength and lower energy than the absorbed light.

One of the most surprising types of fluorescence is when a substance absorbs ultraviolet light that cannot be seen by the human eye, but gives off visible light.

Fluorescence is used in many fields such as mineralogy, gemology, chemical sensors (fluorescence spectroscopy), dyes, biological detectors, and fluorescent lights.

Fluorescence in the life sciences is a way of tracking biological molecules. A protein or other component can have a fluorescent dye attached to it, which allows a scientist to visually find the specific protein with a microscope.

Travesti

In theatre, travesti (meaning "disguised") is a character performed by a person of the opposite gender. A woman performing as a male in male clothing is called a breeches role. Famous travesty roles in opera include Cherubino in "The Marriage of Figaro", Siebel in "Faust", and Octavian in "Der Rosenkavalier". In ballet, the role of Frantz in "Coppélia" was a travesty role at the Paris Opéra until the 1950s. Carabosse in Tchaikovsky's ballet "The Sleeping Beauty" is performed by a man in woman's clothing. The Stepsisters in Prokofiev's ballet "Cinderella" are sometimes played by men in women's clothing. The title character is a travesty role in the Broadway musical "Peter Pan".

Greyfriars Bobby

Greyfriars Bobby (4 May 1855 - 14 January 1872) was a Skye terrier. He belonged to a policeman in Edinburgh named John Gray. When Mr. Gray died in 1858, he was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard. Bobby stayed near the grave of Mr. Gray long after the funeral. He would not leave. 

The little dog came to be called Greyfriars Bobby. He stayed at the grave for the rest of his life. Bobby died in 1872. He was buried just inside the gates of the kirkyard. His grave is marked by a small pink granite stone. Bobby's collar and bowl are displayed in the Museum of Edinburgh.

In 1873, Lady Angela Burdett-Coutts erected a drinking fountain "(pictured)" in Edinburgh to the memory of Greyfriars Bobby. The bronze statue of Bobby on top of the fountain was made by William Brodie. The fountain and statue have long been favourites of Scots. 

The fountain is near the George IV Bridge in Edinburgh. The statue of Bobby sits on top of a column of granite. At the bottom, there is an eight-sided drinking basin for dogs. Near the top, there is a drinking spout for people. In 1957, the water was turned off because of health concerns. 

Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson wrote a book about Bobby in 1912. It has never been out of print. A movie based on the book was made in 1961. This movie stars Tam O'Shanter as Bobby, and is described as "a tearjerker, one that saddens and lifts the spirit at the same time."

Luminescence

Luminescence is light emitted by a substance not caused by heat. In contrast, incandescence is light emitted by a substance as a result of heating.

Luminescence can be caused by chemical reactions, electrical energy, subatomic motions, or piezoelectricity (stress on a crystal). The term 'luminescence' was introduced in 1888 by Eilhard Wiedemann.

The dials, hands, scales and signs of aviation and navigational instruments and markings are often coated with luminescent materials in a process known as 'luminising'.


Victim blaming

Victim blaming is holding the victim of a crime responsible for that crime. Starting in the 1970s, the term was commonly used in the United States. It was mainly used in connection with trials for rape, as well those with a racist background.

In 1947 Theodor W. Adorno defined what would be later called "blaming the victim," as "one of the most sinister features of the Fascist character". Shortly after, Adorno and three other professors at the University of California, Berkeley created their influential and highly debated "F-scale" (F for fascist), published in "The Authoritarian Personality" (1950), which included among the fascist traits of the scale the "contempt for everything discriminated against or weak." A common example of victim blaming is the "asking for it" idiom, e.g. "she was asking for it" said of a victim of violence or sexual assault.

Roy Baumeisteress, a social and personality psychologist, argued that blaming the victim is not always wrong. According to him, it can lead to new ideas that show that the victim was at least partly responsible for the act. Baumeister argues that the common explanations of violence and cruelty are not helpful because they say that the victim was innocent. According to him, in the classic telling of "the myth of pure evil," the innocent, well-meaning victims are going about their business when they are suddenly assaulted by terrible villains. The situation, however, is not this simple; In most cases, the victim has done something to either anger the offender, or to help the offender's actions. In spite of this, the actions that follow may be more important than the "victim's" first offense.

In 2005, Australian Muslim preacher Feiz Mohammad gave a speech in Australia in which he blamed women for being rape victims. He said: "A victim of rape every minute somewhere in the world. Why? No one to blame but herself. She displayed her beauty to the entire world... Strapless, backless, sleeveless, showing their legs, nothing but satanic skirts, slit skirts, translucent blouses, miniskirts, tight jeans: all this to tease man and appeal to his carnal [sexual] nature.

In a case that became famous in 2011, an eleven-year-old victim of repeated gang rapes in Cleveland, Texas, was accused by the defense attorney of sexually attracting men on purpose so that they would try to rape her. "Like the spider and the fly. Wasn't she saying, 'Come into my parlor, said the spider to the fly?' ", he asked a witness. The "New York Times" ran an article uncritically reporting on the way many in the community blamed the victim, for which the newspaper later apologized.

In a case that attracted worldwide coverage, when a woman was raped and killed in India in December 2012, some Indian government officials and political leaders blamed the victim for her outfit and being out late at night.


Greyfriars Bobby (movie)

Greyfriars Bobby is a family-oriented Walt Disney movie from 1961. It was based on Eleanor Atkinson's 1912 book of the same name. The movie was directed by Don Chaffey, and stars Donald Crisp and Laurence Naismith. The movie is about a Skye terrier named Bobby. When his master dies, Bobby will not leave his graveside in Greyfriars Kirkyard. Two men in the neighborhood quarrel over owning the dog, but the dog remains on his master's grave. When "Greyfriars Bobby" is threatened with being put down because he does not have a license, the poor children of the neighborhood use their money to buy him the needed license. Bobby is given the freedom of the city.

Ambroise Vollard

Ambroise Vollard (3 July 1866 – 21 July 1939) was one of the most important dealers in French modern art in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. He had his portrait painted by so many artists that Picasso said "The most beautiful woman who ever lived has never had her portrait painted, drawn, or engraved any oftener than Vollard".

In most cases he bought art directly from the painters of his day. He was the first owner of Cézanne's "Vue sur l'Estaque et le Chateau d'If". This sold at Christie's in London for £13,522,500 in February 1015.

He sold these almost unknown artists, who became world-famous. They included Paul Cézanne, Aristide Maillol, Renoir, Louis Valtat, Pablo Picasso, André Derain, Georges Rouault, Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh. He was also an avid art collector and publisher.

After graduation, Vollard became a collector-dealer in art. In 1893, he started his own art gallery, at Rue Laffitte, then the center of the Parisian market for modern art. There Vollard put on his first major exhibition: Manet and others were followed by Gauguin and Van Gogh (4 – 30 June 1895).

Not attractive in appearance, he was a very shrewd businessman who made a fortune. In 1930 Vollard commissioned Picasso to produce a suite of 100 etchings which became known as the "Vollard Suite".

Vollard would later write biographies of Cézanne (1914), Degas, and Renoir, as well as the charming "Recollections of a Picture Dealer" (1936). Vollard was killed in July 1939, at the age of 73, on his way to Paris, when his chauffer-driven car skidded off the road.

News of his death prompted this letter from one artist to another:

Vollard died without direct heirs. Much of the art was left to extended family and close friends, although a significant number of works apparently were sold, dispersed, or disappeared during World War II.

More than 80 years after his death, works from his collection were sold after agreement with the various claimants to his estate. Massive auctions were held by Sotheby's in Paris and London in June 2010.

List of monarchs of Wessex

This is a list of monarchs of Wessex until 927. For later monarchs, see the List of English monarchs. Details for many of the later English monarchs are confirmed by a number of sources. But the earliest kings of Wessex predate many written sources. Wessex was one of the seven kingdoms of the British Heptarchy. This is a later name given to the seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England during the early Middle Ages. Besides Wessex it included Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia, Essex, Kent, and Sussex. 

The year 865 saw the arrival of the Great Heathen Army in East Anglia. One by one the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were defeated by the Danes (Vikings). By the close of the ninth century the last four independent kingdoms of England had been reduced to just one. Wessex was the only remaining kingdom not destroyed by the Vikings. Under Alfred the Great Wessex became the core of a unified England. His grandson, Athelstan was the first King of England.

Greyfriars Kirkyard

Greyfriars Kirkyard is a cemetery in Edinburgh, Scotland. It surrounds Greyfriars Kirk in the Old Town. Burials have been held since the late 16th century. The kirk and its monuments are protected as a category A-listed building. The kirkyard is said to be haunted. 

Many notable Scots are buried in the kirkyard including Sir George Mackenzie, Lord Advocate Mary Erskine, Regent of Scotland George Buchanan, and John Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton. The kirkyard is the resting place of Greyfriars Bobby, a Skye terrier who stayed by his master's grave in the kirkyard for 14 years.

Skye terrier

The Skye terrier is a breed of dog. It is medium sized with short legs, a long body, and a large head. It has a long coat of hair that protects the animal from injury and bad weather. It is one of the oldest terrier breeds, and has its origins on the Isle of Skye, Scotland. The dog was bred to destroy the pests around farms and livestock. The dog became popular in the 19th century because Queen Victoria made it a favorite. The most famous Skye terrier is Greyfriars Bobby. He stayed beside his master's grave for 14 years, rain or shine. There is a statue and fountain in Edinburgh that remembers him.

1945 Empire State Building B-25 crash

The B-25 Empire State Building crash was a plane crash that occurred on July 28, 1945. On that date, a B-25 Mitchell plane in heavy fog crashed into the Empire State Building in New York City. It caused 14 deaths (three people in the plane and eleven people in the building). It caused damage of around $1 million.

The plane crashed between the 78th and 80th floors of the building, leaving a 18 ft (5.5 m) by 20 ft (6.1 m) hole in the building. The fire that was started was put out in 40 minutes. It is the only fire at such a height that has been successfully put out. Elevator operator Betty Lou Oliver survived a fall of 75 floors, which is the Guinness World Record for the longest fall survived in an elevator. The building was reopened the Monday after the crash.


Pulp fiction

Pulp fiction is a kind of literature. It gets its name from the cheap, wood pulp paper it was printed on. Pulp fiction covered several genres: romance, western, science fiction, horror, detective, adventure, etc. It was most popular in the United States during the 1920s–1940s. Publication then decreased, perhaps because television took over the evening hours for readers and magazines were not read as often. Pulp fiction was published in a cheap magazine format often with gaudy covers. Stories were sometimes serialized, meaning the reader had to buy each monthly issue over a period of time to complete a particular story. 

Japanese occupation of Hong Kong

The Japanese occupation of Hong Kong (Chinese: ) was a time when Japan controlled Hong Kong. It began when the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Mark Young, gave up the British Crown colony of Hong Kong to Empire of Japan on 25 December 1941. The occupation lasted for three years and eight months until Japan gave up at the end of Second World War.

One day after the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong started, the Japanese military yen was changed to the only legal currency of Hong Kong. In January 1942, two Hong Kong dollars could be converted to one Japanese military yen. However, in July, four Hong Kong dollars were needed to be converted to one Japanese military yen.

All primary schools and secondary schools had to teach Japanese. They were not allowed to teach English.

Wankel engine

The Wankel engine is a type of combustion engine. It is sometimes called a rotary engine. The Wankel engine is better than an engine of the reciprocating piston design because it is more compact and simple. 
However, so far, nobody has found a good enough solution to the fact that oil (lubricant) has to be burnt along with the fuel. This causes pollution issues, besides wasting oil. This is why most vehicles still use piston engines.
The Wankel engine was first thought of by German engineer Felix Wankel in 1929. He started working on it in the early 1950s along with German car company NSU. Since, it has been used by various other car companies, but mostly in prototype cars. One exception was Mazda, which made several cars that used Wankel engines, with the most well known one being the Mazda RX-7. As of 2021, there are no cars in production that have Wankel engines.

The Wankel engine works in a way similar to that of a regular four-stroke engine but instead of a piston going up and down, a triangle-shaped metal rotor revolves around the rod that connects to the wheels. Unfortunately, the way it works causes it to burn oil (lubricant), and this causes emissions to increase, which is why no cars use this kind of engine nowadays.

Parking lot

A parking lot (or car park) is an area where cars and other vehicles are parked and left temporarily. Parking lots are usually flat. The surface is usually made of asphalt, concrete, or gravel. Some lots may be bare earth. The paving material in a parking lot can heat quickly in the sun. A parked car can get hot, too. Children, older people, and animals such as dogs and cats should not be left in a parked car. They can die in a hot car.

Lines are put on paved lots to create the outlines of parking spaces. People leave their cars in these spaces while they go shopping, go to work, or do errands. Some spaces are set aside for disabled drivers or disabled passengers. These spaces are clearly marked. A disabled driver needs a special badge or insignia issued by the government to use these spaces. Disabled spaces are usually close to the front of a lot. Drivers who are not disabled can be fined or their cars towed if they use these spaces. 

Parking lots are usually near businesses, hospitals, government buildings, schools, hotels, zoos, etc. If many people go to these places, then the parking lots will be large. If not too many people go to these places, then the parking lots will be small. Small lots are usually unsupervised. Large lots are usually supervised by an attendant stationed in a small booth at the lot's entrance. He may issue a pass to a vehicle's driver that is stamped with the vehicle's arrival time. He will collect a fee from the driver when the vehicle leaves the lot. Some hotels provide free parking and those parking lots are big enough with lot of entrance. 

At a rural event such as a county fair, concert, auction, barn sale, corn maze, or pick-your-own strawberry patch, a parking lot may be nothing more than a large area of bare earth or a meadow that has been mowed for parking. Ropes or bales of hay may be used to mark the area for parking. An attendant may or may not be present. If present, he or she will advise a driver where to park in the lot and may or may not collect a fee. 

Parking lots can be dangerous, especially at night. Some lots are poorly supervised and dimly lit. Persons intent on mischief such as tire-slashers or criminal activity such as prostitutes, burglars, thieves, rapists, and drug dealers can operate without being easily seen. Anything valuable such as money, weapons, packages, children, or animals should "never" be left alone in a parked car. These will tempt thieves and child or animal snatchers. 
Broken glass, rusty nails, potholes, and rats can be parking lot hazards to people and their vehicles.

The automated parking system works with a combination of conveyance devices, software technology, and a mobile app for the best user experience. The system consists of an array of electro-mechanical infrastructure and computer-controlled robots. The conveying devices are capable of vertical and horizontal movement and used to store/retrieve vehicles to/from available multi-depth parking positions without human intervention. The very first automated parking garage was built in 1905: Garage Rue de Ponthieu in Paris, France.

The Great Redwall Feast

The Great Redwall Feast is a picture book written by Brian Jacques. The pictures were drawn by the well-known Redwall artist Christopher Denise. It was published in 1996.

"The Great Redwall Feast" is the first "Redwall" picture book, and it was written like a ballad. The animals of Redwall Abbey prepare a surprise feast for their .

"The Great Redwall Feast" is a story about the creatures of Redwall preparing for a feast while Matthias the Warriormouse, Constance the Badger , Foremole, and the Abbot are traveling in Mossflower Woods looking for a mysterious Bobbatan Weary Nod. The book shows the Abbeydwellers bustling in Redwall, cooking, gathering flowers, and doing other things for the feast for their beloved Abbot (probably Abbot Mordalfus). Many characters from "Redwall" and "Mattimeo" are in the book, but the baby mole Bungo is the only character in the book that wasn't in any Redwall novel.

The warm-colored pictures by Christopher Denise were drawn on brown butcher paper using , and instead of showing the Redwallers getting ready for war, it shows them much happier and friendly, at work in their daily lives.

Brian Jacques said that "The Great Redwall Feast" was "written a little more for mothers to read to their children, but many Redwall lovers will also enjoy it, because there is the challenge of solving a riddle before the end of the rhyme."

Lightsaber

A lightsaber is a weapon used in the fictional "Star Wars" universe. Lightsabers are usually used by the Jedi and the Sith, and sometimes other factions.

A lightsaber resembles a sword, but instead of having a blade made out of metal, lightsabers have a plasma laser beam for the blade, powered by an internal power cell contained within the hilt. This beam is very powerful and can cut through almost anything.

A lightsaber's blade will typically be red, blue, or green. The Sith are known to wield red lightsabers, and the Jedi are known for their signature blue and green lightsabers. In some of the Expanded Universe books, there are lightsabers that appear in a variety of other colors as well.

Biceps

The biceps brachii is a muscle in the arm. It has two parts, a long part and a short part. Using the elbow the muscle helps the movement of the forearm. When the muscle shortens, it bends the elbow and twists the forearm so that the palm faces up. The two parts of the muscle start on different parts of the shoulder blade and end together on the forearm.

The biceps is also a muscle in other quadrupeds. In humans, the muscle is more complex, and allows more complex movement than in other quadrupeds. 

The word biceps literally means two-headed, and refers to the fact that the muscle attaches to two different parts of the shoulder. In quadrupeds, the muscle only attaches at one point of the shoulder. 

Philanthropy

Philanthropy is doing something for the public good to improve other people's lives. A person who does that is called a philanthropist. Philanthropy often involves donating money for things that need to be done.

The word "philanthropy" comes from Greek words that mean "love of humanity". Former President of Uruguay, José Mujica donated 90% of his salary to charity. This is an example of philanthropy. 

Today philanthropy is used for public good, focusing on quality of life. People owning big business donates their salary to charities such as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Lee Miglin, Chuck Feeney, Mr Beast and Ted Turner. 


Altenbrunslar

Altenbunslar is one of the sixteen villages that form the town of Felsberg in Schwalm-Eder-Kreis, North Hesse, Germany. The nearest city is Kassel.

Approximately 306 people live in the village.

The village is on the eastern bank of the Eder River. To the east of the village is the "Quillerwald" (English: "Quiller Forest") or "Markwald" (English: "common forest"). This forest once belonged to all the villages around it. The people of the villages were allowed to cut down trees and to let animals feed there, but they were not allowed to hunt in the forest. The Eder River meets the Fulda River just (5.6 mi) upstream from Altenbrunslar at Edermünde.

The bedrock is made up of differently-coloured sandstones. The hilly landscape is formed by way that the sandstone wears down evenly. Some steep hills are the remains of volcanoes. The volcanoes were active in this area about 15-20 million years ago.

3000 years before the birth of Christ, the area was inhabited by a prehistoric people.

The name "Bruneslar" was first recorded in 1154. The name "Altenbrunslar" was first used in 1381. It was owned by a local knight.

In 1532 Altenbrunslar received a monk from a nearby monastery.

In the Middle Ages Altenbrunslar belonged to the town of Felsberg. This later became part of Napoleon's Kingdom of Westphalia and then it became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. On 1 February 1971, Altenbrunslar joined Neuenbrunslar to become the "Brunslar Community". This in turn became part of the town of Felsberg on 1 January 1974.

A railway was constructed through the village in 1848. In 1849 Altenbrunslar received a railway station. On 3 September 1849 the first train came through Altenbrunslar, pulled by a locomotive called "Hassia".

In the Second World War the Allies destroyed Edersee Dam on the night of 16-17 May 1943. A big flood wave hit the village half an hour later. The people of the village heard the news on the radio and ran into the forest. The water flooded the Eder valley. The bridge in Altenbrunslar was not knocked down by the water.

The first stone bridge over the Eder River at Altenbrunslar was built in 1885. Before this there was a wooden bridge in summer and a ferryman with a boat in winter.
The small chapel in Altenbrunslar is a protected building. It was built in the 10th Century. In 1861 a wooden second storey was built on the chapel. In 2000, the chapel was completely renovated. The villagers believe that the church bell came from the nearby village of Brechelsdorf. Brechelsdorf is a nearby village that was destroyed many years ago.

Altenbrunslar was the "Dolles Dorf" (English: great village) in the Hessischer Rundfunk television programme of the same name. A ten-minute movie about the village was first shown on 25 August 2012. It can be seen still on the "Dolles Dorf" HR website.

Mercia

Mercia was one of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of the Heptarchy. It was in the region now known as the English Midlands now East Midlands & West Midlands. Mercia was centered on the valley of the River Trent and its tributaries. Settled by Angles, their name is the root of the name 'England'. Their neighbors included other Angles, Saxons and all from Germany. Mercia bordered on Northumbria, Wessex, Sussex, Essex and East Anglia. To the west were Britons in Powys and the kingdoms of southern Wales. Its capital was Tamworth, which is today part of Staffordshire.

Archaeological discoveries show the first settlements were in the Trent river valley. The original kingdom of Mercia had a variety of different kinds of land. Most of it would not have been the first choice of anyone wishing to settle there. Not if better land was available elsewhere. The name 'Mercia' comes from the tribal name "Mierce", which means 'boundary folk.' It was probably a name already known in the English midlands and was adopted by the Angles who settled there. The Angles, according to Bede, came from "Angulus" in northern Germany. They were of the same stock as the East Anglians and the Northumbrians. The invasion of England by the Germanic tribes was relatively quick. By England was a large collection of small kingdoms each having a warlord or petty king. Within 200 years of their arrival in England, the late seventh century, emerged the Heptarchy: the seven kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England. Mercia was the dominant power among the Anglo-Saxons from the middle of the seventh century to the early ninth century. Several Mercian noblewomen played an important role in Mercian affairs. This is in contrast to Wessex where women rarely had an active role in the government. During the seventh and eighth centuries Mercia struggled mainly with Northumbria. By the ninth century Wessex was the dominant power in the region. King Egbert of Wessex (802–839) was the overlord and for the first time passed this position down to his heirs. From this time on until they ceased to exist as a kingdom, Mercia was a vassal kingdom to Wessex. In the last quarter of the ninth century Mercia lost much of its territory in the midlands to Danish settlers.

Christianity was introduced into Mercia in the 650s. The first monks were Irish followed by Northumbrians. By 653 a single was established and a series of Irish trained bishops followed. In 674 a second diocese was established for eastern Mercia.

Penda (–655) was a pagan king of Mercia. He was able to put together a of a number of smaller kingdoms and from that he created Mercia. But in the 630s he was not able to compete with the larger Anglo-Saxon kingdoms that were around his. Northumberland was threatening to expand into the territory of Mercia. Penda found it convenient to ally with Gwynedd, the dominant British kingdom to the west. It was an unusual cooperation between Christians and pagans, but it worked. Together they defeated the Northumbrian king, Edwin, who died at the battle of Hatfield Chase.

Athelred I (675–716) was the third of Penda's sons to be king of Mercia. He ravaged Kent to prevent them from breaking away from his rule. In 679 he was at war with Northumbria. According to Bede, Theodore Archbishop of Canterbury between the two kings to restore peace. He married Ostryth, daughter of the king of Bernicia. He was a Christian king who founded several churches and monasteries. He stepped down as king in 704 and passed the crown to his nephew Cenred. He was of the monastery of Bardsey and appears to have died about 716.

Offa (757–796), was the first of the Anglo-Saxon kings who might rightly be called "king of the English". He was the son of Thingfrith, the brother of Penda. He struggled to gain control of Mercia having come to power just after a civil war. But he proved to be ruthless, bold and creative in bringing Kent, Sussex and Essex under his control. Offa had diplomatic relations with Charlemagne. He was one of the few Anglo-Saxon monarchs to have dealings with continental rulers. Letters and presents were exchanged. But when Offa sought a marriage of his son to one of Charlemagne's daughters, relations were quickly cut off. Frankish ports were closed to British ships. Offa, very involved in church affairs, presided over church councils personally in 786-7. In 787 he convinced the pope to create the position of archbishop of Lichfield in Mercia. He wanted his own archbishop who was closer at hand than the Archbishop of Canterbury. He reorganized the of his kingdom. One of these defenses, Offa's Dyke was a massive earthworks between Mercia and the Welsh kingdoms to the west. Offa died in 796. His son, Ecgfrith, lasted only 141 days as king. Mercia was never again as powerful as it was during Offa's reign.

A new Mercian king, Raedwulf, was killed by Viking raiders in 844. In 855 Viking bands were recorded as being in Mercia near Wrekin. But the year 865 saw a major change in activity by the Scandinavian invaders. This was a much larger military force than had been seen before. The arrival of the Great Heathen Army in East Anglia. For a time the Danes (Vikings) were more interested in Northumbria. They gained control of York and moved south into Mercia then camped for the winter in Nottingham. In the spring of 868 a combined Mercian and West Saxon army came against the Vikings, but there was no battle. The Mercian king Burghred made a peace treaty with the invaders, who then moved north to York. In 873 Burghred was forced out of Mercia by the Vikings who then set their own choice of King, Ceowulf. In 874 the heathen army split with Halfdan, one of the leaders taking his band north. In 878 the Vikings in Mercia were attacked and defeated by King Alfred of Wessex. They converted to Christianity and settled on the land in East Anglia.

The ninth century saw the decline of Mercia as a kingdom. In 873-74 Mercia was conquered by the heathen army. In the 880s Wessex formed a marriage alliance with Mercia. Alfred's daughter, Aethelflaed , married Aethelred (II), of Mercia. When Aethelred died, in 912, Edward the Elder appointed Aethelflaed (his sister) 'Lady of the Mercians.' When Aethelflaed died in 918, the Mercian nobles now thought themselves free of Wessex rule. Edward stepped in and appointed Aethelflaed's daughter, Aelfwynn, to rule Mercia as his representative. But in 919 Edward brought her back to Wessex. After that Mercia was considered just another shire under his rule. A series of (similar to a count in Europe) followed. Under Canute in 1017, Mercia became one of the four divisions of England.

Stormtrooper (Star Wars)

Stormtroopers are highly trained human soldiers In the Star Wars universe. They are the main military forces for the Galactic Empire. During the original Star Wars movie series (, and ) they worked for Darth Sidious and Darth Vader.

Stormtroopers wear white armor and helmets. They are armed with blaster guns. Stormtroopers replaced the clone troopers which were first seen in . Clone troopers where clones of the bounty hunter, Jango Fett. These clones were used in "Attack of the Clones" and "" as well as the animated movie and television series "". By the time of the original series, the clone had been replaced by normal humans. After the deaths of Sidious and Vader in "Return of the Jedi", stormtroopers continued to serve the remaining leaders of the Galactic Empire. They can be seen in the third Star Wars trilogy, "The Skywalker Saga" (, and ). In these movies, the stormtroopers are seen working for the First Order. This group is the main remaining part of the Empire.

In addition to the basic stormtrooper, there are many different types of stormtroop. Each type is either trained for a specific job or the are equipt to work in different environments. The snowtroopers seen on the snow covered planet Hoth at the start of "Empire Stikes Back" are an example of specialized troopers. They wear special armor that is made to help protect them from the cold. Other examples of specialized troopers include the TIE pilots from A New Hope and the scout troopers seen on Endor in "Return of the Jedi." There are many other types of troopers in the Star Wars books, comics and video games.

Value judgement

A value judgement (or value judgment) is an opinion of the rightness or wrongness or usefulness of something.

It is based on what a person thinks or prefers. Value judgments are not true or false. This is because they are not objective. They are decisions about how a person thinks or feels, or about what action a person thinks should be taken. They are opinions.

A typical dictionary definition runs:

Ski pole

Ski poles are carried by skiers to help them not falling over. They are called "ski sticks" in the United Kingdom. In France, they are called "batons". 

Ski poles in alpine skiing are shorter than ski poles in Nordic skiing. Longer ski poles are used in cross country and free style skiing.

They are made from metal or composite material.

Ski poles have been used for a long time. People first used one ski pole when skiing. The first ski poles could also be used as a weapon. A flat circle was put near the bottom of the ski pole in the 17th century. This made it so the ski pole would not go all the way down to the ground. People started to use two ski poles by the start of World War I.

A steel ski pole was first made in 1937. It was invented by Otto Lang. Before this, some people used bamboo for ski poles. More and more people started using metal ski poles after World War II.

Lots of changes were made to ski poles from 1950 to 1975.

Galapagos shark

The Galapagos shark ("Carcharhinus galapagensis") is a species of Requiem shark, in the order of Carcharhiniformes. The Galapagos shark is a large species, reaching a maximum length of up to 12.1 feet (3.8 metres), and weighing up to 86 kg. This species is found in tropical waters surrounding oceanic islands, and is found in the Pacific, Atlantic, and western Indian Ocean.

The Galapagos shark was originally described as "Carcharias galapagensis" by Robert Evans Snodgrass and Edmund Heller in 1905, and was later moved to the genus "Carcharhinus". The holotype was a 64 cm (2.13 feet) long fetus from the Galapagos Islands, giving it the specific name "galapagensis".

Garrick (1982) placed the Galapagos shark and the Dusky shark at the center of the "obscurus group", one of two major groupings within "Carcharhinus". The group consisted of the Bignose shark, the Caribbean reef shark, the Sandbar shark, the Dusky shark, and the Oceanic whitetip shark; all large, triangular-toothed sharks. Based on allozyme data, Naylor (1992) changed this group, with the additions of the Silky shark, and the Blue shark. The closest relatives of the Galapagos shark were found to be the Dusky shark, the Oceanic whitetip shark, and the Blue shark. 

The Galapagos shark reaches a maximum length of 12.1 feet (3.8 metres). Male individuals mature at lengths of 6.9-7.5 feet (2.1-2.3 metres), while females mature at 7.2-8.2 feet (2.2-2.5 metres) in length. The maximum weight for this species is 86 kg. 

The Galapagos shark is a large shark with a slim, fusiform body, and a low inter-dorsal ridge between the first and second dorsal fin. The first dorsal fin is tall and nearly straight. The long pelvic fins are straight, each with a pointed tip. The snout of the Galapagos shark is widely rounded.
The Galapagos shark resembles the Grey reef shark, but can be distinguished by its more slender body, and by the slightly rounded tip on the first dorsal fin. The Galapagos shark also strongly resembles the Dusky shark, but has a much more straighter first dorsal fin, and it has larger teeth than the Dusky shark. However, this can be difficult to distinguish without direct comparison of the two species. The Galapagos shark has a brownish-grey upper body, and a white belly. A white stripe can sometimes be seen on the sides of the shark. Their pectoral fins are solid grey with slightly dusky tips. 

The Galapagos shark is circumtropical in distribution with a preference for waters surrounding oceanic islands. In the Atlantic Ocean, this shark is found at St. Paul's Rocks, Ascension Island, Cape Verde, Saint Helena, São Tomé, Bermuda, and the Virgin Islands. In the western Indian Ocean it is found off Walter's Shoal, south of Madagascar. In the Pacific Ocean, the Galapagos shark is found off Lord Howe Island, Tuamoto Archipelago, Middleton and Elizabeth Reefs, Hawaii, Revillagigedo Islands, Clipperton Island, Cocos Island, and Galápagos Islands. Distribution limits are not well defined due to confusion with similar species of sharks. 

The Galapagos shark is a common, but habitat-limited, tropical shark found inshore as well as offshore, near insular and continental shelves, between 39°N-33°S, at depths up to 180 metres. This species prefers clear water with coral and rocky bottoms. Although it is a coastal-pelagic species, it is capable of crossing considerable distances of open ocean between islands, and has been reported at least 50 km from land. Young Galapagos sharks are found in shallow waters of 25 metres or less. 

The Galapagos shark is known to be a solitary species, but it is sometimes found in loose groups. It is a curious species, and is known to approach swimmers and investigate other disturbances in the water, such as boats and divers. The Galapagos shark can be an aggressive animal, and, like other species of sharks, it performs a display in order to attack its target. This display involves arching its back, raising its head, and lowering its pectoral fins as it swims with a noticeable twisting motion. 

The Galapagos shark usually hunts near the bottom, feeding on bottom-dwelling fish, but it is also been known to feed on prey from the surface. The fish it preys on include eels, flatheads, groupers, flatfish, and triggerfish. It also feeds on squid and octopuses. In the Galápagos Islands, off the coast of Ecuador, the Galapagos shark has been observed to feed on sea lions and marine iguanas. Occasionally, a large Galapagos shark may feed on other sharks. 

Galapagos sharks are viviparous, or livebearing, with embryos nourished by a yolksac-placenta during gestation. Mating and birth occurs early in the year within Hawaiian waters. Female individuals often have mating scars from males biting the gills, fins, and body. Each litter contains 6 to 16 pups, each being 60-80 cm long. The pups stay in shallow waters to avoid predation and cannibalism from members of their own species, eventually moving out to deeper waters as they mature. Galapagos sharks do not reproduce until the age of 10 years, with the maximum known lifespan for a Galapagos shark being approximately 24 years. 

According to the International Shark Attack File, the Galapagos shark has been responsible for one fatal attack on a swimmer in the Virgin Islands. In locations where this shark is common, they often are attracted to divers, sometimes even becoming an obstacle. When divers take aggressive actions, these sharks are not discouraged, but instead become more excited. The Galapagos shark has been reported to display threat behaviors including arching of the back, raising the head, and lowering the caudal and pectoral fins while swimming in a twisted, rolling motion.

This species is considered potentially dangerous and may attack if a food source is present, such as during spearfishing activities. If there are large numbers of Galapagos sharks present, it would be wise to limit one's activities in the water. 

The Galapagos shark is currently listed as Near Threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, the Galapagos shark might be listed as Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered in the near future. In Australia and the western Pacific Ocean, the Galapagos shark is considered "Data Deficient" due to a lack of information on populations in this region. However, there is a marine reserve that surrounds this species' range off Lord Howe Island and the Kermadec Islands (New Zealand), where it is not considered to be under threat. 

Abell 2029

Abell 2029 or A2029 is a large cluster of galaxies 1 billion light years away in the constellation Virgo. 

Its central galaxy, IC 1101, is the largest galaxy known. Estimates ranging from 5.6 to over 6 million light years across. Contrast this with the Milky Way, which is 200,000 light years across. 

A2029 is also about 81 times bigger than the Milky Way, with a luminosity of 2 L. This type of galaxy may have grown to its large size by accreting nearby galaxies.


Ski bindings

Ski bindings keep ski boots connected to skis. The first ski bindings were ropes connect to the ski. People put their boot under the rope.

There are different ski bindings for alpine skiing and Nordic skiing. Alpine ski bindings connect the bottom of the ski boot to the ski. Nordic ski bindings connect the toe of the ski boot to the ski.

Ski boots

Ski boots are boots people wear when skiing. They cover the ankle and are rigid. Ski boots are connected to skis by ski bindings. They are made from synthetic materials. Ski boots keep the feet of skiers warm. 

Before the 1900s, people used normal boots for skiing. The first boots for skiing were made by military people fighting in the Russo-Finnish War. 

The front of Nordic ski boots connect to the ski at the toes.

Padmé Amidala

Padmé Amidala is a fictional character in the fictional "Star Wars" universe. She is the secret wife of Anakin Skywalker and the mother of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa. She is played by actress Natalie Portman in the prequel trilogy.

In "The Phantom Menace", Padmé is the fourteen-year-old queen of the planet Naboo. In the movie, Amidala gets captured by the evil Trade Federation, meets the young slave boy Anakin Skywalker, and takes her captured planet back from the Trade Federation.

In "Attack of the Clones", Padmé is not the queen anymore; she is now an adult, and a Senator. She and Anakin Skywalker fall in love though she said it would make them live a lie. Even though Anakin is a Jedi, and Jedi aren't supposed to get married, Padmé and Anakin got married anyway.

"Revenge of the Sith" is the last movie Padmé is in. She is going to have a baby, and her husband Anakin dreams that Padmé will die when she has the baby. Palpatine, a man that Anakin trusts, tells Anakin that he can save Padmé with the evil Dark Side of the Force. So Anakin goes to the Dark Side but little does he know that the power to save people from death was achieved by a jedi not a sith. He goes to a lava planet called Mustafar, and his master Obi-Wan Kenobi, along with Padmé, follow him there. Anakin, who has turned to the Dark Side, thinks that Padmé had got Obi-Wan to come with her (she had not). Anakin chokes Padmé using the Force and she blacks out and crumples to the floor.

Padmé is taken a little later to a hospital, where she gives birth to twins. Soon afterwards, because Anakin broke her heart which no none except her and Obi-Wan Kenobi knew, finally telling Obi-Wan with her last breath that she knows there's still good in Anakin, she dies.

River system

A river system is sometimes called a drainage system. It is the whole natural water system in a drainage basin.

Water in a drainage basin usually ends up in the sea, but there are places where the water just evaporates, or flows into an inland lake. Lake Chad, for example, is an example of an endorheic lake, which has no outlet to the sea.

Rivers are an important feature of most landscapes, acting as the principal mechanism for the transport of weathered debris away from upland areas and carrying it to lakes and seas, where much of the classic sediment is deposited. River systems can also be deposition, accumulating sediment within channels and on floodplains. 

Water flow in rivers and streams is normally confined to channels, which are depressions or scours in the land surface that contain the flow. The floodplain is the land that is covered when the river is in flood. Together the channel and over bank settings comprise the "fluvial environment". 

Battle of Buxar

The Battle of Buxar was fought on 23 October 1764 between the forces of the British East India Company led by Hector Munro and the combined army of Mughal rulers.

The Mughal forces were drawn from 2 princely states, whose rulers were Mir Qasim, the Nawab of Bengal, and the Mughal King Shah Alam II.

The battle fought at Buxar, then within the territory of Bengal, a town on the bank of the Ganges river about 130 km west of Patna, was a decisive victory for the British East India Company.

The combined Mughal forces numbered about 40,000 men, Monroe's forces numbered about 10,000 men, of whom 7,000 were regular British Army men seconded to the East India Company. Reports of the battle say that lack of co-ordination between the various Mughal forces was the main reason for their defeat.
The Causes for the battle of Buxar was the:
1. Conflict with the company :- Mir Qasim proved himself as a capable ruler .He attempted to improve the finances of his region. He raised his army on modern lines

The fate of the three defeated Mughal leaders varied. Shah Alam was forced to pay a fine of five million rupees. After negotiation, the Treaty of Allahabad was signed. All his pre-war possessions were returned except for the districts of Karra and Allahabad. He became a pensioner, with a monthly pension of 450,000 rupees. The Company later restored Allahabad to him. The Company got revenue authority (Diwani rights) for almost 100,000 acres of land in the modern states of West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh, as well as in the neighbouring areas of Bengal.In return mughal emperor was given 26 lakh rupees.The Company's main aim was not to rule India, but to increase their revenue resources and expand trade throughout the country.Taxes were collected for them by a Company-appointed deputy-nawab.nawab was to pay an indemnity of rupees 50 lakh

Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula was restored to Oudh, with a subsidiary force and a guarantee of defence. Mir Qasim, the Nawab of Bengal, was ruined by the defeat. He had been the prime mover in the war, but afterwards he was deposed by the Company and rejected by Shuja-ud-Daula.

The arrangements made the British East India Company the virtual ruler of Bengal, since it already possessed decisive military power. All that was left to the Nawab was the control of the judicial administration. But he was later forced to hand this over to the Company in 1793. Thus the company's control was virtually complete.

In spite of all this the East India Company was again on the verge of bankruptcy, which stirred the British to make a fresh effort at reform. On the one hand Warren Hastings was appointed with a mandate for reform; on the other an appeal was made to the British state for a loan. The result was the beginnings of state control of the Company, and Warren Hastings was appointed Governor-General of Bengal from 1772 to 1785.

Suffragette

A suffragette was a woman in the early 20th century who believed they should have the right to vote (suffrage). This movement happened in the United Kingdom and United States. 

For many years women were not allowed to vote, and so they fought for their rights. In their protests, they ended up getting arrested. In 1913 Emily Davison died for the cause. In the UK, women over 30 got the right to vote in 1918. This was lowered to 21 in 1928. Similar struggles went on in all the English-speaking countries.

Technical writing

Technical writing is communication about technical and occupational fields. The Society for Technical Communication (STC) defines technical writing as any form of communication that is: 

The audience is a vital part of the writing. If, say, writing medical instructions to help patients and care-providers, the writing might be for doctors & nurses; lay people with a good general education; or poorly-educated people. The writing would be quite different in each case. For example:

Technical writing communicates visually as well as verbally. A communication should follow an overall logic. One approach is descriptive, such as "Parts of a car engine". Another is the problem-solver: "How to change tyres". Practical encyclopedias usually inform and have how to do it sections. Medical encyclopedias are a good example. A medical encyclopedia provides information to readers about health questions.

People have always needed how-to guides, which appeared in manuscripts before the arrival of print.

John Cale discography

Multi-instrumentalist

A multi-instrumentalist is a musician who plays two or more musical instruments. Many professional musicians aim to become multi-instrumentalists.

In an orchestra, a number of musicians might each play a variety of different instruments during a single performance. Orchestras will also often, but not always, ask for several members of the woodwind section to be multi-instrumentalists. This is sometimes referred to as doubling. Typically, for example, one flute player in the orchestra will switch to playing the piccolo or alto flute when called to by the score. If an orchestra is playing a piece that needs "two flutes and a third flute doubling piccolo", it means that the third flautist also has a piccolo. Sometimes he or she will need to put the flute down and play the piccolo, then perhaps swap round again.

An oboist may sometimes double on the cor anglais, a clarinettist may sometimes double on a bass clarinet, and a bassoonist may double on a contrabassoon. At other times such instruments may need a separate player. At the beginning of a musical score there should be a list of instruments that makes it clear how many players are needed.

Jardin des Plantes

The Jardin des Plantes is the main botanical garden in France. It is one of seven departments of the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle. It is on the left bank of the river Seine and covers 28 hectares (280,000 m²).

There is a school there that trains people to be botanists respecting biodiversity. There is a zoo in the Jardin that was started during the French Revolution from the animals at Versailles. The garden was started in 1626. It was used in 1640 to grow medicinal herbs for the king. Among directors, Comte de Buffon expanded it greatly. Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck, Chair of Botany, changed its name from "Jardin du Roi" to "Jardin des Plantes" during the French Revolution. It helped not to have the name linked to the king.


Class ring

A class ring is a ring worn by students in the United States and Canada to celebrate their graduation. They are most often given out in high schools, colleges, and universities. The first class rings were made in 1835 at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York.

Joint Intelligence Committee

The Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) is part of the British Cabinet Office. It supervises the intelligence organisations of the United Kingdom on behalf of the Cabinet. More generally, it gives advice to the Cabinet on security, defence and foreign affairs.

The JIC sets priorities for the intelligence and security agencies: MI6, MI5, GCHQ, and Defence Intelligence.

The Committee is chaired by a permanent chairman, a member of the senior Civil Service, who is supported by the Intelligence and Security Secretariat and an assessment staff. The assessment staff is made up of experienced senior analysts drawn from across government and the military and conducts all-source analysis on subjects of interest to the committee. JIC papers written by the staff draw input from across the intelligence and security agencies and other related bodies.

Membership is the heads of the three collection agencies—the Secret Intelligence Service, Security Service and GCHQ—the Chief of Defence Intelligence, Deputy Chief of Defence Intelligence Staff, the Chief of the Assessment Staff, representatives of the Ministry of Defence, Foreign and Commonwealth Office and other departments, and the Prime Minister's adviser on foreign affairs.

The JIC has three functions:

The JIC drafts the annual Requirements and Priorities for collection and analysis, for approval by Ministers. These support the strategic national security objectives of the UK:

The JIC was founded in 1936 as a sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. This was the advisory defence planning agencyat the time. During World War II, it became the senior intelligence assessment body in the UK. In 1957 the JIC moved to the Cabinet Office. Its assessments staff prepare draft intelligence assessments for the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.

The JIC is monitored by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament and supported by the Joint Intelligence Organisation.

Ever since World War II, the chief of the London station of the United States Central Intelligence Agency has attended the JIC's weekly meetings. One former US intelligence officer has described this as the "highlight of the job" for the London CIA chief. Resident intelligence chiefs from Australia, Canada, and New Zealand may attend when certain issues are discussed.

George A. Miller

George Armitrage Miller (February 3, 1920 – July 22, 2012) was one of the founders of cognitive psychology in the 20th century. He studied thinking, language, and memory.

Miller found out that if you ask people to remember a list of words or numbers, most people can remember only between five and nine words or numbers. His paper "The magical number seven, plus or minus two" explained this as a limitation in human short-term memory.

Once a behaviorist, Miller moved to cognitive psychology. In 1991, Miller was awarded the National Medal of Science. Miller revolutionized the world of psychology by showing that aspects of the human mind could be observed and tested in a laboratory setting.

Miller was born in Charleston, West Virginia. In 1940 he received his bachelor's degree from the University of Alabama, where he majored in English and speech. In 1946, Miller received his Ph.D. in Psychology from Harvard University. During his life, he taught as a professor at Princeton, Harvard, and Rockefeller University. He died in Plainsboro, New Jersey at the age of 92.

The first concept introduced by Miller is known as chunking. "Chunking" is a way developed to help people remember a certain number of words or numbers. It is known to help with both short-term memory and long-term memory. When he asked subjects to perform memory tasks in various experiments, he noticed that most subjects recalled about seven units from a list regardless of the list topic. Miller said that the short-term memory could only hold 5-9 chunks of information (plus or minus two) and is also a way to increase the capacity of short-term memory. A chunk can refer to digits, words, faces, or any type of meaningful unit. Chunking is when a person groups multiple words together to help with memory tasks. This technique can help people with recalling specific groups of words. Remembering is much easier when the chunking technique is used. An example of chunking would be trying to remember a long sequence of digits. For example, 2 4 5 6 1 4 2 7 0 could be remembered by chunking those numbers into smaller meaningful units such as 245 614 270.

"The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing information" was a paper published originally in "The Psychology Review". This paper remains Miller's most famous and cited piece of work in the history of psychology. It outlines the number of items, numbers, or objects an average human memory can hold. Miller states in his paper, "This number assumes a variety of disguises, being sometimes a little larger and sometimes a little smaller than usual, but never changing so much as to be unrecognizable" (Miller 1956). He did a series of memory tasks that led him to believe that 7 was the number. The paper goes into depth stating how the memory span is a complicated source and how it can hold a lot of information.

Miller began working on Wordnet in the mid 1980s. It is a large database of English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs that are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms which represent a specific concept or idea. It resembles a thesaurus since it groups words together based on their meanings. Miller wanted to use Wordnet as a tool to test psycholinguistic theories on how people use and understand words.

Astrophytum is a genus of cacti. 


GRU

GRU is in the military intelligence service of the Russian Federation, (formerly the Red Army of the Soviet Union).

"GRU" is the English version of the Russian acronym ГРУ, which means Main Intelligence Directorate.

The GRU is Russia's largest foreign intelligence agency. In 1997 it had six times as many agents in foreign countries as the SVR (The SVR is the successor to the KGB's foreign operations directorate). The GRU commanded 25,000 Spetsnaz ('special') troops in 1997.

The GRU's first predecessor in post-tsarist Russia was created on October 21, 1918 under the sponsorship of Leon Trotsky, who was then the civilian overseer of the Red Army. It was originally known as the Registration Directorate ("Registrupravlenie", or RU). In his history of the early years of the GRU, Raymond W. Leonard writes:
"As originally established, the Registration Department was not directly subordinate to the General Staff [of] the Red Army... In 1921... it was elevated in status to become the Second (Intelligence) Directorate of the Red Army Staff.
It was given the task of handling all military intelligence, particularly the collection of intelligence of military or political significance from sources outside the Soviet Union. The GRU operated residencies all over the world. They ran with the SIGINT (signals intelligence) in Cuba, and throughout the former Soviet bloc countries, especially in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.

The GRU was well known in the Soviet government for its fierce independence from the rival "internal intelligence organizations", such as NKVD and KGB. At the time of the GRU's creation, Lenin infuriated the Cheka (predecessor of the KGB) by ordering it not to interfere with the GRU's operations. Nonetheless, the Cheka infiltrated the GRU in 1919. This planted the seed for a fierce rivalry between the two agencies, which were both engaged in espionage. The rivalry was even more intense than that between the FBI and CIA.

The existence of the GRU was not publicized during the Soviet era. Documents about it became available in the West in the late 1920s, and it was mentioned in the 1931 memoirs of the first OGPU defector, Georges Agabekov. Walter Krivitsky, the most senior Red Army intelligence officer ever to defect, described it in detail in his 1939 autobiography ("I was Stalin's agent").

It became widely known in Russia, and the West during perestroika. Viktor Suvorov (Vladimir Rezun), a GRU agent who defected to Great Britain in 1978, wrote about his experiences in the Soviet military and intelligence services. According to Suvorov, even the General Secretary of the CPSU could not enter GRU headquarters without going through a security screening.

The GRU is still a very important part of the Russian Federation's intelligence services, especially since it was never split up like the KGB. The KGB was dissolved after aiding a failed coup in 1991 against the then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. It has since been divided into the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) and the Federal Security Service (FSB).

The GRU was officially dissolved on 7 May 1992. It continues as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces.

Protective gear in sports

Protective equipment helps sport people not get hurt. They use it in skiing, inline skating, skateboarding, snowboarding, and other sports. Types of protective equipment for these sports include wrist guards. Inline skating protective equipment includes a helmet, knee pads, elbow pads, and wrist guards. Skiing protective equipment includes helmets, and release bindings. Snowboarding protective equipment includes wrist guards.

Protective equipment for Australian rules football includes headgear.

Mobility aid

Mobility aids (or orthopedic aids) are devices that are designed to help people walk or move better. They can make people hurt less and feel less pain. An example is a wheelchair.

There are two types of orthopedic aids. One type means people can move part of the body less. The other type means people put less weight on their feet. Splints, knee braces, shoe adjustments, position aids and abduction casts are orthopedic aids.

Children with a disability are two times more likely than children who do not have a disability to use an orthopedic aid.

In Croatia, health insurance pays for orthopedic aids for people less than 18 years old, or people who got hurt while working.

Athelred was the fourth son of King Athelwulf and his wife Osburga. She was the daughter of Oslac, Athelwulf's butler. While his father was in Rome and France, 855-856, his oldest brother Athelstan had died. Prior to his death two years later Athelwulf left a will. in that will the two eldest sons, Ethelbald and Ethelbert should have the kingdom. When Ethelbald died in 860, Ethelbert became the king of Wessex. But their father's will had made no provision for Athelred and Alfred, the two youngest sons, to be kings. Possibly for that reason Ethelbert did not appoint his brother Athelred King of Kent. He consolidated everything into the single kingdom of Wessex. In 865 Vikings raided into Kent and the men of Kent agreed to pay them ransom. But the Vikings the eastern part of Kent despite the pending treaty.

Athelred had not expected to reign, but when his brother Ethelbert died in 866, Athelred became the king of Wessex. This was just after the arrival of the Great Heathen Army in East Anglia. For a time they were more interested in Northumbria. They gained control of York and moved south into Mercia then made their winter camp in Nottingham.

It was at this time his younger brother Alfred was given the title of "Secundarius" (Latin for secondary). This meant he was appointed as heir to the throne. In 868 Burgred, the King of Mercia, asked King Ethelred and Alfred for their help against the Danes (Vikings). When the Danes saw the combined English army against them they asked for peace. The Vikings withdrew to York where they managed a completely defeat. The next year, 871, the great Viking army grew much larger. They moved on Reading. Ethelred with his brother Alfred arrived with their army to meet the new threat. In the battle that followed, the Battle of Reading, both sides suffered many casualties. Athelred's army was defeated. Four days later the two armies met again at the Battle of Ashdown. This time the West Saxons won the victory and the Vikings retreated to Reading. Two weeks later Athelred and Alfred led the West Saxons against the Danes at Basing where the Danes won. Two months passed without any fighting between them. The next battle was at a place called Merantun. After a day long battle which the English were winning, the Danes were able to regain their lost ground. Just after mid-April in 871, 
Athelred died. He was buried at Wimborne Minster. He was succeeded by his younger brother Alfred.

His wife's name is not known (see note a below). He had two sons:

While silage can be stored in many ways, the typical silo is a tall cylinder. It usually has a cone or dome cap on top. There is an opening at the top to put silage in, and doors running down one side to take it out. Originally a farmer would climb the outside of the silo to the top of the silage, go inside, and shovel out the silage. There is typically a chute on the outside, and the silage would fall down the chute, where it could be gathered and fed to the cows. Now there is machinery that does that job.

Its drainage basin, sometimes called the Orinoquia, covers , with 76.3% of it in Venezuela and the rest in Colombia. The Orinoco and its tributaries are the main transport system for eastern and interior Venezuela and the llanos of Colombia. 

The Orinoco Basin is also ecologically important. It is the only habitat of the Orinoco crocodile. This is one of the rarest reptiles in the world, with fewer than 250 living in the wild. It is also home to Amazon river dolphins.

The mouth of the Orinoco was recorded by Christopher Columbus on 1 August 1498. Its source, however, was first explored by non-native people in 1951, 453 years later. It was explored by a French and Venezuelan team. 

The delta, and tributaries in the eastern llanos such as the Apure and Meta, were explored in the 16th century. They were explored by German expeditions under Ambrosius Ehinger and his successors. Alexander von Humboldt explored the basin in 1800. He reported on the river dolphins, and wrote extensively about the plants and animals he found.

The course of the Orinoco forms a wide arc that surrounds the Guiana Shield. The source of the river is at Cerro Delgado-Chalbaud, in the Parima Mountains. This is on the border between Venezuela and Brazil, at high (). The river can be divided into four stretches:


At its mouth, the Orinoco forms a wide delta that branches off into hundreds of rivers and waterways. They flow through of swampy forests. At its widest, this delta is about large and at its widest. In the rainy season, the Orinoco can swell to a breadth of and a depth of .

Off the coast of the delta is Trinidad and Tobago, which is separated from the mainland by the Columbus Channel.

Most of the important rivers in Venezuela are tributaries of the Orinoco. The largest are the Caroní, which joins it at Puerto Ordaz. The river is actually connected to the Amazon River through the Casiquiare canal. This is a distributary of the Orinoco, flowing into the Rio Negro and then the Amazon. This connection forms a natural canal between Orinoco and Amazon.


Boats can travel on the river for most of its length. Ocean ships can travel as far as Ciudad Bolívar, upstream. River steamers carry cargo as far as Puerto Ayacucho.

There is a rich iron ore deposit in the Orinoco delta. It was found in 1926, south of the town of San Felix on a mountain named "El Florero". Mining there began after World War II. At the start in the early 1950s, about 10,000 tons of soil with ore in it was being mined each day.

There are also tar sands in the Orinoco Belt, which may be a source of future oil production.

The original play "Salomé" was written by Oscar Wilde in November and December 1891 in French. Hedwig Lachmann translated the play into German. Richard Strauss saw the play and decided in 1902 to make an opera out of it. The opera was first performed in Dresden in December 1905. "The Dance of the Seven Veils" is a famous excerpt from the opera. It is sometimes performed in concerts.

The opera was very successful; Strauss made so much money with "Salome" that he could afford to buy a beautiful house in the town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The opera also caused a long-lasting scandal after it was first produced in Dresden. At the Vienna Court Opera the work could not be performed for nearly twenty years because of censorship, at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden the opera had to be modified, in New York there was only one performance - then the wealthy donors of the Metropolitan Opera decided that this opera was not suitable for the American public. 


Herodes is the King of Judea and he has thrown a wild party at his palace. The action takes place at the palace on a terrace outside the banqueting hall. Herodes, his wife Herodias, and her daughter Salome are all inside the banqueting hall when the opera starts. Narraboth, the captain of Herodes’s guards, is madly in love with Salome. But his friend, Herodias’s servant, is concerned. The moon looks strange, which he believes is a sign that something terrible will happen, especially if Narraboth keeps staring at Salome. Some Jews cause an uproar in the hall and the guards scoff at their religion but suddenly, there is a voice from a deep pit with a cover on it. Some of the guests outside ask the guards who it is and they answer: This is Jokanaan, a prophet from the desert. Nobody knows exactly what he’s saying, but Herodes has forbidden anyone from seeing him. 

Salome gets offended by some of the party guests and rushes out of the hall. She calls them names in return but she stops as the prophet starts saying more strange things. Salome asks who he is, if he says bad things about her mother, and if he is an old man. They respond that they do not know what he is saying but he is quite young. Salome says that she would like to meet him, but they tell her that she cannot. However, she sees Narraboth looking at her and tells him she may smile at him and give him a flower tomorrow if he lets her see Jokanaan. So he commands the guards to bring the prophet out of the pit as Salome looks on with desire. Jokanaan sees her staring at him, so he asks who she is. When she responds, he is shocked and demands that she get away but she is still infatuated. In turn she praises his pale skin, his black hair, and his red lips. Each time he tells her to get away from him. She turns around and insults those same features but on the third time, she insists that she wants kiss his lips. Narraboth begs her to stop, but she does not hear him and he kills himself. Jokanaan curses her and returns to the pit. 

Herodes comes outside asking where the Princess is when all of a sudden he notices the Moon. Herodias follows him out and dismisses him, urging him to come back inside. However, Herod wants to stay outside with Salome. He notices Narraboth’s body and comments that he did not order the man to kill himself, but he always saw him looking at Salome with desire. He orders his body to be taken away as he feels a very cold wind and hears a sound like the huge wings flapping. Herodias thinks he is sick but Herodes responds that Salome is the one who looks like she has never been sicker. He offers her food, wine, and a seat in her mothers throne, but she responds that she is not hungry, thirsty, or tired. Jokanaan speaks again and Herodias orders the prophet to be silenced. Herodes, however, is worried that something bad will happen to him if something bad happens to Jokanaan, since he is a prophet. Herodias dismisses him again and asks why he does not give Jokanaan to the Jews. They agree with her, but start bickering because they do not believe that he is a prophet. Jokanaan speaks of the “savior of Man.” One of the people suggests that it could be the Messiah, since there is a person around Judea doing miracles, but this just makes them all argue more. 

The scene becomes even more chaotic until Herodes asks Salome to dance for him, promising her anything, even half his kingdom, if she does. She agrees and dances the “Dance of the Seven Veils.” She comes onto the stage wearing nothing but the veils and seductively takes them all off. Herod is very pleased until she asks for her reward: the head of Jokanaan on a silver platter. He is horrified and offers her his best items but she persists. Finally, he gives in. An executioner is sent into the pit, but Salome hears him drop his blade and Jokanaan does not cry out. She is furious, and tells Herodias’s servant that there will be many more dead bodies if she does not get what she wants. Finally, the executioner returns, bearing the bloody head. Salome seizes it and begins to embrace it passionately as the moonlight disappears and reappears. Herodes, fleeing in shock, orders his soldiers to kill her.

By the time he grows up as an adult, Juan later joins the "Kapatiran" (Brotherhood). The Kapatiran is a group that seek to destroy the aswangs. The group then trains Juan into becoming the next "Tagabantay". Later in the story, the "engkantos" and "diwatas" comes to help Juan in his adventures. They have a bigger and important role in the continuing between the aswangs and the humans.



Due to the success of "Juan dela Cruz", the show was given a new series called "My Little Juan". The new series which tells more about Juan's childhood before he was known as the new ""Tagabantay"". The series was first shown on 20 May 2013 and ended on 13 September 2013.


Flag of the Philippines

The Flag of the Philippines has two horizontal bands colored royal blue and red. The blue color symbolizes peace while red is for bravery. It also has a triangle on its left side, which is white in color that symbolizes cleanliness, with an 8-rayed sun and 3 stars, which are all yellow in color. The three stars symbolizes the archipelago's three principal islands, Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The eight rays of the sun of the flag symbolizes the provinces of Batangas, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, Manila, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga and Tarlac. They were the first 8 provinces to be placed under Martial Law by Spain when the Philippine Revolution began since they were the first 8 who have fought against the Spanish colonial rule. The flag of the Philippines when hoisted upside-down shows that the country is at war. The flag was designed by Emilio Aguinaldo.

Bangsamoro Republik

The Bangsamoro Republik, officially the United Federated States of Bangsamoro Republik () was a former unrecognized breakaway territory in the Philippines. All countries consider the Bangsamoro Republik to be part of the Philippines. Nur Misuari, the chaiman of the Moro National Liberation Front declared the independence of the Bangsamoro Republik in Talipao, Sulu. Davao City is declared to be the capital of the state.

It was said to be a federal republic. The government was in exile. According to Misuari, the republic's territory covers the islands of Basilan, Mindanao, Palawan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi. These are places where the Bangsamoro traditionally lived. But according to Emmanuel Fontanilla, Bangsamoro Republik also includes the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak. Fontanilla is Misuari's legal counsel.

Moro National Liberation Front

The Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) is a rebel group in the Philippines. It was started by Nur Misuari in 1969. The MNLF fights against the Philippine government for the independence of the Bangsamoro Land. Over the years there have been several attempts to achieve peace between the MNLF and the government. In 1976 a treaty was arranged by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation but this failed. In 1986 President Corazon Aquino met with Misuari, and in 1989 the area was given a level of autonomy. President Fidel Ramos arranged a peace deal in 1996 which allowed Misuari to be elected as regional governor. Misuari led an uprising against the federal government in 2001, but this failed and he was sent to prison. The MNLF says that the territory of Bangsamoro Land covers Sulu, Mindanao, Palawan and Sabah (in Malaysia). The MNLF is an observer member of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.

Philippine eagle

The Philippine eagle ("Pithecophaga jefferyi") is a bird of prey that can be found only in the Philippines. It is also called the monkey-eating eagle, as well as "agila" ("eagle"), "haribon", "haring ibon" ("king bird") and "banog" ("kite") by the locals. This eagle is known to be the largest eagle in wing surface and length. It is the national bird of the Philippines. The Philippine eagle is protected by law in the Philippines. learning that the Philippine Eagle has been found in danger, it has been made to be the national bird of the Philippines.

Cutting down a large number of trees (Deforestation) is one of the important reasons why the Philippine Eagle is in danger. Scientists have learned that the eagle lives in the eastern Luzon, Samar, Leyte, and that many eagles live in Mindanao. The eagle is known to live a long time, but it is still unknown how long it can live in the wild. The Philippines made this eagle the national bird in 4 July 1995 for a reason - to give attention to this bird. Gaining a lot of attention, the Philippines held events such as "The Philippine Eagle Foundation" in order to save this eagle .   
The people of the Philippines have learned that the Philippine Eagle likes eating flying lemurs and civets . The eagle's known food is only in Mindanao. It is unknown in the eastern Luzon what the eagle eats, because flying lemurs live in the home of Mindanao and are not present in Luzon . The eagle's preferred food can change depending on the time of the season or where the eagle lives. The eagle's preferred animals are mostly animals that live in trees.

Battle of New Orleans

The Battle of New Orleans was the last battle fought in the War of 1812 between the British and the Americans. It involved a series of smaller battles leading up to the main engagement on January 8, 1815. The British had 8,000 infantry in the line out of a total strength of 11,000. The British force was commanded by General Edward Pakenham. The Americans were under the command of General Andrew Jackson. The battle took place at the Plains of Chalmette a few miles from New Orleans.

After the 1793 Treaty of Paris, which officially ended the American Revolutionary War, the British were still present on the American continent. They were trading with the Indians and at times were inciting them against the Americans. The British were blockading American ships, capturing American seamen and forcing them into the Royal Navy to fight against Napoleon. On June 18, 1812, President Madison signed the formal declaration of war against Britain. The fighting began in Canada in an attempt to cut off the British supply lines. At that same time, the British were fighting Napoleon but when that war ended these skilled troops were sent to Canada. The Americans did not have a standing army as such and was still composed of individual militias, men who signed up for short periods of time. By 1813, the British had won nearly every major battle in the war. In August 24, 1814 The British entered Washington D.C., and burned the Capitol to the ground.

On December 24, 1814 the Treaty of Ghent was signed ending the War of 1812. The treaty called for returning all borders and lands as they were before the war. Because of the distances involved and the delay in communications, at the time of the battles neither side knew a peace treaty had been signed.

As the Ghent negotiations suggested, the real causes of the war of 1812, were not merely commerce and neutral rights. They were also the issues of US western expansion, relations with American Indians, and control of the
territory of North America.

The British fleet of some 30 warships sailed out of Negril Bay, Jamaica on 26 November, 1814. The fleet under command of Admiral Alexander Cochrane moved into the Gulf of Mexico ready to attack New Orleans. The fleet was transporting 14,450 British troops who had recently been fighting in the Napoleonic wars in France and Spain. The first the Americans learned of this was through the leader of the Baratarian pirates, Jean Lafitte. The British had offered him several thousand dollars if he would join them. They wanted him to guide them through the swamps in and around New Orleans. Asking for time to consider, Lafitte contacted the American governor of Louisiana, Claiborne and told him of their plans. Claiborne contacted General Andrew Jackson. At first the Americans were wary but they accepted his help. Lafitte offered much needed gunpowder, fuses, cannonballs and the artillery expertise of his men. The pirates knew the swamps around New Orleans and helped guide the Americans to outmaneuver the British.

Andrew Jackson arrived in New Orleans December 2, 1814. He declared martial law and rallied the formerly reluctant citizens to fight the British. Jackson told the people of New Orleans that every citizen was needed to protect the city. He also told them "All those who are not for us are against us". He then blocked all approaches to the City by water.

On December 22 the British moved in barges toward the narrow opening at Lake Borgne. They soon found their way blocked by five American gunboats under the command of Lieutenant Thomas Jones. The British, guided by Spanish and Portuguese fisherman from the area, had an assault force of forty-five boats under the command of Captain Nicholas Lockyer. In the engagement that followed, the British prevailed but suffered about 100 casualties. Lieutenant Thomas Jones lost about 40 killed and wounded. The rest of his men were captured. One man escaped and warned the Americans. The British moved in barges from Lake Borgne to land seven miles below New Orleans on the Mississippi river. Their fishermen guides landed them at Villere Plantation.

When Jackson learned of the landing at Villere Plantation he immediately planned an attack that night. The British general Keene had about 1,900 men when he landed at Villere. More British soldiers landed and by evening there were about 2,300 at the plantation. Under cover of darkness the Americans surprised the British in their camp. Over 2,100 Americans began firing on the British, many of whom were still being landed in boats. The American schooner, "Carolina", had anchored in the Mississippi near the plantation and opened a murderous fire on the British camp. Even after the Americans withdrew the "Carolina" kept up the bombardment until it was blown up by Heated shot and sunk on December 27th. The battle had no clear winner, but the British were delayed in their attempt to capture New Orleans. The Americans lost about 200 men while the British losses were fixed at about 300.

After the battle Jackson began building his defenses at the Rodriguez Canal. This was an abandoned millrace approximately 20 feet wide and 3 to 5 feet deep. It was in a swampy area which gave the Americans a clear advantage. The defensive mill earthworks blocked the British approach to New Orleans. They could only attack from the front as the swamps and river protected the flank. The American position was two miles from the British camp and about five miles below New Orleans. A body of mounted American riflemen kept track of all British movements.

On 25 December General Pakenham landed at the Villere Plantation and took charge of all British forces. The British began moving on 27 December but encountered the American earthworks and halted.

The British were surprised to see the American earthworks. Apparently they had not thought enough of the Americans to even keep an eye on them. In addition to the fortifications in front of them the American cutter "Louisiana" was anchored in the river. As soon as the British appeared the guns of the Americans drove them back. But undaunted they began construction of their own earthworks and setting up their artillery positions.

The British brought up guns from their ships and built earthworks for them under cover of darkness. This was to counter the American guns mounted on their earthworks as well as those on the anchored cutter in the river. On the morning of 1 January 1815 the British opened up with their artillery and rockets. The surprised Americans quickly returned fire but with greater accuracy. Jackson’s line lost two of their guns in the exchange but one by one the cannon fire from the American line took out all fourteen of the British guns. By noon the British had been driven back from their artillery emplacements and the artillery duel was over for the present. Both the Americans and British had placed artillery on the opposite bank of the Mississippi and those batteries exchanged fire most of the afternoon. At night Jackson’s backwoodsmen kept shooting sentries, driving back the pickets and gave the British camp no peace.

Early on the morning of 8 January the British attacked General Jackson’s earthworks. General Packenham’s infantry numbered about 8,000 out of a total force of 11,000. He moved his columns forward while it was still dark to get close to the Americans without being seen. But the element of surprise was lost when a junior officer forgot to bring scaling ladders. When he returned with the ladders it was too late, the Americans could see them. The brigade under the command of General Gibbs attacked the left and center of Jackson’s line. But the American artillery tore large holes in the British line. A regiment of highlanders was sent to help Gibbs but suffered tremendous casualties under the American rifle and musket fire. The British second in command, General Gibbs, was killed on the battlefield. General Pakenham, the overall commander, was shot and killed as he rallied his soldiers. The third in command of British forces, General Lambert, finally called off the assault. The British lost 2,057 men while the Americans lost only 71. The British were veterans of the Napoleonic War and were well experienced and fought bravely but could not break the American defense system.

Fort St. Philip was located on the east bank of the Mississippi river. It protected New Orleans from any river approach to the city. The Americans took over the fort, originally built by the Spanish, in 1808. It was rebuilt with bricks and had two facing the river. The bastions were where most of the fort's twenty guns were mounted. The fort was attacked at the same time General Pakenham led his infantry attack on Jackson's earthworks. The fort was by five British warships for over a week. Finally, on 18 January 1815 the British fleet withdrew. They were damaged but had been unable to do much damage to the fort.

As the gunships retreated on January 18th, the British soldiers were recalled to their transport ships. They were required to leave eighteen badly wounded men, two of whom were officers. In their haste they left fourteen artillery pieces and a large quantity of cannon shot. One of the two medical personnel left to take care of the British wounded gave General Jackson a letter from General Lambert. In his letter Lambert stated he had given up all further operations against New Orleans. He asked too that his men be protected and cared for. Jackson had given thought to pursuing the retreating British. But he decided not to risk any of his men's lives needlessly. He thought the lives of ten British soldiers were not worth the loss of one of his own men.

As General Jackson stated in his letter to the Secretary of War, he was not convinced the British had given up on trying to take the Louisiana territory by force. By Jackson's the British had lost over four thousand men either dead, wounded or who had deserted. Jackson left infantry units to guard the earthworks and the Villere plantation should the British return. He brought the rest of his army back to New Orleans on 20 January 1815.

Tlazolteotl

Tlazolteotl (or "Tlaçolteotl") is an Aztec goddess. She is the goddess of purification, steam bath, midwives, sin and adulterers. In Nahuatl, the word "tlazolli" means vice and diseases. Thus, Tlazolteotl was a goddess of filth (sin), vice and sexual misdeeds. However, she was also a purification goddess. Her dual nature is seen in her epithets; "Tlaelquani" ('she who eats filth [sin]') and "Tlazolmiquiztli" ('the death caused by lust'), and Ixcuina or Ixcuinan ('she of two faces'). Her sisters include Tiacapan (the first born), Teicu (the younger sister), Tlaco (the middle sister) and Xocotzin (the youngest sister).

She is the mother of Centeotl and Yum-Kax, the Maya maize god.

Roman house

In Ancient Rome, several types of Roman houses existed. Those in Rome were of at least three different types ranging from tenements to mansions.

Ordinary people lived in apartment blocks called "Insulae", a kind of apartment building. It housed most people of lower- or middle-class status (the plebs). The wealthiest from the upper-middle class (the equites) had their own homes.

Insulae were of poor quality but had running water and sanitation. Rooms could be owned or rented. They were built in timber, mud brick and later primitive concrete. They were restricted in height to about 20 meters.

Fires and collapses happened. Among his many business interests, Marcus Licinius Crassus speculated in real estate and owned numerous "insulae" in the city. When one collapsed from poor construction, Cicero said that Crassus was happy that he could charge higher rents for a new building than the collapsed one.

Houses of the rich and the upper classes were lavish. The atrium, the most important part of the house, was where guests were greeted. The atrium was open in the centre and was surrounded at least in part by porticoes with high ceilings. It often contained only a little furniture to give the effect of a large space. In the centre was a square roof opening in which rainwater could come and drain inwards from the slanted tiled roof. There were kitchens, bedrooms, a dining room, and a number of open rooms.

The master's office was placed so that the master could see what others were doing. The "domus" was not just a house but was a place of business as well, like McDonalds.

Servants would use a servants' entrance, not the main entrance. Slaves could not leave the house without the permission of the master.

A Roman villa was a Roman country house built for the upper classes. There were two kinds of villas. The "villa urbana", was a country seat in easy reach of Rome or another city. The "villa rustica" was a farm-house estate, like the later English country house, and was occupied by servants who ran the estate.

In the empire, there was a concentration of Imperial villas near the Gulf of Naples, on the Isle of Capri, at Monte Circeo on the coast and at Antium (Anzio). Wealthy Romans escaped the summer heat in the hills round Rome, especially around Frascati (such as Hadrian's Villa). Cicero had at least seven villas. The oldest of them was near Arpinum, which he inherited. Pliny the Younger had three or four of which the example near Laurentium is the best known from his descriptions.

Large villas were important to the Roman economy. They dominated the Po valley, Campania and Sicily and were also found in Gaul. Villas were centres of mining, pottery or horse raising. Villas specialising in shipping olive oil to Roman legions in Germany were a feature of the southern Iberian province of Hispania Baetica. Some luxurious villas have been excavated in North Africa in Africa Province and Numidia. Another example is Fishbourne Palace, in Britannia.

Turquoise-browed motmot

The turquoise-browed motmot ("Eumomota superciliosa") is a bird of the motmot family. It lives in Central America, from south-east Mexico (mostly the Yucatán Peninsula) to Costa Rica. The turquoise-browed motmot is a colourful bird, mostly turquoise, green and orange. It is common and not in danger. It lives in fairly open habitats such as on the edges of forests and scrubland.

The motmots live in the tropical forests of Central America. They are brightly coloured with a strong beak. They have a signature tail with two bare feathers ending in tufts, just like this bird. This effect is got by the tail feathers having no barbs along the middle section.

This motmot has other local names. Itis called "Torogoz" in El Salvador and "Guardabarranco" in Nicaragua. It is the national bird of these two countries.

The Saint of Bleecker Street

The Saint of Bleecker Street is a three-act opera with words and music by Gian Carlo Menotti. It was first performed at The Broadway Theatre in New York City on December 27, 1954. The opera won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1955 and the New York Drama Critics Circle award for best musical. The opera is about a young woman in New York City's Little Italy who receives the stigmata. 

Assemblywomen

Assemblywomen is a satirical comedy by Aristophanes on the idea that women might be better than men at running the state.

The play is about a group of women, and their leader Praxagora. She has decided that the women must convince the men to give them control of Athens, because they could rule it better. The women, in the guise of men, sneak into the assembly and vote the measure, convincing some of the men to vote for it because it is the only thing they have not tried.

The women set up a government in which the state feeds, houses, and generally takes care of every Athenian. They enforce an idea of equality by allowing every man to sleep with every woman, but that the man must sleep with an ugly woman before he may sleep with a beautiful one.

There is a scene in which two men are talking. One of them is going along with the new government, giving his property to the women, and obeying their orders. The other does not wish to give up his property, but he is more than willing to take advantage of the free food.

The following scene has a pair of young lovers unable to make their tryst, as a succession of ever older and more hideous women attempt to and eventually succeed in dragging the man off to make love to him first, as laid down by the new laws.

After the oligarchy put in place after the war fell, Athenians asserted their democracy and equality very strongly. The play makes its point that excessive democracy has its problems.

In the play is what appears to be an exceptionally long word:
Lopado­­temacho­­selacho­­galeo­­kranio­­leipsano­­drim­­hypo­­trimmato­­silphio­­parao­­melito­­katakechy­­meno­­kichl­­epi­­kossypho­­phatto­­perister­­alektryon­­opte­­kephallio­­kigklo­­peleio­­lagoio­­siraio­­baphe­­tragano­­pterygon

In reality it is a series of words stuck together, not a genuine word. It describes a fictional food dish. Liddell and Scott translate this as "name of a dish compounded of all kinds of dainties, fish, flesh, fowl, and sauces". The Greek word contains 171 letters, which far surpasses that of Shakespeare's 27-letter long word, "honorificabilitudinitatibus" in his Love's Labour's Lost V.I.

It is a transliteration of the Ancient Greek word . It is the longest word to appear in literature.

The dish has at least 16 ingredients, including:


Night on Bald Mountain

The music was used in Walt Disney's animated movie, "Fantasia" in 1940. 

Iron deficiency anemia

Iron-deficiency anemia (or iron-deficiency anaemia) is a common type of anemia. It is caused by not having enough iron in food, not absorbing the iron in food, and/or losing iron because of bleeding.

Iron deficiency causes approximately half of all anemia cases worldwide, and affects women more often than men. This is partly because most women have periods (menstruate). There are probably more than one billion people who have anemia.

Anemia is most common in areas like Brazil or Central Africa. Asia, Central America and Eastern Europe are affected too, with North America least affected.

Symptoms include pale skin, tiredness, and weakness.

Anemia can be diagnosed with a blood test by finding out if there is little enough hemoglobin in the blood.

Romeo and Juliet (ballet)

List of figures in Greek mythology

This is a list of gods, goddesses, people and other figures from Greek mythology. They are sorted into sections below. The immortals include gods (deities), spirits and giants. Being immortal means that they live forever. The mortals include heroes, kings, Amazons and other people. The list does not include creatures.

These figures are described by ancient writers, the oldest of which are Homer and Hesiod. The Greeks created images of their deities for many reasons. A temple would house the statue of a god or goddess, or several deities. The statue might be decorated with relief scenes depicting myths. These were also often painted on pottery and minted on coins.

Roman mythology includes many of the same figures, but uses different names: calling Zeus by the name of Jupiter and Aphrodite by the name of Venus, for example. This is called the Venetian creole language. It is called Venetian band.

The main and most important gods were the Twelve Olympians. The home of these gods is at the top of Mount Olympus. There was some variation as to which deities were included in the Twelve. As such, the list below numbers fourteen. It includes all those who are commonly named as one of the Twelve in art and poetry. Dionysus was a later addition; in some descriptions, he replaced Hestia. Hades is not usually included among the Olympians, because his home was the underworld. Some writers, however, such as Plato, named him as one of the Twelve.

The primordial deities are the first beings that existed. They are what makes up the universe. All other gods descend from them. The first among them is usually said to be Chaos. Chaos is the nothingness from which all of the others were made. These gods are usually depicted as a place or a realm. Tartarus, for example, is depicted as the deepest pit in the underworld. His brother Erebus is also depicted as a place of darkness, or the emptiness of space. Gaia is depicted as nature or the Earth. Pontus is depicted as the oceans, lakes, and rivers. Chronos is depicted as time.

The Titans are the older kind of gods in Greek mythology. The original Twelve Titans were children of Gaia (Mother Earth) and Uranus (Father Sky). Their leader was Cronus, who overthrew his father Uranus and became ruler of the gods. Cronus' consort was his sister Rhea. Their children were Zeus, Hades, Poseidon, Hera, Demeter and Hestia. Cronus and the Titans were overthrown by Zeus, his youngest son. They fought a war called the Titanomachy. The Titans are depicted in Greek art less often than the Olympians.

The Giants (, "Gigantes") were the children of Gaia. She was fertilised by the blood of Uranus, after Uranus was castrated by his son Cronus. After the Titans' lost their war against the Olympians, Gaia made the Giants rise up against the Olympians to restore the Titans' rule. The Olympians got help from the hero Heracles to stop the Giants. This war was the Gigantomachy.



These deities lived in the underworld. The ruler of the underworld was Hades, who is listed further above under "Olympians".






Seers were prophets, people who were said to be able to see the future or predict events before they happened.


Land bridge

A land bridge is a term in biogeography. It is a narrow land connection between otherwise separate areas, sometimes called an isthmus. 

Its significance is that animals and plants may cross over it when the sea level is lower. They cannot easily cross when the sea level is higher, and water covers the land bridge. The separation of a once connected population often leads to speciation, the splitting of one species into two and the two species change over time to be different but have distant similarities.

Several kinds of change can cause a land bridge to rise above or sink below the water. Plate tectonics may cause the rise or lowering of land. The causes of general sea level changes are not fully understood, but often big polar ice caps lower sea level by locking up much of the water. When sea levels fall, shallow sections of continental shelf may get exposed. Sometimes the sea floor rises due to "post-glacial rebound" after an ice age.

Invitation to the Dance

"Invitation to the Dance" is a piece of music for solo piano written by Carl Maria von Weber in 1819. It is written in D-flat major in rondo form. It was the first concert waltz. This means it was meant to be listened to rather than danced to. 

In 1841, Hector Berlioz made an arrangement for orchestra. In 1911, the Berlioz version was used for a short ballet called "Le Spectre de la rose". This ballet starred Nijinsky and Karsavina. It became very well known.

Konzertstück in F minor

Concert Piece (Konzertstück) in F minor for Piano and Orchestra, Op. 79, J. 282 is a piece of music for piano and orchestra. It was written by Carl Maria von Weber, and first performed on June 25, 1821 in Berlin, Germany. 

It is one unbroken piece of music with four sections in different tempos. Weber wrote a program for the piece. It tells of a lady and her knight. They are separated by war, but are happily reunited by the end of the music. Mendelssohn played the piece in a concert when he was 18 years old. Liszt and Stravinsky were both influenced by the piece when writing similar works of their own.

Chaperone (protein)

A molecular chaperone is a protein which does things to other proteins. They are mostly concerned with protein folding. 

Some help assemble or take apart other macromolecular structures. They do not occur in these structures when the structures go about their normal functions. 
What they do is:

The first protein to be called a chaperone assists the assembly of nucleosomes from folded histones and DNA. Those assembly chaperones, especially in the nucleus, assemble folded subunits into larger structures such as cell organelles.

One major function of chaperones is to prevent polypeptide chains and subunits sticking together in clumps which do not function. Some chaperones are "holdases" which act to stop aggregation. Others, called "foldases", do help fold proteins which cannot do it themselves. Such proteins violate Anfinsen's dogma, which said protein folding was automatic.

Ribonuclease

Ribonuclease (commonly abbreviated RNase) is a type of enzyme that chops RNA into smaller parts. There are many different versions of the enzyme.

All organisms studied contain many RNases of many different sorts. This shows that RNA degradation is a very ancient and important process.

Thematic map

A thematic map is a kind of map. Different from normal maps, a thematic map is designed to show the distribution of human or natural features or data. The information may or may not be related to geography. For example, a map which shows population is a thematic map.

Thematic maps are called so because they show features relating to a particular theme or aspect of geography.

An early contributor to thematic mapping in England was the English astronomer Edmond Halley (1656–1742). His first important map was a star chart of the constellations of the Southern Hemisphere, published in 1686. In the same year he also published something new, a map of the globe (Earth) in an article about trade winds. This map is sometimes called the first weather map.

Another example of early thematic mapping comes from London physician John Snow. Snow’s cholera map of 1854 is the best known example of using thematic maps for analysis of data. His method anticipates the principles of a geographic information system (GIS). He started with an accurate map of a London neighborhood which included streets and water pump locations. Onto this Snow placed a dot for each cholera death. The pattern centered around one particular pump on Broad Street. At Snow’s request, the handle of the pump was removed, and new cholera cases ceased almost at once. Further investigation of the area revealed the Broad Street pump was near a cesspit under the home of the outbreak's first cholera victim.

Ruggero Leoncavallo

Ruggero Leoncavallo (April 23, 1857 – August 9, 1919) was an Italian opera composer and librettist. He is best known for his 1892 opera, "I pagliacci". In 1906, he toured the United States with success. He was born in Naples, and died in Montecatini Terme, Tuscany.

Pagliacci

I pagliacci or Pagliacci () is a short two-act opera with libretto and music by Ruggero Leoncavallo. It was first performed in the Teatro Dal Verme in Milan, Italy on May 21, 1892. It was conducted by Arturo Toscanini. 

The opera is about an adulterous love affair between the wife of a traveling actor and a village man that ends in the murders of both.

The role of Canio became Enrico Caruso's signature role. "Pagliacci" is the only opera by Leoncavallo still performed. It is usually paired with Pietro Mascagni's "Cavalleria rusticana".

Beorhtric of Wessex

Beorhtric (also Brihtric; meaning 'Magnificent ruler') (died 802) was the King of Wessex from 786 to 802. He ruled Wessex as a king. His wife and father-in-law exercised most of the power. 

The names of his parents and his ancestry are unknown. In 786, Cynewulf, king of Wessex, was killed by Cyneheard, brother of the former King Sigeberht. Either with help of Offa of Mercia or quickly coming under his influence, Beorhtric became King of Wessex. In 787, he held the Synod of Chelsea jointly with Offa. In 789 he married Eadburh, Offa's daughter. That same year Vikings appeared off the coast of Devon. Believing they were traders the local went to meet them and was killed. This was the first encounter with Vikings in southern England.

After Offa's death in 796, Mercian power over England was weakened. There was a period of three years when some West Saxons tried to break free of Mercian control. But Beorhtric and Cenfulf, the new king, signed a peace treaty. From that time on Wessex remained subordinate to Mercia. Three West Saxon coins have survived from Beorhtric's reign. In style they are very similar to coins struck by Offa. They were probably minted at Southampton after Offa's death.

Queen Eadburh, as Offa's daughter, seems to have held all the power in Wessex. She had a reputation for great cruelty. In later years Asser, a scholar at Alfred the Great's court, recorded the story that Beorhtric had died from being accidentally poisoned by his wife, Eadburh. She fled to a nunnery in Francia, from which she was later ejected after being found with a man. It was a good story but probably more myth than real. But she was the reason Wessex would not have another queen for several generations. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that Beorhtric was buried at Wareham in 802. He left no heirs.


American Airlines Flight 191

American Airlines Flight 191 was a scheduled commercial flight from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago to Los Angeles International Airport. The aircraft used was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10. On May 25, 1979, the aircraft crashed into an open field in Des Plaines, Illinois. All 271 people (258 passengers and 13 crew) on the flight were killed. Two people on the ground were killed and five others were hurt. The crash was caused by the loss of one of the engines, which caused damage to the left wing. The loss of the engine happened because of bad maintenance to the aircraft that had been done eight weeks before the crash. It is the worst plane crash to happen in the United States.

The airplane that crashed was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10, tail number N110AA. It was delivered new to American Airlines after its first flight in 1972, and at time of accident it has flown for 19871 hours. It was powered by 3 General Electric CF6-6D engines.

The plane, which just arrived from Phoenix, was assigned to fly Flight 191 from Chicago to Los Angeles. At 2.59pm (local time GMT-6), the plane began its taxi to Runway 32R, and at 3.02pm was cleared to takeoff. However, as First Officer Dillard began to rotate, the number one engine broke off from its pylon on the left wing. With the remaining length of the runway, stopping the plane would be impossible, so the pilots continued with the takeoff, knowing that two engines are enough to fly a DC-10, but not knowing that the engine had completely separated from the aircraft..

Shortly after the engine broke off, the plane began a stabilized, steep climb to 300 ft. The left wing's leading edge slats then retracted, raising that wing's stall speed from 124 knots to 159 knots. The DC-10, travelling at V2 speed (153 knots) then uncontrollably began to roll to the left, as the pilots tried to control the aircraft. The plane reached a maximum bank angle value of 112 degrees left as the nose dropped through 20 degrees below the horizon, and the airplane crashed into an open field in front of an aircraft hangar near a trailer park 4,680 feet northwest from the end of the departure runway, with the left wing hitting the ground first. 

All 258 passengers, 13 crew and 2 others on the ground were killed. This became the worst ever plane crash in the United States, not counting the September 11 attacks which were crashed by hijackers and had more ground fatalities than those passengers killed in the planes.

Erich Loest

Erich Loest (24 February 1926 – 12 September 2013) was a German writer. He also wrote under the pseudonyms Hans Walldorf, Bernd Diksen, and Waldemar Naß. From 1965 to 1975, he wrote eleven novels and 30 short stories, some under pseudonyms. In 1979 he was ostracized from East Germany and did not return until after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1990.

Cynewulf of Wessex

Cynewulf ( 786) was a West Saxon nobleman, a member of the West Saxon , and was King of Wessex from 757 until his death in 786.

Cynewulf was a member of the West Saxon witan. He led that council in expelling Sigeberht. Cynewulf was elected by the witan to rule Wessex in place of Sigeberht. He attested a at the court of King Æthelbald of Mercia. The charter was for Cynewulf to grant land to an abbot in Wiltshire. This indicates Wessex was still a dependency of Mercia. Æthelbald died a few months later. Taking advantage of this Cynewulf took back lands he lost in Berkshire and Wiltshire. Cynewulf was occupied during much of his reign in wars against the Welsh of Dumnonia. He was never able to conqueror Cornwall however. In 779, Cynewulf was defeated by Offa of Mercia at the Battle of Bensington. and Offa then retook Berkshire, and perhaps also London. Despite this defeat, there is no evidence to suggest Cynewulf became subject to Offa (as his successor, Beorhtric was).

In 786 Cynewulf was surprised and killed by Cyneheard, the brother of the king Sigeberht. The entry for the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the year 784 (actual date 786) was: "This year Cyneheard slew [killed] king Cenewulf, and he was there slain, and eighty-four men with him; then Beorhtric succeeded to the kingdom of the West Saxons..." Cynewulf had a long reign of twenty-nine years. He died leaving no heirs.

Muhammed Ahmed

Muhammad Ahmad bin Abd Allah (12 August 1845 – 22 June 1885) was a religious leader of the Sufi Samaniyya order in Sudan. On 29 June 1881, he proclaimed himself as the Mahdi or messianic redeemer of the Islamic faith.

His proclamation came during a period of widespread resentment among the Arabic part of the Sudanese population. They resented the oppressive policies of their Turco-Egyptian rulers (who were also muslims).

There were messianic beliefs among the various Sudanese religious sects of the time. There were earlier Mahdist movements in West Africa, and Wahhabism and other puritanical forms of Islamic revivalism. The root cause of this was the growing military and economic dominance of the European powers throughout the 19th century.

The British influenced the Sudan, and had claimed it as a "Joint Anglo-Egyptian Condominion". In general, the British were behind the rule of the Khedives of the Muhammad Ali Pasha dynasty in Egypt. At the time of the Mahdi, Egypt and the Sudan were ruled jointly by Tewfik Pasha as recognised by the Ottoman Empire, and by the British. Britain's claim to the Sudan led to British forces being sent there after the Mahdi had beaten the forces of the Khedive. The British government appointed General Charles George Gordon ("Gordon pasha") to be Governor General of the Sudan, and that led to his famous death in Khartoum at the hands of the Mahdi's forces.

From his announcement of the Mahdiyya in June 1881 until the fall of Khartoum in January 1885, Muhammad Ahmad led a successful military campaign against the Turco-Egyptian government of the Sudan. The fighting ended with the death of Gordon in Khartoum. After Muhammad Ahmad's unexpected death on 22 June 1885, only six months after the conquest of Khartoum, his chief deputy took over the administration of the Sudan. Churchill says they had by then killed all the people capable of running the country.

The rule of Sudan by the Mahdists turned out badly for its people. Sudan's economy was all but destroyed, and the population had declined by about one-half because of famine, disease, persecution, and warfare. Millions died in the Sudan from the start of the Mahdist state to its fall. None of the country's traditional institutions or loyalties remained intact. Tribes had been divided in their attitudes toward Mahdism, religious brotherhoods had been weakened, and orthodox religious leaders had vanished.

In 1895, the British Government authorized Herbert Kitchener to launch a campaign to reconquer the Sudan. Britain provided men and matériel, while Egypt financed the expedition. The Anglo-Egyptian Nile Expeditionary Force included 25,800 men, 8,600 of whom were British. The remainder were troops belonging to Egyptian units, including six battalions recruited in southern Sudan.

An armed river flotilla escorted the force, which also had artillery support. In preparation for the attack, the British established army headquarters at Wadi Halfa. In March 1896, the campaign started. In September, Kitchener captured Dunqulah. The British then constructed a rail line from Wadi Halfa to Abu Hamad and an extension parallel to the Nile to transport troops and supplies to Berber. Anglo-Egyptian units fought and won various smaller engagements. Eventually, Kitchener's soldiers marched and sailed toward Omdurman.

In Omdurman, on 2 September 1898, the Sudanese leader, now known as the Khalifa, committed his 52,000-man army to a frontal assault against the Anglo-Egyptian force, which was massed on the plain outside the town. The outcome never was in doubt, largely because of superior British firepower. During the five-hour battle, about 11,000 Mahdists died, whereas Anglo-Egyptian losses amounted to 48 dead and fewer than 400 wounded.
Mopping-up operations took several years, but organized resistance ended when the Khalifa, who had escaped to Kurdufan, died fighting in battle at Umm Diwaykarat, November 1899. Many areas welcomed the downfall of his regime.


Sigeberht of Wessex

Sigeberht ( ) was a West Saxon nobleman and . He was King of Wessex from 756 to 757.

This council was led by Cynewulf. This same council then elected Cynewulf to replace Sigeberht as king. Sigeberht was allowed to keep Hampshire and was supported there by the Cumbra. But Sigeberht then killed Cumbra and as a result was driven out of Hampshire. Sigeberht met his end while wandering in the great forest of the , killed by a herdsman. The herdsman killed Sigeberht in revenge for killing Cumbra.

This series of events formed the basis for the story of Cynewulf and Cyneheard. Thirty years later Cynewulf was killed by Cyneheard, the brother of Sigeberht. This was either in revenge for killing his brother or because Cyneheard was about to be expelled from Wessex.

Cuthred of Wessex

Cuthred ( ) was a West Saxon nobleman and . He was King of Wessex from 740 to 756. Cuthred succeeded in restoring much of the of Wessex. 

At the death of King Athelheard, his Cuthred became king. During the time of Athelheard much of Wessex had been lost to King Aethelbald of Mercia. Cuthred made it known he was not as weak a ruler as Athelheard and struggled against Aethelbald being his overlord. In the first three years of Cuthred's rule he warred with Mercia. In 743 Cuthred joined Aethelbald in fighting the Welsh. By all appearances this was a friendly alliance between the two kings. But the friendship soon ended. In 748 Cuthred's son, Cynric, tried to depose his father and died in the rebellion. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the rebellion was encouraged by the Mercian king.

Two years later in 750 Cuthred put down another rebellion by Athelhun, one of his . In the day-long battle, Athelhun had fewer men but was winning until he was severely wounded. In 752, Cuthred again tried to get free of King Aethelbald. This led to a battle at Burford where Cuthred, assisted by a now faithful Athelhun, met Aethelbald and his army. The battle ended up with Aethelbald fleeing the battlefield. From that time on Cuthred maintained independence from Mercia for the rest of his reign. Cuthred died in 756. But he left a much stronger Wessex free of Mercian rule. He was succeeded by Sigeberht.

The name of Cuthred's wife is unknown. His son:

São Miguel Island

São Miguel Island, named for the Archangel Michael (), is also referred to locally as "The Green Island", is the largest and most populous island in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The island has around 138,000 inhabitants and its largest city, and in the archipelago, is Ponta Delgada.

In 1427, São Miguel became the second of the islands discovered by Gonçalo Velho Cabral to be settled by people from continental Portugal.

The first capital of the island was Vila Franca do Campo, which was devastated by a major earthquake and landslides in 1522. The tragedy helped to elevate Ponta Delgada to the administrative and economic status of capital and business centre from 1546.

With the Portuguese Restoration War (1640), the island became a commercial centre, establishing new contacts in Brazil. Some of the island’s historic buildings, including mansions and churches, date from this period; the island's development came from revenues from the export of oranges, mainly to Great Britain.

The period after the Liberal Wars allowed the economy to flourish, and the port of Ponta Delgada expanded, through the export of new crops such as tea, pineapple, and tobacco. The development of the fishing industry, cultivation of staple food and expansion of the dairy industry permitted the growth of many of the towns on the island.

The São Miguel Island has an area of . It is a narrow island; it is long (from southeast to northwest) and wide (from southwest to northeast).

The island, of volcanic nature and subject to activity, presents many mountains, mainly in the interior, dominated by the "Pico da Vara"; those mountains are cut by valleys, gullies and streams - the only waterways because there are not rivers.
The island consists of an ancient in the eastern end, and three stratovolcanoes: Sete Cidades, Fogo and Furnas. The stratovolcano of Sete Cidades is known for its large caldera () of in diameter and of mean depth; in it there are two small lakes ("Lagoa Verde" to the south and "Lagoa Azul" to north).

In the eastern part of the island is the Pico da Vara () - the highest mountain of the island - with of altitude. In the central area, is the Sierra de Água de Pau with 940 m height and on the west lies the Caldeira das Sete Cidades, 850 m altitude.

Lying at the eastern end of the island, Pico da Vara is the focus of a Special Protection Area containing the largest remaining laurisilva forest on the island, which is home to the endemic and critically endangered bird, the Azores Bullfinch.

Its fertile lands produce cereals, tea, grapes (for wine), fruits and food for cattle.

Similar to other islands in the Azores archipelago, São Miguel is influenced by ocean currents and winds, in particular, the Gulf Stream. It functions as a moderating force in the islands, keeping temperatures hovering between throughout the year. Rainfall is distributed evenly throughout the year, although it is most abundant in the cool season. The island's location also makes it susceptible to many Atlantic storms.

The Köppen climate classification subtype for the climate of Sâo Miguel Island, in Ponta Delgada, is Csb (Mediterranean Climate).

Most towns and cities are in plains, some along the coast and a few in the interior of the island. There are several communities within ancient craters (such as Sete Cidades, Furnas or Povoação), river valleys (such as Ribeira Chã, Pilar da Bretanha) or coastal deltas (Mosteiros).

There are two cities in the islands: Ponta Delgada and Ribeira Grande.

The island is divided in six municipalities ():

Power forward (basketball)

Power forward is a position in basketball.  Power forwards play a role similar to that of a center in what is called the "post" or "low blocks". They usually play offensively with their backs towards the basket and position themselves defensively under the basket in a zone defense or against the power forward from the other team in a man-to-man defense.

Planets beyond Neptune

The planet Neptune was discovered in 1846. After this, many people thought that there might be more planets, which are further away from the sun than Neptune. In the early 20th century, Percival Lowell stated that there must be another planet-like body, farther out than Neptune. Lowell said that such a planet-like object could explain some irregularities in the orbits of the gas giants, in particular Uranus and Neptune. The gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed Uranus enough to explain the irregularities. He called it "Planet X".

In 1930, Clyde Tombaugh discovered Pluto. This seemed to validate Lowell's hypothesis. Pluto was officially considered the ninth planet until 2006. There was a problem, however: In 1978, Pluto was found to be too small. Its gravity would be unable to affect the gas giants. This finding triggered a search for a tenth planet. The spacecraft Voyager 2 supplied new measurements in the early 1990s. These measurements showed that Pluto was even smaller than in the 1978 measurement. According to a scientific study published at the time, the error could explain the irregularities observed in Uranus's orbit. After the study had been published, the search was largely abandoned. 

After 1992, the discovery of many small icy objects with similar or even wider orbits than Pluto led to a debate over whether Pluto should remain a planet, or whether it and its neighbours should, like the asteroids, be given their own separate classification. Although a number of the larger members of this group were initially described as planets, in 2006 the International Astronomical Union reclassified Pluto and its largest neighbours as dwarf planets, leaving only eight planets in the Solar System. Pluto was taken as a model for a dwarf planet.

Today, the astronomical community widely agrees that Planet X, as originally envisioned, does not exist. A number of astronomers have used the concept of Planet X to explain other anomalies observed in the outer Solar System. In popular culture, and even among some astronomers, "Planet X" has become a stand-in term for any undiscovered planet in the outer Solar System, regardless of its relationship to Lowell's hypothesis. Other trans-Neptunian planets have also been suggested, based on different evidence.

Beyond the orbit of Neptune, there is a structure called the Kuiper belt. It contains objects called centaurs. Plutinos have also been discovered beyond the orbit of Neptune. Many of these were discovered between 1980 and 1992.

In 2004, the media again talked about the subject, when Sedna was discovered, twice as far from the sun than Pluto. Sedna is not a planet. In 2005, the discovery of Eris was announced. This was called a planet at first; but later reclassified. Today it is the biggest of the dwarf planets. Many other objects were discovered, but none of these is made of solid rock, they more resemble asteroids and comets.

As of 2013, it is possible that a planet outside the orbit of Neptune exists. If it does, it would have to meet the following conditions:

Different hypotheses have been put forward: A hypothetical star, located at about 50,000 AU distance, has been called "Nemesis". Nemesis might be either a red dwarf or a brown dwarf. In the original article, it was claimed Nemesis would orbit the sun at about 95,000 AU. The existence of Nemesis could explain events of mass extinction on earth which seem to occur at intervals of 26 million years. However, its existence is not necessary to explain the extinctions. There are actually fewer brown dwarfs in our cosmic neighborhood than previously thought. Rather than one star for every brown dwarf, there may be as many as six stars for every brown dwarf. The majority of solar-type stars are single.

A hypothetical planet, located in the Oort cloud has been called Tyche. Tyche would be at least as large as Jupiter, and could be up to ten time as large. Originally, it was postulated to be hundreds of times farther than Neptune, at a distance of between 30,000 to 50,000 AU.

In the year 2013, neither hypothesis could be proved.

Jean de Venette

Jean de Venette (circa 1307 – after 1360) was born in Venette, France. He was a chronicler of the Hundred Years' War. He also recorded the events of the Black Plague, the revolt of the Jacquerie, and other historical events that occurred in his lifetime. Venette studied at the University of Paris. He became a Carmelite friar and shared his knowledge with his fellow monks. Jean de Venette realized the importance of education and taught many monks how to read and write. He also wrote a history of the Order of the Carmelites.

Jean de Venette became the Prior of the Carmelite monastery in Paris from 1339 to 1342, and was the Provincial Superior of France from 1341 to 1366. This later title made him the head of all of the Carmelite monasteries in the Province.

About 1340, he began to write down historical events happening around him. He said he recorded them "...in great measure as I have seen and heard them". He describes a great famine that he witnessed at age seven or eight years old. He states it started on the 15th day of March in 1315 and lasted more than two years and ended in 1318."

In that same year of 1340 he describes a great comet that appeared in Gaul. He believed, as did many people in his time, that these events were warnings from God of bad things that would happen.

In 1341, de Venette states Prince John II of Brittany died.

In 1346 he announces that "King Edward of England set sail for Normandy with a great many armed men". 
In 1348, de Venette described the Black Plague and how brave the nuns were that cared for the people. Also how many of them died as a result of their dedication.

He wrote of battles between England and France during the Hundred Years' War where he was so close, "the arrows darkened the sky around him”. Some of these battles he described were the siege of Calais in 1347 and the Battle of Poitiers (1356) where the French King and his son were captured. He gives an account of what happened after Poitiers where he states that there seem to be no rule in the kingdom. He wrote that "thieves and robbers rose up everywhere in the land and the Nobles also robbed and pillaged the peasants and took no thought for the people but rather for their own profit".

He states that in 1356, he witnessed the people of Paris building walls around their city because they did not trust the Nobles to protect them. De Venette goes into great detail, stating that the "citizens placed iron chains across the streets and crossways of Paris". They also built new walls, dug great ditches and tore down houses near the walls whether they were new or old.

Jean de Venette's writings are considered very important because he was an eye witness to many historical events. His writings are detailed and vivid. Many of the other well-known chroniclers wrote about events much later then they actually happened and relied upon one-sided accounts. They were often commissioned by Kings and Nobles who wanted their particular point of view to be stressed.

Jean de Venette died after 1360.

Athelheard of Wessex

Athelheard, also spelled Æthelheard ( 740), was a West Saxon nobleman and . He was the King of Wessex from 726 until his death. He took the powerful kingdom of Wessex left to him by his father, Ine and gained a bit more from Mercia. He was seen as one of Wessex’s most powerful kings. 

In 740, he died probably due to food poisoning & was succeeded by his son, Cuthred.

When Ine stepped down as King of Wessex it caused a problem of succession. Ine's son had been killed rebelling against Ine a year earlier. Ine was now in his sixties and retired to Rome. He 'commended his kingdom to younger men'. It came down to a struggle between the two athelings, Oswald and Athelheard, Oswald was descended from Ceawlin. The same entry calls Athelheard kinsman to Ine. The two fought and Athelheard became king. In one charter Athelheard is called the brother of Ine's wife Atelburh.

In 733 Somerton was lost to King Aethelbald of Mercia. This was quickly followed by the territory beyond Selwood being lost to Mercia. Athelheard's authority was so weak that Aethelbald was able to give the Archbishop of Canterbury a gift of the monastery of Cookham in Berkshire (Wessex). Aethelbald also took Wiltshire, Sussex and much of the heartlands of Wessex. Athelheard could do nothing to prevent this loss. He also took part in Athelbald's wars with the Welsh. It seems Athelbald's wife, Frithugyth, was Mercian herself. In 737 she made a pilgrimage to Rome along with bishop Forthhere of Sherborne. Athelheard died in 740, his successor was his kinsman Cuthred.

He married Frithugyth. They had no known children.


Blurred Lines (song)

"Blurred Lines" is an R&B song by Robin Thicke. It has vocals by Pharrell and T.I. and was produced by Pharrell. It was released on March 26, 2013. It was the lead single from his album "Blurred Lines". It has reached number one in 14 countries. It became Thicke's most successful song, being his first to reach number one on the Hot 100. He had already peaked number 14 in 2007 with "Lost Without U".

"Blurred Lines" sold more than any other single in 2013. It sold over 1.44 million copies.

Two versions of the music video were made. The first version of the video was removed from YouTube for showing topless models Emily Ratajkowski, Elle Evans, and Jessi M'Bengue. In the second version the models are not topless. Several parodies were made. On November 12, the English pop singer Lily Allen released the video for her single "Hard Out Here". It featured Mylar balloons spelling out "Lily Allen has a baggy pussy", spoofing the balloons in Thicke's video saying "Robin Thicke has a big dick".

Thicke wanted the song to sound like Got to Give It Up by Marvin Gaye. Members of Gaye's family have accused Thicke, T.I. and Pharrell of illegal copying. Thicke offered the family a six-figure sum of money to end the lawsuit but they did not accept it.

The song was banned by twenty UK universities. Essex University students started a petition to have the song banned there too. Alice Smart, a Leeds Student Union officer, said, “I’m proud that we’ve taken the decision to stop playing ‘Blurred Lines’ in our bars and clubs because the song undermines real and dangerous issues around consent. Just because the song has been commercially successful doesn’t mean we have to play it knowing that it offends a high proportion of our students.” Thicke responded on "The Today Show" to feminist criticism of the song by saying, "If you listen to the lyrics it says 'That man is not your maker.' It's actually a feminist movement in itself". He also said in an interview with the BBC that criticism of the lyrics by a rape charity is 'ridiculous'.

Thicke has said that he would like to do another song with T.I. and Pharrell.

On December 26, 2013, Rob Sheffield wrote for "Rolling Stone" that "Blurred Lines" was the worst song not just of the year, but of any year.

In December 2013, "Blurred Lines" was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Record of the Year at the Grammy Awards.

The video for "Blurred Lines" was the seventh most watched video on VEVO in 2013.

Arthus reaction

In immunology, the Arthus reaction is a kind of local allergic reaction, when antibodies react to a chemical or protein in a person's blood, and have the antibodies get stuck in the walls of blood vessels in organs such as the heart, in joints, and kidneys.

The Arthus reaction was discovered by Nicolas Maurice Arthus in 1903. Arthus repeatedly injected ingredients of horse blood under the skin of rabbits. After four injections, he found that there was swelling and that the mixture was absorbed slowly. Further injections eventually led to dying of cells.

Arthus reactions have been infrequently reported after diphtheria and tetanus toxoid vaccinations. They are rare and can cause pain, swelling, bleeding, and occasionally death of tissue within 4–12 hours after the vaccine is given.


Installation art

Installation art is a style of visual art that uses three-dimensional objects. These artworks are usually meant to change the perception of a space (the way a space is seen). Installation artworks can be permanent or temporary and are shown in museums, galleries or in public spaces.

Some of the earliest installation artworks were Marcel Duchamp's "readymade" objects. However, the real development started in the 1970s. Today, with the improvement of technology, artists use and mix new medias and may involve sensors too in order to make the visitors interact with the installations.


Joakim Nordström

Joakim Nordström (born February 25, 1992) is a Swedish professional ice hockey centre. He is currently playing for Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has also played in the NHL for the Chicago Blackhawks and in the Elitserien (SEL) for AIK IF.

He debuted in the SEL on 23 September 2010 in a game against Södertälje SK. He was drafted 90th overall by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. On January 5, 2012, he won the gold medal with Sweden during the 2012 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.

On May 29, 2012, he was signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Blackhawks but remained with AIK for the 2012–13 season.

On March 13, 2015, Nordström was suspended for two games for boarding after hitting Arizona Coyotes defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson.

On June 15, 2015, he won the Stanley Cup with the Blackhawks after they defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in six games.

On September 11, 2015, Nordström was traded along with Kris Versteeg to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for a 3rd round draft pick in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft. Nordström and Versteeg were traded because the Blackhawks had to make cap space for Marcus Kruger.

Pentatomidae

Pentatomidae, Greek "pente" meaning "five" and "tomos" meaning "section", is a family of stink bugs. There are about 4,700 species in the family.

In agriculture, many stink bugs and shield bugs are considered pest insects, because they can damage crops, and are not easily killed by pesticides.


Draco (lawgiver)

Draco (7th century BC) , also known as Dracon was the first legislator of the city of Athens in Ancient Greece. He wrote laws that were to be enforced only by a court. This constitution replaced the system of oral law and blood feuding that had ruled Athens since the city was founded. Draco's laws were known for being harsh. The word draconian has come to mean unforgiving rules or laws.

Draco created this legal system during the 39th Olympiad, in about 622 or 621 BC. The laws ( - "thesmoi") he set formed the first written constitution of Athens. They were displayed in public, so that nobody would be unaware of them. The death penalty was the punishment for most crimes, even minor ones. Plutarch states: "It was a lot for himself, when asked why he had fixed the punishment of death for most offences, answered that he considered these lesser crimes to deserve it, and he had no greater punishment for more important ones."

Not much is known about Draco's life or who he was. The 10th-century Suda text tells a legendary story of his death. He was said to have died on the stage of the theatre in Aegina. In a traditional ancient Greek show of approval, his supporters threw so many hats and pieces of clothing onto his head that he suffocated.

All of Draco's laws, except the law concerning murder, were abolished by Solon in the early 6th century BC.


Draco

Draco can mean several things:


Lunar Society of Birmingham

The Lunar Society was an important club in the Midlands of 18th century England. It was a dinner club, and a learned society. Its members were industrialists and inventors, natural philosophers (scientists), and other intellectuals. They met regularly in Birmingham and elsewhere from 1765 to 1813. 

The name arose because the society met during the full moon. The extra light made the journey home easier and safer in the absence of street lighting. The members cheerfully referred to themselves as "lunarticks", a pun on lunatics. Venues included Erasmus Darwin's home in Lichfield, Matthew Boulton's home, Soho House, and Great Barr Hall.

It leading members were Matthew Boulton, Erasmus Darwin, Thomas Day, Richard Lovell Edgeworth, Samuel Galton, Jr., James Keir, Joseph Priestley, William Small, Jonathan Stokes, James Watt, Josiah Wedgwood, John Whitehurst and William Withering. Other great men of the day visited, or corresponded with, the Society. It had no formal membership list, and was flexible in its arrangements. Anyone could be invited.

The club was seriously affected by the Priestly Riots of July 1791, which started in Birmingham, and spread. Some of the Society were personally attacked; Priestley's house was burned to the ground. The causes of the riots are not entirely clear, but for sure the rioters were against "freethinkers and dissenters". They were stirred up by being told that the dissenters were in favour of the French Revolution.

Matthew Boulton

Matthew Boulton FRS (3 September 1728 – 17 August 1809) was an English manufacturer and the business partner of Scottish engineer James Watt.

In the last quarter of the 18th century, the partnership installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines. A great advance on the state of the art, they made possible the mechanisation of factories and mills. Boulton applied modern techniques to the minting of coins, striking millions of pieces for Britain and other countries, and supplying the Royal Mint with up-to-date equipment.

Born in Birmingham in 1728, Boulton was the son of a Birmingham manufacturer of small metal products who died when Boulton was 31. By then Boulton had managed the business for several years, and he expanded it considerably at the Soho Manufactory, built by him near Birmingham.

When Watt's business partner, John Roebuck was unable to pay a debt to Boulton, he accepted Roebuck's share of Watt's patent as settlement. He then successfully lobbied Parliament to extend Watt's patent for an additional 17 years. This enabled the firm to market Watt's steam engine. The firm installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines in Britain and abroad, initially in mines and then in factories.

Boulton was a key member of the Lunar Society, a group of Midlands men in the arts, sciences, and theology. Members included Watt, Erasmus Darwin, Josiah Wedgwood and Joseph Priestley. The Society met each month near the full moon. Members of the Society developed concepts and techniques in science, agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and transport that laid the groundwork for the Industrial Revolution.

Boulton founded the Soho Mint, which he adapted to steam power. He sought to improve the poor state of Britain's coinage. After several years of effort obtained a contract in 1797 to produce the first British copper coinage in a quarter century. His "cartwheel" pieces were well-designed and difficult to counterfeit, and included the first striking of the large copper penny, which continued to be coined until decimalisation in 1971. He retired in 1800, though continuing to run his mint, and died in 1809. His image appears alongside James Watt on the Bank of England's new Series F £50 note.

Peasants' Revolt

The Peasants' Revolt was a rebellion of peasants in England, in 1381. It was the biggest rebellion of farmers in medieval England. 

The Peasants’ Revolt is also called Wat Tyler's Rebellion, after Wat Tyler, who was a local leader of the peasants in the rebellion. It has also been called the Great Rising. 

The causes of the rebellion are unclear today, but there are different candidates:

There were two types of peasants: serfs and free peasants. 

Serfs were tenant farmers who worked without pay for a lord. In exchange, they got permission to live on the lord’s land. They also got protection from the knights living on the lord’s manor. Under feudalism, serfs had many difficulties. They barely had enough food to live on, and they had few possessions. They were not slaves, but they were not completely free. Serfs had less than any of the other social classes in medieval society.

Though they had more freedoms than serfs, life was also difficult for free peasants. Even though they were "free," they were still controlled by the higher social classes. They had to pay rent to live "free." They had to pay for many other things too, like collecting water or getting married.

Most peasants lived in houses which also housed the animals of the village.


Fifty years later, most of Wat Tyler's demands were put into place by the king.

Leas Cliff Hall

Leas Cliff Hall is an entertainment and function venue in Folkestone, on the Kent coast of England.

The Leas Shelter was built in 1894. In 1924, it was decided that a larger hall was needed. 28 months later, the building was finished. It was opened on 13 July 1927 by Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester.

The opening concert was performed by the Folkestone Municipal Orchestra. One thousand people attended.
It was closed for modernisation and refurbishment on 16 September 1980. It re-opened on 6 May 1981 in the form that it is today.

Dirty rap (also called porn rap or dirty hip hop) is a type of music that mixes rap with sexual content. Some notable artists include Plies, Lil Wayne, Lil' Kim, The Notorious B.I.G., Ludacris and Nicki Minaj.

East Coast hip hop

East Coast hip hop is a type of hip hop music that comes from the East Coast of the United States. It originated in New York during the 1970s. East Coast hip hop only became a distinct subgenre after artists from other regions of the United States emerged with different styles.



Food photography

Food photography is art made by taking photos of food. These photos are sometimes used for menus in restaurants, but they can also be used for advertising, or in a cookbook. System catering also needs images of their food. There are a number of techniques that are used when taking pictures of food, for example, when taking pictures of soft drinks, fake ice cubes are put in the drink instead of real ones, because real ice cubes would melt quickly.

Ine of Wessex

Ine (26 March 670 - 728) was a West Saxon nobleman who was King of Wessex from 688 to 726. He established Wessex as a true kingdom by introducing a code of laws. He strengthened the position of the Church in Wessex. He was seen as one of Wessex's greatest & most powerful kings especially his long & successful reign & ahead of his predecessor. That is until Alfred the Great took that title away & made Ine second.

Just like Caedwalla, in 726, Ine abdicated the throne to go to Rome in Italy where he died there 2 years later. He was succeeded by his son, Athelheard.

Ine was the son of Cenred, an of Wessex. Bede says of Ine that he was "an atheling". His brother was Ingild, ancestor of Alfred the Great. His sister Cuthburh was married to King Aldfrith of Northumbria. She was the founder of Wimborne abbey.

The former king, Caedwalla, was one of Wessex's more important military leaders. When he abdicated in 688 it left a power vacuum. Wessex was broken up into several sub-kingdoms. Each was ruled by a underking. Ine many have started as a sub-king but before long was able to establish himself as the sole ruler of Wessex. Ine reorganized Wessex and established a system of shires. He removed the positions of sub-kings, or underkings, and replaced them with . In many respects Ine was the first true king of Wessex.

Ine wrote his laws between 688 and 694 He mentions in the bishop Erconwald who helped him. This is Erconwald who from 675 to 694 was bishop of Essex (London). He was replaced in 994 by Waldhere. But the mention of Ine's father still being alive points to the laws being written earlier in this period rather than later. The laws of Ine are the first set of laws for the Saxons of Wessex. There were earlier law codes in Wessex. But none covered as wide a range of situations as a king or his officers might have to deal with. For the next two centuries there were no law codes written after those of Ine. Not until Alfred the Great was a more extensive law code created.

In 705 the king of Essex was sheltering from Wessex. This created a serious problem between the two kings. But finally the exiles were expelled after a threat by Ine to invade the East Saxon territory. A similar situation occurred in 722 when an exile named Ealdbert was received in Sussex. Ine invaded sussex as a result. In 725 Ine invaded again and this time Ealdberht was killed. 
In 710 Ine was at war with Geraint, king of Dumnonia. This was part of his campaign against the Britons and expanding the borders of Wessex west to the River Tamar. But he was unable to conqueror Cornwall. Ine was defeated by the Cornish in 722 at the Tamar river. All through his reign Ine seems to have been on good terms with the Mercians. There is only one incident; a battle at Wodnesbeorg in 715 between Ine and Ceolred, King of Mercia. But the only source for this informaiton, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not say who won.

Ine was a strong supporter of the Church. While he resisted the creation of a second bishopric at Sherborne, he did support the first bishop there in 705, bishop Aldhelm. Ine supported the creation of an organized church in Wessex. Formerly it was just scattered monasteries and churches. Many of Ine's laws concerned the spiritual welfare of his people. He law required baptism within thirty days of a child's birth, no working on sundays and the paying of church dues at Martinmas. The first synods in Wessex trace back to his reign. The oldest surviving records shows Ine presided over these church councils.

In spite of his power and all the things he did near the end of his long reign he had internal problems. There was among several of the West Saxon athelings. In 721 Ine killed a Cynewulf. For what reason is not clear, but it was at this time Ealdbert fled Wessex. In 722 he was besieged by Ine's queen, Ethelburg at Taunton. The queen's involvement seems to indicate Ealdbert was a member of the family, possibly their son. He escaped only to be killed three years later (see above). Whatever their relationship, Ine seems to have become very tired. In 726 he abdicated the throne and went to Rome. Less than two years later (728) he died there. He stated he was leaving the kingdom "to younger men" and made no attempt to name an heir. He was succeeded by Athelheard.

There is no mention in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of Ine's wife or children. Ine's brother and two sisters are recorded:

Amber alert

An AMBER Alert is a system that warns people about children who have been kidnapped. It started in the United States in 1996. It was named for Amber Hagerman, a nine-year-old girl who was kidnapped and killed in Arlington, Texas. It is a backronym for America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response. Similar systems have been started in other countries, including Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Europe.

AMBER alerts are often shown on electronic message signs on highways. This often causes bad traffic due to drivers stopping to look at the message. They are also shown on television and heard on radio.

AMBER alerts are issued by police organizations in the state that the kidnapping happens in. They have the name and a description of the child who was kidnapped, a description of the person who police think kidnapped the child, and if available, a description and license plate number of the vehicle of the person who kidnapped the child.

Fishbourne Roman Palace

Fishbourne Roman Palace (or Fishbourne Villa) is a huge Roman villa from the 1st century AD, about thirty years after the Roman conquest of Britain. It is near the south coast in the village of Fishbourne, Chichester in West Sussex. It was built on the site of a Roman army supply base built during Claudian invasion in 43 AD. 

The palace is by far the largest known Roman residence north of the Alps. At about 500 feet (150 m) square, it is larger than Buckingham Palace. It is about the size of Nero's Golden House in Rome or the Roman villa at Piazza Armerina in Sicily. In plan it closely mirrors the layout of the emperor Domitian's palace, the Domus Flavia, completed in AD 92 on the Palatine Hill in Rome.

The rectangular palace surrounded formal gardens, the northern half of which have been reconstructed. There were extensive alterations in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, with many of the original black and white mosaics being overlaid with more sophisticated coloured work, including the perfectly preserved dolphin mosaic in the north wing. More alterations were in progress when the palace burnt down in around 270, after which it was abandoned.

One theory is that it was built for Sallustius Lucullus, a Roman governor of Britain of the late 1st century. Two inscriptions recording the presence of Lucullus have been found in nearby Chichester and the dating of the palace to the early AD 90s, would fit. If the palace was designed for Lucullus, then he may have only used it for a few years: the Roman historian Suetonius says Lucullus was executed by the delusional emperor Domitian in or shortly after AD 93.

Eartham Pit, Boxgrove

Boxgrove Quarry, once a gravel quarry, is now a Palaeolithic archaeological site. It is at Boxgrove in the English county of West Sussex. It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

When excavations began in 1983, flint tools 500,000 years old were discovered. At that time this was the oldest evidence of humans discovered in the UK. In 2005 flint tools 700,000 years old were discovered at Pakefield, and in 2010 flint tools at least 800,000 years old were discovered at Happisburgh. However, Boxgrove remains a site of great importance, for many reasons. The tools were found in a largely undisturbed state, "in situ" in their prehistoric landscape. The tools and evidence of the landscape were buried several metres down.

There were many well-preserved animal bones, many flint artifacts, and hominid bones which are among some of the most ancient found in Europe. Several of the animal bones are the oldest found specimens of their species, such as the wing bone of the Great Auk found at the site in 1989. The combination of bones, stone artifacts, and the geology of the landscape gives a very complete picture of the coastal plain as it existed half a million years ago.

Parts of the site complex were excavated between 1983 and 1996 by a team led by Mark Roberts of the Institute of Archaeology, University College London. The site is in an area that features a buried chalk cliff that overlooked a flat beach (which contained a waterhole) stretching around half a mile (1 km) south to the sea.

In 1994 archaeologists unearthed a lower hominin tibia bone at the Boxgrove quarry site. This partial leg bone is dated to between 478,000 and 524,000 years old. Several teeth were also found. These remains were assigned to "Homo heidelbergensis", an early proto-human species which occupied France and Great Britain. Both were connected by a land bridge at the time.

Extra-sensory perception

Extra-sensory perception (ESP) is being able to know things without using the recognized physical senses. 

The study of extra-sensory perception is part of parapsychology. Almost all scientists think of it as pseudoscience.



History of science

The history of science is the study of the historical development of science and scientific knowledge. The English word "scientist" is relatively recent first coined by William Whewell in the 19th century. Previously, people investigating nature called themselves "natural philosophers".

Science is a body of knowledge about the natural world, produced by scientists who observe, explain, and predict real world phenomena. Historiography of science, in contrast, often draws on the historical methods. 

Facts about the natural world have been described since classical antiquity. Ancient Greece is perhaps most famous for its contributions to astronomy and mathematics. Aristarchus of Samos came up with the idea of the Sun at the centre of what we now call the Solar system many centuries before Galileo.
Others, like Thales and Aristotle were interested in the natural world.

Scientific methods have been used since the Middle Ages (Roger Bacon), but the dawn of modern science is often traced back to the early modern period and in particular to the scientific revolution that took place in 16th- and 17th-century Europe. Important figures in the development of modern science include Isaac Newton, Johannes Kepler, Robert Boyle, Charles Darwin, Wilhelm Roux and Albert Einstein.

Scientific methods are so fundamental to modern science that some consider earlier inquiries into nature to be "pre-scientific". Traditionally, historians of science have defined science sufficiently broadly to include those inquiries.

The natural sciences are these:

There are various applied sciences which depend on one of more of the natural sciences. Medicine is an example.

Social isolation

Social isolation is having little or no contact with society. It often comes from being rejected by society. It is different to loneliness, which comes from a temporary lack of contact. Social isolation is different because it lasts a long time and is done on purpose. Social isolation sometimes begins early in life. It is often caused from being unemployed, sick or discriminated. Anybody of any age can be affected.

Social isolation can mean staying home alone for a long time. Not seeing or speaking with anybody, even on the phone - this includes not answering if the call or try to talk first. Social isolation can also mean not having relationships, friendships or family connections that last a long time.

The reasons for social isolation can begin at any stage in life, including early childhood. Growing up brings many emotions that are hard to deal with, this can cause people to stop sharing all of their feelings, which makes them feel alone from a young age.

Older people are more likely to be affected by social isolation. This can be because with old age health of both the mind and the body get worse, making it harder to be in contact with society; old people are also more likely to not have a lot of money which can cause problems. Also, death of loved ones comes with old age, this doesn’t only make their social circle smaller, but also makes it more difficult for them to socialise again, as it can be emotionally painful.

Some data shows that Gay, Lesbian and Transgender people are more likely to be socially isolated because they are less likely to have children and start their own family and because they might no longer be accepted by their relatives and friends because of homophobia.

Social isolation in people might have gone up because more and more people are starting to live alone, as it is becoming normal in the modern world after the middle of the 20th century. However, it is important to not confuse living alone and feeling lonely as social isolation – they can just be causes.

There are many more reasons for people to stop contact with society:


Social isolation can affect people of all ages, but signs are different for different ages. If social isolation lasts for long periods of time, similar a serious illness, it can cause many bad effects such as loneliness, low self confidence and fear of other people. It can be both an effect and also a cause for illnesses of the mind such as depression and anxiety.

People’s personal lives are affected too – relationships with loved ones may fall apart, this can lead to feelings of guilt and shame. Those feelings can lead to serious illnesses such as depression. When people realise that they are socially isolated, sometimes they have feelings of extreme nervousness, which may make them isolate even more.

A study from 2013 found that social isolation can cause death just as much as “smoking, obesity, elevated blood pressure, and high cholesterol” because social isolation badly affects health. Social isolation can cause stress, unhealthy eating and lower people's wishes to take care of themselves; in extreme cases these things can lead to death.

Social isolation has also been shown to physically change the brain. Studies have shown that it changes the part of the brain for learning and memory. Social isolation also changes the brain’s ability to produce different chemicals that impact mood, it makes it difficult for the brain to produce chemicals that make people happy - Dopamine.

Scientists do not agree on if the internet changes how social isolation can affect us, there is a high level of disagreement because this is a new topic to research. However, studies have found that internet use did not have a bad effect on people’s social circles, in fact, using the internet made people’s social circles bigger and friendships closer, making social isolation less likely. Talking using the internet makes communication easier by removing barriers such as not being able to walk outside because of an illness, because of this it can lead to lower levels of social isolation.


Runaway (dependent)

A runaway is a child or minor who has left their parents or legal guardians without permission. A person who runs away usually does so because of problems in the family. Girls run away more often than boys. 

It looks like the following makes children run away most often: 


In 9 out of 10 cases (89%), other children give a child the idea to run away. 

When the runaway children were asked, half of them said, that at least one parent had a problem with alcohol; a third said, at least one parent was addicted to drugs.

Running away will cause problems for the child: About half of the children that run away will no longer go to school. These children also have a higher risk of becoming criminals, or victims. Most will become homeless. They have a high risk of becoming addicted to drugs, of catching sexually transmitted infections, of having an unwanted pregnancy, of suffering from depression, of trying to commit suicide, and of being exposed to sexual exploitation. Post-traumatic stress disorder is more common in runaway youths. Trauma generally begins with runaway youth's experiences within the family and is increased by prolonged traumatic events. The likelihood of depression among female runaways is related to family conflict and communication. Depression in male runaways is typically related to the father being an alcoholic and poor family relationships. Negative interactions within the family appear to greatly influence depressive symptoms for both genders.

Water pollution

Water pollution is the pollution of bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, seas, the oceans, as well as groundwater. It occurs when pollutants reach these bodies of water, without treatment. Waste from homes, factories and other buildings get into the water bodies and as a result water gets polluted.

Water pollution is a problem for the species and ecosystems there. It affects plants and organisms living in the water. In almost all cases the effect is damaging not only to individual species and populations, but also to the wider biological communities. The color is usually green or brown but normal water can be blue.

Agriculture is one of the major sources of water pollution. The fertilizers given to the crops for better growth are washed into rivers and lakes, which in turn pollutes the water.

There are many chemicals that are naturally found in these bodies of water. Today water may be polluted by nitrates, phosphates, oil, acid rain, and debris such as sediment, fallen logs and so on. When people and animals drink water from such rivers, the poisonous chemicals may affect them. Life in rivers is also affected, and humans who consume fish may also have health problems.


Treaty of Ghent

The Treaty of Ghent was the peace treaty that ended the War of 1812 between the United States of America and the United Kingdom. It was signed on 24 December 1814 in the Flemish city of Ghent. The treaty restored the borders of the two countries to the line before the beginning of the war.

The treaty was ratified by Parliament on 30 December 1814. It was signed into law by the Prince Regent (the future King George IV). An American army under Andrew Jackson scored a major victory at the Battle of New Orleans in early January 1815. The Treaty was not in effect until it was ratified by the U.S. Senate (unanimously) in February 1815.

Heated shot

Heated shot is the heating of round shot before firing from muzzle-loading cannons. The purpose is for setting fire to enemy warships, buildings, or equipment. 

The use of hot shot dates back centuries. It was stopped when vessels armored with iron replaced wooden warships in the world's navies. It was a powerful weapon against wooden warships, where fire was always a hazard. It was mainly used on shore batteries and forts, due to the need for a special furnace to heat the shot. 

The use of heated shot from a ship was so dangerous, that it was against Royal Navy regulations. The American ship USS "Constitution" had a shot furnace installed, for hot shot to be fired.

Fan death

Fan death (Korean: 선풍기 사망설) is a widely-held belief in Korea that leaving an electric fan on overnight will kill a person. However, no people are known to have been killed by this.

The supposed cause of death is often said to be carbon monoxide poisoning, although this is impossible because an electric motor does not create carbon monoxide. Another supposed cause is asphyxiation, which is also impossible because a fan does not remove any air from a room. Hypothermia is also said to be the cause, although it too is impossible because a fan does not lower the temperature of the body enough to cause hypothermia.

Caedwalla of Wessex

Caedwalla, also spelled Cædwalla (c. 659–689), was the King of Wessex from until his abdication in 688. His name comes from the British name Cadwallon. He was a powerful king and war leader. It was through his efforts that Wessex rose to become the third kingdom, after Northumbria and Mercia, in what would become the seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of the heptarchy. Caedwalla was a pagan king who fought for and promoted Christianity.

Caedwalla was born . He the son of Cenberht (Coenbryht) and the brother of Mul. They were of the royal house of the Gewissae. Caedwalla was a descendant of Cerdic. His father, an in Wessex, was killed in 661 when Caedwalla was about two years old. His family took refuge in the great forest of the Caedwalla was apparently one of those trying to claim territory in Wessex after the death of Cenwalh. But he was exiled from Wessex in 680 by Centwine. During that time he had gathered around him a band of warriors. In 685 Caedwalla "began to strive for the kingdom" (or wanted to become king). He repeatedly attacked Sussex and killed king Ethelwalth. Two of the Sussex ealdormen drove Caedwalla out of that kingdom. Still landless, Caedwalla turned his attentions again towards Wessex. This same year Centwine retired to a monastery and abdicated the throne of Wessex.

By 686 Caedwalla was able to declare himself king. The remaining underkings in Wessex did not oppose him and kept their territories. During the three years Caedwalla reigned over Wessex he was constantly at war. He and his brother Mul ravaged Kent in 686. After subjecting Kent to his rule he left his brother Mul in charge as king of Kent. That summer he attacked Sussex and killed king Berhthun. In 687 the men of Kent rose up against Mul and he was burned with twelve of his companions. They soon restored their own royal line on the throne. Caedwalla invaded a second time and ruled Kent himself. Caedwalla next invaded the Isle of Wight. King Arwald was killed. Caewalla allowed the two young athelings of Wight, Arwald's brothers, to convert to Christianity before executing them. He then began to kill all the inhabitants and replace them with settlers from Wessex. Although still a pagan, he gave several large estates on the Isle of Wight to bishop Wilfrid. It was during his war on the Isle of Wight that Caedwalla was badly wounded. His wound seemed mortal to him. But he had succeeded in conquering most of the south-east of England. In 688 he abdicated the throne of Wessex. He was able to journey to Rome where on Easter day 689, he was baptised by Pope Sergius. About ten days later on 20 April he died and was buried in Rome. He set a precedent for the west Saxon kings who followed him to dominate all of south-east England.

Caedwalla remained a pagan until end of his life. He was a friend of bishop Wilfrid and at times called himself the defender of the church. He granted land for a monastery to an Abbot Ecgbald at Hoo in Kent. His authority in Surrey is demonstrated by a grant of land for an monastery in Farnham. He saw his attempts to remove all the Jutes from the Isle of Wight as a war of Christianity against the pagans. When he left England on his pilgrimage to Rome he stopped at Calais and donated money to build a church there. He did the same at the court of the Lombards before going on to Rome. Caedwalla was succeeded by Ine.


Petting zoo

"And a moo-moo there,"
"Here a moo, there a moo,"
"Everywhere a moo-moo,"
"Old Macdonald had a farm E-I-E-I-O!"

The Inheritors (novel)

The Inheritors is the 1955 second novel by the British author William Golding, who is best known for "Lord of the Flies". It was his personal favourite, and concerns the extinction of one of the last remaining tribes of Neanderthals at the hands of the more sophisticated (and malevolent) "Homo sapiens".
One of the band, Lok, is a "point of view" character. He is the one we follow as one by one the adults of the band die or are killed, then the young are stolen by the "new people" The new people are a group of early modern humans. Lok and Fa, the remaining adults, are both fascinated and repelled by the new people. They observe their actions and rituals with amazement, only slowly understanding that harm is meant by the 'sticks' (arrows) of the new people.

Lok's people have powerful sense-impressions and feelings, and appear sometimes to share thoughts in a near-telepathic way. They live very simply, using their mental abilities to connect to one another without extensive vocabulary or the kinds of memories that create culture. They have wide knowledge of food sources, mostly roots and vegetables. Their lives are lived so much in the present that the reader realizes they are very different from us, living in something like an eternal present, or at least a present broken and shaped by seasons. The way they cope with planning and imagination is by saying the phrase "I have a picture", and then talking about their thoughts.

In the final chapter, we move to the point of view of the new race, more or less modern humans fleeing in their boats. Apparently they are terribly afraid of the Neanderthals whom they believe to be devils of the forest. This last chapter, the only one written from the humans' point of view, points to the inheritance of the world by the new species.

Wishing well

Bird cage

A bird cage (sometimes birdcage) is a cage to hold a bird. Bird cages are used in the home to contain a pet bird, such as a parakeet or a canary. Bird cages used in the home are made of metal wire. A bird cage usually has seed and water dishes, a cuttle bone, and toys such as little bells and mirrors. However, the best ones available are shredding and foraging toys, which are more expensive than the "classic" bird accessories. These keep the birds engaged and prevent boredom. There are perches for the bird to sit on. A cage may be hung from a ceiling or a floor stand. The floor of the cage is usually lined with some sort of paper to absorb the bird's droppings, water spills, etc.

When a bird cage is round, tall and narrow or made of galvanized metal it should be avoided. Round cages confuse the birds and cause behavioral issues due to their shape, narrow and tall cages don't let the bird fly properly and any type of galvanized metal can potentially cause a lethal heavy metal intoxication.

Bird cages should be at least 18x18x18 inches when it comes to small birds. For bigger species an aviary can be the best option.
Breeding birds will need a very big cage and a nest box. 
If a bird is going to be caged many hours everyday it will need at least a small aviary with a lot of shredding and foraging toys to not develop behavioral issues such as feather plucking.

Ealdorman

An ealdorman (from Old English "ealdorman", lit. "elder man"; plural: "ealdormen") is a term used for a high-ranking royal official who was in charge of one or more shires. The title dates from the sixth century and was in use up to the time of King Canute. Their position was a combination of administrator, judge and military . Ealdormen were the of the later English earls.

The king appointed an ealdorman to govern one or more shires or territories. The ealdorman was also responsible for leading his local fyrd (part-time army) in battle. But these armies owed their first to their ealdorman. Very often the support of one or more ealdormen could help a royal candidate to become king. In many cases ealdormen succeeded yet kept the same rights. Several had been underkings and were members of the royal family. In early Anglo-Saxon documents ealdormen are also termed ", "", or " in documents of the time.

The term first appears in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle under the year 568. But it was probably used long before then. As early as the seventh century ealdormen were seen as judges. But the development of the shire may have come later. As ealdormanries began to become (passed down from father to son) the families who held them became more and more powerful. Several rose in power second only to the king. They were described in documents by the term "". In the eighth century these occurred in Northumbria, Mercia and Kent. The term "patricius" was roughly the same as the office of mayor of the palace in the Merovingian dynasty of Frankish kings. This could be dangerous for a king to have someone so powerful exercising power in his name. In the eighth and ninth centuries the most dangerous ealdormen were those who claimed royal descent. They could and in some cases did rise up against a king and took the throne themselves. In the very basic royal administrations of the time a king needed to depend on his ealdormen. A king could create ealdormen from his own family. But he could only fill only a portion of the ealdormanries in that way. As the families of ealdormen banded together in ties of mutual support it became more difficult to remove an ealdorman.

The term ealdorman was replaced by the term earl during the eleventh century. In the laws of King Canute both ealdormen and earls are mentioned. But there was no distinction made between them. After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the title Earl was no longer with "dux" or "princeps". They were written at times as "" (count). King William replaced most Anglo-Saxon earls with his own . He then limited the power of most earls giving them control of counties, castles or other territories. A few were given more power. These were titled Earl palatine.

Centwine of Wessex

Centwine ( 685) was King of Wessex from to 685. He appears to have been one of several underkings of Wessex after the death of Cenwalh. But at some point he united the kingdom of Wessex under his rule. 

Centwine was the probable son of Cynegils and grandson of Ceolwulf, King of Wessex. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Centwine became king . Also that he succeeded Aescwine. Bede wrote that after the death of King Cenwalh: "his under-rulers took upon them the kingdom of the people, and dividing it among themselves, held it ten years". Bede's view of Aescwine and Centwine as underkings may represent the views of King Ine. His family ruled Wessex in Bede's time. If the kingdom did fragment following Cenwalh's death, it was reunited during Centwine's reign. An entry under 682 in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that "Centwine drove the Britons to the sea". Aldhelm wrote Centwine won three major victories but does not say who he defeated. Centwine is reported to have and became a monk. The date of his death is unknown.

Centwine married Eangyth, niece of Eorcenbert of Kent. Her sister, Eormenburh was married to King Egfrith of Northumbria. Together they had:



Les Misérables

Les Misérables is a novel by Victor Hugo. It was published in 1862. The story is about a former convict named Jean Valjean. He tries to find a meaningful life, but is followed by a police officer. The story has been made into movies several times. It has also been made into a musical. He is trying to run away after being convicted by the police since he stole bread to feed his sister's children.

The work describes French society between the reign of Napoleon and that of Louis Philippe I. One of the main characters, Marius, takes part in the June Rebellion.

Hugo based some of his characters on the lives of real people. That way, Valjean is probably based upon Eugène François Vidocq. He probably used the story of Bienvenu de Miollis to base the Bishop of Digne on. De Mollis was the bishop of Digne from 1805 to 1838. Enjolras, a revolutionary leader is probably based on Louise Michel, a French anarchist.

Les Misérables starts by describing the life of the nice Bishop Myriel who is always helping the poor. Then the book talks about Jean Valjean, a man who was arrested because he stole some bread to feed his sister's children. He is freed from prison after 19 years and he wanders through France until the Bishop takes him in for the night. Valjean tries to steal the Bishop's silverware, but he is caught. The Bishop pretends that he gave Valjean the silverware and tells him to be good.

Jean Valjean changes his name to M. Madeline and becomes a factory owner and the town's mayor. One of his workers is named Fantine. She had a child called Cosette who lives with an evil innkeeper named Thenardier. The other women in the factory get Fantine fired or removed from her job. When Fantine is attacked by a man on the streets, Valjean protects her from the police and takes her to the hospital because she is sick. Fantine tells Valjean about Cosette and asks him to save Cosette. Unfortunately, she is too sick and dies. 

A police officer called Javert finds out about Valjean and he chases him and arrests him, but Valjean escapes from jail and goes to find Cosette. When he does, he takes her from the innkeeper Thenardier and runs away to Paris. There, he is chased by Javert and eventually finds a place where Cosette can go to school and he can work safely. 

Meanwhile, a young man named Marius has found a new group of friends at the ABC Café. They (the Friends of the ABC) are unhappy because a lot of people are poor. So they want to make the government help the poor people but only one man in the government wants to. His name is Jean Lamarque, and he is very sick. A girl named Eponine, the daughter of Thenardier, falls in love with Marius, but he doesn't love her.

When Cosette is done with school, she and Valjean go to live in a house on Plumet Street (Rue Plumet). There, Marius meets Cosette and they fall in love. Then, Thenardier, who lost his job, tries to rob Valjean, but Eponine saves him and Cosette. 

Then, Lamarque dies! The Friends of the ABC are angry and build barricades (or giant walls) out of furniture in the center of Paris. The government is angry and sends Javert to go spy on the Friends.

Valjean learns that Cosette loves Marius and goes to save Marius at the barricade. While Javert is inside the barricades, the Friends find out that he is a spy and they tie him up. Valjean is supposed to kill him but he decides not to which makes Javert very confused. Javert decides trying to understand why Valjean did not kill him even though Valjean used to be a bad person is too hard for him to understand, so he jumps off a bridge and drowns. Then, the army attacks the barricade! Marius is almost shot but Eponine saves him. However, she was killed while saving him. The fighting continues and most of the Friends are killed. Valjean takes Marius and drags him through the sewers to a safe place. 

Cosette and Marius get engaged which means that they are about to get married! Before their wedding, Valjean tells Marius that he is going to go away forever after the wedding because he thinks that he is a bad person. At the wedding, Marius learns that Valjean saved him, so he and Cosette tell Valjean that they don't want him to go away. But Valjean is too sad so he still dies. As he dies though, he sees Fantine again.

The book was a great success. It is thought one of James's finest works. The story has been adapted to a BBC television program and to a movie starring Nicole Kidman.

Isabel Archer, from Albany, New York, is invited by her mother's sister, Lydia Touchett, to visit Lydia's rich husband, Mr Touchett, at his house near London, following the death of Isabel's father. There, Isabel meets her uncle, her friendly sick cousin Ralph Touchett, and the Touchetts' neighbor, Lord Warburton.

Isabel later declines Warburton's sudden proposal of marriage. She also rejects Caspar Goodwood, the son and heir of a rich Boston mill owner. Although Isabel likes both Caspar and Lord Warbuton,she likes her independence, which prevents such a marriage, which she feels would sacrifice of her freedom.

The elder Touchett grows ill and, at the request of his son, Ralph, leaves a lot of money to Isabel upon his death. With her large fortune, Isabel travels to Europe and meets an American , Gilbert Osmond, in Florence. Although Isabel had previously rejected both Warburton and Goodwood, she accepts Osmond's proposal of marriage, unaware that it has been promoted by the accomplished but untrustworthy Madame Merle, another American expatriate, whom Isabel had met at the Touchetts' house.

Isabel and Osmond live in Rome, but their marriage rapidly sours, owing to Osmond's egotism and lack of genuine affection for his wife. Isabel grows fond of Pansy, Osmond's presumed daughter by his first marriage, and wants to grant her wish to marry Edward Rosier, a young art collector.

The snobbish Osmond would prefer that Pansy accept the proposal of Warburton, who had previously proposed to Isabel. Isabel suspects, however, that Warburton may just be faking interest in Pansy to get close to Isabel again, and the conflict creates even more problems within the unhappy marriage.

Isabel then learns that Ralph is dying at his house in England and prepares to go to him for his final hours, but Osmond selfishly opposes this plan. Meanwhile, Isabel learns from her sister-in-law that Pansy is actually the daughter of Madame Merle, who had had an adulterous relationship with Osmond for several years.

Isabel pays a final visit to Pansy, who begs her to return someday, which Isabel reluctantly promises to do. She then leaves, without telling her husband, to comfort the dying Ralph in England, where she remains until his death.

Goodwood encounters her at Ralph's estate and begs her to leave Osmond and come away with him. He passionately embraces and kisses her, but Isabel flees. Goodwood seeks her out the next day but is told she has set off again for Rome.

The ending is ambiguous, and the reader is left to imagine whether Isabel returned to Osmond to suffer out her marriage in noble tragedy (perhaps for Pansy's sake), or if she is going to rescue Pansy and leave Osmond.

Blind experiment

A blind or blinded experiment is a test or experiment in 
where the experimenter does not know which treatment is given to a subject. The idea is to avoid bias which the experimenter might otherwise introduce. If both tester and subject are blinded, the trial is a double-blind trial.

Suppose consumers are asked to compare the tastes of different brands of a product. Obviously, the identities of the product should be hidden – otherwise consumers tend to prefer the brand they are familiar with. Similarly, when testing a pharmaceutical drug, both patients and experimenter should not know the dosage being given in each case.

The opposite of a blind trial is an open trial. The terms blind (adjective) or to blind (transitive verb) when used in this sense are figurative extensions of the literal idea of blindfolding someone.

Blind experiments went on to be used outside of purely scientific settings. In 1817, a committee of scientists and musicians compared a Stradivarius violin to one with a guitar-like design made by the naval engineer François Chanot. A well-known violinist played each instrument while the committee listened in the next room to avoid prejudice.

One of the first essays advocating a blinded approach to experiments in general came from Claude Bernard in the latter half of the 19th century, who recommended splitting any scientific experiment between the theorist who conceives the experiment and a naive (and preferably uneducated) observer who registers the results without foreknowledge of the theory or hypothesis being tested. This suggestion contrasted starkly with the prevalent Enlightenment-era attitude that scientific observation can only be objectively valid when undertaken by a well-educated, informed scientist.

Double-blind methods came into especial prominence in the mid-20th century.

Double-blind describes an especially reliable way of conducting an experiment. It tries to eliminate subjective, unrecognized biases carried by an experiment's subjects "and</u/l>" conductors.

In a double-blind experiment, neither the participants nor the researchers know which participants belong to the control group, and which to the test group. Random assignment of test subjects to the experimental and control groups is the key to any double-blind research design. The information about who the subjects were, and which group they belonged to, is kept by a third party until the study is over.

Double-blind methods can be applied to any experimental situation in which there is a possibility that the results will be affected by conscious/unconscious bias on the part of researchers, participants, or both.

Dalmatian city-states

The Dalmatian city-states were 8 cities in Dalmatia where the native Dalmatian Italians survived the Slav invasions, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. These cities were: Zara, Spalato, Ragusa, Cattaro, Trau, Ossero (also called Cherso or Crespa), Veglia and Arbe.

At the beginning of the seventh century, the Avars with some Slav tribes devastated and conquered the Roman province of Dalmatia. The local Latin population survived only in the coast and islands of Dalmatia. There they created 8 little cities that maintained political links with the Byzantine Empire, that defended these cities allowing their commerce.

The original names of the cities were Jadera, Spalatum, Crespa, Arba, Tragurium, Vecla, Ragusium and Cattarum. The language and the laws were initially Latin, but after a few centuries they developed their own neolatin language (the "Dalmatico"), that lasted until the nineteenth century.

The cities were maritime centers with a huge commerce mainly with the Italian peninsula and with the growing Republic of Venice. From it they received their Italian culture and arts. After the year 1000 AD, the Venetian Doge Orseolo II started to control all coastal Dalmatia, but it was only in 1420 AD that Venice was able to obtain the full domination of these City-states.

In this way seven of these cities became part of the Venetian republic: Zara was the most Venetian (or Italian) of them, remaining Italian until WWII.

But one of the city-states, Ragusium (or Ragusa) was dominated by Venice only for a few decades in the eleventh century and later created the famous "Repubblica di Ragusa". This was an autonomous state under the protection of the Ottoman empire, and lasted until the conquest by Napoleon in 1804 AD when was united to the Napoleonic kingdom of Italy.

Arrondissements of the Haute-Garonne department

There are 3 arrondissements in the Haute-Garonne department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into "arrondissements", which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture.

If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture.

Arrondissements are further divided into cantons and communes.

The arrondissements of Haute-Garonne are:

Anthony of Padua, O.F.M. (born Fernando Martins de Bulhões; 15 August 1195 – 13 June 1231), was a Portuguese Catholic priest. He was a friar of the Franciscan Order. He was born and raised in a rich family in Lisbon. Anthony was canonised as a saint on 30 May 1232, less than a year after his death. He is considered a patron saint of lost or stolen items.

He goes that he had a book of sacred songs in which he'd written his own personal notes. A young novice from his complex of buildings decided to leave the order. As he was leaving, he stole Anthony's book. Anthony prayed for it to be returned. Sometime later the missing novice returned to the order and asked to be taken back in, and returned Anthony's book. This was deemed a miracle.

Anthony died in Padua, Italy. After his death, because of that incident, people prayed to Anthony when they had lost something or had it stolen. Some of them got their things back. Those were also deemed "miracles." They are what got him sainthood.

Culture of Nepal

Nepal has a unique culture. Its cultural heritage has developed over several thousands of years. It covers Nepal's many ethnic, tribal and social classes.

There are at least 92 living languages spoken in Nepal, though some studies list 123. Nepal's languages come from three major language groups: Indo-Aryan, Tibeto-Burman and indigenous.

It is the first language of about half the country's population, and is used by people of most ethnic groups to communicate with each other.

Both Hinduism and Buddhism in Nepal date back more than 2000 years. The 2001 census recorded that 80.6% of the population was Hindu. Buddhism was practiced by about 11% of the population, although many people often practice their own mix of Hindu, Buddhist, and/or animist traditions. About 3.2% practice Islam. Another 3.6% of the population follows the native Kirant religion. Christianity is practiced officially by less than 0.5%.

Nepalese people have several festivals that they celebrate each year. The longest and the most important of these is Dashain. It is celebrated for 15 days, and is dedicated to the Hindu goddess Durga. Most festivals include dancing and music, as well as all kinds of local food.

Surface water

Surface water is water on the surface of the planet, above the ground. It is the water in rivers, lakes, wetlands and oceans. It is different to groundwater, which is in the soil, and atmospheric water, which is in the sky.

Fresh surface water is added to by precipitation and by taking ground-water from the ground. It is lost through evaporation, where it becomes atmospheric water, or through seepage into the ground, where it becomes ground water. It is also lost through use by plants for transpiration, animals for drinking, or by humans for agriculture, washing and other purposes. Fresh water is also discharged to the ocean, where it becomes salt water.


Nature photography

Nature photography is photography of natural things such as landscapes, wildlife, and plants. It can include close-ups of natural scenes and textures.

The term refers to the stiff tail which was held above the ground as a counterweight when the animal walked or ran.

Tetanurae are defined as all theropods more closely related to modern birds than to "Ceratosaurus". Gauthier considered it to consist of Carnosauria and Coelurosauria. Modern birds are the only living representatives of the clade Tetanurae.

Heart of a Dog

Heart of a Dog is a novel by Mikhail Bulgakov. It is a biting satire of the "New Soviet man". It was written in 1925 at the height of the NEP period, when Communism seemed to be weakening in the Soviet Union. 

Its theme is "the [Communist] revolution's misguided attempt to radically transform mankind". It has elements of fantasy and science fiction, and wit and humour. 

The book's publication was at first forbidden in the Soviet Union. It circulated in samizdat until it was officially released in the country in 1987. It is "one of novelist Mikhail Bulgakov's most beloved stories" featuring a stray dog "named Sharik, who takes human form" as a slovenly but self-important New Soviet Man. The dog's internal monologue at the start, grumbling at his life in the city, sets the scene for the novel.

Moscow, 1924.
After a terrible day, a stray dog thinks about his bad luck to live on the streets of Moscow. Then, to his surprise, successful surgeon Filip Filippovich Preobrazhensky arrives and offers the dog a piece of sausage. Overjoyed, the dog follows Filip back to his flat, where he is given a stock dog name, Sharik.

At the house, Sharik gets to know Dr. Preobrazhensky's household, which includes Doctor Bormenthal, Professor's student and protegé and two female servants. Despite the Professor's vocal anti-communism, his frequent medical treatment of the Party leaders makes him untouchable. He refuses to reduce the size of his seven-room flat, and treats the Bolsheviks on the housing committee with contempt. Impressed by his new master, Sharik slips easily into the role of "a gentleman's dog".

After Sharik's health improves, the Professor prepares to operate on him. Sharik is dragged by the scruff of the neck into the lab. There, he is sedated and an operation begins. As Bormenthal assists, the Professor gives him a human pituitary gland and human testicles. 

During the weeks after the operation, the household is stunned as Sharik begins transforming into an incredibly unkempt human. In the aftermath, the Professor and Bormenthal patiently attempt to teach Sharikov basic etiquette. Instead, Sharikov mocks the idea of manners as relics of Tsarism. He insists that it is better to behave, as he puts it, "naturally". As a result, Sharikov curses in front of women, refuses to shave, and dresses like a slob.

Meanwhile, Sharikov turns the Professor's life into a living hell. He is caught attempting to rape one of the female servants. Enraged, Bormenthal beats Sharikov up and forces him to apologize. Infuriated, Sharikov leaves the apartment and remains gone for several days.

Later, Bormenthal begs the Professor for permission to dose Sharikov with arsenic, calling him a man with "the heart of a dog". The Professor is horrified and orders Bormenthal not to "slander the dog". He explains that the human body parts, which came from a drunk, are responsible for all of Sharikov's defects. Bormenthal then suggests that they redo the operation, using the body of a genius. Again the Professor refuses, explaining that the operation was meant to improve the human race. Breaking with his former beliefs, the Professor admits that any peasant woman could give birth to a genius and that eugenics are a waste of time. In conclusion, the Professor refuses to permit Sharikov's murder or to undo the operation, which could easily kill him as well.

Soon after, Sharikov returns, explaining that he has been granted a job by the Soviet State. He now spends his work-day strangling vagrant cats, whose fur is used to imitate that of squirrels. Soon after Sharikov brings home a female co-worker, whom he introduces to the Professor as his new common law wife. 

Instead of giving them their own room, as Sharikov demands, the Professor takes the woman aside and explains that Sharikov is the product of a lab experiment gone horribly wrong. The woman, who had believed that Sharikov was a Red Army veteran wounded during the Russian Civil War, leaves the apartment in tears. Seething with hatred, Sharikov threatens to fire her. Again Bormenthal beats Sharikov up and makes him promise not to do anything of the sort.

The following day, a senior Party official arrives and tells the Professor that Sharikov has denounced him to the secret police, the Cheka. Explaining that nothing is going to happen to him due to the State's distrust of Sharikov, the Party official departs. When Sharikov returns, the Professor and Bormenthal order him to leave the flat permanently. Instead, Sharikov refuses and draws a revolver. Enraged, the Professor and Bormenthal pounce upon him. 

That night, an ominous silence reigns in the flat and the lights are left on for many hours after bedtime. Over the days that follow, the Professor and Bormenthal look far more relaxed than at any time before Sharikov's arrival. Eventually, the police arrive with a search warrant. They demand to see Sharikov. Unintimidated, the Professor orders Bormenthal to summon Sharikov, who is slowly being transformed back into a dog. The Professor explains the change as a natural phenomenon, although it is obvious to the reader that in fact he and Bormenthal have simply performed the reverse operation. The police depart.

In the aftermath, the fully canine Sharik blissfully resumes his status as a gentleman's dog. However, he is soon terrified to see the Professor bringing home a human brain and removing the pituitary gland...


Through the Looking-Glass

Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There is a children's novel by Lewis Carroll. John Tenniel drew the pictures. The book was published by Macmillan in 1871. It is a sequel to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland".

The book is a series of dream-like fantasy episodes. The theme which ties them together is Alice's journey as a pawn from the start of a fantasy game of chess until she reaches the eighth rank and becomes a queen.

The story is about the strange world Alice discovers when she passes through a looking-glass (mirror) above a fireplace at home. The setting is a game of chess. Well known characters from the book include Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Walrus and the Carpenter, the White Knight, and the Garden of Live Flowers.

Alice meets the White Queen, who is very absent-minded but boasts of her ability to remember future events. Alice and the White Queen advance into the chessboard's fifth rank by crossing over a stream together. At the moment of the crossing, the Queen transforms into a talking Sheep in a small shop. Alice soon finds herself struggling to handle the oars of a small rowboat, where the Sheep annoys her with (seemingly) nonsensical shouting about "crabs" and "feathers". Unknown to Alice, these are standard terms in the jargon of rowing. Thus (for a change) the Queen/Sheep was speaking in a perfectly logical and meaningful way.

The book has several famous nonsense poems, such as "Jabberwocky" and "The Walrus and the Carpenter". and many examples of word play such as puns and made-up words, in addition to portmanteau words.

Gloria Jean Watkins (September 25, 1952 – December 15, 2021), better known by her pen name bell hooks was an award-winning African-American radical feminist writer and speaker. bell hooks takes her name from her great-grandmother Bell Blair Hooks. Her pen name does not use capital letters because the ideas in her writing are more important than the fact that she wrote them.

She was born in Kentucky and grew up in a working class family. When she was very young, she was in a racially segregated school where she did not learn with white students. Later, she went to a high school that had many white students and teachers. She went to Stanford University, University of Madison-Wisconsin, and University of California, Santa Cruz. In 1976 she started teaching at the University of California.

In 1978 she published a collection of poems called "And There We Wept: Poems". In 1981 she published her first academic book called "Ain't I a Woman? Black Women and Feminism. "In it, hooks talks about the racism and sexism black women face in the civil rights and feminist movements. hooks started writing "Ain't I a Woman? "when she was 19, and it took her 6 years to write and 8 years to find a publisher. Afterwards, hooks became popular and many wanted to hear her ideas. She is considered an important leftist (anti-capitalism) and postmodern political thinker.

In 1984, she wrote a book called "Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center. "The main idea focuses on the idea that feminism is about making women equal to men. hooks says this does not make sense, because men are not equal due to things like racism and classism - the divide between rich and poor. hooks talks about feminism that is more inclusive. hooks asks women to understand they are different but still accept each other. This idea of gender relating to race and class is called intersectionality. hooks also says men must do their part in helping to stop the patriarchy.

hooks has written over 30 books. Her work deals with the idea of a white-supremacist-capitalist-patriarchy. This is the idea that white people rule, capitalism rules, and men rule. By combining them into one term, hooks says they are connected. She also talks about how communities that love are able to overcome these problems.

hooks also thinks education is important, and has written seven books to help educate children. The most popular is "Happy to Be Nappy."

She has been in several documentaries about politics. "Happy to be Nappy" was made into an award-winning documentary in 2004 called" Happy to be Nappy and Other Stories of Me". In" Give a Damn Again" she talks with Cornel West.

Kalākaua

Kalākaua I (November 16, 1836 - January 20, 1891) was the last king of Hawaii. His full name was David Laamea Kamanakapuu Mahinulani Nalaiaehuokalani Lumialani Kalākaua. He was sometimes called "The Merrie Monarch". He was king from February 12, 1874 until his death on January 20, 1891.

Kalākaua's parents were a high chief and a high chiefess. He had two older siblings and six younger siblings. When he was four, he started school. He became fluent in English and the Hawaiian language. He started studying law at age 16. However, his government positions kept him from completing his legal training. By 1856, Kalākaua was a major on the staff of King Kamehameha IV. He had also led a political organization known as the Young Hawaiians. Kalākaua also served in the Department of the Interior. In 1863, he was appointed postmaster general.

The king before Kalākaua was King Lunalilo. He died on February 3, 1874. Kalākaua was elected to replace him. Kalākaua named his brother, William Pitt Leleiohoku, as his heir.

Kalākaua started his reign with a tour of the Hawaiian islands. This made him more popular. In October 1874, he sent representatives to the United States to negotiate a treaty. In November, Kalākaua went to Washington DC to meet Ulysses S. Grant. An agreement was reached and the treaty was signed on January 30, 1875. The treaty allowed certain Hawaiian goods, mainly sugar and rice, to come into the United States tax-free.

During the early part of Kalākaua's reign, he dismissed many cabinets and appointed new ones. This drew criticism from people who wanted Hawaiian government to be like the United Kingdom's constitutional monarchy. They believed the legislature should control the cabinet ministers rather than the king. This struggle continued throughout Kalākaua's reign.

In 1881, King Kalākaua left Hawaii on a trip around the world. He went to study immigration and to improve foreign relations. He also wanted to study how other rulers ruled. In his absence, his sister and heir, Princess Liliuokalani, ruled as regent. (Prince Leleiohoku, the former heir, had died in 1877.) The King received a royal welcome in San Francisco. In the Empire of Japan, he met with the Meiji Emperor. He continued through Qing Dynasty China, Siam under King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), Burma, British Raj India, Egypt, Italy, Belgium, the German Empire, Austria-Hungary, the French Third Republic, Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and back through the United States. During this trip, he met with many other heads of state, including Pope Leo XIII, Umberto I of Italy, Tewfik, Viceroy of Egypt, William II of Germany, Rama V of Siam, President Chester Arthur, and Victoria of the United Kingdom. In this, he became the first king to travel around the world.
Kalākaua also built ʻIolani Palace. It cost $300,000, an amount unheard of at the time. Many of the furnishings in the palace were ordered by Kalākaua while he was in Europe.

Kalākaua decided to build the Kamehameha Statue. It honored Kamehameha I, the first king of the whole Hawaiian Islands. The original statue was lost when the ship carrying it sank near the Falkland Islands. A replacement was ordered and unveiled by the king in 1883. The original statue was later repaired and sent to Hawaii in 1912. A third statue, erected in 1969, is in the United States Capitol. It is the only statue there that commemorates a native Hawaiian.

King Kalākaua is said to have wanted to build a Polynesian Empire. In 1886, the legislature gave the government $30,000 for the formation of a Polynesian confederation. The King sent representatives to Sāmoa. There Malietoa Laupepa agreed to a confederation between the two kingdoms. This confederation did not last very long, because King Kalākaua lost power the next year to the Bayonet Constitution.

By 1887, some people were very frustrated with Kalākaua. They blamed him for the Kingdom's growing debt. They accused him of being a spendthrift. Some foreigners wanted to force him to abdicate and put his sister Liliuokalani onto the throne. Others wanted to end the monarchy altogether and make the islands part of the United States. The people who wanted to be part of the United States formed a group called the Hawaiian League. In 1887, members of the League armed with guns got together. The King was frightened by this show of force. He offered to transfer his powers to the foreign ministers representing the United States, the United Kingdom, or Portugal. The members of the league instead asked him to sign a new constitution.

This new constitution was nicknamed the Bayonet Constitution. It took away much of the King's executive power. It took away the voting rights of most native Hawaiians. The legislature could override a veto by the King. The King was no longer allowed to take action without approval of the cabinet. The House of Nobles, the house of legislature appointed by the King, was to be elected. Non-Hawaiian citizens could now vote. Robert Wilcox led a counter-revolution to give power back to the king, but it failed.

By 1890, the King was ill. Under the advice of his physician, he went to San Francisco. His health continued to get worse. He died on January 20, 1891 at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. His final words were, "Tell my people I tried."

Kalākaua's remains were sent to Honolulu aboard the American cruiser USS "Charleston". Because he did not have any children, his sister, Liliuokalani, became queen.

King Kalākaua was called "the Merrie Monarch" because he loved the joyful things in life. While he was king, people started to do hula again. (It had been banned by Queen Kaahumanu in 1830.) There is a hula festival named for him, the Merrie Monarch Festival. He also brought back the Hawaiian martial art of Lua, and surfing. He and his brother and sisters were known as the "Royal Fours" for their musical talents. He wrote "Hawaii Ponoi", which is the state song of Hawaii today. Kalākaua strongly supported the ukulele as a Hawaiian instrument.

"Kalākaua Avenue" in Waikiki is named after him. It is the main avenue of Waikiki. It goes from the Ala Wai Canal to Waikiki beach. It continues almost to the Diamond Head crater.

The most common example is a birthday, where the birth of a person is celebrated every year on the month and day of which they were born. The first "anniversary" of something is celebrated exactly one year after the initial event occurred. The word was first used for Catholic feasts to commemorate saints.

Other examples of common anniversaries are those of weddings and deaths. Having anniversaries for sad incidents can be for remembering someone special, like a famous person that touched many peoples lives or to remember a tragic incident, so that it doesn't happen again. Most countries around the world celebrate national anniversaries. These could be the date of independence of the nation or the adoption of a new constitution, or the coronation of a monarch.

There are different Latin names used for anniversaries depending on the number of years that has passed since the initial event. For example, "biennial" means that two years has passed, "decennial" means that ten years has passed, and "centennial" means that 100 years has passed. For example, many countries have held a big celebration in the 100th anniversary of their country.

Wine or Wini ( before 672) was a 7th century Bishop. He was the first Bishop of Winchester. He later became the Bishop of London.

Wine had been ordained in Gaul. In Wessex King Cenwalh of Wessex had grown tired of his current bishop, Agilbert, who apparently did not speak the Anglo-Saxon language. Wine did speak Anglo-Saxon and was invited by Cenwalh to come to Wessex. Cenwalh built a new church at Winchester; dividing his kingdom into two dioceses. There, Wine was the first bishop of Winchester in 660. Agribert took offense at not being consulted and returned to Gaul. King Oswiu of Northumbria appointed a monk named Chad to be bishop to the Northumbrians. He sent Chad to Canterbury to be consecrated Bishop of York. On Chad's arrival in Kent, however, he discovered Archbishop Dusdedit had died. As no successor had yet been appointed, Chad went to Bishop Wine in Wessex to be consecrated. Wine was the only consecrated Bishop in England at the time recognized by the Church at Rome.

Wine was later expelled by Cenwalh and went to King Wulfhere of Mercia. Bede stated that Wine purchased the see (diocese) of London from Wulfhere. Wine remained the Bishop of London until his death. 
Wine died in 671.

Cenwalh of Wessex

Cenwalh (also spelled Coenwalh, 4 April 615 – 27 October 672) was a the King of Wessex from 642 to 645 and again from 648 until his death in 672. He was also a Claimant to the West Saxon throne from 645 to 648. He was deposed by his former brother-in-law, King Penda of Mercia because Cenwalh divorced Penda's sister, Ardith.

During Cenwalh's rule, Wessex continued to expand and the kingdom's relations with Mercia soured even more than ever. He was also a great soldier, actively fighting in Battles and Wars. In 623 when he was just eight, Cenwalh alongside his father, Cynegils and their family, converted to Roman Catholicism.

Cenwalh was considered a great ruler who cared about his people than himself. He followed the footsteps of his father to becoming one of Wessex's greatest kings.

Cenwalh died in Winchester from Tuberculosis on the afternoon of 27 October 672, at the age of 57. He was succeeded by his second wife, Seaxburh.

Cenwalh was the son of King Cynegils. When his father died in 643 Cenwalh succeeded him as king of Wessex. He married a sister of Penda of Mercia who was the power in the region at that time. When Cenwalh her (set her aside) in favor of another wife, Penda invaded Wessex. Penda drove Cenwalh into exile in East Anglia. He remained in East Anglia for three years with King Anna of East Anglia. There he learned about Christianity and was baptised. While in exile, Wulfhere, the son of Penda, took a great deal of territory away from Wessex. He gave the Isle of Wight to Aethelwalh, King of Sussex.

Cenwalh was restored to his kingdom . How he was allowed to return is not recorded. Nor is it recorded who ruled Wessex in his absence. But an entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the year 648 seems to indicate it might have been Cuthred, the son of Cwichelm. Cenwalh gave Cuthred three thousand hides of land (300–450 square miles) of land at Ashdown in Berkshire. This may have been most, if not all, of Berkshire. This was much larger than an estate a king might give a family member. Cenwalh seems to have left the Thames river basin as a result of pressure from Mercia. That made Berkshire his northern frontier with Mercia.

When Bishop Birinus died in 650, Cenwalh invited Agilbert, a Frankish monk to come to Wessex as the new bishop of Dorchester. But after some time Cenwalh grew tired of not being able to understand the bishop, who apparently did not speak the Anglo-Saxon language. Cenwalh created a new diocese at Winchester in 660 and made Wine the first bishop. Agilbert took offense at not being consulted and returned to Gaul. Wine was later expelled by Cenwalh and went to King Wulfhere of Mercia. Bede stated that Wine purchased the see (diocese) of London from Wulfhere. This left Wessex without a bishop. Cenwalh sent appeals to Agilbert to return to Wessex. Agilbert turned Cenwalh down saying his current duties as bishop of Paris prevented his return. But he sent his nephew Leutherius in his place. Cenwalh sent Leutherius to Theodore, Archbishop of Canterbury for consecration. Leutherius was welcomed in Wessex as the new bishop of Winchester.

In 652 Cenwalh was fighting at Bradford on Avon. Who he was fighting against is not entirely clear. But the Welsh were there led by Morgan Mwyfawr. At least one chronicle calls it a civil war implying he was also fighting other West Saxons. In 658 he defeated the British at Penselwood. He defeated them a second time at Postbury. By 661 he had regained control over Somerset. But Mercia was constantly pushing into his territory. It was also in 661 that Wulfhere of Mercia controlled all lands north of the Thames including the abbey at Dorchester. This was one reason Cenwalh created the new diocese at Winchester which was further away from Mercian control. Cenwalh's territory in the mid-660s was significantly reduced by the Mercians. Cenwalh died in 672. After his death his widow, Queen Seaxburh, did what she could to hold Wessex together.

Rebecca Nurse

Rebecca Towne Nurse (13 February 1621 – July 19, 1692) was a pious 71-year-old grandmother when she was hanged as a witch in Salem Village on July 19, 1692. Her death was the turning point in the Salem Witch Trials. People started to doubt the truthfulness of the girls said to be afflicted and tormented by those arrested and tried for witchcraft. 

Nurse was born in Great Yarmouth, England in 1621. In 1644, her family settled in Salem Village, Massachusetts Bay Colony (now Danvers, Massachusetts). About 1644, she married Francis Nurse, a tray-maker. The couple were highly esteemed in the colony because few could work wood into trays, cups, mugs, dishes and other useful objects. They had eight children.

The Nurses and the Putnams of Salem had several disputes over land. On March 23, 1692, a warrant was issued for Rebecca's arrest on suspicion of witchcraft. The Putnams were behind the arrest. Many villagers were angry that she had been accused of witchcraft. She was 70 years old and known to be a very pious woman. 

Her trial began on June 30, 1692. Many testified to her good character. The afflicted girls of the community however testified that she was tormenting them. She was found not guilty of witchcraft. Some wanted her found guilty and urged the judges to reconsider their verdict. They did, and she was found guilty.

She was hanged. Her body was buried near the gallows with others who were hanged for witchcraft. In the night, her relatives dug up her body. They buried it on the family homestead. This homestead is now a landmark. Nurse is a character in Arthur Miller's "The Crucible".

Cwichelm of Wessex

Cwichelm (died circa 636) was the King of the Gewisse, although more commonly called the King of Wessex. He reigned from 626 until his death. He was a pagan king who became a Christian shortly before his death.

Cwichelm was the son of Cynegils, King of Wessex. He ruled jointly with his father. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 614 says Cynegils and Cwichelm fought at a place named Beandun, which cannot be identified. The account went on to say they slew two thousand sixty-five Welsh. Another chronicle entry for 627 (corrected to 626) states an Eomer was sent by "Cwichelm, king of the West Saxons, thinking to stab king Eadwine". It goes on to say Eomer stabbed his thane, Lilla, and a Forthere but only wounding the king. The plot to kill the Northumbrian king failed and the following year Eadwine (Edwin) sent an army to punish Wessex. The next mention of Cwichelm in the chronicle is for the year 628. It states that Cyngils, king of Wessex, and Cwichelm his son 'fought with Penda at Cirencester and came to an agreement with him there'. The agreement seems to have been to give Cirencester to Penda. In 634 Pope Honorius I sent Bishop Birinus to England. When he reached the territory of the Gewisse (Wessex) he found them almost completely pagan. He began to convert the West Saxons to Christianity. In 635 Cynegils was baptized and King Oswald of Northumbria stood as his Godfather. In 636 Cwichelm was baptised at Dorchester. He died later in the same year (636). Although he died before his father, both were succeeded by his brother Cenwalh in 643.

Cwichelm had a son:


File hosting service

A file hosting service is an Internet service that stores files for its users. It allows users to upload files that could then be accessed over the internet from a different computer, tablet, smart phone or other networked device, after a password is provided. The files can possibly also be accessed by other users, depending on the service or what the user prefers.

A variation of this is one-click hosting, which allows users to easily upload one or more files from their hard drives (or from a remote location) on to the one-click host's server. Many web services provide free one-click hosting for image files. This gives the file an accessible URL that can be used to identify it on the internet.

Coronary artery bypass surgery is a type of surgery that relieves chest pain, caused by lack of blood flow, and reduces the risk of death from heart disease. It is also known as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG, pronounced "cabbage") surgery, and known by doctors as heart bypass or bypass surgery. In this surgery, blood vessels from elsewhere in the patient's body are added to the heart vessels to go around blood vessels blocked by fat and get more blood into the heart so it can keep running. This surgery usually happens with the heart stopped, which makes machines that act as lungs and heart needed. However, it is possible to have the surgery with the heart still pumping, called "off-pump" surgery. 

Puck (Shakespeare)

Puck is a character in a play called "A Midsummer Night's Dream". This play was written by William Shakespeare. In this play, Puck is a servant to the Fairy King, Oberon. Puck has some amazing abilities. For example, he can travel around the world in 40 minutes. In spite of his abilities, Puck makes a few mistakes in the play that create confusion for the other characters. For example, he puts a love potion into the wrong person's eyes. He also plays tricks. He puts a donkey's head on one character. 

Puck was not Shakespeare's invention. He was a character in folklore called 'pouke'. He was known as early as 1000 AD. He was an evil, dangerous demon. By the time of Geoffrey Chaucer, he had become linked with the Biblical devil. By Shakespeare's day, he was known as Puck, Robin Goodfellow, and Hobgoblin. He was a goblin who made mischief. 

By the time of Shakespeare and other Elizabethan poets, Puck had become a combination of English folklore and English country life. Shakespeare writes that Puck would frighten the village girls, ruin the butter, and lead travelers in the night the wrong way. Mickey Rooney played Puck in a 1935 movie adaptation of Shakespeare's play. 

Shakespeare used a description of Puck from Reginald Scot's "The Discoverie of Witchcraft" (1584). Scot describes Puck with disapproval. He points out that people no longer believe in him. Scot also tells of a man whose head was replaced with the head of a donkey.

Shylock

Shylock is a key character and the antagonist in Shakespeare's 1596 or 1597 play "The Merchant of Venice". He is a Jewish moneylender.

Shylock agrees to a bond with Antonio, the merchant of Venice. This bond requires Antonio to give a pound of his flesh next his heart should the money not be repaid on a certain date. When Antonio fails, Shylock goes to court to get the pound of flesh. Antonio had previously insulted and spat on him in the Rialto (the commercial centre of Venice). This helps to explain why Shylock demanded his "pound of flesh".

Meanwhile, Shylock's daughter Jessica falls in love with Antonio's friend Lorenzo and converts to Christianity. This adds to Shylock's rage.

Shylock fails in court, and Antonio is released. Shylock is charged with attempted murder. Shylock is then forced to give half of his properties to the country and the other half to Antonio and to convert to Christianity.

Shylock has a famous speech beginning "Hath not a Jew eyes?" Famous actors who have played Shylock include Laurence Olivier.

In Shakespeare's time, no Jews had been "legally" present in England for several hundred years (since Edward I's Edict of Expulsion in 1290). But the idea of Jews as money lenders remained from the Middle Ages. Historically, money lending had been a fairly common occupation among Jews, perhaps because Christians were not allowed to practise usury.

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the year 614 says Cynegils and Cwichelm fought together at a place named Beandun. The account said they slew two thousand sixty-five Welsh. This was a major victory for the West Saxons. Cynegils had some however during the middle of his reign. His son Cwichelm sent someone to try to kill King Edwin of Northumbria. When Edwin attacked Wessex in five Kings of Wessex were killed. The Northumbrian attack weakened the West Saxon army. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 628 says that Cyngils, king of Wessex, and Cwichelm his son 'fought with Penda at Cirencester and came to an agreement with him there'. The 'agreement' seems to have been to give Cirencester to Penda. So this was a defeat for Cynegils and his son Cwichelm and a permanent loss of Cirencester.

In 634 Pope Honorius I sent Bishop Birinus to England. When he reached the territory of the Gewisse (Wessex) he found them almost completely pagan. He began to convert the West Saxons to Christianity. In 635 Cynegils was baptized by Birinus and King Oswald of Northumbria stood as his Godfather. This may have been a condition of the marriage between Oswald and Cynegils's daughter, Cyneburh. He gave Bishop Birinus the city of Dorchester and several churches so he could convert the pagans in Wessex. The conversion took some time to complete and several kings who followed were either pagan or converted to Christianity later in their reigns.

Cwichelm, his son, ruling as either co-king or , died in 636. From that time on Cynegils seems to have ruled Wessex by himself until his death in 643. He was succeeded by his son Cenwalh. Cynegils's reign marked the turning point for Wessex from bands of warriors to the beginnings of a united kingdom.

Cynegils had the following children:


Stingy Jack

Stingy Jack is a character in Irish folklore. He was a poor, dirty man who was often drunk. He outsmarted the devil at least three times.

He invited the devil to have a drink with him. Jack did not want to pay for the drink. He persuaded the devil to change himself into a coin. The devil did so, and Jack put the coin in his pocket. There was a silver cross in his pocket that made it impossible for the devil to return to his original shape. Jack eventually allowed the devil to resume his shape, but only after he promised not to bother Jack for a whole year and to not try to claim his soul when he died.

On another occasion, Jack persuaded the devil to climb an apple tree to gather apples. Jack quickly carved crosses into the trunk of the tree, making it impossible for the devil to come down. Jack allowed the devil to come down, but only after he promised not to bother Jack for ten years and not to claim his soul when he died.

On the third occasion, Jack died before the ten-year time limit. God did not want Jack in Heaven, so he was sent to Hell. The devil could not claim his soul, so Jack was sent back into the world. The devil gave him a glowing coal to light his way in the darkness. Jack put the coal into a hollowed-out turnip. He is said to still walk the earth with his lantern, and can be seen around All Saints Day November 1.

Jack became known as "Jack of the lantern". This name was shortened to "Jack-o'-lantern". In the United States, his lantern became a pumpkin rather than a turnip. Pumpkins were common in the U.S. and easier to carve. The story of Jack is little known, perhaps because he was an unsuitable role model for entertaining children.

Jimmy Hoffa

James Riddle Hoffa (born February 14, 1913 – disappeared July 30, 1975, declared dead July 30, 1982) was an American labor union leader. He was the President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) union from 1958 until 1971. He disappeared in late July 1975, aged 62.

Jimmy Hoffa was born in Brazil, Indiana, on February 14, 1913. His family moved to Detroit in 1924. Hoffa lived in the Detroit area for the rest of his life. His first job was in a grocery store. He worked under an abusive boss, which is what gave him the idea of working with labor unions.

Hoffa left his job in 1932 and was soon working for the Teamsters union. This was mainly a union for truck drivers, though Hoffa never worked as a truck driver himself. He helped grow and manage the union in the Detroit area. In those years, the union was growing quickly.

The Teamsters union had always had links to organized crime, especially the American Mafia. These links grew as the union grew. As Hoffa became more important in the union, he began making agreements with the Mafia.

Hoffa became the head of the Detroit branch of the Teamsters union in 1946. In 1952, he became vice president of the Teamsters Union. In 1957, he then became its president. He would be re-elected in 1961 and 1966.

Under Hoffa, the Teamsters Union continued to grow. In 1964, he helped strike a contract that could cover all truck drivers in the United States. However, both the Teamsters Union and Hoffa were facing investigation for their links to organized crime. Soon after Hoffa became its president, this led to the Teamsters union being forced to leave the AFL-CIO (the main national organization of labor unions).

Hoffa was taken to jail in 1967 for fraud and jury tampering, and sentenced to 13 years. His vice president Frank Fitzsimmons began to run the union instead. In 1971, Fitzsimmons replaced Hoffa as president.

President of the United States Richard Nixon pardoned Hoffa in 1971, but in return, Hoffa could not work for a labor union again until 1980. Despite this, Hoffa began planning to return to leading the Teamsters union. However, he had many opponents, including some members of the Mafia who had once been his friends.

He was married to Josephine Poszywak from 1936 until his disappearance in 1975. They had two children. His daughter Barbara worked as a judge. His son James P. Hoffa has been the leader of the Teamsters union since 1999.

Hoffa vanished on 30 July 1975. He had gone to meet two members of the Mafia at a restaurant near Detroit. He was last seen waiting for them in the restaurant's parking lot.

He was declared legally dead in 1982. His disappearance gave rise to many theories as to what happened to him. Most theories believe that Hoffa was lured away and murdered by his enemies in the Mafia, who then found a way to get rid of his body. Examples of how this could have been done include taking it to a crematorium the Mafia owned or burying it in a hidden place. James Buccellato, an expert on crime, says it is unlikely the body was moved a long distance.

In 2013, the FBI searched a place north of Detroit after hearing news that Hoffa might have been buried there, but they did not find him.



Foreign relations of Bangladesh

The foreign relations of Bangladesh are the Bangladeshi government's policies with other countries. Since independence in 1971, Bangladesh has officially followed a principle of being friendly with all nations and not being enemies with any. As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Bangladesh has tended to not take sides with major powers. Since the end of the Cold War, the country has pursued better relations with its neighbours. It has strong relations with other Muslim countries. It does not recognise Israel.

Bangladesh joined the United Nations in 1974 and was elected to the Security Council in 1978–1980 and again in 2000–02. Foreign Minister Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury was president of the 41st UN General Assembly in 1986.

Bangladesh has played a significant role in international peacekeeping activities. Nearly 10,000 Bangladeshi military personnel are overseas with UN peacekeeping forces. Bangladeshi troops have served or are serving in Somalia, Rwanda, Mozambique, Kuwait, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Haiti, and East Timor. In December 2021, Bangladesh was the largest provider of UN peacekeeping troops with 6608 people followed by Rwanda with 6335.

Myanmar is Bangladesh's eastern neighbour. A great amount of tension exists between the two countries. This is due to border disputes and the presence of over 270,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees in Bangladesh from mainly-Buddhist Myanmar. As a result of bilateral discussions, and with the cooperation and assistance of the UNHCR, most of the Rohingya refugees returned to Burma. As of 2000, about 22,000 refugees remain in camps in southern Bangladesh.

At the 2008 ASEAN Regional forum summit in Singapore, Bangladesh and Myanmar said they would solve their Maritime boundary disputes as quickly as possible especially that a UN deadline in claiming maritime territories would expire in three years time. Both countries discussed the possibility of linking the two countries together in an attempt to boost their trade and commerce relations. The estimate to complete the 25 km highway is three years and at the cost of $20 million. Another aspect of this plan is to connect the highway to the Asian Superhighway which would connect the two countries to China. Although these have not been solved, and tensions are worsening.

The relations between the two are historical, because the British started their conquest of British India from present-day Bengal region of Bangladesh. Bangladesh has been in the Commonwealth since 1972. There are many Bengalis within the community of Great Britain

Gewisse

The Gewisse Latin: "Gewissæ") were a political group or band of Anglo-Saxons. They originally settled in the upper Thames river valley area. The Gewisse were the most powerful group in what would become the kingdom of Wessex.

The name 'Gewisse' comes from an Old English word for "reliable" or "sure", In the genealogy of King Alfred of Wessex, is a supposed ancestor of Cerdic named Gewis. (also spelled Gwis). The true origin of the name cannot be determined accurately. the name was old in Bede's time. Bede stated the original name for the West Saxons was the Gewisse. The change in name from the Gewisse to the West Saxons seems to have taken place in the latter part of the 7th century. The Gewisse, like the 'Cantwara' (Kent-men) and the 'Meonwara' of Hampshire were political units, not tribes.

In 577 the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle claims the kings of the Gewisse captured Cirencester, Bath and Gloucester. The date is questionable but the Gewisse did hold those territories. The Gewisse found themselves limited in their ability to expand into new territories by the growing power of Mercia. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 628 says that Cyngils and Cwichelm his son 'fought with Penda at Cirencester and came to an agreement with him there'. The 'agreement' meant giving Cirencester to Penda. It was a permanent loss of Cirencester. By the second half of the 7th century Gewisse was expanding towards the Southwest and Devon. At about the same time they lost territory in the Thames valley to Mercia. The change in name to Wessex may have reflected more a change in their territory.

Bishop Birinus began converting the Gewisse to Christianity in 634, In 635 he baptized their king Cynegils who established Birinus at Dorchester. But the Dorchester bishopric was never considered West Saxon by Bede. He considered it to be Gewisse. In 660 Cenwalh created a new diocese at Winchester and made Wine the first bishop. Bede referred to the Winchester diocese as West Saxon. At the time he was writing in the early 8th century, Bede treated the two names as interchangeable. But when writing of the reign of Cynegils he referred to them as "anciently known as the Gewissae."

Titration

Titration is a type of quantitative chemical analysis. It is used to work out the unknown concentration of a known substance. 

It makes the use of two main chemical apparatus namely, pipette and burette. External indicators like phenolphthalein or methyl orange and internal indicators like KMnO4 (potassium permanganate) are used to mark the end point of titration.
A known concentration and volume of a reagent, called the "titrant" or "titrator", is added to a known volume of another reagent, the "analyte" or "titrand". This is done slowly from a burette until the end point is reached. The volume added before the end point is reached is noted. Because one of the solutions, the titrant, has a known concentration, that of the other, the titrand, can be calculated.

Professionals now use a pH meter, which is potentiometer with an electrode whose potential depends on the amount of H+ ions in the solution. The pH of the solution is measured throughout the titration, more accurately than with an indicator. At the endpoint there is a sudden change in the measured pH.

Since volume measurements play a key role in titration, it is known as "volumetric analysis" as well as "quantitative analysis".

Diderot effect

The Diderot effect is a phenomenon from sociology, which was named after Denis Diderot, who first described it in an essay. In the essay, Diderot talked about a robe he used to wear in the bathroom: The old robe was a little shabby, but useful. When he was given a new robe, the new robe was more shiny, and nicer, but it did not fit well with the other clothes. 

"Regrets on Parting with My Old Dressing Gown": I was absolute master of my old dressing gown,” Diderot writes, “but I have become a slave to my new one … Beware of the contamination of sudden wealth. The poor man may take his ease without thinking of appearances, but the rich man is always under a strain.

So, the Diderot effect describes that people often show a tendency to buy more goods after they bought one item. It is said that they do this to restore the general perception they had about their belongings.

A gyre is a large system of ocean currents moving in a circle. Gyres are caused by the Coriolis effect. Because the Earth is rotating, ocean currents in the northern hemisphere tend to move in a clockwise direction and currents in the southern hemisphere move in an anti-clockwise direction. 

The Coriolis force acts most strongly on the wind, and the wind then creates a torque that tends to spin the ocean currents.

The Earth rotates from the west towards the east, and the Coriolis effect becomes more intense toward the poles. Because of this, gyres form strong currents on the western side of oceans, so they are pushed against the eastern coast of continents. The vorticity (the strength of the torque force) is balanced out by frictional surface currents, which normally act against the spin of the water. However, in the middle of the ocean, the effects of friction are very weak.

The term "gyre" can be used to mean any type of vortex in the air or the sea, but it is most used in oceanography for the major ocean current systems.

These are the five largest gyres:

Tropical gyres tend to be mostly east-west with minor north-south extent.

The centre of a subtropical gyre is a high pressure area, which the ocean moves around. The high pressure in the centre is due to the westerly winds on the northern side of the gyre and easterly winds on the southern side of the gyre. These cause frictional surface currents towards the latitude at the centre of the gyre.

Subpolar gyres form at high latitudes (around 60°). The ocean moves around a low pressure area. Surface currents generally move outward from the centre of the system.



Striptease (movie)

Striptease is a 1996 comedy-drama movie. "Striptease" is based on a novel by the same name, which was released three years prior to the movie. The stories in this movie are about an exotic dancer who gets involved in serious child custody matters and corrupt politics. Demi Moore is exotic dancer Erin Grant, who was earlier a Federal Bureau of Investigation secretary. Also in the movie is Burt Reynolds as Congressman David Dildeck and Rumer Willis (Moore's real-life daughter) as Erin's daughter Angela. "Striptease" got negative reviews similar to "Showgirls" the previous year. Unlike "Striptease", however, "Showgirls" became a strong cult favorite within one decade after its release.

Goderich, Ontario

Goderich is a town in the Ontario, Canada. It is the county seat of Huron County. The town was founded by William Dunlop in 1827. It is named after Frederick John Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich. The town was officially incorporated in 1850.

The population of Goderich is 7,521 in 2011. The area of the town is 7.91 square kilometers.

Goderich is located on the eastern shore of Lake Huron, at the mouth of the Maitland River. Queen Elizabeth II said that Goderich was "the prettiest town in Canada." But no reigning monarch has ever visited the town. Tourism is important to the local economy. Tourists come for the sunsets over the lake.

Goderich contains many places that are listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places (CRHP). The Huron Historic Gaol is a National Historic Site. It served as the prison of Huron County from its opening in 1842 until 1972.

Davy lamp

The Davy lamp is a safety lamp for use in mines. It was invented in 1815 by Sir Humphry Davy. 

It is a wick lamp with the flame enclosed inside a mesh screen. It was created for use in coal mines, where explosions happened in the presence of methane and other flammable gases. Those gases, called "firedamyp" or "minedamp", did not ignite a shielded flame. The wire mesh put flames out.

The lamp also warned the men of carbon dioxide or methane. The flame would burn higher, and with a blue tinge. Modern versions of the lamp are still used to test mine gases, but the light for working is now electric.


Substance abuse

Substance abuse, or drug abuse, happens when a person uses a drug over and over again, in ways that hurt their health. The person is using the drug to change their mood or to feel better, not for any health reason. Sometimes when the person uses the drug for a long time, they will start to act differently. Some of the drugs are illegal to have or use, or can have certain limits that the person does not follow. Addiction is when people are used to taking a substance, and they feel bad when they are unable to get it. Very often, such people will also change their lives, so they can get the substance or drug they need more easily.

Substance abuse can have different symptoms in different people. “Drug abuse” is not used in the DSM or ICD. In the DSM, the term “substance abuse” is used instead to mean the misuse of one of ten different types of drugs.  A person can also become dependent on drugs. Repetitive use of a drug can cause dependence as well as tolerance. Tolerance happens when it takes more of a drug to produce the same effect than a previous time.

The term “drug misuse” is sometimes used when the drug being used is a prescription medication that is classified as sedatives (medicines that make someone calm), anxiolytics ( make someone less worried or anxious), analgesics (medicines that reduce pain), or stimulants (medicines that give someone more energy). Someone who abuses their drugs may have to illegally buy them from someone who gets them from a doctor.

Not everyone agrees on the definition of substance abuse. Different countries have different rules for what is a drug and what drugs are illegal. People also do not agree about what is abuse. In most Western countries, one glass of wine is acceptable, but drinking more than one bottle at once is abuse. To some people, any drinking can be seen as abuse. In the United States, any use of marijuana

In many cases, when a person is using drugs, their thinking and behaviors change. Sometimes, they commit crimes while using drugs. They may do things that are not safe, like drive a car while drunk. When people abuse drugs over a longer time, their personalities often change as well. The people who abuse drugs are often addicted. Since many of these drugs are illegal, very often drug users have problems with the law.

There are two major ideas about why people abuse drugs. Many people believe that both can be true for different cases or with different people, which is one reason why different treatments work better or worse for different people.

One idea about why people use drugs is because of their genes. When a person's parents or grandparents have been addicted to drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, or even coffee, the same genes that made them become addicted could be passed down to any of their children. When someone is born with genes that increase addiction, it causes their brain and body to become dependent on drugs very quickly. But even if a person's genes make it easier for them to become addicted to drugs, that person still needs to try a drug first, before they can become addicted to it. This idea also means that different people can have a harder or easier time stopping drugs after they are already addicted.

The second major idea is that drug use is a habit that becomes harmful. It is always very hard to stop bad habits, but in this idea, drugs are one of the strongest bad habits because drugs cause so many changes in the brain. Each time a person uses drugs, the parts of the brain that think about drugs become stronger and stronger. In this idea, if a person likes drugs, that person starts to plan their day around using drugs. To stop a habit as strong as drug use, many other things about that person's life must also change. This idea also means that, the longer a person takes drugs, the harder it is for them to stop taking drugs. 

People abuse drugs in many different ways, including:

Some of the most commonly abused "illegal drugs" are:

Some of the most commonly abused "legal drugs and medicines" are:

Alcohol is the most commonly abused substance in the United States. The addiction to alcohol is called alcoholism. There are standardized questionnaires to find out how much alcohol people usually drink, and if they have problems with their drinking habits. Examples are the CAGE questionnaire for adults, or the CRAFFT Screening Test, used for young people. the CRAFFT screening test can also be used to test for other drug-related behavior.

Binge drinking is when someone drinks a large amount of alcohol that goes past the recommended servicing size. Binge drinking is usually done as a group. It is very common at football tailgates and house parties in college. Many people will participate in binge drinking without knowing it, especially when groups are playing drinking games such as "Beer pong" and "Flip cup," where the amounts of alcohol are not regulated. The most dangerous aspect of binge drinking is the potential for serious or fatal injuries that could occur after someone has participated in binge drinking. As binge drinking happens in a group, the people in the group my cause a person to drink more than they should. 

People who abuse drugs have a high rate of suicide. This is because of the changes in the brain caused by drugs, both when they are being used and the changes they cause over time. Another cause is the loss of family and friends because of drug abuse. In the United States, about 30% of all people who perform suicide have abused alcohol at some point.

This table explains more about how some commonly abused drugs relate to depression and suicide:
Treatment of substance abuse can include both therapy and medicine. Therapy for substance abuse helps people not use drugs when they feel they need to. For children and young adults, both the child and the family may have therapy. The child will learn how to not abuse, and the family will learn how to help the child. The organization Alcoholics Anonymous helps people with alcohol abuse.

For some kinds of substance abuse, medicine can be used to help. Some of these medicines, such as methadone, stop the drug from working in the brain. Other medicines can cause people to feel ill if they use the substance that they abuse. Some medicines, like bupropion, makes people stop wanting the drug so much. 

Many substances can cause withdrawal. Withdrawal is a group of bad feelings that happen when someone stops taking a drug suddenly if they were regularly taking that drug before. For someone to have withdrawal, they must be dependent on the drug. Different drugs cause different things to happen during withdrawal. They can also cause different amounts of trouble for the person in withdrawal. Withdrawal from some drugs, like heroin and other opiates, can be dangerous or deadly and should be done with a doctor or nurse taking care of the person in withdrawal.
Like with any other drugs that have been taken regularly, simply stopping to take them may be dangerous. A plan needs to be made on how to stop taking the drug. Actually stopping can take a long time. Sometimes Relapse can also take place and one should be cautious to not let that happen.

About 9% of Americans have a substance abuse issue. Young people are the most likely to experiment with and abuse drugs. Drug abuse affects about 5% of adolescents. More men than women have substance abuse disorder, though women are more likely to have an issue with abusing prescription medication. Children who have parents with substance abuse issues are more likely to have a substance abuse issue when they grow up.

Certain groups of people are more likely to develop substance abuse issues. One group is immigrants or other people who have left their home country. They often have issues in their new country, and some use drugs as a way to feel better.  Another group that is at risk is homeless children. They will use drugs to become closer to each other. A third group that is at risk is musicians. They may use stimulants to make themselves more active and happy. Singers can also hurt themselves if they use drugs that are inhaled.

The first official definition of substance abuse was made in 1932 by the American Psychiatric Association. This definition was only used when the substance was illegal and not being used as medicine. In 1966, the American Medical Association defined abuse as the drug being given by someone to themselves without a doctor.

The first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) had drug abuse as a symptom of other psychological issues. In the third edition, substance abuse was made its own issue. The DSM also has drug abuse as a different issue than drug dependence, which is defined as compulsive use of a drug.

Most countries have laws that make having or using certain drugs illegal. The rules for these drugs can be different between countries or in different parts of the same country. Many drugs that are illegal in several places are sold to make money for groups known as drug cartels.

Drug abuse can also cause issues in a country’s economy. According to the European Union, about 2.5 billion dollars are lost each year because of people abusing drugs. This loss comes from people not going to work or having to go to the hospital because of the side effects of the drug. In the United Kingdom, about 29 billion dollars a year are lost. This number does not include the cost of police or other law enforcement. In the United States, the cost was 181 billion dollars in 2002. This number includes costs because of health issues, loss of work, law enforcement, and welfare programs.

Lorde

Ella Marija Lani Yellich-O'Connor (born 7 November 1996), known by her stage name Lorde, is a New Zealand singer-songwriter. She was signed to Universal Music at the age of 13. Lorde's first album, "Pure Heroine", was released in September 2013. It was followed by "Melodrama" in 2017.

Her first single, "Royals", was released on Republic on 8 March 2013. It reached number one on the US "Billboard" Hot 100, in Canada, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand and number two in Australia. It made her the first solo artist from New Zealand to have a number one in the US. "Royals" also made her the youngest person (age 16) to have a US number one in 26 years. A controversial article on Feministing by Veronica Bayetti Flores described the song 'deeply racist'. Music and culture critic Ed Hightower has offered an appraisal of Lorde's song that rejects Flores' accusation. The song has been covered by Pixie Lott, Neon Jungle, and Mutya Keisha Siobhan.

Her second single "Tennis Court" did not reach the Hot 100. It was a number one in NZ in its first week of release. It made her the first New Zealand artist to have four songs in the top 20 at once.

Her third single "Team" was leaked and then released on 13 September in the US. It reached number 6 on the Hot 100 and number 3 in the NZ top 40. It is one of the songs on "Pure Heroine" that Lorde wrote on her own.

She has released three other promo singles, "Bravado", "Buzzcut Season", and "Ribs". "Million Dollar Bills", "Swingin' Party", and "The Love Club" have also charted.

Her first album "Pure Heroine" was released by Universal Music on 30 September 2013 in the US. Virgin Records released it in the UK in October. It got good reviews from music critics. It reached number one in the iTunes chart in Canada, Australia, the US, and New Zealand. The album was co-written and produced by Joel Little.

She released her first EP, "Love Club", online for free in November 2012. It debuted at number two in Australia and New Zealand and reached twenty-three on the US Billboard 200. It contains 5 songs. The US iTunes version contains "Swingin' Party" as track 2 instead of "Royals". The NZ iTunes version has a bonus track, "Bravado" (Fffrrannno Remix).

Her second EP Tennis Court was released 22 July on Virgin.

Her cover of "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" by Tears for Fears was in the soundtrack. It reached number fourteen in the NZ chart.

In November 2013, she signed with Songs Music to have the rights to her songs. This made her a millionaire. Lorde writes most of her songs with Joe Little, so she owns 50% of the copyright to her songs.

Lorde released a new single on 13 December 2013, called "No Better". It was later included on the extended edition of "Pure Heroine".

In January 2014, the song "Team" had reached the top ten of the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart.

On 3 March 2014, Lorde started a tour in the United States.

In 2017, she appeared on Saturday Night Live.

She had done three tours: "Pure Heroine Tour", which lasted from 2013 to 2014, "Melodrama World Tour", which lasted from 2017 to 2018, and "Solar Power Tour", which started on the 3rd of April 2022, and is expected to end on March the 18th 2023.

Her latest album is 2021's "Solar Power".

Lorde was nominated for four Grammy Awards in December 2013. The nominations were Song of the Year, Record of the Year, Best Pop Solo Performance and Best Pop Vocal Album. She was the youngest person to ever be nominated for Record of the Year. She performed "Royals" at the awards ceremony.

Lorde was born in Takapuna, Auckland. She is a sex positive feminist. In an interview with Huffington Post she said, "I've seen people compare me to just about every female slightly alt[ernative] female musician because people feel the need to put females with other females, which I guess I understand, but I think I'm different because my music is accessible, but it's also smart and those are two things that don't often go together musically."

She was a student at Takapuna Grammar School.



Celtic Britons

The Britons (also called Brythons) were the people who spoke a Celtic language known as Common Brittonic. They lived in Great Britain during the Iron Age, Roman Britain and the Sub-Roman period following the Romans' departure from Britain. Following the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons, who occupied most what is now the country of England, some of the Britons migrated to Wales, Cornwall and southern Scotland, while others moved to Armorica and renamed it Brittany. Those who remained were absorbed into Anglo-Saxon society.

The name of the Britons in the modern English language is borrowed in part from , and in part from the French language of the Middle Ages (). During Roman Britain, the Latin word and its plural, , took the place of the Romans' earlier word for a person from Britain, , and its plural, the . The people of Roman Britain (the Romano-British population) named themselves in Latin. Other people also named the Britons this way: the work of the Roman historian Procopius names them as and in Ireland, the Britons were named the . Some modern Celtic languages also use this form for Britain was well: and .

The Anglo-Saxon historian Bede, writing in Latin, used the name , with the plural "". The "e" vowel in this spelling could be taken from the Anglo-Saxon language's word for the Britons: , also spelled "Britt-", "Bryt", "Brytt"-, "Bret", and "Brit". The Anglo-Saxons probably took this name from the Romano-British. The was a word used in Britain from the 5th century. Whether the Anglo-Saxons took the name "Brett" from the Latin name or from a British word of the same meaning is unknown. The Anglo-Saxons must have started using the word "Brett" by the 6th century. If they had copied the British word at a later time, the word would have had -"th"- instead of -"t"-, like the . In that case, the Old English copy would have had -"þ"- or -"ð"- in the place of -"tt"-.

The name continued to be used in Middle English, with the spellings "Bret", "Brette", "Brettis". Middle English also used the forms "Brut" and "Brutt"-, with the spelling copied from the name of Brutus of Troy. Mythology in the Middle Ages said that Britain was named after Brutus. In Early Modern English, the forms "Brett" and "Britt" were used. The spellings "Bret" and "Brit" were used in Scots.

The first Professor of Celtic at the University of Oxford, John Rhys, was the first person to use the name "Brython" (from ) in academia as another English language word for the Britons. He named the languages of the Britons "Brythonic", or the "Brythonic languages". Rhys used these names to be clear about what he meant, because names like "British" can be ambiguous ("with more than one meaning"). "Brythonic" and "Brythonic languages" are names that are no longer common. The names "Brittonic" and "Brittonic languages" are now more common in linguistics ("the study of languages").

From the Iron Age onward, Britain was divided among a variety of Celtic tribes. When the Romans came, many of the tribes adopted Roman culture and the Latin language.

Clonazepam

Clonazepam is an anticonvulsant. This means it can be used to stop seizures. It is also used to lessen states of fear. It is an anxiolytic. It is a benzodiazepine. Benzodiazepines are very addictive. Clonazepam is used to treat certain forms of epilepsy. It is also used to treat certain disorders of sleep, such as sleepwalking. In certain cases it is used as an off-label drug in psychiatry. It is also used for panic disorders.

Tenant farming

Tenant farming is when the person who works the farmland does not own the land themselves. The farmer pays rent to the landowner, either with cash or with a portion of the produce. When the rent is a share of the crop, it is sharecropping.

Many freed slaves during the Reconstruction of the United States who owned no land became tenant farmers, renting land from a great landowner. 

Hope Springs (2012 movie)

Hope Springs is a 2012 American romantic comedy-drama movie directed by David Frankel and written by Vanessa Taylor. It stars Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones, Mimi Rogers, Jean Smart, and Steve Carell. 

The movie was released on August 8, 2012. It received generally positive reviews and the cast was praised for their performances. It was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, and won a People's Choice Award.

Mockbuster

A mockbuster (also called a knockbuster or a drafting opportunity) is a movie made to take advantage of the publicity of a similar major movie. These types of movies are often made on a low budget. They are made to be released direct-to-video at the same time that the original movie is released in theaters or on video.

Mockbusters are often made to make customers mistakenly buy the movie instead of the one that they wanted. For example, someone may think that they are buying "Transformers", but they are actually buying "Transmorphers", a mockbuster that was released in 2007. Because of this, a mockbuster will often use a title similar to the original movie.

Many mockbusters are made in a different country than the one that the original movie was made in. There are many Turkish, Italian, German, French and Brazilian versions of American movies, as well as sequels that were not made by the people who made the original movie. Animated movie mockbusters are "Spider's Web: A Pig's Tale", a rip-off of "Charlotte's Web"; "Ratatoing", a rip-off of "Ratatouille"); "The Little Panda Fighter" and "Chop Kick Panda", rip-offs of "Kung Fu Panda", and many more movie mockbusters.


Ceol of Wessex

Ceol also spelled Ceola or Ceolric ( 557 — 23 July 597) was the King of Wessex from 592 until his death in 597. His reign is mostly known thanks to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.

Ceol was born on 20 February 557. His father was Cutha, who was the son of King Cynric and the younger brother of Ceawlin who was then crown prince. 

Ceol grew up learning Archery, Science, History, and as well as learning to fight in battles. When Ceol grew older, his battle skills improved and that he quickly rose through the ranks.

In 584, Ceol's father was killed most likely on the orders of Ceawlin who was now king as Cutha attempted to overthrow him in the failed Revolt of 584 as Ceawlin accidentally killed Cutha's wife. Ceol was mad at his uncle for killing his father, who Ceol loved so much. However, Ceawlin exiled Ceol and his family away from Wessex. They lived in exile in Essex.

Seven years later in November 591, Ceol raised troops against Ceawlin in Essex and started another revolt against the king. Ceol and his troops captured every part of Wessex. They captured the many major cities in Wessex including Dorchester and the capital, Winchester. Ceawlin was eventually overthrown and exiled in Tuam, Chonnacht (present-day Ireland).

Ceol, who was now king was crowned on 25 June 592 at Winchester Cathedral. The first thing Ceol did as king was to rebuild the kingdom as it has been destroyed during the rebellion. He ordered the reconstruction of the towns in Wessex that has been damaged.

Ceol then planned to reform the country and improve the literacy rate in the kingdom. He builded more schools for young kids to be educated. He also expanded the army and the navy of Wessex. He also created peace with neighbouring countries and as well as stabilising Wessex. However, for those who opposed his rule, Ceol would put them in prison. Thus Ceol became controversial and many people began opposing his rule.

Because Ceol became super controversial and would put many people in prison, his younger brother, Ceolwulf started a revolt against Ceol and killed him. Ceolwulf eventually became the new king.
Ceol has a great reputation. During his rule, Wessex became more powerful and the people would experience peace and prosperity. His son Cynegils would go on to become the King of Wessex after Ceol's younger brother, Ceolwulf died in 611. Ceol was considered a great and a solid king.

The Million Second Quiz

The Million Second Quiz is an American television game show. It aired on NBC from September 9 to September 19, 2013. It follows a group of contestants who compete for up to $2 million in a game show that lasts for 1,000,000 seconds (or 11 days, 13 hours, 46 minutes, and 40 seconds). NBC aired the show for one hour each day (except for Sunday the 15th, and the final episode was two hours), while the rest of the show aired on the "Million Dollar Quiz" internet application and NBC.com. It is hosted by Ryan Seacrest.

The show takes place in a large hourglass-shaped structure in Midtown Manhattan near the Lincoln Tunnel. Contestants play for 24 hours a day for 1,000,000 seconds, or around eleven and a half days. At any given time, a contestant is sitting in the "Money Chair" and earning money, while defending his/her position in the chair in bouts against another contestant. Contestants earn $10 a second they are in the chair, even when bouts are not being played and during commercial breaks. Only the four contestants with the highest amount of money keep their winnings when the million seconds are up.

Each bout lasts for a set number of seconds. All questions are multiple choice with four possible answers. Contestants use keypads to lock in their answers. The players cannot see each other's answers. They have five seconds to do so when the question is asked.

During the episodes that are seen on television, there are three bouts: the "Challenger" bout (300 seconds, or 5 minutes), the "Line Jumper" bout (300 seconds in the first episode, 400 seconds, or 6 minutes 40 seconds, from the second episode on), and the Winner's Defense" bout (400 seconds in the first through ninth episodes, 500 seconds, or 8 minutes 20 seconds, in the 10th episode). Questions start at one point each. Every 100 seconds, the value of the questions increase by one point.

At any time, a contestant may choose to "double" instead of answering the question. If the contestant does so, the question's value is doubled, and the opponent has to either answer the question or "double back", which quadruples the point value and forces the person who the question was given to answer. If a doubled or doubled-back contestant answers incorrectly or does not answer in five seconds, the opponent gets the points. Contestants can choose to double as often as they want during a bout.

At the end of a bout, the contestant with the higher score wins and either stays in the "Money Chair" or replaces the current contestant in it. If both contestants have the same number of points at the end of a bout, a question is asked, and the contestant who answers correctly first wins the bout. If both contestants answer incorrectly, the contestant with the higher amount of money wins.

The "Challenger" bout has a contestant who has successfully gone through an on-site tryout process. The "Line Jumper" bout has a contestant who has gotten a high enough score on the "Million Second Quiz" internet application, allowing them to skip the tryout and go on the show.

The four contestants with the most amount of money live in the "Winners' Row". This is a living area that is set up next to the hourglass. They are at risk of being replaced if another contestant gets a higher score than them. During a "Winner's Defense" bout, the current "Power Player" (the contestant who had the highest number of correct answers playing along in "Winners' Row" that day) chooses one of the four "Winners' Row" contestants, who can be him/herself, to play against the contestant who is currently in the "Money Chair". The winner gets all of the loser's winnings in addition to their own winnings, while the loser is out of the game.

Bouts that are not shown on television last for 500 seconds. Every question is worth one point. Contestants cannot double in these bouts. Four bouts are played in an hour; with a five-minute pause after each of the first three. The fourth bout is followed by an 11-minute break. During this time, a contestant may eat, drink, or use the bathroom. Contestants earn money during the five-minute pauses, but not during the 11-minute break.

After 1,000,000 seconds, the four contestants with the most amount of money keep all of the winnings they have earned. They face in a series of three bouts, which are as follows:


The winner of the third bout wins $2,000,000.

C major

C major is a major scale based on C, which is made up of the pitches C,D,E,F,G,A,B. Its key signature has no flats or sharps.

Its relative minor is A minor, and its parallel minor is C minor. A scale in both C major and A minor can be played on a piano or other keyboard instrument using only the white keys.

Most of the time key signatures were cancelled whenever the new key signature had fewer sharps or flats than the old key signature, in modern popular music, this is only done when C major or A minor replace another key.

Geoffroi de Charny

The Oriflamme was the Kings banner and this was a great honor given to a knight by the King. He was also one of the Knights chosen to fight close to and protect the King. De Charny was said to be a "true and perfect Knight".

Jean de Joinville was de Charny's grandfather's. He was a close friend of King Louis IX and author of his biography. In the same tradition, Sir Geoffroi wrote three books in his time. His most famous book was "A Knight's Own Book of Chivalry". In this book he shared his great skill and knowledge of combat. The second book written by de Charny is entitled, "Requests (or Questions) for jousting tournaments and war". It was written about 1352 to the Knights of the Order of the Star which Sir Geoffroi founded. This book was written in the form of questions. His third book was the book "Charny", describes the life of a knight and lists the qualities a good knight must possess.

Charny fought in Flanders and Tournay. He was taken prisoner but was ransomed because the King considered him so important. He fought in many major battles during the Hundred Years' War such as the battles of Calais, Crecy and Poitiers.

Sir John Chandos was a close friend and biographer of Edward, the Black Prince, the eldest son of King Edward III of England. Chandos was a famous knight himself. He was an educated man and wrote down the events of a great meeting of both sides before the Battle of Poitiers. He wrote that at that meeting Sir Geoffroi tried to avoid a great bloodshed by proposing a smaller battle where 100 knights on each side would do battle with each other and the outcome would decide the battle. Chandos writes that Charny was trying to find an honorable solution to avoid a great many more deaths. The Black Prince refused that offer. Charny’s predictions turned out to be true and indeed a great many nobles on both sides lost their life that day, including de Charny himself.

Charny died at the Battle of Poitiers while protecting the King.

Historical records seem to indicate that a shroud bearing an image of a crucified man (represented in the Pilgrim Badge shown here) existed in the small town of Lirey in France around the years 1353 to 1357 in the possession of Geoffroi de Charny. The cloth itself is controversial. Some believe it is a fake, while others believe the shroud to be the true burial cloth of Jesus Christ.

Mixtape

A mixtape (or mixed-tape) is any compilation of songs recorded onto a cassette tape or other storage medium. A mixtape usually shows the kind of music that the person who made it likes to listen to.

Since the 1990s, the term "mixtape" can also describe releases used to promote one or more new musical artists, or as a pre-release by more established artists to promote upcoming albums.

Harrow (tool)

A harrow is a farm tool. It is an implement for breaking up and smoothing out the surface of the soil. In this way it is different from a plow, which cuts deeper into the soil. A plow also lifts up the soil and tips it over, but a harrow works mostly by cutting into the soil and breaking it up. Harrowing is often carried out on fields to follow the rough surface left by plowing. 

The purpose of this harrowing is generally to break up clods (lumps of soil) and to provide a finer finish, a good tilth or soil structure that is good for planting seeds. It may also be used to remove weeds and to cover up seed after sowing. 

Harrows differ from cultivators in that they disturb the whole surface of the soil, instead of disturbing only narrow trails that avoid crop rows (to kill weeds).

There are four general types of harrows: disc harrow, tine harrow, chain harrow and chain disk harrows. Harrows were originally pulled by draft animals, such as horses, mules, or oxen, or in some times and places by people. In modern practice they are almost always pulled by tractors, either from a drawbar or mounted on the three-point hitch.

Harrows may be of several types and weights, depending on their purpose. They almost always consist of a rigid frame that holds discs, teeth, linked chains, or other means of moving soil—but tine and chain harrows are often only supported by a bar at the front of the set.





Depending on the type of soil and the crop being planted, one or more types of harrows may be used to get the soil ready for planting. If the soil is very light so that it might easily be wind-blown, a roller can be used at the end to settle it.

A "drag" is a name for a heavy harrow, often a chain type.

Ceawlin of Wessex

Ceawlin (also spelled Ceaulin, Caelin and Celin; 27 February 530 — 25 April 593) was the King of Wessex from 560 until in 592 where he was overthrown by his nephew, Ceol, who became his successor. His reign is mostly known thanks to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. It was said that Ceawlin was very active fighting in battles. It was also said that it was during Ceawlin's reign where Wessex greatly expanded.

Ceawlin was the son of Cynric. He is mentioned as fighting alongside his father against the Bretons at Branbury in 556. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Ceawlin became king of the West Saxons in 560. Bede states Ceawlin was the second king to rule the southern English as overlord. The informal term for a king that ruled over other kings was "". The term comes from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and means 'Britain ruler'. These overkings typically received from other Anglo-Saxon kings in the south.

In 577 Ceawlin, with his son Cuthwine, led the Gewisse against the Britons at 'Deorham' (Dyrham in Gloucestershire). They reportedly killed three kings, Coinmail, Condidan, and Farinmail. Ceawlin and Cuthwine captured Gloucester, Cirencester and Bath. West Saxons then colonized the lower Severn valley. The importance of this victory was that it gave the West Saxons access to the western sea. This also divided the Britons so they could no longer communicate by land. But it was territory later Wessex kings would not be able to hold. In 584 Ceawlin defeated the Britons at Fethanlea (Oxfordshire) but his ally Cutha was killed there.

About 592 Ceawlin fought a battle at Woddesbeorg (or Wodnesbeorg) also called Adam's Grave, east of Devizes in Wiltshire. There was a 'great slaughter' but nothing was said as to who he fought; Britons or Anglo-Saxons. But it was over this loss that Ceawlin was driven out of power. His nephew Ceol replaced him as king in 592. Ceawlin died in 593. At the end of his reign, the Gewisse or West Saxons held the lands of Berkshire, Wiltshire, Hampshire and much of Gloucestershire.

Daylighting (using windows, skylights, or light shelves) is sometimes used as the main source of light during daytime in buildings. This can save energy in place of using artificial lighting, which represents a major component of energy consumption in buildings. Lighting is a major factor in photography, movie making and television studios.

Cerdic of Wessex

Cerdic (died 534) was the first Anglo Saxon King of the Gewisse, also called the King of Wessex. He was the ancestor of the kings of Wessex and the Anglo-Saxon kings of England beginning with Athelstan.

According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Cerdic, along with his son Cynric, came to Britain in 495. Their three ships landed at Cerdic's ora fought the Britons there on the same day. Most of what is known about Cerdic comes from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. In 519 he and his son defeated Britons at Cerdic's ford and took Wessex. In 527 at a place called Cerdic's leaga Cerdic and Cynric battled with the Britons again. In 530 they conquered the Isle of Wight. The record for 534 states that Cerdic died this year. Cerdic was succeeded by his son Cynric.

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle gave Cenred a pedigree going back to the Saxon god Woden. But historian Kenneth Sisam 
showed this legendary pedigree was "borrowed" from the Kings of Bernicia and was not historic. But archaeological evidence shows that outside of Kent and Sussex, the main area of settlement was in the upper Thames Valley. This agrees with much of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle although dates are harder to verify.

It should be noted that the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is not a reliable document for the period contemporary to Cerdic's supposed reign. It should also be noted that Cerdic is a British name and not an Anglo-Saxon name. It is also unlikely that Wessex was the name of his proposed kingdom. Ultimately, Cerdic should be considered as mythology.

Cerdic had:



Euler characteristic

In mathematics, the Euler characteristic of a shape is a number that describes a topological space, so that anything in the space will have the same number. It is calculated by taking the number of points in the shape, the number of lines in the shape, and the number of faces of the shape. One can find the Euler characteristic with this formula:

where "V" is the point count, "E" the line count, and "F" the face count. For most common shapes (convex polyhedron), the Euler characteristic is 2.
For spheres, the Euler characteristic is also 2.

Notre Dame Stadium

Notre Dame Stadium is the home football stadium for the University of Notre Dame. The university's football team are the Fighting Irish. The stadium is located on the university's campus in Notre Dame, Indiana, just north of the city of South Bend. It was opened in 1930. The stadium can seat over 80,000 people.

The stadium opened in 1930. It replaced the old stadium Cartier Field. It cost more than US$750,000 to build. The head coach of the Fighting Irish, Knute Rockne, played an important role in the design of the stadium. The design was based on Michigan Stadium. The stadium originally held 54,000 people. It measured a half-mile (0.8 kilometres) in circumference and stood high. It was built by the Sollitt Construction Company of South Bend. They began building in April 1930, and took six months to build. The Irish played their first game in the new stadium on 4 October 1930. They beat the SMU Mustangs 20–14. The official dedication was on October 11 against Navy.

Over the years, the stadium's seating capacity was gradually increased to 59,075. This was mainly done by making most of the seats smaller. In 1997, 21,000 new seats were added to the stadium, bringing the seating capacity to the present 80,795. Permanent lights were also installed. The lights were paid for by NBC, which has held the exclusive television rights to all home games since 1991.

The playing surface was natural grass throughout the stadium's history until FieldTurf, an advanced artificial surface, was installed before the 2014 football season.

The stadium is known for its view of "Touchdown Jesus" (actually titled "The Word of Life"), a large mural of the resurrected Jesus. The mural is painted on the southern exterior wall of the Hesburgh Library. It is high and wide. It can be seen over the northern end zone of the stadium. The mural was designed by Millard Sheets and was constructed in 1964. It cost US$200,000. It is contains 81 types of stone from 16 countries, and is composed of hundreds of panels which incorporate 6,700 pieces of granite.

In 1997, fans protested the university's plans to add 20,000 seats to the stadium. These seats would have blocked the view of "Touchdown Jesus" from the field. The university then considered limiting seats in the end zone. For aesthetic reasons however, developers went with a larger bowl all the way around. As a result, the view of "Touchdown Jesus" was partially blocked.

Father of the Pride

Father of the Pride is an American animated television series. The series is based on Siegfried & Roy's performances.

The animation was produced by Imagi Animation Studios.

The family was conceived by Katzenberg when he visited Siegfried & Roy's Secret Garden in Las Vegas in 2002. The series only ran for one season.

The show revolves around the adventures of a family of white lions, consisting of father Larry, the bumbling yet well-intentioned star of Siegfried & Roy's show; Kate, a pretty, stay-at-home mother who is a member of a special women's group; Sierra, their teenage daughter who is constantly annoyed by her family; Hunter, their awkward young son, who is a huge fan of "Lord of the Rings"; Sarmoti, Kate's father and Sierra and Hunter's grandfather who has an annoyance for Larry; and Snack, Larry's mischievous gopher friend.

Recurring characters appear alongside the lion family; these include Larry's friends Roger, Chutney, Vincent, and Nelson; Larry's rival Blake and his wife Victoria; Sarmoti's friends Bernie, Duke, Chaz, and the Snout Brothers; Hi Larious; Kate's friends Foo-Lin, Lily, and Brittany; two lesbian gophers Chimmi & Changa; and Sierra's boyfriend Justin.

The primary setting of "Father of the Pride" is Las Vegas, Nevada.

It took more than 200 animators 2 years to make "Father of the Pride". Computer animation was produced at Imagi Animation Studios in Hong Kong.

The series employed a small group of seasoned directors, which included Mark Risley, Bret Haaland, Steve Hickner, John Holmquist, John Stevenson, and Mark Baldo. Felix Ip served as creative director for Imagi. For the first season, DreamWorks created 30 principal sets, 500 special props, and about 100 characters. In fact, a typical episode unfolds across all 30 principal sets and features two or three unique locations as well. The lion habitat is inspired by the real Secret Garden in Las Vegas, where the actual Siegfried & Roy lions reside. In "Father of the Pride", the Secret Garden has residences for the main characters and their families and public areas ranging from the community bar to a school classroom.

Since Larry and his family drive the story lines for most of the episodes, their residence is the most detailed, with separate sets for the living room, the kitchen, and the children's bedrooms. Meanwhile, the assets are stored in individual files in order to be loaded into separate layers and assembled modularly.

Rod Grams

Rodney Dwight "Rod" Grams (February 4, 1948 – October 8, 2013) was a politician from Minnesota and a radio personality. He served as a Republican in both the United States House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Grams first began as a TV News anchor, but quit his job in order to run for the senate.

Grams was born in Princeton, Minnesota and attended Brown Institute, 1966–8, Anoka-Ramsey Community College, 1970–2, and Carroll College, 1974–5.

After David Durenberger announced he would not seek reelection, Grams surprised many by announcing, just months into beginning his first term in the US House, that he would run for the US Senate. However, Grams faced opposition for the Republican party endorsement from State Senator Gen Olson, Bert McKasy (former chief of staff to David Durenberger), and Doug McFarland.

In the general election against Democratic Farm Labor candidate Ann Wynia and Independence Party candidate Dean Barkley, Grams won a close election to become Minnesota's next US Senator.

Grams ran for re-election in 2000 as the incumbent, losing to Mark Dayton. During the campaign, Grams' wife Christine Gunhus was revealed to have written anonymous disparaging emails about Grams' potential Democratic rival, Mike Ciresi, from her home computer. She received a fine and suspended sentence for violating political advertising regulations.

Grams was married to Christine Gunhus until his death in 2013. On September 4, 2013 it was announced that Grams had been battling cancer since 2012 and had entered hospice care.

Grams died of colon cancer on October 8, 2013 at his home in Crown, Minnesota.

Arrondissements of the Côte-d'Or department

There are 3 arrondissements in the Côte-d'Or department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into "arrondissements", which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture.

If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture.

Arrondissements are further divided into communes.

The arrondissements of Côte-d'Or are:

Since its creation, the Côte-d'Or department has had few changes:


Agilbert

Agilbert (flourished 650–) was Frankish by birth and educated in Ireland. He became the second Bishop to the West Saxons after Bishop Birinus. Following a disagreement with king Cenwalh of Wessex he returned to Gaul to eventually become the Bishop of Paris.
Agilbert studied in Ireland for several years. In 650 he came to Wessex as a . Cenwalh, the king, was impressed by his background he offered Agilbert the of Dorchester. This was the seat originally given to Bishop Birinus who founded a church at Dorchester on Thames. Birinus had died in 650 and Cenwalh was looking for a replacement. But after some time Cenwalh grew tired of not being able to understand the bishop, who apparently did not speak the Anglo-Saxon language. Cenwalh created a new diocese at Winchester in 660 and made Wine the first bishop. Agribert took offense at not being consulted and left his see.

Agilbert did not leave England immediately but visited Northumbria. 
A controversy had occurred in the Northumbrian church over the date of Easter. The king Oswiu of Northumbria and his son Eahlfrith each backed a different church position. Why Agilbert came to Northumbria at this time or who sent him is not recorded. But kings Osiwu and Cenwalh were friends. They both supported the Roman position that Easter should be celebrated the same throughout the Christian world. A synod was called at Whitby to settle the issue. Bishop Agilbert was the senior there who supported the Roman position. As he did not speak the language well, he asked Wilfrid to speak for him. Their argument was why did only the remote parts of Britain celebrate Easter differently than the remainder of the Christian world? Osiwu made a decision to celebrate Easter with the rest of the Christian churches.

Agilbert wandered in Gaul (later France) for a time before accepting the position of Bishop of Paris. He held that position from for about 12 years. He consecrated Wilfrid as a bishop at Compiègne along with several others. Later Bishop Wine was expelled from Wessex by Cenwalh. This left Wessex without a bishop. Cenwalh sent appeals to Agilbert to return to Wessex. Agilbert turned Cenwalh down saying his current duties as bishop of Paris prevented his return. But he sent his nephew Leutherius in his place. Leutherius was welcomed in Wessex as the new bishop of Winchester. Agilbert died sometime after 679. He was buried at the monastery of Jouarre.

Nicholas Oresko

Nicholas Oresko (January 18, 1917 – October 4, 2013) was a United States Army veteran and a recipient of the United States military's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his actions on 23 January 1945, during World War II.

Oresko was born on January 18, 1917, in Bayonne, New Jersey. He had Ukrainian family. Oresko later joined the Army from that city in March 1942. 

Following the death of Barney F. Hajiro in January 2011, Oresko became the oldest living Medal of Honor recipient. Oresko lived in Cresskill, New Jersey. Bayonne School #14 was renamed in his honor in July 2010.

Oresko died while undergoing surgery for a broken femur on October 4, 2013 in Englewood, New Jersey. He was 96 years old.

Siegfried &amp; Roy

Siegfried Tyron Fischbacher (June 13, 1939 – January 13, 2021) and Roy Horn (Uwe Ludwig Horn; October 3, 1944 – May 8, 2020) were German-American magicians and entertainers, best known for their acts with white lions and white tigers in Las Vegas, Nevada. They were born and raised in Germany, then moved to the United States and became U.S. citizens. From August 2004 to May 2005, Fischbacher and Horn were executive producers of "Father of the Pride".

Fischbacher and Horn were born and raised in Germany. They emigrated to the United States and became naturalized citizens. 

Siegfried was born Siegfried Tyron Fischbacher in Rosenheim on June 13, 1939, to Martin and Maria Fischbacher. His mother was a housewife, and his father was a professional painter who during World War II ended up as a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union. Fischbacher purchased a magic book as a child and began to practice illusions. He moved to Italy in 1956 and started work at a hotel.

Eventually, Fischbacher found work performing magic on the ship TS "Bremen" under the stage name Delmare. While performing aboard the ship he met Horn and asked him to help during a show. Fischbacher and Horn were fired from the TS "Bremen" for bringing a live cheetah onto the ship, but were scouted by a cruise line based in New York and began performing together as a duo.

Roy was born Uwe Ludwig Horn on October 3, 1944, in Nordenham, in the midst of bomb attacks, to Johanna Horn. His father died in World War II, and his mother married a construction worker after the war ended. She later began work in a factory. Horn had three brothers: Manfred, Alfred, and Werner. Horn became interested in animals at a very young age and cared for his childhood dog named Hexe (witch). Horn's mother's friend's husband Emil was the founder of the Bremen Zoo, which gave Horn access to exotic animals from the age of 10. Horn left school at age 13. He worked as a waiter on the cruise ship "Bremen", where he met Fischbacher and launched his performance career.

The owner of the Astoria Theatre in Bremen saw Fischbacher and Horn's act aboard a Caribbean cruise ship and got them to perform at her nightclub. This launched a career for the pair on the European nightclub circuit, and they began to perform with tigers. They were discovered performing in Paris by Tony Azzie, who asked them to come to Las Vegas in 1967. They spent some time in Puerto Rico and may have purchased property there.

In 1981, Ken Feld of Irvin & Kenneth Feld Productions started the "Beyond Belief" show with them at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino. A version of the show was taken on a world tour in the third quarter of 1988.

During a period of their careers, Fischbacher and Horn were romantically involved, though they avoided discussion of their private lives.

During a show at the Mirage on Horn's birthday on October 3, 2003, a 7-year-old white tiger named Montecore attacked Horn. As part of the act, but veering off script, Horn held his microphone to Montecore's mouth and told him to say "hello" to the audience. Montecore responded by biting Horn's sleeve. Horn swatted the tiger and barked "release!". Suffering from dizziness, Horn tripped and fell onto his back, and Montecore moved to stand over him. As standby trainers rushed in from offstage to assist, Montecore bit into Horn's neck and dragged him offstage. Trainers got the tiger to release Horn by spraying him with CO fire extinguisher canisters, the last resort available.

The attack severed Horn's spine, drained his blood, and severely injured other parts of his body, permanently impairing his motor and verbal abilities. He also had a stroke either before or after Montecore dragged him offstage. While being taken to the hospital, Horn stated, "Montecore is a great cat. Make sure no harm comes to Montecore." He told "People Magazine" in September 2004 that Montecore saved his life by trying to drag him to safety after he had a stroke. The incident prompted the Mirage to close the show, which had 267 cast and crew members.

Trainer Chris Lawrence later refuted Fischbacher and Horn's explanations for why the tiger attacked Horn, alleging it was due to Horn's mishandling of Montecore. The duo dismissed Lawrence's claims, stating he "had problems with his life anyway." Lawrence later said he believed that the duo and the Mirage covered up the real reason for the attack in order to protect their image.

In August 2004, their act became the basis for "Father of the Pride". Right before its release, the series was almost cancelled until Fischbacher and Horn urged NBC to continue production after Horn's condition improved after the attack by Montecore in October 2003. By March 2006, Horn was talking and walking, with assistance from Fischbacher, and appeared on Pat O'Brien's television news program "The Insider" to discuss his daily rehabilitation. 

In February 2009, the duo staged a final appearance with Montecore as a benefit for the Lou Ruvo Brain Institute (though Chris Lawrence had stated this performance involved a different tiger). Their performance was recorded for broadcast on ABC television's "20/20" program.

On April 23, 2010, Fischbacher and Horn retired from show business. "The last time we closed, we didn't have a lot of warning", said longtime manager Bernie Yuman. "This is farewell. This is the dot at the end of the sentence."

On March 19, 2014, Montecore died after a brief illness. He was 17 years old.

In June 2016, director Philipp Stölzl announced that Fischbacher and Horn would produce a biopic film documenting their lives. Following Horn's death in 2020, this did not happen.

On April 28, 2020, Horn's publicist stated he "tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 and is currently responding well to treatment". However, his condition deteriorated and he died at the age of 75 on May 8, 2020 at Mountain View Hospital in Las Vegas. The duo's spokesman, Dave Kirvin, announced Horn's death and said it was due to complications from the disease. Fischbacher stated that "the world has lost one of the greats of magic, but I have lost my best friend".

Horn was cremated and Fischbacher stated he would keep his ashes in an urn.

On January 12, 2021, Fischbacher announced he had terminal pancreatic cancer. He died the next day in Las Vegas from the disease at the age of 81.

List of road routes in New South Wales

Major roads in New South Wales are organised into many routes. These help drivers to navigate their way between places in the state. Each route is given its own route number. The number consists of a letter (M, A or B) and a one- or two-digit number. 'M' routes are motorways, 'A' routes are national routes, and 'B' routes are state routes. The route system includes highways, motorways, and other important roads that have not been declared highways.

Route numbers have been allocated to roads in New South Wales since 1955. To supplement the national route number system, three "ring roads" were built in Sydney in 1964. These were numbered 1, 3 and 5. In 1973, a system of numbering freeways was introduced to New South Wales to complement the national routes and ring roads. In 1974, the National Highway network was defined, which in New South Wales included the Hume Highway, Federal Highway, Barton Highway, Sydney-Newcastle Freeway (now Pacific Motorway) and New England Highway. In 1993, Sydney's Metroad system was introduced.

In 2013, the state replaced its entire system of State Routes, National Routes, National Highways and Metroads with a new route numbering system of letters and numbers. The roads no longer uses National Highway shields on any route. This new system of routes are the routes that are listed below.

Fragile X syndrome

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic syndrome that causes a range of intellectual disabilities as well as unusual physical and behavioural characteristics. Males and females can have FXS but it is more common, and often more serious, in males. It is one of the most common causes of autism and intellectual disability among boys. Individuals with this condition lack an important gene product.

Fragile X syndrome occurs as a result of a mutation of the "FMR1" gene on the X chromosome. This causes an increase an increase in the number of CGG repeats in the 5' untranslated region of "FMR1". 

In unaffected individuals, the "FMR1" gene contains 5–44 repeats of the CGG codon, most commonly 29 or 30 repeats. Between 45 and 54 repeats is considered a "grey zone". Between 55 and 200 repeats in length is described as a premutation allele. Individuals with fragile X syndrome have a full mutation of the "FMR1" allele, with over 200 repeats of the CGG codon. 

In these individuals with a repeat expansion greater than 200, there is methylation of the CGG repeat expansion and "FMR1" promoter. This silences the "FMR1" gene, and its end-product is not made.

Consumer protection

Consumer protection means protecting the rights of consumers. It also helps to protect fair trade competition and truthful information in a market economy. Various laws and organisations are designed to do this. 

The laws are designed to stop companies using unfair practices to gain an advantage over their competitors. Examples of such practices are fraud and "false advertising", where a company advertises their product with false information. 

Consumer protection laws are a form of regulation.

Lubricant

A lubricant is a substance used to reduce friction between moving surfaces. The property of reducing friction is known as "lubricity" (slipperiness).

A good lubricant has the following characteristics:


The most often used lubricant is motor oil, which is used in engines of cars and motorcycles.

Sometimes, chemicals are added to normal oil to give it special properties. A lubricant, like motor oil, can also help in reducing heat. Simply put, cooling depends on surface area in contact. So, if something normally has a small surface area, you can put that thing into a bigger pot, and put oil in the pot. This way, oil comes in contact with small surface area of the small object, and transfers that heat to the big surface area of the big vessel. As a rule, liquids can transfer heat better than gases.

In manufacturing, sometimes oil is used to cool the item being made. This also helps in removing metal that was just chipped off. This chipped-off metal normally flows with the oil until it is filtered. Then the oil is reused. The filtered metal chips are normally scrapped.

Sometimes, lubricants are used for hydraulic machines. A hydraulic machine uses the fact that the hydraulic oil cannot be compressed, and performs a simple conversion – it works like a lever.

Some common lubricants are:

Oils can cause pollution, especially water pollution, if released into the open.

Picts

The Picts were ancient Celtic people from northern and eastern Scotland. 

They are first mentioned in written records in AD 297, before the Roman conquest of Britain. The name 'Pict' is from the Latin "pictus" meaning 'painted.' This may have been due to reports from the Romans that the Picts on their bodies, along with reports that ancient Celtic Britons during Roman times would paint themselves various terms that are now translated as "woad", but originally may have meant "glass" and "green" ("vitrum" and "glastum", respectively). This process is described as staining the skin of battle wounds a dark color, since woad is a powerful astringent. It may also refer to a name they called themselves, that was recorded by the Romans. 

They spoke a Pictish language. It was related to the Brythonic languages spoken by the Britons living to the south. Picts were possibly the of the Caledonians and other tribes that were mentioned by Roman historians. 

The area of Scotland called gradually merged with the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata. This formed the kingdom of Alba, later known as Scotland. Alba then expanded, absorbing the British kingdom of Strathclyde and Bernician Lothian. By the 11th century the Pictish identity had become a part of the Scottish people.

Pennacook

The Pennacook (or Pawtucket) were a Native American people in North America. They lived along the Merrimack River in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. They spoke an Algonquian language.

When the English colonists arrived, the Pennacook fled north with the Abenaki, or west with other tribes. Those that went west were hunted down and killed by colonists. Those that fled northward eventually merged with other displaced tribes from New England.

Owain Glyndŵr

Owain Glyndŵr (also known as Owain Glyn Dŵr and Owen Glendower), (c. 1355 – c. 1415) was the last person born in Wales to be Prince of Wales. He was prince between 1401 and 1416. He started the Welsh Revolt against Henry IV of England's rule of Wales. In the late 19th century, the Young Wales (Cymru Fydd) movement decided that he was the father of Welsh nationalism. Since then, he has been seen as a hero by the Welsh. There is a university in Wales that is called Glyndŵr University after him.

Glyndŵr was born into an Anglo-Welsh family in about 1355. His family were reasonably rich and had large properties in the north east of Wales. He was educated in England, and later joined the English army. He took part in an attack on Scotland, and then later went back to Wales. After Richard II was overthrown by Henry IV there was a period of confusion, and Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn took the opportunity to take some of Glyndŵr's lands. Grey was a supporter of Henry IV, while Glyndŵr had supported Richard II.

Glyndŵr sought help from Henry IV to deal with his land being taken, but Henry refused to take action against his supporters. Glyndŵr also failed to supply soldiers to the king for another attack on Scotland. Grey called him a traitor. Glyndŵr decided to take action against Henry IV. He gave himself the title of Prince of Wales in September 1400, and began a series of attacks against Grey and towns along the borders with England. Henry IV sent his army to Wales to fight Glyndŵr and regain control, but it had the opposite effect. It became a widespread rebellion against England.

In April 1401 Glyndŵr's army captured Conwy Castle. The next year, at the Battle of Bryn Glas, also known as the Battle of Pillethl, Glyndŵr defeated the English army, and captured its leader, Edmund Mortimer. By 1404 a French army had landed, and together with the Welsh army they attacked Worcester.

By 1408 the English forces were able to defeat the Welsh, and support for the rebellion collapsed. Glyndŵr still kept up attacks and raids on the English, but this was more of a guerrilla campaign than a full scale revolt. The last mention of Glyndŵr is when the English offered terms if he surrendered in 1416. It is believed that he was already dead.

Owain married Margaret Hanmer (). Her father was Sir David Hanmer. Margaret had five sons and four daughters with Owain. These children were:


All of Owain's sons either died while fighting in war, taken prisoner and died as prisoners, or died with no children of their own. Owain also had children from other women who were not his wife. They were named: David, Gwenllian, Ieuan, and Myfanwy.

After Owain died, most people did not care if the English people ruled the country anymore. During the time of the Tudor's, men from Wales, called Welshmen, started to become more famous in English society.

Many people forgot about how important Owain was until the 1800s, when people started to celebrate his life. The "Young Wales" group made him the symbol of Welsh nationalism. Things that were owned by Owain were found in the National Library of France during this time period. They found his "Great Seal" and letters he had written to French people. A statue of him was made and put at Cardiff City Hall during World War I. Postcards were sold with Owain on them. The postcards were sold to make money to help soldiers who were injured in war. 

In 1808, the Royal Navy named a Fifth-rate frigate after Owain. It was called the HMS "Owen Glendower". The boat served in the Gunboat War. It helped take over the island of Anholt. During the years 1822 and 1824, the boat was in the West Africa Squadron, where it chased slave ships. It captured two ships. 

Nationally, Owain is as famous as King Arthur. Organizations use his name and drawings of him as their symbols to celebrate Wales as a country and Welsh culture. In the 1980s, a group of people called "Meibion Glyndŵr" burned down vacation homes owned by English people. They used Owain as their logo. In the year 2000, parties were held across Wales to celebrate the 600th anniversary of Owain's revolt. In 1974 and 2008, stamps were made with Owain on them. There is an award that is given every year for arts and writing called the Glyndŵr Award. The band Manic Street Preachers wrote a song about Owain in 2007 called "1404". There are many statues throughout Wales of Owain. 

There is a building at the University of Cape Town, called Glendower Residence, that is named after Owain. It used to be a hotel, and is now where students live.

Tromsø (city)

Tromsø (; ) is a city in Troms county, Norway. It is located on the island of Tromsøya, just off the mainland of Northern Norway. The city has an estimated population of 64,492 people and an area of . It is the largest urban area in Northern Norway. 

The University of Tromsø and University Hospital of North Norway are the largest workplaces in the city. The fishing industry is also important, and Tromsø is home to the headquarters of Norges Råfisklag and Norges sjømatråd (seafood council). 

Tromsø is situated in the Arctic region on the island Tromsøya. It is surrounded by mountains. The highest one, called Tromsdalstinden, has an elevation of above sea level.

Tromsø is also surrounded by fjords. The Ullsfjorden is a notable one east from Tromsø. These fjords make it possible to engage in activities such as fishing, boating, and wildlife observation.

The waters around Tromsø are home to different types of sea animals, such as Atlantic cod, herring, seals, and whales. The yearly whale migration can be seen in Tromsø. Humpback whales, orcas, and fin whales can be seen in the fjords during the migration.

Tromsø is also home to many land animals. The mountains and forests are a place to live for reindeer, Arctic foxes, and many types of birds. Seabirds like puffins, kittiwakes, and guillemots can be seen.

Tromsø is warmer than other places at the same latitude, thanks to the warming effect of the Gulf Stream. However, the Gulf Stream is showing signs of uncertainty due to global warming. The city center of Tromsø has the highest number of old wooden houses in Northern Norway, with the oldest house dating back to 1789. The city is a cultural center for the region, with several festivals taking place in the summer.

Tromsø has a long history, with evidence of people living there dating back to at least 10,000 years ago. The area was first settled by the indigenous Sámi, who still live there today. In the 13th century, Norwegians began to settle in the area and Tromsø grew into an important trading post. The city became a centre for fishing and whaling, which were important industries for many years.

Tromsø has also played a significant role in polar exploration. Many expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic regions began in Tromsø, including those of Roald Amundsen and Fridtjof Nansen. During World War II, Tromsø was occupied by the Germans, and there were many battles fought in the area.

Principality of Capua

The Principality of Capua ( or "", ) was a state in the south of the Italian Peninsula. It existed from the 9th century to the 11th century. For most of its history, it was independent in practice, but officially under the suzerainty of the Western and Eastern Roman Empires.

Capua was originally a gastaldate within the Principality of Benevento, and then a county within the Principality of Salerno. The rulers of Capua were Lombards until 1058, when it was conquered by Normans.

Old Capua was an ancient Etruscan city. It was the one of the most important cities in southern Italy during the Roman Empire. When the Lombards invaded Italy in the second half of the 6th century, Capua was sacked. Later, it was made a part of the Duchy of Benevento, and ruled by a Lombard official with the title of "gastald". Little is known of this part of its history.
Capua first became a state of its own under Landulf I. In 839, the duke of Benevento, Sicard, was killed by Radelchis, who took the throne for himself. This caused a civil war that divided the country. Sicard's brother Siconulf declared Salerno independent and himself prince of Salerno. Landulf and his sons had also been allies to Sicard, so the gastald declared Capua independent too. In 841, Capua was sacked and completely destroyed by mercenaries hired by Radelchis. In early 849, Landulf's eldest son Lando I asked the Holy Roman Emperor to settle the dispute and end the war. The emperor divided Benevento and Salerno into two separate principalities. Capua was made a county of the Principality of Salerno. Since Old Capua had been destroyed, Lando I had a new city built around a nearby fort in 856. This new city was the Capua that still exists today.

Lando did not submit to Siconulf or Salerno for very long. Capua was invaded by Salerno and Naples in 859, but defeated them. Pando (ruled 861–862) declared Capua independent of Salerno in 862. On his death in the same year, a dispute arose over who should be the next count. Pando's son Pandenulf was deposed by his uncle Landulf II. Landulf was also the bishop of Capua, so he governed both politics and religion in the county. When he died in 879, a civil war started over the throne. The two claimants were Pandenulf, the previous count who had been deposed, and Lando III, another grandson of Landulf I. Salerno allied with Lando III and Benevento with Pandenulf. They both ruled in different parts of the county, and they both made their sons Bishop of Capua. Pandenulf successfully held the throne in Capua during the civil war, until Lando III captured the city in 882.

Lando III and his brother Landenulf I spent their reigns defending Capua against Naples. Their other brother, Atenulf, had joined with Naples against them. By early January 887, Atenulf established himself as the Prince of Capua. He then turned his attention to conquering Benevento.

In 899, Atenulf I defeated Radelchis II and conquered Benevento. He was proclaimed Prince of Benevento in January 900. He united the principalities of Capua and Benevento and declared them to be inseparable. He also introduced a diarchy-style system for the throne. Under this system, the sons and brothers of the prince would have equal status, and would rule alongside the prince. By doing this, Atenulf hoped to prevent future disputes over succession.

Atenulf made his son, Landulf III, co-prince. Together they made alliances with the local Greek states, such as Naples and Gaeta. After Atenulf died, Landulf mostly continued the policies of his father. He is best known for his involvement at the Battle of Garigliano, in which the Fatimid Saracens were defeated. He spent most of his reign after Garigliano trying to weaken the Byzantine authority in Apulia and the Campania. His son, Landulf IV, allied against Salerno. Like his father, he attacked Byzantine territories, but was defeated. Capua was forced to become a vassal of the Byzantine Empire, at least officially.

Under Landulf IV's sons, the union of Capua and Benevento broke down. Although they remained united by law, Pandulf ruled in Capua and Landulf V ruled in Benevento. However, all of the Lombard states in Italy were eventually unified under Pandulf, who was called "Ironhead". The Emperor Otto I gave the Duchy of Spoleto and Camerino to Pandulf in 967. When Landulf V died in 969, Pandulf seized Benevento from his nephew, Pandulf II. He then became Prince of Salerno in 978, when the reigning prince died without any children. Before Pandulf died, he split the country between his sons; Benevento–Capua was given to his eldest son, Landulf VI.

Soon, Benevento and Capua were divided by the Emperor Otto I. Landulf VI kept Capua, while Benevento was given back to his cousin, Landulf V's son Pandulf II. In the 990s, Capua experienced a period of instability. Landenulf II was murdered by his brother Laidulf, who took the throne for himself. When the Emperor Otto III found out, he had Laidulf removed. His replacement was then overthrown by the citizens of Capua. The old dynasty was reinstalled in 1000 under Landulf VII, the second son of Landulf V. He made his brother, Pandulf II of Benevento, regent for his son and heir. Pandulf reigned alongside his nephew as Pandulf III of Capua. Thus, Capua and Benevento were briefly united for the last time.

Capua regained some of its earlier power under Pandulf IV. He was deposed twice between his succession in 1016 and his death in 1050. He was originally an ally of the Byzantines and remained allied with them against all his neighbours until the end. He was constantly in dispute with the church, and with the coastal duchies of Naples, Gaeta and Amalfi. For all this, he was nicknamed the "Wolf of the Abruzzi". He wanted to give Capua a seaport. He deposed the dukes of Naples and Gaeta, and went to war against Guaimar IV, the Prince of Salerno. The Emperor Henry II had him removed and imprisoned, but he eventually won back his throne.

The city became less important under Pandulf's successors. It was eventually taken by the Norman allies of Guaimar IV.

The Norman count Richard of Aversa conquered Capua in 1058. He left the city itself in the control of Landulf VIII for another four years, until 12 May 1062. Richard became an ally of the Popes, but was later excommunicated. His son and successor, Jordan I, captured an area of Papal territory for the principality. He was also excommunicated. When Richard died, his family was very powerful, with strong influence over central Italy.
When Jordan I died in 1091, the Capua's power declined quickly. From 1091 to 1098, the city of Capua itself was controlled by Lando IV. Lando was a Lombard who was put on the throne by the citizens in opposition to the young Richard II. Richard II was only reinstalled with the help of his fellow Normans from Sicily and Apulia. Capua became dependent on Sicily. The princes continued to try and influence papal elections and act as papal protectors. When Jordan II died in 1127, the principality became a target for Roger II of Sicily, who had united Sicily, Apulia and Calabria. For 20 years from 1135 to 1155, Capua and Sicily were at war with each other until Capua was finally annexed into the Kingdom of Sicily.

Below are listed the rulers of Capua from 840 to 1172.


The gastalds (or counts) of Capua were originally vassals of the Dukes of Benevento. In the early 840s, Gastald Landulf I declared independence from Benevento after Salerno had done the same. That caused a civil war in Benevento, which lasted for more than 10 years. At the end of it, Capua was made a vassal of Salerno by the Holy Roman Emperor Louis II. However, this did not last, and by the end of the 9th century Capua was effectively independent.


In 899, the principalities of Benevento and Capua were united by Atenulf I. Until 982, all of the rulers below were Prince of both Capua and Benevento. Atenulf also developed a new system for the throne where fathers would rule with their sons or brothers.


In 982, the principalities were finally separated by Pandulf Ironhead and the Emperor Otto I.


These princes were of the Drengot line.

Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons

The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is an international organisation made in 1997 in order to watch countries according to Chemical Weapons Convention. The main office of OPCW is in The Hague, Netherlands. On October 11, 2013, OPCW was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.



Actuator

An actuator is a type of motor that either pushes, pulls, or rotates.

Linear actuators are actuators that move in a straight line. They can be made to move by electricity, or by pushing water or air very hard. When water (or oil or another liquid) is used, it is called hydraulic, and when air is used, it is called pneumatic. Hydraulic systems are used for moving very heavy things, like in cranes, excavators, or bulldozers.

First Battle of the Marne

The First Battle of the Marne was a battle in the First World War. It was fought between the German Empire on one side, and

the French and British on the other. The battle ended with a tactical retreat of the German army. It was one of the first signs that the Schlieffen Plan had failed. The battle cost the lives of over one million French and British soldiers. It also cost the lives of over 750,000 soldiers on the German side. The battle was fought from 5 - 12 September 1914. The battle marked the end of the German advance into France. It marked the beginning of trench warfare that World War I became famous for.

The Schlieffen Plan called for an attack through Belgium. The Germans were to avoid the main French fortifications, on the German frontier. They invaded Belgium on August 3rd 1914. The Germans pushed through the Belgium army with little difficulty. After destroying the main fortifications in Liege and Namur, the German First Army and Second Army under the command of Alexander von Kluck and Karl von Bülow, moved toward Paris. At the Battle of Mons the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) halted the German forces temporarily. They inflicted heavy casualties on the Germans. But the French army and the BEF finally retreated towards the River Marne where they waited for the Germans. With no real opposition the Germans moved as quickly as possible and prepared to face the French and British at the Marne River.

The Germans moved to within of Paris. The French government fled the capital for the safety of Bordeaux. The Germans were so close that they could fire their massive railway guns (massive cannons mounted on railroad cars) right into Paris.

During the battle there was not any way to move French troops fast enough to the front. But there was a solution. General Gallieni called for every taxi and driver to report for duty. Paris had about 10,000 taxis but because of the war only had about 7,000 drivers. Gallieni's plan was to move the troops by taxi, which at the time was a very new invention. The taxis moved through the night and day to carry soldiers. The drivers received 0.20 francs (₣) per kilometer. But by September 8, the taxis had only brought about 5,000 soldiers from Paris. In a battle with over a million men, 5,000 could not make a great difference. Also, most of the soldiers that came by taxi were held in reserve.

The German Second Army led by Bülow decided to move south to destroy the French Fifth Army. General Von Kluck did not know about this so he continued to move up and engage the French. With this movement a large gap was created between the two German armies. The British and French counterattacked into the gap and by September 10 the Germans retreated. Paris was saved.

The Germans retreated forty miles from the Marne. Since their plan had failed they did not know what to do. They had not been trained in trench warfare but their only recourse was to dig in and wait for the allies. Eventually the trenches they dug reached 300 miles in length.

Branch Davidians

The Branch Davidians, or simply, The Branch", are a religious group that split in 1955 from the Davidian Seventh-day Adventists.

The Davidians divided from the Adventists around 1930. Most of them had been removed from membership of the Seventh-day Adventist Church because of their beliefs.

The reform movement believed themselves to be living in the last millennium, when the bible prophecies of Christ's second coming. The name "Branch Davidian" is widely known for the Waco Siege of 1993 on their property near Waco, Texas. The 51-day siege, by the ATF, FBI, and Texas National Guard, resulted in the deaths of the Branch Davidians' leader David Koresh, 82 other Branch Davidian men, women, and children, and four ATF agents.

Isotopes of hydrogen

Hydrogen has three main isotopes; protium (H), deuterium (H) and tritium (H). These isotopes form naturally in nature. Protium and deuterium are stable. Tritium is radioactive and has a half-life of about 12 years. Scientists have created four other hydrogen isotopes (H to H), but these isotopes are very unstable and do not exist naturally.

The main isotopes of hydrogen are unique because they are the only isotopes that have a name. These names are still in use today. Deuterium and tritium sometimes get their own symbols, D and T. However, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry does not like these names much, even though they are often used. There are other isotopes that had their own names when scientists studied radioactivity. But, their names are no longer used today.

Protium is the most common isotope of hydrogen. It makes up more than 99.98% of all the hydrogen in the universe. It is named "protium" because it's nucleus only has one proton. Protium has an atomic mass of 1.00782504(7) u. The symbol for protium is H.

The proton of protium has never decayed in an observation, so scientists believe that protium is a stable isotope. New theories of particle physics predict that a proton can decay, but this decay is very slow. The proton is said to have a half-life of 10 years. If proton decay is true, then all other nuclei that are said to be stable are actually only "observationally stable", i.e. they look like they are stable. Recent experiments have shown that if proton decay does occur, it would have a half-life of 6.6 × 10 years.

Deuterium, or H or sometimes D, is another stable isotope of hydrogen. The isotope has one proton and one neutron. It makes up about 0.0026 – 0.0184% of all atoms of hydrogen on Earth. Deuterium is less in hydrogen gas on Earth and is more in sea water (0.015% or 150 ppm). Deuterium is not radioactive, and it will not harm living things. Deuterium can also form water molecules. Water that has deuterium instead of protium is named heavy water.

Tritium (H) is the most stable radioisotope of hydrogen. That is, of all radioactive isotopes of hydrogen, tritium is the least radioactive. It has a proton and 2 neutrons in its nucleus. Tritium decays through beta minus decay and changes to helium3. It has a half-life of 12.32 years.

Tritium is formed naturally by the interaction between the gases in the upper atmosphere and cosmic rays. It is also created during nuclear weapons tests. Tritium and deuterium is used in D-T nuclear fusion in stars to give out a lot of energy.

Crimea

Crimea (Russian: Крым, Ukrainian: Крим) is a peninsula in the Black Sea that separates it from the Sea of Azov. Crimea has a surface of . It is about by . About 2.4 million people live there. On the Crimean peninsula live Russians, Ukrainians, Crimean Tatars, Crimean Karaites, Krymchaks and Xoraxane Roma.

In 2014 Russia took control of the peninsula and annexed it. Most countries still say it is part of Ukraine. In 2018 Russia built the Kerch Bridge to connect it to Russia.

In 2022, the government of Ukraine recognized the Crimean Tatar indigenous people of Ukraine on the territory of the Crimean peninsula.

The Crimean Khanate ruled Crimea from the 15th to the 18th centuries. Late in the 18th century, the Russian Empire won a war against the Ottoman Empire and took control. The Crimean War was fought here in the 19th century. 

Crimea was part of Russia until the Soviet Union gave it to Ukraine in 1954. Ukraine gave it a limited self-rule as an "autonomous —" . The seat of the government is Simferopol, which is also the biggest city. Other major cities are Sevastopol and Kerch.

In March 2014, after a series of protests in Ukraine the month before, Russian troops took control of Crimea. A referendum in Crimea by Russia was held in which over 95% of voters voted to join the Russian Federation. The Crimean Parliament quickly proclaimed independence from Ukraine as a result. The area became the Republic of Crimea, a federal subject of Russia. 

The referendum is not recognized by Ukraine or the international community. They still consider Crimea de jure Ukrainian territory. On March 24, Russia was expelled from the G8 (which became the G7), and on March 27, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 68/262, which states that the referendum was invalid and Crimea still belongs to Ukraine. In later months, the United States, the European Union, and other places started economic sanctions to prevent Russian people and goods from entering those countries. 

Redback spider

The redback spider is a venomous spider that lives in Australia. The female is larger than the male. The female's body is about 1 centimetre long and the male's body is about 3 millimetres long. The adult female spider is usually black and usually has a red stripe on its back. The female likes to live in warm sheltered places and makes a web to catch insects and other small creatures.

The spider's bite can be very painful and dangerous to people, because it can inject a venom through its fangs. An antivenom injection is available, which can help to restore the health of people who have become very ill after being bitten by the spider.

Pow-wow (folk magic)

A pow-wow is a ceremony practiced by the Pennsylvania Dutch. It is used to cure animals of sickness. It is mainly made up of Christian folk religion and early European beliefs.


Vastu shastra

Vastu shastra is known as the "science of buildings". It was used to build Hindu buildings (architecture), mostly Hindu places of worship (temples).

People who believe in Vaastu shastra think that the universe is made of five things:


Alice Liddell

Alice Pleasance Liddell (4 May 1852 – 16 November 1934) was a child friend of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. She inspired his two books "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" (1865) and "Through the Looking-Glass" (1871). Dodgson wrote the two books using the pen name, Lewis Carroll.

Alice was born in Westminster, London, one of ten children of Henry Liddell and his wife Lorina. Her father was Dean of Christ Church college in Oxford. Dodgson was a mathematics don, a Fellow at the college. He was 24 years old when he met Alice on 25 April 1856. He was an expert photographer, and took a number of photographs of her.

Alice and her sisters Edith and Lorina took little trips with Dodgson. They had boating parties and other outdoor adventures. Dodgson told stories on these trips. He started the story of Alice in Wonderland during a boat trip on the Thames on 4 July 1862. In 1864, his trips with the girls were brought to an end by their mother. It is not known why.

Alice grew up a refined young woman. She married Reginald Hargreaves in Westminster Abbey in 1880. The couple lived in a country house in Hampshire. Alice was a very capable person. She managed many servants. She arranged balls and parties. She had three sons. Two were killed in World War I. Her husband never overcame this loss. He died in 1926.

Mrs. Hargreaves sold some of her "Alice" memorabilia through Sotheby's. This sale included the original "Alice" manuscript. It had been the gift of Dodgson. It was bought by an American. It was returned to the United Kingdom during World War II. It now is in the British Museum. Alice died in 1934 in Westerham, Kent. She was cremated and buried in the Hargreaves family plot in Hampshire.

Nazi mysticism

Nazi mysticism is a commonly held belief that Hitler and the Nazi Party practiced the occult. This idea has been part of popular culture since 1959.

There are many documentaries made about this belief.


Anthroposophy

Anthroposophy is a philosophy founded by Rudolf Steiner. The philosophy teaches that through inner development a person can better know the spiritual world.

"Anthropos" is a Greek word that means "human being". "Sophos" means "wise". Steiner believed every human being had the wisdom to understand the mysteries of existence. He left the German Theosophical Society in 1912 trading divine wisdom for human wisdom.

Anthroposophy does not have a rigid set of beliefs. It is said to be a philosophy of freedom. Each person connects to the world through an individual path.

The path to wisdom is based on research. The research leads to knowledge. This is similar to teachings of Thomas Aquinas. Anthroposophy is different in that it pursues knowledge of science, the arts and spirituality all together.

The philosophy also teaches respect of other humans. It encourages support of others in their interest and learning of the spiritual world. To support this, Steiner created The Anthroposophical Society in 1923. It is now called the General Anthroposophical Society. The society has groups and national societies in over 75 countries.


Venom

Venom is a kind of poison used by animals. It is made in an animal's body. It is injected into the body of another animal by a bite or sting. Animals that use venom include some kinds of insects, fish, reptiles, and even mammals.

Some animals use venom to kill another animal that they are going to eat. One animal that does that is the rattlesnake. Some animals use venom to protect themselves. Some animals that do that are bees, ants and stingrays. Some animals use venom for both of these things.

Soliloquy

A soliloquy is a special kind of speech in a play. In a soliloquy, the character speaks to themselves. Other characters of the play are not aware of what is said. That way, the character can share certain thoughts or feelings with the audience. 

There are many famous soliloquies in Shakespeare's plays. Some of those are the "To be or not to be" soliloquy in "Hamlet", the "Is this a dagger" and the "Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow" soliloquies in "Macbeth", and the "Bottom's Dream" soliloquy in "A Midsummer Night's Dream". Plays changed towards realism in the 18th century. Soliloquies became less common in plays. 

Somniloquy

Somniloquy is a sleep disorder. People with the condition often talk during their sleep.

Aurornis

Aurornis is a genus of dinobird from later Jurassic or the Lower Cretaceous. It lived in what is now China. "Aurornis xui" may be the most basal ("primitive") bird species known to date. Aurornis was discovered in 2013. The animal may predate the famous "Archaeopteryx lithographica", the earliest bird, by about 10 million years.

"Aurornis" was described from a sedimentary rock fossil in 2013. The fossil was purchased from a local dealer who said it had been unearthed in Yaoluguo in western Liaoning, China. At first, analysis confirmed it came from the Tiaojishan Formation, which has been dated to the late Jurassic period, about 160 million years ago. The fossil features traces of downy feathers along the animal's tail, chest, and neck. It was only partly prepared at the time of purchase; the feathers were not showing, and the fossil bore no signs of forgery. 

On 7th June 2013 Science (journal) said that Pascal Godefroit, the paleontologist who led the team that described "Aurornis", is uncertain if the fossil material came from Liaoning province's 160-million-year-old Tiaojishan Formation as claimed by the fossil dealer. It may be from the province's 125-million-year-old Yixian Formation, which is known to have produced several ancient bird fossils. The failure to secure rigorous provenance casts doubt on the claim that "Aurornis" is 160 million years old and predates "Archaeopteryx". Godefroit's team will try to confirm the specimen's age by mineralogical and botanical analysis on the shale slab. 

"Aurornis" was roughly the size of a modern pheasant – in length from beak to tail tip. It had claws and a long tail. Its leg bones are similar to those of "Archaeopteryx", but overall its bone structure is more primitive. The absence of larger feathers suggests "A. xui" was unable to fly. If "Aurornis" lived roughly 160 million years ago, this is about ten million years before "Archaeopteryx", which often has been described as the first bird.

A phylogenetic analysis of "Aurornis" published in 2013 found that it belongs in the bird lineage, in a more basal position than "Archaeopteryx". The analysis was based on "almost 1,500 [anatomical] characteristics."

The classification of "A. xui" as a bird is somewhat contentious, however, due to the various differing definitions of the word "bird". Recent discoveries "[emphasize] how grey the dividing line is between birds and [non-avian] dinosaurs", says Paul Barrett of the Natural History Museum, in London. "There's such a gradation in features between them that it's very difficult to tell them apart ... ["Aurornis xui"] is certainly an older member of the bird lineage than "Archaeopteryx", and it's fair to call it a very primitive bird. But what you call a bird comes down to what you call a bird, and a lot of definitions depend on "Archaeopteryx"." Bird evolution specialist Lawrence Witmer called the new analysis compelling, but said it remains difficult to distinguish birds from birdlike dinosaurs: "All of these little feathered species running and flapping around ... were all very similar."

American paleontologist Luis Chiappe said that "A. xui"'s forelimb is too short to be a true bird. It "is very birdlike, but it is not yet a bird," he concluded.

Casting (metalworking)

In metalworking, casting is the act of pouring liquid metal in to a mold. When it hardens it is sometimes called a "cast" or "casting".

Casting processes have been used for thousands of years. It is widely used for making sculptures, jewelry, weapons and tools.

To cast iron, which is the most common material for casting, metal is first melted. It is then poured into a mold and let cool. After cooling, it may be grinded to become smooth, or hammered to become stronger.

Canadair CL-13 Sabre

The Canadair CL-13 Sabre is a jet aircraft built in Canada. It is similar to the F-86 Sabre made by the USA. About 1800 of these planes were built from 1950 under a license from the United States. It was used in Canada and Germany.

Development regions of Nepal

Nepal was divided into 5 Development Regions (), 14 Administrative Zones () and 75 Districts () before 20 September 2015. After 20 September 2015, Nepal is divided into 7 provinces and 77 districts.


Zones of Nepal

Until 2015, Nepal was divided into 14 administrative zones ("anchal") and 77 districts (""). The 14 administrative zones were grouped into five development regions.

In 1962, Nepal reorganized into 14 administrative zones but, around 1995, zones fell into disuse, so the already existing development regions effectively became the primary subdivisions.

The administrative zones, by development regions and from east to west, were the following:


Willie Degel

William Jack "Willie" Degel (born September 1, 1967) is an American entrepreneur who started and is the chief financial officer of the "Uncle Jack's Steakhouse" chain of restaurants in New York City. He is best known as the host of "Restaurant Stakeout" on Food Network. He was born in Queens, New York.

Degel opened his first restaurant, "Hollywood and Main", in June 1990 in Flushing, Queens. Six years later, he opened "Uncle Jack's Steakhouse", which has three locations in New York City. In March 2012, Degel began hosting "Restaurant Stakeout", where he goes to different restaurants around the country with hidden cameras to take a look at problems with the service that the restaurants are having.


Restaurant Stakeout

Restaurant Stakeout is an American reality television program that airs on Food Network. It began on March 12, 2012. It follows New York City restaurant owner Willie Degel, who goes to different restaurants around the country with hidden cameras to take a look at problems with the service that the restaurants are having. The show has actors who go into the restaurants to be rude or difficult to the employees. The second season began on August 29, 2012. It is one of the first "reality" series to air on Food Network.


DVD-Audio

DVD-Audio is an audio format similar to the CD. It is commonly claimed to have higher audio quality than the CD. DVD-Audio has not become popular due to the cost and rarity of the players, and because the traditional CD is considered good enough. Tests have shown that the traditional CD already has the highest possible audio quality. This has been mathematically proven by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. DVD-Audio does, however, support surround sound, and many DVD-Audio releases are available with surround sound. The traditional CD theoretically supports surround sound too, but, with the exception of DTS and Dolby Surround-encoded CDs, no surround-capable CD player has ever been made, and no surround-formatted CD has ever been released.

DVD-audio supports multiple sample rates, including 44.1 (same as CD), 48 (same as DAT and DVD-Video), 88.2, 96, 176.4, and 192 kHz, with either 16, 20, or 24-bit encoding. Surround sound is supported up to the 96 kHz sample rate; higher sample rates can only be in mono or stereo. DVD-Audio also uses 56-bit encryption on the audio data (DVD-Video uses 40-bit CSS encryption and CD does not use encryption). The 56-bit encryption algorithm is a modified version of DES, and like DES it has been broken. DVD-Video content may be present on a DVD-Audio disc to enable compatibility with video-only players. Unlike Super Audio CD, there is no mechanism for compatibility with standard CD players.

Boris Christoff

Boris Christoff (18 May 1914 – 28 June 1993) was a Bulgarian singer. He sang in the bass range. Critics thought him to be one of the great acting singers of the 20th century. He sang some 40 roles. His most famous role was Boris Godunov. He also received kudos for his Philip II in Verdi's "Don Carlo", and for his Mephistopheles in Gounod's "Faust". He sang several Wagnerian roles. These included Hagen in "Gotterdammerung" and King Mark in "Tristan und Isolde".

Christoff was born in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. He sang in the Gusla Choir. King Boris of Bulgaria gave him a private stipend to study in Rome. He studied with Riccardo Stracciari. He also studied in Salzburg, Austria. After World War II, Christoff lived in Rome. In 1950, he was hired to sing the title role in "Boris Godunov" at Covent Garden. This became the role he was known for. He sang in the United States. He never sang at the Metropolitan Opera. Problems with his visa made this impossible.

Italian Peninsula

The Italian Peninsula or Apennine Peninsula (, "Penisola appenninica") is a large peninsula of Southern Europe. It extends into the Mediterranean Sea, with the Ionian and Adriatic Seas on the east and the Tyrrhenian Sea on the west. It is in between two larger peninsulas: the Iberian Peninsula and the Balkan Peninsula. Because of the peninsula's shape, it is nicknamed "Lo Stivale" ("The Boot"). Three smaller peninsulas make it look similar to this shape. They are named Calabria (the "toe"), Salento (the "heel") and Gargano (the "spur").

The peninsula is about long, starting from the Po Valley in the north. The Apennine Mountains cover most of its length. It mainly has the Mediterranean climate, though in the mountainous parts the climate is much cooler.

Since the reign of Roman Emperor Augustus (end of 1st century BC), the northern border of the peninsula has been set on the Alps drainage basin. Geographically, however, its northern end runs from the Magra to the Rubicon rivers, north of the Apennines in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna. This definition does not include the Po Valley or the southern slopes of the Alps.

Nearly all of the peninsula is part of the Italian Republic, apart from San Marino and the Vatican City.


Battle of Reading (871)

The Battle of Reading was fought in 871 at Reading. It was one of a series of battles between invading vikings and the Anglo-Saxons of Wessex. The viking (also called Danish) army was led by Bagsecg and Halfdan Ragnarsson. This was a large combined army. The viking army was attempting to conquer Wessex. The Wessex army was led by king Athelred of Wessex and his brother Alfred. Both the battle and the campaign it was a part of are described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. This account provides the earliest known written record of the existence of the town of Reading. The Vikings had established a camp at Reading. The camp had several natural defenses. It was protected by the Thames and Kennet rivers on two sides, and by a rampart on the western side. Three days after their arrival, a party of Danes rode out towards nearby Englefield. There they met a West Saxon force under the command of Ealdorman Athelwulf. In the Battle of Englefield many of the Danes were killed, and the rest driven back to Reading. Four days later, Athelwulf was joined by the main West Saxon army, led by King Athelred and his brother, Alfred. The entire Saxon force marched on Reading. In the battle that followed the Vikings defeated the Wessex army and it was driven back. Aethelwulf, the ealdorman, was killed in the fighting.


Auditory hallucination

An auditory hallucination is a type of hallucination in which a person thinks they hear sounds, but the sounds are not actually there. In medical terms, it is called a paracusia. A common form involves hearing one or more voices talking. This can be a sign of some psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia or mania. It is very important sign when deciding that a patient has one of these conditions.

People may hear voices without suffering from any specific mental illness. The causes are still being researched. The main cause of auditory hallucinations in psychotic patients is schizophrenia. The underlying problems in these cases may be genetic.

There are three main ways in which the hallucination may form: a person hearing a voice speak thoughts, a person hearing one or more voices arguing, or a person hearing a voice narrating their own actions. There can be other types of auditory hallucinations besides these three. These include hearing music playing inside the mind, usually songs that the person is familiar with. This is usually caused by damage to the brain, hearing loss or epileptic activity.

The main method of treating auditory hallucinations is antipsychotic medications that affect the body's dopamine metabolism. If the hallucinations are being caused by a mood disorder, then other medications (such as antidepressants or mood stabilizers) are often used together with the antipsychotics. These treatments may stop the hallucinations, but they are not a cure as they do not fix the cause of the problem. Some psychological therapies have been shown to help lower the intensity of the hallucinations and how often they occur.



Flat panel display

Flat panel display is the name for a number of devices which are either used as computer screens, as televisions, or to display information; for example at an airport. Most of them use Liquid Crystal display technology; which is newer than cathode ray tubes. 

The most common display technologies are:

HMS Royal Oak

HMS "Royal Oak" was a British battleship. It was built in 1916 and fought in the Battle of Jutland the same year. On 14 October 1939, soon after the start of World War II, it was sunk in Scapa Flow in Orkney, Scotland by the German submarine "U-47". 835 people on the ship died when it sank, including the ship's admiral Sir Henry Blagrove. Many of the dead were boys younger than 16. The sinking affected people from both Germany and Britain: the commander of the German submarine, Günther Prien, was given a medal by Adolf Hitler, and the British quickly built sea walls to stop such a thing happening again.

Every year, Navy divers put a flag on the ship's stern.

Districts of Nepal

The districts of Nepal ( - jillā) are the second level in the administrative subdivision of the country.

There are 77 districts that are grouped in 7 provinces. Within the districts are the municipalities and the rural municipalities.

Sweet Genius

Sweet Genius is a reality-themed television cooking competition series that airs on Food Network. It is hosted by pastry chef Ron Ben-Israel. It started on September 9, 2011. It is similar to "Chopped" in that four confectionery and pastry chefs compete in three rounds on the show: "Frozen", "Baked", and "Chocolate". After each round, one chef is eliminated until one chef is left. The winning chef wins $10,000. In each round, there are two ingredients that the chefs must use along with an inspiration that they must base their dish on. The first ingredient that they must use and the inspiration are shown at the beginning of the round, while the second ingredient is shown in the middle of the round. Sometimes, there will be three ingredients. Each round has a limited amount of time that the chefs must make their dish in. There are 40 minutes for the first round, 50 minutes for the second round, and 60 minutes for the final round. After each round, Ben-Israel tastes and gives his thoughts on each chef's dish, and then eliminates one chef.


Saints Row (series)

Saints Row is a series of video games created by Volition game studios. It features mechanics similar to the "Grand Theft Auto" series. Starting from "Saints Row: The Third", Volition decided to experiment with dark humour and unrealistic gameplay, ranging from impossible air stunts to the inclusion of a dildo bat as a weapon. Afterwards, Volition decided to completely abandon realistic game physics and graphics.

"Saints Row IV" was released in 2013 and modified the gameplay, allowing the player to fly and use superpowers, rendering the use of motor vehicles impractical.

"Saints Row Gat out of Hell" was released in 2015 and was set in Hell with the use of superpowers again.
Pelagia noctiluca

Pelagia noctiluca is a jellyfish. In Latin, "Pelagia" means "of the sea", "nocti" stands for night and "luca" means light thus "Pelagia noctiluca" can be described as a marine organism with the ability to glow in the dark. 

This species is commonly known as the mauve stinger. It occurs in warm and temperate waters of the world's oceans, including the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea and Atlantic Ocean. It is also found in the Pacific Ocean, with sightings in warm waters off Hawaii, southern California and Mexico. 

It is an offshore species, although sometimes it is washed near the coastlines and may be stranded in great numbers on beaches. The color varies. As well as pink or mauve, it is sometimes shades of golden yellow to tan.

In an unprecedented event on November 21, 2007, a swarm of jellyfish wiped out a 100,000-fish salmon farm in Northern Ireland, causing around £1 million worth of damage.

As its name implies "P. noctiluca" has the ability to bioluminesce, or produce light. Light is given off in the form of flashes when the medusa is stimulated by the turbulence of a ship’s motion or by waves. This flashing is short, and gradually fades.

Provenance

Provenance is the history of ownership, or the position of a historical object. It comes from the French "provenir", meaning "to come from".

The term was originally used in relation to works of art. It is now used in a wide range of fields, including archaeology, paleontology, archives, manuscripts, printed books, and science and computing. The main reason to trace the provenance of an object is to get evidence of its original production or discovery. This has a special value to help authenticate objects, to prove what they are. Provenance is essentially a matter of documentation.

In archaeology the term provenience is used in related but a subtly different sense to "provenance". Archaeological researchers use "provenience" to refer to the three-dimensional location or find spot of an artifact or feature within an archaeological site, whereas "provenance" covers an object's complete documented history. Ideally, in modern excavations, the provenience or find spot is recorded (even videoed) with great precision, but in older cases only the general site or approximate area may be known, especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded. An object may have both a provenience (where it was found) and a provenance (where it has been since it was found). In some cases, especially where there is an inscription, the provenance may include a history that predates its burial in the ground, as well as its history after rediscovery.

Eastern Development Region, Nepal

Eastern Development Region () was one of Nepal's five development regions. It was at the eastern end of the country. Its headquarters were at Dhankuta.

The Eastern Development Region had Sikkim and West Bengal (India) to the east, Bihar (India) to the south, the Central Development Region to the west and the Tibet Autonomous Region (People's Republic of China) to the north.

The Eastern Region was the third largest Development Region of Nepal with an area of . It was the second in population with 5,811,555 (21.9% of total) people living there in 2011. Its population density was 204.2 persons/km.

The region had three ecological zones: the high mountains, the hills and the Terai.

The highest mountain in the region, and in the world, is Mount Everest. It is in the Solukhumbu District, Sagarmatha Zone. The lowest point of Nepal, Kechana Kalan is also here, in the Jhapa district. It is near the Mechi river and close to the border with India.

The most important rivers in the Eastern Development Region were the Kosi, tributary of the Ganges river; and the Mechi, tributary of the Mahananda River. Nepal's largest river system (the Kosi) and its highest waterfall (the Hyatrung in the Terhathum district) were found in this region. The Hyatrung waterfall () is high.

The region is rich in biodiversity. There are 28 species of "Rhododendron" (out of the 31 species available in Nepal) in the Tinjure-Milke-Jaljale area.

The major cities of this region were Biratnagar, Dharan, Dhankuta, Itahari, Rajbiraj, Birtamod Urlabari and Damak. Other notable places are Namche Bazaar (the town near the base camp of Mt. Everest), Gaighat, Lahan, Ilam, etc.

The Eastern Development Region had 3 Zones, parallel to each other, with a total of 16 Districts, 893 Village Development Committees (VDCs), 1 Sub-metropolitan city, and 13 Municipalities; the zones and districts were:

Branle

The branle is an old French dance of the 16th century. Though French in origin, it spread to most of western Europe. Spelling varies greatly: "bransle", "brangle", "brawl", "brawle", "brall"(e), "braul"(e), or (Scot.) "brantle".

There are few descriptions of the dance steps. It is a sequence dance performed with partners in lines or circles. In John Marston's "The Malcontent" (1604), act 4, scene 2, the character Guerrino describes the steps of a dance called "Beanchaes brawl" (Bianca's branle): t'is but two singles on the left, two on the right, three doubles forward, a trauerse of six round: do this twice, three singles side, galliard tricke of twentie, curranto pace; a figure of eight, three singles broken downe, come vp, meete two doubles, fall backe, and then honour.

A more detailed and more accessible account is given of the Scots branle by the dance historian Melusine Wood.

The music for the dance was written in duple or triple meter, depedning on the type of branle. The four types are simple, duple, guy, and Burgandian, as described by Thoinot Arbeau in his "Orchesography".

Ice sheet

An ice sheet is a large mass of glacier ice that covers an area of more than . It may also be called a continental glacier. There are two ice sheets in the world at the moment: in Antarctica and Greenland.

Ice sheets are larger than ice shelves or alpine glaciers. Masses of ice covering less than 50,000 km are called ice caps. The ice in an ice cap usually comes from a series of glaciers that drain into it.

The Antarctic ice sheet is the largest single mass of ice on Earth. It covers an area of almost 14 million km and contains 30 million km of ice. Around 90% of the fresh water on the Earth's surface is held in this ice sheet. If all of it were to melt, it would cause sea levels to rise by 58 metres. The ice sheet first formed in the early Oligocene. It retreated and advanced many times until the Pliocene, when it came to occupy almost all of Antarctica.

The Greenland ice sheet covers about 82% of the surface of Greenland. Satellite images from NASA show that it is melting at a rate of about 239 cubic kilometres (57.3 cubic miles) each year. If all of it melted, it would cause sea levels to rise by 7.2 metres. The ice sheet did not develop at all until the late Pliocene, but apparently developed very quickly. This had the unusual effect of allowing fossils of plants that once grew on present-day Greenland to be much better preserved than with the slowly forming Antarctic ice sheet.

John Davis (sealer)

John Davis (born in 1784 in Surrey) was an American ship captain from New Haven, Connecticut. He is thought to have been the first to land on Antarctica. He is one of four explorers who share this claim. In February 1821 he may have landed a boat at Hughes Bay. The Davis Strait which separates Baffin Bay from the Labrador Sea was named by William Baffin in 1916. He probably named it after John Davis. 

On March 20, 1820, Davis left New Haven, Connecticut for a trip to the Pacific Ocean. He had received news of the discovery of the South Shetland Islands while he was anchored at the Falkland Islands. Learning there were large numbers of seals there, he and another ship captain sailed their vessels to Greenwich Island. But it was too late in the season and other were there before them. So Davis took his ship, named "Cecilia", in search of seals further south. Finding many seals at Low Island he continued southwards. He probably came upon Hughes Bay on the Antarctic Peninsula. His ship's log records he found "a large body of land." He sent a boat to shore to look for seals but found none. He also wrote "I think this southern land to be a continent". He also wrote in the log the latitude was 64°01'S (sixty-four degrees, one minute, south). Davis continued his journey back to Greenwich Island arriving there on 10 February, 1821. He wintered at the Falkland Islands and returned to seal hunting the following season. It remains impossible, however, to prove he was the first to reach Antarctica.

Sea

A sea is a large body of salt water. It may be an ocean, or may be a large saltwater lake which like the Caspian Sea, lacks a natural outlet.

Seawater is salty. The open ocean has about solids per litre, a salinity of 35ppt. The Mediterranean Sea is a little higher at 37ppt and the Dead Sea has as much as dissolved solids per litre (300ppt). Although sodium chloride is the main salt present, making up about 85% of the solids in solution, there are also per litre of the chlorides of other metals such as potassium and magnesium and of sulphates, carbonates, bromides and other salts. A kilogram (2.2 lb) of salt can therefore be found in 28 litres or one cubic foot of typical ocean water. Despite differences in the levels of salinity in different seas, the relative composition of the dissolved salts is very stable throughout the world's oceans.

The temperature of the sea depends on the amount of sunlight falling on the surface. In the tropics, with the sun nearly overhead, the temperature of the surface layers can rise to over while near the poles the temperature in balance with the sea ice is about . Cold water is denser than warm water and tends to sink. Cold water is denser than warm water and tends to sink. There is a continuous circulation of water in the oceans. Warm surface currents cool as they move away from the tropics, the water becomes denser and sinks. The cold water moves back towards the equator as a deep sea current, driven by changes in the temperature and density of the water, eventually welling up again towards the surface. Deep sea water has a temperature between and in all parts of the globe.

The amount of oxygen found in seawater depends mostly on the plants growing in it. These are mainly algae, including phytoplankton, but also include some vascular plants such as seagrasses. In daylight the photosynthetic activity of these plants produces oxygen which dissolves in the seawater where it is used by marine animals. At night, photosynthesis stops, and the amount of dissolved oxygen declines. In the deep sea where not enough light penetrates for plants to grow, there is very little dissolved oxygen.

Seawater is a little alkaline and during historic times has had a pH of about 8.2. The pH is expected to reach 7.7 by the year 2100, an increase of 320% in acidity in a century. One important element for the formation of skeletal material in marine animals is calcium but it is easily precipitated out in the form of calcium carbonate as the sea becomes more acid. This is likely to have profound effects on certain planktonic marine organisms because their ability to form shells will be reduced. These include single-celled algae called coccolithophorids and foraminifera. These are important parts of the food chain. Reducing their numbers will have significant results. In tropical areas, corals will be affected by a lack of calcium, with knock-on effects for other reef residents.

Wind blowing over the surface of a body of water forms waves. The friction between air and water caused by a gentle breeze on a pond causes ripples to form. A strong blow over the ocean causes larger waves as the moving air pushes against the raised ridges of water. The waves reach their greatest height when the rate at which they travel nearly matches the speed of the wind. The waves form at right angles to the direction from which the wind blows. In open water, if the wind continues to blow, as happens in the Roaring Forties in the southern hemisphere, long, organized masses of water called swell roll across the ocean.


Würstelstand

The Würstelstand ("sausage stand") is the Austrian type of the take-away. These stands are very common in Vienna. Usually, they sell different kinds of sausages. It is not unusual for the people in Vienna to grab a pair of sausages after a performance at a theatre or opera house. In addition, a Würstelstand traditionally also sells Leberkäse. As a side dish, different chile peppers, gherkins and other pickled vegetables are available.

Jan Steen

Jan Havickszoon Steen (born c. 1626 in Leiden, buried 3 February 1679, also in Leiden) was a Dutch painter. He is mostly known for his genre paintings today. He lived during the Dutch Golden Age period. 

Respiratory failure

Respiratory failure is a medical condition which affects respiration. It means the alveoli in the lung are not getting enough oxygen. Because of this, gas exchange in the blood is reduced. Respiratory failure will lead to a person's death. For this reason, it is a medical emergency. Emergency treatment of respiratory failure is very similar to that of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Respiratory failure has been classified by its cause:
Also, respiratory failure can be classified by the speed at which it happens:

Battle of Vimy Ridge

The Battle of Vimy Ridge was a World War I battle fought in 1917 near Arras in northern France. From the fall of 1914 until 1917 the German army held this eight kilometre-long ridge. From there they could see the Allied for miles in all directions. Several times the Allies tried to take it from the Germans without success. On 9 April, 1917 they attacked again. Four divisions of the Canadian Corps attacked nineteen divisions of the German 6th Army defending the ridge. The Battle was won by the Canadians on Easter Monday, 1917. It was the first time that Canadians had attacked as a national unit. However it cost the Canadians 10,602 casualties.

Far-Western Development Region, Nepal

Far-Western Development Region ( - Sudur Pashchimānchal Bikās Kshetra) was one of Nepal's five development regions. It was at the western end of the country. Its headquarters were at Dipayal Silgadhi.

The Far-Western Development Region had the Mid-Western Development Region to the east, Uttar Pradesh (India) to the south, Uttarakhand (India) to the west and the Tibet Autonomous Region (People's Republic of China) to the north.

It was the smallest Development Region of Nepal with an area of . It had the lowest population, with 2,552,517 people in 2011. Its population density was the second lowest of all the regions, with 130.6 persons/km.

The highest mountain in the region was the Api Peak, with high; it is in the Darchula district. Other high mountain is Saipal, high, in the Bajhang district.

The most important rivers in the Far-Western Development Region were the Seti and the Mahakali ("Sharda" in India) rivers; both rivers are tributaries of the Karnali river.

The main city in the region was Mahendranagar, the eighth largest city of the country, at about from the border of India.

Other cities of this region were Dipayal Silgadhi, Dhangadhi, Baitadi (Khalanga, Baitadi), etc.

The region had 2 zones with a total of 9 districts:



Oarfish

An oarfish is a kind of very long, flat fish. "Oarfish" is another word for fish in the Regalecidae family. There are four species of oarfish in the world. The giant oarfish ("Regalecus glesne") is the longest bony fish alive in the world today. It can grow up to long.

Oarfish live in the pelagic zone. This means that they live in water that is not near the shore and not near the bottom of the ocean. They live in all temperate and tropical oceans. Oarfish are also very rare. They are usually only seen when a dead one washes onto the shore. When oarfish are sick or dying, they swim up near the surface of the water. This behavior means that oarfish are probably the "sea serpents" in legends.

There are two ideas about why these fish are called "oarfish." One idea is that their bodies look like oars because they are very long and flat. The other idea is that some people used to think that oarfish swam by moving their fins like the oars of a row boat. We now know that this "rowing" idea wrong. The family name "Regalecidae" comes from a word in , which means "royal".

Naked Cowboy

Robert John Burck (born December 23, 1970), better known as the Naked Cowboy, is an American street performer who performs in Times Square in New York City. He wears only cowboy boots, a hat, and underwear, playing a guitar over his underwear to look like he is nude. He was born in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Burck began performing in 1997 in Venice Beach, Los Angeles. He became popular when a friend suggested that he dress only in his underwear to earn more money. He is currently best-known for performing in Times Square. Tour guides on passing buses point him out, and he gets a lot of attention from tourists who stop and take pictures with him.

Because of his popularity, Burck has appeared on television shows, in music videos, and other mass media. He tried out for "American Idol" in its first season, but did not move on to the next round. He also tried out for "Australian Idol" and "Star Search", with the same result.

On October 6, 2010, Burck announced that he was running for President of the United States in the 2012 U.S. presidential election, representing the Tea Party movement.


Fable (video game)

Fable is a role-playing game made by Big Blue Box and Lionhead Studios for the Xbox, Windows and Mac OS X. The game was released on September 14, 2004 in North America and an extended version of the game called "Fable: The Lost Chapters", was released for Xbox and Microsoft Windows in September 2005.

Fable was originally called Project Ego in early development and took around four years to create, with a team of around 70 developers working on it. The theme music for Fable was composed by Danny Elfman. The game won over fifty awards and was the Xbox's fastest-selling game at that time.

In the game, the player controls the main character, The Hero of Oakvale. The player can interact with people and can battle foes. To further the game's plot, the player must complete missions known as quests and can also complete side quests.

The player can choose to either be good or evil. Completing good deeds will award the character good points and will produce a positive alignment and committing evil acts will add evil points and produce a negative alignment. The character's appearance will also change if the player makes the character's alignment strong enough. If the character has a strong enough positive alignment, a halo will appear above the character's head and if the character has a strong enough negative alignment, a red haze will rise from around his legs, he will draw flies, and will have glowing red eyes and horns.


Adagio for Strings

Adagio for Strings is a work by Samuel Barber. It is his most well known work. It was made for string orchestra from the second movement of his String Quartet, Op. 11. Barber finished the "Adagio for Strings" in 1936. It was the same year that he wrote the quartet. It was conducted by Leonard Bernstein.

It was performed for the first time in 1938, in a radio broadcast from a New York City studio. It was attended by an invited audience, conducted by Arturo Toscanini. Toscanini also took the piece on tour to Europe and South America. 

Its reviews was generally positive, with Alexander J. Morin writing that "Adagio for Strings" is "full of pathos and cathartic passion" and that it "rarely leaves a dry eye." The music is the setting for Barber's 1967 choral arrangement of "Agnus Dei". "Adagio for Strings" can be heard in many TV shows and movies.

In 2004, listeners of the BBC's "Today" programme voted Adagio for Strings the “saddest classical” work ever.


Paleography

Paleography is the study of ancient handwriting. Using paleography, it is possible to understand communication between people.

Zombie walk

A zombie walk is a trek made by people costumed as zombies. These people may also act as starving zombies. They pretend to be looking for human brains to eat. Some people create characters for themselves such as zombie brides, clowns, or mad scientists.

These walks are community events. They are sometimes held near Halloween. There are day walks and night walks. People of all ages join the walk. Sometimes professional make up artists help walkers prepare their faces. Variants on the walk format include zombie pub crawls and zombie runs. 

A walk might be held to raise money for a community concern such as local hunger. Sometimes walkers bring packaged and canned foods for the local food bank. Zombie Walks are held around the world. They may attract thousands of zombie walkers. 

In October 2013, the annual New Jersey Zombie Walk had the largest crowd of zombies ever at 9,592. This crowd walked along the Asbury Park boardwalk. This Zombie Walk is in the Guiness World Record.

Integron

An integron is a type of transposon, a mobile genetic element. It is a two-part genetic system found in bacteria, and maybe more widely. It is the way antibiotic resistance is passed on so rapidly. It is found in plasmids and chromosomes. Although the first function discovered was antibiotic resistance, other bacterial functions (traits) can be transferred by integrons.

Transposons are the gene "capture and expression elements" which put the small mobile elements known as gene cassettes in place and make them work. Usually,
each cassette has only a single gene and a specific
recombination site. The cassettes carry the DNA coding (= 'a gene') for antibiotic resistance (for example). Typically, the DNA would code for an enzyme which cleaves (cuts) the antibiotic molecule up.

The first part of an integron is a gene which codes for an enzyme which captures cassettes. The second is a site on the genome where the cassettes are inserted, and a promoter which drives expression of cassette-associated genes. "Integron" describes such structures both when no cassettes are present and when there are integrated cassettes. Cassettes can be inserted at the site, they can be cut out, and they can undergo horizontal gene transfer.

William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke

William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke ( 1146 — 14 May 1219), sometimes called William, the Marshal or simply the Marshal amd also William Marshal I and nicknamed the Great or the Fearless was an English knight and a nobleman who served four kings of England during his time as a knight: Henry II, Richard I, John, and Henry III. He was the Regent of England during the childhood of King Henry III from the king's ascending to the throne in 1216 until William's death in 1219. 

During his time, he was one of the most important persons in the monarchy next to the Royal family itself. He was noted for his superior combat skills, his continuing loyalty to his Kings and his great ability in diplomacy. Marshal began his life as a “landless” knight to become the Earl of Pembroke and one of the wealthiest men in the country.

Shortly after his death in 1219 at the age of 73, his oldest son, William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, commissioned a biography of the life of his father. Though biographers often embellish their subjects, many of the events of William's life stated there are clearly recorded elsewhere in historical records. Five of his sons succeded William as the Earl of Pembroke: William, Richard, Gilbert, Walter, and Anselm.

William had a great reputation. He was considered to be one of the greatest and most loyal knights in history. William was very active fighting in battles even in his old age. He successfully defeated the French at the Battle of Lincoln in 1217. William led his army to victory and thus, resulted in winning the First Barons' War for King Henry III and resisting the French invasion.

William Marshal’s father, was John Marshal, called John the Marshal. He was the Lord of Newbury Castle located in County Berkshire in England. When William was a young boy, there was a fierce civil war in England between King Stephen, grandson of William I, also called William the Conqueror and Henry I's daughter, Empress Matilda. When William I died, both Stephen and Matilda believed they were the true successor to the Crown. This period in history was known as the time of The Anarchy because there was much lawlessness and violence in the Kingdom. Many barons and Earls would "change sides" when it benefited them to do so and John Marshal was no exception. At first he pledged his fealty or loyalty to King Stephen but later changed it to Empress Matilda. This act helped to turn the tide in the civil war. 

At an early age, William was sent to William de Tancarville to learn the skills of knighthood. He was knighted in 1166. He then crossed the channel to Normandy and went to serve under his uncle, Patrick, the Earl of Salisbury. He fought in Ponthieu in 1168 when greatly outnumbered, his uncle was killed and William was taken prisoner. Marshal's great skill and bravery was noticed and he was ransomed by Queen Eleanor of England. 

As a young adult, Marshal went to many tournaments. These were contests and mock (imitation) wars where Knights competed for great prizes. Tournaments were an opportunity for a knight to acquire valuable possessions such as money, a horse, armor and weapons. They were dangerous and it was not unusual for a knight to be killed during a tournament.

William had become a very skilled knight and after his ramsom he became part of Henry II’s household, teaching men to fight. He became tutor, guardian, protector and friend to the son of Henry II, known historically as Henry the Young King. When young Henry was crowned, Marshal was assigned to serve him as captain of the guard and chief of the knights. It was Marshal who would knight the young King Henry. Marshal also accompanied young Henry on many tournaments. In 1173 young Henry argued with his father. He wanted to assume the throne of England even though his father was still alive. He left England and took his brother Richard with him to his mother's lands in Aquitaine. In 1174, Henry II and his son made peace. William continued on to win fame in tournaments. The young king became ill and died of a sudden disease at Martel on 11 June 1183.

On his deathbed young Henry ordered Marshal to go on Crusade on his behalf. With Henry II's permission, William went on Crusade for two years and his superior fighting skill was recognized by the Knights Templar. When he returned, Henry II at once took him into high favor, and made him a member of his household. Marshal then fought for Henry II against the French King Louis VII of France and in skirmishs against Henry's other sons now in rebellion.

Richard (called Lionhearted) was Henry II’s second son and he also wanted to be King of England and did not want to wait until his father died. After a skirmish, Marshal came upon Richard and instead of killing him, killed his horse. Shortly thereafter, Henry II became ill and retreated to Chinon where he died in 1189.

Richard did not forget Marshal’s act of bravery and loyalty and when he became King, he took Marshal to fight against the King of France. After a time, Richard decided to go on Crusade and left Marshal in England as the Justiciar of England who acted for the king in his absence and presided over the king's courts during his absence.

Richard I reaffirmed his father's promise to William and gave him the heiress of the Earldom of Pembroke, Striguil and the lands that came with her as was promised to him by Henry II shortly before Henry's death. Marshal at once became one of the richest men in the Kingdom. He acquired property in four countries.

Marshal fought valiantly for Richard against the King of France and was there when the peace treaty was made. In 1199 King Richard was wounded and died of his wounds. At that point there was another dispute about who would next be King of England, Arthur or John.

Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, was another son of Henry II and would have been the next in line to be King but he died on either the 19 or 21 August 1186, at the age of 27. The more common version is that he was trampled to death in a jousting tournament. Geoffrey had a son Arthur I, who became the next Duke of Brittany. Arthur felt that he was also heir to the throne of England. Marshal believed that as a brother to King Richard, and in accordance with Norman custom, John, Geoffrey’s brother, should become the next King. It was resolved in John’s favor and he became the next King of England.

William fought alongside King John and after a time, John made William the Marshal of England.
King John was a man who was disliked by many of his barons and Earls. He knew this and distrusted them. When Marshal went over to protect his lands in Ireland the King made him give one of his sons as hostage to make sure that Marshal was not disloyal to him. King John sometimes took lands away from Marshal and at other times gave them back. There was strife all during the reign of King John but Marshal remained loyal to the King throughout.

King John died on 18 October, 1216. At that time his son, Henry III was too young to rule the kingdom. Marshal was appointed as Regent to Henry III to make decisions on Henry’s behalf until he came of age.

Marshal was quite old by then but managed the affairs of Henry III as Regent and even fought in combat at the Battle of Lincoln. He was approximately 70 years of age. On 14 May 1219 Marshal died at Caversham.

When he knew he was dying he took on the robe of a Knights Templar and after his death he was buried in the Temple Church in London. William Marshal’s effigy can still be seen at the Temple Church, London, with his son next to him.

Affinity

In law, affinity is the kinship relationship that exists between two or more people as a result of somebody's marriage. It is different from consanguinity (blood relationship). Affinity is the relationship which each party to a marriage has to the relatives of the other partner to the marriage. But affinity does not cover the marital relationship of the parties to the marriage themselves. 

Under the law, such relatives by marriage are known as affines. More commonly, they are known as , as affinity is usually signified by adding to a degree of kinship.

In law, affinity may be used to prohibit incestuous sexual relations. It may also be relevant in preventing some couples from marrying. Which relationships are prohibited varys from country to country, and from time to time. In some countries, especially in the past, the prohibited relationships were based on religious laws. In earlier laws, affinity was used in the same degrees as consanguinity in prohibiting marriages.

Though laws vary considerably, affinity does not always cease with the death of one of the marriage partners through whom affinity is traced. It does not always end with the divorce of the marriage partners. In addition to kinship by marriage, "affinity" can sometimes also include kinship by adoption and step relationship.



Consanguinity

Consanguinity ("blood relation", from the Latin "") means being of the same kinship as another person. Consanguinity also means being descended from the same ancestor as another person. The laws of many jurisdictions set up degrees of consanguinity when prohibiting sexual relations and marriage. Rules of Consanguinity are also used to determine heirs of an estate. These are according to laws that govern intestate succession. These vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

Most cultures have prohibited marriages between individuals who are closely related by blood (consanguinity). There were some exceptions. Brothers and sisters, as well as fathers and daughters, often married in ancient Egypt. These were primarily limited to the royal family from the earliest times. Some theories hold that it strengthened a King's claim to the throne. In biblical history, Abraham married his (half-)sister Sarah.

Most early societies had rules or laws that limited consanguineous marriages. So the dangers of inbreeding must have been known to them. 

In ancient Rome, marriage was governed by civil laws. Under Roman civil law couples were forbidden to marry if they were within four degrees of consanguinity. The Germanic peoples also had rules against such marriages but were not as strict. 

In the 5th century, after the Roman empire collapsed, the church took over regulating marriage. At first they did not have a great deal of influence. The Church's power over marriage grew gradually. At first the Church followed Roman civil law. In the ninth century the church raised the number of prohibited degrees to seven. They also changed the method by which they were calculated. The nobility of Europe usually married from within their own social class. Eventually they became too interrelated to marry by the Church's rules. Many found it necessary to defy the Church. In 1215 the Fourth Lateran Council reduced the number of prohibited degrees of consanguinity from seven back to four. The pope had the power to waive the rules for particular couples. Frequently, papal dispensations were given allowing closely related couples to marry. These were almost always reserved for the royalty and nobility. Sometimes the Church used consanguinity to block marriage as in the case of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders. In 1049 Pope Leo IX refused to allow the marriage. He did not give a reason but the two were cousins. They married anyway. Ten years later, in 1059, Pope, Nicholas II finally granted a dispensation for their marriage. Despite restrictions and laws, up to the 20th century consanguineous marriages were not uncommon in Europe.

The degree of consanguinity can be illustrated with a consanguinity table. Each level of lineal consanguinity ("i.e.", generation or meiosis) appears as a row. Individuals with a collaterally consanguineous relationship share the same row. Consanguinity (blood relationship) is different from Affinity (relationship through marriage) but have been prohibited in the same degrees in the past.

Thomas Schelling

Thomas Crombie Schelling (14 April 1921 – 13 December 2016) was an American economist and professor of foreign affairs, national security, nuclear strategy, and arms control.

After 1953, he left government to join the economics faculty at Yale University, and in 1958 he was appointed Professor of Economics at Harvard University. In 1969 he joined the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.

In 1993, Schelling received an award from the National Academy of Sciences. He also received an honorary doctorate from Yale University in 2009 as well as an honorary degree from the University of Manchester.

He was awarded the 2005 Nobel Prize in Economics (shared with Robert Aumann) for "having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis".

Schelling was born on 14 April 1921 in Oakland, California. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, at Harvard University, and at Yale University.

Schelling married Corinne Tigay Saposs in 1947. They had four children. They divorced in 1991. Then, Schelling married Alice M. Coleman in 1991. They had four children.

Schelling died on 13 December 2016 in Bethesda, Maryland from complications following a hip fracture, aged 95.

Schelling's most famous work grew out of the post-war interest in game theory and the Cold War. The book covers an area known as strategic bargaining, about how the United States could deal with the Soviet Union after World War II. It is thought to be one of the hundred books that have been most influential in the West since 1945. Many studies at the RAND Corporation and Herman Kahn's Hudson Institute were along similar lines. All these people knew each other and gave advice and seminars at the Pentagon and other U.S. government departments.

Schelling's theories about war were extended in "Arms and Influence". The blurb states that it "carries forward the analysis so brilliantly begun in his earlier "The Strategy of Conflict"... and makes a significant contribution to the growing literature on modern war and diplomacy".

In 1969 and 1971, Schelling published widely cited articles dealing with what he called "a general theory of tipping". In these papers he showed that a preference that one's neighbors be of the same color, or even a preference for a mixture "up to some limit", could lead to total segregation. This explained the phenomenon of complete local separation of distinct groups. 
Once a cycle of such changes has begun, it may have a self-sustaining momentum.

Schelling has been involved in the global warming debate since chairing a commission for President Jimmy Carter in 1980. He believes climate change poses a serious threat to developing nations, but that the threat to the United States has been exaggerated. Drawing on his experience with the Marshall Plan after World War II, he has argued that addressing global warming is a bargaining problem; if the world is able to reduce emissions, poor countries will receive most of the benefits but rich countries will bear most of the costs.



Viking invasion of Britain

The Viking invasion of Britain in 865 AD is sometimes called 
the Great Heathen Army, or Great Danish Army or the Great Viking Army. Previous invasions were for loot, but this one led to semi-permanent settlement.

A large force of Danish Vikings attacked Anglo-Saxon England. This army appeared in East Anglia in 865. Unlike earlier Vikings who made brief raids on England, the Great army stayed for many years in an attempt to conquer all of England. 

The first recorded Viking attack in England was in 793 at Lindisfarne. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reported " the of heathen men miserably destroyed God's church at Lindesfarne." There were many reasons that Vikings began attacking England. The populations of Norway had been growing between the 7th and 9th centuries. The Vikings were pagans who often had several wives and many sons. These young men filled the ranks of armies and joined ship's crews to go on adventures. The beginning of trade between Europe and England had opened up great trading centers. Vikings were traders but at the same time resorted to piracy when it suited them. This was especially true when they found new lands and people who were not well protected. 

The first raiders from the north who set foot in England were from Norway. They sacked and killed monks at Lindisfarne and at Jarrow the following year. The Norwegian Vikings then established colonies in the Shetland and Orkney Islands. They also settled in Ireland. The Vikings from Norway only came back to England in the 10th century and from their settlements in Ireland. The Swedes, called the Rus, were to later expand eastwards into Russia. In 835 there was a raid at the mouth of the River Thames by Danish Vikings. For the next thirty years these attacks on England continued. In 850 Canterbury and London were attacked by a Danish band led by Rorik. He was defeated and killed the next year by Athelwulf of Wessex. Only twice had a Danish army spent the winter in England: in 850 and 854.

In 865 the Danish Vikings changed their tactics. A large army made up of many smaller bands landed in East Anglia. For over a decade they remained in England destroying entire kingdoms as they went. The Danes spent the winter in East Anglia. The local people bought peace with the Vikings by supplying them with horses. After a year they moved northwards to Northumbria now a mounted army. They captured York and defeated two Northumbrian kings, Aella and Osbert, who joined forces to attack the Danes. Both kings were killed. In 867 they appointed a client-king named Ecgberht over the Northumbrians. In the fall of that year they moved south into Mercia. The Danes made their winter camp at Nottingham. In 868 Burgred, the King of Mercia, asked King Ethelred of Wessex and his brother Alfred for their help against the Danes. The Danes did not fight but allowed the Mercians to pay them for peace. 

The Vikings later withdrew to York. The next year, 871, the great Viking army grew much larger. After twelve months in York, the great army moved south again into East Anglia. Setting up winter quarters at Thetford they defeated King Edmund of East Anglia. Next, in the fall of 870 they moved to Reading. Athelred with his brother Alfred arrived with their army to meet the new threat. In the battle that followed, the Battle of Reading, both sides suffered many casualties. Athelred's army was defeated. Four days later the two armies met again at the Battle of Ashdown. This time the West Saxons won the victory and the Vikings retreated to Reading. Two weeks later Athelred and Alfred led the West Saxons against the Danes at Basing where the Danes won. Two months passed without any fighting between them. The next battle was at a place called Merantun. After a day long battle which the English were winning, the Danes were able to regain their lost ground. Just after mid-April in 871, Athelred died. At this point Wessex was the last remaining kingdom that hadn't been destroyed by the Vikings. Within a month, Alfred, who replaced his brother as king, was defeated at Wilton. There were nine more battles between the West Saxons and the Danes in the next year. Wessex finally paid the Vikings for peace which ended the fighting. Alfred remained on the throne. Of the two known leaders of the Danes, Ivar the Boneless disappeared from the records after 871. His brother Halfdan Ragnarsson was still the leader when the Danes withdrew from Wessex to winter in London the same year.

In 872 the Northumbrians rebelled against the Danes and ejected King Ecgberht. They placed King Ricsige on the throne. Ecgberht took refuge in Mercia. The Danes came north to put down the rebellion, but succeeded only in subduing Deira. Within a few weeks the Danes set up their winter camp at Torksey in Mercia. The Danes had operated as a single army for nine years. But in 874 it divided into two armies. They never reunited.

In 874 Halfdan took his followers north to camp at the mouth of the River Tyne. They raided the Picts and Britons in Strathclyde for the next year. But there was little gain in raiding these poorer areas. The Danes had plundered the wealth of most of England and little was left. Halfdan began settling his men in the area of York. The other army led by Gutheram, Oscytel and Arnuld was still fighting against Wessex at the time. By 876 they had concluded a peace with Wessex. In late 878 Guthrum's band withdrew to Cirencester in Mercia. In 879 they moved to East Anglia. The leader Guthrum, known by his Christian name Aethelstan, reigned as king until his death in 890. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle 'they occupied the land and shared it out.' In 878 a new Danish army was camped at Fulham. But by 879 they had left England for the Low Countries.

The settling of a large part of conquered England by the Danes became known as the Danelaw. It became the part of England where the laws and customs were Danish not English. At this point England became divided into three parts. These were Wessex, English Mercia and the Danelaw. The Danelaw was a mixture of the native populations and the members of the great army who settled there. Many placenames were Danish. Many of the words in the English vocabulary have Danish origins. As late as the 11th century when a came to England he did not feel out of place. The languages was the same and the customs were the same. This was true until the Norman conquest of England in 1066 when French was introduced into England.

Nehemiah Grew

Nehemiah Grew (26 September 164125 March 1712) was an English plant anatomist and physiologist, the "Father of Plant Anatomy".

Grew graduated from Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1661, and ten years later took the degree of M.D. at Leiden University. 

He began work on the anatomy of plants in 1664, and in 1670 his essay, "The Anatomy of Vegetables begun", was communicated to the Royal Society. The following year he was elected a Fellow. In 1672, when the essay was published, he settled in London, and soon acquired an extensive practice as a physician. 

In 1673 he published his "Idea of a Phytological History", which consisted of papers he had communicated to the Royal Society in the preceding year, and in 1677 he succeeded Henry Oldenburg as Secretary of the Royal Society. He edited the "Philosophical Transactions" in 1678-1679, and in 1681 he published by request a descriptive catalogue of the rarities preserved at Gresham College.

In 1682 appeared his great work on the "Anatomy of Plants", which also was largely a collection of previous publications. It was illustrated with eighty-two plates, with an appendix of seven papers mostly of a chemical character. The "Anatomy" is especially notable for its descriptions of plant structure. He described nearly all the key differences of morphology of stem and root, showed that the flowers of the Asteraceae are built of multiple units, and correctly said that stamens are male organs. "Anatomy of Plants" also contains the first known microscopic description of pollen.

Much of Grew's pioneering work with the microscope was done at the same time as that of Marcello Malpighi. The two reportedly borrowed freely from one another. Grew's work on pollen was more extensive than that of Malpighi. It led to the discovery that size and shape is different between species, whereas pollen grains within a species are all alike. This discovery is central to the field of micropaleontology.

Johannes Müller

Johannes Peter Müller (14 July 1801 – 28 April 1858), was a German physiologist, comparative anatomist, ichthyologist, and herpetologist. In 1833 he became Professor of physiology at the University of Berlin.

In the later part of his life he chiefly devoted himself to comparative anatomy. Fishes and marine invertebrates were his favourite subjects. He took 19 trips to the Baltic and North Sea, the Adriatic and the Mediterranean to investigate salt-water life.

He authored a comprehensive work on the anatomy of amphibians, which in his era including reptiles. Also, he described several new species of snakes.

Müller mentored some distinguished physiologists and biologists, including Hermann von Helmholtz, Emil du Bois-Reymond, Theodor Schwann, Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle, Carl Ludwig and Ernst Haeckel. In 1834, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1854.


Sobolev space

The Sobolev space is a function space in mathematics. The space is very useful to look at for partial differential equation.
The spaces may be characterized by smooth functions. It is used by mathematicians. There is a strong relation between Soblev space and Besov space. 

Sobolev spaces are named for the Russian mathematician Sergei Sobolev in the 1930s. His space has many uses, but usually are for understanding the solutions of ordinal differential equations and partial differential equations. According to the applications above, there were questions on how to characterize the space using classical functions. These questions were answered in 1964, by Meyers and Serrin.

Meyers and Serrin's theorem is well known for how to characterize to Sobolev spaces by collection of functions can classical derivative up to given oder same as order of distributional derivative of the Sobolev space. In this section, we shall first recall that definition of Sobolev spaces and set to several preliminaries as follows.

Here, Ω is an open set in ℝ"" and 1 ≤ "p" ≤ +∞. The natural number "m" is called the order of the Sobolev space "W"(Ω).

1556 Shaanxi earthquake

The 1556 Shaanxi earthquake was a very bad earthquake that occurred on the morning of 23 January 1556 in Shaanxi, during the Ming Dynasty. It killed around 830,000 people, making it the worst earthquake in human history by number of deaths. 

More than 97 counties in the provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Gansu, Hebei, Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu and Anhui were affected. The earthquake destroyed a area. In some counties, 60% of the population was killed. It had a magnitude of around 8.0.

At the time, many people in that area lived in homes they made from artificial caves. Loess, the material that made these caves, is known to be very weak and can cause landslides. Scholars believe that is why so many people had died.


Naturopathy

Naturopathy is a form of alternative medicine. It is based on the belief that a special energy called "vital energy" guides bodily functions such as metabolism, reproduction and growth. Naturopaths use various froms of treament, such as herbal medicine and massaging with a holistic view. They generally avoid the use of surgery and synthetic drugs. In Naturopathy, evidence-based medicine is thought of as being only part of the evidence. Taken as a whole, naturopathy is an ideologic system, not a scientific one. 

The term "naturopathy" comes from Greek and Latin, meaning "natural therapy". Modern naturopathy developed from the Natural Cure movement in Europe.



Oscar Yanes

Oscar Armando Yanes González (25 April 1927 – 21 October 2013) was a Venezuelan journalist and bestselling author. Yanes is considered to be a pioneer in Venezuela's broadcast journalism department.

He was awarded three times with the National Prize for Journalism. In 1992, he won the Silver Book Prize, awarded by Planeta Publishing, for the largest book circulation of the year.

Yanes was born on 25 April 1927 in Caracas, Venezuela. As a child, he attended the Zamora School, in San Juan Parish. The idol of the parish was the boxer Armando Best. Pompeyo Márquez and Eloy Torres also studied at that school. Both were boxers who were going to end up as communist leaders.

Later, Yanes went to the University and studied as a journalist after he had seen a notice from the newspaper. He entered the first school of journalism that existed in Venezuela, at the Free University "Augusteo", which had been founded in October 1941 by Monsignor Rafael Lovera under General Isaiah Medina Angarita. Press freedom was given by Angarita and allowed the circulation of three newspapers that made history: Últimas Noticias, El Nacional and El Morrocoy Blue. Yanes signed up for the founding squad of Últimas Noticias and stayed there for a few years.[1]

At age 25, he assumed the direction of the newspaper La Esfera. Ramón David León, who gave him the chance at 13 of getting to know the world of journalism, gave him his office and his position 12 years later, when he decided to sell the newspaper to Miguel Ángel Capriles.

Leading the team of Venevisión, a Venezuelan network, Yanes was sent in 1966 to Vietnam as a war correspondent and press officer. For two months, he made six reports that were distributed throughout Latin America: "The War on the Sea" (la guerra en el mar), "The War in the Air" (la guerra en el aire), "The War in the Jungle" (la guerra en la selva), "The Vietcong, "The Religion "(la religion) and "The Vietnamese Woman" (la mujer vietnamita).

He stood out as professor of the first class of the School of Social Communication of the Central University of Venezuela (Universidad Central de Venezuela) and taught a class in the Andrés Bello Catholic University (Universidad Catolica Andres Bello) of Caracas.[2]

He won on three occasions the National Prize for Journalism, the Monseñor Pellín Prize and the First Prize of the Association of Writers of Venezuela in the contest of biographies of famous Venezuelans, for his work "Carlos J. Bello, the Forgotten Sage." He also won the Silver Book Award in 1992, which is awarded by Editorial Planeta for the book with the highest circulation of the year.

Divine right of kings

The divine right of kings, was a political and religious doctrine. It meant that a monarch was given the right to rule by God alone. His authority could not be questioned because he ruled in God's name. It gave a king absolute rule over his subjects.

Pharaohs and some other ancient Kings were thought to actually be gods or descendants of gods. That concept went away when monotheism spread. A medieval principle held that God gave the right in to rule in secular matters to political rulers. God gave the right to rule over spiritual matters to the Pope as head of the Church. This has been called the 'doctrine of the two swords'. In 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as the Holy Roman Emperor. From that time on the Emperor was the secular power while the Pope was the power. This concept began to break down prior to the First Crusade. Rather than have the Emperor provide the manpower for the crusade, the Pope called on the nobility of Europe directly.

In England, Henry VIII broke free of the Catholic church and the authority of the Pope. By the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 Henry was both king and "Supreme Head" of the Church of England. Following the Protestant Reformation the theory of divine right gave the king absolute authority as God's representative on earth in both political and spiritual matters. It made him accountable to no one but God. James I of England in his speech to Parliament in 1609 said:
In France the theory had been considered from the 13th century. Although France remained Catholic, her kings gradually pulled away from papal rule. By the 16th century the king replaced the pope as supreme authority over the French church. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688–89 the divine rights theory was no longer popular in England. In France, kings including Louis XIV of France (1643–1715) continued the divine rights doctrine. That was until the French revolution in 1789. By the 19th century it no longer had any .

The Chinese culture had a similar but older concept called the 'Mandate of Heaven'. A good ruler had the blessings of heaven. But one who ruled badly would cause the mandate to be removed. When the People's Republic of China was formed in 1949, they claimed the Mandate of Heaven from the people.

Jan Purkyně

Jan Evangelista Purkyně (17 December 1787 – 28 July 1869) was a Czech anatomist and physiologist. He was one of the best known scientists of his time. In 1839, he coined the term 'protoplasm' for the fluid substance of a cell.

Purkyně was born in Bohemia, which was then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now it is in the Czech Republic. In 1818, he graduated with a degree in medicine, and was appointed Professor of Physiology. He published two volumes which contributed to experimental psychology. He created the world's first Department of Physiology at the University of Breslau in Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland), and the world's first official physiology laboratory.

He is best known for his discoveries of Purkinje cells and Purkinje fibres. Purkinje cells are large neurons with many branching dendrites found in the cerebellum. Purkinje fibres conduct electrical impulses to all parts of the ventricle of the heart. Other discoveries include Purkinje images, reflections of objects from structures of the eye, and the Purkinje shift, the change in the brightness of red and blue colours as light intensity decreases gradually at dusk. Purkyně also introduced the scientific terms plasma (for the component of blood left when the suspended cells have been removed) and protoplasm (the substance found inside cells.)

Purkyně was the first to use a microtome to make wafer thin slices of tissue for microscopic examination and was among the first to use an improved version of the compound microscope. He described the effects of camphor, opium, belladonna and turpentine on humans in 1829. He also experimented with nutmeg that same year, when he "washed down three ground nutmegs with a glass of wine and experienced headaches, nausea, euphoria, and hallucinations that lasted several days", which remain a good description of today's average nutmeg binge. Purkyně discovered sweat glands in 1833 and published a thesis that recognised nine principal configuration groups of fingerprints in 1823.

Purkyně was, in the opinion of Henry Harris, the true father of the cell theory. The work of Purkyně and his student and collaborator Gabriel Valentin (1810–1883) was "unjustly denigrated by the nationalistic Germans. They have a claim to some priority in the cell theory". 

Johannes Müller (1801–1858) also made great contributions. However, it was Theodor Schwann and Matthias Schleiden (1804–1881) who got the credit for the cell theory, despite the fact that some of their observations were not correct, and their credits to previous workers were "a travesty".

Roger I de Montgomery

Roger I de Montgomery, was the (lord) of Montgomery and vicomte of the Hiesmois in Normandy.

Roger was the son of Hugh de Montgomery and his wife Josceline. She was the niece of Gunnora, Duchess of Normandy. Roger held the lands of Saint-Germain-de-Montgommery and Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery. Both had traces of early castles. He became the Viscount of the Heismois about the same time Robert I of Normandy became Duke in 1027. But as the viscount he witnessed a royal charter to the abbey of St. Wandrille . Like Duke Robert, Roger began taking properties that belonged to the church. These included () half the town of Bernay. He took over a woodland at 'Crispus Fagidus' which belonged to Jumièges Abbey. He put an end to a market held by the same abbey and took it into his own domain. Later he seemed to have a change of heart. He returned the market to the abbey and paid restitution for their losses.

After 1035 Roger seems to have lost favor with the young duke William. He signed an early charter of Duke William simply as 'Roger of Montgomery'. He apparently was no longer the viscount. In 1037 when rebellions broke out, Roger was one of the rebels. When he was defeated he fled to the court of Henry I of France. Roger was forced into exile by Osbern the Steward. Osbern was later killed by William de Montgomery, Roger's son. Where and when Roger died is unknown. In 1068 his wife was still holding lands at Bures and Saint-Pair.

The name of Roger's wife is unknown but he had five sons:

Paradox of thrift

The paradox of thrift is the idea that during a recession, people will want to save more money. But if everyone saves money, then the economy can slow down even more, reducing peoples' income as a result. It is often linked with John Maynard Keynes. It is a main theory of Keynesian economics.

It is a kind of prisoner's dilemma: saving benefits each individual but damages the general population. This is a paradox because it is contrary to intuition. Someone might think that what seems to be good for an individual in the economy will be good for the entire population. However, exercising thrift may be good for an individual by enabling that individual to save for a "rainy day", and yet not be good for the economy as a whole.

There is little agreement as to how important this is in a modern economy. Modern economies are huge, and much affected by other national economies. 

Mora (ship)

The Mora was William the Conqueror's flagship for his invasion of England in 1066. It served as his personal ship between England and Normandy afterwards. It was the largest and fastest ship in his invasion fleet. The Mora was a gift to William by his wife Matilda of Flanders.

The "Mora" was built at Barfleur in Normandy. It was a gift from Matilda of Flanders to her husband Duke William of Normandy. It was completed in the summer of 1066. Mora was a larger ship that could carry ten to twelve knights with their , weapons and . It would also have a crew to sail it. The captain of the ship was Stephen, the son of Airard. Stephen was the captain of the Mora for over twenty years. Orderic Vitalis described the ship: "it had for its the image of a child, gilt, pointing with its right hand towards England, and having in its mouth a trumpet of ivory. "Mora" carried sails and at the top of the was the papal banner (Pope's flag), consecrated and sent to William from Rome. The banner was described as "a square white banner charged with a gold cross within a blue border."

Before sunset on September 27th, according to William of Poitiers, Duke William's invasion fleet left for England. The Mora led the fleet. Mora carried a lantern on her mast so she could be seen in the dark. A horn also let the other ships know where the Mora was. The Mora was much faster than the other ships. By dawn William found himself in mid-channel, alone, with no other ships in sight. While he waited his servants served him breakfast with wine. Once the others were in sight the fleet proceeded to Pevensey in Sussex. According to Elisabeth van Houts, the meaning of the name is not known although there have been several suggestions. It might be named for the "Morini", ancient inhabitants of Flanders. This is where Matilda was from. The Latin word "mora" has several meanings, none of which seem likely. These range from 'delay' or 'pause' to 'foolish' or 'foolish woman'. Also is the possibility that "Mora" was an anagram of "Amor".

Bluefish

The bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) is a kind of fish which occurs in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific. It is a pelagic fish, which means that it lives near the surface of the ocean. They can grow to a size of and reach a weight of . In the wild, they live to be about nine years old. 

Bluefish are predators: they hunt other fish, in small groups. Bluefish are caught commercially, and there is a problem with overfishing. 

Sometimes another species, Rock salmon or Coal fish is erroneously called Bluefish.

It is the only species in the family Pomatomidae, in the genus Pomatomus.

One extinct relative of the bluefish is "Lophar miocaenus", from the Late Miocene of Southern California.

Economic liberalization

Economic liberalization is a theory about applying the ideas of classical liberalism to the government of a state: In very broad terms, it is about removing as much state control as possible from the economy.

Barcode reader

A barcode reader or barcode scanner is an electronic input device which is able to scan and decode barcodes. These devices use optical technology such as infrared light. Some readers use an integrated decoder, others have one unit for reading the barcode, and another one to decode the barcode. A barcode reader also called a price scanner or point-of-sale ( POS ) scanner, is a hand-held or stationary input device used to capture and read the information contained in a bar code. A barcode reader consists of a scanner, a decoder (either built-in or external), and a cable used to connect the reader with a computer. Because a barcode reader merely captures and translates the barcode into numbers and/or letters, the data must be sent to a computer so that a software application can make sense of the data. Barcode scanners can be connected to a computer through a serial port, keyboard port, or an interface device called a wedge. A barcode reader works by directing a beam of light across the bar code and measuring the amount of light that is reflected back. The dark bars on a barcode reflect less light than the white spaces between them. The barcode scanner then converts the reflected light energy into electrical energy, which is converted into data by the decoder and forwarded to a computer.

There are five basic barcode readers -- pen wands, slot scanners, Charge-Couple Device ( CCD ) scanners, image scanners, and laser scanners. A pen wand is the simplest barcode reader. It contains no moving parts and is known for its durability and low cost. A pen wand can present a challenge to the user, however, because it has to remain in direct contact with the bar code, must be held at a certain angle, and has to be moved over the bar code at a certain speed. A slot scanner remains stationary and the item with the bar code on it is pulled by hand through the slot. Slot scanners are typically used to scan bar codes on identification cards. A CCD scanner has a better read range than the pen wand and is often used in retail sales. Typically, a CCD scanner has a "gun" type interface and has to be held no more than one inch from the bar code. Each time the bar code is scanned, several readings are taken to reduce the possibility of errors. A disadvantage of the CCD scanner is that it cannot read a bar code that is wider than its input face. An image scanner, also called a camera reader, uses a small video camera to capture an image of the bar code and then uses sophisticated digital image processing techniques to decode the bar code. It can read a bar code from about 3 to 9 inches away and generally costs less than a laser scanner. A laser scanner, either hand-held or stationary, does not have to be close to the bar code in order to do its job. It uses a system of mirrors and lenses to allow the scanner to read the bar code regardless of orientation, and can easily read a bar code up to 24 inches away. To reduce errors, laser scanning may perform up to 500 scans per second. Specialized long-range laser scanners are capable of reading a bar code up to 30 feet away.

Players can choose to use a car, a hovercraft, or a plane, although some tracks make the player use one of those. Each track has boosters that make the player go faster, and balloons that give the player an item that they can use during the race. Players can choose from 10 characters. Two of the game's characters, Conker and Banjo, would later star in their own games. Conker went on to star in "Conker's Bad Fur Day", while Banjo went on to star in "Banjo-Kazooie".

A remake for the Nintendo DS called "Diddy Kong Racing DS" was released on February 5, 2007 in North America and on April 20, 2007 in Europe. It has better graphics and use of the console's touch screen. Banjo and Conker do not appear in it.

Marcello Malpighi

Marcello Malpighi (10 March 1628 – 29 November 1694) was an Italian doctor, who gave his name to several physiological features, like the Malpighian tubule system.

Although the microscope was invented early in the 17th century, it was not much used until Robert Hooke improved the instrument. Then Marcello Malpighi, Hooke, Nehemiah Grew and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek had a virtually untried tool in their hands as they began their investigations. 

Working on frogs and extrapolating to humans, Malpighi demonstrated the structure of the lungs, previously thought to be a homogeneous mass of flesh, and he offered an explanation for how air and blood mixed in the lungs. Malpighi also used the microscope for his studies of the skin, kidneys, and liver. For example, after he dissected the body of a black man, Malpighi made some groundbreaking headway into the origin of black skin. He found that the black pigment was associated with a layer of mucus just beneath the skin.

He was the first to see capillaries in animals, and he discovered the link between arteries and veins. He may have been the first person to see this under a microscope. The microscope let Malpighi discover that the silk worm does not use lungs to breathe, but small holes in their skin called spiracles. This turned out to be true of all insects. 

Because Malpighi had a wide knowledge of both plants and animals, and he made contributions to the study of both. The Royal Society in London published two volumes of his botanical and zoological works in 1675 and 1679. Another edition followed in 1687, and a supplementary volume in 1697. In his autobiography, Malpighi speaks of his "Anatome Plantarum", decorated with the engravings of Robert White (1645–1703) as "the most elegant format in the whole literate world".

Birinus

Birinus ( 650), also St. Birinus was a missionary to Wessex and the first Bishop of Dorchester. His is celebrated on December 3rd. 

Birinus may have been a Lombard by birth. He was sent by Pope Honorius I to help convert pagans in Anglo-Saxon England. The pope first sent him to Genoa. There 
Archbishop Asterius of Milan consecrated Birinus as a bishop. Birinus arrived in southern Britain . He had planned to go to the midlands of England to preach there. But when he found the Gewisse in Wessex were completely pagan, he decided to stay with them. He began to convert the Gewisse (West Saxons) to Christianity. In 635 King Cynegils of Wessex was baptized by Birinus and King Oswald of Northumbria agreed to be his Godfather. This may have been a condition of the marriage between Oswald and Cynegils's daughter, Cyneburh. He gave Bishop Birinus the city of Dorchester and several churches so he could convert the pagans in Wessex. 
In Birinus founded a church at Winchester which later became Winchester Cathedral. Birinus died in 650. He was buried at Dorchester. 

After 660 there were no more West Saxon Bishops at Dorchester. Along with part of Berkshire it was taken over by Mercia. The new see for Wessex was now at Winchester. Some time around 690–700 Bishop Hedda of Winchester had the relics (bones) of St. Birinus moved from Dorchester to Winchester. Up to this time Bishop Birinus had been considered a minor saint. In 1223 monks of Dorchester abbey located the tomb of a former Bishop. The body was dressed in the garments and tunic of a bishop so they believed it was St. Birinus. At the time of the discovery miracles were claimed. One claim was that a dumb child could suddenly speak English and French. The monks sent their findings to Rome. The pope wrote to Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury asking him to manage the translation. But a problem caused the ceremony to be delayed. Archbishop Langton discovered the body had already been moved to Winchester . Both Dorchester and Winchester claimed to have the relics of Bishop Birinus. For that reason two feast days were observed for him, December 3rd and 4th. The Catholic Church recognizes December 3rd. A shrine was created for him in the 14th century. It was later destroyed, but it has been rebuilt since.

Jan Swammerdam

Jan Swammerdam (12 February 1637 – 17 February 1680) was a Dutch biologist and microscopist. His work on insects showed that the stages an insect life – egg, larva, pupa, and adult – are different forms of the same animal. He did experiments on muscle contraction. In 1658, he was the first to observe and describe red blood cells. He was one of the first people to use the microscope in dissections, and his techniques remained useful for hundreds of years.

Knowledge of insects in the 17th century was to a great extent inherited from Aristotle. Swammerdam dissected insects and studied them under microscopes.

Swammerdam showed that insects develop in the same gradual manner as do other animals. He wanted to dispel the seventeenth-century idea that different life stages of an insect (e.g. caterpillar and butterfly) were different individuals. 

He got evidence from his dissections. By examining larvae, he identified adult features in pre-adult animals. For example, he noticed that the wings of dragonflies and mayflies exist before their final molt. Swammerdam used these observations in his 1669 publication, "Historia Insectorum Generalis" (The Natural History of Insects). This work included many descriptions of insect anatomy. It was here that Swammerdam revealed that the "king" bee has ovaries. "Biblia natura" published posthumously in 1737, carried the first confirmation that the queen bee is the sole mother of the colony. Despite five intense years of beekeeping, the mode of honey bee reproduction escaped him as he wrote, "I do not believe the male bees actually copulate with the females."

Ms. Pac-Man

Ms. Pac-Man is an arcade video game made by Midway Manufacturing (now Midway Games). It was released one year after "Pac-Man", on January 13, 1982. It became one of the most popular video games of all-time after its release. This led Namco to make the game an official title in the "Pac-Man" series. It has a female character, new mazes, and changes in gameplay from "Pac-Man". It is most successful American-made arcade game, selling 115,000 arcade cabinets.

"Ms. Pac-Man" plays similarly to "Pac-Man". The player has to move Ms. Pac-Man, a yellow disc, around a maze. The goal is to eat all of the yellow pellets (circles) while not getting caught by the ghosts. The player can get more points by eating fruits that appear. When Ms. Pac-Man eats a white pellet, the ghosts turn blue. The player can eat them for points. The game has 256 stages. Like "Pac-Man", the 256th level cannot be finished because of a problem with the creation of the game.

The game has gameplay changes from the original "Pac-Man". They include:

John Rosbrugh

Rev. John Rosbrugh (c. 1714–1777) (also spelled Rosborough and Rosburgh) was a graduate of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). He was ordained a Presbyterian minister. In 1776 he organized and commanded the 3rd Northampton County, Pennsylvania . He then then accepted a commission as company chaplain. He was killed at the Battle of the Assunpink Creek, also known as the Second Battle of Trenton. Rosbrugh was the first U.S. chaplain ever killed in battle.

John Rosbrugh was born in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. He to the United States along with his older brother, William. The family was originally from Craigie, County Ayrshire, Scotland. His ancestors went to Ireland during the settling of the Ulster Plantation. In 1733 his young wife Sarah died in childbirth along with their only child. He was a tradesman but well enough educated to prepare himself for college.

He attended the College of New Jersey where he graduated in 1761. He was licensed to preach in August of 1763. In October 1764 he was sent to the congregations of Greenwich, Oxford, and Mansfield Woodhouse, all in western New Jersey. In December 1764 he became a Presbyterian minister. By 1765, he was asked to serve neighboring congregations in Upper and Lower Hardwick in Warren County, New Jersey. In 1766, Rev. Rosbrugh married Jane Ralston. She was the daughter of James Ralston of East Allen Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania. It was then called 'the Irish Settlement.' In 1769 Rev. Rosbrugh was called to serve at the church at Allen Township. This was the same congregation his wife was from. He became their permanent minister. For seven years, he led his congregation in Allen township.

At the start of the American Revolutionary War, news was often read to congregations in their churches. It was one of the main forms of communication at the time. On December 10, 1776, General George Washington called out the militia of Pennsylvania. He wrote to the colonels of the militias of Northampton and Bucks counties asking them and their men to join him as quickly as possible. Rev. Rosebrugh read General Washington's letter to his congregation. The men of the congregation formed a company of militia and agreed to go to war "if" Rev. Rosbrugh would lead them. He had expected to accompany them as their chaplain but reluctantly agreed to lead them. John Rosbrugh took his place at the head of the company and slinging his musket over his shoulder led the company to join General Washington and the Continental Army in Philadelphia.

While in Philadelphia, Rev. Rosbrugh was given a commission as a Chaplain. Captain John Hays took his place as company commander. A chaplain at that time held the rank of major and pay of thirty-three and a half dollars per month. Presbyterian ministers, however, were particularly hated by the British and if captured suffered cruel treatment. Rev. Rosbrugh’s company joined the rest of the Northampton county militia in camp. Rosbrugh also met with his brother-in-law, John Ralston, a member of the Second Continental Congress. The 3rd Battalion was under the command of General Israel Putnam. He had orders to cross the Delaware on the 25th of December in support of Washington’s surprise attack on Trenton. However General Putnam decided not to cross due to weather conditions. So Rev. Rosbrugh’s battalion remained in Philadelphia. After General Washington crossed back to Pennsylvania he decided to take Trenton a second time. This time the 3rd Northampton militia was included. The battle was called the second battle of Trenton or the battle of Assinpink creek.

On the afternoon of January 2nd the Americans were preparing their positions for the upcoming battle. Rev. John Rosbrugh was dining at a public house when a warning was shouted that Hessians were coming. Going outside he found his horse had been taken. He tried to get back to the American lines which were on the other side of Assunpink Creek. But he was suddenly confronted by a company of Hessians under the command of a British officer. He surrendered but they recognized him as a Presbyterian minister. The Hessians him to death. They took his watch and money then left his body naked in the snow. Captain Hays, the company commander, recovered the body and quickly buried him where he fell. The next morning Rev. George Duffield, a brother Presbyterian chaplain moved Rev. Rosbrugh's body to the nearby graveyard of the First Presbyterian Church of Trenton. It is believed he still rests there today. His widow, Jane (née Ralston) survived him by 32 years. She was buried in the East Allen Township cemetery, the inscription on her tombstone indicating her husband John is buried beside her.

About 1766, John Rosbrugh married secondly, Jane Ralston (1739–1809). She was the daughter of James Ralston of the Irish Settlement or Allen Township, PA. John and Jane had five children:<br>



Grand Coulee Dam

The Grand Coulee Dam is a dam on the Columbia River in the United States state of Washington. The dam forms Lake Franklin D. Roosevelt. The dam was built between 1933 and 1942, with a new power plant added between 1997 and 1974. The dam is operated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.

Grand Coulee Dam is high and long. The lake behind it can hold more than of water.

The dam provides water for agriculture in Central Washington. Water is pumped from Lake Roosevelt to Banks Lake, located in the Grand Coulee. From there it runs by gravity to irrigate about of fertile farmland. Incorporated in the late 1940s and early 1950s, this scheme is known as the Columbia Basin Project.

Grand Coulee also produces hydroelectricity. In fact, it is the largest electric-power producing facility in the United States. At full load the dam can produce 6,809 megawatts or enough for 5 million typical American households. The dam was an important source of power for factories during World War II. Today, it provides much of the cheap electric power for the Pacific Northwest.

Among other benefits include flood control for the lower Columbia River and recreational boating and fishing on Lake Roosevelt.

As a consequence of the dam's construction, the reservoir flooded large tracts of Native American lands. Salmon can no longer migrate to the upper Columbia River system.

Relative atomic mass

A relative atomic mass (also called atomic weight; symbol: "A") is a measure of how heavy atoms are. It is the ratio of the average mass per atom of an element from a given sample to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom. In other words, a relative atomic mass tells you the number of times an average atom of an element from a given sample is heavier than one-twelfth of an atom of carbon-12. The word "relative" in relative atomic mass refers to this scaling relative to carbon-12. Relative atomic mass values are ratios; relative atomic mass is a dimensionless quantity. Relative atomic mass is the same as "atomic weight", which is the older term.

The number of protons an atom has determines what element it is. However, most elements in nature consist of atoms with different numbers of neutrons. An atom of an element with a certain number of neutrons is called an isotope. For example, the element thallium has two common isotopes: thallium-203 and thallium-205. Both isotopes of thallium have 81 protons, but thallium-205 has 124 neutrons, 2 more than thallium-203, which has 122. Each isotope has its own mass, called its isotopic mass. A relative isotopic mass is the mass of an isotope relative to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom. The relative isotopic mass of an isotope is roughly the same as its mass number, which is the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Like relative atomic mass values, relative isotopic mass values are ratios with no units.

We can find the relative atomic mass of a sample of an element by working out the abundance-weighted mean of the relative isotopic masses. For example, if a sample of thallium is made up of 30% thallium-203 and 70% thallium-205,

Two samples of an element that consists of more than one isotope, collected from two widely spaced sources on Earth, are expected to have slightly different relative atomic masses. This is because the proportions of each isotope are slightly different at different locations.

A standard atomic weight is the mean value of relative atomic masses of a number of normal samples of the element. Standard atomic weight values are published at regular intervals by the Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). The standard atomic weight for each element is on the periodic table.

Often, the term relative atomic mass is used to mean standard atomic weight. This is not quite correct, because relative atomic mass is a less specific term that refers to individual samples. Individual samples of an element could have a relative atomic mass different to the standard atomic weight for the element. For example, a sample from another planet could have a relative atomic mass very different to the standard Earth-based value.

Relative atomic mass is not the same as:

Rodrigo López

Roderigo López (1525 – June 7, 1594) was a physician of Portuguese background. He was tried and executed for trying to poison Elizabeth I. He is believed to be the inspiration for Shakespeare's character Shylock in "The Merchant of Venice".

López was born into a family of Jewish origin in Portugal. He graduated from university with a degree in medicine. He went to England where he was appointed chief physician to Elizabeth I in 1586. He knew powerful men at court, and grew rich and respected. He was involved in various court intrigues until convicted of plotting to poison the Queen. He was hanged, drawn and quartered. 

Several contemporaries make reference to the trial and execution. Christopher Marlowe mentions it in "Doctor Faustus" as do Thomas Dekker in "Whore of Babylon" and Thomas Middleton in "A Game at Chess". It is possible that Shylock in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" was inspired by López. 

Queen Elizabeth I’s physician, Roderigo Lopez, was tried and executed for allegedly plotting to kill the queen in 1594. As a Portuguese double agent, ‘Doctor Lopez a Jew’ was said to have conspired with the Spanish, England’s enemies at that time. He was accused of attempting to kill the Portuguese King Antonio and ‘take away Queene Elizabeths life by poyson’, in return for ‘fifty thousand Crowns’

Arletty

Arletty (15 May 1898 – 24 July 1992) was a French actress, singer, and model. She played Garance in the French movie "Les Enfants du Paradis".

Les Enfants du Paradis

Les Enfants du Paradis ("Children of Paradise") is a French romantic drama movie. It was written by Jacques Prévert and directed by Marcel Carné and released in 1945. It stars Arletty as French courtesan Garance. She is loved by four men: a street mime, an actor, a criminal, and an aristocrat. The story is set among the lower class theatres of Paris between 1820 and 1840. Garance is courted by four men but leaves them all because they will not allow her to love in her own way. The three hour film has been described as France's "Gone with the Wind".

Dave Dryden

David Murray Dryden (September 5, 1941 – October 4, 2022) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender. Dryden was known for the distinction of creating (as well as being the first goaltender to employ) the modern day goaltending mask consisting of a fiberglass mask with a cage.

Before playing in the NHL, Dryden played 2 seasons in the OHA playing for the Toronto St. Michael's.

In the NHL, he played for the New York Rangers, Chicago Black Hawks, Buffalo Sabres and Edmonton Oilers. Dryden faced his brother Ken in a game between his Sabres and the Montreal Canadiens. It was the only time in the history of the NHL that brothers opposed each other as goalies.

Dryden was the goalie against whom Wayne Gretzky scored his first professional goal. During his time in the WHA, he played for the Chicago Cougars and Edmonton Oilers. He won the Ben Hatskin Trophy as the WHA's top goaltender, and the Gordie Howe Trophy as league MVP.

Since retiring from playing professional ice hockey in 1979, he became the chair person of Sleeping Children Around the World charity which was founded by his father and provides bed kits to children in developing countries.

On October 4, 2022, Dryden died at his home in Oakville, Ontario from a disease known as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

Michel Dumas

Michel Joseph Dumas (born July 8, 1949) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey goaltender. He currently works as a chief amateur scout for the Chicago Blackhawks.

Before playing in the NHL, Dumas played 2 games with the Oklahoma City Blazers and 3 seasons with the Dallas Black Hawks of the CHL. He also played 2 seasons in the IHL with the Dayton Gems.

He was called up to play for the Chicago Black Hawks for 3 games and went back down to the play 1 season for the Dallas Black Hawks again. He was called up again by the Black Hawks but he only played 5 games as his career was cut short due to an eye injury he suffered in a game against the Colorado Rockies in 1976.

He was hired by the Black Hawks tin 1977 to be an amateur scout, and was then promoted to be their chief amateur scout in the 1992–93 season.


IPad Air

The iPad Air is the fifth type of iPad made by Apple Inc. It was announced at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on October 22, 2013. It first came with iOS 7 installed on it and was upgraded to other versions later. The iPad Air contains the 64-bit Apple A7 processor and another M7 coprocessor. Apple released the iPad Air on November 1, 2013. It cannot be upgraded past iOS 12.

The iPad Air is 7.5 millimeters thick, which is thinner than both the iPad 2 and the iPad Mini. It has a smaller screen bezel which looks like the one on the iPad Mini. However, it still uses the same 9.7-inch Retina Display as the previous iPad model. 

Its successor, the iPad Air 2, was announced on October 16, 2014.

The iPad Air can run iOS 12. It can act as a mobile hotspot, sharing its internet connection over Wifi, USB, or Bluetooth. It can have access to the App Store, where users can buy and download mobile applications onto their device.

Universal Mobile Telecommunications System

The Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) is a third generation mobile cellular system for networks. It is based on the GSM standard and is part of the International Telecommunications Union IMT-2000 standard set. UMTS is developed and maintained by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project). It uses wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA) radio access technology so that users can transfer information faster.

Marinade

Marination is the process of soaking foods in a liquid before cooking. The idea is to add flavour, and to tenderize tougher cuts of meat.

The liquid in question, the 'marinade', may be acidic (made with ingredients such as vinegar, lemon juice, or wine) or enzymatic (made with ingredients such as pineapple, papaya or kiwifruit). In addition to these ingredients, a marinade often contains oils, herbs, and spices to further flavour the food.

The process may last seconds or days. Different marinades are used in different cuisines. For example, in Indian cuisine the marinade is usually prepared with a mixture of blends.

Hôtel Ritz Paris

The Hôtel Ritz is a grand hotel in the heart of Paris in the Place Vendôme. The hotel is ranked highly among the most prestigious and luxurious hotels in the world and is a member of "The Leading Hotels of the World".

The hotel has 159 rooms. It was founded by the Swiss hotelier, César Ritz, in collaboration with the chef Auguste Escoffier in 1898. The new hotel was constructed behind the façade of a Town house from the 18th-century. It overlooks one of the central squares in Paris.

It was one of the first hotels in Europe to provide a bathroom "en suite", a telephone and electricity for each room. It established a reputation for luxury. The clients have included royalty, politicians, writers, film stars and singers. Several of its suites are named in honour of famous guests of the hotel, for example Coco Chanel and Ernest Hemingway who lived at the hotel for years. One of the bars of the hotel, "Bar Hemingway", is devoted to Hemingway.

The Ritz has the reputation of being the most expensive hotel in Paris. The rooms as of May 2011 started at €850 a night. Suites start at €3,600 and cost up to €13,900 a night for the most expensive ones (the "Suite Impériale" is the most expensive). The Ritz employs more than 600 people.

"L'Espadon" is a world-renowned restaurant. It attracts aspiring chefs from all over the world who come to learn at the nearby Ritz-Escoffier School. The cuisine is run by the award-winning chef Michel Roth, the ninth head chef of the hotel. The restaurant was awarded a second star by the 2009 edition of the influential Michelin Red Guide.

During the Second World War, the German Luftwaffe used the hotel as local headquarters in Paris. The son of César Ritz, Charles, died in 1976. The last members of the Ritz family who owned the hotel sold it to the Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed in 1979. In August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales and Al-Fayed's son, Dodi, dined in the hotel's Imperial Suite before their fatal car crash.

The hotel is being entirely renovated. It has been closed since 1 August 2012 and will open its doors in March 2016, after a delay of nearly two years. Because of its status as a symbol of high society and luxury, the hotel has featured in many novels (for example F. Scott Fitzgerald's "Tender Is The Night" and Hemingway's "The Sun Also Rises"),
a play (Noël Coward's "Semi-Monde"), and films (such as Billy Wilder's 1957 comedy "Love in the Afternoon" and William Wyler's 1966 comedy "How to Steal a Million").

Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg

Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg (19 April 1795 – 27 June 1876) was a German naturalist, zoologist, comparative anatomist, geologist, and microscopist. He was one of the most famous and productive scientists of his time.

Ehrenberg was appointed professor of medicine at Berlin University in 1827. In 1829 he accompanied Alexander von Humboldt through eastern Russia to the Chinese frontier. After his return he began to concentrate his studies on microscopic organisms, which then were not much studied.

For nearly 30 years Ehrenberg examined samples of water, soil, sediment, blowing dust and rock and described thousands of new species, among them well-known flagellates such as Euglena, ciliates such as "Paramecium aurelia" and "Paramecium caudatum", and many fossils, in nearly 400 scientific publications. He was particularly interested in a unicellular group of protists called diatoms, but he also studied, and named, many species of radiolaria, foraminifera and dinoflagellates.

These researches built up our knowledge of the microorganisms of certain geological formations, especially of the chalk, and of the marine and freshwater accumulations. Until Ehrenberg took up the study it was not known that considerable masses of rock were composed of minute forms of animals or plants. He also demonstrated that the phosphorescence of the sea was due to organisms.

He was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences from 1836 and a foreign member of the Royal Society of London from 1837. In 1839, he won the Wollaston Medal, the highest award granted by the Geological Society of London. He continued until late in life to investigate the microscopic organisms of the deep sea and of various geological formations. He died in Berlin on 27 June 1876.

After his death in 1876, his collections of microscopic organisms were deposited in the Humboldt Museum at the University of Berlin. The "Ehrenberg Collection" includes 40,000 microscope preparations, 5,000 raw samples, 3,000 pencil and ink drawings, and nearly 1,000 letters of correspondence. His collection of scorpions, and other arachnids from the Middle East, is also held in the Berlin Museum.

Afro-Haitians

Afro-Haitians or Black Haitians, are Haitian people whose ancestors were Africans. Most Afro-Haitians are descended from West African slaves. The slaves were brought over to work in plantations, mainly for sugar canes.

The vast majority (about 90%) of Haitians are of African descent. Of them, about 25-30% are of mixed race or mulatto.

Haiti, just like in any region in the Americas, received slaves from all over West and Central Africa. Although Haitian slaves were from all over Africa, the most common were Kongos from the Congo region, and Ewe and Fon tribes of current-day Benin or Togo. There was also a lot of Igbo people from Nigeria.

Haitian Voodoo is obviously from the Fon people of Benin, when they came in large numbers as slaves to work in plantations as maids, farmers, and sugar cane cutters have kept their traditions strong and alive till this day after 300 years away from their original home.

The African influence can also be seen in the language Haitians use to speak; Haitian Creole is a French-based language with strong African influence in the phonetics, vocabulary, syntax, grammar, pronunciations. There are many words of African origin used in every day speech. Haitian food is mostly of African origin, including the names of the food. The music of Haiti is filled with African rhythms and instruments, the use of call and response as well as vocal African songs.

Mark Fitzpatrick

Mark Fitzpatrick (born November 13, 1968 in Toronto, Ontario) is a Canadian retired ice hockey goaltender.

Before playing in the NHL, Cloutier played 1 season in the BCJHL with the Revelstoke Rangers and 3 seasons in the WHL with the Medicine Hat Tigers whom he won the Memorial Cup twice with.

He was drafted by the Los Angeles Kings with the 27th overall pick in the 1987 NHL Entry draft. He played 17 games with the Kings and on February 22, 1989 he was traded along with Wayne McBean to the New York Islanders in exchange for Kelly Hrudey. He played 2 seasons with the Islanders. During his time with them, Fitzpatrick contracted Eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome, which is a potentially fatal neurological disease and it cost him almost all of the 1990-91 NHL season. He was able to recover and he returned to the ice in February 1992. He won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for his efforts in returning to the league after the illness in 1992.

On June 20, 1993, during the expansion draft for the Florida Panthers and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, he was traded to the Quebec Nordiques for Ron Hextall and a swap of first-round picks. After only four days, he was claimed in the expansion draft by the Panthers. He played 5 seasons with the Panthers where he played as a backup goaltender to John Vanbiesbrouck.

On January 16, 1998, he was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning with Jody Hull for Dino Ciccarelli and Jeff Norton. During his time in Tampa, he only managed record 7 wins in 34 games for the struggling Lightning who finished the season with the worst record in the NHL.

He was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks for Michal Sykora where he spent the season as a backup capacity to Jocelyn Thibault. He moved to Carolina Hurricanes for the 1999–2000 NHL season but spent most of the year playing in the International Hockey League for the Cincinnati Cyclones. He only played 3 games for the Carolina Hurricanes and spent another season in the IHL for the Detroit Vipers before he retired from playing professional ice hockey in 2001.


Emile Francis

Norman Tindale

Norman Barnett Tindale AO (12 October 1900 – 19 November 1993) was an Australian anthropologist, archaeologist and ethnologist. He worked for the South Australian Museum for almost 50 years. He is best known for his work mapping the various cultural groupings of Indigenous Australians.

He was born in Perth, Western Australia. His family moved to Tokyo in 1907, when he was a young boy. Norman was educated at the American School in Japan. The family returned to Perth in 1915, and then moved to Adelaide in 1917. Tindale got a job at the Adelaide Public Library. In January 1919, he got a job at the South Australian Museum as entomologist's assistant to Arthur Mills Lea. He had already published thirty-one papers on entomological, ornithological and anthropological subjects before receiving his Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Adelaide in March 1933.

Tindale began mapping the cultural groupings of Indigenous Australians early in his career. His interest in this began during a research trip to Groote Eylandt in 1921–1922. On the island, an Anindilyakwa man gave Tindale detailed descriptions of which land belonged to his family and which land did not. This led Tindale to question the widely held belief among European Australians at the time, which was that Aboriginal people were nomadic and had no connection to any specific area. Tindale's maps have been superseded by more accurate ones.

After his retirement from the South Australian Museum, Tindale began teaching at the University of Colorado. He lived in the United States until his death, aged 93, in Palo Alto, California.


Tindale was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1994, shortly after his death.


Savoy Hotel

The Savoy Hotel is a luxury hotel on the Strand in central London. It was built by impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte with profits from his Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and opened in 1889. It was the first in the Savoy group of hotels and restaurants, which were owned by his family for over a century. 

The Savoy was the first luxury hotel in Britain. It had electric lights throughout the building, electric lifts, bathrooms in most of the lavishly furnished rooms, constant hot and cold running water, and many other innovations. D'Oyly Carte hired manager César Ritz and French chef Auguste Escoffier, who established the highest quality in service, entertainment and dining. The hotel attracted royalty and other rich guests and diners. Winston Churchill frequently took his cabinet to lunch at the hotel.

The hotel became Carte's most successful venture. Its bands, Savoy Orpheans and the Savoy Havana Band, became famous, and other entertainers (who were also often guests) included George Gershwin, Frank Sinatra, Lena Horne and Noël Coward. Famous guests have included Edward VII, Enrico Caruso, Charlie Chaplin, Otto Hahn, Harry Truman, Joan Crawford, Judy Garland, Babe Ruth, Laurence Olivier, Marilyn Monroe, John Wayne, Humphrey Bogart, Elizabeth Taylor, Barbra Streisand, Bob Dylan, The Beatles and numerous others.

The hotel is now managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. It has been called "London's most famous hotel". It is still one of London's most prestigious and opulent hotels, with 268 rooms and panoramic views of the River Thames across Savoy Place and the Thames Embankment. The hotel closed in December 2007 for extensive renovations and reopened in October 2010.

Dorothy Kilner

Dorothy Kilner (17 February 1755 – 5 February 1836) was an English writer of children's books during the late 18th century.

Dorothy published her first books anonymously. She then published under the pseudonyms M. P. and Mary Pelham. This was common practice among female authors in that period.

Dorothy's most famous book was "The Life and Perambulation of a Mouse". This was published in 1784. Some other books of hers are "Anecdotes of a Boarding School, or an antidote to the vices of those Establishments" (1790), "Little Stories for Little Folks" (about 1785), and "The Village School" (1795). Most of her stories had moral lessons.

Dorothy was probably born in Woodford, which was part of Essex at the time. Her father was Thomas Kilner (1719–1804), a public servant and landowner. Her mother was Frances Kilner (née Ayscough; 1718–1768). Dorothy was the youngest of five children. The family lived in Maryland Point.

Dorothy was inspired to write through her friendship with Mary Ann Maze (Mary Ann Kilner, 1753–1831). The two became friends when they were children. They wrote many letters to each other on religious and personal matters. The letters were usually written in verse. Maze later married Dorothy's brother, Thomas Kilner (1750–1812) in 1774. Dorothy moved into their house in Spitalfields, and helped to raise their five children.

Both Dorothy and Mary Ann became writers, and wrote many books for children. Their books were published by John Marshall. Copies of their books were found long after their deaths in a trunk in their home in Maryland Point. Several titles continued to be reprinted for many years.

Lawrence Kohlberg

Lawrence Kohlberg (25 October 1927 – 19 January 1987) was an American psychologist. Today, he is mostly known for his theory, that the development of a sense of what is morally right or wrong occurs in different stages. There are three main stages, which are subdivided:

Ventriloquism

Ventriloquism is a form of stage theater in which a person changes his or her voice so that it sounds like the voice is coming from somewhere else (usually a puppet or a dummy). A ventriloquist is one who performs this art.

Originally, it was practiced in religion. Now, it is used in comedy.

Today's modern ventriloquism started in nightclubs.


Blobfish

The blobfish ("Psychrolutes marcidus") is three species of a fish of the family Psychrolutidae. They live in deep waters off the coasts of Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand.

Blobfish are typically shorter than 30 cm. They live at depths between where the pressure is several dozen times higher than at sea level.

Blobfish are often caught accidentally in bottom trawling nets. Scientists now fear the blobfish could become an endangered species because of deep-ocean trawling.

As often happens with common names, there is another fish which may also be called "blobfish". It is Macquarie blobfish, a species of "Ebinania".

Chac

Chac (also spelled Chaac) is the rain god of the Maya. He has a lightning axe. He uses it to hit the clouds and make thunder and rain.

Female genital mutilation

Female genital mutilation (FGM) is cutting off part or all of the female genitals that are outside of the body. FGM is also called female genital cutting and female circumcision. It is done for traditional reasons, as part of a ritual, not for medical reasons.

FGM is most common in 27 African countries, as well as Yemen and Iraqi Kurdistan. However, it also happens in other countries in Asia, the Middle East and around the world. Usually, FGM is not done by a doctor or in a hospital. It is often done with a razor blade or other sharp instruments, in many cases without anesthesia.

Different ethnic groups do different kinds of FGM. They also do FGM at different ages. Some groups do FGM when infants are only a few days old. Others do it when girls reach puberty, or are older. In about half the countries where FGM happens, most girls have FGM before they are five years old.

FGM can cause serious health problems, like infections, chronic pain, trouble getting pregnant and giving birth, bleeding so bad that it can kill. FGM does not make a person's health better in any way.

FGM is illegal in most of the countries where it happens. However, these laws are often ignored. Since the 1970s, many countries have tried to stop FGM. In 2012, the United Nations General Assembly said that FGM is a human rights problem, and voted to try harder to stop it. The World Health Organization and the "Maputo Protocol" to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights also say that FGM must be stopped.

There are many different types of female genital mutilation. The World Health Organization (WHO) has created four basic categories of FGM, called Types 1-IV.

In Type I FGM, part or all of the clitoris is cut off. The clitoris is the female organ that makes sex feel good for women. Without it, a woman usually cannot have an orgasm.
There are a few forms of Type II FGM. All of them involve cutting off part or all of the inner labia, the two flaps of skin on the sides of the opening to the vagina. The forms of Type II FGM are:

Type III FGM is usually called infibulation. It is the most severe form of FGM. The genitals outside a woman's body are cut off and the wound is sewn shut with thread and thorns. The different types of infibulation are:

When the labia are sewn shut, one small hole is left open so the girl can urinate and menstruate. The hole is kept open by putting something like a twig into the wound. To help the wound close, the girl's legs are tied together, often from hip to ankle, for up to six weeks.

After the woman gets married, her vagina is cut open so she can have sex. A midwife might cut open the vagina with a knife, or the woman's husband might tear it open with his penis. If the woman gets pregnant, the vagina is opened more for childbirth, and then often sewn back up afterward (this is called re-infibulation).

Type IV FGM is anything else that is done to hurt the genitals, like scraping, burning, scarring, or cutting the genitals without cutting them off. This procedure will be heartbreaking for women, when they get to know about this in later life.

In many countries where FGM is common, almost every woman and girl in the country has had FGM. In other countries, millions of women and girls have had FGM over many years.

In 25 countries in Africa and the Middle East, over 125 million women and girls have had FGM. This includes:
In some of these same 25 countries, FGM is very common. It is most common in these countries:

However, in other countries, FGM is not as common. For example, of the 25 countries where FGM happens most often, it is least common in these countries:

FGM can hurt women's physical and mental health throughout their lives.

The type of complications that a girl or woman might have from FGM depend on many things, like:

"Short-term complications" are health problems caused by FGM soon after the FGM happened. Common short-term complications include:

More serious short-term complications can cause symptoms that can kill a woman. They include:

Nobody knows how many girls and women die from FGM.

Late complications happen later on after FGM is done. For example:

Painful periods are common because it is very difficult for the monthly menstrual blood to get out of the tiny hole left by infibulation. Blood can fill the vagina and uterus, and stay there without moving. If the vagina gets completely blocked, the vagina and uterus can fill up completely with menstrual blood. Because women with this problem do not menstruate, and blood builds up in their abdomen (making it swell), it can be confused with pregnancy.

FGM may increase a woman's risk of having problems during pregnancy and childbirth. For example, women who had infibulations are more likely to:

FGM also raises the risk that a woman's baby will die soon after it is born. In 2008, the WHO estimated that 10–20 babies out of every 1,000 die because their mothers had FGM. All types of FGM were found to raise babies' risk of death, which was:

There is not much information about the effects of FGM on women's and girls' mental health. However, a few small studies have found that women with FGM often have anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Studies on how FGM affects women's ability to have sex have also been small. In total, in 2013, there had been 15 studies involving 12,671 women from seven countries. When all the information from these studies was put together, researchers found that:

Heat lightning

Heat lightning is the name for lightning from thunderstorms that are far away that is not followed by thunder. This happens because the lightning is far away and the sound of the thunder stops before it reaches the person watching the thunderstorm. Although it is named heat lightning, it does not have anything to do with the heat of the lightning itself. At night, lightning can be seen from up to 100 miles away, but the thunder doesn't go that far.

Heat lightning is often seen during the summer months. In Florida, heat lightning can often been seen over the water at night from thunderstorms that formed during the day.

Dry thunderstorm

A dry thunderstorm is a type of thunderstorm where there is lightning and thunder, but most or all of the precipitation does not reach the ground. They usually happen in deserts or areas with low water vapor. Because dry air usually absorbs liquid water, the rain is absorbed before it reaches the ground. They happen a lot during the summer months in western North America.

Dry thunderstorms are dangerous because they can cause dust storms and wildfires. Dust storms can happen because the dry soil and sand are picked up by strong winds. Wildfires can happen because the lightning can hit trees and there is no rain to put out the fires.

César Ritz

César Ritz (23 February 1850 – 24 October 1918) was a Swiss hotelier and founder of several hotels. He gave his name to the Hôtel Ritz Paris and The Ritz Hotel in London. His motto was "king of hoteliers, and hotelier to kings". His name is the origin of the word "ritzy".

At fifteen Ritz was apprenticed as a "somelier" (wine waiter) at a hotel in Brig. Dismissed after a year as an unsuitable candidate for the hotel trade, he went to Paris at the time of the 1867 Universal Exhibition.

Ritz's formative five years in Paris, including the siege of 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War, gave him sufficient polish and confidence to transform himself from a waiter and general factotum into a "maître d'hôtel", manager, and eventually hotelier.

In 1872, Ritz became floor waiter of the Hôtel Splendide in Paris, meeting many rich, self-made Americans as guests. In 1873 he was a waiter in Vienna at the time of the International Exhibition. In the winter of that year his astonishing career in hotel management began when he undertook the direction of the restaurant at the Grand Hôtel in Nice. Regular moves then followed. He followed the migration of the international tourist set from the hotels of Nice or San Remo in winter to Swiss mountain resorts such as Rigi-Kulm and Lucerne in summer.

In 1878, he became the manager of the Grand Hôtel National in Lucerne and held the same position, in parallel, at the Grand Hôtel in Monaco until 1888. A pioneer in the development of luxury hoteliering, he knew how to entice wealthy customers and got a reputation for good taste and elegance. He was the first to say that "the customer is never wrong". His code was "See all without looking; hear all without listening; be attentive without being servile; anticipate without being presumptuous. If a diner complains about a dish or the wine, immediately remove it and replace it, no questions asked".

In 1888, he opened a restaurant with Auguste Escoffier in Baden-Baden, and the two were then invited to London by Richard D'Oyly Carte to become the first manager and chef of the Savoy Hotel, positions they held from 1889 until 1897. Ritz put together what he described as "a little army of hotel men for the conquest of London". The Savoy under Ritz was an immediate success, attracting a distinguished and moneyed clientele, headed by the Prince of Wales. Aristocratic women, hitherto unaccustomed to dine in public, were now "seen in full regalia in the Savoy dining and supper rooms".

In 1898, Ritz and Escoffier were both dismissed from the Savoy. Ritz was implicated in the disappearance of over £3,400 of wine and spirits, as well as kickbacks from suppliers. The following report is from the London "Daily Telegraph":

Later in 1898, he opened the celebrated Hôtel Ritz in the Place Vendôme, Paris. He went on to open The Ritz Hotel in London in 1906, which became one of the most popular meeting places of the era, for the rich and famous. The Hotel Ritz Madrid in Madrid, opened in 1910, inspired by King Alfonso XIII's desire to build a luxury hotel to rival the Ritz in Paris. Ritz enjoyed a long partnership with Auguste Escoffier, the famous French chef and father of modern French cooking. The partnership lasted until Ritz had to retire in 1907 because of deteriorating health.

Ritz himself withdrew progressively from the affairs of his various companies, selling out his interests in hotels at Frankfurt and Salsomaggiore in 1905 and retiring from the Ritz Hotel Development Company in 1907, from the Carlton Hotel Company in 1908, and from the Paris Ritz Company in 1911.

By 1912, according to Marie-Louise Ritz, to all intents and purposes his life had finished. In 1913 he was placed in a private hospital at Lausanne, and the following year he was moved to another on Lake Küssnacht in Canton Schwyz. He died at Küssnacht on 26 October 1918. Although from a humble Swiss background, César Ritz and his luxurious hotels became legendary, and his name entered the English language as an epitome of high-class cuisine and accommodation. He is buried in the village of his birth.



Menu

A menu is a list of dishes to be served at a meal. Menus have been around in Europe since the 18th century. There is a special need for them in Chinese cuisine because of the wide range of dishes on offer. Menus have been discovered from the Song Dynasty in China. In the larger cities of the time, the variety of cuisine from different regions led caterers to create a list for their patrons.

In restaurants, the modern menu, with dishes in a set order of courses, was invented by the great French chef Escoffier. Usually there are two types of menu at a good restaurant:


Lesser establishments might offer a chalkboard, with the advantage that items can be rubbed out or added on at short notice. Fish restaurants in particular depend on daily catches being supplied or bought in the early morning. They usually list fish freshly bought (as opposed to frozen).

In American restaurant management, "menu engineering" has become a branch of marketing.

Virga

In meteorology, virga is precipitation that falls from a cloud but evaporates or sublimes before reaching the ground. It is seen a lot in deserts and temperate climates. These areas have low humidity and high temperatures which cause the rain to evaporate before reaching the ground. In North America, it is seen a lot in the Western United States and the Canadian Prairies. It is also seen a lot in the Middle East and North Africa.


Snow angel

Shock site

A shock site is a website that wants to be offensive and to shock people that see it. Shock sites usually show pictures that are meant to make people feel disgusted. These pictures are often violent, or pornographic. For example, in 2004 Goatse.cx showed a picture of a man stretching his anus. Often these sites are mentioned in emails, or online discussions, which tries to trick users into following links to another website.


Armillaria gallica

Armillaria gallica (or "A. bulbosa" or "A. lutea") is a species of honey mushroom in the order Agaricales.

The species is common and ecologically important. It decays wood. It can live as a saprophyte, or as an opportunistic parasite. In weakened trees it causes root rot. 

It is found in temperate regions of Asia, North America, and Europe. The species forms the above-ground fruiting bodies "(mushrooms") in soil or rotting wood. The fungus has been accidentally introduced to South Africa.
"Armillaria gallica" is a largely underground fungus. The fungus develops underground root-like structures, called rhizomorphs. These help it to decompose dead wood in temperate broadleaf and mixed forests. Its ability to bioluminesce and to form large and long-lived colonies are especially interesting.

"Armillaria gallica" was found in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the early 1990s. In one forest, "Armillaria"-infected oak trees were harvested, and their stumps left to rot in the field. Later, when red pines were planted in the same location, the seedlings were killed by the fungus. 

Using sequence analysis, the underground mycelia of one individual fungal colony covered , weighing over , with an estimated age of 1,500 years. 

The authors noted: "This is the first report estimating the minimum size, mass, and age of an unambiguously defined fungal individual. Although the number of observations for plants and animals is much greater, members of the fungal kingdom should now be recognized as among the oldest and largest organisms on Earth". 

After the "Nature" paper was published, media outlets from around the world visited the site where the specimens were found. As a result of this publicity, the individual acquired the common name "humongous fungus". There was afterward some scholarly debate as to whether the fungus qualified to be considered in the same category as other large organisms such as the blue whale or the giant redwood.

Affirmative action

Affirmative action (known as positive discrimination in the United Kingdom) is a policy where members of minority groups are given preference over members of more common or bigger groups. This is usually done to try to obtain some equality or balance. Positive discrimination is illegal in many countries, and is sometimes considered racial profiling.

It is most often found in education, employment and welfare.

Robinson Crusoe

Robinson Crusoe is a novel written by Daniel Defoe. It was first published on 25 April 1719 by William Taylor.

The novel's full title is "The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, Of York, Mariner: Who lived Eight and Twenty Years, all alone in an un-inhabited Island on the Coast of America, near the Mouth of the Great River of Oroonoque; Having been cast on Shore by Shipwreck, wherein all the Men perished but himself. With An Account how he was at last as strangely deliver'd by Pyrates".

The book is a fictional autobiography of the title character, Robinson Crusoe. Crusoe leaves the safety of his comfortable middle-class home in England and goes to sea. He is shipwrecked and becomes a castaway who spends years on a remote tropical island near Trinidad. He meets cannibals, captives and mutineers, and is eventually rescued.

For the first edition, Defoe pretended that the novel was a true story. He said the fictional protagonist Robinson Crusoe was the author and he pretended to be the editor of Crusoe's autobiography. This led many readers to believe that Crusoe was a real person and the book a true account of his life.

Many people think the story was influenced by the life of Alexander Selkirk. Selkirk was a Scottish castaway who lived for over four years on a Pacific island belonging to Chile called Más a Tierra. (In 1966, the island was renamed Robinson Crusoe Island.) However, there are other possible sources. For example, Ibn Tufail's earlier novel "Hayy ibn Yaqdhan", also set on a desert island, may have inspired Defoe.

Critical response to "Robinson Crusoe" has been diverse and argumentative. There has been widespread disagreement about the novel's nature and origin, values, structure, and meaning. Literary historians have not agreed on Defoe's sincerity, exact intentions, and achievement in the book.

"Robinson Crusoe" was very popular as soon as it was published. Before the end of 1719, it had already run through four editions. The novel's popularity has continued and it has become one of the most widely published books in history. It has prompted many imitations and adaptations for stage, film, and television.

Cloaking device

A cloaking device or invisibility cloak has long been featured in science fiction. Attempts have been made to devise a way to do it with objects, but results were disappointing until now. A paper in "Nature Communications" for September 2013 announces a new approach.

From reference 1, the two "supplementary movies" show the successful cloaking of a goldfish and a cat so far as they are within the experimental space.

A recent review said these methods were possible:

Over one hundred years ago, humanity was driven to the brink of extinction after the appearance of humanoid giants called Titans, who attack and eat humans on sight. According to what is known, the civilization within the walls is the last surviving remainder of humanity. Their civilization is surrounded by three circular walls called Wall Maria, Wall Rose, and Wall Sina. In the year 845, the outermost wall (Wall Maria) is breached by two new types of Titans, the Colossal Titan and the Armored Titan. This leads other titans to infiltrate the outermost areas of civilization and begin slaughtering its inhabitants. During this incident, Eren's mother is eaten by a Titan, and Eren swears revenge against all Titans. Eren enlists in the military and is also accompanied by his childhood friends Mikasa and Armin.

Five years after Shiganshina's fall, the Colossal Titan appears and attacks the city of Trost, located on the second innermost wall (Wall Rose). Eren helps to successfully defend the city after he discovers that he has the mysterious ability to turn himself into a sentient Titan at will. He additionally regains some memories of his father shortly after the fall of Wall Maria, telling him that the truth about their world can be found in their basement in Shiganshina. These events draw the attention of the Survey Corps and their commander, Erwin Smith, who intends to use Eren's power to reclaim Wall Maria and reach the Yeagers' basement to find the truth about the Titans. Eren, Mikasa, and Armin are transferred to the Special Operations Squad, under the care of Levi Ackerman and Hange Zoë.

The term is sometimes used of someone who is just very talkative. This is meant to be a humorous reference.

The dramatic monologue "Not I" by Samuel Beckett is an example of logorrhea. So is Lucky's speech in the play "Waiting for Godot".

In the 1999 E.W. Scripps National Spelling Bee, the spelling bee champion Nupur Lala won with the word logorrhea. Then a documentary, "Spellbound" was made about the spelling bee.

Spiritual warfare

Spiritual warfare is a Christian belief of fighting against bad supernatural forces (demons). The existence of bad spirits which can affect humans is the main idea for this belief system. Many Christian groups have used ideas of this movement to hold back these bad forces. These ideas mainly come from Christian demonology. A way to fight these forces is by using prayer. Exorcisms (removing demons), laying-on of hands, fasting, or anointing with oil are also used.


Some well known people, such as Bill Ellis, Elliot Miller (Christian Research Institute), and Gretchen Passantino have claimed that ideas in spiritual warfare are based on Christian stories that are not from the Bible. These stories are not considered true by Christians who believe that only the Bible is fact.


Procellariidae

The family Procellariidae is a group of seabirds. It is made up of the fulmarine petrels, the gadfly petrels, the prions, and the shearwaters. This family is part of the bird order Procellariiformes (or tubenoses), which also includes the albatrosses, the storm-petrels, and the diving petrels.

Puffinus

Puffinus is a genus of seabirds in the order Procellariiformes. It is made up of about 20 small to medium-sized shearwaters. Two other shearwater genera are named: "Calonectris", which comprises three large shearwaters, and "Procellaria" with another four large species. The latter are usually called 'petrels', although they are thought to be more closely related to the shearwaters than to the other petrels. Even though their name looks like "puffin", the puffins are auks, and not related to the shearwaters in the genus "Puffinus"; the genus name "Puffinus" is actually a New Latin loanword based on the English "puffin".

Shooting of Trayvon Martin

The shooting of Trayvon Martin was a killing which resulted in the death of a 17-year-old in Sanford, Florida, United States. It happened on the night of February 26, 2012. Martin was shot by George Zimmerman. The case has been given a lot of coverage by the media. Zimmerman was declared not guilty of manslaughter. However, many people believe Zimmerman racially discriminated Martin.

Trayvon Martin was African American. He was a 17-year-old high school student at the time. Martin had been walking to his father's girlfriend's house, where he was staying. He had gone to the 7-Eleven to buy a packet of Skittles. The house was in a gated community. The shooter, George Zimmerman, was the coordinator of the neighborhood watch in this community. Zimmerman is a mixed race Hispanic man. He shot Martin in the chest, killing the teenager.

When he was shot, Martin had been talking on his mobile phone to his girlfriend. He was wearing a hoodie. Zimmerman had thought Martin looked suspicious. He called the emergency telephone number (911) and the operator told him that he did not need to follow Martin. Zimmerman did anyway. People are not sure what happened after this. When police arrived at the location of the shooting, Zimmerman said that Martin had punched him in the nose and knocked him onto the pavement. Martin had not been carrying a weapon when he was shot. 

Police did not arrest Zimmerman until six weeks later. This was because of Florida's stand-your-ground law, which allows people to shoot others in order to defend themselves. Zimmerman was put on trial. On July 13, 2013, a jury decided that he was not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Protests were held in more than 100 cities in the United States by people who thought that decision was unfair. President Barack Obama spoke in response to public anger about the trial verdict on July 19. He said, "Trayvon Martin could have been me, 35 years ago". Maddy, a juror for the trial, told ABC News that Zimmerman "got away with murder".

The media coverage about this case has continued even after Zimmerman was declared not guilty.

Geraldo Rivera said on "Fox and Friends", "I think the hoodie is as much responsible for Trayvon Martin's death as much as George Zimmerman was." This made a lot of people angry. They said it was victim blaming.

An episode of the cartoon comedy "South Park", "World War Zimmerman", was shown in October 2013. It parodied Zimmerman's trial. Jack Cashill wrote a book about the case called "'If I had a Son': Race, Guns, and the Railroading of George Zimmerman". It was published in October 2013.

Zimmerman was arrested on November 18, 2013. Police said that he was going to be put in prison. TMZ said that Zimmerman attacked his pregnant girlfriend. He has been charged with aggravated assault, domestic violence battery, and criminal mischief. Zimmerman was released on bail.

In October 2013, Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, demanded changes to the Stand Your Ground law. She said the law "creates many opportunities for people to commit terrible acts of violence and evade justice". She and Martin's father, Tracy Fulton, started the Trayvon Martin Foundation in 2012 to help victims of injustice.

Neighborhood watchers in Sanford are now banned from carrying guns and following people. This is to avoid another event like Martin's killing and to make the neighborhood watch's reputation better.

Roman food

Roman food was mainly obtained from the Mediterranean area and Gaul (now France). Romans enjoyed foodstuffs from the trade networks of the Roman Republic and Empire. Keeping up the food supply to the city of Rome was a major political issue in the late Republic. It became one of the ways the emperor expressed his relationship to the Roman people.

Three meals a day was normal in ancient Rome, as today. In the morning, a breakfast called the "ientaculum" was served at dawn. Later, around 11:00 am, Romans ate a small lunch, and in the evening, they ate the "cena", the main meal of the day. In the Empire period, the "cena" increased in size and diversity. It was now eaten in the afternoon. The "vesperna", a light supper in the evening, was abandoned, and a second breakfast was introduced around noon, the "prandium".

In the lower strata of society, the old routine was kept: it corresponded more closely to the daily rhythms of manual labor.

Originally flat, round loaves made of emmer (a cereal related to wheat) with a bit of salt were eaten; among the upper classes, eggs, cheese, and honey, along with milk and fruit were also consumed. In the Empire period, around the beginning of the Christian era, bread made of wheat was introduced. Later, more and more wheaten foods began to replace emmer bread. Poor romans ate bread, vegetable, soup and porridge. Meat and shellfish were a luxury, unless they lived in the countryside and could go hunting or fishing.

The bread was sometimes dipped in wine and eaten with olives, cheese and grapes. They also ate wild boar, beef, sausages, pork, lamb, duck, goose, chickens, small birds and fish. Romans liked to make mealtimes fun by roasting hare with wings stuck on them to look like a flying horse.

At dinner slaves gave guests small hot bread rolls to wipe their plates clean. Roman flour contained a lot of dust and bits and this made bread so coarse that it wore down people's teeth. 
The wealthier Romans liked to eat snails flattened on milk, peacock's brains and flamingos tongues.

Among the upper classes, who did not do manual labor, all business was done in the morning. After the "prandium", a visit would be made to the baths. Around 2 p.m., the "cena" would begin. This meal could last until late in the night, especially if guests were invited, and would often be followed by a round of drinks.

In the period of the kings and the early republic, but also in later periods (for the working classes), the "cena" essentially consisted of a kind of porridge, the "puls". The simplest kind would be made from emmer, water, salt and fat. The more sophisticated kind was made with olive oil, with an accompaniment of assorted vegetables when available. The richer classes ate their "puls" with eggs, cheese, and honey and it was also occasionally served with meat or fish.

Over the course of the Republican period, the "cena" developed into two courses: a main course and a dessert with fruit and seafood (e.g. molluscs, shrimp). By the end of the Republic, it was usual for the meal to be served in 3 parts: 1 course ("gustatio"), main course ("primae mensae"), and dessert ("secundae mensae").

In contrast to the fine banquets, poor people ate the cheapest foods, so they had for breakfast grain made into twice-baked bread and porridge, and for lunch a vegetable and meat stew. The vegetables available included millet, onions, turnips, and olives with bread and oil on the side.
At dinner they had thin soup or meat with cheese, and a pudding of honey.

The Romans mainly drank wine, the main drink of the Empire, and water. The wine could be laced with spices and honey to improve the taste. Slaves poured wine and honeyed water in flasks. Slaves filled goblets with wine from large dishes. However, drinks such as milk were considered uncivilised and hence were only used for children, medical purposes and making cheese. The wine drunk across the empire was produced in Italy, Africa, Gaul, Spain and Greece. Beer was also drunk by Romans in Britain.

Roman kitchens were usually small rooms, simply equipped with built-in clay ovens and wooden cupboards. A charcoal fire heated a brick hearth, where the cook fried or cooked food in earthenware or bronze pots for baking or roasting. They placed meats in the ashes. The Roman kitchens were small compared to the one we have today. The kitchen would also have large jars of olive oil, wine, vinegar and fish sauces, as well as a mortar for grinding up spices. Only richer people had kitchens, although they didn't cook because their slaves did it. Despite the simple facilities, the cooks and slaves produced spicy dishes of shellfish, wild boar, fruits and sweets.

Catopuma

Catopuma is a genus containing two small Asian felines, the bay cat ("C. badia") and the Asian golden cat ("C. temminckii"). The bay cat is sometimes classified as "Pardofelis bardia", and the marbled cat is also in that genus. Because the genetic evidence is that all three cats are closely related, they will probably all be put in "Catopuma" eventually.

The bay cat and the Asian golden cat are typically reddish brown in colour, with darker markings on the head. They live in forests in South East Asia. The bay cat is only found on the island of Borneo.

Tommy Flowers

Thomas Harold Flowers, BSc, DSc, OBE (22 December 1905 – 28 October 1998) was a British engineer. During World War II, Flowers designed Colossus, the world's first programmable electronic computer, to help solve encrypted German messages.

The first Mark 1, with 1500 vacuum tube valves, ran at Dollis Hill in November 1943, and then at Bletchley Park in January 1944.

A Mark 2 redesign with 2,400 valves had begun before the first computer was finished. The first Mark 2 Colossus went into service at Bletchley Park on 1 June 1944, and immediately produced vital information for the imminent D-Day landing.

Flowers had a crucial meeting with Dwight D. Eisenhower and his staff on 5 June. A courier handed Eisenhower a note summarizing a Colossus decrypt. This confirmed that Hitler wanted no additional troops moved to Normandy, as he was still convinced that the preparations for the Normandy invasion were a diversionary feint. Eisenhower announced to his staff, "We go tomorrow".

Earlier, a report from Field Marshall Rommel on the western defences was decoded by Colossus and showed that one of the drop sites for a US parachute division was the base of a German tank division. The site was changed.

Years later, Flowers described the design and construction of these computers.

Penda of Mercia

Penda ( 606 - 15 November 655) was a 7th century King of Mercia. He was a noble of the royal house of Mercia and a pagan his entire life. Penda was the central figure in English history from 632 until his death. Penda treated every Northumbrian king as his enemy, especially if that king had any influence in southern England.

Penda was a son of Pybba of Mercia. At his father's death in Penda was still an infant. Ceorl ruled Mercia following Penda's father. There are indications Penda was an underking in Mercia probably in charge of Western Mercia. This would have included the territory of the Hwicce. Later Penda had close ties to the Hwicce when he was king of Mercia.

In 626, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: "This year Penda succeeded to the kingdom [of Mercia] and reigned thirty winters." As king of Mercia Penda's first victory came in 628. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 628 says that Cyngils, king of Wessex, and Cwichelm his son 'fought with Penda at Cirencester and came to an agreement with him there'. The 'agreement' seems to have been to give Cirencester to Penda. It's likely Penda also got the territory of the Hwicce at this time. The agreement or treaty also seems to have been a marriage alliance. Penda married Cynewise, probably a sister of Cynegils. He formed an alliance with Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd. Cadwallon was known to have been very hostile towards the Northumbrians. In 633 Penda joined him in invading Northumbria. At Battle of Hatfield Chase their combined armies defeated and killed King Edwin of Northumbria. Cadwallon remained in Northumbria for a year destroying everything he could. Penda left and returned to Mercia. He brought with him Eadfrith, the son of Edwin, as a prisoner possibly to set up as a puppet ruler in Northumbria under Penda. But Penda had him murdered a few years later. 

Sometime after 633 Penda killed two East Anglian kings, Sigebert and Egric, in battle. He set up a vassal king in East Anglia. About 635 Penda's brother Eowa became a king in Mercia along with Penda. Possibly he ruled northern Mercia while Penda ruled in the south. In Cadwallon, Penda's ally, was defeated and killed by King Oswald of Northumbria. The armies of Oswald and Penda met in 641 at Maserfelth (later called Oswestry in Shropshire). What events led to the battle is not recorded. Penda defeated and killed Oswald. This left Penda the most powerful king in England. Nothing indicates that Penda claimed to be overlord however. In 643 Cenwalh succeeded Cynegils as king of Wessex. Cenwalh married a sister of Penda of Mercia. But in 645 when Cenwalh her (set her aside) in favor of another wife, Penda invaded Wessex. Penda drove Cenwalh into exile in East Anglia. While in exile, Wulfhere, the son of Penda, took a great deal of territory away from Wessex. He gave the Isle of Wight to Aethelwalh, King of Sussex. Cenwalh returned to his kingdom . In 650, possibly to teach him a lesson for sheltering Cenwalh, Penda drove King Anna of East Anglia out of his kingdom. Penda killed Anna in battle in .

After King Oswald's death, Northumbria divided back into the two previous kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira. Each had their own king. Oswiu of Northumbria became king of Bernicia. He was Oswald's brother and Penda had a particular contempt for him. In 653 Deira came under Mercian control. In 654, hoping to put an end to Oswiu, Penda gathered all his allies and invaded Bernicia. Called the battle of the Winwaed he marched against Oswiu with 'thirty legions'. On Sunday, 15 November 655 the two armies met in battle near Leeds. Although he had the larger army Penda was killed. This established Oswiu as king of all Northumbria and as overlord of all the English south of the River Humber. Penda was succeeded by his son Peada.

Penda married Cynewise, his only known wife. All his children became Christian. Penda was the father of:

P. G. T. Beauregard

Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard (May 28, 1818 – February 20, 1893) was an American military officer, politician, inventor, writer, civil servant. He was the first prominent general of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. Today, he is known as P. G. T. Beauregard, but he rarely used his first name as an adult.

Beauregard was born on May 28, 1818 in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. He was raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. Beauregard studied at the United States Military Academy.

After the South seceded, he resigned from the US Army and became the first Confederate brigadier general. He commanded the defenses of Charleston, South Carolina, at the start of the Civil War at Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861. Three months later he won the First Battle of Bull Run near Manassas, Virginia.

Beauregard was married to Marie Antoinette Laure Villeré from 1841 until her death in 1850 after giving birth to their third child. They had three children, René, Henri, and Laure. Then he was married to Caroline Deslonde from 1860 until her death in 1894. They had no children.

Following his military career, Beauregard returned to Louisiana, where he served as a railroad executive. He became wealthy because of his role in creating the Louisiana Lottery.

Beauregard died on February 20, 1893 in his sleep from heart disease in his New Orleans, Louisiana home. He was 74 years old. He was buried at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans, Louisiana.



Ken Hechler

Kenneth William "Ken" Hechler (September 20, 1914 – December 10, 2016) was an American politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he represented West Virginia in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1959 to 1977. Hechler was the West Virginia Secretary of State from 1985 to 2001. He was currently the oldest living person to have served in the United States Congress.

Hechler was born in Roslyn, New York on September 20, 1914. He studied at Swarthmore College and later attended Columbia University.

Hechler faced a close race for the first (and as it turned out, only) time in 1972. Following the 1970 Census, West Virginia's population was low. The state legislature merged Hechler's district with most of the old 5th District, comprising several coal-mining counties around Bluefield and Beckley.

The 5th had been represented by Democrat James Kee of Bluefield since 1965, and members of his family had held the district continuously since 1933. On paper, the new district favored Kee, who retained 65 percent of his former territory. However, Hechler routed him in the Democratic primary by almost 26 points and easily won reelection in November. He was reelected in 1974 after being unopposed in the primary and general election.

In 1976, he entered a multi-candidate primary for governor, but lost that statewide race by a large margin. In 1984 he ran for West Virginia Secretary of State and won. He was re-elected in 1988, 1992, and 1996. n 1990, he again ran, in the middle of his Secretarial term, for his old Congressional seat, but was defeated by Rahall in the primary. In 2004 he ran yet again for his old post as Secretary of State. This time, he won the Democratic primary by a plurality, but lost the general election to Republican Betty Ireland.

Since 2004, Hechler has campaigned against mountaintop removal mining. On June 23, 2009, Hechler, then aged 94, participated in a protest near mountaintop removal mining sites in the West Virginia coalfields in the Coal River Valley along with others. He was one of 29 protesters arrested for trespass.

Hechler died under hospice care in Romney, West Virginia on December 10, 2016 from a stroke, aged 102.

Pybba of Mercia

Pybba ( ) (also Pibba or Wibba) was an early Anglian King of Mercia. He is the common ancestor of the Mercian kings in the four Mercian . As such he's considered by many historians to be the first known king of Mercia. He was the father of kings Penda and Eowa.

Pybba was the son of Creoda. The probable dates of his reign are from –. Henry of Huntingdon placed him in this same time period: "When Ceolric [ Ceol ] reigned over Wessex [591–597], Aethelfrith over Northumbria [593–616], and Pybba over Mercia, King Aethelberht of Kent and the Kentish people were converted to the faith [–]..." By this he is dated from the last decade of the 6th century into the first decade of the 7th century. The Mercian kings down to Ceolwulf all claimed to be descendants of Pybba. He also had a daughter who married (as his first wife) Cenwalh of Wessex Pybba either died or was deposed in .

Vocaloid

Vocaloid is a music software that's used to make vocals for music. It was created by Yamaha, a company that sells musical instruments, as well as other products. The user can type in lyrics and a melody and it will synthesize singing. Voicebanks for Vocaloid are made by recording samples of singers.

Vocaloid was developed partially through a research project led by Kenmochi Hideki. The people involved in this project later created the company Voctro Labs. Vocaloid was originally not supposed to be a commercial product, but with the help of Yamaha, became the program we know today.

Vocaloid originally only had an English version available, with two English voicebanks, Leon and Lola, being released for it. This changed later on with the release of Kaito and Meiko, which were both Japanese voicebanks.

Vocaloid is meant both for professional and amateur music makers, since Vocaloid is easy to use, so the only limit is the user's skill. Music groups like Livetune and Supercell have made music using Vocaloid voicebanks.

Vocaloid works by taking samples of singers and separating them into parts. These parts are used to form words. Vocaloid voices can be made to sound more realistic by using vibrato and changing things like how breathy a voice sounds.

Yamaha started working on Vocaloid in 2000. They announced it at a German music festival. Vocaloid was originally nicknamed "Daisy" as a reference to the song "Daisy Bell", but eventually they got rid of that name and decided to use "Vocaloid" instead.

Vocaloid 2 was announced in 2007. The way vocals were synthesized was changed, and so was the way the program looked.

Vocaloid 3 was released on October 21st, 2011. A lot of companies that made voicebanks for Vocaloid 2 upgraded their voicebanks to Vocaloid 3 because it sounded better.

Vocaloid 4 was released in 2015, and added a feature which let voicebanks made specifically for Vocaloid 4 sound like they were growling.

Vocaloid 5 was released in 2018, with an overhauled user interface and substantial engine improvements.

Seiðr

Seid or Seiðr is an Old Norse word for a kind of sorcery which was practised in Norse society. It is connected with Norse religion. No one knows where seid came from. It was practiced less with the spread of Christianity in Scandinavia. The practice was recorded in Norse stories (sagas) found by archeologists. Many scholars say that seid was like shamanism.
Both male and female Scandinavians practiced this form of magic. By doing so, they were often persecuted by society because they brought a taboo on themselves.

In pre-Christian Norse mythology, seid was associated with the god Odin, their god of war, poetry and sorcery. It was also associated with the goddess Freyja, who was their goddess of love and fertility.

Today, followers of modern paganism adopted forms of magic that they called seid. Their practices have since been studied by many researchers in the field of pagan studies.

Women in Ancient Greece

The status of women in Classical Greece was different in different city states. Women in ancient Delphi, Gortyn, Thessaly, Megara and Sparta could own land, which was the most prestigious form of private property at the time.

In ancient Athens, women were not citizens. Until marriage, women were under the guardianship of their father or other male relative. After marriage, their husband ("kyrios") acted for the wife in all legal matters. Athenian women had limited property rights. Athenian women could enter into a contract worth less than the value of a “medimnos of barley” (a measure of grain). This allowed women to engage in petty trading. 

Slaves, like free women, were not eligible for full citizenship in ancient Athens, but sometimes, rarely, they could become citizens if freed. Women, on the other hand, could never get full civil rights. No women ever acquired citizenship in ancient Athens, and so they were excluded from ancient Athenian democracy.

By contrast, Spartan women enjoyed a status, power, and respect that was unknown in the rest of the classical world. Although Spartan women were formally excluded from military and political life they enjoyed considerable status as mothers of Spartan warriors. As men engaged in military activity, women took responsibility for running estates. 

After many years of war in the 4th century BC, Spartan women owned between 35% and 40% of all Spartan land and property. By the Hellenistic period, some of the wealthiest Spartans were women. They controlled their own properties, as well as the properties of male relatives who were away with the army. Unlike Athenian women who wore heavy, concealing clothes and were rarely seen outside the house, Spartan women wore short dresses and went where they pleased. Spartan women rarely married before the age of 20: this was unusual in the ancient world. Girls as well as boys received an education, and young women as well as young men may have joined in the "Gymnopaedia" ("Festival of Nude Youths").

Some philosophers were in favour of equality for women, but not Plato and Aristotle. Contrary to them, the Stoic philosophers argued for the equality of the sexes. In their view, sexual inequality was contrary to the laws of nature. In doing so, they followed the Cynics, who argued that men and women should wear the same clothing and get the same kind of education. They also saw marriage as a moral companionship between equals rather than a biological or social necessity. The Cynics practiced these views in their lives as well as in their teachings. The Stoics adopted the views of the Cynics and added them to their own theories of human nature. They put their sexual egalitarianism on a strong footing.

Bahá'í calendar

The Bahá'í calendar, named the Badí‘ calendar ("badí‘" means "wondrous" or "unique"), is a solar calendar used by Bábism and the Bahá'í Faith. 

The calendar was created by the Báb and refined by Bahá'u'lláh and the Universal House of Justice. 

Each year starts on "Naw-Rúz", the vernal equinox (in March), and has 19 months. Each month has 19 days. An extra 4 or 5 days are added between the last two months so that the next year also starts on the equinox. Each day begins at sunset. The time of sunset and the time of the equinox are calculated by astronomers. 

The months are known by their Arabic names. The days within each month also use the same names. Here they are with their usual English translations:
Each group of 19 years is called a Váhid. 

Each group of 19 Váhids is called a Kull-i-Shay’.

Year 1 of the Badí' calendar started at Naw-Rúz in 1844 A.D.

Gertrude B. Elion

Gertrude Belle Elion (January 23, 1918 – February 21, 1999) was an American biochemist and pharmacologist. In 1988, she received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with Sir James Black, a British coworker.

Elion was born in New York. Elion wanted to pursue a job in science. Although women had a hard time getting a job in science during the Great Depression. Elion started as a cancer researcher in high school. She worked as a lab assistant, food analyst, and high school teacher for several years. While Elion worked, she earned her Master's degree at night. In 1941, she earned her M.S. (Master’s in science) degree in chemistry from New York University.

During World War II, the Wellcome Research Laboratories in Tuckahoe, New York hired Elion as a biochemist. In 1988, she and her colleague, George Herbert Hitchings, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. They both discovered and developed treatments for previously incurable diseases. Some of those diseases were leukemia and herpes. She became the senior research chemist. Later, she was promoted to the head of the Department of Experimental Therapy.

Elion discovered drugs to treat two deadly diseases. She treated Leukemia and Herpes. She tested her drugs on little children with the disease. She worked with a food and drug company. During her time there were no effective drugs. Because Gertrude discovered and tested these drugs, most children with Leukemia can now be cured. 

Acyclovir was the drug she and George Herbert Hitchings developed. Elion and George worked together. She trained a group that found a cure for AIDS and HIV.

Elion also stopped the rejection of kidney transplants, or when someone healthy donates their kidney to someone sick. While studying for her Master's Degree, she was a lab assistant, food inspector, and high school teacher.

Elion became president of the American Association for Cancer Research (1983-84). She was named the "Higuchi Memorial Award winner". She lectured at the University of Kansas in 1995. She also received a “Master of Science” award in chemistry from New York University in 1941.

Elion was hired as a biochemist during World War II. She focused on chemical compounds and nitrogenous bases. Elion also worked part time as a doctor in Brooklyn. She received an honorary doctorate, the highest medical degree, from George Washington University.

Elion was also the first woman to be admitted into the National Inventor’s Hall of Fame.

Elion graduated from Hunter College with a Bachelor of Art’s Degree in chemistry in 1937.

Gertrude B. Elion held 45 patents. Elion said that her 40 years of research resulted in many cures. Her research also helped many people discover deadly diseases. She also studied about the immune system and viruses as well as biochemistry and pharmacology.

Elion died on February 21, 1999, at the University of North Carolina Hospital.

Non-coding RNA

A non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is a functional RNA molecule which is not translated into a protein. Less-used synonyms are non-protein-coding RNA (npcRNA), non-messenger RNA (nmRNA) and functional RNA (fRNA). The term small RNA (sRNA) is often used for short bacterial ncRNAs. The DNA sequence from which a non-coding RNA is transcribed is often called an 'RNA gene'.

Non-coding RNA genes include abundant and important RNAs such as transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA); also RNAs such as snoRNAs, microRNAs, siRNAs, snRNAs, exRNAs, and piRNAs and the long noncoding RNAs (long ncRNAs). The number of ncRNAs in the human genome is unknown. However recent studies suggest the existence of thousands of ncRNAs. Since the function of newly identified ncRNAs has not been proved, it is possible that many are non-functional.

The first non-coding RNA to be analysed was an alanine tRNA found in baker's yeast. Its structure was published in 1965.

Handicap principle

The handicap principle was invented by Amotz Zahavi from Tel Aviv University. It claims to explain the fact that some animals have characteristics that do not necessarily help them survive. 

The peacock is an example. The peacock's tail is long and heavy and actually diminishes its chances of survival. The tail needs a great deal of energy to grow and maintain, it reduces the bird’s agility, and increases the animal’s visibility to predators. Yet, it has evolved. This shows that peacocks with longer tails have some advantage.

So why did it evolutionarily survive? According to the principle, one day, a mutant peahen that likes peacocks with longer tail, looked for a male with this characteristic. The mature male she found was strong enough to survive even though it had a long tail and therefore it is probably stronger than the average peacock. Therefore, its predecessor males are going to be stronger and also to have a long tail while the newborn females are going to like long tails, passing the ideals of the principle to the next generations.

This principle comes in addition to the well-known adaptation part of evolution theory claiming that the one who fits best to its environment survives.

GD 61

GD 61 is a white dwarf star. It is 150 light-years from Earth in the constellation Perseus.

An asteroid in the system was detected in 2013 that contains water. This was the first finding of solid or liquid water on an extrasolar body. The asteroid, the first extrasolar asteroid detected, is 26% water by mass, close to the water content of Ceres. This means that a planet, with a rocky surface similar to Earth's, may have existed in the past. The asteroid could be an artifact from this period. It is now possibly part of a debris field from that planet's breakup. Such a planet would have had both a rocky surface and water. These are two key ingredients for life. The researchers used the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope to determine what it is made of. The elements magnesium, silicon, iron and oxygen were detected. These are all components of rocky planets. However, the amount of oxygen is much higher than what was expected. There was also less carbon than expected. This meant there was one possible reason for the extra oxygen. There had to be water there.


Pilgrim of Eternity

"Pilgrim of Eternity" is an episode of "Star Trek" that was created by fans. It was released in 2013. It is the first in a planned web series, "Star Trek Continues". It is a sequel to the original series episode, "Who Mourns for Adonais?".


The crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise are looking into mysterious energy drains from power stations. They find an alien artifact, which begins to draw power from the ship. They destroy the artifact to save themselves, just after Spock (played by Todd Haberkorn) detects two life forms on it. The two forms then materialize on the bridge. one of them is the alien known in Earth's history as the Greek god Apollo (played by Michael Forest). The crew had met him only a couple of years earlier, but he has now aged. He says he was exposed to the energy draining properties of the Realm. This was the destroyed structure. It was built by his race to live in forever. It had malfunctioned and killed all the others of his race. He says he no longer wishes to have people worship him again. After a brief stay in the sick-bay, He starts to want people to idolize him for his singing and storytelling. Captain Kirk (played by Vic Mignogna) demands to speak with him about his behaviors. Apollo uses his telekinetic powers on the captain and others to make them worship him. Meanwhile, the remains of the Realm are still causing difficulties. A crew member dies while he and Sulu (played by Grant Imahara of "Mythbusters") are removing debris from the hull of the Enterprise.

Unlike other Star Trek fan productions, "Pilgrim" had a lead crew made up of film industry professionals. The creators attempted to recreate the style of the original series, in its sets, cinematography, costumes, and acting and storytelling style. They duplicated the dramatic pauses as used in the original, prior to commercial breaks. They primarily used the original series' incidental music, as well as the original theme song and iconic credit typography. They filmed in 4:3 aspect ratio to duplicate the original series' TV format.

Actor Michael Forest, in his 80's during filming, was written into the story as having been artificially aged, as he was supposed to have last encountered the crew of the Enterprise only a few years prior, according to the original series timeline.

As with all such Star Trek fan productions, permission to use copyrighted and trademarked properties from the original series are allowed so long as the production is not-for-profit.

The episode was first shown to the public at the Phoenix Comicon comic book convention on May 26, 2013, and was at the same time released onto the internet, on various streaming services.

Funds for continuation of the series are being raised in part from a Kickstarter campaign, held from Oct 7, 2013 - Nov 6, 2013, which has raised the set goal of $100,000. A second episode in the series, to be directed by Chris White, was in production as of October 2013.

Alternator

An alternator is a generator which converts mechanical energy to electrical energy in the form of alternating current. There is one in every car, with the exception of older cars that use a DC generator.

Most alternators use a rotating magnetic field with a stationary armature. The armature reacts to the rotating field and carries the current caused by the rotation. 

In principle, any AC electrical generator can be called an alternator, but usually the term refers to small rotating machines driven by automotive and other internal combustion engines. 

An alternator that uses a permanent magnet for its magnetic field is called a magneto. Alternators in power stations driven by steam turbines are called turbo-alternators.

Alternating current generating systems were known from the discovery of the magnetic induction of electric current. The early machines were developed by pioneers such as Michael Faraday and Hippolyte Pixii.

Capacitance

Capacitance is the ability of a body to store electric charge. A common device to do such task is a capacitor. The SI unit for capacitance is "farad".

Herman Kahn

Herman Kahn (February 15, 1922 – July 7, 1983) was one of the most famous futurists of the second half of the twentieth century. His theories helped to develop the nuclear strategy of the United States.

Kahn, a man of "captivating personality and large intellectual gifts", worked for the RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California, as a military strategist (19481958). He was a founder of the Hudson Institute think tank. This gives ideas and consultations for the U.S. government and military chiefs, and for business clients.

He was known for analyzing the likely consequences of nuclear war and recommending ways to improve survivability. His key idea was that the threat of nuclear war could be controlled by the use of carefully graded deterrence. In order to get his ideas across he ran two-day seminars which included role-playing in various scenarios. His ideas, when published in "On Thermonuclear War", caused a sensation.

However, responses must be proportionate, because if one threatened all-out war as a response for some rather modest misbehaviour, then the threat was simply not believable, and would not work. The need to think things through in detail was the topic of his second book, "Thinking about the Unthinkable".

Kahn was less successful later in his career when he turned his attention to general economics and politics. His ideas on Japan seemed good at the time, but now seem to be not quite right. He predicted that Japan would become the world's third superstate and a military superpower. This he based on Japan's record after 1946, which was spectacular, with quality production and undercutting markets in the older economies. As it turned out, Japan's economy stalled in the 1980s, and has never recovered its previous growth rate. The role he predicted for Japan is now filled by China, a country with a huge reserve of poorly-paid workers and significant military forces. However, Japan has the second largest economy in the region, and now has good relations with the U.S.A. 

Works written by Kahn include:

Enhanced geothermal system

An enhanced geothermal system (EGS) is a geothermal energy system that can make electrical energy when natural underground water is not there. 

For a long time, geothermal energy could only be produced where there were hot rocks, underground water, and cracks in rocks all together in one area. These areas may need underground water or a network of fractures in their rocks or both. 

Heat can now be got outside normal geothermal areas like active plate boundaries. It can be got in less active areas like the western United States.

The heat is got by artificially pushing water down into hotter rocks. This can create new fractures through the rock in addition to expanding the existing fractures. That is why the new technique is called "fracking".

It entered service in 1965, a while before it's competitors. Despite it being a British aircraft, half of the original orders were American. During the 1980s noise restrictions were passed, and most airlines wanted to hush-kit the aircraft instead of putting the aircraft out of service. They did this because at least half of the 1-11s still in service were fairly new; only 5-10 years old. During the early 1990s, more noise restrictions were passed, and this time, the planes were approaching retirement age anyway, so the BAC 1-11 saw most airlines retiring them in the 90s. The last ones in service were testbeds for the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, and those were retired in 2019.

Wulfhere of Mercia

Wulfhere or Wulfar ( 675) was an early King of Mercia. Although his father was pagan Wulfhere was a Christian. His older brother Peada ruled Mercia south of the River Thames under Oswiu of Northumbria. When Peada was murdered Oswiu held Mercia until the ealdormen of Mercia rebelled and placed Wulfhere on the throne. Wulfhere ruled Mercia from 658 until his death. He was the first Mercian (overlord) of England. 

Wulfhere was a younger son of King Penda. His older brother Peada accepted Christianity to marry the daughter of King Oswiu of Northumbria. After their father was killed by Oswiu, Peada was set up as a king of southern Mercia. Peada's wife murdered him within five months. Oswiu then took control of all Mercia and ruled it three years. The Mercian ealdormen Immin, Eafa and Eadbert rose up in rebellion against king Oswiu. Wulfhere, who had been kept hidden, was then proclaimed king. Wulfhere had little opposition from Oswiu as he was dealing with a rebellion in Northumbria. Wulfhere began building alliances with other kings in the south of England. His first may have been in about 660 when he married Ermenilda, the daughter of King Eorcenberht of Kent and his wife Seaxburh. About this same time he expanded Mercia to the west. He brought Shropshire and Herfordshire under his control. The kings of Essex submitted to his rule by 665.

By the time Oswiu died in 670 Wulfhere was the overlord of most of southern England. He installed Bishop Wine in London after he was expelled from Wessex by king Cenwalh. While Wulfhere did not directly control East Anglia he controlled Lindsey and Essex. By controlling all the surrounding lands, he probably forced East Anglia into a treaty. Wulfhere then made Athelwalh recognize his overlordship in Sussex. He expelled the West Saxons from Sussex and eastern Hampshire. Expanding to the east he made his Frithuwold King of Surrey in 670. When King Ecgberht of Kent died in 673 Wulfhere became the guardian of his two sons Eadric and Wihtred. He then ruled Kent through them. With Wulfhere's support, Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury presided over the Synod of Hertford in 673. In 674 Wulfhere decided to attack Northumbria. Oswiu's son Ecgfrith of Northumbria had put down a rebellion by the Picts when he became king. Wulfhere formed an alliance of most of the southern kings with the exception of Wessex. The southern alliance under Wulfhere was defeated by Ecgfrith in battle. While Wulfhere survived he was forced to pay to Ecgfrith. He soon lost his authority in Kent. Possibly in revenge for not joining him in fighting Northumbria, Wulfhere attacked Wessex. He was defeated by King Aescwine of Wessex in 674. Wulfhere died in early 675. He was succeeded as king by his brother Aethelred.

By his wife Ermenilda, he had:

Battle of Long Island

The Battle of Long Island was a major battle in the American war of independence. It is also known as the Battle of Brooklyn or the Battle of Brooklyn Heights. The battle which was fought on August 27, 1776, was a major victory for the British and defeat for the Americans under General George Washington. It was the start of a successful British campaign that gave the British control of the strategically important city of New York. In the American Revolutionary War it was the first major battle to take place after the United States declared independence in July, 1776. In terms of soldiers, it was the largest battle of the entire conflict.

General George Washington, Commander-in-Chief had defeated the British in the Siege of Boston on March 17, 1776. Washington then used the Continental Army to defend the port city of New York. At that time, New York City was only at the southern end of Manhattan Island. Washington understood that the city's harbor would provide an excellent base for the British Navy during the campaign. For this reason, he established defenses there and waited for the British to attack.

The British were commanded by General William Howe. In July his force landed a few miles across the harbor on sparsely-populated Staten Island. Over the next few months, new ships slowly reinforced their position in Lower New York Harbor. In August there were 32,000 soldiers, and the British controlled the entrance of the harbor at The Narrows. Washington knew that it would be difficult to hold the city against such a force. He believed Manhattan would be the first target and he moved most of his forces there.

On August 22, the British landed on the shores of Gravesend Bay in southwest Kings County, across The Narrows from Staten Island, more than 12 miles (20 km) south from the East River crossings to Manhattan. Washington brought some of his troops to northern Kings County, expecting to fight only part of the attacking army.

After five days of waiting, the British attacked American defenses. Unknown to the Americans, however, Howe had brought his main army around their rear and attacked their flank soon after. The Americans panicked, although a stand by 400 Maryland troops prevented most of the army from being captured. The remainder of the army fled to the main defenses on Brooklyn Heights. The British dug in for a siege but, on the night of August 29–30, Washington evacuated the entire army to Manhattan without the loss of materiel or a single life. Washington and the Continental Army were driven out of New York entirely after the battle of Fort Washington and other defeats, and forced to retreat through New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.

Siouxsie and the Banshees

Siouxsie and the Banshees were an English rock band. They were started in 1976 in London by Siouxsie Sioux and Steven Severin. They met at a Roxy Music concert the year before. The band broke up in 1996. They later performed together again in 2002 for a tour. They released 11 studio albums between 1978 and 1995. Their most popular song in the UK was "Dear Prudence", a Beatles cover. It reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. They were less popular in the United States, but their 1991 single "Kiss Them For Me" reached 23 on the "Billboard" Hot 100. They were also the second headliners for the first Lollapalooza.

The group played their first concert at the 100 Club Punk Festival. Sid Vicious played drums. Marco Pirroni played guitar. Without practising beforehand, they did a twenty-minute improvised version of the Lord's Prayer. The band had no name and was going to break up after the concert, but they were asked to play again.

Two months later Kenny Morris joined as a drummer and Peter Fenton as a guitarist. After a few performances, the band realized that Fenton didn't fit in and John McKay took his place.

In 1978, the band were signed to Polydor Records. They released their first single "Hong Kong Garden". It reached 7 on the UK Singles Chart. They released their first album, "The Scream", in November. It reached number 12 in the UK Albums Chart. It got mostly good reviews. "Sounds" said it was "the best debut album of the year".

Robert Smith was guitarist in the band's 1979 tour for "Join Hands". He joined the group again in 1982 to replace John McGeoch. He left in 1984 because he said that being in two bands at once was too much stress. He was replaced by John "Valentine" Carruthers. Before he left he wanted his time with the band to be documented, so the band released a cover of the Beatles' "Dear Prudence" with Smith on guitar.

Peter Edward Clark, known as Budgie, also joined the band for the "Join Hands" tour. He stayed a member until the band broke up. In 1987 Carruthers left and was replaced with Jon Klein. Martin McCarrick became the band's full-time keyboard player.

In 1987, the band released "Through the Looking Glass", an album of covers of songs by other musicians.

Between January and June 1988, the band recorded their ninth album, "Peepshow". It was released on 5 September 1988. It had a more pop sound than their previous albums. It got very good reviews. "Q" gave it 5 stars.

In 1991, "Superstition", the Banshees' tenth album, was released. The single "Kiss Them for Me" became their biggest US hit.

In 1995, they released their last album, "The Rapture". A few weeks later, Polydor dropped them from their label. Guitarist Klein was replaced with Knox Chandler for the band's last tour.



History of bus transport in Hong Kong

The history of bus transport in Hong Kong started in 1920 when the first bus route started providing service.

While there was the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, the Japanese government had tried to turn bus service to the status before the war. However, it wasn't successful since there has run out of petrol.

After WWII, the bus companies temporarily used vans to carry the passages. They used back buses after about 100 buses were bought from the UK.

Arrondissements of the Hautes-Pyrénées department

There are 3 arrondissements in the Hautes-Pyrénées department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into "arrondissements", which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture.

If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture.

Arrondissements are further divided into cantons and communes.

The arrondissements of the Hautes-Pyrénées are:

Aurangzeb

Muhi al-Din Muhammad (), better known as Aurangzeb () was the sixth emperor of the Mughal Empire. He ruled over the majority of South Asia and imposed Islamic Sharia law. His reign lasted for 49 years, from 1658 until he died in 1707. During this time, Aurangzeb greatly expanded the territory of the Mughal Empire with victories in South India. He was the last of the most powerful rulers of the Mughal dynasty. After his death, the power of the Mughal Empire declined quickly due to ineffective successors and the rise of the colonial British Empire whose conquests eventually led to British Raj.

His rule saw the spread of Islam in South Asia, and Islamic law was strictly imposed on all subjects of the empire, which led to dissatisfaction among the non-Muslim population towards the Mughal rule. Aurangzeb is often considered the most controversial Mughal ruler in India, as his rule involved the imposition of a discriminatory jizya tax on non-Muslims and the demolition of many Hindu temples.
