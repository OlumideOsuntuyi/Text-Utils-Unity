Rollo

Rollo (–), also called Rolf (Hrolf) was a Viking leader. In 911 he was given lands around Rouen by the Frankish king Charles the Simple. He passed on his ever growing fief to his descendants, known as the counts and later dukes of Normandy. He was the first of the dynasty known as the House of Normandy.

Rollo might have been a son of Rognvald, earl of More (in present day Norway) and was a Viking raider in France. He probably also raided Scotland and Ireland. Rollo played a part in the Siege of Paris (885–86) and then captured Bayeux according to Dudo of Saint-Quentin. While Rollo was given lands around Rouen in 911 by the French king, Flodoard of Reims says that there were many bands of Northmen raiding in western France at the time. In his writing he paid more attention to another group of Vikings under a Ragenold. Flodoard had no way of knowing then that of all the Viking bands those under Rollo would grow to become the great duchy of Normandy.

In 918 King Charles and Rollo met on the border of the Vexin and Roumois. The Roumois was the name then for the province of which Rouen was the capital. In a charter the king confirmed to Rollo the city of Rouen. He also gave him all the territory west to the border of Brittany. By 924 Normandy was growing into a principality. It was at this time he acquired Bayeux and also Maine. Rollo appears in annals only here and there. He was fighting over the castle of Eu against King Raoul. He also came to the aid of King Charles the Simple against Herbert II of Vermandois. Rollo died about 928. He was succeeded by his son William Longsword.

Rollo's first wife was Poppa. Together they had:


Rollo's second wife was Gisela, daughter of Charles III the Simple, King of France. They had no children.

Stepper motor

A stepper motor is an electric motor that is able to create sharp movements. It is used, for example, in printers. They are also commonly found in robots, automotive devices, and computer hard drives. Like other electric motors, they need an electrical circuit to work. Typically they have more than two wires to control them. There are several versions of stepper motors and several ways to drive them.

DC motors can be considered using two general categories, stepper motors and servo motors.
Servo motors needs a continuous feedback of position to control the state of the motor in order to give the motor specific or desired speed or position. These types of stepper motor are usually more expensive because they required additional circuitry to acquire this constant positional feedback.
The other type of generalized motor is called a stepper motor. This stepper motor is commonly used for simple experiments because it is inexpensive. It doesn't require the position of the motor to be known, hence it won't require additional circuitry. A stepper motor turns to a specific positions in using a constant sequence. This sequence can be achieved in multiple ways.
Full stepping, half stepping, and micro stepping are ways to achieve a sequence of steps from the motor. 
Full stepping with a two phase motor calls for two coils to be alternated simultaneously. This form of stepping will allow the motor to spin, but the angle of that spin will be based upon the step angle. The step angle is equal to the 360 degrees divided by the steps per revolutions. The steps per revolutions are found by the number phases on the stator times the number of permanent magnets available to the motor.

Blood donation

Blood donation is when a person voluntarily gives blood, which can be used for blood transfusions or to make certain drugs. Blood banks store this blood. The blood can be used to help the victims of accidents, for example. Usually, the blood donor and the donated blood are tested for diseases which spread through the blood. These include various forms of Hepatitis, HIV, Haemophilia and Syphilis. Usually, a series of questions also need to be answered to make sure that there is no risk to the person donating. 

A special case occurs before some medical operations. People donate their own blood, which can be used if they lose a lot of blood during surgery.

There are certain conditions on the people who can donate blood. Some of them vary by country, others are the same in most countries



In general, those donating blood need to be healthy.

Damascus Gate

The Damascus Gate (, "Sha'ar Sh'khem" means Nablus Gate; and , "Bab al-Amud", means the Gate of the Column) is the oldest gate of the of the Old City of Jerusalem. It was built in 1538 on a Roman gate that built before it. Inside the Old City, there was a round square before the gate with the Roman pillar that was the Kilometer Zero mark for measurements from Jerusalem to other cities. The pillar was destroyed and never found. But the Roman square with the gate was founded under the Damascus Gate. After the British Mandate of Palestine, the new Kilometer Zero was moved to the nearby Jaffa Gate. An ancient cave called Zedekiah's Cave is near the entrance to the gate. In the 2000s, a new amphitheater was built outside the entrance to the gate with 500 seats facing towards the front of the gate.

Agly

The Agly River (, ) is a river in southern France. It flows mostly to the southeast through the Plain of Roussillon, in the region of Occitanie. It ends in the Mediterranean Sea.

On its way to the Mediterranean Sea, it flows through the departments of Aude and Pyrénées-Orientales.

The Agly river is long. Its source is on the Pass of Linas, to the northeast of the Pech de Bugarach, the highest of the Corbières mountains, departments of Aude, at an elevation of .

It then goes into the Pyrénées-Orientales by the gorges of Galamus and flows into the Mediterranean Sea south of Barcarès.

There is a dam on the Agly river, on Caramany, Pyrénées-Orientales; it was built to prevent floods and to store water.

The Agly is a very irregular small river. Its flow was observed over a period of 42 years (1967-2008) in Estagel about twenty kilometers from its mouth and after receiving the waters of its tributary Verdouble.

The discharge of the river at this location is per second.

The Agly shows typical seasonal fluctuations like other small rivers in southern France. The highest levels of the river are in winter and spring, from December to May inclusive, with the highest level in February. They are followed by a rapid fall in the flow during the low water period that goes from late June to early October.

Header file

In computer programming, a header file can be thought of as a dictionary a compiler uses if it comes across a word it does not understand. Mainly programming languages like C and C++ use this.

As you may know, a computer is really powerful. But it lacks the power to think and learn. As a result, a computer has to be fed each and every instruction for a task you may want done. But it is not practical to type in each and every instruction again and again for a task, especially if you tend to use it a lot. As a solution to this, header files are used. For example, consider the word "cout" which is used by C++ to display outputs on the screen. The computer, however, does not know what "cout" is. So, it checks if "cout" exists in a dictionary file (i.e. the header file) that has been mentioned by the programmer. If it finds what to do when someone says "cout", the program will be compiled properly. Otherwise, it will simply result in an error that so-and-so word has not been understood by the compiler.
A HEADER FILE IN C++ CONTAINS:

Vaginal bleeding

Vaginal bleeding is any bleeding through the human vagina. That includes bleeding from either the vaginal wall itself or, more commonly, other areas of the female reproductive system. Vaginal bleeding may happen at any age, although it always needs investigation if encountered in girls or women after menopause. If the condition happens in pregnancy, that could indicate a medical need which should be addressed.

Teredo is available on Windows XP and later, and is enabled by default on Windows Vista to Windows 10 version 1709. It is also available on Linux and Unix, with a program called Miredo. Teredo was named after "Teredo navalis", commonly called a shipworm, which creates holes or tunnels in wooden ships.

A Teredo address might look like: 2001:0:4136:e378:8000:63bf:3fff:fdd2. This address has the Teredo server 65.54.227.120, the client IPv4 address 192.0.2.45, and the UDP port number 40000.

Oceanic whitetip shark

The oceanic whitetip shark ("Carcharhinus longimanus"), is a large species of requiem shark, in the genus "Carcharhinus". The oceanic whitetip shark reaches a maximum length of four metres, and can weigh as much as 170 kg (370 pounds). This species of shark can be distinguished by its large, rounded first dorsal fin, and its long, wide, paddle-like pectoral fins.

The oceanic whitetip shark should not be confused with the whitetip reef shark.

The oceanic whitetip shark is easy to distinguish. It has a large, rounded first dorsal fin, and very long, wide, paddle-like pectoral fins. The first dorsal fin is very large with a rounded tip, and is just in front of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is located over, or slightly in front of, the anal fin. This species has a whitish-tipped first dorsal, pectoral fins, pelvic fins, and caudal fin. The underside of the body is white, with a yellow tinge on some individuals.

Oceanic whitetip sharks can grow to large sizes, with the largest individuals reaching 3.5–4 metres (12–13 feet) in length. However, most specimens are less than 3 metres (10 feet) in length. The maximum recorded weight for this species is 170 kg (370 pounds). Males mature at 1.7-1.9 metres (5.6-6.2 feet) in length, while females reach maturity at slightly longer sizes of 1.8–2 metres (5.9-6.6 feet).

In the western Atlantic, the oceanic whitetip shark is found from Maine, U.S.A to Argentina, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. In the eastern Atlantic it is found from Portugal to the Gulf of Guinea, possibly occurring in the Mediterranean. In the Indo-Pacific, it is found from the Red Sea and East Africa to the Hawaiian, Samoan, Tahiti and Tuamoto islands. In the eastern Pacific it ranges from southern California to Peru, including the Galapagos Islands.

This shark is usually seen well offshore in deep water areas up to the depth of 152 metres (500 feet). On occasion it has been seen in shallower waters near land, usually near oceanic islands. Captured data in the Pacific Ocean shows that the abundance of this shark increases along with the distance from land. It is one of the top three most abundant oceanic sharks, with the blue shark and the silky shark.

Although this shark is mainly solitary, the oceanic whitetip shark gathers in groups when food is present. It is a slow swimmer, with equal amount of activity during the day and night. Reports show that the oceanic whitetip shark is usually found near the surface, swimming slowly with its pectoral fins spread widely. Oceanic whitetip sharks are often accompanied by remoras, dolphinfish, and pilot fish. An unusual behaviour was once observed in Hawaiian waters. The oceanic whitetip sharks were shown swimming along with pods of shortfin pilot whales. This behaviour was not fully understood, but was thought to be food-related. The oceanic whitetip sharks were thought to have been swimming with the pilot whales because the pilot whales were better at finding squid which the sharks also eat.

The oceanic whitetip shark is mainly solitary and swims slowly, and is usually seen cruising near the top of the water column, covering large amounts of empty water, searching for prey or any food source. Until the 16th century, sharks were known to mariners as "sea dogs". The oceanic whitetip shark, the most common ship-following shark, shows dog-like behaviour when it is attracted by something which appears to be food. It starts swimming greedily towards the food source, approaches cautiously but stubbornly. It keeps a safe distance if driven off, but is ready to rush in if the opportunity presents itself. Oceanic whitetip sharks are not fast swimmers, but they are capable of surprising bursts of speed. They commonly compete for food with silky sharks, often presenting aggressive displays. There does not seem to be segregation by gender and size. Oceanic whitetip sharks usually follow schools of tuna or squid, and trail groups of dolphins and pilot whales, scavenging their prey.

The oceanic whitetip shark feeds mainly on bony fish, including lancetfish, oarfish, barracuda, jacks, dolphinfish, marlin, tuna, mackerels, and threadfins. Other prey consists of stingrays, sea turtles, sea birds, gastropods, squid, crustaceans, and mammalian carrion (dead whales and dolphins). Feeding behaviour has been reported for this shark and includes biting into schools of bony fish. It also swims through schools of feeding tuna with wide-open jaws, into which the tuna unknowingly swim. The oceanic whitetip shark has also been observed eating garbage that is disposed of at sea. If other species of sharks are encountered by the oceanic whitetip shark during feeding activities, the whitetip becomes aggressive and dominates over them.

In the north-western Atlantic and the south-western Indian Ocean, the oceanic whitetip shark has been known to mate during the early summer. After a gestation period lasting around 1 year, the females give birth to around 1-15 pups. The oceanic whitetip shark is viviparous, and both genders reach maturity around the ages of 6–7 years, with the females being at a length of 1.8–2 metres (5.9-6.6 feet), and the males being at a length of 1.7-1.9 metres (5.6-6.2 feet). The young are around 60–65 cm long at birth.

Oceanic whitetip sharks are usually caught by shark fisheries. The meat is marketed fresh, frozen, smoked, and dried-salted for human consumption, the skin is used for leather, the fins used in shark-fin soup, and the liver oil is used for vitamins. It is also processed into fishmeals. Tuna fishermen dislike the oceanic whitetip shark as it has been known to follow tuna boats and damage or consume catches. Although this species is usually seen offshore, it is considered to be dangerous. It is usually the first species to be seen in waters surrounding mid-ocean disasters. During World War II, the "Nova Scotia", a steamship, was sunk by torpedoes from a German submarine off the coast of South Africa. Close to 1,000 men were on board, however only 192 survived. It was believed that many of the fatalities were victims of the oceanic whitetip shark in what eyewitness accounts described as a feeding frenzy.

In encounters with divers, ocean whitetip sharks have shown little fear, and usually investigate and circle around the ongoing activities. Due to this shark's opportunistic feeding habits and strong jaws, as well as its boldness and unpredictability around divers, this shark should be treated with extreme caution. Many attacks are caused when divers accidentally bump into the shark.

Although this species is listed as 'vulnerable' overall, it has been listed as 'critically endangered' by the IUCN in the north-western and western-central Atlantic. This is due to the massive decline in reported catches indicating that the population has decreased.

Maine (province)

Maine is one of the traditional provinces of France. It's capital was the city of Le Mans. The area is now divided into the departments of Sarthe and Mayenne.

The Carolingians called Maine "pagis cenomannicus" after the Cenomani tribe that Julius Caesar had defeated. Pepin the Short gave the duchy of Maine to his half-brother Grifo.
In the last half of the 9th century, Maine took on greater importance because of invasions from Normandy and Brittany. In 924 King Rudolph of France gave Maine to Rollo of Normandy. Because it was next to Anjou on the south and Normandy on the north, these two duchies often fought over Maine.

William, Duke of Normandy invaded Maine in 1063 and he controlled the county by the beginning of 1064. Norman control of Maine helped make the southern border of Normandy safe against Anjou. This was a factor which allowed Duke William to launch his successful invasion of England in 1066.

In 1069 the citizens of Le Mans revolted against the Normans. Soon some of the Manceaux barons joined the revolt. The Normans were expelled in 1070, and young Hugh V was made the Count of Maine. After Norman attacks in 1073, 1088, 1098 and 1099, Elias I succeeded his cousin Hugh V, who sold Maine to him in 1092 for ten thousand shillings. His daughter married Fulk V, Count of Anjou, who took Maine over in 1110 after the death of Elias. Henri Beauclerc, agreed to recognize him as Count of Maine.

Fulk's son Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou inherited Maine. In 1051 it passed to Geoffrey's son Henry, Duke of Normandy (later King Henry I of England). Anjou, Maine and Normandy now had the same ruler for the first time. Henry later founded the Plantagenet dynasty in England.

The King of France, Philippe Auguste attacked the Plantagenet holdings called the Angevin Empire when it was held by John, King of England. In 1331 the Count of Maine became a peer of the realm.

After the battle of Verneuil in 1424, the English occupied Maine. They held Le Mans until 1448 and Fresnay until 1449. In 1481, Charles V of Anjou left his lands to Louis IX of France. This act returned the county to the crown of France.

Urban design

Urban design is a subject of urban planning focusing on design of cities or other urban areas. Whereas architecture focuses on individual buildings, urban design is about the design of whole neighbourhoods and entire cities. It is about making them functional and attractive.
There are many problems that urban design tries to fix. One of them has to do with public health. One of the most talked about issues is about how easily people can walk to where they need to go. It became a bigger issue recently, not only because of the environment, but also because of people not being very healthy. Cities with a lot of gas cars hurt people. When people live around cars that blow smoke. people start to get really sick. People's hearts will beat in a weird way and it can lead to people dying. More people die from bad air each year than from getting hit by a car. That makes people want some changes. So they go out to say to people that the cities have to change. Instead of cars, they want cities to use trains for going really far, and they want cities to use bikes or buses to go not very far. Then they want people to be able to walk to any close by places. This would help public health double by getting rid of car smoke and getting people to walk more. This can help people's hearts beat normally and not let them die. It is also good exercise. There is evidence that cities can get people to walk more in them by having more open public spaces, stores within walking distance, grass, trees and other pleasing designs outside, and other things. It also helps with mental health, because people are more likely to talk to each other and that cuts down on loneliness.

The Book of Tea

The book is written for a Western audience. It was originally written in English. Okakura had been taught at a young age to speak English and was good at communicating his thoughts to Westerners. In his book, he discusses Zen and Taoism, but also the secular (non-religious) aspects of tea and Japanese life. The book emphasizes how Teaism (the art of tea) taught the Japanese many things. Most importantly it taught them simplicity. Kakuzō says that this simplicity, inspired by tea, affected arts and architecture.

When tea is more than a drink and the tea ceremony is understood and practiced to foster harmony in humanity, promote harmony with nature, discipline the mind, quiet the heart, and attain the purity of enlightenment, the art of tea becomes teaism. And it can be used to describe tea ceremony as the interests in tea culture and studies and pursued over time with self-cultivation. Teaism is mostly a simplistic mode of aesthetics, but there are subtle insights into ethics, and even metaphysics. Teaism is related to teamind. A sense of focus and concentration while under the influence of great tasting tea. Teaist is a person who performs or enjoys the art of tea and teaism. In Chinese, Japanese, and Korean cultures, they all have well-developed teaism.

Teaism is a synthesis of Taoism, Zennism, and tea. It is likely that it alludes more to the Taoist influences on Zen, and subsequently the Chado, or the Japanese tea ceremony, as he makes the statement, 'A subtle philosophy lay behind it all. Teaism was Taoism in disguise.' Teaism is brought out for its Taoist origins; but in the second half, it is shown through its manifestations in the Chado and in Japanese culture in general.

In this sense tea is more than a drink and more than an art, it is integrated in the culture and the mind. The term Chinese:chadao or Japanese:chado in English is a difficult translation task. In most common use and easy to express translation is "tea ceremony". A direct translation is "the way of tea" or "the way of tea". The term "teaism" is by some only signifies this with Japanese tea ceremony. Similar terms are "tea arts" and "tea culture". While the word lore is usually not used in this context, another term used is tea lore.

Voltage regulator

Voltage regulator is an elecrical component that maintains a constant voltage level. It stabilizes the voltage. For example, when a voltage regulator is fed a voltage that varies betveen 7.5 - 9.0 Volts, the regulator's output stays at exactly 5 Volts. Another way to stabilize voltage is by using a zener diode.

Zener diode

Zener diode is like a normal diode, but instead of being destroyed by a big reverse voltage, it lets electricity through. The voltage needed for this is called the breakdown voltage or Zener voltage. Because it can be built with a known breakdown voltage, it can be used to accurately measure voltage.

Breadboard

A breadboard is an electron tool which can be used to test electrical circuits. Instead of using soldering to connect wires and components together (like on a perfboard or printed circuit board), they can be stuck into the holes of the breadboard. It has metal strips inside that will connect them, and it lets them be removed easily or moved around when testing a circuit. 

The rows and columns of holes on a breadboard are usually labelled with numbers and letters. Everything in a row with the same number will be connected, except if the breadboard has a strip down the center. In that case, the metal is split and the row has two separate connections (one on each side). The center strip is also useful when connecting integrated circuits, because they can be pushed in over the top of it and have legs connecting to both sides without overlapping the connections.

22 or 24 gauge wire usually work best to plug into the holes in a breadboard.

Effect pedal

An effect pedal is an electronic device that can change the sound of an instrument or the voice of a person. Typical effects include echo, chorus, distortion, tremolo, reverb and flanger. A potentiometer is one of the electronic parts that effect pedals use to change the sound.

Effect pedals are commonly connected to electric guitars and bass guitars and to amplifiers using a cable, such as a phone connector. The pedal is then put on the floor and controlled using the player's foot. Depending on how the effect works, there are different ways to use the pedal:

Many guitarists like to use different effect pedals with each other. They stick them to a flat surface to make a pedalboard that they can take with them.

Neville Bonner

Neville Thomas Bonner AO (28 March 19225 February 1999) was an Australian politician, and the first Indigenous Australian member of the Parliament of Australia. He was appointed by the Queensland Parliament to fill a vacancy in the Senate. He later became the first Indigenous Australian to be elected to the parliament. Bonner was an elder of the Jagera people.

Bonner was born on Ukerebagh Island, in the Tweed River in northern New South Wales. He never knew his father and had very little education. He worked on a farm, and in 1946 moved to Palm Island, near Townsville, Queensland. He became Assistant Settlement Overseer.

In 1960, he moved to Ipswich, and joined the board of directors of the One People of Australia League (OPAL). This was an indigenous rights organisation. He became its Queensland president in 1970. He joined the Liberal Party in 1967 and held local office in the party. Following the resignation of Liberal Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin in 1971, Bonner was chosen to replace her. He became the first indigenous Australian to sit in the Australian Parliament. He was elected in his own right in 1972, 1974, 1975 and 1980.

While in the Senate he served on a number of committees. He was never a serious candidate for promotion to the ministry. He rebelled against the Liberal Party policy on some issues. Partly as a result of this, and partly due to pressure from younger candidates, he was dropped from the Liberal Senate ticket at the 1983 election. He stood as an independent and was nearly successful. The Hawke government made him a director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

Bonner was almost unique in being both an indigenous activist and a political conservative. He owed his political career to this combination. Other indigenous activists treated him badly, and they accused him of being a "token" in the Liberal Party.

In 1979, Bonner was jointly named Australian of the Year along with naturalist Harry Butler. In 1984, Bonner was made an Officer of the Order of Australia. From 1992 to 1996, he was member of the Griffith University Council. The university gave him an honorary doctorate in 1993. In 1998, he was elected to the Constitutional Convention as a candidate of Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy. 

He died in Ipswich in 1999, at the age 76.

The Neville Bonner Memorial Scholarship was set up by the Australian government in 2000. It gives money so that Indigenous Australians can study politics or related subjects at Australian universities.

The Queensland federal electorate of Bonner is named in his honour. A rugby league oval in Ipswich was named the Neville Bonner Sporting Complex in his honour. This oval was the home of an indigenous team, but is now the official home of the Queensland Cup team, the Ipswich Jets. The suburb of Bonner in Canberra, Australia's national capital, also bears his name. The head office of the Queensland Department of Communities, Child Safety and Disability Services is named the "Neville Bonner Building".

Bonner was an active boomerang thrower. One of his boomerangs can be seen at the Old Parliament House in Canberra.

Lowitja O'Donoghue

Dr. Lowitja "Lois" O'Donoghue, (1 August 1932 – 4 February 2024) is an Aboriginal Australian woman who worked as an administrator of several Commonwealth organisations. She was the founding chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). She was named Australian of the Year in 1984.

Lowitja O'Donoghue was born at Granite Downs, a cattle station located on the Stuart Highway in northwest South Australia. Her father, Tom O'Donoghue, was a stockman of Irish descent. Her mother, Lily, was one of the native Yankunytjatjara people. Tom and Lily met while Tom was working at Everard Park, another cattle station on the traditional country of the Yankunytjatjara. The couple moved to Granite Downs, known as Indulkana to the Yankunytjatjara, in 1925. Lowitja was born here around 1 August 1932. She was the fifth of six children.

In 1934, members of the United Aborigines' Mission visited the community at Indulkana. They persuaded Lowitja's mother that it would be best for her children to be brought up by the missionaries. There was no school in Granite Downs, and they were concerned about raising their children in such an isolated location. They moved with their children to Oodnadatta, and took them to the mission, which was run by the Baptist Church. Lowitja was baptised at the mission by a pastor. She was taken to be taught at Colebrook Children's Home, an Aboriginal school run by the mission in Quorn. She began learning there at the age of three.

Lowitja was two years old when she was removed from her mother. After she was removed, she did not see her mother again for 33 years. During that time, her mother did not know where her children had been taken. Despite this, Lowitja did not identify as a member of the Stolen Generations. She would later say that she preferred the word "removed" over "stolen" for her personal case. She has said she was happy living at Colebrooke and that she received a good education both there and at the Quorn Primary School. However, it is these sort of assimilation practises by the Churches that Lowitja and many others would eventually work to put an end to.

In 1944, Colebrook Home moved to Eden Hills in the south of Adelaide due to very bad water shortages. This allowed Lowitja to go to Unley High School, a local public school.

In 1979, Lowitja married Gordon Smart, a health care worker at the Repatriation Hospital. She had first met him in 1964. He died in 1991, and was buried at Quorn.

From 1950 to 1953, O'Donoghue worked as a nursing aide in Victor Harbor. The small local hospital did not run a training course. With the help of the matron, Lowitja applied to be a student nurse in Adelaide. The Royal Adelaide Hospital originally rejected her, but shortly afterwards she was offered a position as a student nurse in 1954. She qualified as a nurse and worked at the Royal Adelaide Hospital until 1961.

She spent time as a nurse with the Baptist Church working in Assam, in northern India. She replaced missionaries who were taking leave back in Australia. Due to the nearby Sino-Indian War, she was advised by the Australian government to evacuate to Calcutta from where she returned to Australia.

After returning in 1962, she worked as an Aboriginal Liaison Officer with the South Australian Department of Education. She later transferred to the state's Department of Aboriginal Affairs. She worked there as a Welfare Officer based mainly in the north of the state, including at Coober Pedy.

In 1967, Lowitja joined the newly formed Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs, which was in charge of Aboriginal welfare across Australia. She worked in the department's Adelaide office. After eight years, she became the Director of the department's office in South Australia. She was responsible for implementing the national Aboriginal welfare policy in South Australia. After a short while, she left the public service.

Lowitja was a chairperson of the National Aboriginal Congress for a short time in the early 1980s. She was later appointed chairperson of the Aboriginal Development Commission. In 1990, she was appointed chairperson of the newly created Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). In 1991, she, along with Alf Bamblett and Steve Gordon, became the first Aboriginal people to attend a Cabinet meeting.

Lesbianism in erotica

Lesbianism has been performed in visual arts since the times of ancient Rome. For much of history of cinema and television, lesbianism was regarded as taboo. But since the 1960s, it has increasingly become a theme within its own right. It was first used in softcore movies and erotic thrillers during the 1980s. Acts of lovemaking between women first happened during several movies in the late 1960s: "The Killing of Sister George", "Therese and Isabelle" and "The Fox". Lesbian scenes during movies are always subject to controversy. Many people say that the MPAA has been harsh on movies with homosexual themes. One notable example of this regards the movie "When Night Is Falling", which was given an NC-17. The movie, though, was released unrated.

The Killing of Sister George

The Killing of Sister George is a 1964 stage play and 1968 erotic drama movie. The story shows lesbian romances. Sister George is a character in the radio series "Applehurst".

In the United Kingdom, there were censorship issues. The movie was only passed under an X-rating in the United Kingdom after a part about lesbian sex was removed.

Inflatable boat

An inflatable boat is a kind of boat which is made from rubber. It is filled with air. In some boats is possible to install outboard motor. Inflatable boats are usually made to fit into small places so they can be moved easily. Some inflatable boats are rigid. They have a hard floor, and the tubes of the walls are strong so they can be inflated to high pressure and become stiff. 

Vulcanization of rubber became commonplace in the 1840s and was used for inflatable objects including boats. British explorers in the Arctic used Peter Halkett's boats. Since then, they have been used for many purposes.

Griffith later won the world middleweight title and claimed an early version of the junior middleweight world championship, a claim that has not been universally recognized although some consider Griffith a three-division champion fighter.

Jokichi Ikarashi

Jokichi Ikarashi (五十嵐 丈吉; "Ikarashi Jōkichi"; 26 January 1902 – 23 July 2013) was a Japanese farmer and supercentenarian, and the oldest man ever from Niigata Prefecture before 31 August 2018, when Chitetsu Watanabe surpassed his age and, at the time of his death, the oldest living Japanese man and the world's second-oldest living man.

Ikarashi was born on 26 January 1902 in Sanjo, Niigata, as the eldest of six children in a farmer family and worked as a rice farmer after graduating from elementary school to age 50–60, when he retired in order to take care of his wife, who was ill and died at age 68 in 1973, and their grandchildren, and later grew chrysanthemums until age 91 when he fall from a pine tree and broke his left foot, but did not otherwise suffer from any severe injury or illness, and did not either drink alcohol and smoke (and believed that as the secret to a long life). On his 110th birthday in late-January 2012, Ikarashi said jokingly that he "forgot to die" and wanted to live at least fifteen years longer. However, he was mostly bedridden and only able to eat liquid food during his time as a supercentenarian.

Ikarashi died of pneumonia at 11:06am on 23 July 2013 at age 111 years, 178 days, and was the oldest living Japanese man for almost six weeks after 116-year-old Jiroemon Kimura's death the night of 12 June, and was believed to be the world's oldest living man after the 135 days older Californian man James McCoubrey's death on 5 July. However, just two days after Ikarashi's death, the oldest living man was officially confirmed to be 112-year-old Spanish-born American Salustiano Sánchez, who died on 13 September the same year (coincidencially on the same day as McCoubrey would have turned 112).

Canigou

The Canigou () or Pic du Canigou is the highest of the mountains in Eastern Pyrenees; it is on the Massif du Canigou, in the department of Pyrénées-Orientales, southern France.

Because it has sharp sides and is close to the Mediterranean Sea coast, until the 18th century the Canigou was believed to be the highest mountain in the Pyrenees. On 21 July 2019, Abdullahi Abbas was officially the first Nigerian who succeeded climbing to the top of the Canigou.Pablo Bucheli, together with his sherpa Abigail White, was the first Ecuadorian on the top of the mountain.

Canigou is in the Regional Natural Park of the Catalan Pyrenees (; , often shortened as "Parc del Pirineu Català"), close to the eastern border of the park.

The Canigou peak is high. It is on a short mountain range, the Massif du Canigou, which is the eastern end of the Pyrenees. The mountain is the 395th highest mountain in France.

The first writings where the mountain is mentioned date from 949 with "Montis Canigonis" and "Monte Canigone" in Latin. The first written name of the mountain in Catalan ("Canigó") dates back to 1300, and from this comes "Canigou" in French.

The first ascent to Canigou was in 1285 by Peter III of Aragon, King of Aragon. This fact is mentioned in a chronicle written by Fra Salimbene, an Italian monk. It seems that the king did not go to the top of the peak.

Although the dominant climate is largely Mediterranean at its base, the Canigou has several climate zones:

Although variable from one year to the next, snow is generally continuous over , from mid-November to late May. The mean temperature in July is and in January is .

This mountain is a symbol for Catalan people. On its top there is a cross that is often decorated with the Catalan flag.

Every year on 23 June, the night before St. John's day ("nit de Sant Joan"), there is a ceremony called "Flama del Canigó" (Canigou Flame), where a fire is lit at the mountaintop. People spend the night there and take torches lit on that fire in a spectacular torch relay to light bonfires somewhere else. Some estimates conclude that about 30,000 bonfires are lit in this way all over Catalonia on that night.

The "Massif du Canigou" is a mountain range in the Pyrenees in the French department of Pyrénées-Orientales. It is the part of the Pyrenees nearest to the Mediterranean Sea.

There are two old monasteries at the foot of the mountain, "Martin-du-Canigou" and "Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa".

On 16 July 2012, the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy of France named the "Massif du Canigou" as a Grand Site of France.

The main peaks of this mountain range are:


Foreign relations of Vanuatu

Vanuatu has diplomatic relations with more than 65 countries. It has a very small network of embassies. Only Australia, France, New Zealand, and the People's Republic of China have embassies, high commissions, or missions in Port Vila. The British High Commission closed in 2005, after having been there for almost 100 years.
The government's main concern has been to improve the economy. It has a strong need for foreign aid, so Vanuatu has joined the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since 1980, Australia, France, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand have provided most of Vanuatu's development aid.
Vanuatu's foreign policy is fairly neutral. It stayed neutral during the Cold War. They have been a member of the Non-Aligned Movement since 1983. However, it has always given strong support for self-determination and decolonisation, especially throughout Melanesia. Vanuatu became independent from France and the United Kingdom in 1980. The first government recognised the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in November of the same year. It recognised the State of Palestine in August 1989. Later governments recognised Kosovo in 2010 and Abkhazia in 2011. Vanuatu has also supported the independence of New Caledonia and East Timor, and it strongly supports the Free Papua Movement in western New Guinea. Its relations with Indonesia have suffered because of this. Relations with Australia and New Zealand are a major focus of Vanuatu's foreign policy.
Vanuatu established diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1983, and Libya in 1986. It established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and the United States in June and September 1986, respectively. Relations with the United States were bad until the late 1980s. Relations with France remained bad throughout the 1980s. Vanuatu under Walter Lini also tried to create strong relations with Asia. By the end of the 1980s, the country had established diplomatic relations with the China, Japan, South Korea, North Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and the Philippines.

Australia and Vanuatu have very strong ties. Australia has given most of the help to Vanuatu's military. It is also Vanuatu's largest source of foreign investment, tourists, and foreign aid. Vanuatu also has strong ties to other Pacific countries. 
It is a full member of the Pacific Islands Forum, and several other regional organisations. It has been a member of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie since 1979. It was admitted to the Commonwealth of Nations in 1980 and to the United Nations in 1981. Vanuatu is currently the only Pacific nation that belongs to the Non-Aligned Movement.

The sporting events considered the most important in the Czech Republic are the Ice Hockey World Championships, the Olympic ice hockey tournament, the European football championship, and the football World Cup.

The Czech national ice hockey team is one of the most successful teams in the world. It regularly competes in the World Championships, the Olympic Games and the Euro Hockey Tour. The national team won their first Olympic Gold medal at the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano. The Czech team won six World Championship medals between 1996 to 2011.

The A7 series is an independent league. It was created for small and rookie teams. It is 7-on-7 football. The final match of the season is called Rice bowl. A7 series is less expensive than ČLAF so it can play teams from small towns which don't have sponsors.


Shooting is the third most popular sport in the Czech Republic. Winter sports are also very popular. The country has hosted world championship tournaments for Nordic skiing, ski jumping, and luge. Several Czech competitors have won medals in these kinds of sports internationally, including at the Winter Olympics.

William Longsword

William I Longsword ( – 17 December 942) was the second "Duke of Normandy". William added to his father's territories. He also began to expand Norman influence in West Francia (France). 

William was born to the Viking Rollo and his Christian wife Poppa of Bayeux. He was born overseas probably in England.

William succeeded his father as leader in 927 Early in his reign he faced a rebellion from by other Normans who did not think he was fit to lead them. The leader of this rebellion was Riouf of Évreux. At this same time William sent his wife Sprota to Fécamp where their son Richard was born.

In 933, William I Longsword swore to Raoul as King of Western Francia. In turn Raoul gave him lordship over much of the lands of the Bretons including Avranches and the Cotentin. But the Bretons fought to keep these lands. They were led by Alan II, Duke of Brittany and Count Berenger of Rennes. It ended shortly with Alan fleeing to England and Beranger seeking to be on friendly terms with the Normans. In 935, William arranged a marriage between his sister Adela and William, count of Poitou with the approval of Hugh the Great. At the same time William married Luitgarde, daughter of count Herbert II of Vermandois. Her dowry gave William the lands of Longueville, Coudres and Illiers l'Eveque. 
William Longsword attacked Flanders in 939 and Arnulf I, Count of Flanders, and Louis IV, King of France, attacked Normandy because of this. Arnulf captured the castle of Montreuil-sur-Mer defeating Herluin, Count of Ponthieu. Herluin helped William Longsword to take back the castle. William was excommunicated for attacking and destroying lands belonging to Arnulf. William pledged his loyalty to King Louis IV when they met in 940. In return for this he was confirmed in lands that had been given to his father, Rollo. Almost three years later, on 17 December 942 at Picquigny on the Somme, William Longsword was attacked and killed by followers of Arnulf while at a peace conference to settle their differences.

William had one son with Sprota.

Controlled-access highway

A controlled-access highway is a highway designed to allow traffic to safely travel at fast speeds. They are known by various terms around the world. The name motorway is used in the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand and some other Commonwealth nations. In North America and Australia, the name freeway is used. In Germany, they are called Autobahns.

These kinds of highways have four lanes or more. They carry many vehicles. They have no traffic-lights or ground level intersections. All roads crossing the highway go over a bridge or a tunnel. Ramps connect the highways to smaller roads and other highways. The place where highways meet these roads are called junctions or interchanges. Places where cars can leave or enter the motorway are called exits. Many freeways do not allow slower traffic, such as bicycles and pedestrians, to enter them.

Most controlled-access highways are divided with at least two lanes going each way, but they can be much wider in large cities.

Art Clokey

Arthur "Art" Clokey (October 12, 1921 – January 8, 2010) was an American animator. He was one of the first people to make stop motion clay animation popular. His work began in 1955 with a short movie called "Gumbasia". Clokey's work was influenced by his professor at the University of Southern California, Slavko Vorkapich. He and his wife Ruth later created the clay character Gumby. Gumby and his horse Pokey became popular characters on television. They first appeared in the "Howdy Doody Show", and later got their own series "The Adventures of Gumby".

Clokey was born Arthur Charles Farrington in Detroit, Michigan. When he was nine years old, his parents divorced. He stayed with his father, Charles Farrington. After his father died in a car accident, he went to live with his mother in California. However, his stepfather refused to raise another man's son, and so Arthur was sent to an orphanage. When he was 11 or 12, he was adopted by Joseph W. Clokey. Clokey was a classical music composer and organist who taught music in Claremont, California. He taught Arthur painting, drawing, and filmmaking.

The name of Gumby comes from Arthur's childhood, when he would play with a clay and mud mixture called "gumbo".

Before he made Gumby, Clokey did a few experiments with clay animation. Most of these were short movies for adults, including his first movie "Gumbasia". Clokey made this in 1953, and released it in 1955. It consisting of animated clay shapes dancing to jazz music. The title "Gumbasia" was named after Walt Disney's "Fantasia". In 1963, he made "The Clay Peacock". This was a reinvention of the animated NBC logo of the time. Clokey's third short movie was "Mandala" (6 minutes, 30 seconds). He made it from 1974-1977, and it was released on August 31, 1977. He described it as a metaphor for the evolving human consciousness. All three of these animations were later released to the public on several collections of "Gumby" television shorts.

"Gumbasia" caught the attention of Samuel G. Engel, president of the Motion Pictures Producers Association. He paid Clokey to make a short pilot for what became "The Gumby Show" (1957). In 1995, Clokey worked with Dallas McKennon to make "", a full-length movie. It was not very successful. In the mid-1990s, Nickelodeon signed a contract with Art Clokey to show every episode of "Gumby". It was on top of their ratings for over three years.

Clokey's second most-famous work was the "Davey and Goliath" cartoon.

Clokey died on January 8, 2010, at his home in Los Osos, California. He was 88 years old. He had been suffering from a infection of the bladder.


Bartlett's Familiar Quotations

Bartlett's Familiar Quotations (often called just Bartlett's) is an American reference book. It is a collection of quotations. The book was first printed in 1855. Its eighteenth edition was published in 2012.

The quotations are listed by the name of the writer. That is different from other books of quotations that list by subject. The writers are listed by date of birth, not alphabetically. Quotations are arranged in order by time within each writer's entry. The book has an index of the main words used in the quotations. It gives the source of each quotation.

John Bartlett ran the University Book Store in Cambridge, Massachusetts. People often asked him for information on quotations. He began a book of them for reference. In 1855, he privately printed his book as "A Collection of Familiar Quotations". This first edition had 258 pages of quotations by 169 authors. Many of the quotations were from the Bible, William Shakespeare, and the great English poets.

The book was a great success. Bartlett issued three more editions before joining the Boston publishing firm of Little, Brown, and Company. Bartlett supervised nine editions of the work before his death in 1905.

The tenth edition (1914) was edited by Nathan Haskell Dole. It began with quotations originally in English. Most of these quotes were from literary sources. After those, there was a section of quotations from politicians and scientists (such as "fifty-four forty or fight!"). After that, there was a section of translated quotations. Those were mostly from the ancient Greeks and Romans. The last section had quotations from the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer. Quotations were arranged in a single column.

The eleventh edition (1937) was edited by Christopher Morley (1890–1957) and Louella D. Everett. It had bigger pages and a two-column format. That is more like the format used today. A twelfth edition (1948) was also edited by Morley and Everett.

The thirteenth edition (1955) was called the "Centennial Edition." It was credited to the editors of Little, Brown, but the preface gives special thanks to Morley, Everett, and Emily Morison Beck (1915–2004). This edition included more recent quotations. The two youngest people quoted were cartoonist Bill Mauldin and Queen Elizabeth II. Beck also edited the fourteenth edition (1968) and the fifteenth (1980).

After Beck's retirement, Little, Brown made Justin Kaplan the editor for the sixteenth edition (1993). His book about Mark Twain, "Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain", had won the 1967 Pulitzer Prize. Kaplan was criticized for including only three minor Ronald Reagan quotations in this edition, and for saying publicly that he despised Reagan. (Franklin D. Roosevelt had 35 entries and John F. Kennedy had 28.) Kaplan was also criticized for including pop culture material.

The seventeenth edition (2003) had similar criticism. It included entries for the first time from J.K. Rowling, Jerry Seinfeld, and Larry David. Classic quotations were cut, including eleven quotations by Alexander Pope. Kaplan did include six Reagan quotations. He told "USA Today" "I admit I was carried away by prejudice. Mischievously I did him dirty."

The eighteenth edition (2012) was edited by poet, critic, and editor Geoffrey O'Brien. O'Brien is also the editor-in-chief of the Library of America.

"In addition to the prefaces of various editions of" Bartlett's, "the following sources were useful":

Separatism

In a society, certain people may have ideas that are noticeably different from those of the majority. These people are called separatists (for example, the state or a religious group) recognises that their ideas are different. Very often, they also want autonomy, self-determination, and perhaps secession and independence from the main group. People may support separatism because they are of a different culture, ethnicity, religion, race or gender than the majority. It may also be because they have different ideas about governing, laws or religion.

Ethnic separatism is based more on differences in culture and language than religious or racial differences. These may also may exist, however.

Racial separatists are against their members marrying with other races. They want separate schools, businesses, churches and other institutions or even separate societies, territories and governments.

Richard I, Duke of Normandy

Richard I of Normandy (933–996), also known as Richard the Fearless (French, "Sans Peur"), was the "Duke of Normandy" from 942 to 996. Richard made Normandy into a feudal society where he owned all the land. His followers held on to the lands given them by remaining loyal to him. He made Normandy a much stronger a power in western France. 

Richard was the son of William Longsword, princeps or ruler of Normandy. His mother's name was Sprota. She was a Breton prisoner captured in war who William later married. William Longsword was told of the birth of a son after the battle with Riouf and other viking rebels. But he kept this a secret until a few years later. When he first met his son he kissed him and made him the heir to Normandy. William then sent Richard to be cared for in Bayeux.

When his father died, Richard was only 10 years old (he was born in 933). King Louis IV of France decided to take charge of Normandy himself. The king placed the young duke in the custody of the count of Ponthieu. Then the king gave the lands in lower Normandy to Hugh the Great. Louis kept Richard a prisoner at Lâon. Fearing the king was going to harm the boy Osmond de Centville, Bernard de Senlis (who had been a companion of Richard's grandfather Rollo), Ivo de Bellèsme, and Bernard the Dane freed Richard.

In 946, Richard agreed to be a ward of Hugh, Count of Paris. He then allied himself with the Norman and Viking leaders. Together they drove Louis out of Rouen and took back Normandy by 947. In 962 Theobald I, Count of Blois, attacked Rouen. But Richard's army defeated them. Lothair king of West Francia stepped in to prevent any more war between the two. For the rest of his reign Richard chose not to make Normandy bigger. Instead he worked on making Normandy stronger.

Richard used marriages to build strong alliances. His marriage to Emma gave him a connection to the Capet family. His wife Gunnor was from a rival Viking group in the Cotentin. His marriage to her gave him support from her family. Her sisters married several of Richard's loyal followers. Also Richard's daughters provided valuable marriage alliances with powerful counts as well as to the king of England. Richard also made sure the church and the great monasteries were doing well. His reign was marked by a long period of peace and tranquility. Richard died in Fecamp, Normandy, on 20 November 996.

William married first (960)to Emma, daughter of Hugh "The Great" of France. They were promised to each other when both were very young. She died after 19 March 968, before they had any children.
Richard had children with his concubine Gunnora. Richard later married her to make their children legitimate:


Richard was known to have had several other concubines and had children with many of them.
Known children are:


Betsy Ross

Betsy Ross (January 1, 1752 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – January 30, 1836 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), born Elizabeth Griscom and also known by her second and third married names Elizabeth Ashburn and Elizabeth Claypoole, is widely known as making the first American flag. There is, however, no evidence that the story is true.


Douglas A-1 Skyraider

The Douglas A-1 Skyraider is an attack aircraft designed and built in the United States. Its first flight was in 1945, but it was too late to be flown in World War II. Originally designed for the US Navy, it was also used by the US Air Force, Fleet Air Arm and French Air Force. It was used by US pilots in the Korean War and Vietnam War, and by the French in the Algeria War. Some were modified for reconnaissance or electronic warfare. Before 1962, the US Navy's A-1 were called AD.

North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco

The North American Aviation OV-10 Bronco is a twin-turboprop reconnaissance and light attack aircraft. It was designed and built in the United States. The US Air Force, US Marines Corps, and US Navy used it in the Vietnam War. It was also used by the German and Indonesian air forces.

Spherical geometry

Spherical geometry is the use of geometry on a sphere. It was started for cartography, as well as for making maps of stars. It is different from Euclidean geometry (which is always on a plane), and Non-Euclidean geometry. Points are defined in the same way as they are in Euclidean geometry: A point is at a defined location on the sphere. A "staight line" is different though: It is the shortest path between two points, which stays on the surface of the plane. Some theorems of Euclidean geometry cannot be used on the sphere, many of them have been adapted though.

SPAD S.XIII

The SPAD S.XII is a French fighter aircraft of World War I. It was used by French pilots, but also by Belgians, British, and American pilots. More than 8400 examples were built.

Photobleaching

Photobleaching is when a dye or a fluorophore (a chemical that re-emits light) breaks down from exposure to strong light; similar to how the detergent chemical bleach breaks down dye in clothing.


Cotentin Peninsula

The Cotentin Peninsula (\kō-ˌtäⁿ-ˈtaⁿ\), also known as the Cherbourg Peninsula, is a peninsula in Normandy that is part of the coast of France. It extends in a northwest direction into the English Channel. To its west are the Channel Islands and to the southwest is the Brittany Peninsula. It is in the Departement of Manche, in the region of Normandy. The largest town is Cherbourg on the north coast. Cherbourg is a major port on the English Channel. The west coast of the Cotentin known as "Côte des Îles" ("Islands Coast") faces the Channel Islands. Ferry links serve Carteret, and the islands of Jersey, Guernsey and Alderney from the port of Dielette.

The peninsula formed part of what the Romans called Armorica. Coutances was the capital of the Unelli, a Gaulish tribe. It got its name "Constantia" in 298 during the reign of Roman emperor Constantius Chlorus. Under the Carolingians it became known as the Cotentin and was controlled by viscounts. For some time these were members of the Saint-Sauveur family. They lived at Saint-Sauveur on the Douve river.

In the ninth century, Vikings settled the Cotentin, which became part of Normandy in the early tenth century. Many place names there come from the Norse language. Examples include La Hague, and La-Hougue both derived from the Old Norse word "haugr" meaning a hill or mound. Until the construction of modern roads, the peninsula was almost inaccessible in winter because of marshland cutting off the higher ground. This explains occasional historical references to the Cotentin as an island.

King Alan the Great of Brittany waged war successfully on the Norsemen. As the result of his conquests, the Cotentin Peninsula was included in the territory of the Duchy of Brittany. After his death, the Norsemen invaded and occupied Brittany from 907 to 939. While they were eventually expelled by Alan's grandson, Alan II, Duke of Brittany, the subsequent rulers of Brittany were weaker than Alan the Great. The succeeding Dukes of Brittany suffered continuing Norse invasions and Norman raids. Eventually the Cotentin Peninsula was lost to the Brittany, and became part of Normandy.

In 1088 Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, gave the Cotentin to his brother Henry, later King Henry I of England. Henry, as count of the Cotentin, established his first power base there and in the adjoining Avranchin to the south During the Hundred Years' War, King Edward III of England landed in the bay of La Hogue, and then came to the Church of Quettehou in Val de Saire. It was there that Edward III knighted his son Edward, the Black Prince. A remembrance plaque can be seen next to the altar. The naval Battle of La Hogue in 1692 was fought off Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue near Barfleur.

The town of Valognes was, until the French Revolution, a provincial social resort for the , nicknamed the "Versailles of Normandy". The social scene was described in the novels of Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly (himself from the Cotentin). The grand houses and châteaux; were destroyed during World War II.

During World War II, part of the 1944 Battle of Normandy was fought in the Cotentin. The westernmost part of the D-Day landings was at Utah Beach, on the southeastern coast of the peninsula. What followed was a campaign to occupy the peninsula and take Cherbourg.

The main economical resource is agriculture. Dairy farming is a prominent activity. Along the west coast, renowned vegetables are grown, such as the carrots of Créances. The renowned trademark "Florette" was created in Lessay. The region is also famous for its shellfish culture. These include oysters from Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue and Pirou. Other products are alcoholic beverages like cider and calvados, made from locally grown apples and pears.

The region hosts two important Nuclear power plants. At Flamanville there is the Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant. The other is the COGEMA La Hague site. It is a large nuclear waste reprocessing and storage complex operated by Areva NC. The nuclear power industry provides many jobs in the region. The roads used for transport of nuclear waste have been blocked many times in the past by environmental action group Greenpeace. Local environmental groups have voiced concerns about the radioactivity levels of the cooling water of both these nuclear sites. These are being flushed into the bay of Vauville. However, the radioactivity is much lower than the natural background levels and does not pose any hazard.

There are two important naval shipyards in Cherbourg. The state-owned shipyard DCNS has built French nuclear submarines since the 1960s. Privately owned CMN builds frigates and patrol vessels for various states, mostly from the Middle East. Tourism is also an important economic activity in this region. Many tourists visit the D-Day invasion beaches, including Utah Beach in the Cotentin. At Sainte-Mère-Église a few miles away from the beach, there is a museum dedicated to the 82nd Airborne Division and the 101st Airborne Division. The "Cité de la Mer" in Cherbourg is a museum of oceanic and underseas subjects. The main attraction is "Redoutable", the first French nuclear submarine, launched in 1967.

Due to its relative isolation the Cotentin is one of the last remaining places the Norman language is spoken. The Norman language writer Alfred Rossel, native of Cherbourg, composed many songs which form part of the heritage of the region. Rossel's song "Sus la mé" ("on the sea") is often sung as a regional patriotic song.

Division of Northern Melbourne

The Division of Northern Melbourne was an Australian Electoral Division in the state of Victoria. It was one of the first 75 divisions set up for the first Federal election in 1901. It was located in the inner northern suburbs of Melbourne, including the suburbs of Carlton, North Melbourne and Fitzroy. It was abolished in 1906 when the boundaries were redrawn and mostly replaced by the Division of Batman.

The division was held by one member, H. B. Higgins. Higgins was Attorney General from 1904 to 1905. He was appointed a Justice of the High Court of Australia in 1906. Isaac Selby, who was an unsuccessful candidate in the 1901 election, became famous in 1905 when he tried to shoot a judge during a court case in San Francisco.

List of soups

Soups have been made since ancient times. This page lists a selection of well-known soups from the various cuisines around the world. They are sorted by the type of soup.

Some soups are served with large chunks of meat or vegetables left in the liquid; these are categorised below as "chunky". A broth is a flavoured liquid usually made from boiling a meat and bone or vegetable for a period of time in a stock. A common type of broth is consommé. A potage is a category of thick soups, stews or porridges. In some of them, meat and vegetables are boiled together with water until they turn into a thick mush.

Bisques are creamy soups traditionally made with shellfish, but can be made with any type of seafood. The base of cream soups is dairy. Chowders are thick soups usually containing some type of starch. Coulis were originally meat juices, and now are thick purees. Some soups are only ever served cold, and other soups can be served cold as an option.

Jo-Jo the Dog-Faced Boy

Fedor Jeftichew, better known as Jo-Jo the Dog-Faced Boy (1868 - January 31, 1904) was a Russian sideshow performer. Like his father, Adrien, with whom he performed, Jo-Jo was afflicted with hypertrichosis, an abnormal growth of hair over the face and body. Jo-Jo was covered with long, silky hair and was said to resemble a Skye terrier.

Jo-Jo was born in St Petersburg, Russia in 1868. He began touring Europe in 1873. He was five feet eight inches tall, had only four or five teeth, and spoke Russian, German, and a little English. He dressed like a Russian cavalryman. He would bark at an audience, and would perform as often as 23 times a day. In 1886, he was making US$500 a week.

Jo-Jo toured Europe and Russia, playing in fairgrounds. He was discovered by Charles Reynolds in London, England. Jo-Jo was performing with his father, Adrien, who resembled a poodle. Reynolds realized the Dog-Faced Boy could be presented in a more professional manner. He took the boy to the United States on the "City of Chicago" on 12 October 1884.

A press conference was called. Journalists were allowed to pull Jeftichew's hair to be assured it was real and not pasted on. The "New York Herald" described Jeftichew as "the most extraordinary and absorbingly interesting curiosity that has ever reached these shores."

In 1884, Jeftichew signed with P. T. Barnum. Barnum stated (falsely) that Jo-Jo was captured by a hunter in the wilds of central Russia. Barnum advertised him as "the most prodigious paragon of all prodigies secured by P. T. Barnum in fifty years. The Human Skye Terrier, the crowning mystery of nature's contradictions."

He toured Europe with Barnum and Bailey's Greatest Show on Earth in 1901 and 1902. He died in Greece in 1904 while on tour of pneumonia. He was the subject of a song recorded by Annette Funicello in the 1960s and was referenced in an episode of the television series, "Buffy the Vampire Slayer".

Sample

In statistics, a sample is part of a population. The sample is carefully chosen. It should represent the whole population fairly, without bias.

When treated as a data set, a sample is often represented by capital letters such as formula_1 and formula_2, with its elements being represented in lowercase (e.g., formula_3), and the sample size being represented by the letter formula_4.

The reason samples are needed is that populations may be so large that counting all the individuals may not be possible or practical. Therefore, solving a problem in statistics usually starts with sampling. Sampling is about choosing which data to take for later analysis. As an example, suppose the pollution of a lake should be analysed for a study. Depending on where the samples of water were taken, the studies can have different results. 

As a general rule, samples need to be random. This means the chance or probability of selecting one individual is the same as the chance of selecting any other individual.

In practice, random samples are always taken by means of a well-defined procedure. A procedure is a set of rules, a sequence of steps written down and exactly followed. Even so, some bias may remain in the sample. Consider the problem of designing a sample to predict the result of an election poll. All known methods have their problems, and the results of an election are often different from predictions based on a sample. If you collect opinions by using telephones, or by meeting people in the street, you won't ask people who don't answer phone calls or who don't walk on the street. Therefore, in cases like this a completely neutral sample is never possible. In such cases a statistician will think about how to measure the amount of bias, and there are ways to estimate this.

A similar situation occurs when scientists measure a physical property, say the weight of a piece of metal, or the speed of light. If we weigh an object with sensitive equipment we will get minutely different results. No system of measurement is ever perfect. We get a series of estimates, each one being a measurement. These are samples, with a certain degree of error. Statistics is designed to describe error, and carry out analysis on this kind of data.

There are different kinds of samples:
The way the sampling is obtained, along with the sample size, will have an impact on how the data is viewed.

If a population has obvious sub-populations, then each of the sub-populations needs to be sampled. This is called "stratified sampling". Stratified sampling is also known as "stratified random sample". Stratified sampling is often represented as proportion, such as percent (%).

Suppose an experiment set out to sample the incomes of adults. Obviously, the incomes of college graduates might differ from that of non-graduates. Now suppose the number of male graduates was 30% of the total male adults (imaginary figures). Then you would arrange for 30% of the total sample to be male graduates picked at random, and 70% of the total to be male non-graduates. Repeat the process for females, because the percentage of female graduates is different from males. That gives a sample of the adult population stratified by sex and college education. The next step would be to divide each of your sub-populations by age groups, because (for example) graduates might gain more income relative to non-graduates in middle age.

Another type of stratified sample deals with variation. Here larger samples are taken from the more variable sub-populations so that the summary statistics such as the means and standard deviations, are more reliable.

Hugh the Great

Hugh the Great or Hugues le Grand (895–16 June 956) was duke of the Franks and count of Paris.

Hugh was the son of King Robert I of France and Béatrice of Vermandois. She was the daughter of Herbert I, Count of Vermandois. Hugh was born in 895 in Paris, France. His eldest son was Hugh Capet who became King of France in 987. Hugh was a member of the family known as the Robertians.

In 922 the barons of western Francia revolted against the Carolingian king Charles the Simple. In his place they elected Robert I, Hugh's father, as King of Western Francia. Robert I died in battle at Soissons in 923. When Hugh refused the crown it went to his brother-in-law, Rudolph of France. Charles the simple asked his cousin Herbert II, Count of Vermandois for help in getting back his crown. But instead of helping the king he put him in prison. Herbert then used the threat of releasing his prisoner to get what he wanted. But Charles died in 929. From then on Hugh the great, acting for King Rudolph, had to struggle with Herbert II. Finally Rudolph and Herbert II came to an agreement in 935.

At the death of King Rudolph in 936, Hugh possessed nearly all of the region between the Loire and the Seine. This was the same territory as Neustria with the exceptions of Anjou and of Normandy. Hugh was one of those who brought Louis IV ("d'Outremer") from the Kingdom of England in 936. In 937 Hugh married Hedwige of Saxony, a daughter of Henry I the Fowler of Germany and Matilda of Ringelheim. Very soon however Hugh was quarrelling with King Louis.

In 939 king Louis attacked Hugh the Great and William I, Duke of Normandy. But soon after they made a truce which lasted until June. That same year Hugh, along with Herbert II of Vermandois, Arnulf I, Count of Flanders and Duke William Longsword paid homage to the Emperor Otto the Great. They supported him in his struggle against Louis. When Louis fell into the hands of the Normans in 945, he was handed over to Hugh in exchange for their young duke Richard. Hugh released Louis IV in 946 but made him surrender the fortress of Laon. In 948 at a church council at Ingelheim the bishops excommunicated Hugh even though he was not there. Hugh's response was to attack Soissons and Reims. Hugh finally changed his mind and made peace with Louis IV, and the church.

When Louis IV died Hugh was one of the first to recognize Lothair as his successor. For helping to have him crowned the new king gave Hugh Burgundy and Aquitaine. In the same year Giselbert, Duke of Burgundy acknowledged Hugh as his overlord and gave his daughter in marriage to Hugh's son Otto-Henry. On 16 June 956 Hugh the Great died in Dourdan.

In 922 Hugh married Judith, the daughter of Roger, Count of Maine and Rothilde. She died childless in 925.

Hugh's second wife was Eadhild, daughter of Edward the Elder, king of the Anglo-Saxons. They married in 926 and she died in 938, childless.
Hugh's third wife was Hedwig of Saxony, daughter of Henry the Fowler and Matilda of Ringelheim. She and Hugh had:

Richard II, Duke of Normandy

Richard II (23 August 963 - 28 August 1026), called the Good (French: "Le Bon"), was the Duke of Normandy from 996 to 1026. He was the first to assume the title of duke and built up his court to resemble that of a king. He commissioned Dudo of Saint-Quentin to write a detailed history of the Norman Dukes showing their and Christian patronage.

Richard II was the oldest son of Richard I the Fearless and Gunnora. He succeeded his father as Duke of Normandy in 996. During his minority, which was the first five years of his reign, his was his uncle Count Ralph of Ivrea. Ralph put down a peasant revolt at the start of Richard's reign.

Richard was very religious like his overlord king Robert II of France. Richard used his army to support the king against the duchy of Burgundy. He formed a marriage alliance with Brittany by marrying his sister Hawise of Normandy to Geoffrey I, Duke of Brittany. It became a double alliance when he married Geoffrey's sister, Judith of Brittany.

In the 980s the Vikings had been raiding England again. They would then cross the English Channel to Normandy to sell their plunder. Norman and Viking relations were good. Richard's father had hired Viking mercenaries in the 960s. He also allowed them safe haven in Normandy. This caused problems in England and with the Pope in Rome. In 990 representatives of the Pope negotiated a treaty between England and Normandy. Richard I agreed not to aid enemies of England (including Vikings). From 997 to 1000 a great Viking army attacked Wessex a number of times. In 1000 they came to Normandy and were allowed to land by Richard II. This broke the treaty between his father and the English king. In 1000-1001 the English attacked Normandy on the Cotentin Peninsula. The raid was led by king Ethelred the Unready of England. Ethelred had given orders that Richard be captured, shackled and brought to England. But the English were not prepared for the rapid response of the Norman cavalry and were quickly defeated.

Richard wanted to make peace with the English king. He gave his sister Emma of Normandy in marriage to King Ethelred. Ethelred gave Emma the city of Exeter as a dowry. This turned out to be an important marriage as it later gave Richard's grandson, William the Conqueror, a claim to the throne of England. In 1013 when Sweyn Forkbeard invaded England, Emma with her two sons Edward and Alfred fled to Normandy. After losing his throne King Ethelred followed shortly. Soon after the death of Ethelred, Cnut, King of England forced Emma to marry him. Duke Richard was forced to recognize the new regime as his sister was again Queen. 

Richard II commissioned Dudo of Saint-Quentin, his clerk and priest, to write about his ancestors. He was to tell the story of the Norman dukes in a way that showed their Christian morals. He wanted them shown to be good and upright leaders who built Normandy despite the bad behavior of their Frankish neighbors. It has been called by some historians a work of propaganda. While it contains a number of stories and legends, nowhere did Dudo claim the stories to be facts. When he wrote his work on the Customs and Deeds of the First Dukes of the Normans, Dudo seems to have met his goal "to tell in the noblest style the story of a noble destiny."

In 1025 and 1026 Richard confirmed gifts of his ancestor Rollo to Saint-Ouen at Rouen. He gave many other gifts to Monasteries. Their names show the areas over which Richard had ducal control: Caen, the Éverecin, the Cotentin, the Pays de Caux and Rouen.

Richard II died 28 Aug 1026.
He married firstly, , Judith (992–1017), daughter of Conan I of Brittany, by whom he had the following issue:

Secondly he married Poppa of Envermeu. They had the following children:

The Well-Tempered Clavier

The Well-Tempered Clavier (also known as WTC, BWV 846–893) is the title of two collections of musical works for solo keyboard instruments by the Baroque composer Johann Sebastian Bach. The first collection was written in 1722 and the second was written in 1742, but they were not published until 1801, fifty years after Bach died. Although the music was written for the harpsichord, which was popular at the time, today it is usually played and heard on a piano.

Both collections have 24 short preludes and 24 fugues to go along with it. All of them contrast with each other: some of them are easy to learn, while others are hard to follow (because there are many different melodies going on at the same time, which is called counterpoint). What is special about them is that each prelude and fugue is written in a different major or minor key. They appear in the book so that they go up by semitones. That is, the first prelude and fugue is in C major, the second is in C minor, the third in C-sharp major (or D-flat major), the fourth in C-sharp minor, and so on, until the last two preludes and fugues are in B major and B minor, in that order.

Other composers would later write music that is also in all 24 major and minor keys. The best known of these are the Preludes by Frédéric Chopin, but this would also later be done by Charles-Valentin Alkan, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Dmitri Shostakovich, to name a few.

Some of the music that appears in "The Well-Tempered Clavier" has become famous. For example, the French Romantic composer Charles Gounod wrote a setting of Ave Maria that is based on the melody of the first Prelude in C Major in the "WTC".

Boota Singh

Boota Singh (Gurmukhi: ਬੂਟਾ ਸਿੰਘ; Shahmukhi: بوٹا سنگھ), sometimes spelled as Buta Singh, was a Sikh soldier in the British Army. He served in Burma during World War II, under the command of Lord Mountbatten. He is very well known in India and Pakistan. He is famous for his tragic love story with a Punjabi girl who he rescued from the riots during the partition of India in 1947. 

Both fell in love and got married. Later, she was deported (sent back) to Punjab. Boota illegally entered Punjab to find her. She stayed away from him due to pressure from her family. Because of this, he killed himself by jumping in front of a moving train near Shahdara railway station in Punjab. He did this with his daughter, but she survived.

The love story of Singh's life has been adapted to movies and books, from both India and Pakistan. A Punjabi movie "Shaheed-e-Mohabbat Boota Singh" (1999) is entirely based on the story. Ishrat Rahmani wrote a book, "Muhabbat", based on the story. The story also influenced many other movies including "Partition", a Hollywood movie from 2007.

Singh lived in a village of Jalandhar district in British Punjab. When he returned home from fighting in Burma, his youth was over. All his friends were married with their own families, but he was still not married. He found no woman to marry him. Once a trader offered to sell Singh a bride from Uttar Pradesh or Bihar for rupees 2000/-. From this day onward, he started saving all his money for the dowry.

His uncle and cousins were wanting him to die unmarried, so that they could inherit his share of the family's land.

In his suicide note, Singh expressed his last wish to be buried in Noorpur village near Barki. This is where her parents had resettled after the Partition. The autopsy of Singh's body was done in a hospital in Lahore. It was taken to the town on 22 February 1957 for burial. However, the townsmen did not allow him to be buried there. Instead, Singh was buried at Miani Sahib Graveyard of Lahore.

In 1999, Manoj Punj directed a Punjabi feature movie, "Shaheed-e-Mohabbat Boota Singh", entirely based on the life story of Boota Singh. The movie stars Gurdas Maan as Boota Singh and Divya Dutta as the Punjabi girl. The music was composed by Amar Haldipur. It was a success internationally. It won the "National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Punjabi" at the 46th National Film Awards. It was also shown at many national and international movie festivals, including the 1999 Vancouver International Film Festival and the International Film Festival of India. Ishrat Rahmani wrote a novel on the love story, titled "Muhabbat". The story also featured in an English book, "Freedom at Midnight", by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre.

Frequency response

Frequency response is a measure of the range of bass, mid-range, and treble that your speakers can reproduce with clarity. The wider the frequency range, the more dynamic sound you’ll hear.

Systems respond differently to inputs of different frequencies. Some systems may amplify frequencies of certain range and attenuate the other frequencies. The way that the system output is related to the input for different frequencies is called frequency response. Frequency response means a graph where can be seen how something changes in different sound frequency. It is typically used in loudspeakers. Also audio crossovers way to function can be shown with frequency response.

The frequency response will be represented by two numbers and measured in Hertz (Hz) which is the unit of measurement for one frequency cycle. The first number represents the lowest bass frequency while the second number indicates the highest high-frequency an audio product can produce.

Sukhoi Su-25

The Sukhoi Su-25 is an attack aircraft designed and built in the USSR, and after in Russia. It was used by Soviets militaries during the war in Afghanistan.

First designed by Kenan and Haydn Douglas Griffiths of the soviet Air force research and development. Then The idea was expanded on by Eryk Deryniowski who then Went to transfer the idea on to Sukhoi. 

Audio crossover

Audio crossover is an electric circuit that separates low and high audio frequencies in a signal. It is needed because very small loudspeakers (tweeters) would break if fed by low frequencies. Likewise, bigger speakers (subwoofers) are not able to play higher frequencies purely.

Audio crossovers are divided to passive or active crossovers. Typical components used with passive crossovers are capacitors inductors and resistors. If passive crossover uses resistors to adjust loudness, those generate heat. Instead, active devices typically use resistors and capacitors with other audioelectronic components and those typically don't consume so much electric power. Also, active crossovers are easily built to be adjustable. Still, that doesn't mean that using passive crossover means low quality.

Gunnora

Gunnora (or Gunnor) (–), "Duchess" of Normandy, was the wife of Richard I, Duke of Normandy. She was an important figure in his reign and those of her sons.

Gunnora belonged to a family from the Pays de Caux area in Normandy. Gunnora was probably born . Her family was very influential in western Normandy and Gunnora was said to be very wealthy. Her marriage to Richard I was of great political importance. It allied him with a powerful rival family in the Cotentin. Her brother, Herfast de Crepon, was the of a great Norman family. Her sisters and nieces married some of the most important nobles in Normandy. 

At the time the Normans were used to more than one kind of marriage. Richard I wanted his son Robert to become the Archbishop of Rouen. He was told the church would not allow it because he and Gunnora were not married in a Christian ceremony. So he married Gunnora "according to the Christian custom", making their children legitimate in the eyes of the church.

Gunnora signed many ducal charters up into the 1020s. She was skilled in languages and had an excellent memory. She was a source of information on Norman history for Dudo of St. Quentin. Her husband depended on her as is shown in the couple's charters where she held several important positions. She was at times regent of Normandy, a and a judge. In a typical roll for a medieval aristocratic mother, she was an between her husband and their oldest son Richard II. As Richard I's widow she is mentioned as being active in her sons' careers. 

Gunnora was a founder and of Coutances Cathedral and laid its first stone. In one of her own charters after Richard's death she gave two pieces of land (called allods) to the abbey of Mont Saint-Michel. These were Britavilla and Domjean which were part of her dowry. She gave them for the soul of her husband, for her own soul and that of her sons "count Richard, archbishop Robert, and others..." She also signed a charter, , to that same abbey as "Gonnor matris comitis" (Gunnor, mother of the count). Gunnora, as wife and countess, was able to use her influence to see her kin favored, and several of the most prominent Anglo-Norman families on both sides of the English Channel are descended from her, her sisters and her nieces. Gunnora died .

Richard and Gunnora were parents to several children:

Boulton Paul Defiant

The Boulton Paul Defiant was a British fighter aircraft. This single-engine, aircraft first in August 1937 and was used by the British Royal Air Force in World War II. 

Defiants were different to other fighter planes because their guns (four Machine guns) were in a rotating turret and could fire in any direction. They had two crew: one man was the pilot and the other aimed the guns.

Defiants were made to shoot down enemy bomber aircraft. When they were used during the Battle of Britain, they were good at this. But they were slower and could not turn as well as German fighter planes, like the Messerschmitt Bf 109. A lot of Defiants were shot down by German fighters.

After the Battle of Britain, the British only flew Defiants at night. In this way they could attack the German bombers that also flew at night, and avoid the German fighters because they only flew during the day. 

Today, only one Defiant is left in the world; it is in a museum in London.

Shemini Atzeret

Shemini Atzeret ( – "the Eighth [day] of Assembly") is a Jewish holiday of the (Northern Hemisphere) autumn. In Israel, the date of the holiday is 22 Tishrei on the Hebrew calendar. Outside of Israel, it is two days long, on 22-23 Tishrei. On the Gregorian calendar, Shemini Atzeret comes in late September or early or middle October.

The holiday is best known for the celebration of Simchat Torah (שִׂמְחֵת תּוֹרָה), "Rejoicing of the Torah", when Jews finish the annual cycle of reading the whole Torah out loud in synagogue. Outside Israel, "Simchat" Torah is celebrated on the second day of the holiday. Most people outside Israel use the name "Shemini Atzeret" for the first day only. They call the second day "Simchat Torah" because of this celebration. In Israel, the one day of the holiday is called by both names.

In some ways, this holiday is part of the holiday of Sukkot. The "shemini" ("8th") is the "8th day" of Sukkot. In other ways, this holiday is a separate holiday on its own, and not part of Sukkot. 

Shemini Atzeret is an important Jewish holiday. Like on Shabbat and other important Jewish holidays, work is not allowed on Shemini Atzeret.

The holiday of Shemini Atzeret is in the Torah (Pentateuch) twice, at and at . The Torah does not say much about the holiday, though.

The Torah says that this holiday falls on the eighth day of Sukkot. However, in the same paragraph, the celebrations of Sukkot are described as lasting "seven" days, not eight. The Talmud writes about this apparent problem. At the end of the section, the Talmud says that at the same time,
The laws and customs of Shemini Atzeret show both pieces of the holiday.



Some Jewish holidays have special rituals, like the Seder of Passover or the sukkah, lulav and etrog of Sukkot. In the Torah, there are no rituals like that for Shemini Atzeret. But starting at the time of the Talmud, Shemini Atzeret became the holiday for finishing the annual reading of the Torah in the synagogue. The celebration of that—called Simchat Torah— has become the main feature of the holiday.
In synagogues, one section of the Torah is read on every Shabbat of the year. The last section, from Deuteronomy, is read on the holiday of Shemini Atzeret. Over the last 1000 years, the reading of the last section has become a big celebration called Simchat Torah, or "Rejoicing of the Torah". This celebration is so important that the whole day of the celebration is called "Simchat Torah." In Israel, this celebration happens on the single day of the holiday, 22 Tishrei. Outside of Israel, it happens on the second of the two days, 23 Tishrei.
The name "Simchat Torah" does not appear in the Torah or the Talmud. The Talmud says that the final section of the Torah is read on Shemini Atzeret. But it does not use the name Simchat Torah, and it does not describe a special celebration. The first reference to any kind of celebration comes from the period of the "Geonim" (7th-11th centuries CE). That source mentioned the custom of dancing with the Torah, which is still a custom today.

In modern times, Simchat Torah has become a day to show Jewish pride in public. 

Simchat Torah evening is a wikt:festive and child-friendly holiday. After the regular holiday evening prayers, all the Torahs are taken from the wikt:ark. Members of the synagogue march or dance around the synagogue seven times with the Torahs. Each time around the synagogue, the people pray "Save us! Answer us on the day we call!" Sometimes the dancing moves from the synagogue to the street outside. Sometimes the dancing can go late into the evening, with extra songs and prayers added. One very common custom is for people—especially children—to march or dance with flags, sometimes with candles or apples on top. At the end of the dancing in most synagogues, a piece of the last Torah portion in Deuteronomy is read in public. In Orthodox and Conservative synagogues, the very end of Deuteronomy is not read at night. But in Reform synagogues, it sometimes is.
After the regular holiday morning prayers, the dancing and marching of the previous night are repeated. After that, every wikt:eligible adult member of the synagogue is called to the Torah for an "aliyah" (honor), says blessings, and has several verses of the Torah read. Depending on the size of the synagogue, this can take a long time. Different synagogues have different ways to do this:
Once all eligible adults have received an honor, the celebration comes to its highest point. The last three honors go to distinguished members of the synagogue:
For all of these honors, the person honored stands under a "tallit" (prayer ) held open like the "ḥuppa," or , in a Jewish wedding.

In Israel, it has become common to add an extra night of celebration to Simchat Torah. This is called "Hakafot Shniyot" (Second Circuits). It happens on 23 Tishrei, the same night as Jews in the rest of the world celebrate Simchat Torah. This is a way for Jews around the world to show Jewish pride together. Because the holiday of Shemini Atzeret is over after one day in Israel, holiday restrictions do not apply. So "Hakafot Shniyot" can include things not normally allowed on Shabbat and Jewish holidays (like bands and photography).

The Torah states that it is a requirement for Jews to be happy on Sukkot. The Talmud writes that this requirement lasts for eight days—the seven days of Sukkot "and" Shemini Atzeret. As part of this, Hallel is said in synagogue during the morning prayers of Shemini Atzeret.

In Israel, this is the only practice from Sukkot that continues into Shemini Atzeret. In every other way Shemini Atzeret is a separate holiday with separate practices.

Outside Israel, this is complicated by the Jewish law of adding an extra day to every Biblical Jewish holiday except Yom Kippur. The holiday of Sukkot, which lasts seven days in Israel lasts eight days outside Israel. But the eighth day is also the first day of the separate holiday of Shemini Atzeret. Sometimes the rules for the two holidays conflict. Figuring out the conflicts can be complicated. But the general rule is that 
In practice, what happens "only outside of Israel" is that
None of this happens on the second day of Shemini Atzeret (Simchat Torah), because it is no longer an extra day of Sukkot.

Richard III, Duke of Normandy

Richard III (997/1001 – 6 August 1027) was the Duke of Normandy. His short reign of one year opened with a rebellion by his younger brother Robert I and ended with his death.

Richard III was the oldest son of Richard II, Duke of Normandy and his wife Judith of Brittany. He was born . Around the year 1120, Richard's father sent him in command of a large army to rescue his brother-in-law, Reginald I, Count of Burgundy. It was a distance of about 250 miles (400 kilometers) from Normandy. Richard III's capture of the castle of Minamde was enough to convince Bishop Hugh to surrender and release Reginald.

When his father died in August of 1026, as the oldest son, Richard III succeeded him as Duke of Normandy. By all accounts Richard III was accepted by the barons of Normandy and had no problems accepting his new role as duke. Richard III had given his younger son, Robert, the town of Exmes and the county of Hiemois. But once Richard III became duke, his younger brother Robert was not satisfied. He raided the diocese of his uncle Robert II, Archbishop of Rouen. He also captured his brother's city of Falaise. Robert's rebellion lasted through the end of 1026 and into early 1027. Finally Richard III laid to Falaise and brought the walls down. Robert surrendered and promised to be faithful.

Richard III then took the next step; he arranged with king Robert II of France to marry his young daughter, Adelis. She was given rich dowry which included the city and county of Coutances. Even though he was now newly married to a king's daughter, he already had children by a concubine. But unexpectedly Richard III died on 5 or 6 August 1027. He had a son named Nicholas, but the boy was immediately sent to the at Fécamp. With Nicholas out of the way the duchy passed to his Richard III's younger brother Robert, who became the sixth duke of Normandy as Robert I.

In January of 1027 he was married to Adela a younger daughter of Robert II of France and Constance of Arles. After Richard's death Adela secondly married Baldwin V, Count of Flanders.

By his wife Adela he had no children.

By an unknown concubine he had at least two children:

Celestial coordinate system

A celestial coordinate system is a coordinate system that helps astronomers specify the location of objects in the sky. These objects may be stars, planets or even satellites. There are several such coordinate systems listed below. All of them are spherical.

The fundamental plane divides the celestial sphere into two equal hemispheres and defines the baseline for the latitudinal coordinates, similar to the equator in the geographic coordinate system. The poles are located at ±90° from the fundamental plane. The primary direction is the starting point of the longitudinal coordinates.

These are common coordinate systems used by the astronomical community:

The horizontal system is based on the position of the observer on Earth. It is a useful coordinate system for finding and tracking objects for observers on Earth. It is based on the position of stars relative to an observer's true or ideal horizon.

The equatorial coordinates are based on the position of stars relative to the Earth's equator. Imagine the Earth's equator extended out to an infinite distance. The equatorial describes the sky as seen from the solar system. "Modern star maps almost exclusively use equatorial coordinates".

The fundamental plane is the plane of the Earth's orbit, also called the ecliptic plane. There are two versions: the geocentric ecliptic coordinates centred on the Earth, and heliocentric ecliptic coordinates centred on the centre of mass of the solar system.

The geocentric ecliptic system was the principal coordinate system for ancient astronomy and is still useful for computing the apparent motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets.

The heliocentric ecliptic system describes the planets' orbital movement around the Sun, and centres on the barycenter of the solar system. This is very close to the centre of the Sun). The system is mainly used for computing the positions of planets and other solar system bodies, and their orbits.

The galactic coordinate system uses the approximate plane of our galaxy as its fundamental plane. The solar system is still the centre of the coordinate system, and the zero point is defined as the direction towards the galactic centre. 'Galactic latitude' means, roughly, the elevation above the galactic plane. 'Galactic longitude' is the direction relative to the centre of the galaxy.

The supergalactic coordinate system is a fundamental plane with a higher than average number of local galaxies in the sky as seen from Earth.

There is standard software which does the calculations:

Lateral line

The lateral line is a system of sense organs found in fish, and not in land vertebrates. It detects movement and vibration in the surrounding water. Modified epithelial cells, known as hair cells, respond to changes around the fish. These turn the changes into electrical impulses which go to their central nervous system. 

Lateral lines are used in schooling, predation, and orientation. For example, fish use their lateral line system to follow the vortices produced by fleeing prey. They are faint lines running lengthwise down each side, from the gill covers to the base of the tail. 

In some species, the receptive organs of the lateral line have been modified to function as electroreceptors, which are organs used to detect electrical impulses. Most amphibian larvae and some fully aquatic adult amphibians have systems which work a bit like the lateral line.

Spherical coordinate system

A spherical coordinate system uses three numbers to identify a point in space.: Usually, two angles, and a distance from the origin of the coordinate system. If the point lies on the sphere, only the two angles are needed, because the distance from the origin is known.

Earth's longitude is the same as the variable phi, which can be written as either formula_1 or formula_2 The latitude resembles the variable formula_3 (theta), except that some authors define formula_4 to be at the north pole instead of at the equator.

Robert I, Duke of Normandy

Robert the Magnificent () (22 June 1000 - 1/3 July 1035), was the sixth Duke of Normandy from 1027 until he died returning from a pilgrimage. Robert's reign was a period in the history of Normandy. He was the father of William the Conqueror, who in 1066 became King of England.

Robert was the second son of Richard II of Normandy and Judith. He was probably born between 1005 and 1010.
Their father had decided that the older son, Richard III, would succeed him as duke. Robert would became Count of Hiémois. In August 1026 their father, Richard II, died and Richard III became the fifth duke. But once Richard III began to reign, Robert was not satisfied with his position. He raided the diocese of his uncle Robert II, Archbishop of Rouen. He also captured his brother's city of Falaise. Robert's rebellion lasted through the end of 1026 and into early 1027. Finally Richard III laid to Falaise and brought the walls down. Robert surrendered and promised his .

When Richard III died shortly after Robert's surrender, there were suspicions that Robert might have caused his brother's death. Robert was accepted, however, as the sixth duke following his brother. But the Robert I had started against his brother Richard III didn't stop when the two made peace. There were still many feuds which had started between neighboring barons. These continued in Normandy during much of Robert’s reign. It was also during this time that many of the lesser left Normandy to seek their fortunes in southern Italy and elsewhere. Soon after he became duke and possibly in revenge for supporting his brother, Robert I gathered an army and began raiding the lands of his uncle, Robert II, Archbishop of Rouen. Only a brief allowed his uncle to leave Normandy in exile. The Archbishop then placed an of on Robert and all of Normandy. The edict was only removed when Archbishop Robert was allowed to return and all his lands were restored. Robert also attacked another powerful church leader, his cousin Hugo d'Ivry, Bishop of Bayeux. Robert banished him from Normandy. Robert also seized a number of church properties belonging to the abbey of Fécamp.

In spite of all his troubles in Normandy Robert decided to get involved in the civil war in Flanders. This feud was between Baldwin V, Count of Flanders and his father Baldwin IV who the younger Baldwin had driven out of Flanders. Baldwin V, supported by king Robert II of France, his , was persuaded to make peace with his father in 1030. This happened only after Duke Robert promised the elder Baldwin his military support.

Robert gave shelter to Henry I of France against his mother, Queen Constance. The queen wanted her younger son Robert to succeed his father Robert II as king of France. For his help Henry I gave Robert the French Vexin. In the early 1030s Alan III, Duke of Brittany began to expand from the area of Rennes and appeared to have wanted the area around Mont Saint-Michel After raiding Dol and stopping Alan's attempts to raid Avranches, Robert mounted a major campaign against his cousin Alan III. However, Alan appealed to Archbishop Robert of Rouen (they were both his nephews). The Archbishop arranged a peace between Duke Robert and his vassal Alan III.

Robert's cousins, the Athelings Edward and Alfred, had been living in exile at the Norman Court. They were the sons of his aunt Emma of Normandy and Athelred, King of England. At some point Robert attempted an invasion of England on their behalf but was stopped by unfavorable winds. The king of England, Cnut the Great sent envoys to Duke Robert offering to settle half the Kingdom of England on Edward and Alfred. After postponing the invasion he chose to also postpone the decision until after he returned from Jerusalem.

Robert's attitude towards the Church changed completely since his uncle's return from exile. To make up for what he had done to the Church earlier he restored all the property that he or his vassals had taken. He also decided to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to make up for his sins. After making his illegitimate son William his heir, he set out on his pilgrimage. He travelled by way of Constantinople and reached Jerusalem.

List of French departments by population

This table lists the 101 departments of France in descending order of population, area and population density.

Between 1999 and 2006 all French departments have grown in population with the exception of the following seven departments: Allier and Cantal in Auvergne, Creuse in Limousin, Ardennes and Haute-Marne in Champagne-Ardenne, Nièvre in Burgundy, and Vosges in Lorraine.

In contrast the seven departments that have gained the most population in absolute value are Haute-Garonne, Gironde, Bouches-du-Rhône, Seine-Saint-Denis, Loire-Atlantique, Hauts-de Seine, and Hérault.

Guadeloupe has seemingly lost population between 1999 and 2008. However, this diminution of the legal population is due to the creation of the overseas communities of Saint Barthélemy and Saint-Martin.

Ponthieu

Ponthieu is a former province in northern France. Its chief town is Abbeville. It lies centered on the mouth of the Somme River. It includes the townships of Crecy-en-Ponthieu, Nouvion-en-Ponthieu and Ailly-le-Haut-Bell.

Ponthieu played a small role in the events that led up to the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Harold Godwinson of England was blown ashore at Ponthieu in 1064. He was taken captive by the men of Guy I and held for ransom at the castle of Beaurain. Thinking Harold might be useful to him William II, Duke of Normandy, secured his release. William escorted him to Rouen and gave him many gifts. 
william then had Harold take 'many oaths' to support his claim to the English throne and to become William's vassal. But a year after Harold's return to England when king Edward the Confessor died, Harold quickly forgot his oaths and took the crown for himself. That same year Harold was killed at Battle of Hastings and William became King of England.

In 1067 the chaplain of Matilda of Flanders, Guy, Bishop of Amiens, composed Carmen de Hastingae Proelio, a Latin poem on the battle of Hastings.

In 1150 the Count of Ponthieu built a fortress for himself at Crotoy, a strategic point on the mouth of the river Somme.

During the Hundred Years' War, Ponthieu a number of times. The English claimed control of it from 1279–1369 and again until 1435. During English control of Ponthieu, Abbeville was used as the capital.

In late August 1346 Edward III of England reached the region of Ponthieu. While he was there rebuilt the fortress at Crotoy. He forced a passage of the Somme at the ford of Blanchetaque. The army led by Philip VI of France caught up with him at nearby Crécy-en-Ponthieu, leading to the famous Battle of Crécy.

In 1360, the Treaty of Bretigny between King John II of France and Edward III of England gave control of Ponthieu (along with Gascony and Calais) over to the English, in exchange for Edward relinquishing his claim to the French throne. Edward took the land but still refused to surrender his claim.

In April, 1369 Charles V of France conquered Ponthieu. A month later he declared war on England. As a result, Edward publicly reassumed the title 'King of France' in June.

In 1372 an English army under the leadership of Robert Knolles invaded Ponthieu. They burned the city of Le Crotoy before crossing the Somme at the ford of Blanchetaque.

In the Treaty of Arras (1435), Charles VII of France convinced Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, to break his alliance with the English. In exchange he gave him Ponthieu. This marked a turning point that led to the end of England's part in the conflict 40 years later.

In 1477 Ponthieu was reconquered by King Louis XI of France.

In World War I between 1 July and 18 November 1916 the Battle of the Somme was fought in Ponthieu. It was one of the most costly battles ever fought with over 1,000,000 men killed or wounded.

Abbeville

Abbeville is a commune in the Somme department in Hauts-de-France in northern France.

Abbeville is on the Somme River, from its modern mouth in the English Channel. Most of the town is on the east bank of the Somme, as well as on an island. It is at the start of the Abbeville Canal, and is northwest of Amiens. In the medieval period, it was the lowest crossing point on the Somme. Edward III's army crossed nearby shortly before the Battle of Crécy in 1346.

Abbeville was the capital of the former province of France of Ponthieu. Today, it is one of the three s of the Somme department.

The Romans occupied it and named it "Abbatis Villa".

The name Abbeville has been adopted to name a category of paleolithic stone tools. These stone tools are also known as handaxes. Various handaxes were found near Abbeville by Jacques Boucher de Perthes during the 1830s. He was the first to describe the stones in detail. He pointed out in the first publication of its kind, that the stones were chipped deliberately by early man, so as to form a tool. These stone tools which are some of the earliest found in Europe, were chipped on both sides so as to form a sharp edge, were known as 'Abbevillian' handaxes or bifaces, but recently the term 'abevillian' is becoming obsolete as the earlier form of stone tool, not found in Europe, is known as the Oldowan chopper. Some of these are displayed at the museum Boucher-de-Perthes.

A more refined form from a later period of handaxe production was found in the Abbeville/Somme River district. The more refined handaxe became known as the Acheulean industry, named after Saint-Acheul, today a suburb of Amiens. It retained some importance into the Bronze Age.

Abbeville during the ninth century was part of the diocese of Saint-Riquier. It was also an important fortress responsible for the defense of the Somme. Abbeville had a charter granted to it in 1184. Afterwards it was governed by the Counts of Ponthieu. Together with that county, it came into the possession of the Alençon and other French families. Afterwards it came into the possession of the House of Castile. By marriage it passed in 1272 to King Edward I of England. In 1435, by the treaty of Arras, it was to the Duke of Burgundy. In 1477 it was taken control of by King Louis XI of France. Later it was held by two illegitimate branches of the royal family in the 16th and 17th centuries, being in 1696 returned to the crown. In 1514, the town was the place where the marriage of Louis XII of France to Mary Tudor took place. She was the daughter of Henry VII of England. In 1685, it suffered a serious economic when the Edict of Nantes was repealed. The Protestants who were the majority of the skilled labor, left town. The town never fully recovered from the loss of their talents.

Abbeville was fairly important in the 18th century. Van Robais Royal Manufacture (one of the first major factories in France) brought great prosperity to the town. Voltaire, among others, wrote about it.

Abbeville was the birthplace of Rear Admiral Amédée Courbet (1827–85). His victories on land and at sea made him a national hero during the Sino-French War (August 1884 to April 1885). Courbet died in June 1885 in the Pescadores Islands. His body was brought back to France and buried in Abbeville on 1 September 1885 after a state funeral. Abbeville's old Haymarket Square (Place du Marché-au-Blé) was renamed Place de l'Amiral Courbet in July 1885. This was shortly after the news of Courbet's death reached France. A statue of Courbet was erected in the middle of the square at the end of the nineteenth century. The statue was damaged in a bombing raid during World War II.

On 12 September 1939 in Abbeville a conference took place. There France and the United Kingdom decided it was too late to send troops to help Poland in its fight against Germany. By this time Poland was already on the verge of defeat. After five years—in September 1944—Abbeville was liberated by the Polish First Armoured Division under General Maczek.

In 1940, the Germans with the bulk of their armoured force in Panzer Group von Kleist achieved a breakthrough at Sedan with air support. The Panzer group raced to the coast of the English Channel at Abbeville. This isolated (20 May 1940) the British Expeditionary Force, Belgian Army, and some divisions of the French Army in northern France. The Battle of France was lost by the Allies.

Charles de Gaulle (17–18 May 1940), as a Colonel in this period, launched a in the region of Laon (see the map). He had 80 tanks to destroy the communication of the German armoured troops. His newly formed 4e Division cuirassée reached Montcornet, resulting in the Battle of Montcornet. But, without support, the 4th DCR was forced to retreat. There was another counterattack with the Battle of Abbeville. After Laon (24 May), de Gaulle was promoted to temporary general: "On 28 May (...) the 4th DCR attacked twice to destroy a pocket captured by the enemy south of the Somme near Abbeville. The operation was successful, with over 400 prisoners taken and the entire pocket mopped up except for Abbeville (...) but in the second attack the 4th DCR failed to gain control of the city in the face of superior enemy numbers." WWII was not kind to the buildings of the town as the famous 17th century Gothic Cathedral of St. Vulfran was nearly destroyed.

Abbeville manufactures ; in particular, linens and tablecloths. It also has factories and spinning mills. Finally, it also makes locks and produces sugar.

The city was very picturesque until the early days of the World War II. It was bombed mostly to rubble in one night by the Germans. The town overall is now mostly modern and rebuilt. Several of the town's attractions remain, including:

Abbeville is served by trains on the line between Boulogne-sur-Mer and Amiens. Abbeville was the southern terminus of the Réseau des Bains de Mer, the line to Dompierre-sur-Authie opened on 19 June 1892 and closed on 10 March 1947.

Insulator (electricity)

An electrical insulator is a material that does not easily allow flow of electricity through an electric current. Materials typically used to insulate include rubber, plastic and glass. In transformers and electric motors, varnish is used. Insulating gases such as Sulfur hexafluoride are used in some switches. Wires that carry electric currents are usually insulated so the electricity goes to the right place.

Insulator can mean not only the material but things that are made of that material. They are made of various materials such as: glass, silicone, rubber, plastic, oil, wood, dry cotton, quartz, ceramic, etc. 

The type of insulator will depend on the uses. Insulators have high electrical resistivity and low conductivity. The insulators prevent the loss of current and make the current more efficient by concentrating the flow. 

Electric power transmission uses three types of overhead insulator: pin insulator, suspension insulator, and strain insulator.

Charles the Simple

Charles III (17 September 879 – 7 October 929), called the Simple or the Straightforward (from the Latin "Carolus Simplex"), was the King of the Franks from 898 until 922 and the King of Lotharingia from 911 until 919–23. He was a member of the Carolingian dynasty.

Charles was the third and posthumous son of Louis the Stammerer by his second wife, Adelaide of Paris. As a child, Charles was not allowed to become king in 884 when his half-brother Carloman died. The Frankish nobles instead asked his cousin, Charles the Fat, to rule over them. King Charles the Fat was not a good king so he was removed (deposed) in November 887. He died soon after in January 888. The nobility elected Odo, the hero of the Siege of Paris as their king. Charles Simplex was put under the protection of Ranulf II of Aquitaine who used the royal title himself until making peace with Odo.

The talks were led by Hervé, the Archbishop of Reims. This resulted in the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, which granted Rollo and his soldiers all the land between the river Epte and the sea. It also granted him Brittany, "for his livelihood". At the time, Brittany was an independent land which France had not been able to conquer. In exchange, Rollo promised the king his loyalty and military assistance when needed. Also Rollo also agreed to be baptised and to marry Gisela, the king's daughter. The territory given Rollo is about the same as Upper Normandy. This would grow to become Normandy under Rollo's descendants. 

Also in 911, Louis the Child, the King of Germany, died. The nobles of Lotharingia made Charles their new king even though some had elected Conrad of Franconia king. Charles had tried to win their support for years. In April 907 he married a Lotharingian noblewoman named Frederuna. He also defended Lotharingia twice against attacks by Conrad, King of the Germans. Queen Frederuna died on 10 February 917 leaving six daughters and no sons. so Charles did not have an heir. On 7 October 919 Charles married again to Eadgifu of Wessex (England). She was the daughter of Edward the Elder, King of England. She bore him his only son, the future King Louis IV of France. 

Charles' had a favorite at court, a man named Hagano. This turned his nobles against Charles. He gave Hagano several monasteries that already belonged to other barons which angered them. Charles also turned the new duke, Gilbert against him. He turned his support to the German king Henry the Fowler in 919. Not everyone in Lotharingia was against Charles; he kept the support of Wigeric.

Finally the nobles seized Charles in 920. They were tired of Charles' policies and his favoritism of count Hagano. 
But after negotiations by Archbishop Herveus of Reims the king was released.
In 922 the Frankish nobles revolted again led by Robert of Neustria. Robert was Odo's brother and was elected king by the rebels. Charles had to flee to Lotharingia. On 2 July 922, Charles lost his most faithful supporter, Herveus of Reims. Charles returned with a Norman army in 923 but was defeated on 15 June near Soissons by Robert, who died in the battle. Charles was captured and in a castle at Péronne under the guard of Herbert II of Vermandois. Charles' English wife Eadgifu and their son Louis fled to England. Robert's Rudolph of Burgundy was elected to succeed him. In 925 the Lotharingia became part of the Kingdom of Germany. Charles died in prison on 7 October 929 and was buried at the nearby abbey of Saint-Fursy. His only son by Eadgifu would later be crowned in 936 as Louis IV of France.

Charles married first, in May 907, Frederuna, daughter of Dietrich, Count in the Hamaland. Together they had six daughters:

In 919 Charles married secondly Eadgifu of Wessex. Together they had:

Robert Curthose

Robert Curthose (–1134), sometimes styled Robert II or Robert III, was the Duke of Normandy from 1087 until 1106. He was also Count of Maine. His reign as Duke is noted for the conflicts he had with his brothers in England. This led to the dukedom of Normandy being reunited with crown of England.

Robert was the eldest son of William the Conqueror, the first Norman king of England, and Matilda of Flanders. Robert was born . As a child he was to Margaret, the heiress of Maine. But she died before they could be wed. Robert didn't marry until he was in his late forties.

Robert was brought up among William's . As a result, he became a skilled warrior. But unlike his father he expected to live a life of pleasure and luxury. In 1063, his father made him the count of Maine when he was contracted to marry Margaret. But Robert had no authority. The county was actually run by his father until 1069 when the county revolted and reverted to Hugh V of Maine. Still, he had been made his father's heir. Twice the barons had taken an oath of fealty to him as their future leader.

In 1077 Robert got into an argument with his father. He demanded to rule Normandy which he had on at least on occasion while William was in England. William was not able to reason with his son and Robert left angry. The next day Robert and his followers attempted to seize Rouen. The siege failed. After rebelling against his father all he could do was go into exile. 
Robert first went to Chateauneuf-en-Thymerais. He then fled to Flanders to the court of his uncle Robert I, Count of Flanders. 

In the spring of 1080 Robert was back on good terms with his father. He again made Robert his heir for Normandy in the presences of his barons. Later that summer or early fall Robert went with his father to England. William placed Robert in charge of a large army to march north and deal with King Malcolm III of Scotland. Malcolm had been raiding the north of England while William was occupied in Normandy. When the two armies drew near each other, Malcolm did not want to fight. He again swore fealty to king William and gave hostages. Robert remained in England with his father until the end of 1081. Events in Maine caused William and Robert to return to Normandy. Fulk IV, Count of Anjou had been attacking in Maine again trying to get control away from Normandy. William and Robert led a great army into Maine to confront the Angevin count. Before the fighting could start, a cardinal and several monks stopped the battle. They called for a truce and after much negotiation one was agreed to. The count of Anjou was to let Normandy have Maine, but Robert, as count of Maine, had to recognize Fulk IV as his overlord for Maine. When Queen Matilda died in 1083 Robert seemed to abandon his father. He and his mother had been very close. 

In 1087, the Conqueror died of wounds suffered from a riding accident during a siege of Mantes. At his death he reportedly wanted to disinherit his eldest son but was persuaded to divide the Norman dominions between his two eldest sons. To Robert he granted the Duchy of Normandy and to William Rufus he granted the Kingdom of England. The youngest son Henry was given money to buy land. Of the two elder sons Robert was considered to be much the weaker and was generally preferred by the nobles who held lands on both sides of the English Channel since they could more easily circumvent his authority. At the time of their father's death the two brothers made an agreement to be each other's heir. However this peace lasted less than a year when barons joined with Robert to displace Rufus in the Rebellion of 1088. It was not a success, in part because Robert never showed up to support the English rebels.

Robert took as his close adviser Ranulf Flambard, who had been previously a close adviser to his father. Flambard later became an astute but much-disliked financial adviser to William Rufus until the latter's death in 1100.

In 1096, Robert left for the Holy Land on the First Crusade. At the time of his departure he was reportedly so poor that he often had to stay in bed for lack of clothes. In order to raise money for the crusade he mortgaged his duchy to his brother William for the sum of 10,000 marks.

When William II died on 2 August 1100, Robert was on his return journey from the Crusade and was about to marry a wealthy young bride to raise funds to buy back his duchy. As a result, his brother Henry was able to seize the crown of England for himself. Upon his return, Robert – urged by Flambard and several Anglo-Norman barons – claimed the English crown on the basis of the short-lived agreement of 1087. In 1101, he led an invasion to oust his brother Henry; he landed at Portsmouth with his army but his lack of popular support among the English as well as Robert's own mishandling of the invasion tactics enabled Henry to resist the invasion. Robert was forced by diplomacy to renounce his claim to the English throne in the Treaty of Alton. It is said that Robert was a brilliant field commander but a terrible general in the First Crusade. His government (or misgovernment) of Normandy as well as his failed invasion of England suggests that his military skills were little better than his political skills.

In 1105, however, Robert's continual stirring of discord with his brother in England as well as civil disorder in Normandy itself prompted Henry to invade Normandy. Orderic reports on an incident at Easter 1105 when Robert was supposed to hear a sermon by the venerable Serlo, Bishop of Sées. Robert spent the night before sporting with harlots and jesters and while he lay in bed sleeping off his drunkenness his unworthy friends stole his clothes. He awoke to find himself naked and had to remain in bed and missed the sermon.

In 1106, Henry defeated Robert's army decisively at the Battle of Tinchebray and claimed Normandy as a possession of the English crown, a situation that endured for almost a century. Captured after the battle, Robert was imprisoned in Devizes Castle for twenty years before being moved to Cardiff.

In 1134, Robert died in Cardiff Castle in his early eighties. Robert Curthose, sometime Duke of Normandy, eldest son of the Conqueror, was buried in the abbey church of St. Peter in Gloucester. The exact place of his burial is difficult to establish – legend states that he requested to be buried before the High Altar. His effigy carved in bog oak, however, lies on a mortuary chest decorated with the attributed arms of the Nine Worthies (missing one – Joshua, and replaced with the arms of Edward the Confessor). The effigy dates from about 100 years after his death and the mortuary chest much later. The church subsequently has become Gloucester Cathedral.

Robert married Sybilla of Conversano, daughter of Geoffrey of Brindisi, Count of Conversano (and a grandniece of Robert Guiscard, another Norman duke) on the way back from Crusade, one child:


Robert also had at least three illegitimate children:

October (album)

October is the second album by Irish rock band U2. It was released on 12 October 1981. The album is about spirituality. It got mixed reviews and it was not played much by radio stations.

After touring for Boy, U2 began to write new songs. The band started recording in the studio in July 1981. Then Bono lost his notebook with the lyrics after a show in Portland, Oregon. He had to make up the words to songs as he was singing on the microphone. His lost notebook was returned many years later, in 2004. Bono said its return was "an act of grace".

When it was released, "October" got more mixed reviews than their first album, "Boy".

Dave McCullough of "Sounds" magazine praised the album. He said: "A kind of zenith pop then, no half measures. It all breathes fire... 'Gloria' being possibly Their Finest Moment and 'Tomorrow', low and muted, gently oozing emotion". McCullough also said, "This "October" will last forever".

Adam Sweeting of "Melody Maker" also gave a good review. He said: "Their whole musical sensibility is shaped by a strong emotional bond to their homeland and its traditions. It gives them a completely different frame of reference from most groups...

But, "NME" gave a negative review. Barney Hoskyns talked about the "excessive plaintiveness of Bono's voice and the forced power of U2's sound". He also said: "Obviously rock doesn't expire just because groups run out of ways to change it... U2, I guess, will continue to 'move' in live performance, but they will only move on the lightest surface. Their music does 'soar'... But then 'God' knows, there are other religions".

All of the songs were written by U2, and all of the lyrics were written by Bono.

The Battle of Shiloh was a battle in the American Civil War. It was fought on April 6 and April 7, 1862, in Tennessee. It was one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War.

The Union Army of the Tennessee was commanded by Ulysses S. Grant. Grant had captured Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in western Tennessee during the early months of 1862. This forced the Confederate Army to leave Kentucky, western Tennessee, and central Tennessee.

Grant wanted to capture the city of Corinth, Mississippi, next. But his superior, Henry W. Halleck, didn't want Grant to go any further south until other Union soldiers joined him. So Grant moved his army to a place called Pittsburg Landing, which was on the Tennessee River. There was a church near the landing called Shiloh Church. His army stayed there for several weeks.

General Albert Sidney Johnston commanded the Confederates. Johnston's second-in-command was P. G. T. Beauregard. Beauregard came up with a plan to recapture western Tennessee. Confederate soldiers from all over the Western theater gathered in Corinth. Then, starting on April 3rd, they marched north toward Grant's army. The Confederate Army was ready to attack on the morning of the 6th.

The battle started around dawn on April 6th. The Confederates surprised the Union Army. After fighting all day, Grant's army retreated back to Pittsburg Landing. Johnston was killed during the battle, and Beauregard took over the Confederate Army.

More Union soldiers arrived at the battlefield during the night. They were part of the Army of the Ohio, commanded by Don Carlos Buell.

Grant attacked the Confederates the next morning. The two armies fought all morning and during the afternoon. By 4 p.m., Beauregard decided to retreat back to Corinth.

The Confederates lost 10,698 casualties during the battle. Union soldiers buried the Confederate dead on the battlefield. The Union Army lost about 14,500 casualties during the battle.

Russian human rights activist and dissident Lyudmila Alexeyeva explained glasnost as a word that "had been in the Russian language for centuries. It was in the dictionaries and lawbooks as long as there had been dictionaries and lawbooks. It was an ordinary, hardworking, nondescript word that was used to refer to a process, any process of justice of governance, being conducted in the open".

Glasnost can also refer to the specific period in the history of the USSR during the 1980s when there was less censorship and greater freedom of information.

Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte

The Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte was signed in the autumn of 911. It was a treaty between Charles the Simple and Rollo, one of the leaders of the Vikings living in Neustria. It was to protect Charles' kingdom from any new invasion by the "Northmen. In 911, a group of Vikings lead by Rollo Paris and Chartres. After a victory near Chartres on 26 August, Charles decided to try to reach an agreement with Rollo. The talks were led by Hervé, the Archbishop of Reims. The result was the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte. The treaty granted Rollo all land between the river Epte and the sea in exchange for his fealty. In addition, the treaty granted Rollo Brittany "for his ". At the time, Brittany was an independent region which France had not been able to control. In exchange, Rollo promised the king his loyalty, which involved military assistance for the protection of the kingdom. As a token of his good will, Rollo also agreed to be baptised and marry Gisela a daughter of king Charles.

The territory covered by the treaty is nearly the same as today’s Upper Normandy down to the Seine river. It would later extend west beyond the Seine to form the Duchy of Normandy, named for the northmen who ruled it. The treaty was entered into after the death of Alan I, King of Brittany and at the time another group of Vikings occupied Brittany. Around 937 Alan I's son, Alan II returned from England to expel those Vikings from Brittany. This happened in 939. During this period the Cotentin Peninsula was lost by Brittany and gained by Normandy.

The Norman Vexin became a part of Normandy while the French Vexin remained a part of the Île-de-France. A series of castles were built on both banks of the Epte to guard this frontier. 

Claude Monet lived at Giverny near the river for more than forty years. In his garden, by diverting a branch of the Epte, he established a water garden with its famous water-lily pond and a Japanese-style bridge.

Amazing Alex

Amazing Alex, which is developed by Rovio Entertainment, is a puzzle game.

In Google Play, this game is rated as 4.3 out of 5 stars.

In Pocket Gamer, Harry Slater, a player of this game, prefers "Angry Birds" to "Amazing Alex". He said, "That's not to say that Amazing Alex isn't an addictive experience - it's just that compared to Angry Birds, there's less excitement involved. You rarely feel like throwing your arms in the air when you've completed a puzzle, for example, and the absence of any kind of antagonist reduces the stakes slightly."

William Clito

William "Clito" (1102–1128), was the Count of Flanders and Duke of Normandy. His "Clito" was a Latin term meaning the same as the Anglo-Saxon """". Both ""Clito"" and ""Atheling"" signified a "man of royal blood", or the modern term "prince".

William was the son of Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, and his wife Sybilla of Conversano. She was the daughter of Geoffrey, Count of Conversano (in southern Italy). His father, the Duke of Normandy was defeated and captured by his brother Henry I of England at the Battle of Tinchebrai in (1106). Robert Curthose went with Henry I to Falaise where Henry met his nephew the young William Clito for the first time. Henry placed his nephew in the custody of Helias of Saint Saens, Count of Arques. Helias had married a daughter of Duke Robert, his friend and lord. The boy William stayed under the care of Helias until August 1110. At that time the king suddenly sent agents to demand the boy be handed over to him. At the time Helias was away from home. But his servants hid the boy and smuggled him to their master. Helias fled to safety among Henry's enemies.

William’s first refuge was with King Henry’s great enemy, Robert de Bellême, who had extensive lands south of Normandy. When Robert of Bellême was captured in 1112, William and Helias fled to the court of the young Count Baldwin VII of Flanders who was another of William’s cousins. In 1118 a number of Norman counts and barons were tired enough of King Henry to ally with Count Baldwin. They took up William Clito’s cause and started a dangerous rebellion.

The Norman border counts and Count Baldwin were too powerful for the king to fight. They seized much of the north part of Normandy. But the campaign quickly ended when count Baldwin was injured at the siege of Arques (September 1118). The next year the cause of William Clito was taken up by Louis VI of France. He invaded Normandy down the river Seine. On 20 August 1119 the French king was met by the troops of King Henry at the Battle of Brémule. Louis and his army were defeated. 

William Clito was riding as a knight with the French king’s guard that day. He narrowly escaped capture when the French lost the battle. The next day his cousin, King Henry’s son, William Adelin, sent him back the horse he had lost in the battle with other "necessities" as a matter of chivalry. The rebellion collapsed, but the French king continued to support him. Louis brought his case to the pope’s attention in October 1119 at Reims, and forced Henry I to give reasons for his harsh treatment of the exiled boy.

On 25 November 1120 tragedy struck Henry I of England. His son, William Adelin was among the nobles who drowned when the White ship sunk in the English Channel. The loss of King Henry’s only legitimate son, changed William Clito’s fortunes. He was now the obvious male heir to England and Normandy. A significant party of Norman nobles took up his cause. Henry's problems became worse. His his son William Adelin had been promised in marriage to Matilda of Anjou, the daughter of Count Fulk V of Anjou. Fulk now wanted her dowry, including several castles and towns in Maine, returned. But Henry flatly refused. Fulk then promised his daughter Sibylla to William Clito, giving him the county of Maine as her dowry. King Henry then appealed to canon (Church) law and the marriage was eventually (not legal) in August 1124. The William and Sibylla were too closely related under Church laws of the time to be married.

In the meantime, a serious rebellion broke out in Normandy in favour of William Clito. But this was defeated by Henry’s spy network. There was also very little organization among the leaders. They were defeated at the battle of Bourgtheroulde in March 1124. Henry I also got his son-in-law, the Emperor Henry V, to threaten Louis from the east. This kept king Louis VI distracted so he could not offer help.

In 1127, Louis VI was able to make great efforts to help William’s cause. In January he gave him the royal lands in the French Vexin as a base to attack down the Seine into Normandy. Also he married the French queen’s Joanna of Montferrat. The murder of Count Charles the Good of Flanders on 2 March 1127 gave King Louis a good chance to further William’s fortunes. The king marched into Flanders at the head of an army and on 30 March got the barons of the province to accept William as their new count.

William started out very well as count. By the end of May he had most of the county cooperating with him. But English money and a new rival, Thierry of Alsace, led to a weakening of his position. In February 1128 Saint-Omer and Ghent said they would no longer accept him as their count. Bruges did the same in March. In May 1128 Lille too welcomed Thierry. This left William controlling little more than the southern fringe of Flanders. However, he struck back at Bruges. In the battle of Axspoele south of the town on 21 June, William with his Norman knights and French allies defeated Thierry. 

At this point William was joined by his , Duke Godfrey of Brabant. Together their armies besieged Aalst on 12 July. But during the course of the siege William was wounded in the arm in a scuffle with a foot soldier. The wound became and William died at the age of twenty-five on 28 July 1128. His faithful , Helias of Saint Saens, was there with him. William’s body was carried to the abbey of St Bertin in St Omer and buried there. He left no children and was survived by his father, a prisoner of Henry I, who died six years later.

Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou

Geoffrey V (1113–1151), called the Handsome () and Plantagenet (), was the Count of Anjou, Touraine, and Maine from 1129. He was the Duke of Normandy from 1144. By his marriage to the Empress Matilda, daughter and heiress of Henry I of England, Geoffrey had a son, Henry Curtmantle, who succeeded to the English throne. Geoffrey was the founder of the House of Plantagenet, so named for his nickname.

Geoffrey was the elder son of Fulk V, King of Jerusalem and his wife Ermengarde of Maine. She was the daughter of Elias I of Maine. Geoffrey, born 24 August 1113, was named after his great-grandfather Geoffrey II, Count of Gâtinais. He received his nickname, Plantagenet, from the yellow sprig of broom blossom ("genêt" is the French name for the "planta genista", or broom shrub) he wore in his hat. King Henry I of England sent his royal to Anjou to arrange a marriage between Geoffrey and his daughter, Matilda. Consent was given by both parties. On 10 June 1128 King Henry I knighted the fifteen-year-old Geoffrey.

In 1128 Geoffrey married Empress Matilda, the daughter and heiress of King Henry I of England and widow of Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor. The marriage was meant to seal a peace between England/Normandy and Anjou. She was about eleven years older than Geoffrey, and very proud of her status as an Empress (as opposed to being a mere Countess). Their marriage was a stormy one with frequent long separations, but she bore him three sons and survived him.

The year after the marriage Geoffrey's father left for Jerusalem to marry the heiress of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Geoffrey became the sole count of Anjou. When King Henry I died in 1135, Matilda at once entered Normandy to claim her inheritance. The border districts submitted to her, but England chose her cousin Stephen of Blois for its king, and Normandy soon followed suit. The following year, Geoffrey gave Ambrieres, Gorron, and Chatilon-sur-Colmont to Juhel de Mayenne, on condition that he help obtain the inheritance of Geoffrey's wife. In 1139 Matilda landed in England with 140 knights, where she was besieged at Arundel Castle by King Stephen. In the "Anarchy" which ensued, Stephen was captured at Lincoln in February, 1141, and imprisoned at Bristol. A legatine council of the English church held at Winchester in April 1141 declared Stephen deposed and proclaimed Matilda "Lady of the English". Stephen was subsequently released from prison and had himself recrowned on the anniversary of his first coronation.

During 1142 and 1143, Geoffrey secured all of Normandy west and south of the Seine, and, on 14 January 1144, he crossed the Seine and entered Rouen. He assumed the title of Duke of Normandy in the summer of 1144. In 1144, he founded an Augustine priory at Chateau-l'Ermitage in Anjou. Geoffrey held the duchy until 1149, when he and Matilda conjointly ceded it to their son, Henry, which cession was formally ratified by King Louis VII of France the following year.

Geoffrey also put down three baronial rebellions in Anjou, in 1129, 1135, and 1145–1151. He was often at odds with his younger brother, Elias, whom he had imprisoned until 1151. The threat of rebellion slowed his progress in Normandy, and is one reason he could not intervene in England. In 1153, the Treaty of Wallingford allowed Stephen should remain King of England for life and that Henry, the son of Geoffrey and Matilda should succeed him.

Geoffrey died suddenly on 7 September 1151. According to John of Marmoutier, Geoffrey was returning from a royal council when he was stricken with fever. He arrived at Château-du-Loir, collapsed on a couch, made bequests of gifts and charities, and died. He was buried at St. Julien's Cathedral in Le Mans France.

Geoffrey and Matilda's children were:

Geoffrey also had illegitimate children by an unknown mistress (or mistresses): Hamelin; Emme, who married Dafydd Ab Owain Gwynedd, Prince of North Wales; and Mary, who became a nun and Abbess of Shaftesbury and who may be the poetess Marie de France. Adelaide of Angers is sometimes sourced as being the mother of Hamelin.

William Adelin (1103–1120), sometimes Atheling , was the Duke of Normandy and heir apparent to the crown of England.

Henry of Huntingdon said of young William that he was full of pride and was arrogant. The historian William of Malmesbury quotes him as saying of the English: "if he came to reign over them, he would make them draw the plough like oxen." Henry arranged a marriage for his young son to Matilda of Anjou. She was the eldest daughter of Count Fulk V of Anjou in February 1113 near Alençon. But Fulk agreed to this without the permission of the king of France.

During king Henry I's lifetime William was invested by Henry as Duke of Normandy. But this was a title he held more in name than practice. Henry made William the duke when he was pressed by the king of France, Louis VI, to pledge his fealty. Henry as a king himself thought this was beneath him so in 1115 he offered to have William do this in his place. The offer was at first refused. But, later after a period of war Louis accepted him. William did homage to Louis VI in the middle of 1120. 

William's mother Queen Matilda served as Henry's in England while he was away in Normandy. After her death in 1118 William was old enough to serve as regent which he did for a year. It is clear that a group of Henry's advisors were there to help both Matilda and William.

In 1119, William and Matilda of Anjou married. The ceremony took place in June at the cathedral of Lisieux. The lordship of Maine was to be Matilda's dowry.

William died in the White Ship tragedy of 25 November 1120. The "White Ship" was a newer vessel and her captain was Thomas FitzStephen. He offered to let Henry I of England use it to return to England from Barfleur in Normandy. Henry had already arranged his passage but allowed his son William Adelin and many other nobles to use the White Ship. 
According to Orderic Vitalis William Adelin and his friends were drinking liberally and allowed the ship's crew to have drink also. By the time the ship was ready to leave there were about 300 people on board. Told to overtake the king's ship the captain set sail after dark. But the ship soon hit a rock in the harbor and quickly sank. William Adelin got into a small boat to escape but turned back to help his half-sister, Matilda, Countess of Perche. When others tried to climb into the boat it was swamped and sank. William and all of his companions died.

William's wife was on another ship at the time of the disaster, and survived him. Henry I kept her in England in hopes of marrying her to a nobleman. He wanted to control the county of Maine through her. But her father returned from Jerusalem a year later. He demanded she be returned to Anjou. But Henry refused. Eventually Henry sent her home. She returned to Anjou where she became a nun. Eventually she became Abbess of Fontevrault.

The sinking of the White ship was tremendous loss for Henry. His only son and heir was lost. Several of Henry's illegitimate children were lost as well. The remaining 300 who drowned were among the richest and best known of the nobility of the day. It was the worst maritime disaster of the Middle Ages. 

William Adelin's body was never found meaning there could be no funeral and no tomb. Henry's good fortune took a turn for the worse. Since William Adelin had died and his wife eventually returned to Anjou, Henry's alliance with her father was now cancelled. Henry quickly remarried to Adeliza, the daughter of Godfrey, Duke of Brabant. Although still a teenager she became a popular queen. Even so they never had any children so Henry's attempt to have a male heir to succeed him died with William Adelin.

Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist)

"This group should not be confused with the Australian Labor Party (Non-Communist), which was a name used by supporters of New South Wales Premier Jack Lang in the 1930s."

The Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist) (ALP-AC) was the name used by the right-wing group which split away from the Australian Labor Party in 1955. It later became the Democratic Labor Party in 1957.

In April 1955, seven Victorian federal MPs and eighteen state Members of Parliament were expelled from the ALP. They formed the ALP-AC under the influence of B. A. Santamaria. Only one state MP was elected at the next elections, while five Legislative Council members were not re-elected when their terms expired in 1958. The seven federal MPs were:


Frank McManus was elected to the Senate for Victoria and former ALP senator George Cole was re-elected to the Senate for Tasmania. Later Frank Scully gained the seat of Richmond in the Victorian Legislative Assembly in the May 1955 Victorian election.

The members of the ALP (Anti-Communist) were mostly Roman Catholic. There were only two non-Catholics, its federal leader, Bob Joshua, who represented Ballarat in the Australian House of Representatives, and Jack Little, who led the party in the Victoria Legislative Council between 1955 and 1958. It has been suggested that the party was mainly people of Irish background, and the ALP split of 1955 was the removal of the Irish-Catholics from the ALP. However, many ALP (Anti-Communist) members were not Irish. The party attracted many voters among migrants from Catholic countries in southern Europe, and among anti-Communist Eastern European refugees. In 1957, the party became the Democratic Labor Party, which closed in 1978.

Lavasoa dwarf lemur

The Lavasoa dwarf lemur ("Cheirogaleus lavasoensis") is a newly discovered primate. It is a small nocturnal species of lemur found on Madagascar. It lives in three small, isolated patches of forest on the southern slopes of the Lavasoa Mountains in southern Madagascar. Fewer than 50 individuals are thought to exist. Its habitat lies in a transitional zone between three ecoregions: dry spiny bush, humid littoral forest (near and in water), and humid forest. 

It was first collected in 2001, and was thought to be a subpopulation of the furry-eared dwarf lemur ("C. crossleyi"). It was not formally described until 2013. It is one of six species of dwarf lemur. The research also suggested the existence of other new species.

Anjou () is a former county, duchy (1360) and province centred on the city of Angers in the lower Loire Valley of western France. Its traditional Latin name was "Andegavia".

Anjou, or then the Angevin march (border lands) formed the border between Neustria and Aquitaine. It also bordered between Neustria and Brittany. Sitting on a black slate rock was the Roman of Angers. It guarded the rivers Mayenne and Loire that flowed around it.

The founder or first count of Anjou was Ingelger.

Anjou became a part of England from 1151-1199, when Henry II inherited the county. He became the Count of Anjou in addition to his other titles. His (third) son Richard the Lionheart became count after his father. At the peak of its power the Angevin Empire spread from Ulster to the Pyrenees. Richard had no legitimate issue, so in 1199 Anjou passed to his nephew, Arthur of Brittany. He was the son of Geoffrey, Duke of Brittany. The Crown of England passed to Henry II’s fifth son and Richard’s youngest brother, John. Arthur was taken prisoner by King John in 1203 and was never seen again. In 1204, Anjou was taken back by Philip II of France. It was later elevated to a duchy for Prince Louis, the second son of John II of France. It remained a duchy until the French Revolution. Today, Anjou corresponds largely to the present-day "département" of Maine-et-Loire.

Conscription was introduced on 24 January 1962. Conscription was for male citizens between the ages of 18 and 26. If they were selected, they had to serve in the NPA for 18 months. The NVA was at its largest in 1987. It had about 175,000 soldiers at this time.

The NVA was modeled on Soviet military philosophy. Its leadership and operations were governed by the officer corp. The non-commissioned officer corps was limited in terms of authority and responsibility, unlike in the West German army. There were also political officers throughout the NVA, whose job it was to guarantee the loyalty of the military to the ruling political party.

The NVA was made up of four main branches:

The NVA also had a large number of reserve and paramilitary forces. These could be called to serve during a crisis.

The NVA was merged into the Bundeswehr in October 1990 upon the reunification of Germany. The merging of the two German militaries was not done equally. Many non-commissioned officers and almost all commissioned officers were not accepted into the Bundeswehr. Instead, they were discharged from service. Those who were given a place in the Bundeswehr were usually demoted by one rank. Most of the barracks were closed and much of the NVA's equipment was sold or donated to other nations.

Linear independence

Linear independence is a concept from linear algebra. It is used to talk about vector spaces. Each vector space has a null vector. This vector is expressed as a linear combination (a sum) of other vectors. A set of these vectors is called "linearly independent" if and only if all of them are needed to express this null vector. This is equivalent to saying that at least one of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. If the vectors are not linearly independent, they are called "linearly dependent".

As an example, take the three-dimensional Euclidean space:
Here the first three vectors are linearly independent; but the fourth vector equals nine times the first plus five times the second plus four times the third, so the four vectors together are linearly dependent. Linear dependence is a property of the family, not of any particular vector; for example in this case we could just as well write the first vector as a linear combination of the last three.

Division of Blair

Ingelger married Adelis, a close relative of Raino, Bishop of Angers. He was succeeded by their son:


Tyndall effect

The Tyndall effect is when light is scattered by particles of matter in its path. It makes a beam of light visible by lighting the particles.

Under the Tyndall effect, the longer-wavelength light is more transmitted while the shorter-wavelength light is more reflected by scattering. In effect, blue light is scattered much more strongly than red light.

The blue of a clear sky, and the blue of blue eyes is caused by the Tyndall effect, not by a pigment. Its named after John Tyndall. 
Tyndall effect can also be observed when sunlight passes through the canopy of a dense forest. 
It happens due to the scattering of light by the particles of smoke and dust.

Wells Fargo

Wells Fargo is a global bank network based in California. They operate all across the world. Wells Fargo is the 4th largest bank in the United States. The bank was established in New York City in March of 1852. The founders of the bank system were Henry Wells and William Fargo, who had already made American Express.

Bracket fungus

Bracket fungi, or shelf fungi, are among the many groups of fungi in the phylum Basidiomycota.

They produce shelf- or bracket-shaped fruiting bodies called conks. These lie in a close group of horizontal rows. Brackets can range from only a single row of a few caps, to dozens of rows of caps that can weigh several hundred pounds. They are mainly found on trees (living and dead) and woody debris. Some form annual fruiting bodies while others are perennial and grow larger year after year. Bracket fungi are usually tough and sturdy. Their spores, called basidiospores, are in pores on the undersurface.

Jelly fungus

Jelly fungi are a paraphyletic group of several fungal orders from different classes of the subphylum Agaricomycotina. The name comes from their form, or growth habit. Their fruiting body is foliose or irregularly branched. It looks like jelly. Actually, many are somewhat rubbery and gelatinous. When dried, jelly fungi become hard and shriveled; when exposed to water, they return to their original form.

Some jelly fungi can be eaten raw; poisonous jelly fungi are rare. However, many species have an unpalatable texture or taste. However, some species, "Tremella fuciformis" for example, are not only edible but prized for use in soup and vegetable dishes.

Stinkhorn

The stinkhorns are a family of fungi, the Phallaceae. Belonging to the fungal order Phallales, the Phallaceae have a worldwide distribution, but are especially common in tropical regions. Their mushrooms are foul-smelling, sticky spore masses, or gleba, on the end of a stalk.

Their mushroom distinguishes the Phallaceae from other families in the Phalalles. The spore mass smells of carrion or dung, and attracts flies and other insects to help disperse the spores. Although a great diversity of body structure shape exists between the various genera, all species in the Phallaceae begin their development as oval or round structures known as "eggs". According to a 2008 estimate, the family contains 21 genera and 77 species.

Second Battle of Bull Run

The Second Battle of Bull Run (also called the Battle of Second Manassas) was a battle during the American Civil War. It was fought from August 28 to August 30, 1862. It ended in a Confederate victory.

Union president Abraham Lincoln formed the Army of Virginia near Washington, D.C. in July 1862. He put Major General John Pope in command of the army. Lincoln wanted Pope to attack the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia.

Confederate General Robert E. Lee commanded the Army of Northern Virginia. He was trying to protect Richmond from another Union army on the Peninsula. The Union Army of the Potomac had just tried to capture Richmond a few weeks before but failed. Lee would be outnumbered if the two Union armies united. He moved his army north to fight Pope.

Lee planned to send Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson's corps to the rear of Pope's army. He wanted to surround Pope. Jackson camped near the Bull Run on August 28, where the First Battle of Bull Run was fought in 1861. Jackson attacked part of Pope's army on August 28 but was defeated.

Pope then tried to attack Jackson on August 29 and destroy his corps. All of the Union attacks failed. Lee arrived during the evening with James Longstreet's corps.

Pope tried to attack Jackson again on August 30 but again was defeated. Lee then attacked Pope and routed the Union army.

There were 13,826 Union casualties in the battle. Pope retreated back to Washington. His army was combined with the Army of the Potomac. Pope was sent to Minnesota after the battle.

There were 8,353 Confederate casualties in the battle. Lee decided to invade Maryland after the battle.

Cytotoxic T cell

A cytotoxic T cell is a type of white blood cell. It is a T lymphocyte which kills cancer cells, cells infected with viruses, or cells that are damaged in other ways.

Most cytotoxic T cells have T-cell receptors (TCRs) which recognize a specific antigen from a cancer cell or virus. 

Antigens inside a cell are brought to the surface of the cell by major histocompatibility complex molecules, where they can be recognized by the T cell. If the TCR is specific for that antigen, it binds to the complex of MHC molecule and antigen, and the T cell destroys the cell.

Viscount

A Viscount (, ) is a member of the European nobility. A viscount usually ranks above a baron and below a count. The female equivalent is a Viscountess.

Beginning in the early ninth century the Carolingian kings appointed counts to run local county governments. The counts used viscounts or deputy counts to assist them.

The viscounts served as deputies of the county. They had military, financial, administrative and judicial authority. They carried out court orders and held courts of their own. Viscounts also collected money for the king. Starting with the reign of Philip the Fair they were paid regular salaries. In the early tenth century, viscounts in the south of France gave themselves the rights of counts for their own profit. In Narbonne and Nimes the office became just like that of a count. Elsewhere in France viscounts began replacing counts where they could. A Viscounty (or Viscountship) was the office, area or jurisdiction of a viscount. By the eleventh century viscounts had become hereditary offices in most of Western Europe. In Normandy, before 1066, Duke William I began to view the position of a viscount as being . After 1066, and as King of England, William made several of his viscounts in Normandy, earls in England (an English earl was about the same as a count in Europe). But there were no viscounts in the English peerage and he did not create any.

In eleventh century Italy, the office and the lands of a viscount began to be thought of as the hereditary property of the family. The title, as with that of count or marquis was used by all members of a family.

The first introduction of the title of viscount in England was in the fifteenth century. The first to be recognized, John Beaumont was already a viscount in Maine. This was to give him a rank above the barons in the English peerage. Afterward it became a regular rank in the peerage. In England, and later in the United Kingdom, a viscount ranks above a baron but below an earl. The wife of a viscount is called a countess.

On 2 July of that year, Rose returned to Tokyo to defend his title against Takao Sakurai. He beat Sakurai with a 15-round decision. On 6 December, he fought against Chucho Castillo in Inglewood, California. Rose beat Castillo by decision, but the verdicts in favour of him made many in the crowd angry, as they supported Castillo. A riot began, the referee and 14 fans were injured.

On 8 March 1969, Rose fought against Alan Rudkin. Rose won in a 15-round decision, and kept the championship. Five months later, he returned to Inglewood, where he faced Rubén Olivares on 22 August. Olivares knocked out Rose in the fifth round, and so Rose lost the world bantamweight title.

Rose continued boxing after his defeat against Olivares. However, after he lost several fights against boxers who were not very well known, many believed his career as a prime fighter was over. On 10 October 1970, he beat future world lightweight champion Itshimatsu Suzuki in a 10-round decision. Once again, he became a world title challenger, but in the lightweight division.

Rose lost to Jeff White for the Australian lightweight championship. He then fought against world junior lightweight champion Yoshiaki Numata, on 30 May 1971 in Hiroshima. Numata beat Rose by a 15-round decision. Rose announced his retirement soon after.

During his break from boxing in the 1970s, Rose begun a modest career as a singer. He had a few songs that were successful in Australia, such as "I Thank You" and "Please Remember Me" in 1970. The song "I Thank You" was one of the most successful singles in Australia in 1970. It was played instead of the Australian National Anthem during radio broadcasts of the Rugby League State of Origin.

Rose came back to boxing in 1975. However, after losing four of his six matches, including one against Rafael Limón, he decided to retire forever. As a professional boxer, Rose had a record of 42 wins and 11 losses, with 12 wins by knockout.

After boxing, Rose became a successful businessman. A television miniseries called "Rose Against the Odds" (1991) was made about Rose's life story. It starred Paul Williams and Telly Savalas. It was released as a full-length movie in 1995. Melbourne filmmaker Eddie Martin premiered his feature-length documentary "Lionel" at the Melbourne International Film Festival in 2008.

Rose was one of the original boxers to be inducted into the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame in 2003.

In 2007, Rose suffered a stroke. It left him unable to speak and move very well. He died on 8 May 2011, after an illness which lasted for several months.

Fulk II of Anjou

Fulk II of Anjou (–960), called the good (), was a French nobleman and the Count of Anjou from 942 to his death in 960.

Fulk II was born about 905. He was the son of Fulk the Red and his wife Roscilla de Loches. She was a daughter of Warnerius, Seigneur de Villentrois. He succeeded his father in 942 as the second count of Anjou (also called the count of Angers) and remained in power until 960.

The Angevins, Fulk II included, had become very good at making marriage alliances that helped their goals. His father, Fulk the Red, had arranged his marriage to a Carolingian, Gerberga, the daughter of Ratburnus I Viscount of Vienne. Among other things this marriage made it possible for their daughter Adelaide-Blanche to marry a future king of France. It made them important enough for their son Guy to become Bishop of le Puy.

After Gerberga died Fulk made another political marriage. He married Adelaide, the widow of Alan II, Duke of Brittany. Alan II had also been Count of Nantes and the marriage probably gave Fulk control of Nantes. Adelaide was also the sister of Theobald I, Count of Blois. This allowed Fulk II to form an alliance with the House of Blois. Fulk died in 960. He was succeeded by his son Geoffrey Greymantle.

By his wife, Gerberge, Fulk II had several children:


By his second wife Adelaide, he had no children.

Morpho

A Morpho is a butterfly in one of over 29 species and 147 subspecies in the genus "Morpho".

Morphos are Neotropical butterflies found mostly in South America, Mexico and Central America. Morphos range in wingspan from the 7.5 cm (3 inch) "M. rhodopteron" to the imposing 20 cm (8 inch) Sunset Morpho, "M. hecuba".

Many Morpho butterflies are coloured in metallic, shimmering shades of blue and green. These colours are not caused by pigment. They are an example of iridescence: light reflects through the microscopic scales covering the Morpho's wings.

The blue Morpho species have sexual dimorphism. In some species only the males are iridescent blue, the females are camouflaged brown and yellow. In other species the females are partially iridescent but less blue than the males.

Their habitat is the primary forests of the Amazon and Atlantic. They can breed in other forested habitats, for instance the dry deciduous woodlands of Nicaragua and in secondary forests.

Morphos are strong fliers, found at altitudes between sea level and about 1400 m. Morphos are diurnal: males spend the mornings patrolling along forest streams and rivers. They are territorial and will chase any rivals. Morphos typically live alone out of the mating season.

The adults are usually palatable, but hard to catch because they are such strong fliers. Birds find it very hard to catch them.

The conspicuous blue coloration shared by most "Morpho" species may be a case of Müllerian mimicry, or may be 'pursuit aposematism'. This means the bird learns that the colour says, in effect, "don't waste your energy, you can't catch me".

The entire life cycle of the Morpho butterfly, from egg to death, is approximately 115 days.

Although the adults are palatable, the larvae are not. Their hairs are irritating, and when disturbed they secrete a noxious fluid which smells like rancid butter. The strong odour is a defence against predators.

The caterpillar will molt five times before entering the pupal stage. The bulbous chrysalis is pale-green or jade-green and emits a repulsive, ultrasonic sound when touched. It is suspended from a stem or leaf of the foodplant.

Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)

The Wells Fargo Center is a multi-use indoor arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was called Spectrum II before it was built. It has previously been called the CoreStates Center, First Union Center and Wachovia Center.

The Wells Fargo Center is the home arena of the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League, the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association, the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League, and the Philadelphia Soul of the Arena Football League. The Center was finished in 1996 to replace the Spectrum as the home arena of the Flyers, 76ers, and Wings. It was built on the former site of John F. Kennedy Stadium (originally Philadelphia Municipal Stadium). The cost of it was $210 million, and it was mostly privately financed (though the city and state helped to pay for the local infrastructure). It is owned by Comcast Spectacor, which also owns the Flyers. Global Spectrum operates the arena. Comcast Spectacor also owns Global Spectrum. 

The Wells Fargo Center is at the southwest corner of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. Some of the buildings there are Lincoln Financial Field, Citizens Bank Park, and Xfinity Live!.

The Center officially seats 20,318 for NBA and NCAA basketball games and 19,537 for NHL hockey and indoor ("box") NLL lacrosse. With more standing-room areas available in luxury and club-box suites, the total paid capacity is actually more than that. The Center has 126 luxury suites, 1,880 club-box seats, and a many restaurants and clubs (both public and private) available for use by patrons. The offices, studios, and production facilities of Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia are all located in the facility.

On June 9, 2010, the Center set the record for the highest attendance for an indoor hockey game in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania (20,327) when the Flyers lost Game 6 of the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals to the Chicago Blackhawks. The Center also set a record for the highest attendances for a college basketball game in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania on February 13, 2006, when Villanova University played and defeated the #1 ranked University of Connecticut before a crowd of 20,859.

On August 1, 2006, Comcast Spectacor announced it would add a new center-hung scoreboard to replace the original one made by Daktronics. The new scoreboard, manufactured by ANC Sports is like other scoreboards in new NBA & NHL arenas. Another linear LED display lining the entire arena was also added between the suite and mezzanine levels. Other renovations for the Center's ten-year anniversary included upgrading the suites with more flat screen TV's, as well as changing ticket providers from Ticketmaster to New Era Tickets, which is owned by Comcast Spectacor.

The PA announcer at the Center for Flyers games is Lou Nolan, who moved with the team from the Spectrum, where he has worked since 1972. Matt Cord is the PA announcer for 76ers games. Jim Bachman is the PA announcer for Villanova basketball games. Kevin Casey handles PA duties for the Philadelphia Wings.

Protocol 41

Protocol 41 is a communication protocol which embeds internet protocol version 6 (IPv6) packets inside Internet protocol version 4 (IPv4) packets. It is usually used to allow a computer or router with only an IPv4 address to obtain an IPv6 address (or maybe more than one address, to serve more than one computer). Most IPv6 tunnel providers support Protocol 41, including Hurricane Electric. 6to4, 6rd, and 6in4 are all different ways of using Protocol 41. Protocol 41 does not use TCP or UDP (although the IPv6 packets inside can carry TCP and UDP traffic). It is not to be confused with TCP or UDP port number 41.

6to4 is a special usage of protocol 41. A 6to4 address starts with the digits 2002, followed by the IPv4 address of its router. A 6to4 address might look like: 2002:CB00:71FF:0:fe64:3486:d398:3346


Castor and Pollux

Castor and Pollux were twin brothers in Greek and Roman mythology. Together they are called the Dioscuri. They were the sons of Queen Leda of Sparta. Their twin sisters were Helen of Troy and Clytemnestra. Castor and Pollux were changed into the constellation called Gemini. Tyndareus, the king of Sparta, was the father of Castor, which made Castor mortal, while Zeus was the father of Pollux which made him a demigod.

Zeus seduced Leda as a swan and she laid four eggs, these eggs hatched and four children were born to Leda, the two brothers Castor and Pollux, and two sisters, Helen and Clytemnestra; Castor and Clytemnestra were considered to be the children of King Tyndareus, Pollux and Helen were the demigod offspring of Zeus.

Castor and Pollux are universally named among the Argonauts, the crew of the Argo who sailed for Colchis with Jason. During the quest for the Golden Fleece, Pollux is noted for having bested the King of Bebryces during a boxing match.

One of the best-known myths with Castor and Pollux is how they became a constellation. During a battle, Castor, being mortal, was killed. Heartbroken at the death of his brother, Pollux prayed to Zeus to make Castor immortal which meant Pollux would have to give up half of his immortality. Eventually, Zeus agreed to the request, and so Castor and Pollux were transformed into the Gemini constellation. To balance the cosmos, the Dioscuri would only be on Olympus one half of the year, and the other six months would be spent in the Underworld in the Elysium fields.

They became the gods of sailing and horsemanship. ... Pollux and Castor were also known for their boxing abilities and were thus the gods of athletes and athletic competitions. In both art and literature, Pollux and his brother were shown with horses, as the two were famed horsemen.

On Human Nature

On Human Nature is a 1979 Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson. 

The book tries to explain how aspects of humans and society can be explained from the point of view of evolution. He explains how evolution has left its traces on the characteristics which are the specialty of the human species. Examples are generosity, self-sacrifice, worship and the use of sex for pleasure. 

The book was an attempt to complete the Darwinian revolution by bringing biological thought into social sciences and humanities.

Sociobiology: the new synthesis

Sociobiology: the new synthesis is a book by E.O. Wilson that helped start the sociobiology debate, one of the great scientific controversies of the 20th century. Wilson popularized the term "sociobiology" as an attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind behaviours such as altruism, aggression, and nurture. The fundamental principles guiding sociobiology are:

The book was first published in 1975, then reprinted in 1976. A twenty-fifth anniversary edition was published in 2000 by Harvard University Press.

The application of sociobiology to humans was immediately controversial. Some people, such as Stephen Jay Gould, and Richard Lewontin said that sociobiology was biologicially determinist. They argued that it would be used, as similar ideas had been in the past, to justify the status quo, entrench ruling elites, and legitimize authoritarian political programmes. They referred to social darwinism and eugenics of the early 20th century, and to other more recent ideas, such as the race and IQ controversy of the early 1970s as cautionary tales in the use of evolutionary principles as applied to human society.

Wilson and his admirers countered these criticisms by saying that Wilson had no political agenda, and if he had one it was certainly not authoritarian (Wilson is an outspoken environmentalist). They argued that sociobiology does not necessarily lead to any particular political ideology as many critics implied.

Many other sociobiologists have used sociobiology to argue quite separate points. Noam Chomsky surprised many by coming to the defense of sociobiology on the grounds that political radicals need to postulate a relatively fixed idea of human nature in order to be able to struggle for a better society. They needed to know what human needs were in order to build a better society.

An extensive account of the controversy around the book was published 25 years later. It largely supporting Wilson's views. For ethologists, Wilson's ideas are mainstream, and for them his book is not controversial.


Geoffrey I, Count of Anjou

Geoffrey I of Anjou (930–987), called Greymantle (), was a French nobleman who was the Count of Anjou from 960 to 987. He greatly increased the power and influence of Anjou.

Geoffrey was the oldest son of Fulk II of Anjou and his first wife Gerberga.<ref name="ESIII/4-116">Detlev Schwennicke, "Europäische Stammtafeln|Europäische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europäischen Staaten", Neue Folge, Band III Teilband 1 (J. A. Stargardt, Marburg, Germany, 1984), Tafel 116</ref> He succeeded his father as Count of Anjou about 960. Geoffrey married Adele of Meaux (934–982). Adele was the daughter of Robert of Vermandois and Adelais de Vergy. On her mother's side she was a granddaughter of king Robert I of France. On her father's side she was a direct descendant of Charlemagne. Her cousin was Hugh Capet, King of the Franks. Through this marriage the Angevins joined the highest ranks of western French nobility. 

Geoffrey started by making his power base the of Angers. Geoffrey carefully placed his loyal followers on lands surrounding the city. This was to protect his own territories. The lands of the abbeys of Saint-Aubin and Saint-Serge in Angers provided revenues for his most faithful men. Geoffrey told both his sons, Fulk and Maurice: "No house is weak that has many friends. Therefore I you to hold dear those who have been friends." Geoffrey used several ways of expanding his power and control. Creating family connections was one way. For example his father had controlled Nantes by marrying the countess. Geoffrey brought Nantes under control by making Count Guerech accept him as overlord. For some time the counts of Maine and the bishops of Le Mans had been fighting among themselves. Geoffrey saw a way to take advantage of the situation. About 971 Geoffrey secured the diocese of Le Mans for his ally and friend Bishop Seinfroy. Then, in 973, Geoffrey arranged the marriage of his daughter Ermengarde-Gerberga to Conan I of Rennes, the count of Maine. But rather than act like an ally Conan began to oppose Geoffrey. In 982 the two met at the first battle of Conquereuil where Geoffrey defeated Conan. 

Geoffrey had influence in Aquitaine through his sister Adelaide-Blanche's first marriage to the powerful baron Stephen, Count of Gevaudan and Forez. After his death the lands were ruled by his widow Adelaide-Blanche. Their sons, Geoffrey's nephews, Pons and Bertrand succeeded as counts there. Geoffrey's niece, Adalmode, married Adelbert, Count of Marche and Périgord. In 975 Geoffrey had his brother Guy appointed as the Count and Bishop of Le Puy. In 982 Geoffrey married his now widowed sister Adelaide-Blanche to the fifteen-year-old Louis V of France. The two were crowned King and Queen of Aquitaine. But the two could not get along and the marriage failed. So did Geoffrey's plans to control Aquitaine through his young son-in-law. 

After the death of his first wife Adele, Geoffrey married secondly Adelaise de Châlon. By this marriage he exerted control over the county of Châlons. Through the marriage of his son, Fulk III, to Elisabeth the heiress of Vendôme Geoffrey brought that county under his influence. Geoffrey made his son Fulk Nerra his co-ruler just before he died while attacking the fortress of Marcon on 21 July 987.

He married Adele of Meaux (934–982), daughter of Robert of Vermandois and Adelais de Vergy. Their children were:


He married, secondly, to Adelaise de Châlons and had one child:

Land reclamation

Land reclamation is the idea of getting new land. It is usually done in coastal areas. Sometimes it is also done in areas like rivers and lakes. Usually, there is a natural process which fills such areas with sand, dirt and other materials. Land reclamation uses the same process, which is sped up. In many cases, this is done using dikes. An example where land reclamation is done is the in the Netherlands.

Pioneer plants, such as Salicornia or grow there. When the level of the land is as high as that of the high tide, new ditches are dug, and the process can repeat.

Sometimes, it is too time-consuming to wait for the land to rise. In that case, it is possible to pump out the water in the enclosed area. This was done in the Netherlands, where many areas are below sea level. The problem with this approach is that it needs to be repeated, for example in the case of heavy rainfall.
Few examples are Kansai Airport in Osaka, Japan.

The creation of large, artificial islands, such as Palm Islands in Dubai or , which is part of the port of Rotterdam is not known as Land reclamation.

List of Atlantic hurricanes in the 18th century

While information for every storm that happened is not available, some parts of the coastline had enough people to give information of hurricane happenings. Each season was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic basin. Most tropical cyclone formation occurs between June 1 and November 30.

Although not listed below, the Great Storm of 1703 that struck the Kingdom of England may have been a hurricane.

The 1780 Atlantic hurricane season was a very deadly hurricane season. About 25,000 people died mainly due to three storms in October.



Crossing the Rubicon

Crossing the Rubicon is a metaphor similar to "Burning one's bridges" and "the point of no return". It means passing a decisive point, where one cannot turn back. It comes from a genuine historical incident. The Rubicon is a shallow river in north-east Italy. According to Roman tradition and law Roman legions could not be brought south of the river without permission of the Roman Senate.

In 50 BC, the Senate, led by Pompey, ordered Julius Caesar to disband his army and return to Rome because his term as governor of Gaul had finished. Caesar thought he would be prosecuted if he entered Rome without the immunity enjoyed by a magistrate. Pompey accused Caesar of insubordination and treason.

Caesar and his army approached Rome and "crossed the Rubicon" in 49 BC. It was the point beyond which no army was supposed to go. The river marked the boundary between Cisalpine Gaul to the north, and Italy proper to the south. Pompey, the lawful Consul, and his friends, fled from Rome as Caesar's army approached. So began a civil war in which Caesar eventually triumphed.

What Caesar reportedly said at the crossing of the Rubicon is "Alea iacta est" ("The die is cast"). This is yet another metaphor. It comes from gambling with dice: once the die or dice have been thrown, no bets can be withdrawn or added, even before the dice have come to rest.

Pico Ruivo

Pico Ruivo ("red peak" in Portuguese) is, with its , the highest point of the island of Madeira and the third summit of Portugal (after Mount Pico in Pico Island, Azores, and Torre in continental Portugal).

Pico Ruivo is in the Central Mountainous Massif, in the municipality of Santana, where there are also other high mountains like the "Pico das Torres", with and the "Pico do Arieiro", with .

Although of moderate altitude, the top has a very rocky landscape. The only vegetation that can develop there is of plants that grow on or among rocks.

There are two main types of vegetation: one with heathers, widespread on the island, and another with few herbaceous plants. A special feature for this altitude is the presence of small shrubs and heather trees.

Some birds found on Pico Ruivo are the common blackbird, chaffinch and the Madeira firecrest. The red-legged partridge and the common linnet also nest on Pico Ruivo.

Until a few years ago, its slopes were used for raising goats, sheep and cows. However, to conserve the biodiversity in the region (such as the protection of the bird "freira-da-madeira" and plant communities in altitude), this practice was prohibited and the entire area around the peak is recovering.

The summit of Pico Ruivo can be reached only on foot:

The prince was in a minimally conscious state and it was unclear whether he would ever regain full consciousness. After nearly a year and a half in a coma, he died on 12 August 2013.


Russell's paradox

Russell's Paradox is the theory that states: If you have a list of lists that do not list themselves, then that list must list itself, because it doesn't contain itself. However, if it lists itself, it then contains itself, meaning it cannot list itself. This makes logical usages of lists of lists that don't contain themselves somewhat difficult. It was developed by Bertrand Russell.

Fulk III of Anjou

Fulk III "Nerra" (970–1040), was a French nobleman who was the Count of Anjou from 987 to his death. He built up Angevin power by building a network of castles. 

Fulk was the son of Geoffrey I, Count of Anjou and Adele of Meaux. He was born about 970. Fulk was born into a dynasty of counts going back nearly a hundred years. His father, grandfather, great-grandfather and second great-grandfather had all been counts of Anjou before him. His father, Geoffrey I had been preparing Fulk to be count as he raised him. He was about age seventeen when his father died and Fulk became the next count. Two years earlier, in 985, his father arranged for him to be married to Elizabeth de Vendome, daughter of Bouchard, Count of Vendome. His nickname "Nerra" meant 'the Black'. It was probably given to him after his death.

His first years as count were a constant fight for survival. His western borders and his holdings in Touraine were not secure. His concerns were mainly holding and defending Angevin interests. Fulk also faced opposition from the church. Bishop Renaud of Angers and Guntarius abbot of St. Aubin both thought they could take advantage of an inexperienced young count. They wanted to take back lands they lost to Fulk's father, Geoffrey. But Fulk had a powerful ally in his uncle, Bishop Guy of Le Puy. Guy stepped in and sent the abbot on a pilgrimage and used force against Bishop Renaud.

Fulk fought against Conan I of Rennes at the Battle of Conquereuil on 27 June 992. Even though Conan had lost a battle to Fulk's father years before, he was still a powerful force in the region. Defeating and killing Conan gave Fulk Nerra a reputation as a very capable commander. Fulk then extended his power over Maine and Touraine. 

Fulk Nerra had a longstanding rivalry with Odo II, Count of Blois. Hugh Capet, the king of France had supported the Angevins against Blois. But king Robert II of France had been married to Bertha, (Odo II's mother) and supported Blois against Anjou. The king opposed Fulk's designs on Touraine and this forced him to pull back to Anjou. When Fulk went to the Holy Land Odo II tried to take advantage. He built three new castles to counter those built by Fulk. When Robert II married again, this time to Constance of Arles, she was Fulk's cousin. Relations between the king and Fulk improved. When Count Hugh of Beauvais, a favorite of King Robert, began speaking against his new wife Constance, Fulk had him killed. This turned the king and the church against Fulk. To ask forgiveness, Fulk took a trip to the Holy Land (he made four total). When he returned he built a new monastery. The king decided to stay with Constance. He and Fulk reconcilled in Rome in 1016. That same year war broke out between Fulk and Odo II of Blois. Fulk allied with Herbert I, Count of Maine, called Wakedog, and they attacked Tours. Odo II came in response and the two met on 6 July 1016. Although he was knocked off his horse, Herbert Wakedog rescued him. Fulk defeated Odo II at the Battle of Pontlevoy. 

Odo II fell out of favor with king Robert. Robert asked Fulk to help him against Odo II, which he did. In 1026 when Odo II beseiged Montboyau, Fulk Nerra attacked Saumur. Fulk kept Samur while Odo II lost Montboyau. In the later part of his reign Fulk made several gains in the south including much of Poitou and built a castle there to protect his interests.

In defending his territory Fulk had a large number of castles and other fortifications built. Fulk used these castles both offensively and defensively. Some of his fortresses cut in half the territory of a neighboring lord. Others were used as forward bases for attacking Touraine.

Fulk could be ruthless at times. His treatment of his first wife is an example. When he thought she had committed adultery, he ordered his countess to be executed by burning. They had been married nearly fifteen years when she died. Fulk continued to control Vendome through their daughter, Adele, and her family. In 1028 Fulk and his second wife, Hildegarde, founded the abbey of Le Ronceray. Originally a church dedicated to St. Mary, Hildegard was very active in its rebuilding into an abbey. They gave the abbey many gifts including the forest of Lattay. Fulk died 1 April 1040 while returning from his last pilgrimage.

Fulk's first wife was Elizabeth de Vendome. Together they had a daughter: 
His second wife was Hildegard of Lorraine. Together they had two children:

Sophie Germain prime

A Sophie Germain prime is a type of prime number. If a prime number is still prime after being multiplied by 2 and adding 1 to the answer, then the original prime is a Sophie Germain prime. A mathematical definition is: a prime number, denoted by "p", is a Sophie Germain prime if "2p+1" is also a prime number. "2p+1" is called a safe prime if it is a prime number.

Sophie Germain primes are named after the French mathematician Sophie Germain.

Many mathematicians believe that there are an infinite amount of Sophie Germain primes, but this has not been proven.

11 is a Sophie Germain prime because 23 ((2 × 11) + 1 = 23) is also a prime number.

13 is a prime number but not a Sophie Germain prime because 27 ((2 × 13) + 1 = 27) is not a prime number.

Touraine has a network of rivers. The Loire and its tributaries the Cher, the Indre and the Vienne all make up a part of the Paris river basin. It is well known for its wine. The TGV connects Tours with Paris. The trip takes less than an hour. This has made Touraine a place of residence for people who work in the capital but seek a different quality of life.

Touraine takes its name from a Celtic tribe called the Turones, who inhabited the Tours region about two thousand years ago. 
In 1044, the control of Touraine was given to the counts of Anjou. This same dynasty who (as the House of Plantagenet) became kings of England in 1154. The castle of Chinon was their great stronghold. In 1205, Philip II Augustus of France regained Touraine. At this time, Touraine was made into a Duchy. In 1429, Saint Joan of Arc had a historic meeting with the future King of France Charles VII at Chinon. Throughout the late 15th and 16th centuries, Touraine was a favorite residence of French kings. The castles were converted to Renaissance ; for this reason the region was titled "The Garden of France". These same châteaux became popular tourist attractions in modern times. The royal duchy became a province in 1584, and was divided into departments in 1790.

Eve Hewson

Eve Hewson (born 7 July 1991) is an Irish actress. She is the daughter of U2's lead singer Bono and Irish activist Ali Hewson. Her first big movie role was in Paolo Sorrentino's "This Must Be the Place" in 2011, with Sean Penn.

Hewson was born on 7 July 1991 in Dublin. She was named Eve because she was born on 7 July at 7:00pm, and "eve" is the middle of the word "seven". She has three siblings. She was educated at St. Andrew's College in Dublin and attended New York University (NYU).

U2 song "Kite" was based on a time when Bono his daughters to fly kite on Killiney Hill. When the kite smashed, Eve asked if they could go home to play with their Tamagotchis.

Hewson's parents did not want her to be a performer. However she was in a short movie in 2005 with her sister. This was Erica Dunton's short movie, "Lost and Found". her first feature-length movie was in 2008, in Dunton's "The 27 Club". The same year Hewson took part in an acting programme at the New York Film Academy. In 2010 she was in a music video and short movie for Irish band The Script's song "For the First Time".

Ali Hewson

Alison "Ali" Hewson (née Stewart; 23 March 1961) is an Irish activist and businesswoman. She is the wife of singer and musician Paul Hewson, known as Bono, from the rock group U2.

Raised in Raheny, she met her future husband at a young age at Mount Temple Comprehensive School and married him in 1982. She has a degree in politics and sociology from University College Dublin in 1989. The couple have four children together and live at residences in Ireland, France, and the United States. She has inspired several U2 songs, most famously "Sweetest Thing".

Alison Stewart was born on 23 March 1961,the daughter of Terry and Joy Stewart and the granddaughter of Hector Grey, a well known Dublin trader and shop owner. Alison studied at Mount Temple Comprehensive School where, at the age of twelve, she met Paul Hewson, who was a grade ahead of her.

She married Bono on 21 August 1982 in a Church of Ireland ceremony at All Saints Church, Raheny. In debt to U2's label, Island Records, the couple did not have ready funds for a honeymoon, but label head Chris Blackwell gave them use of the Goldeneye estate he owned in Jamaica. At first, the newly married couple shared a small mews house in Howth with the rest of the band. It took her a while to enjoy the band's music, as her own tastes ran toward her father's Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole records.

In 1992, Hewson participated in Greenpeace protests against the Sellafield plant for nuclear reprocessing, located across the Irish Sea in Cumbria, England. This involvement led her to become interested in the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986.

Since 1994, Hewson has been a patron of Chernobyl Children's Project International

In 2005, Hewson, Bono and designer Rogan Gregory co-founded the Edun fashion label ("nude" spelled backwards, to suggest both "natural" and the Garden of Eden). It was intended to help bring about positive change in Africa through a fair trade-based relationship rather than by direct aid.

Songs written by Bono that were at least in part inspired by Ali go back to the earliest period of the band's recording career, with the track "Another Time, Another Place" off their 1980 first album, "Boy". She helped Bono get through a bad period of writer's block during the lead-up to the 1983 "War" album and especially in the lyric composition for "Sunday Bloody Sunday". She was the inspiration for the personal themes of "New Year's Day" on that record as well. The album and the accompanying War Tour brought financial success to the band, and Bono and Ali moved into a three-level, three-room Martello tower in Bray for some years. The group's 1984 song "Promenade" reflects both that location and the spiritual aspects of his desire for her.

The U2 song "Sweetest Thing" was written for Hewson as a gift because Bono forgot her birthday whilst recording with the band during "The Joshua Tree" sessions. Originally released as a B-side in 1987, it was later re-recorded and released as a single from the compilation album "The Best of 1980–1990" in 1998. Hewson agreed to appear in the single's music video as long as all proceeds from it went to Chernobyl Children's Project.

Madeiran wall lizard

The Madeira wall lizard ("Teira dugesii") or Madeira lizard is a species of lizard in the Lacertidae family, and the only member of the genus "Teira".

This Madeira wall lizard is endemic to the Madeira Islands, Portugal, where it is abundant. In the Azores, this lizard is found after involuntary introduction during the 19th century by ship trade between the two archipelagos, but the lizards have never reached the population numbers as in their territory of origin. There is also a small population in the port area of Lisbon, probably accidentally transported in ships carrying bananas, and first found in 1992; a study of 2001 found that the population has remained stable in size since its discovery.

The species was named after the French zoologist Louis Antoine Dugès (1797–1838).

The subspecies "Teira dugesii mauli" (Mertens, 1938) from the Desertas Islands now is a synonym of "Teira dugesii dugesii". "Atlantolacerta andreanskyi" (Andreansky's lizard) from Morocco, and "Scelarcis perspicillata" (Menorca wall lizard) from Morocco, Algeria and Minorca, were in the genus "Teira" but now are in other genera.

The species "Teira dugessii" presents three subspecies:

These lizards can reach in length, although adults have usually between . Their color can vary from light brown to dark gray, but with some of them (usually males) may show other colors, like green, blue and violet. Males can be easily distinguished from females due to the presence of a yellow at the bottom of the hind legs.

The females lay two to three groups of eggs annually. And some individuals could live to 16 years or more.
Despite being essentially an insectivorous species, ripe fruits and berries (especially blackberries) are also part of their diet.

This species is generally found in arid areas where the vegetation is not dense. It may also occur in open woodland, areas with rocks and where crops are grown.


Moab

Moab (not to be confused with Moab, the city in Utah) is the historical name for an area of land in Jordan. The mountainous land covers the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. In ancient times, it was the Kingdom of Möab. There have been many archaeological findings that have helped reconstruct its history. It is also described in the Old Testament of the Bible. According to Genesis (19:37), it was inhabited by the children of Moab, a grandson and sonof Lot. The Moabites were often at war with its neighbours to the west, the Israelites.

The capital of Moab was Dibon.

A well-known Moabite is Ruth. According to the Biblical Book of Ruth, she married an Israelite man and became the greatgrandmother of king David.

Feng shui

Feng Shui () is a Chinese system of luck. It has to do with the laws which help one improve luck.

Feng Shui means "wind and water" in Chinese. Invented by the Taoists, many people implement its philosophies in their everyday lives. Feng Shui has five basic "elements", they are: Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, and Wood. These elements are set up in a specific way so that it shows Fire makes Earth, Earth creates Metal, Metal holds Water, Water nurtures Wood, and Wood feeds Fire. Also, Earth dams Water, Water extinguishes Fire, Fire melts Metal, Metal cuts Wood, and Wood consumes Earth.

There are multiple Feng Shui schools such as "The Western School of Feng Shui" and "The American Feng Shui Institute"

Exogeny

Exogeny refers to coming from the outside. People, planets, computers, and anything else can be influenced either by things in its environment or by things within itself. Things from within itself are indigenous.

The Earth is shaped by many geological processes. The forces that make these things happen come from both inside and outside the Earth.

In geology, exogenous processes come from forces "on or above" the Earth's surface. Processes caused by forces from "within" the Earth are endogenous processes. "Exo" is a prefix meaning "out", and "endo" is a prefix meaning "in".

Many exogenous (extraterrestrial) forces are caused by other bodies in the Solar System. For example, the Moon causes tides in the Earth's oceans and other big bodies of water. Impacts from comets and meteoroids change the surface of the Earth. When they strike the Earth, they make craters in the ground.

The Sun is the main exogenous influence in the Solar System. It has many effects on Earth. Radiation from the Sun is a main cause of the surface temperature of the Earth, and for the growth of plant life. We are partly shielded from the Sun's solar wind by the Earth's magnetic field. Storms of solar particles would otherwise strip away the ozone layer which protects us from ultraviolet radiation. Sometimes we see aurorae, which are lights that can be seen at night near the poles.

An example of an exogenous process that is not as a result of bodies in space is erosion. Erosion is mostly made by precipitation such as rain and snow, and by wind. 

There are three main endogenous geological processes: folding, faulting and volcanism. They take place mainly along the plate boundaries. These are the zones on the edges of plates. Endogenous processes cause many major landform features.

Tonic immobility

Tonic immobility is a natural state of paralysis that animals enter, often called animal hypnosis. Its function is not certain. It may be related to mating in certain animals like sharks and mammalia. It may also be a way of avoiding or deterring predators (playing dead is called thanatosis).

Tonic immobility has also been used for the paralysis that often immobilizes animals, such as rodents or birds, when they feel threatened by a predator. Tonic immobility plays a role in survival if it helps a hunted animal to blend in with its surroundings. 

Tonic immobility can be induced without causing any apparent stress to the animal. For example, stroking a particular area of a lobster's shell or focusing a hen's attention on a line on the ground.

Tonic immobility has also been said to occur in humans that are subject to intense trauma, such as rape or sexual assault. Catatonia in humans is a serious psychiatric condition that often involves a state of immobility.

Some sharks can be placed in a tonic state. The shark remains in this state of paralysis for an average of fifteen minutes before it recovers. Scientists have exploited this phenomenon to study shark behaviour. 

Some sharks go into tonic immobility when they are turned upside down. With tiger sharks (measuring 3–4 metres, or 10–15 feet, in length), tonic immobility may be achieved by placing hands lightly on the sides of the animal's snout in the area surrounding its eyes. Scientists believe that tonic immobility in sharks may be related to mating, because female sharks seem more responsive than males. During tonic immobility, the dorsal fin(s) straighten, and both breathing and muscle contractions become more steady and relaxed.

Great White Sharks are not so responsive as other species when tonic immobility has been attempted. In an interesting eye witness case off the coast of California, a female orca was seen holding the shark upside down to induce tonic immobility. It kept the shark still for fifteen minutes, causing it to suffocate to death. This was the first recorded eye witness case of predation on a great white shark in the wild by a species other than humans. Another case of orcas purposely inducing tonic immobility in fish has been seen with stingrays in New Zealand. In this case, the orcas turn themselves upside down before attacking, trap the stingrays in their mouths, then quickly right themselves, in turn flipping the stingray over, inducing the tonic immobility, rendering the fish helpless and an easy meal.

A chicken can be "hypnotized", or put into a trance, by holding its head down against the ground, and drawing a line along the ground with a stick or a finger, starting at the beak and extending straight outward in front of the chicken. If the chicken is hypnotized in this manner, it will remain immobile for somewhere between 15 seconds and 30 minutes, continuing to stare at the line. One theory is that the trance is caused by fear, which is probably a defensive mechanism intended to feign death, albeit rather poorly.

The first known written reference for this method came in 1646, in "Mirabile Experimentum de Imaginatione Gallinae" by Athanasius Kircher in Rome. 

Another hypnosis technique is to hold the chicken face up with its back on the ground, and then run a finger downwards from the chicken's wattles to just above its vent. The chicken's feet are exposed, which facilitates the application of medication for foot mites, etc. Clapping hands or giving the chicken a gentle shove will awaken it.

One can also hypnotize a chicken by mimicking how it sleeps with its head under its wing. In this method, hold the bird firmly, placing its head under its wing, then, gently rock the chicken back and forth and set it very carefully on the ground. It should stay in the same position for about 30 seconds. H.B. Gibson, in his book "Hypnosis: its nature and therapeutic uses", says the record period for a chicken remaining in hypnosis is 3 hours 47 minutes.

Trout tickling is the art of rubbing the underbelly of a trout using fingers. If done properly, the trout will go into a trance-like state after a minute or so, and can then easily be thrown onto the nearest bit of dry land.

The rationale for the tonic immobility test is that the experimenter simulates a predator thereby eliciting an anti-predator response "death feigning". The precept is that the prey animal 'pretends' to be dead to be able to escape when/if the predator relaxes its concentration. Death feigning birds often take advantage of escape opportunities; tonic immobility in quail reduces the probability of the birds being predated by cats.

To induce tonic immobility, the animal is gently restrained on its side or back for a period of time, e.g. 15 seconds. This is done either on a firm, flat surface or sometimes in a purpose-built ‘V’ or ‘U’-shaped restraining cradle. In rodents, the response is sometimes induced by additionally pinching or attaching a clamp to the skin at the nape of the neck. Scientists record behaviours, such as the number of inductions (15 second restraining periods) required for the animal to remain still, the latency to the first major movements (often cycling motions of the legs), latency to first head or eye movements and the duration of immobility, sometimes called the ‘righting time’. 

Tonic immobility has been used to show that hens in cages are more fearful than those in pens. Hens on the top tier of tiered battery cages are more fearful than those on the lower levels. Hens carried by hand are more fearful than hens carried on a mechanical conveyor. Hens transported for longer times are more fearful than those transported for shorter times.

Tonic immobility as a scientific tool has also been used with mice, gerbils, guinea pigs, rats, rabbits. pigs and monkeys.

Vasoconstriction

Vasoconstriction occurs when blood vessels become narrower because of the tightening of the muscles in their walls. Its opposite is vasodilation, which is when blood vessels widen. For example, when you are cold, blood vessels near the skin vasoconstrict so that you don't lose too much heat from your blood. 

When blood vessels vasoconstrict, this increases blood pressure. Sometimes, blood pressure is too high and this can cause heart disease, so people have to take medicine to make the muscles in the blood vessels relax.

A Boy Named Sue

"A Boy Named Sue" is a song written by Shel Silverstein. It was first made popular by Johnny Cash. Cash was at the height of his popularity when he recorded the song live at California's San Quentin State Prison at a concert on February 24, 1969. The concert was taped by Granada Television. It was later shown as a television program. Carl Perkins played guitar during the performance. 

The sound recording of the concert was later released on Cash's "At San Quentin" album by Columbia Records. Cash also sang the song as a comedy performance in December 1969 at Madison Square Garden. 

The song became Cash's biggest hit on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. It was his only top ten single there, spending three weeks at No. 2 in 1969. The track was also at the top of the "Billboard" Hot Country Songs and Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts that same year. It was certified Gold on August 14, 1969, by the RIAA.

Shel Silverstein's recording was released the same year as "Boy Named Sue". It was a single on his album "Boy Named Sue (and His Other Country Songs)". It was produced by Chet Atkins and Felton Jarvis.

The story of the song was inspired by the writer Jean Shepherd, a close friend of Shel Silverstein. He was often made fun of as a child because of his feminine-sounding name.

In his autobiography, Cash wrote that he had just been given the song and only read it a couple of times. It was included in that concert just to try it out. He did not know the words when he first sang it. On the video recording, he can be seen regularly looking at a piece of paper. Cash was surprised at how well the song went over with the audience.

Triangular trade

The triangular trade refers to trade between three ports or regions. Triangular trade usually develops when a region is exporting resources that are not needed in the region from which its main imports come. Instead, the resources are exported to a third region. The routes involved were historically also shaped by the winds and currents during the age of sailing ships.

The best-known triangular trading systems were across the Atlantic Ocean, especially the Atlantic slave trade, which lasted from the late 16th to early 19th centuries. During this time, European countries such as Britain, Spain and France had colonies in the Americas and Africa. The ships carrying slaves, crops and manufactured goods between West Africa, the Caribbean and American colonies and the colonial powers in Europe. The use of African slaves was very important to growing colonial cash crops, which were exported to Europe. European goods, in turn, were used to buy African slaves, which were then brought west from Africa to the Americas to work on the crops. The middle passage of the triangular trade refers to the transportation of the slaves to America.

The Atlantic economy was tied into the idea of mercantilism, which thought it was a good idea for European countries to have a lot of colonies that traded only with them. Goods that were traded in the Atlantic economy were rum, slaves, sugar, tobacco, gold, spices, fish, lumber and manufactured goods. Triangular trading became less common in the 20th century due to free trade and ships specialized for particular cargoes.


Waistline (clothing)

The waistline is the part of a piece of clothing that sits on the wearer's waist. The actual position of the waitline can be different depending on the fashion or how the person chooses to wear the garment, but it is normally just above the hips.

Waistlines can be secured with a variety of methods, such as buttons, knots and zippers. A waistband is a strip of elastic rubber that adjusts to keep the item tight against the body.

Waistline

Waistline can mean several things:


Heliocentrism

Heliocentrism is the idea that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun, which is the center of the solar system. Many people proposed heliocentrism, such as Aristarchus of Samos from ancient Greece, but Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to think of good reasons why it is true. This was the beginning of modern astronomy.

Before Copernicus, most people thought that the Sun and the other planets revolved around the Earth (this was called geocentrism). This is because if you stand on Earth, it looks like the Sun and stars are moving across the sky. However, when people watched for many years they saw many things that did not make sense if the Earth was the center of the Solar system. For example, sometimes the planets seemed to move back and forth instead of moving around the Earth. Copernicus explained why these things happen in 1543, when he published the book "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium" ("On the revolutions of the heavenly spheres"). This gave his reasons for thinking the Sun was at the center instead.

Other astronomers who made further advances after Copernicus were Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei. For example, Kepler showed that the planets do not orbit in perfect circles, and Galileo built very good telescopes that helped to confirm the heliocentric model.

Copernicus also thought that the sun was the center of the universe, but we now know that this is incorrect. The Sun is part of the Milky Way galaxy which is one out of billions of galaxies.


Trance

Trance describes a state of mind. A trance is when a person is conscious, and not sleeping, but is unaware of what is happening around him or her.

The term "trance" is associated with hypnosis, meditation, magic, flow, religion, and certain kinds of music. It is an "altered state of consciousness".

There are many efforts to define what a trance is. Some think it is a borderland between normal consciousness and spirituality

The most straightforward example is when a person is hypnotized, they are in a trance. Conscious, and responding to the hypnotist, the person seems to block out other thoughts and other information.

Another common example is the day-dream, where a person's mind drifts across private thoughts. Everyone daydreams, but young children constantly daydream, and have vivid imaginary fantasies. This is entirely normal. In the language of psychology, this kind of temporary separation from one's surroundings is called "dissociation". Research shows that a lot is going on when we daydream.

There are many examples of trance in religion. African animistic religions, such as that of the Yoruba, feature dances in celebration of the spirits. Under the influence of rhythm and song, a group dances, often for hours at a time. During this time, various members of the group may fall into trances, and some may act as if possessed by one of the spirits being worshiped. States of "spiritual ecstasy" are known in most forms of Christian worship. It is a main part of those aspects of religion known as "mysticism".


Spitzer Space Telescope

The Spitzer Space Telescope is a telescope launched into space by NASA in 2003. It is the fourth telescope in the Great Observatories program (the Hubble Space Telescope was the first). The Hubble Space Telescope takes pictures of visible light, and the Spitzer Space Telescope takes pictures of infrared light. Unlike Hubble, Spitzer orbits the Sun instead of the Earth.

The Spitzer Space Telescope is named after the scientist Lyman Spitzer. It was planned to last for 2.5 years, but it actually lasted until 2009 when it exhausted its supply of coolant. Some parts of the telescope can work even when they are warm, and are still working.

The Spitzer Space Telescope was able to see very good detail. Spitzer was the first telescope that could see light from extrasolar planets (planets outside the Solar System.) It was also able to see some of the first stars in the universe, believed to be only 100 million years after the Big Bang.


Age of the universe

In cosmology, the age of the universe is the amount of time since the Big Bang. The best measurement of the age of the Universe is 13.8 billion years (specifically, 13.798±0.037 billion years). The most recent and most accurate measurements were made by the Planck spacecraft. These measurements were made using the cosmic microwave background radiation and the expansion of the Universe.

In the 1800s, evidence from geology showed that the Earth was at least millions of years old. Later, it was thought that the universe was unchanging. However, in the 1920s, Georges Lemaître and Edwin Hubble determined that the universe was expanding (see Hubble's law). Although the estimates made using the initial data were low, radioactive dating on Earth could be used to give measurements of 11–20 billion years to 13–15 billion years. Eventually, scientists were able to make much better measurements using spacecraft.

Essentially unknown, but there are various theories that explain the possible future of planet Earth. There are various scientific theories that explains how the Earth might end. Among of them, one of the most popular theories is that the Sun will eventually become a red giant and consume the Earth. However, there are other logical theories that explain how the Earth might end.

Yoruba

Yoruba can mean:


Nominative case

In grammar, the nominative case is the grammatical case used when talking about the subject of the sentence. For example, "the boy kissed the girl." 
The boy is the subject, so the nominative case is used.

Genitive case

In grammar, the genitive case is the grammatical case used when talking about possession: something that belongs to someone. For example, in the sentence "the boy's bike was red," the bike belongs to the boy. The word "boy's" is in the genitive case. 

NuSTAR

NuSTAR is a telescope launched into space by NASA in 2012. It is the eleventh satellite in the "Small Explorer" program. Telescopes in space can see much better than on Earth, because the telescopes on Earth need to look through the atmosphere. 

NuSTAR measures high-energy X-rays, which have a much higher frequency than visible light. It uses special optical devices to do this, so it works differently from a normal telescope. This type of telescope is called a Wolter telescope.

NuSTAR is searching for black holes. It is also looking at supernovae to help understand how the chemical elements are created. One of the first discoveries made by NuSTAR, along with another space telescope called XMM-Newton, was to measure the spin rate of a supermassive black hole for the first time.

Carmelo Flores Laura

Carmelo Flores Laura (likely born July 16, 1906 – June 9, 2014) was a centenarian from Bolivia, who some believed to be born in 1890. That would have made him the person living to be the oldest ever known. However, other documents was found, that indicated he was actually born in 1906. Flores himself only said that he was about 100 years or more, which in that case was correct.

Laura was born on July 16, 1906 in Bolivia. 

Carmelo Flores Laura worked for the rancher who owned Frasquia, a rural area of Bolivia near Lake Titicaca, until 1952. At that time, the government seized the land and redistributed it to peasants such as Flores. He has lived there since, never traveling father than La Paz, from his home.

Flores had three children, one of which is alive as of 2013 (Cecilio, aged 67). He has 40 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren. His wife died in the 2000s. 

The Bolivian government was said to be planning to officially honor Flores as "a living heritage" of the Bolivian people.

A police ID card and entry in the civil registry stating Flores was born on July 16, 1890 were shown to reporters. The longest fully documented lifespan in history is 122 years and 164 days, achieved by France's Jeanne Calment. 

Flores himself only said "I should be about 100 years old or more," when asked about his age. The Gerontology Research Group found a baptismal certificate that indicated Flores was actually 107 years rather than 123.

Laura died in an Andean village in Bolivia, aged 107.

Bipolar junction transistor

A bipolar junction transistor (BJT or bipolar transistor) is a type of transistor that relies on the contact of two types of semiconductor in order for it to work. BJTs can be used as amplifiers, switches, or in oscillators. BJTs can be found either on their own, or in large numbers as parts of integrated circuits.

They are named "bipolar" transistors because their operation involves both electrons and holes.

The current gained is measured in h, Forward Current Gain. Typical amount can be between 200-350.


Death anniversary

A death anniversary is the custom of commemorating the date of someone's death. It is observed in several Asian cultures, including among Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Jewish and Vietnamese people. The tradition has also been associated with Confucianism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Judaism. Like a birthday, it is celebrated each year.

Darwin's finches

Darwin's finches, also known as the Galapagos finches, are finches that live on the Galápagos Islands. They are not actually finches, but they are a kind of passerine bird.

Charles Darwin used the finches to provide evidence for natural selection. He realized that the finches have different beaks because they are adapted to eat different kinds of food. For example, a finch with a big beak is very good at cracking open nuts, and a finch with a long beak is very good at catching insects. Darwin was able to see that the finches had a common ancestor which is why they were so similar except for their beaks. Eventually, this led to the theory of evolution.

Pico do Fogo

Pico do Fogo ("Fire peak") is the highest peak of Cape Verde, rising to above sea level. It is an active stratovolcano lying on the island of Fogo. The last eruption of the main volcanic cone was in 1675 and all the people living in the island had to leave.

A lateral vent (the opening of a volcano from which lava flows) erupted in 1995. The only deadly eruption was in 1847 when earthquakes produced in all the island claimed several lives. Volcanic lava has reached the eastern coast of the island in historical times.
Its most spectacular feature is a volcanic crater (or caldera, "caldeira" in Portuguese) that is about wide, with a border ("bordeira" in Portuguese) that is about high. The crater has a slit in its eastern wall, and a large peak like a volcanic cone rises in its center that. The central cone is the highest point of the island (2829 m) and its peak is about 100 m higher than the "bordeira" that surrounds the crater.

The lowest elevation of the floor of the "caldeira", known as "Chã das Caldeiras" ("Plain of the Calderas") is . There are, within the "caldeira", two villages which were evacuated during the last eruption. Traditionally, grapes are grown on the inner slopes of the "bordeira" and there is some subsistence agriculture on the "caldeira" floor.

The mountain's slopes are used to grow coffee, while its lava is used as building material.

The Fea's petrel ("Pterodroma feae"), a Near Threatened species of bird, breeds in this mountain.

The endemic plants "Echium vulcanorum" and "Erysimum caboverdeanum" are only known to occur on the outer rim of the volcano.

Geoffrey II of Anjou

Geoffrey II, called Martel ("the Hammer"), was a French nobleman who was the Count of Anjou from 1040 to 1060. He was the last count who was a male line descendant of Ingelger. The countship passed through his sister Ermengarde-Blanche of Anjou to her son Geoffrey III.

Geoffrey was born 14 October 1006. He was the son of Fulk the Black and Hildegard of Lorraine. As the count of Vendome, Geoffrey married Agnes of Burgundy. About 1038 Geoffrey was asked by Herbert Braco to help him against Gervais, the Bishop of Le Mans. During the short war between them Geoffrey broke his hip. This caused Geoffrey to have to transfer some of his vassals to Bishop Gervais.

At his father's death in 1040 Geoffrey Martel succeeded him. Along with king Henry I of France Geoffrey maintained a war against the count Theobald of Blois. As the power of Blois was reduced the power of Anjou increased. But Geoffrey became too powerful and by the late 1040s the king turned against him. 

About 1047 Geoffrey began to look to the north for more land. Geoffrey attacked the castle of Château-du-Loir owned by Bishop Gervais. He did not capture the castle but burned some of it. Geoffrey did capture Bishop Gervais who he threw in prison. The Council of Reims in 1049 ordered Geoffrey to release his captive bishop or they would excommunicate him. Even when the pope did excommunicate Geoffrey the following year he would not release the Bishop. 

Geoffrey next acquired the castles of Alençon and Domfront on the southern border of Normandy. From there he raided into Normandy. In 1051 Duke William moved against Domfront but was not able to defeat the fortress. William then set up a siege of the castle to force it to surrender. This caused Geoffrey to leave Maine and return to Anjou. 

In early 1052 a political shift occurred. King Henry I reconciled with Geoffrey Martel and about the same time he turned against Duke William of Normandy. 
In the same year, 1052, when the count of Maine, Hugh, died Geoffrey took over Maine without a fight. He ruled Maine until his death. Bishop Gervaise finally purchased his freedom from Geoffrey by giving him Château-du-Loir and promising not to return to Le Mans. Gervais went to the court of Duke William of Normandy. Another event in 1052 in Normandy would bring King Henry and Count Geoffrey together against William of Normandy. William of Arques, a vassal and relative of Duke William rebelled. In 1053 the king, along with Geoffrey of Anjou entered Normandy to assist William of Arques against Duke William. The duke had laid siege to the castle of Arques. But the relief effort failed and King Henry and count Geoffrey were forced to leave Normandy. In 1054 the King, accompanied by Geoffrey Martel again raided into Normandy. The king's brother, Odo, led a second force which attacked Normandy from the west. Odo's forces were defeated causing the king and count Geoffrey to leave Normandy again. 

In 1058 Geoffrey was visited by the king in Anjou. The two planned their next attacks on Normandy. In August of that year the two led a combined force into Normandy to pillage and burn what they could. At a crossing of the Dives River their force was caught by the rising tide. Geoffrey and the king were on the other side when the bulk of their army was attacked and defeated by Duke William. All Geoffrey and the king could do was leave Normandy as fast as they could. The king's death in the summer of 1060 and Geoffrey's death in November of that same year ended their wars.

Geoffrey II's first wife was Agnes of Burgundy, the widow of William V of Aquitaine; she and Geoffrey married in 1032, but had divorced by 1050. 

His second wife was named Grace. 

His third wife was Adèle, the daughter of a "Count Odo" of Blois.

His last wife was Adelaide "La Teutonne".

Geoffrey died childless.

Family International

Family International, which had been called The Children of God, The Family of Love and The Family, is a New Age religion, and a cult. It was started in the 1960s in California by David Brandt Berg (1919–1994).

The Children of God (1968–1977)

The Family of Love (1978–1981)

The Family (1982–1994)

Identified by Chinese government as a cult (1990s)

The Family International (2004 onwards)

Broadly, the Family are a Christian evangelical movement. However, their beliefs are selective. Their "spiritual revolution" is against the outside world, which the members called "the System". After the death of the founder, his widow Karen Zerby became the leader of TFI, taking the title of 'Queen' and 'prophetess.' She married Steve Kelly, an assistant of David Berg whom Berg had chosen as her 'consort' before his death. Steve Kelly took the title of 'King Peter' and became the public face of TFI, speaking in a more public capacity than either David Berg or Karen Zerby.

In 1974, the group began a method of evangelism called Flirty Fishing. This meant using sex to "show God's love" and win converts. The method was apparently extremely successful. According to TFI, as a result of Flirty Fishing, "over 100,000 received God's gift of salvation through Jesus, and some chose to live the life of a disciple and missionary".

The group encouraged children to have sex with adults and each other. The High Court of Justice, Family Division, in the UK found there to be "widespread sexual abuse of young children and teenagers by adult members of The Family". According to data provided by TFI to researcher Bill Bainbridge, from 1974 until 1987, members had sexual contact with 223,989 people while practicing Flirty Fishing. Flirty Fishing also resulted in the births of many children, including Karen Zerby's son, Davidito (aka Ricky Rodriguez). He committed suicide after murdering a female member of the cult who had sexually abused him as a toddler. Children born as result of Flirty Fishing were referred to as "Jesus Babies". By the end of 1981, more than 300 "Jesus Babies" had been born.

In his judgment of a child custody court case in England in 1994, after extensive research of COG publications and the testimony of numerous witnesses, Lord Justice Sir Alan Ward said this about Flirty Fishing:

Flirty Fishing was officially abandoned in 1987. After some complaints from people who had been abused as children by adults, a new rule, that sexual interactions should not occur between an adult and a minor, was encouraged and promoted, but not enforced.

In March 1989, TF issued a statement which stated that, in "early 1985" an urgent memorandum was sent to all of its members "reminding them that any such activities [adult-child sexual contact] are strictly forbidden within our group". In January 2005, Claire Borowik, spokesperson for TFI, issued a statement that said, "Due to the fact that our current zero-tolerance policy regarding sexual interaction between adults and underage minors was not clearly stated in our literature published before 1986, we came to the realization that during a transitional stage of our movement, from 1978 until 1986, there were cases when some minors were subject to sexually inappropriate advances... This was corrected officially in 1986, when any contact between an adult and minor (any person under 21 years of age) was declared an excommunicable offense".

Geoffrey III, Count of Anjou

Geoffrey III of Anjou (1040–1096), called "le Barbu" ("the Bearded"), was a French nobleman who was the Count of Anjou 1060-68.

Geoffrey III, born , was the oldest son of Geoffrey II, Count of Gâtinais and Ermengarde-Blanche of Anjou. Ermengarde-Blanche was the daughter of Fulk III of Anjou. Both he and his younger brother Fulk, called "le Réchin", were raised at the court of their uncle, Geoffrey Martel. Both Geoffrey and Fulk were knighted by him in 1060. Geoffrey was well treated by his uncle but the count may have favored his younger nephew, Fulk. Nonetheless Geoffrey became his heir to succeed him as count of Anjou. Geoffrey III reigned as Count of Anjou until the was taken from him by his brother, Fulk.

He succeeded his uncle Geoffrey Martel in 1060, but it soon became clear to his vassals he was not a very good count. Geoffrey Martel left his younger brother, Fulk, Saintonge as an appanage. In 1062, when Saintonge was attacked by Count Guy-Geoffrey of Poitou, Geoffrey did nothing to help Fulk and Saintonge was lost. In 1063 the county of Maine was lost to Anjou as well. In 1064 Geoffrey failed to come to the aid of one of his vassals, Rainaldus of Chateau-Gontier, who was captured by the Bretons. In 1065 Geoffrey angered Archbishop Barthelemy of Tours by trying to force his own choice for Bishop of Le Mans on the church. In turn the archbishop excommunicated Geoffrey. 

As the situation in Anjou became worse Fulk argued with his brother Geoffrey. Finally, in 1067, Fulk rebelled and took the county away from Geoffrey, briefly imprisoning him. In 1068 Geoffrey attacked Fulk, and once again he was defeated. This time Geoffrey was imprisoned where he remained for 28 years. Geoffrey was finally freed by the intervention of Pope Urban II in 1096. But Geoffrey died soon after his release.

Geoffrey married Julienne de Langeais before 1060. She died after 7 August 1067. They had no children. 

Ermengarde-Blanche of Anjou

Ermengarde-Blanche of Anjou (–1076), was a French noblewoman who was first Countess of Chateau-Landon and secondly Duchess of Burgundy. She is also called "Hermangarde" in some sources. Ermengarde-Blanch was the heiress of the of Anjou and is an of the House of Plantagenet. 

Ermengarde-Blanche was the daughter of Count Fulk III of Anjou and Hildegarde. She was involved in two marriage alliances that greatly benefited her father and brother as counts of Anjou. She was first contracted to marry Geoffrey II, Count of Gâtinais, called "Ferréol", who was also lord of Château-Landon. It was important marriage to return Château-Landon to the counts of Anjou. It took between twelve and eighteen months to arrange the marriage. Meanwhile Fulk paid a great deal of attention to Château-Landon. He and his wife, Hildegarde, founded the abbey of Le Ronceray. Originally a church dedicated to St. Mary, Hildegard was very active in its rebuilding into an abbey. They gave the abbey many gifts including the forest of Lattay. They gave more gifts to this abbey than any other church or religious house. Her two sons of this marriage, Geoffrey III and Fulk both became counts of Anjou after her brother Geoffrey II Martel. Among her descendants are the Plantagenet (or Angevin) kings of England.

After her husband Geoffrey died Ermengarde-Blanche married Robert I Capet, Duke of Burgundy. Robert was the son of King Robert II of France. Because both Ermengarde and her second husband Robert Capet were both descendants of Ingelger, they were related by blood. This was found in charts prepared at the of Saint-Aubin at Angers between 1048 and 1052. The charts show how closely the Angevin and Capet families were related. The charts were probably created over concerns of who Ermengarde and Robert's daughter Hildegarde could or could not marry. Ermengarde-Blanche died at Fleury-sur-Ouche on 18 March 1076. Robert died three days later at the same place on 21 March 1076.

Together she and Geoffrey II had the following children: 


She married secondly Robert I, Duke of Burgundy. Together they had a daughter:

It was set up for the 1906 election and is the local Indigenous Australian name for the Lachlan River, which runs through the western part of the division. (The name should be pronounced Kal-"ah"-ree, but the pronunciation Kul-"air" is used.)

The division includes the towns of Bathurst, Blayney, Canowindra, Eugowra, Forbes, Lithgow, Molong, Oberon, Orange, Parkes, Peak Hill, Portland, Wallerawang and Yeoval.

Peter Andren was not a candidate for the 2007 election as he was going to stand for a Senate seat. He was diagnosed with cancer in 2007 and died during the election campaign. John Cobb had previously held the seat of Parkes. He was Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs and Minister for Community Services in the Howard Government.


Division of Charlton

The Division of Charlton was an Australian Electoral Division in New South Wales. It was created in 1984 and was named for Matthew Charlton, leader of the Australian Labor Party 1922-28. It covered the Hunter Region area of New South Wales. It included the towns of Cardiff, Wallsend, Toronto, Morisset, Cooranbong, Glendale and Warners Bay.

In October 2015 the Australian Electoral Commission said the division would be renamed at the next election. Because of population changes New South Wales lost one division, and a new one was created in Western Australia. To abolish the seat, the boundaries in New South Wales were redrawn. The old Division of Hunter was to be abolished. Since Hunter is an original Federation electorate, the Australian Electoral Commission's guidelines for redistributions means it has to try and keep the Hunter name. The area of Hunter was moved eastward and took over Charlton's former area.

Greg Combet had been Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). He was Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency in the Gillard Government. In the 2013 election, the Liberal Party candidate, Kevin Baker, resigned after being involved with an offensive website. This happened after nominations closed, so the Liberal Party could not select a new candidate and Baker's name was still on the ballot papers.

Harmonic analysis

Harmonic analysis is a branch of mathematics that looks at the theoretical foundations of digital signal processing. A continuous signal can be drawn as a wave, or as a combination of several waves. Fourier transforms and Fourier series are among the main tools used for signal analysis. Today, this field has many uses, which also include quantum mechanics and neuroscience. 

In essence, harmonic analysis looks at locally compact groups. The Lebesgue measure is a way to assign a measurement to a subset of the Euclidean space. For real numbers there is the Haar measure, which can perform this task. This measure allows to use Fourier analysis to model the groups and their properties. 

The term "harmonics" is also related to Eigenvalues, in the case where the frequency of one wave is an integer multiple of the frequency of another wave. This is the case of the harmonics that are used for musical notes. Later the term was generalized.

Frank Kameny

Franklin Edward "Frank" Kameny (May 21, 1925 – October 11, 2011) was an important person in the American gay rights movement. 

Kameny was born on May 21, 1925 in New York City, New York. He studied at Richmond Hill High School and at Queens College.

In 1957, Kameny was fired from his position as an astronomer in the U.S. Army's Army Map Service in Washington, D.C. because of his homosexuality. This helped him to begin "a Herculean struggle with the American establishment" that would help a rights movement of the early 1960s for homosexuals.

Kameny protested his firing by the U.S. Civil Service Commission due to his homosexuality, and argued this case to the United States Supreme Court in 1961. Although the court denied his petition, it is notable as the first civil rights claim based on sexual orientation. 

Kameny died on October 11, 2011 in Washington, D.C. from heart disease. He was 86 years old.

Following Kameny's death, the giant rainbow flag on the tall flagpole at the corner of Market Street and Castro Street in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco was flown at half-staff for 24 hours beginning on the afternoon of October 12, 2011 at the request of the creator of the rainbow flag, Gilbert Baker.

On November 2, 2011, Kameny's house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

On July 3 2012, Minor Planet (40463) "Frankkameny" was named in Kameny's honor by the International Astronomical Union and the Minor Planet Center.

Dota 2

Dota 2 is a video game that was released in 2013. It is a sequel to "Defense of the Ancients". Dota was originally a player-made map (also know as a mod) in "" that proved to be successful with over 5 million active players. When "Warcraft: Frozen Throne" game got old, it was hard to continue game development. As a result, Valve Corporation, with the help of the original maker (Icefrog) started to develop "Dota 2". We do not know the real name of Icefrog (which is an alias). Blizzard sued Valve over the copyright of Dota and lost.

The game is a hard to learn, hard to master strategy game. You map pick one of the 115 heroes. They're then put to two teams of five: one called the Radiant(Green) and the other, Dire(Red). The map contains three lanes called top, middle and bottom lanes. Usually, the team chooses to go 2-1-2(2 in top, 1 mid and 2 bot). Sometimes, it will be 2-1-1 or 1-1-2 because there will be a roamer. A roamer, as the name applies, goes all over the map where they can help.

'Creeps' spawn in both sides are called 'Minions' waves. They are controlled by the computer and they will attack the enemy creeps. They will target a hero or a tower if there is no creeps. The creeps are essential into winning the game since they give gold if killed by a hero.

In every lane, there are 3 towers. They're named by their tiers with tier 1 being the nearest to the enemies and tier 3 the farthest. You must destroy all the lane's towers before you can damage the barracks. The barracks are behind the tier 3 towers. If you destroy the 'Ranged Barracks' or 'Melee Barracks', the corresponding creeps spawn at the lane will be more powerful. If all 6 barracks get destroyed, all the creeps get boosted to Mega Creeps. Mega creeps are so powerful that an entire wave of them is equal to the power of a hero. If you have mega creeps, you will likely win the game.

The winning condition of the game is by destroying the enemy 'Ancient' or base while defending your own. Due to the large map and variety of scenarios,

games often last 30–50 minutes. Some games go to 2 hours if necessary. Players can also earn medals, which are displayed on their profile and represent their highest achieved rank during the current season. Each season lasts six months, and at the end of the season, players' ranks and medals are reset based on their performance in calibration matches.

You may leave the game before it ends, but you will get punished. Your next 1-5 games will be in a 'Low Priority' form. In low priority, every player gets a pool of only 3 heroes to pick. They can also not play with 'High Priority' players.

The game has two different teams with five "heroes" on each side. They can choose between 115 different heroes. Players have to get the rivaled towers in order to eventually get to the ancient and destroy it. Through the game, players can gain gold, buy items and of course, get kills and assists.

You can also play custom games, which are made by loyal players via the steam workshop. Dota 2 is famous for its complexity and forceful effort. Some people have earned millions of dollars playing this game in important hostages, most knowingly, the International, which has the biggest money pool in video game history, reaching 13 million in U.S.A dollars.

Echium vulcanorum

Echium vulcanorum is a plant species that belongs to the Boraginaceae family, the borage family. It is found only in the Fogo island, Cape Verde.

It was discovered and named by the French botanist Auguste Jean Baptiste Chevalier. He found the plant with flowers on July 1934.

It is locally known as "lingua de vaca" ("tongue of cow") because their leaves are rough. The same name is used for the other species of "Echium" that are found in Cape Verde: "Echium hypertropicum" and "Echium stenosiphon".

It is a shrub with many branches, up to 1.5–2 m tall. The stems are covered with many hairs. The leaves are lanceolates (pointed at both ends) up to 10 cm long and 1.5 wide.

The flowers are in dense inflorescences (groups of flowers), almost conical, up to 18 cm long, with white flowers with blue stripes.

"Echium vulcanorum" is endemic of the Cape Verdean island of Fogo on the volcano "Pico do Fogo". It occurs on volcanic soils of Fogo Island, mainly as two populations at Monte Losna/Pico Novo, where they can be found at about 1700 m, and in the border of the crater of the "Pico do Fogo" (the "Bordeira" region ) at altitudes between 2200 and 2400 m. A small population was also reported in "Chã das Caldeiras" (±1600 m). These populations exist generally in places facing to the southwest or the southeast. It prefers soils with a recent volcanic origin.

"Echium vulcanorum" is used for the production of (dry wood that will be burned) and destroyed by goats, so this species, as well as the other two "Echium" species of Cape Verde, is seriously threatened, so that measures for its protection should be taken with urgency.

Some conservation actions have been done at the "Bordeira region" (in the Natural Park of Fogo Island) and now there is a population with a relatively high number of individuals.

There are three apocryphal books attributed to Enoch, the most popular of which is 1 Enoch, also known as the Book of Enoch, a pseudepigraphical work, which means Enoch himself never wrote it. In the New Testament, Enoch is mentioned in the Gospel of Luke, the Epistle to the Hebrews, and the Epistle of Jude.

Enoch is first mentioned in the Book of Genesis as the seventh of the ten Patriarchs who lived before the flood; each patriarch lived for several centuries. Genesis 5 gives us a genealogy of these ten figures (from Adam to Noah), giving us information on the age at which each fathered the next and the age of each figure when they died. But for Enoch, he is an exception; he did "not see death" (). says that Enoch lived for 365 years, which is shorter than any other patriarch who lived before the flood; they are all said to be dying at over 700 years of age. The account of Enoch in Genesis 5 ends with the cryptic note that "he was not; for God took him". This happened 57 years after Adam's death and 69 years before Noah's birth.

Enmeduranki was an ancient Sumerian king who is said to have been a Mesopotamian model for Enoch, he lived before the ancient Egyptian dynasties ruling from about 3400 BC. Enmeduranki appears as the seventh name on the Sumerian King List, whereas Enoch is the seventh figure on the list of patriarchs in Genesis. Both of them were also said to have been taken up into heaven. Sippar, the city of Enmeduranki, has been said to be connected with sun worship, while the 365 years that Enoch is said to have lived may have formed the number of days in the solar calendar.

The New Testament mentions Enoch three times.

Pupusa

A pupusa is a thick griddle cake or flatbread from the cuisine of El Salvador is a traditional food made with corn flour, beans, cheese, chicharrón (pork), or any filling. People usually eat pupusas at breakfast and dinner. It is eaten with tomato sauce and curtido.

Pupusas - also known as pupisio - were first created by the Pipil in El Salvador. Over time cooking material for their preparation have been found in Joya de Cerén, “El Salvador’s Pompeii”, place of a native small town that was buried by ashes from a volcano explosion, and where foodstuffs were preserved as they were being cooked almost two thousand years ago by the tribes. The articles for their preparation have also been found in other archaeological sites in El Salvador.

Depending on what city people visit, they’ll find different types of Pupusas. if they go to the coast side, they’ll find Pupusas filled with shrimp and fish. Pupusas can be also filled with different types of flowers like “flor de Izote” (El Salvador national flower), lorocco, Cucurbita argyrosperma, cilantro, Chamaedorea tepejilote, chipilín, mora, chicken, and papelillo.

There are various types of Pupusas in El Salvador alone. From the way the dough is made to the preparation and even the fillings that are used, each place and pupuseria can have their own take on making a pupusa. On the other hand, El Salvador, a pupusa de arroz is also a popular variant. It is made from rice flour instead of cornmeal. Of course pupusas are not always going to taste the same, depending on what type of dough people make them with. Pupusas might taste a little different when using commercial corn or rice flour instead of masa harina (dried cornmeal flour) that Salvadorians use.

Manila hostage crisis

The Manila hostage crisis (Tagalog: Pagbibihag ng bus sa Maynila; Chinese: 馬尼拉人質事件) happened on August 23, 2010. A man who had been fired from the Philippine National Police, Rolando del Rosario Mendoza, boarded a tourist bus in Rizal Park and took the passengers hostages. Nine people (including 8 tourists from Hong Kong, killed by Mendoza, and Mendoza himself) were killed in the incident.

Since some Hong Kong people blamed the Philippine Government for not handling the incident properly, the relationship between Hong Kong and the Philippines had become much worse.

Rolando del Rosario Mendoza was formerly a policeman. In 2008, he was fired because of complaints that he forced an arrested chef to admit drug trafficking that he had not done.

When he came aboard the tourist bus, he posted a sticker to the bus stating "BIG MISTAKE TO CORRECT A BIG WRONG DECISION".

The tour group was held by Hong Thai Travel. It set off on 20 August. The day when the incident happen was the last day of the tour. That day was also the Ghost Festival of China.

 "Note that the time mentioned in this chapter is 8 hours faster than the UTC."

About 10 o'clock, Mendoza boarded the bus. At that time, he let the tour guide and the hostage contact their households. The tour guide, Tse Ting Chunn, phoned the Assistant Manager, "依家有咗好大鑊嘅問題……有個軍人上咗我部車挾持咗我哋成部車，佢有兩把槍。(There is a serious incident. A solider came apart our bus and took us as hostage. He has two gun.)" The manager told him to make the tourist be calm.

At 2 pm, a younger brother of Mendoza came. A police officer took his gun. Mendoza got angry and shouted. At 9 pm, he started killing the tourists. First, he killed the tour guide. Next, he shot at Yik Siu Ling. She pretended to be dead. Then, some of the tourists decided to subdue him, but they were shot. After that, he kept on shooting at the tourists.

About 7 pm, The Philippine National Police signed the reinstatement order of Mendoza. However, because of the traffic jam, the document wasn't deliver to him on time. When the document was delivered, he had already killed many tourists.

The tour guide and six tourists who were shot by Mendoza died. Mendoza was shot dead by the police afterwards. Seven tourists were hurt. Some of them underwent surgery. Mike Yadrillo y Campanero, a citizen in the Philippines and a staff of TVB were also injured during the shootings.

The government of the Philippines agreed that the killed tourists were murdered.

On 5 November 2013, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, CY Leung, has claimed that if no progress are made in a month, there will be sanctions against the Philippines.

On 29 January 2014, Hong Kong has canceled visa-free privileges for Philippine officials. However, Aquino III, the president of the Philippines, still refuses to apologize for the incident.

The official website of Bulacan, a city of the Philippines, was hacked. The background music was changed to the national anthem of the People's Republic of China and text was added which requested the government to apologize.

After the accident, some of the bodies of the killed tourists had been mixed up. Also, the staff of the funeral house opened the coffins and let journalists take photos. Such events made the Hong Kong people very more angry. Ironically, Mendoza's funeral was held at his home and his coffin was covered by the national flag of the Philippines. This added anger to the people of Hong Kong. A "netizen" of Hong Kong even joked that the Philippine flag could be used as doormat.

The Philippine Government said that the flag was used improperly. They had already asked the households of Mendoza to remove the flag.

Tse Ting Chunn, the tour guide, was buried in Diamond Hill Crematorium. Three tourist were buried at St. Raphael's Catholic Cemetery temporarily. The others were buried in Tribute Garden.

The Philippine Police were criticized for the followings:

When a injured tourist was on an ambulance, he asked for a bandage. However, a nurse told him to cover the wound himself.

Another injured tourist was sent to the Manila Doctors Hospital. However, a guard didn't let her in. Finally, when she was being transferred to the Manila City Hospital, she died.

The Government had set up public places for mourning, and also a Facebook page.。

Mourning masses were held in churches.

Many websites of Hong Kong turned their logos gray. "A Symphony of Lights", a firework and light show held every evening at 8:00 pm in Hong Kong was suspended.

A joint demonstration march was held by the policial parties such as the Democratic Party, the Civic Party, Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, and Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong.

On 25 August, different religious organizations held Puja and mass. Upajjhayas of Fo Guang Shan, a Taiwanese temple, prayed for peace. The Archbishop of Manila led a prayer and 200 police officers lit candles for the dead in a mourning ceremony.

Fernando Chui Sai On, chief executive of Macau, wrote a condolence letter to Donald Tsang, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong then. The Encyclopedia of Virtual Communities in Macau turned its logo gray.

In 2013, household of the died tour guide and some of the injured filed a petition to the High Court. The petition is against the government of the Philippines, former mayor of Manila and 7 other units.

Two of the injured also filed a petition, but it was against Hong Thai Travel.

At 21:45 on 23 August 2008, Security Bureau had raised the Outbound Travel Alert for the Philippines to Black.

In the first two months after the incident, 4000 pesos of tourist receipts were lost. In August 2010, about 12,000 tourists were from Hong Kong. However, in September, there were only about 7000 tourists from Hong Kong.

Jackie Chan, an actor, said that Hong Kong people had forgiven the Philippine Police. Many "netizens" in Hong Kong disagreed his comment and condemned him. Later, his blog had an entry about his own café in the Philippines welcomed by the Philippine policemen. He later apologized.

One year after the crime, Wong Koon Chung, a singer, said that he would support killing the Philippine President Aquino III and cursing him with foul language. He later took back his speech.

A Hong Kong TV station, TVB, played "Can't Buy Me Love", a comedy, after the live show of the hostage incident. TVB had received complaints afterwards.

However, there were comments that comedies could make the audience relaxed.





Graphic designer

Graphic designer is a professional related with Graphic design's and Graphic art's industry. They build piece of designs through assembling typography and motion graphics(animation). Mainly graphic designers creates graphics for published, printed, or electronic media, such as brochures (sometimes) and advertising usages. Sometimes they are also part of typesetting, illustration, user interface construction and web designs. They are presenting information as accessible and memorable form.

A Bachelor's degree or certificate from accredited trade school is considered as usually essential for the position as a graphic designer. After a career history has been established, though, the graphic designer's experience and number of years in the business are considered the primary qualifications. A portfolio, which is the primary method for demonstrating these qualifications, is usually required to be shown at job interviews, and is constantly developed throughout a designer's career.

One can obtain an AAS, BA, BFA, BCA, MFA or an MPhil / PhD in graphic design. Degree programs available vary depending upon the institution. Although typical U.S. graphic design jobs may require at least some form of degree.
Current graphic designer jobs demand proficiency in one or more graphic design software programs. A common software package used in the graphic design industry is Adobe Creative Cloud. This software package contains the three main programs used by graphic designers, which are Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. These are the industry standard applications for many graphic design positions. Another example of a common software package is CorelDraw Graphics Suite.

Outside the graphic design industry, many people use Microsoft Word or Microsoft Publisher to create a layout or design. However, depending on the job at hand, most designers create the layout in either InDesign, CorelDraw, or QuarkXPress. Specifically, the designer will type or import the text in the layout program, also importing the graphics and images they created in Photoshop or Illustrator. There are a couple of reasons a designer builds a layout in this fashion:

Files going to press are generally printed at 300 dots per inch. As a result, the file size can become very large, depending upon the photos and graphics used in it. By using a layout program and linking these graphics and images (but not saving all of them in the file itself), the working file is a fraction of the file size. When the designer is ready to go to press, s/he will either create a press-ready PDF; or use the "Package" function in InDesign, or the "Collect For Output" function in QuarkXpress or CorelDRAW (which gathers the layout document, plus all fonts and images used therein, and saves them in one folder which can be provided to a commercial printing company for final output).
InDesign, CorelDRAW, or QuarkXPress make it possible to work with large multiple page layouts, such as catalogs and booklets.
Since InDesign, CorelDRAW, and QuarkXPress the original file, linking to the graphics and images, the designer can change the "original file" and it will update all instances throughout the document to save time.
A web designer should understand how to work with XML, HTML, and basic web programming scripts. A print designer should understand the processes involved in printing (including, notably, offset printing) to be able to produce press-ready artwork.
Designers should be able to solve visual communication problems or challenges. In doing so, the designer must identify the communications issue, gather and analyze information related to the issue, and generate potential approaches aimed at solving the problem. Iterative prototyping and user testing can be used to determine the success or failure of a visual solution. Approaches to a communications problem are developed in the context of an audience and a media channel. Graphic designers must understand the social and cultural norms of that audience in order to develop visual solutions that are perceived as relevant, understandable and effective.
Graphic designers should also have a thorough understanding of production and rendering methods. Some of the technologies and methods of production are drawing, offset printing, photography, and time-based and interactive media (film, video, computer multimedia). Frequently, designers are also called upon to manage color in different media.

She asked for the votes to be recounted and she won by 12 votes The result was challenged in the High Court of Australia and was referred to the Federal Court of Australia. Seven months later, and after carefully checking 643 individual votes, the court found Bailey had won by 31 votes. Later Bailey called for big changes the voting system.

Fran Bailey was Minister for Employment Services, Assistant Minister for Defence, and later Minister for Small Business and Tourism during the Howard Government.


Santorini caldera

Santorini caldera is a large, mostly submerged caldera. It is in Greece, in the southern Aegean Sea, 120 kilometers north of Crete. Visible above water is the circular Santorini island group.

The caldera measures about , with high steep cliffs on three sides. There are two small volcanic islands at the center of the caldera, Nea ("New") Kameni and Palea ("Old") Kameni. The main island, Santorini has an area of km2.

The extraordinary beauty of Santorini's high walls, draped by whitewashed villages, combined with a sunny climate and clear air, have made it a magnet for tourists and volcanologists. 

The volcanic complex of Santorini is the most active part of the South Aegean Volcanic Arc. This marks the subduction of the African tectonic plate underneath the Aegean part of the Eurasian tectonic plate, at a rate of up to 5 cm per year in a northeasterly direction. It has earthquakes at depths of 150–170 km.

Non-volcanic rocks are exposed on Santorini at the Profitis Ilias Mountain, Mesa Vouno, the Gavrillos ridge, Pirgos, Monolithos and the inner side of the caldera wall between Cape Plaka and Athinios.

The Kameni islands at the center of the caldera are made of lava rocks.

The caldera is composed of overlapping shield volcanoes, cut by at least four partially overlapping calderas, of which the oldest southern caldera was formed about 180,000 years ago. The subsequent Skaros caldera was created about 70,000 years ago, and the Cape Riva caldera about 21,000 years ago. The current caldera was formed about 3600 years ago during the Minoan eruption.

Palea Kameni and Nea Kameni were formed as a result of multiple, initially submarine eruptions at the center of the caldera.

Although dormant, Santorini is an active volcano. Numerous minor and medium-sized, mainly effusive eruptions have built the dark-colored lava shields of Nea and Palea Kameni inside the caldera.

Their last eruption was in 1950, and now only smoke and gases come out. GPS instruments have registered renewed deformation around the caldera in 2011 and 2012. 

The huge Minoan eruption of Santorini in the 17th century BC may have inspired the legend of Atlantis. It was rated 7, the highest score for a historical eruption, in the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program's Volcanic Explosivity Index.

Coptic language

Coptic or Coptic Egyptian is an Egyptian language. It was spoken by many people in Egypt until at least the 17th century. Now, only a few people speak the language.

Egyptian began to be written using the Greek alphabet in the 1st century. The new writing system became the Coptic script, an adapted Greek alphabet with the addition of six or seven signs from the demotic script to represent Egyptian sounds the Greek language did not have. The two most common dialects are Sahidic and Bohairic.

Coptic and demotic Egyptian are very similar to the earlier Egyptian language written in the hieroglyphic script. Coptic flourished as a literary language from the 2nd to 13th centuries, and its Bohairic dialect continues to be the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. It was supplanted by Egyptian Arabic as a spoken language toward the early modern period. The Copts have tried to revive the language since the 19th century.

Richard Warren

Richard Warren (ca. 1580 - ca.1628) was a passenger on the "Mayflower" on its 1620 voyage from the Old World to the New. He was one of the 41 signers of the Mayflower Compact.

His descendants in the United States are legion and include many notable Americans: 


Brian Sims

Brian Kendall Sims (born September 16, 1978) is an American Democratic politician and football captain. He was the first college American football captain to come out as gay. He is also the first openly gay person elected to the Pennsylvania General Assembly. He was a candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania in the 2022 election.

Sims's parents were both colonels in the U.S. Army. He has a twin brother, an older brother, and a younger sister. He went to high school in Chester County, Pennsylvania.

Sims has a bachelor of science degree from Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania. He also has a juris doctor degree from the Michigan State University College of Law.

At Bloomsburg, Sims was the captain of the 2000 National Championship Division II football team. He was a first-string defensive tackle. He became the only openly gay college football captain in NCAA history.

Sims was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, 182nd District. Sims was the first openly gay person elected to the Pennsylvania General Assembly.

In June 2013, the Defense of Marriage Act was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Sims was not allowed to make a speech supporting the decision in the Pennsylvania House. House Speaker Daryl Metcalfe, a Republican, said that allowing him to speak would be a violation of God's law.
In May 2019, Sims posted an eight minute video of himself confronting a woman who was protesting outside a Planned Parenthood facility in Philadelphia by praying with a rosary. On May 15, 2019 he was served a summons for federal case 5:19-cv-00834 at his office on Chestnut Street. On July 15, 2019 at 3:00 PM the Default judgement entered on June 18, 2019 was used as collateral for trying to help Hahnemann Hospital stay open case # 19-11466 Delaware Bankruptcy Court.

On February 15, 2021 Sims announced on Twitter that he was running for lieutenant governor in the 2022 election. He lost the Democratic nomination in May 2022 to Austin Davis.

Gyrocompass

A gyrocompass is a type of compass that does not use magnetism to point north. Normal compasses do not work around magnets, or big pieces of ferrous metal. Gyrocompasses do. This makes them very useful.

A gyrocompass is a non-magnetic compass based on a fast-spinning disc and the rotation of the Earth It automatically finds geographical direction. 

Although one part of a gyrocompass is a gyroscope, these are not the same devices. A crucial ingredient is needed to turn a gyroscope into a gyrocompass, so it would automatically position to true north. This is some mechanism that applies torque whenever the compass's axis is not pointing north. Successful methods have two significant advantages over magnetic compasses:

Division of McMillan

The Division of McMillan was an Australian Electoral Division in the state of Victoria. It covered the western part of the Gippsland region. It included Drouin, Erica, Foster, Inverloch, Korumburra, Leongatha, Mirboo North, Moe, Neerim South, Newborough, Nyora, Pakenham, Trafalgar, Walhalla, Warragul, Wonthaggi, Yallourn North and Yarragon. It was the southernmost electoral division in continental Australia. It was replaced by the Division of Monash in 2019.

The Division was set up in 1949, and named after Angus McMillan, one of the first Europeans to explore the Gippsland region. 

In 1972 Country Party candidate Arthur Hewson won the seat with a primary vote of 16.6%. This is the lowest primary vote for a winning candidate in any federal election.

From 1943–1949 he was Minister for Labour and National Service. Frank Crean was Treasurer and Minister for Trade in the Whitlam Government. In 1975 he was Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. Clyde Holding had been the Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian Parliament. He held several positions in the Hawke Government including Aboriginal Affairs, Employment Services and Youth Affairs, Transport and Communications Support, Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs.



Coburger Hütte

The Coburger Hütte is a mountain refuge in Tyrol, Austria. It is in the Mieminger Chain in Tyrol. It is a few meters above the Drachensee and 200 meters from Seebensee. Tourist accommodation is usually open from June to early October. A winter room is available. Its altitude is 1917 meters. From there, mountain climbers can make a few other climbs (including Sonnenspizte, Taja-Kopf, Hinterer).

Seebensee

The Seebensee is a lake in Austria. It is at above the Ehrwalder Alm in Mieminger. It is in the east of Middle Tajakopf. The Seebensee has a drain on the Seebenbachfall and Geißbach in the Loisach. From Seebensee, people can climb up to Coburger Hütte. The location is known for its cows and its unofficial mascot Ben the Seebensee Cow.

Lady with an Ermine

Lady with an Ermine (Portrait of Cecilia Gallerani) ( ; ) is a painting by Leonardo da Vinci. It was painted between 1489 and 1490. The subject of the portrait is Cecilia Gallerani, the mistress of Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. Cecilia was pregnant at the time of the portrait. Leonardo was in the service of the Duke, who's nickname was 'white ermine'. The ermine was a symbol of purity for Leonardo. The painting was done in three stages and we know this because it went under reflective light technology and a multi lens camera was used. The first was a portrait just of Cecillia, the second he added a thin, small ermine and in the final stage, Leonardo made the ermine look more powerful and muscular. "Lady with an Ermine" is displayed in the Czartoryski Museum, Kraków, Poland. 


Mixed forest

Mixed forests are a temperate and humid biome. The forests have four layers. The uppermost layer is the forest canopy of tall, mature trees from 33 to 66 m (100 to 200 feet) high. 

Below the canopy is the three-layered understory, about 9 to 15 m (30 to 50 feet) shorter than the canopy. The top layer of the understory has smaller mature trees, saplings. There are also suppressed juvenile canopy layer trees waiting for an opening in the canopy. Below the sub-canopy is the shrub layer of low-growing woody plants. Most of the time, the lowest growing (and most diverse) layer is the ground cover or herbaceous layer.

Ancient woodland

Ancient woodland is the name used in the United Kingdom for woodland which has existed continuously since 1600 or before in England and Wales (or 1750 in Scotland). Before those dates, planting of new woodland was uncommon, so a wood present in 1600 was likely to have developed naturally. The American name for these forests is "old growth forest".

For many species of animal and plant, ancient woodland sites provide the only habitat. For many others, conditions on these sites are much more suitable than those on other sites. Ancient woodland in the UK, like rainforest in the tropics, is home to rare and threatened species, more than any other UK habitat. For these reasons ancient woodland is often described as an irreplaceable resource, or 'critical natural capital'.

Ancient woodland is formally defined on maps by Natural England and equivalent bodies. Many ancient woodlands have legal protection, but an ancient woodland is not automatically protected. 


Bluebell wood

A bluebell wood is a woodland that in springtime has a carpet of flowering bluebells ("Hyacinthoides non-scripta") underneath a newly forming leaf canopy. The thicker the summer canopy, the more the ground-cover is suppressed. This encourages a dense carpet of bluebells, whose leaves mature and die down by early summer.

Bluebell woods may be found in all parts of Great Britain and Ireland, as well as elsewhere in Europe. Bluebells are a common indicator species for ancient woodlands, so bluebell woods are likely to date back to at least 1600.

Gerard Manley Hopkins, one of the romantic poets, was very keen on bluebells, as his poem "May Magnificat" shows.
<poem>And azuring-over greybell makes
Wood banks and brakes wash wet like lakes</poem>

In his journal entry for 9 May 1871 Hopkins says:

In the little wood opposite the light they stood in blackish spreads or sheddings like spots on a snake. The heads are then like thongs and solemn in grain and grape-colour. But in the clough through the light they come in falls of sky-colour washing the brows and slacks of the ground with vein-blue, thickening at the double, vertical themselves and the young grass and brake-fern combed vertical, but the brake struck the upright of all this with winged transomes. It was a lovely sight. - The bluebells in your hand baffle you with their inscape, made to every sense. If you draw your fingers through them they are lodged and struggle with a shock of wet heads; the long stalks rub and click and flatten to a fan on one another like your fingers themselves would when you passed the palms hard across one another, making a brittle rub and jostle like the noise of a hurdle strained by leaning against; then there is the faint honey smell and in the mouth the sweet gum when you bite them.

Ardennes

Ardennes might mean:


Ardennes (forest)

The Ardennes (also known as Ardennes Forest) is a mountain range in eastern Belgium (eastern Wallonia), northern Luxembourg (the Oesling) and bordering France (Ardennes (department)).

It consist of hills of an altitude up to nearly 700 meters. It has many forests and few people.

The Ardennes are primarily made of slate, and borders in the east at the German Eifel. Important river is the Meuse.

Ginevra de' Benci

Ginevra de' Benci is an oil on wood painting by Leonardo da Vinci. The painting was made by Leonardo between 1479 and 1480. It hangs in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. It is the only Leonardo painting on view in the United States.

Auguste Jean Baptiste Chevalier

Auguste Jean Baptiste Chevalier was a French botanist, and explorer of tropical Africa, especially of French Africa and Côte d'Ivoire.
Chevalier was born on 23 June 1873 in Domfront, a town in Orne, Lower Normandy, France. His family had a small farm in Normandy and he studied first in Domfront and then in Caen.

He finished high school in 1891 and began to study at Caen University and, in 1893, Élie Antoine Octave Lignier, botanist at the university, put him in charge of making the catalog of the university herbarium.

After his military service in 1894, he got his degree in natural sciences in 1896 and he began to work with the botanist Charles Eugene Bertrand at the University of Lille. In 1897, he got a scholarship, allowing him to enter the botanical laboratory of Philippe Van Tieghem at the National Museum of Natural History. From 1899 to 1900, he was part of a scientific travel to Sudan.

Chevalier got a doctorate in 1901 and then made many scientific travels, mainly to Africa but also to tropical Asia and to South America. He became an assistant in the Colonial Agriculture Laboratory of the "École pratique des hautes études" (an establishment of research and higher education); in 1907 he became the deputy director of the institution and then in 1912 was made director of it.

In 1921, he began publishing the journal "Revue de Botanique Appliquée", in French, where he wrote many articles.

In 1929 he was made professor of crop production at the National Museum of Natural History of France; he remained here until his retirement in 146. He became a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1937.

After his death in 1956, the Domfront municipality gave his name to the high school of the city in 1959.

Fatin Shidqia

Fatin Shidqia Lubis (born in Jakarta, 30 July 1996) is an Indonesian singer. She won the talent show "X Factor Indonesia".


Oh! Susanna

"Oh! Susanna" is a song by Stephen Foster. It was Foster's first hit song. The song debuted in the Eagle Ice Cream Saloon in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on September 11, 1847 and was published by W. C. Peters of Cincinnati, Ohio in 1848. It became the unofficial anthem of the California Gold Rush in 1849.

Foster had little appreciation of the worth of his songs. His brother Morrison wrote: "While in Cincinnati [Stephen] wrote "Oh, Susanna", a song which soon became famous ... There was then in Cincinnati in the music business, W. C. Peters, whom Stephen had known in Pittsburgh, and who had taught music in our family ... [Stephen] made a present of "Old Uncle Ned" and "Oh, Susanna" to Mr. Peters. The latter made ten thousand dollars out of them, and established a music publishing house which became the largest in the West. The fame of these two songs went around the world, and thousands sang and played them who never heard the name of the author or whence they came."


Pilliga forest

The State Forests of The Pilliga, also called the Pilliga Scrub, covers an area of 3000 km in north-central New South Wales, Australia. It is the largest area of semi-arid woodland in the state. The forest is near the towns of Baradine and Narrabri and the villages of Pilliga and Gwabegar.

Author Eric Rolls wrote a book about the Pilliga called "A Million Wild Acres." He argued that the forest used to be an open woodland forest and that European influence has let the cypress pines take over. However, many scientific authors now disagree, using historical records from as early as the 1870s which say that the types of plants in the forest have not changed as much as Rolls suggests. However most of his history of the region is an important document for understanding the area.

The geology of the area is mainly Pilliga sandstone. This is a coarse red to yellow Jurassic sandstone containing about 75% quartz, 15% plagioclase and 10% iron oxide.In the south are sandstone outcrops with basalt-capped ridges. In the north there are plains of alluvium from flooding creeks. There are small, shallow, usually dry lakes, called gilgais, in some areas. In the west there are dry sandy creeks, called "sand monkeys". In the east is a heavily eroded sandstone mountain range, which can be seen as sandstone outcrops such as those around Gin's Leap between Baan Baa and Boggabri.

The forest contains at least 900 plant species. Some areas of the forest, particularly in the western Pilliga, are dominated by cypress-pine ("Callitris" spp.). However there are a variety of other plant communities in the forest, some of which do not include "Callitris". These include smaller she-oaks, while eucalypts are the taller trees throughout the forest.

Animals found in the Pilliga Nature Reserve include at least 36 native and nine introduced mammals, 50 reptiles and at least 15 frogs. Squirrel Gliders, Koalas, Rufous Bettongs and Pilliga Mice are present.

A 4909 km area of land, including the forest and the nearby Warrumbungle National Park, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). It supports groups of Painted Honeyeaters and Diamond Firetails. Endangered Swift Parrots and Regent Honeyeaters, and near threatened Bush Stone-curlews, are sometimes seen in the forest. Other woodland birds present in good numbers include Barking Owls, Glossy Black-Cockatoos, Grey-crowned Babblers, Speckled Warblers, Brown Treecreepers, Hooded Robins and Turquoise Parrots.

Fire plays a major role in the ecology of the forest with many plant species needing fire to regenerate. Sometimes the fires can be extremely hot, spread very quickly and threaten nearby properties as well as laying waste to entire ecosystems. If these fires occur less than 15 years apart there can be a loss of plant and animal biodiversity. The size of the Pilliga bushfires is linked to the El Nino Southern Oscillation phenomena, with El Nino (dry) years having the most severe fires.

In 1997 a major fire burned about 1,435 km² of the forest. An extremely dry winter and spring in 2006 saw a number of large fires develop, including the Pilliga 4 Fire in November/December which burned out 740 km² on its first day.

There many roads in the forest, many of which are former forestry roads. There used to be a large forestry industry, cutting cypress pine and ironbarks. In 2005 the NSW government protected much of the forest for environmental conservation.

There are many attractions in the forest, including:

Beautiful Dreamer

"Beautiful Dreamer" is a song by Stephen Foster written about 1862. It was first published (posthumously) in 1864 by William A. Pond & Co. It has been promoted as Foster's last song, but that distinction cannot be confirmed. It is similar in some respects to his first published song, "Open They Lattice, Love". Both have a triple rhythm and share imagery of the sea and marine life. 

The arpeggiated accompaniment recalls bel canto opera. The dreamer in this song is either asleep or dead. The song does not distinguish. It is a song though about dissolution of melting, of dissolving, of vanishing into mists, and, finally into death. The song is not held in the highest esteem by some musicologists and has been described by one as "saccharine" and "[smacking] somewhat of the idiom of Irving Berlin."

<poem>
1.
Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me,
Starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee;
Sounds of the rude world, heard in the day,
Lull'd by the moonlight have all pass'd away!
Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song,
List while I woo thee with soft melody;
Gone are the cares of life's busy throng,
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!

2.
Beautiful dreamer, out on the sea,
Mermaids are chanting the wild lorelei;
Over the streamlet vapors are borne,
Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn.
Beautiful dreamer, beam on my heart,
E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea;
Then will all clouds of sorrow depart,
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
</poem>


Box-Ironbark forest

Box-Ironbark forest is a forest or woodland ecosystem found in central Victoria in south-eastern Australia. It is named after the Box and Ironbark trees which grow in the forest. These tree species produce a lot of nectar and pollen throughout the year. This is important for the conservation of many species of birds and other animals.

Box-Ironbark forest lies mainly within the Goldfields region of Victoria. During the main years of the gold rush (1851-1870) it underwent intensive digging and clearing in the goldfields. Large areas of forest were cut down for use in the gold mines and for firewood in surrounding areas. After the gold rush, the forests were still heavily cut for firewood and cleared for farming.

Box-Ironbark forest is found on rocky, often auriferous (gold-bearing), soils, in flat and undulating landscapes at altitudes of 150–600 m above sea level. The average annual rainfall of is 500–800 mm. About 40% of the original forest ecosystem in Victoria is public land, with about 20% protected in conservation reserves. About 55% has been permanently cleared for agriculture, mining and urban development. Remaining forest is in small scattered areas.

Box-Ironbark forest has a canopy of box, ironbark and gum-barked eucalypts, growing to 25 m in height. Below them is an understorey of wattles, small-leaved and prostrate shrubs, herbs and grasses. The main trees are White Box, Red Box, Red Ironbark, Mugga Ironbark, Yellow Gum and Red Stringybark. In some areas they may grow with, or be replaced by, Yellow Box, Long-leaf Box or Silver Bundy. The mix of plants in the groundcover includes the largest concentrations of orchids of any Victorian ecosystem. Small herbs and shrubs found in Box-Ironbark forests include "Cheiranthera cyanaea", "Philotheca verrucosa", "Xerochrysum viscosum", "Pultenaea largiflorens", "Acacia williamsonii" and "Stuartina muelleri".

The trees of the Box-Ironbark forest produce a lot of flowers and nectar. They are a major source of nectar and pollen for honeyeaters, lorikeets and many kinds of invertebrates. Flowering of the different species of eucalypts takes place at different times of year so there is always a nectar or pollen source available for migratory, nomadic and resident birds. This means there are both more species, and greater numbers of individuals, of honeyeaters and lorikeets than in any other ecosystem. These birds include Black-chinned, Regent, Fuscous and Brown-headed Honeyeaters, Swift Parrots and Musk Lorikeets. The forest supports the largest numbers of Eastern Grey Kangaroos in Victoria and is a stronghold for Brush-tailed Phascogales, Yellow-footed Antechinuses and Squirrel Gliders.


Ironbark

Ironbark is a common name of a number of species within the genus "Eucalyptus" that have dark, deeply furrowed bark.

Many eucalypts shed their bark very year, but on an Ironbark the dead bark stays on the trees, forming the furrows. It becomes rough after drying out and becomes full of kino, a dark red tree sap exuded by the tree. The bark is resistant to fire and heat and protects the living tissue within the trunk and branches from fire. In cases of extreme fire, where leaves and shoots are removed, the bark protects the epicormic buds which allow the tree to reshoot.


Belanglo State Forest

Belanglo State Forest is a planted forest in the Australian state of New South Wales covering an area of about 3,500 hectares. It is south of Berrima in the Southern Highlands, five kilometres west of the Hume Highway between Sydney and Canberra. The forest is owned by the New South Wales Government and has some of the earliest pine plantings in the state. The public has free access to the forest; it is popular with recreational trail bike riders.

In 1992 and 1993, seven skeletons were found in the forest. These became known as "The Backpacker Murders" and was thought to be the work of a serial killer. Eventually, Ivan Milat was convicted of the murders in 1996 and sentenced to life imprisonment.

On the 29 August 2010 trail bike riders discovered another human skeleton in the forest. At first this was thought to be another victim of Ivan Milat, but later forensic evidence suggests that the remains were left there at a later date.

On 22 November 2010, three teenagers (including one related to Ivan Milat) were arrested over the murder of David Auchterlonie, in the Belanglo State Forest. He had been murdered by friends on his birthday, and left in a shallow grave. 
One of the teenagers reported the murder to the police.

Wombat State Forest

The Wombat State Forest, also called the Bullarook Forest, is west of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, between Woodend and Daylesford, at the Great Dividing Range. The forest covers an area of about . The Bullarook Wombat State Forest was set up in 1871.

The forest is managed by the Department of Sustainability and Environment. The management plan covers firewood and other products; protection of water supplies, conservation of biodiversity, and conservation of landscape. Other areas of importance include cultural heritage, research, education, tourism, recreation, mineral exploration, mining, and grazing.

The Dja Dja Wurrung peoples lived the area that is now state forest land. Before European settlement, the forest covered a larger area than it does today.

The forest was logged heavily during the gold rush era of the mid-1800s. The wood was used for tunnel supports, sleepers for tramways, lining of mining shafts, firewood for mine boilers, piles for piers and docks, electric poles, and heavy construction timbers. In 1860 the 1860 Land Act (Section 80) was created, which placed some restrictions on logging trees. In 1871, the Wombat State Forest was set up.

By 1884, there were 36 saw mills in the Wombat and Bullarook Forests. The wood was sent to Melbourne, Sandhurst, and Ballarat. There was little replanting and the young trees were burned. Eventually the forest was ruined, and timber harvesting was stopped.

After the gold rush, the forest slowly began to regrow. By the 1960s selected logging was begun to try to improve the quality of the forest. In the 1970s and 80s, the area was called the "Midlands Forest Management Area". This included the planting of pine trees for commercial logging.

In 2001, the local community published its own findings about the forest's sustainable management. This was one of the first examples of community involvement in a state-run management plan. In 2010, community worried that logging could begin in the forest because the State Government gave out logging licenses in western Victoria.

The Wombat Forest is divided by the Great Dividing Range. The forest grows along both sides of the Dividing Range, from Creswick to Mount Macedon. There are about 400 extinct volcanoes in a stretch that extends from Kilmore in the north to Mt Gambier in South Australia. Some of these volcanoes, including Mount Babbington, Mount Wilson and Blue Mount are in the Wombat Forest.

The geology make up is of Ordovician or Tertiary sediments. The rock types are of volcanic origin, dated to the Palaeozoic era. Quaternary basalts, all of volcanic origin, were in the west of the Wombat State Forest. These lands have been cleared for farming. However, Ordovician or sedimentary soils, with poor soil conditions for farming, have remained undisturbed. Since the Pliocene the forest has changed from ash rainforest to a dry sclerophyll forest.

The Wombat State Forest is the headwaters of the Lerderderg, Campaspe and Loddon rivers. An interesting part of the forest is a large number of mineral springs. These are about 80% of Australia’s mineral springs. The mineral waters are rich in calcium, silica, magnesium, iron and sulphur. The volcanic activity of the region has added carbon dioxide to the water that is seen in the form of bubbles emerging from the springs.

The native fauna are marsupials, monotremes, reptiles, amphibians, bats and birds. The Greater Glider ("Petauroides volans") is the largest possum found in this forest. It lives in the western part of the Wombat State Forest. Several threatened bird species live in the forest including the Great Egret, Intermediate Egret, Grey Goshawk, Australian Masked Owl, Powerful Owl and Square-tailed Kite. The forest is also home to the Red-browed Treecreeper and Olive Whistler.

2012 (movie)

2012 is a 2009 American science fiction disaster movie directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich. It was produced by Centropolis Entertainment, Emmerich's production company, and distributed by Columbia Pictures. It is based upon the 2012 phenomenon, which was a number of beliefs that destructive events would occur on or around December 21, 2012. It was released on November 13, 2009. Critics gave it mixed reviews. They liked its special effects, but were critical of its length (158 minutes) and screenwriting. It made $770 million worldwide.

Neutrinos from a very large solar flare from the sun cause the temperature of Earth to increase at a very fast rate, eventually causing a very large geological and meterological disaster. The plot follows Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) as he tries to bring his children, Noah (Liam James) and Lilly (Morgan Lily), ex-wife Kate Curtis (Amanda Peet), and her boyfriend, Gordon Silberman (Thomas McCarthy) to safety from the destructive events that occur. Among these events, a very large earthquake causes California to fall into the Pacific Ocean, the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts, and a very large tsunami hits the United States.

Leith is a place in Scotland, within the city of Edinburgh. It is a port.



Mount Cole State Forest

The Mount Cole State Forest is in western Victoria, Australia, near the town of Beaufort. The forest is around Mount Cole, which formed 390 million years ago. The Indigenous Australians, the Beeripmo balug people, called it "Bereep-bereep", which means "wild". The forest covers an area of 12,150 hectares, including the forest around Mount Lonarch.

The forest is on a plateau which is above grassy plains. The plateau is about 760 metres above sea level. High peaks in the forest include Mount Buangor (1,090 metres), Mount Cole (899 metres) and Ben Nevis (877 metres).

The main trees in the southern part of the forest are Messmate (Eucalyptus oblique), Manna Gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), and Blue Gums (Eucalyptus st johnii). In the north, which is drier, there are Yellow Box (Eucalyptus melliodora), and Red Stringybark (Eucalyptus macrorryncha). There is also the rare Mount Cole Grevillea, Grevillea montis-cole. On the high peaks there are groups of Snow Gums (Eucalyptus pauciflora).

There have been 130 different birds seen in the forest. Animals include kangaroos, wallabies, echidna, koalas and possums. In 1954, 160 koalas were set free in the forest to as part of a plan to re-establish the animals in Victorian forests. In the 19th century, deer were introduced and Sambar deer are still living in the wet gullies in the south of the forest.

Activities in the forest include camping, walking, four wheel driving, horse riding, and bird watching.

The purpose of the forest is to supply good quality hardwood logs for sawmills. The management plan for the forest also protects the water catchments of several creeks which supply water to nearby towns.

An area of 1,940 hectares, the Mount Buangor State Park, was protected from logging in 1973. This park includes the waterfalls on Middle Creek, and the large rock faces and caves on Cave Hill.

Royal forest

A royal forest is an area of land with various meanings, but basically it is woodland once owned by monarchs. 

In Anglo-Saxon England, the kings were great huntsmen but they never set aside areas forbidden to other users. Historians find no evidence of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs (c.500 to 1066) creating forests. 

However, under the Norman kings (after 1066), no hunting was allowed on Royal lands except by authority of the King. The law was designed to protect the "venison" and the "vert", the "noble" animals of the chase – notably red and fallow deer, the roe, and the wild boar – and the greenery which sustained them. 

Royal forests were designed as hunting areas reserved for the monarch or (by invitation) the aristocracy. The concept was introduced by the Normans to England in the 11th century, and in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, one-third of the land area of southern England was designated as royal forest. At one stage in the 12th century, all of Essex was afforested, and on his accession Henry II declared all of Huntingdonshire to be royal forest.

Afforestation, in particular the creation of the New Forest, figured large in the folk history of the "Norman Yoke": 

Forest law prescribed harsh punishment for anyone who committed any offence within the forests. Killing game was a capital offence. By the mid-17th century, enforcement of this law died out, but many English woodlands still bear the title "Royal Forest". The practice of reserving areas of land for the sole use of the aristocracy was common throughout Europe during the mediaeval period. 

Royal forests usually included large areas of heath, grassland and wetland – anywhere that supported deer and other game. In addition, when an area was designated forest, any villages, towns and fields that lay within it were also subject to forest law. Local inhabitants were restricted in the use of land they had previously relied on for their livelihood. However, common rights were not extinguished, but merely restricted.

Lapiș Forest

Lapiș Forest () is a forest in northwestern Romania. It is near the village of Nușfalău, which is about 9 km from Șimleu Silvaniei. It was declared a natural protected area by the Government Decision No. 2151 in 2004 (publishied in "Romanian Official Paper" Number 152 on April 12, 2005)

Hürtgen Forest

The Hürtgen forest (also: Huertgen Forest; ) is along the border between Belgium and Germany. The forest is in the southwest corner of the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The Rur River runs along the eastern edge of the forest.

During World War II, the U.S. and German armies took part in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest. In 1998, HBO made "When Trumpets Fade", which is a movie about the battle.

Zitter Forest

The Zitter Forest () is found in the Eifel region in the German district of Euskirchen (North Rhine-Westphalia) and in the Belgian province of Liège (Wallonia). Its highest point is 692 m above sea level. It is part of the Hohes Venn – Eifel Nature Park.

The Zitter Forest is one of the last habitats of the wildcat in Germany.

New Forest

The New Forest is an area of southern England. It includes one of the largest remaining pieces of open pasture land, heathland and forest in the heavily-populated south East of England. It covers south-west Hampshire and extends into south-eastern Wiltshire and towards easter, Dorset.

The name also refers to the New Forest National Park, which has similar boundaries. The New Forest District is a subdivision of Hampshire that covers most of the forest. There are many villages dotted around the area, and several small towns in the forest and around its edges.

The New Forest was created as a royal forest by King William I in about 1079 for the royal hunt, mainly of deer. It was created at the expense of more than 20 small hamlets and isolated farmsteads and so it was "new" at the time as a single compact area.

It was first recorded as "Nova Foresta" in Domesday Book in 1086. It is the only forest that the book describes in detail. "Probably no action of the early Norman kings is more notorious than their creation of the New Forest".

Two of William's sons died in the Forest: Prince Richard in 1081 and William II in 1100. Local folklore asserted that it was punishment for the crimes that William had committed when he created the New Forest. A 17th-century writer provides detail:

"William the Conqueror (for the making of the said Forest a harbour for Wild-beasts for his Game) caused 36 Parish Churches, with all the Houses thereto belonging, to be pulled down, and the poor Inhabitants left succourless of house or home. But this wicked act did not long go unpunished, for his Sons felt the smart thereof; Richard being blasted with a pestilent Air; Rufus shot through with an Arrow; and Henry his Grand-child, by Robert his eldest son, as he pursued his Game, was hanged among the boughs, and so dyed. This Forest at present affordeth great variety of Game, where his Majesty oft-times withdraws himself for his divertisement." 

The common rights were confirmed by statute in 1698. The New Forest became a source of timber for the Royal Navy, and plantations were created in the 18th century for that purpose. During the Great Storm of 1703, about 4000 oak trees were lost. The naval plantations affected the rights of the commoners, but the Forest gained new protection under an Act of Parliament in 1877.

The New Forest Act 1877 confirmed the historic rights of the commoners and prohibited the enclosure of more than at any time. It also reconstituted the Court of Verderers as representatives of the Commoners, rather than the Crown. The felling of broadleaved trees and their replacement by conifers began during the First World War to meet the wartime demand for wood. Further encroachments were made during the Second World War. This process is being reversed in places, with some plantations being returned to heathland or broadleaved woodland, but "Rhododendron" remains a problem.

As of 2005, roughly 90% of the New Forest is still owned by the Crown, whose lands have been managed by the Forestry Commission since 1923 andnow fall mostly inside the new National Park.

Further New Forest Acts followed in 1949, 1964 and 1970. The New Forest became an Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1971 and was made the New Forest Heritage Area in 1985, with more planning controls added in 1992. The New Forest was proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in June 1999 and became a national park in 2005.

The purpose of forest laws was to preserve the New Forest as a place for royal deer hunting, and interference with the King's deer and its forage was punished. The inhabitants of the area ("commoners") had pre-existing "rights of common".

The rights were to bring horses and cattle (but only rarely sheep) to the forest to graze ("common pasture"), to gather fuel wood, to cut peat for fuel, to dig clay ("marl"), and to turn out pigs between September and November to eat fallen acorns and beechnuts ("pannage" or "mast").

Grazing and pannage are still important to the Forest's ecology. Pigs can eat acorns without a problem, whereas to ponies and cattle large numbers of acorns can be poisonous. Pannage always lasts 60 days, but the start date varies according to the weather and when the acorns fall. The Verderers decide when pannage will start each year. At other times, the pigs must be taken in and kept on the owner's land, with the exception that pregnant sows, known as "privileged sows", are always allowed out, providing they are not a nuisance and return to the Commoner's holding at night. Commoners must have backup land outside the Forest to hold these depastured animals if necessary.

Commons rights used to be attached to particular plots of land or to particular hearths. Grazing of commoners' ponies and cattle is an essential part of the management of the gorest and helps to keep the heathland, bog, grassland and wood-pasture habitats and their wildlife in good shape. The ancient practice came under pressure, as the rising house prices in the area stopped local commoning families from moving into new homes, which have the rights attached. That meant that the next generation could not become commoners until their parents passed on the house and rights.

Those rights are now dissasociated. Efforts by the New Forest Commoners Defence Association, Verderers and associated bodies mean there is a burgeoning economy in the New Forest and a chance for some commoners to earn well above the minimum wage and additional help for their farming interests. That will help the commoners continue to preserve the Forest.

Sclerophyll

Sclerophyll is a type of vegetation which has hard leaves and short internodes (the distance between leaves along the stem). The word comes from the Greek "sclero" (hard) and "phyllon" (leaf). 

Sclerophyllous plants occur in many parts of the world. They are shaped by a Mediterranean climate, with mild, wet winters and long hot dry summers. Wildfires often occur. These conditions feature summer drought-tolerant plants with hard sclerophyllous evergreen leaves,

This kind of climate occurs in:

Charnwood Forest

Charnwood Forest is an area in north-western Leicestershire, England, near Leicester, Loughborough, and Coalville.

Although called a forest, it is extremely varied, with many different areas. It has 45 sites of geological or wildlife interest. Above all, it is the only site in Europe where the Ediacaran fossil "Charnia" is found.

The area has some extensive tracts of woodland. It is undulating, rocky and picturesque, with barren areas. It is generally 600 ft (180 m) and upwards. On its western side is an abandoned coalfield, with Coalville and other former mining villages. This is now being regenerated and replanted as part of the National Forest. The M1 motorway cuts through Charnwood Forest.

The hard stone of Charnwood Forest has been quarried for centuries, and was a source of grind-stones. The granite quarries are of national importance and supply crushed stone ("aggregate") to much of southern Britain.

Charnwood Forest includes a National Nature Reserve (NNR), 19 SSSIs, four geological conservation sites of international importance, and another six conservation sites, 13 Regionally Important Geological Sites (RIGS), five local nature reserves (LNRs), and seven Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust (LRWT) nature reserves.

A little more of a thousand people live permanently inside the caldera, in the small towns of "Bangaeira" and "Portela"; these towns are at about , where sometimes the temperature gets to . Part of the National Park of Fogo, it is one of the main tourist destinations of Cape Verde. It is accessed by a single central road long from São Filipe.

The vegetation is sparse but several endemic plants nevertheless grow there, especially "Echium vulcanorum" (') and "Erysimum caboverdeanum" (') that can not be found anywhere else.

Oil sands

Oil sands, or tar sands are an unconventional source of petroleum. The oil sands are a mixture of sand, clay and water in a dense and extremely sticky form of petroleum called bitumen.

Natural bitumen is found in many countries, with the largest quantities in Canada, Kazakhstan and Russia. 

The worldwide deposits may be over two trillion barrels (320 billion cubic metres). These estimates include deposits that have not yet been discovered. Around 70% of all known reserves are in Canada.

Oil produced from bitumen sands is often said to be unconventional oil. The production process takes energy, so the net energy gain is smaller than traditional oil. Making liquid fuels from oil sands makes 12 percent more greenhouse gases per barrel of oil than traditional oil. Oil sands have only recently been needed. Higher prices allow this more expensive type of oil production to sell.

Getting the oil sands off the ground often destroys large areas of land. Much water is used to separate the oil from the sand and then left polluted. Carbon dioxide and other emissions from the extraction process are polluting the air.
The environmental destruction caused by oil sand extraction is criticized by environmental groups such as Greenpeace, The Climate Reality Project, 350.org, MoveOn.org, the Sierra Club and the Energy Action Coalition.

In 2012 the European Union (EU) said that it may declare oil sands oil as "highly polluting". This caused stress between the EU and Canada.


350.org

350.org is an international environmental organization. It was started by author Bill McKibben, with the goal of building a global grassroots movement to fight against global warming and the of global warming. However the main goal is to lower the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in order to avoid climate change problems.

The name 350.org comes the research of scientist Dr. James Hansen. He wrote in a scientific paper in 2007 that the level of carbon dioxide (CO) in the atmosphere should not be higher than 350 parts-per-million (ppm). According to scientific research this is a safe maximum to avoid a climate tipping point.

350.org works with over 300 other organizations around the world. It has had people supporting the organization as "messengers". Among them are Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Alex Steffen, Bianca Jagger and David Suzuki. Van Jones and Gus Speth are on 350's U.S. Advisory Council. 350.org has a Board of Directors.

350.org is strongly against the Keystone XL pipeline project. The pipeline is currently being built to transport tar sand oil from Canada through the United States to oil refineries in the Gulf of Mexico. NASA climatologist James Hansen described the Keystone XL pipeline as "game over" for the planet, and called the amount of carbon stored in Canadian tar sands a "fuse to the largest carbon bomb on the planet". 

350.org wants colleges and universities, as well as cities, religious institutions, and pension funds to withdraw their investments from fossil fuel companies. They propose the money should rather be invested in sustainable companies.
The "Do The Math" movie is a 42-minute documentary about the movement, the science behind the climate crisis and how to end the age of fossil fuels.

The organization's efforts continued into 2012 with a Climate Impacts Day on May 5th of worldwide series of rallies under the slogan "Connect the Dots," to draw attention to the links between climate change and extreme weather.

350 helped helped organize the People's Climate March, which took place on September 21, 2014.



Fulk, King of Jerusalem

Fulk V (1092–1143), called ""le Jeune"" (the younger), was a French nobleman who was the Count of Anjou from 1109 to 1129. He was the Count of Maine ("jure uxoris") 1110–1129. Fulk was a crusader, Knight Templar and was the King of Jerusalem ("jure uxoris") from 1131 to his death.

Fulk le Jeune, born in 1092, was the younger son of Fulk IV le Réchin and his fifth wife Bertrade de Montfort. She was the daughter of Simon de Montfort, Count de Montfort l'Amaury. As an infant he was probably taken with his mother to be raised at the French court. He was at the French court in 1106 when the news arrived of his , Geoffrey IV, Count of Anjou's death. King Philip I then made his step-son, Fulk V, the Count of Anjou. The French king then made Duke William of Aquitaine Fulk's guardian as Fulk was not yet old enough to rule on his own. However the duke put Fulk in prison. Nothing the king or queen threatened could get Duke William to release the boy. After a year his father, Fulk le Réchin finally paid the duke a ransom of several towns on the border with Poitou. Fulk le Réchin died two years later on April 14, 1109. Fulk V "je June" succeeded his father as the count of Anjou.

In 1110 Fulk V le Jeune married Eremburge of Maine. When her father, Count Elias, died a few months later, Fulk V became the Count of Maine in right of his wife. But this brought him into immediate conflict with King Henry I of England who also claimed Maine. For a time Fulk was the first Angevin count to directly rule Maine. In 1113 Henry I arranged to meet with Fulk V at Alençon. There they arranged a peace agreement. To seal the agreement they made a marriage alliance. Fulk's infant daughter, Matilda, was promised in marriage to Henry's nine-year-old son, William Adelin. Fulk V remained the Count of Maine but he swore fealty to King Henry I as his overlord. Without his Angevin ally Fulk, King Louis VI of France was forced to make peace with King Henry I. King Louis confirmed the lordship (overlordship) of Maine to Henry I. Henry then attacked the lands of Robert de Bellême; joined by Fulk V. Bellême was defeated and Henry I returned to England. Fulk V returned to Anjou to deal with a revolt in Angers.

In 1116 Louis IV raided into Normandy again. Louis had supported Henry I's nephew, William Clito as the Duke of Normandy. By 1117 King Louis IV of France, Count Baldwin VII of Flanders and Fulk V of Anjou were all supporting William Clito against Henry I of England. The next summer Henry I returned to Normandy and the war began. Fulk V defeated Henry I at La Motte-Gautier on the border of Maine. In October 1118 Fulk V again defeated Henry I at Alençon. Finally, after a series of defeats Henry I made peace with Fulk V. They sealed their truce by allowing the marriage of Fulk's daughter Matilda with Henry's son William William Adelin. Fulk V gave Maine as a dowry for his daughter Matilda. In 1120 Fulk V then made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He spent a year at Jerusalem. According to Orderic Vitalis he joined the Knights Templar. When he returned to Anjou Fulk left 100 knights behind for a year to help defend the Kingdom. He continued to pay the Templars a substantial yearly donation for the rest of his life.
Fulk le Jeune returned to Anjou in early 1121. He learned that William Adelin, his new son-in-law William had drowned in the shipwreck of the White Ship. The treaty with Anjou then died with Henry's son. Fulk's daughter Matilda was safe; she had not been on the White ship. Fulk demanded her return to Anjou. But Henry delayed her return and kept part of her dowry. By 1122 she was back in Anjou. Fulk broke off all relations with Henry and made another marriage alliance with Henry's nephew and enemy, William Clito. William was to marry Fulk's daughter Sibyl. He again gave his new son-in-law the lordship of Maine as her dowry. As Henry dealt with his rebel Norman barons one by one, by 1124 Fulk V was William Clito's only supporter. Henry now did everything he could to get the pope to annul the marriage between William Clito and Sibyl. On 26 August 1124 Pope Calixtus II annulled the marriage of William Clito and Sibyl because they were too closely related.

In 1126 Fulk le Jeune's wife, Eremburge, Countess of Maine and Anjou died. In Germany,Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor died. His wife the Empress Matilda was Henry I of England's only living legitimate child. Henry called her back to England. Henry made all his English and Norman barons swear that in case Henry had no sons they would make Matilda the Queen of England succeeding him. In 1127 Henry made peace again with Fulk le Jeune and offered a new marriage alliance. Fulk's son, Geoffrey was to wed the Empress Matilda and Maine would be settled on the new couple. In June 1128, Henry I came to Rouen and there knighted Geoffrey of Anjou. A week later the couple was married.

About this same time Fulk le Jeune had received representatives of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. king Baldwin II had no sons but he had four daughters. He offered the hand of his oldest daughter, Melisende, to Fulk le June along with the crown of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem. Fulk was well known in Jerusalem from his earlier visit and the money he sent the Knights Templar every year. In Jerusalem Melisende became officially the heiress of the kingdom. She would rule as Queen at her father's death. After the wedding of his son Geoffrey, Fulk le Jeune and his children all met at the Fontevraud Abbey where his daughter Matilda became a nun. They said their farewells and Fulk le Jeune set off for Jerusalem. Geoffrey V, nicknamed "la Bel" was to rule Anjou in his father's absence.

In the spring of 1129 Fulk le Jeune arrived in Jerusalem. He and Melisende were married. As a part of their marriage contract at the death of her father, King Baldwin II, Fulk and Melisende were to rule Jerusalem together. As a dowry Fulk and Melisende received the two most valuable ports in the kingdom, Tyre and Acre. Fulk brought a large number of knights and foot soldiers with him from Anjou.

In 1131, on the death of Baldwin II of Jerusalem, Fulk was crowned king. Melisende was crowned Queen at the same time. But from the beginning of their rule Fulk attempted to ruled alone. He tried to keep Melisende from having an active part in ruling Jerusalem. Fulk began replacing governors and with his own followers from Anjou. Many had served several of the Kings of Jerusalem. Their loss of favor with the new king caused a great deal of resentment. Between 1133 and 1134 a revolt started among the nobility of Jerusalem led by count Count Hugh II of Jaffa's. Fulk called on Count Hugh to appear before him but Hugh refused. Fulk then took away Hugh's of Jaffa's. Hugh was angry and joined with their enemies the Egyptians. But his followers left Hugh and came back to King Fulk. Hugh next submitted to King Fulk and was exiled for three years. The revolt was broken. During the revolt however, the Seljuks of Damascus were able to take back Banyas. But Fulk realized he could not exclude Melisende and from then on allowed her to share in ruling the kingdom.

In 1132 Pons, Count of Tripoli was defeated by Seljuks and was under siege at the castle of Montferrand (Baarin). Fulk rushed to his aid and forced the enemy to retreat. In 1134 Fulk raided into Hauran (in present-day Syria and Jordan). But he was forced to retreat when Seljuks countered by attacking Jerusalem. In September the two sides agreed to a peace.

In 1136 Fulk began building castles around the fortress city of Ascalon. This was to prevent raids on Jerusalem by the Egyptian Fatimids. He also built a castle at Beth Gibelin and placed it in the care of the Knights Hospitaller. Also in 1136 the Grand Master (leader) of the Knights Templar, Hugues de Payens, died. Fulk used his influence with the Templars to get one of his own Angevins, Robert of Craon, elected Grand Master. In 1137 Fulk was besieged at Montferrand. The Patriarch of Jerusalem marched an army to relieve the fortress. But Fulk did not know his own army was coming to his rescue. The Seljuks knew of this and quickly offered Fulk favorable terms. King Fulk surrendered the castle in exchange for his own freedom.

In 1137 while the Christians and Muslims were engaged with each other a new force was entering the area. John, the Byzantine Emperor was moving against Antioch. He decided to take back the city and began attacking the walls. Too powerful for Fulk to deal with he decided to surrender Antioch to the Emperor. The Prince of Antioch, Raymond of Poitiers, had to surrender to the Emperor in person. Then, with the Byzantine flag above the city and Raymond still the Prince, the Emperor returned to Constantinople. Fulk, the King of Jerusalem, lost his control over Antioch.

On 10 November 1143 Fulk died in a hunting accident falling from his horse. After Fulk's death Melisende took control of Jerusalem. She ruled as queen and as for their oldest son Baldwin III.

In 1110, Fulk married Ermengarde of Maine († 1126), the daughter of Elias I of Maine. Together they had:

His second wife was Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem, the daughter of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem and Morphia of Melitene. Together they had:

Pacific Rim (movie)

Pacific Rim is a 2013 American science fiction monster movie. It was directed by Guillermo del Toro, and written by Toro and Travis Beacham. It was produced by Legendary Pictures and distributed by Warner Bros.. It was released on July 12, 2013. Critics gave it good reviews. They liked its special effects and action scenes. It made more than $384 million worldwide.

In 2013, the Earth's cities are attacked by Kaiju, very large monsters who come from a portal on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. To battle them, the nations in the Pacific Rim build the Jaegars: very large robots piloted by two people whose brains are linked to the robots. This allows the pilots to control the robots using their mind, and the robots do the same actions that the pilots do. Although the Jaegars work well in killing the Kaiju, the attacks happen more often and are more powerful. By 2025, the governments of the Pacific Rim have ended the Jaegar project and build very large walls to protect humans from the Kaiju. Most of the film is set in this period, focusing on the war's later days.

Hepburn Regional Park

The Hepburn Regional Park is a large bush and forest park which surrounds the towns of Daylesford and Hepburn Springs, in the Central Highlands area of Victoria, Australia. The Hepburn Regional Park was set up in 1977. It covers an area of 1,800 hectares. The park features a large number of minerals springs. In the Victorian gold rush of the 1850s' and 1860's there was a lot of gold mining in the area. There are many of these old gold mining sites within the forest. At the Blowhole on Sailors Creek, the miners dug a large tunnel to change the path of the creek so that they could search for gold. The Mount Franklin Reserve is also a part of the Hepburn Regional Park. This reserve protects the scoria cone of Mount Franklin, an extinct volcano. 

Most of the forest is fairly dry, with the main trees being box, peppermint and stringybark. In the south of the forest the climate is wetter, and manna gums, messmates and candlebark trees are common. In spring there are many wildflowers, including the Victorian floral emblem, Common or Pink Heath.

Animals in the forest include kangaroos, koalas and the rare Brush-tailed Phascogale. 

Creswick Regional Park

The Creswick Regional Park, also known as the Creswick State Forest, is a large forest near the town of Creswick, in Victoria, Australia. It covers an area of 930 hectares. Much of the forest was heavily logged to supply timber to the gold mines in Ballarat and Creswick during the 1850s and 1860s. Many gold mining sites can be found in the forest.

St.Georges Lake is a man-made lake built to supply water for hydraulic sluicing. Eaton's Dam is another gold water supply. In 1942, students from the Creswick Forestry School fenced a small area of forest to create a breeding area for koalas. However the koalas were able to climb the fence, and the Koala Park was not successful.

A section of the Great Dividing Trail, the Wallaby Track, passes through the Creswick Regional Park. Some of it follows the water races built by the gold miners to supply water for their activities.

Canonical form

In mathematics and computer science the term Canonical form, or sometimes Normal form refers to the usual representation of a mathematical object. For example, the canonical form of a positive integer in decimal representation is a finite sequence of digits that does not begin with zero.

Mathematics has defined equivalence relations for some objects. These equivalence relations say that certain classes of objects are "equal". These objects then belong to the same equivalence class. In such a case, a canonical form consists in the choice of a specific object in each class. For example, row echelon form and Jordan normal form are canonical forms for matrices.

Enfield State Park

The Enfield State Park, also known as the Enfield State Forest, is a large forest reserve south of Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. It covers an area of about 4,600 hectares. The Enfield State Park was once the site for gold mining, and there are many gold mining relics in the area. There was a Chinese settlement at Surface Point during the gold rush. There were temples, tearooms, gaming tents, herbalists and market gardens. People are still able to go searching for gold in the park. 

Timber from the forest was used for mining and building. There was a eucalyptus distillery at the town of Enfield, making eucalyptus oil.

There are also picnic areas and walking trails through the park.

The forest is an open dry forest, with messmates, peppermints, swamp gums, manna gums and the rare Yarra Gum. Over 100 bird species, and 22 native mammal species have been seen in the park.

Messmate

Messmate is a common name for a group of Eucalyptus" "trees". "They all have rough bark. It is not known where the name came from.

Species commonly known as "messmate" include:

Eucalyptus viminalis

Eucalyptus viminalis, or Manna Gum, is also known as White Gum, Ribbon Gum or Viminalis. It is an Australian eucalypt.

It is a straight tree growing to about 40 metres tall. It has rough bark on the trunk and the larger branches. The bark on the upper part of the tree peels away in long "ribbons" which can collect on the branches and surrounding ground. The tree with the largest recorded diameter (324.7 cm) is at Woodbourne in Marlborough, New Zealand.

"E. viminalis" grows in the cooler areas of Australia where the leaves are the favoured food of Koalas. The sap has a 5–15% sugar content which makes it an essential food for tree dwelling marsupials like the Yellow-bellied Glider, and the Sugar Glider.

There are three subspecies:


Timber is a pale pink to pinkish brown colour, often with distinctive light grey streaks. The attractive light pink tones of this species and its easy workability mean it is often used to make furniture. It has low strength and durability which makes it unsuitable for structural use, however some is used for house framing.

It can grow in temperatures as low as −15 degrees Celsius (+5 °F) or more making it suitable for planting in Europe.

Eucalyptus dives

Eucalyptus dives or broad-leaved peppermint is a small tree. It is found in the temperate dry sclerophyll woodlands and forests of South-Eastern Australia. The leaves have a strong peppermint smell.

The leaves have a high oil content, about 4.7% of the leaf fresh weight. When the oil is distilled it can be used to produce methanol. The major producing region is eastern Transvaal, South Africa, where it is grown in commercial plantations. The leaves have also been used as a flavouring in Australia, especially in brewed black "Camellia sinensis" 'billy tea'. 


Eyke

Eyke is a village and civil parish in Suffolk Coastal, Suffolk, England. In 2001 there were 366 people living in Eyke. Eyke is on the A1152 road. Eyke has a church called All Saints.


Falkenham

Falkenham is a village and civil parish in Suffolk Coastal, Suffolk, England. In 2001 there were 180 people living in Falkenham. Falkenham shares a parish council with nearby Kirton. Falkenham has a church called St Ethelbert.


Azerbaijani diaspora

The Azerbaijani diaspora is a term used to describe the communities of ethnic Azerbaijanis living outside of places of their ethnic origin: Republic of Azerbaijan and Iranian Azerbaijan. Of the total Azerbaijani population living worldwide which is estimated to be 30,000,000, only about 9,000,000 live in Azerbaijan and about 16,000,000 live in Iran.


Ermenonville Forest

The Ermenonville Forest () is a forest in Oise, France. On 3 March 1974, a Turkish Airlines flight crashed in the forest and in the commune of Fontaine-Chaalis. There is a memorial in the forest to the victims of that flight.

Forest of Tronçais

The Forest of Tronçais () is a French national forest. It is managed by the national office of forests. Its oaks were planted by Jean-Baptiste Colbert, minister of Louis XIV. They are one of the principal stands of oaks in Europe.

Numinbah Nature Reserve

Numinbah Nature Reserve is part of the Mount Warning caldera, in the Border ranges of north eastern New South Wales in Australia. Mount Warning is a volcano that erupted more than 23 million years ago. The 892 hectare Reserve is part of the Shield Volcano Group of the World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia listed in 1986. It was added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2007. The park is also part of the Scenic Rim Important Bird Area. It is important in the conservation of several species of threatened birds.

In New South Wales the Reserve is bounded by privately owned land. It includes an area of escarpment rising to over 1000 metres that is part of state border with Queensland. It is intended to be a place where the plants and animals are protected from humans, domestic animals and feral pests.

The vegetation is mostly sub-tropical rainforest with some wet sclerophyll forest. The rare rainforest tree Springbrook leatherwood grows at Burrigan Point.


Iranian Azerbaijanis

Iranian Azerbaijanis (Azerbaijani: ایران آذربایجانلیلاری; Persian: ایرانیان آذربایجان) are Iranians of Azerbaijani ethnicity. They are primarily found in and are native to the region of Iranian Azerbaijan. Iranian Azerbaijanis are the second largest ethnic group in Iran. 

Iranian Azerbaijanis are traditionally sensitive to their ethnic identity, but are supportive of bilingualism in Azerbaijani and Persian as well.

Iranian Azerbaijanis are a Turkic speaking people of mostly Iranian origin. According to Richard Frye, Iranian Azerbaijanis mainly descended from the earlier Iranian speakers of the region, who were Turkified after a massive migration of Oghuz Turks but still exist in smaller pockets, while Olivier Roy stated that Azerbaijanis as the descendants of the Iranian population of Azerbaijan (who spoke west Iranian languages such as Tati, which is still found in residual forms), which was Turkified by Turkomans from Anatolia from the 13th century onwards. The Azerbaijani language, who is lost the vocal harmony typical of Turkic languages, described as a Turkic language learned and spoken by Iranian peasants.

According to Russian scholar Rostislav Rybakov, Iranian Azerbaijan was almost fully Turkicized by 14th and 15th centuries, though the local population left its mark in the Azerbaijani culture and language and the ethnic border between the Turkish people and Azerbaijanis was established in the 16th century. In 1900, Joseph Deniker, stated that Azerbaijanis of Caucasus and Iran, who spoke a Turkic language, of the same physical type as Persians, who spoke an Iranian language.

A comparative study (2013) on the complete mitochondrial DNA diversity in Iranians has indicated that Iranian Azerbaijanis are more related to the people of Georgia, than they are to other Iranians, as well as to Armenians. The same multidimensional scaling plot demonstrates the intermediate position of Caucasian Azerbaijanis between the Azerbaijanis/Georgians and Turks/Iranians groupings. There is no significant difference between them and the other major ethnic groups of Iran. 

According to HLA testing, Azerbaijanis of Iran cluster together with the Turkmens of Gorgan and Kurds and constitute an intermediate position between Iranian populations and Western Siberians, specifically Chuvash, Mansi people, and Buryats (subgroups of Turkic peoples, Ugrians, and Mongols respectively). Several genetic studies show that the Azerbaijanis' gene pool largely overlap with that of the native populations in support of language replacement, including elite dominance, scenarios, while also demonstrating significant genetic influence from Siberia and Mongolia. No close genetic relationship was observed between Azerbaijanis of Iran and the people of Turkey or Central Asians. A study conducted on Azerbaijanis of Tabriz in 2022 also concluded that the genetic origins and Turkic language of the Azerbaijanis are do not correlate.

The Azerbaijanis are a Turkic speaking, predominantly Shia Muslim people and are culturally part of the Iranian peoples. The Azerbaijani language belongs to the Oghuz branch of the Turkic language family. Iranian Azerbaijani material culture is a result of multi-secular symbiosis, is thus a subtle combination of indigenous elements and nomadic contributions.

Most of the Iranian Azerbaijanis call themselves and are referred to as "Turks" but also insist on their Iranian identity, buttressed not only by the religious bond (being mostly Shia Muslim in contrast to the Turkish people of Anatolia, who are Sunni Muslims) but also by cultural, historical, and economic factors. Iranian Azerbaijanis are committed to Iranian culture and consider their destiny to be with the Persians rather than with "other Turks". Because of this, morerecently, in World War II, contact with the Azerbaijanis in Soviet Union were not overly cordial.

According to Ahmadi, the nationalism in Iran is that it has been largely promoted by intellectuals coming from the ethnically populated or originally non-Persian-speaking areas of Iran, in this case, Azerbaijani-speaking elites have played a remarkable role. Azerbaijani intellectuals such as Mirza Fatali Akhundov, Kazemzadeh Iranshahr, Ahmad Kasravi, Hassan Taqizadeh, Mahmoud Afshar, Taqi Arani, Yahya Zoka, Rezazadeh Shafaq, Javad Tabatabai, and others have contributed to the idea of nationalism and Iranian national identity and culture.

In addition to being, one of the forerunners of modern Iranian nationalism, Akhundov is also one of the founders of modern Iranian literature. Mirza Fatali Akhundov is not the only Azerbaijani intellectual in framing Iranian ultra-nationalism. Hassan Taqizadeh, the organizer of "Iran Society" in Berlin, has contributed to the development of Iranian nationalism. Since 1916 he published "Kaveh" periodical in Persian language, which included articles emphasizing the racial unity of Germans and Iranians.

Mahmoud Afshar, in various articles in his journal "Āyanda" (1925–27, 1944–45, 1955), a political scientist, pioneered a systematic scholarly treatment of various aspects of Iranian national identity, territorial integrity, and national unity. An influential nationalist, he also displayed a strong belief in the nationalist character of Iranian people throughout the country’s long history. He was the first to propose the idea of pan-Iranism to safeguard the unity and territorial integrity of the nation against the onslaught of pan-Turkism and pan-Arabism.

Ahmad Kasravi was the first Iranian Azerbaijani intellectual to take a strong position against Ottoman pan-Turkists and wrote the most significant work on the Iranian identity of Azerbaijan and its original Iranian language before the Turkification, Old Azeri. This work enjoyed worldwide scholarly success. The publication of this work can also be considered an affirmation of the indestructible bond of Turkophone Iranians to Iran.

Kazemzadeh Iranshahr, an ardent nationalist, set forth his views in a number of essays in his journal (1922–26), and more specifically in his "Tajalliyāt-e ruḥ-e irāni" (). He had maintained a clear romantic and primordialist notion of the Aryan race and the superior character of the Iranian peoples, which has manifested itself throughout the history of the nation.

In the post-Soviet era, when Elchibey, his Azerbaijani Popular Front Party, and other political elites and printed media initially launched their irredentist claims toward Iranian Azerbaijan by raising ideas such as "united Azerbaijan" or "the ques tion of southern Azerbaijan," Iranian Azerbaijanis were among the first to refute the historicity of such claims, beginning their historical, political and cultural research to launch an Iranian counter-argument. Kaveh Bayat, the contemporary Iranian historical researcher, wrote the first articles on pan-Turkism. In his other works, he presented documentary analysis of the early pan-Turkist claims against Iran in Turkey of the 1920s, and showed how Iranian Azerbaijani intellectuals and activists, such as Ali Sadeghi Tabrizi, Habibollah Nobakht, Taqi Arani, Moghaddam Bayat, and Rezazadeh Shafagh, were at the forefront of the fight for the defense of the Iranian identity of Azerbaijan and the Persian language.

Sources indicate that Azerbaijanis make up about 16 to 24 per cent of total population of Iran, making them the second largest ethnic group in Iran after the Persians.


Forest of Chaux

The Forest of Chaux is the second largest forest in France. It is in the region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, France on the east of the Jura mountains.

Temperate rainforest

Temperate rainforests are coniferous or broadleaf forests. They are in the temperate zone, and get heavy rain.

Temperate rainforest often occur in areas which have an oceanic moist climate. They are very notable for their lichen.

In many ways, they are similar to tropical rainforests, but they are in areas that are not as hot. 

The conditions are very moist, and more open to light than a tropical rain forest. The lower levels of the forest have an understory. This means that, under the trees, fungi, moss, ferns, shrubs with berries grow. Lichens are common in temperate rain forests.



Bois de Boulogne

The Bois de Boulogne is a large public park in the west of Paris. It was created between 1852 and 1858 during the reign of the Emperor Louis Napoleon. It is in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, near the suburbs of Boulogne-Billancourt and Neuilly-sur-Seine.

The Bois is the second-largest park in Paris, a bit smaller than the Bois de Vincennes on the eastern side of the city. It covers an area of 8.46 square kilometres, which is 2.5 times larger than Central Park in New York, and comparable in size to Richmond Park in London.

Within the boundaries of the Bois de Boulogne are an English landscape garden with several lakes and a cascade; two smaller botanical and landscape gardens; a zoo and amusement park; a complex of greenhouses holding a hundred thousand plants; two tracks for horse racing; a tennis stadium where the French Open tournament is held each year; and other attractions.

Forest of Fontainebleau

The Forest of Fontainebleau (, or "Forêt de Bière", meaning "forest of heather") is a mixed deciduous forest sixty kilometres southeast of Paris, France. 

It is mostly in the arrondissement of Fontainebleau in the southwestern part of the department of Seine-et-Marne. Parts of it are in adjoining cantons, and even as far west as the town of Milly-la-Forêt in the neighboring department, Essonne. Several "communes" are in the forest, notably the towns of Fontainebleau and Avon. The forest has an area of .

The most common trees in the forest are: oak (44%), Scots pine (40%), and European beech (10%). Three thousand species of mushrooms have been discovered. The forest is also home to approximately seven thousand animal species, five thousand of which are insects.

Caledonian Forest

The Caledonian Forest is a type of woodland that once covered vast areas of Scotland. Today, parts of the original forest survive, covering in 84 places. The forests are home to a wide variety of wildlife, much of which is not found elsewhere in the British Isles.

The Caledonian forests were formed at the end of the last ice age. Trees began to recolonise what is now the British Isles over a land bridge which is now beneath the English Channel. Forests of this type were found all over what is now the island of Great Britain for a short period. Then the climate began to warm and the pine wood retreated north into the Scottish Highlands. 

The native pinewoods which formed this westernmost outpost of the boreal forest of Europe are estimated to have covered as a vast wilderness of pine, birch, rowan, aspen, juniper, oak and a few other species. On the west coast, oak and birch predominated in a temperate rainforest ecosystem rich in ferns, mosses and lichens.

The forest takes its name from the Romans, who called Scotland "Caledonia", from the early Celtic word '*caleto-' meaning 'hard, strong'. The name was used by a local tribe or tribal confederation of native Picts or Britons called the "Caledonii".

Today less than 1% of the original native pinewood forest survives, in isolated remnants. The only real future of the once great forest is rewilding. This amounts to keeping sections free of deer and hogs until trees have a chance to grow. Natural predators are also needed to keep control of herbivores which would otherwise eat everything before trees could grow. Alan Watson Featherstone explains his life's work.

A unique ecosystem in the British Isles, the Caledonian pinewoods are home to some of the country's rarest wildlife. It is one of the last remaining wildernesses in the British Isles, but most of it has gone.

Wildlife

Wildlife originally meant non-domesticated animal species. It now includes all plants, fungi and other organisms which grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans. Domesticating wild plant and animal species for human benefit has occurred many times all over the planet. It has had a big effect on the environment, both positive and negative.

Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rain forests, plains, grasslands, and other areas including the most developed urban sites, all have distinct forms of wildlife. Most scientists agree that wildlife around is affected by human activities. A garden is not a natural habitat, but it is full of genuine wildlife.

Fourier analysis

Fourier analysis is a branch of analysis that looks at how more complex functions can be built with simpler ones. It is also known as classical harmonic analysis. It is named after Joseph Fourier who first used it in the 19th century. The process itself is called Fourier transform. Fourier analysis is widely used in fields such as physics, partial differential equations, number theory, combinatorics, signal processing, imaging, probability theory, statistics, option pricing, cryptography, numerical analysis, acoustics, oceanography, sonar, optics, diffraction, geometry and protein structure analysis.

Cannock Chase

Cannock Chase is a woodland and mixed area of countryside in the county of Staffordshire, England. The area has been designated as the Cannock Chase Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Chase gives its name to the local government district.
Cannock Chase is between Cannock, Lichfield, Rugeley and Stafford. It is a mixture of natural deciduous woodland, coniferous plantations, open heathland and the remains of early industry, such as coal mining.
Cannock Chase was made an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) on 16 September 1958. Much of the area is also a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Despite its relatively small area, the chase has a remarkable variety of landscape and wildlife.

The wildlife includes a herd of about 800 fallow deer. There are a number of rare and endangered birds, like the migrant Nightjars. A feeding station attracts many species, including Brambling, Yellowhammer and Bullfinch.

Efforts are underway to increase the amount of heathland on the chase, reintroducing shrubs such as heather in some areas where bracken and birch forest have crowded out most other plants. The local flora also includes several species of "Vaccinium", including the Cannock Chase Berry ("Vaccinium ×intermedium" Ruthe).

On the Chase's north-eastern edge can be found Shugborough Hall, ancestral home of the Earls of Lichfield. At its southern edge are the remains of Castle Ring, an Iron Age hill fort, which is the highest point on the Chase. Several glacial erratic boulders are also found on the Chase, remnants of glaciation. One is mounted on a plinth.

Since 2006, the forest has been used as an open-air music venue as part of the Forestry Commission nationwide Forest Tour, with acts such as The Zutons, The Feeling, Status Quo and Jools Holland playing in a forest clearing.
The area gained notoriety in the late 1960s when the Cannock Chase murders made national headlines; the remains of three young girls were found buried on the Chase after going missing from areas along the A34 road between there and Birmingham. Raymond Leslie Morris, a motor engineer from Walsall, was found guilty at Stafford assizes of one of the murders in 1968 and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He is still in prison over 40 years later and one of the country's longest serving prisoners.

The landscape owes much to the underlying Triassic "bunter" formations. These are sandstone deposits containing rounded pebbles. They can be found in Warwickshire, Cheshire, Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire, Devon and Dorset in England. They are thought to be alluvial deposits. Judging from the rounding of the mainly quartzite pebbles, they were carried for a long time in a large and turbulent river. The hard pebbles got powerful abrasion. The deposits in the English Midlands are thought to have been carried northwards from Brittany in northern France.

Heath

A heath or heathland is a shrubland habitat found mainly on low quality, acidic soils. It has open, low growing woody vegetation. 

There are some clear differences between "heath" and "moorland". For example "moorland" has a very peaty topsoil, and it is also free-draining, whereas a heath is not. Moorland is generally related to high-ground heaths with — especially in Great Britain — a cooler and damper climate.

Heathland is common worldwide. They form extensive and diverse communities across Australia in humid and sub-humid areas. Fire regimes with burning maintain the heathlands. Even more diverse though less widespread heath occurs in Southern Africa. Extensive heath communities can also be found in the California chaparral, New Caledonia, central Chile and along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. In addition to these extensive heath areas, the vegetation type is also found in scattered locations across all continents except Antarctica.

Count of Flanders

The Count of Flanders was the ruler or leader of the county of Flanders from the 9th century until the French Revolution in 1790. The first count was Baldwin I "Iron Arm". By expanding its borders the early counts managed to keep Flanders independent. Later, the lack of natural borders allowed into Flanders. Counts of Flanders were always concerned with hunting and preserving their hunting grounds. For that reason many were called foresters. The last count was Francis II. After 1795 Flanders no longer existed as a county.









Charles V proclaimed the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549 eternally uniting Flanders with the other lordships of the Low Countries in a personal union. When the Habsburg empire was divided among the heirs of Charles V, the Low Countries, including Flanders, went to Philip II of Spain, of the Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg.


Between 1706 and 1714 Flanders was invaded by the English and the Dutch during the War of the Spanish Succession. The fief was claimed by the House of Habsburg and the House of Bourbon. In 1713, the Treaty of Utrecht settled the succession and the County of Flanders went to the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg.


The title was abolished after revolutionary France annexed Flanders in 1795. Francis II relinquished his claim on the Low Countries in the Treaty of Campo Formio of 1797. The area remained part of France until the end of the Napoleonic Wars.

The Illinois

The Mile High Illinois, Illinois Sky-City, or simply The Illinois was a proposed skyscraper that would have been high, said by Frank Lloyd Wright in his 1956 book, "A Testament". 

The design, was to be built in Chicago, would have included 528 stories, with an area of . Wright said that there would be parking for 15,000 cars and 150 helicopters. 

Chicago is known for good reason as the "Windy City", though it is not the windiest city in the U.S. Had it been built, the Illinois would have been the tallest building in the world by far: more than four times the height of the then tallest building in the world, the Empire State Building, and nearly twice as tall as the world's current tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. 

The building is one of the visionary buildings meant to be an alternative to the increasing urban sprawl occurring in most cities. None of these has ever been viewed as financially feasible.

The design of the Burj Khalifa, the current tallest building in the world, is said to have been inspired by that of The Illinois.

PewDiePie

Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg (born 24 October 1989), better known by his online username PewDiePie, is a Swedish YouTuber. His content has changed significantly since he began uploading, now focusing on Minecraft gaming videos and established series such as 'You Laugh You Lose' and 'Last Week I Asked You (LWIAY)' where he reviews memes that his fans have posted on Reddit. He has over 111 million subscribers as of January 2024, but is slowly losing subscribers now as YouTube is removing inactive subscribers. On 15 August 2013, his channel became the most subscribed channel on YouTube. He was also the first YouTuber creator to get 100 million subscribers.

PewDiePie was born on 24 October 1989 in Gothenburg, Sweden. Before starting his own YouTube channel, PewDiePie studied Industrial Economics and Technology Management at Chalmers University of Technology until he dropped out. Disapproving of his decision, his parents cut off his support. He made a living by selling hot dogs until his channel got enough subscribers for him to make a living from the channel.

In 2013 PewDiePie surpassed making him the Number 1 Youtuber.

PewDiePie was the first channel ever to pass 50 million subscribers. PewDiePie is attempting to break the like record on YouTube.

PewDiePie was the first individual creator ever to pass 100 million subscribers on YouTube as of August 2019, though he did lose the position of being the first channel ever to reach that milestone by the Indian music channel T-Series in months earlier.
PewDiePie has been creating content that can be described as "silly and fun". Videos such as Meme Review, You Laugh You Lose (YLYL), Pew News, and Last Week I Asked You (LWIAY) are just a few examples. Recently, he has been uploading many Minecraft videos.

PewDiePie lives in Japan.
He formerly lived in Brighton, England with his wife, Marzia Bisognin, who is also former YouTuber. In 2019 he married his long-time girlfriend, Marzia Bisognin. The marriage was held at Kew Gardens in London, England.

Old Chicago Main Post Office Redevelopment

The Old Chicago Main Post Office Redevelopment was a proposed project on a lot located along the Chicago River on the southwest side of Downtown Chicago, Illinois to be constructed in phases over a period of one decade that will include the renovation of Chicago's historic Old Main Post Office building as well as residential, retail, entertainment and office space. 

The plan includes several towers, the tallest one being a proposed 120-story mixed use twin tower skyscraper that will stand about high to the roof, which would make it the tallest building in the United States, over taller than the Willis Tower, and will contain office, residential, and hotel space. It will also include two 60-story residential towers as well as a 40-story hotel. 

All the buildings in the development will be connected via a ground level complex that would be built over the Chicago River and the Eisenhower Expressway.

The proposal was sent to Chicago City Commission in July 2011 for approval, which was expected to be a several month process. The project is said to have an estimated cost of $3.5 billion and the potential to create 12,000 jobs. 

Some critics oppose the proposal in its current state, calling it old-fashioned and suburban and an unrealistic pipe dream, as it is largely car oriented (12,000 parking spaces and free parking) with shopping mall style retail.

The city voted and approved the plan July 18, 2013. But the area was sold in 2016 thus the building was never built.

Dauberval

Jean Bercher (known as Dauberval or D'Auberval; Montpellier, August 19, 1742 - Tours, February 14, 1802) was a French ballet dancer and choreographer. He was a pupil of Jean-Georges Noverre and made his debut at the Paris Opéra on June 12, 1762. He was a superb mime. He choreographed few ballets, but is credited with creating the comedy ballet.

Cri-Cri

Cri-Cri is a fictional talking cricket. The character was created by Francisco Gabilondo Soler and introduced in 1934 on his own musical radio show in Mexico. Cri-Cri is known as "el grillito cantor", which is Spanish for "the singing cricket".

The character was created by Gabilondo Soler when he was a child. It became so famous and gave its author such renown, that it became a second name for Gabilondo. In the mid part of the 20th century, he became the most recognizable singer of children's songs in Spanish. Gabilondo's dedication to this segment of the population has been greatly admired, comparable to Walt Disney in his honest approach to making life fun for those who are beginning to live it.

It was made into a movie that was released on 12 December 1963 in Mexico. It was produced by Producciones Carlos Amador.


Baldwin I, Count of Flanders

Baldwin I († 879), also known as "Baldwin Iron Arm" (), was a French nobleman and became the first count of Flanders. 

Baldwin's father was named Audacer but little else is known of him. His family was related to the counts of Laon. Before holding Flanders Baldwin was already a count, probably at Ghent. Baldwin was in Senlis in 862. Somehow he decided to take Judith, the daughter of Charles the Bald, the king, for his wife. Judith, had been the wife of two English kings, Athelwulf († 858) and Athelbald († 860). On her return and still in her teens she was being held at the castle of Senlis by her father. Baldwin took Judith, the twice daughter of Charles the Bald, 
and the couple fled to the court of Lothair II, king of Lorraine. He was Judith's cousin. Once they were safely out of her father's reach Baldwin married her. This was about 863. King Charles had his bishops excommunicate the couple. He also demanded that his nephew return Baldwin and his daughter Judith to him. At this point Baldwin and Judith fled to Rome. They asked Pope Nicholas I to and their marriage. Baldwin made known his intent to join the Vikings if his marriage was not allowed. Vikings were a constant threat in northern France and Baldwin was needed to help fight them. The pope decided their marriage was valid and had the bishops withdraw their excommunication. Charles the Bald was forced to accept Baldwin as his son-in-law. The couple was married a second time, in public. Her father did not attend but sent officials to witness the marriage. He gave Baldwin the honors the pope recommended. 

Baldwin was given rule over Flanders with the title of (count of a ) of Flanders. He protected Flanders for the next fifteen years from Vikings. He became known for his harsh treatment of anyone attacking Flanders. This later gave him the name "Baldwin Iron Arm". In 867 Baldwin built a castle at Ghent to protect from Viking raids. The city built up around the castle. Ghent became the seat of his . Baldwin also built a castle at Bruges, the port city on the North Sea. It too was for the purpose of stopping Viking . When Charles the Bald died in 877, Baldwin faithfully supported his son, Louis the Stammerer, helping him become king of the Franks. Baldwin died in 879.

Baldwin married Judith (–after 870), daughter of Charles the Bald, King of the Franks and Holy Roman Emperor. Together they had:


The Windy Hill

The Windy Hill is a long book for children. It was written by Cornelia Meigs. It tells a story about a boy and girl who live in New England. They meet a man who tells them stories which are about other people who used to live in New England. The people in these stories are part of the boy's and girl's family. Between these stories, the main story of the book happens. The main story is about a bad man who wants to take away the house where the boy and girl live. The bad man is part of the boy's and girl's family, too.

This book was first printed in 1921. Berta and Elmer Hader drew the pictures. In 1922, this book was made a Newbery Medal Honor Book.


Cornelia Meigs

Cornelia Lynde Meigs (December 6, 1884 – September 10, 1973) was an American writer. She wrote many kinds of writing. She wrote made-up stories for children. She wrote true stories for children about the lives of important people. She wrote about important things that happened in the past. She wrote about what books for children were good or bad. She also taught other people how to write in the English language.

One of the books that Cornelia Meigs wrote won the Newbery Medal in 1934. That book was called "Invincible Louisa". It told about the life of Louisa May Alcott. Three other books that Cornelia Meigs wrote were made Newbery Honor Books. That meant that the people who chose the Newbery Medal winner each year thought that those were very good books.
Cornelia Meigs was born in Rock Island, Illinois, on December 6, 1884. Her father was called Montgomery Meigs. Her mother was called Grace Lynde Meigs. Montgomery and Grace already had four other daughters who were older than Cornelia. Later they had one more daughter.

When Cornelia was one month old, the Meigs family moved to Keokuk, Iowa. Cornelia went to school there. She finished studying at Keokuk High School in 1901. After that, she went to Bryn Mawr College. In 1907, she got an A.B. degree from Bryn Mawr. After that, she went to Davenport, Iowa. She taught children to write good English. The school where she taught was called St. Katherine's School. While she was teaching there, Cornelia started writing books.

The first book that Cornelia wrote was called "The Kingdom of the Winding Road". It was first printed in 1915. Macmillan US was the publisher. In 1921 she wrote "The Windy Hill", and in 1922 that book was made a Newbery Medal Honor Book. In 1929 her fiction book "Clearing Weather" was made a Newbery Honor Book, and in 1933 her fiction book "Swift Rivers" was made a Newbery Honor Book. She also wrote other books for children during this time. Some of these books said that they were written by Adair Aldon. Adair Aldon was a pretend name or pseudonym that Cornelia Meigs used sometimes. "The Trade Wind", which was first printed in 1927, won a prize from Little, Brown, and Co., a book publishing company.

In 1934, Cornelia Meigs won the Newbery Medal for writing the true story book "Invincible Louisa". This book told about the life of Louisa May Alcott, a famous American writer during the 1800s. "Kirkus Reviews" said that this book was very good. Kirkus Reviews said that children who liked Louisa May Alcott's most famous book, "Little Women", should read "Invincible Louisa" too.

In 1932, Cornelia Meigs started teaching English at Bryn Mawr College. She taught there until 1950. During World War II, she worked for the United States War Department.

After 1950, Cornelia Meigs taught writing at the New School of Social Research in New York City. In 1953, she helped to write a book called "A Critical History of Children's Literature". This was a very important book. It said many things about writing for children. In 1969 she helped to write the second edition of this book.

Cornelia Meigs wrote more than 30 books for children in her life. Most of them were made-up stories. Two of them were true stories about the lives of famous people. Two of her books were plays. She also wrote some books and articles for grown-up people.

Cornelia Meigs died in Havre de Grace, Maryland, on September 10, 1973. She was 88 years old. Most of the papers that she left when she died are in the Special Collections Library at Dartmouth College. Some of her papers are in the de Grummond Collection at the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Some of them are at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa.








Armenians in Switzerland

Swiss-Armenians are citizens of Switzerland who are of Armenian ancestry. This means that they are ethnic Armenians, but live in Switzerland. The exact number of Armenians in Switzerland is not known. In the 2010 census, the number of Swiss citizens who claimed to be Armenian was 612. The full number of Armenians living in Switzerland is said to be between 3,000 and 5,000.

The majority of Swiss Armenians are members of the Armenian Apostolic Church. There are four church regions ("tems"): Geneva, Zurich, Neuchatel and Lugano. There are also a smaller number of Armenian Catholics, and even a smaller number of Armenian Evangelicals.

A number of Armenian associations operate in Switzerland:

A double dissolution is a procedure allowed by the constitution of Australia. If the House of Representatives and the Senate are unable to agree, the Governor General may dissolve both houses. This would cause a full election for all members. 

Gall wasp

Gall wasps, also called gallflies, are the family (Cynipidae) of the order Hymenoptera. They are in the Apocrita suborder of wasps. 

About 1300 species of this small creature (1-8 mm) are known worldwide, with about 360 species of 36 different genera in Europe and some 800 species in North America.

The larvae of most gall wasps develop in plant galls they induce themselves.

The plant galls develop after the female insect lays the eggs. The inducement for the gall formation is largely unknown. The hatching larvae nourish themselves with the nutritive tissue of the galls, in which they are well-protected from external environmental effects. 

70% of the known species live in oak trees. One can find galls on nearly all parts of such trees, some on the leaves, the buds, the branches, and the roots. Other species of gall wasps live in eucalyptus trees, rose bushes or maple trees, as well as many herbs. 

Most species have an alternation of generations, with a two-sex generation and a parthenogenic generation each year. 

A gall provides the developing wasp with a safe refuge for this most vulnerable stage of its life cycle. However, other wasps have found a way to penetrate this defence and parasitise the larva(e) within. 

Some of these parasitoids use their long, hardened egg-laying tube (ovipositor) to bore into the gall and lay an egg on the helpless gall maker. These parasitoids may, in turn, be preyed upon by other wasps, hyperparasitoids.

An early collector of gall wasps was Alfred Kinsey.

Steatorrhea

Steatorrhea means excess undigested fat in feces. In this case, the feces is often lighter, sometimes whitish, in color. It produces a fouler-than-usual, sour-rancid smell, and floats on the surface of the water as opposed to sinking to the bottom of the toilet bowl.

Steatorrhea is caused by the inability to digest and absorb fat in the diet. It may be helped in some cases by taking enzymes, such as those usually produced by the body, which digest fat.

Research should be done, and a doctor consulted if necessary, to determine the cause of the inability to digest and absorb fat.

The causes range from mild to very severe and life-threatenting, so simply treating symptoms may not be enough.

Meijer

Meijer is an American chain of hypermarkets. There are Meijer stores in Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana. Meijer sells other products as well as their own brands. The chain was ranked Number 13 on Forbes' 2011 list of "America's Largest Private Companies".

Rockland County, New York

Rockland County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. It is about 20 miles north of downtown New York City. About 300,000 people live there. The county has five towns: Orangetown, Clarkstown, Haverstraw, Stony Point, and Ramapo. The towns are divided into hamlets. The county seat is in New City. The largest village is Spring Valley. Rockland has a minor league baseball team, the Rockland Boulders.

The county was first settled by Native Americans who lived there for many years. It was later found by explorer Henry Hudson when he sailed up the Hudson River in the 1600s. Soon after, many English colonists moved to the area, and formed the first towns. The county was involved in the American Revolution, and an important battle took place there. 

After America won its independence, the county remained mainly rural, meaning most of it was farms and forests. This continued until the Tappan-Zee Bridge and Palisades Parkway were opened in the 1950s. These roads connected the county to New York City, allowing people to drive there. This caused more people to move to Rockland.


Baldwin II, Count of Flanders

Baldwin II ( 865–918), Called Baldwin "the Bald" (), was a French nobleman and the second count of Flanders. He ruled from 879 until his death.

Born he was the son of Baldwin I, Count of Flanders and Judith, a daughter of Charles the Bald. Through his mother he was a descendant of Charlemagne. Baldwin wanted to keep a good trading relationship with England. So in 884 Baldwin married Ælfthryth, a daughter of King Alfred the Great of England. This high-profile marriage raised the status of Baldwin II. His children had the distinction of belonging to two of the most important royal houses in western Europe. This and later marked the of Flanders as one of the great houses of Europe.

When he first started ruling Flanders there were a number of very damaging Viking raids. They everywhere except the area north of the Somme river. By 883 Baldwin was forced northward to the flat marshes of Flanders which became the territory most closely associated with the counts of Flanders from then on. Baldwin had built a series of wooden at Saint-Omer, Bruges, Ghent, and Courtrai. He also seized those lands and fortresses abandoned by royal and church officials. Baldwin had many of these same citadels used by his government, militia and local courts.

In 888 the west Frankish king Charles the Fat was . There were several candidates to be king in his place. Because he was a grandson of Charles the Bald, Holy Roman Emperor and King of West Francia, Baldwin was eligible to be king. But he did not compete for the crown of western Francia. Instead Baldwin joined others in trying to convince the East Frankish king Arnulf to also take the west Frankish crown. But Arnulf was not interested. Odo, Count of Paris, was elected king But Odo did not want Baldwin to gaining control of the abbey of St. Bertin. This was a rich prize and caused Baldwin to not support Odo. The new king attacked Baldwin at Bruges but could not defeat him. Baldwin continued moving his borders to the south and gained control of Artois. He also got control of the important abbey of St. Vaast. When control of the abbey was given to Archbishop Fulk of Reims in 900, Baldwin had him killed. When his attempts to expand further into the upper Somme River valley were opposed by Herbert I, Count of Vermandois Baldwin also had him killed.

Baldwin II died 10 September 918 at Blandinberg (near Ghent) and was succeeded by his eldest son Arnulf I of Flanders. His younger son Adalulf was (the first) count of Boulogne.

He married Elftryth, a daughter of Alfred the Great, King of England. They had the following children:


IPv4 address shortage

Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) has roughly 4 billion IP addresses. This is a problem because there are more than 4 billion Internet-connected computers in the world. This has led to a shortage of IPv4 addresses.

The long term solution is to switch to Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6). IPv6 has trillions of trillions of addresses, enough to give every computer in the world a unique IP address. Unfortunately, IPv6 is mostly incompatible with IPv4, and implementing it often requires replacing equipment such as routers. Not all ISPs currently offer IPv6. There are several backward compatibility protocols such as Protocol 41 and Teredo that allow a computer with only an IPv4 address to obtain an IPv6 address.

Network Address Translation (NAT) splits a single public IPv4 address into multiple private IPv4 addresses. It is considered a short term solution because it does not usually allow incoming connections without manual configuration of port forwarding.

Carrier-grade Network Address Translation (CGN or CGNAT) is Network Address Translation done by the Internet Service Provider (ISP). It is a short-term solution to provide IPv4 access where the ISP has more customers than public IP addresses. In this setup, multiple customers share a single public IPv4 address. CGN has the major drawback that it does not allow incoming connections at all, because the address translator does not know which customer an incoming connection was intended for. This makes it impossible or very difficult to host services such as websites or file servers. It also causes problems with some online games, online security cameras, and BitTorrent. Most land-line ISPs don't use CGN yet, but mobile providers often do. The address block 100.64.0.0/10 is reserved for CGN, although many ISPs improperly use 10.0.0.0/8 instead. ISPs that use CGN usually offer a public IPv4 address to customers that request one. They may offer this for free, charge a one-time fee, or charge a monthly or yearly fee. In the future they might not offer public IPv4 addresses or might charge a large fee for them, due to supply and demand.

Another proposal was to assign the class E IPv4 addresses, which are 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.254, for use on the public Internet. These addresses are currently reserved for "future" or "experimental" use. This would only add about 268 million addresses to the IPv4 Internet - not enough to prevent running out of addresses. Another issue with this approach is that most operating systems (including Windows), routers, servers, and other equipment block these addresses, as they assume that they are invalid. Using these addresses would require updating every computer, router, and server to recognize them as valid - effort which would better be spent on deploying IPv6.

A related proposal is to reassign the 127.0.0.0/8 block, except for 127.0.0.1, for use on the public Internet. These addresses are currently reserved as loopback addresses. As with the class E addresses, reassigning these would also require updating all equipment to recognize them as valid. It has also been proposed to reassign 0.0.0.0/8 (except for 0.0.0.0 itself). Another proposal was to reassign part of the class D block (currently multicast addresses) as unicast addresses. Several other address blocks were already reassigned in 2010 by RFC5735.

Flan

A Flan is a kind of tart found in British cuisine. It consists of an open pastry or sponge case holding a sweet or savoury filling. A typical flan is round, with shortcrust pastry.

Flan Brillat-Savarin, a savoury flan named in honour of the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin:


Timbale (food)

A timbale is a sweet pie-type food that is eaten as a dessert. The kind of pan it is cooked in is also called a timbale.

There are several variations of this. One example is the Timbale Brillat-Savarin, which is named in honour of the French gourmand Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin.

Upside-down cake

An upside-down cake is a cake that is baked in a single pan, then turned over and eaten with the bottom of the cake facing upwards. Usually, chopped fruits and a topping of butter and sugar are placed on the bottom of the pan before the batter is poured in. When the cake is turned over, the fruit sits on the top of the cake.

Traditional versions include the American pineapple upside-down cake, the French Tarte Tatin, and the Brazilian Bolo de banana.

The first mention of such a cake in writing was in 1930, but the cake is somewhat older.

Game pie

Game pie is a kind of meat pie made with game. It has been made since Roman times. 

Its main ingredients, then and now, are wild birds and animals such as partridge, pheasant, deer and hare. The pies became very elaborate during the 18th century in England. They developed complex recipes and special moulds and serving dishes. The versions cooked today are more simple, but they still include rabbit, venison, pigeon, pheasant, and other game meats.

The "Oreiller de la Belle Aurore" is an elaborate game pie named after Claudine-Aurore Récamier, the mother of Brillat-Savarin. The large square pie, which was one of her son's favorite meals, contains a variety of game birds and their livers, veal, pork, truffles, aspic, and more, in puff pastry. It is described in the classic encyclopedia of gastronomy, the Larousse Gastronomique. It is one of three pies named after people from Brillat-Savarin's home town of Belley (later called Bugey). They were described by Lucien Tenret.

Tappan Zee Bridge

The Tappan Zee Bridge is a bridge in the Hudson Valley region of New York. It is three miles long. It goes across the Hudson River. It connects Westchester and Rockland Counties. The bridge opened in 1955. It took traffic from other bridges and ferries in the area. The bridge is about north of New York City. The city can be seen from the bridge on a clear day. The bridge carries seven lanes of the New York State Thruway.

The bridge is named for a Native American tribe from the area called the "Tappan". "Zee" is the Dutch word for "sea", as the bridge crosses water.

At the beginning of the 21st century the bridge was old and too small for the traffic. People in the region argued for years for a new bridge, which replaced the old one in 2017. The old bridge was demolished in January 2019.

In 2013, the New York State Thruway Authority began building the New Tappan Zee Bridge. It will be a double-span bridge (four lanes per span in opposite directions) with designated bus lanes.The new bridge opened to traffic on August 26, 2017 for the westbound/northbound span. The eastbound/southbound span opened on September 11, 2018. The new span carries 10 lanes (4 lanes and with a bus lane in each direction) along with 2 pedestrian/bicycle lanes.

An October 14, 2012, "Newsday" article reports the Tappan Zee Bridge has been referred to as the Golden Gate Bridge of the East because of many suicide jumpers. The article says "The new Tappan Zee, which is in the works, will include fencing designed to thwart jumpers."

Antipope Benedict XIII

Benedict XIII (born Pedro Martínez de Luna y Pérez de Gotor; 1328–23 May 1423), known as "el Papa Luna" in Spanish, was an Aragonese nobleman who claimed to be Pope during the Western Schism. The Catholic Church officially considers him an antipope.

Mario Party: Island Tour

Mario Party: Island Tour is a party video game for the Nintendo 3DS game console. It is the 13th game in the "Mario Party" series. It has seven boards and 81 minigames. It was released on November 22, 2013.
The gameplay is similar to past games in the "Mario Party" series. Players go around boards by hitting dice, and play minigames. It features augmented reality (a live view of a real-world area which have things such as sound, video, or graphics added by a computer) and StreetPass.

Charles-Louis-Étienne Nuitter

Charles-Louis-Étienne Nuitter (24 April 1828 - 23 February 1899) was a French librettist, translator, and librarian. He is best remembered for having written the libretto for the ballet, "Coppélia" and for having helped translate Richard Wagner's earliest operas into French.

Arthur Saint-Léon

Arthur Saint-Léon (September 17, 1821 – September 2, 1870) was born in Paris, France. He was Ballet Master of the St. Petersburg Imperial Ballet from 1859 until 1869. He is best known for choreographing "Coppélia".

Nephew and niece

A nephew is the son of someone's brother or sister. A niece is the daughter of the person's brother or sister. To the nephew or niece, the person is their uncle or aunt. The relationship of aunt/uncle to niece/nephew is an example of second-degree relatives, meaning that their coefficient of relationship is 25%. In some cultures and families, it is common to call the child of one's cousin a "niece" or "nephew". In old English, the son of one's sister was called a "sister-son".

A sororal or fraternal relative is one who is related through their sister or brother. For example a sororal niece is the subject's sister's child. An in-law is a relationship that is not by blood, but instead by marriage. The in-law shares the in-law relationships of the spouses relatives. For niece or nephew in-law could be the child of a spouse.

Arnulf of Flanders (–964), called the Great, was a French nobleman and the third count of Flanders. He ruled from 918 until his death. He ruled an expanded County of Flanders, an area that is now northwestern Belgium and southwestern Netherlands.

Arnulf, born , was the son of count Baldwin II, Count of Flanders and Ælfthryth of Wessex. She was a daughter of Alfred the Great. Through his mother he was a descendant of the Anglo-Saxon kings of England. Through his father he was a descendant of Charlemagne. Arnulf was named after Saint Arnulf of Metz, a of the Carolingian dynasty.

At the death of their father in 918 Arnulf became Count of Flanders. His brother Adelolf succeeded to the County of Boulogne. When Adeloft died in 933 Arnulf took control of Boulogne and Ternois. His nephews were still young so it was probably as their guardian. Later he gave the of Boulogne to his nephew, Arnulf II.

Arnulf I greatly expanded Flemish rule to the south. He took over all or part of Artois, Ponthieu, Amiens, and Ostrevent. Arnulf exploited the conflicts between Charles the Simple and Robert I of France, and later those between Louis IV and his barons. In his southern expansion Arnulf had conflict with the Normans. They were trying to secure their northern frontier. This led to the 942 murder of the Duke of Normandy, William Longsword, at the hands of Arnulf's men. The Vikings became less of a threat during the later years of Arnulf's life. He worked on reforming his county government.

Arnulf's son, Baldwin III died in 962 leaving Arnold a crisis of succession. Baldwin's son Arnulf II 'the Young' was still a child and his succession was disputed. Arnulf offered the king, Lothair of France, Artois, Ponthieu, and Ostrevant in exchange for the king's protection of Arnulf II. His grandson inherited a weakened county of Flanders when he came of age. Arnold died on 27 March 964.

The name of Arnulf's first wife is unknown but he had at least one daughter by her:


In 934 he married Adele of Vermandois, daughter of Herbert II of Vermandois. Their children were:


Baldwin III, Count of Flanders

Baldwin III of Flanders called The Young (–962) was a French nobleman and briefly was the fourth count of Flanders. He ruled jointly with his father Arnulf I.

Baldwin III was born , the son of Arnulf I, Count of Flanders and his second wife, Adele of Vermandois (c. 915 – 969). She was a daughter of Herbert II, Count of Vermandois. Baldwin became co-ruler of Flanders in 958 alongside his father Arnulf I. During his short rule, Baldwin was responsible for establishing the wool manufacturing industry at Ghent and markets at other towns in Flanders. Baldwin III died on 1 January 962 of smallpox. He was buried at the Abbey of Saint Bertin. 

After Baldwin's death, Arnulf I arranged for King Lothair of France to become the guardian of Baldwin's son Arnulf II.

Shortly before 961 Baldwin married Mathilde of Saxony († 1008). She was a daughter of Hermann Billung(† 973), Duke of Saxony. They had a son:

Emulsion

An emulsion is what you get when you put two or more liquids together and the two liquids do not mix. Immiscible liquids do not mix together. For example, if you add oil to water, the oil floats on the surface of the water. And if you shake the two together then leave them to stand, tiny droplets of oil float upwards. These droplets join together until eventually the oil is floating on the water again. To stop the two liquids separating, we need a substance called an emulsifier.

Emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends, a hydrophilic end (water-loving) that forms chemical bonds with water but not with oils, and a hydrophobic end (water-hating lipophile) that forms chemical bonds with oils but not with water.

Goliath birdeater spider

The Goliath birdeater spider is one of the biggest spiders in the world. It is a tarantula. It lives in burrows in swampy areas of northen South America. It eats insects, rodents, bats, small birds, lizards, frogs, and snakes. The spiders have fangs, but their venom is harmless to people. Hairs on their bodies can irritate human skin. Explorers named the spider when they saw one eating a hummingbird. 

The female lays 100 to 200 eggs. The babies hatch in two months. The female spiders sometimes eat their mates. Females can live about 20 years, but males only live 3 to 6 years. These spiders can have a leg span of up to and a body length of up to . They can weigh up to . The spider's living areas are threatened by real estate development.

Judith, Countess of Flanders

Judith of Flanders (or Judith of the Franks) (–), was a member of the Frankish Royal family, twice Queen of Wessex, and by her third marriage Countess of Flanders. 

Judith was the eldest daughter of the Frankish King and Holy Roman Emperor Charles the Bald and his wife Ermentrude of Orléans. She was born about 844. Judith inherited her name and her willful temperament from her grandmother, Judith of Bavaria. In 855 King Æthelwulf of Wessex made a to Rome, remaining there about a year. On his return in 856 he stayed at the court of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles the Bald. In July Æthelwulf became engaged to Judith, Charles' oldest daughter. She was at most thirteen years of age at the time.

On 1 October 856 they were married at in northern France. The marriage was at best a diplomatic alliance. Both men were suffering from Viking attacks, and formed a common alliance. Charles insisted that his daughter be queen. He wanted her position in England. At her she was anointed with , usually reserved for anointing bishops and kings. 

Up to this time in Wessex they did not allow queens. The king's wife was just that, the king's wife. When Æthelwulf first ordered his new queen to sit beside him it caused concern among his people. In Wessex there were old regarding the evil of having a queen. But his order was obeyed without any objections from his nobles. Judith had no children by Æthelwulf, who died in 858. He was succeeded by his son Æthelbald, who married Judith, his step-mother. The marriage was by Asser as well as, according to him, all who heard of it. Two and a half years later Æthelbald died leaving her a widow a second time.

Judith returned to France the widow of her own stepson. To avoid scandal her father was keeping her under close guard at his castle at Senlis. He was looking for a new husband for her so she could be quietly married. Baldwin was already a count, probably at Ghent. He was in Senlis in early 862. Baldwin either abducted or convinced Judith to run off with him. The fact she slipped out of the castle dressed as a peasant girl seems to point to her cooperation. She also had help from her brother Lewis. When her father discovered what had happened he was furious. He was furious with Lewis as well. Baldwin and Judith fled to the court of Lothair II, king of Lorraine. He was Judith's cousin. Once they were safely out of her father's reach Baldwin married her. This was about 862. King Charles had his bishops excommunicate the couple. He also demanded that his nephew return Baldwin and his daughter Judith to him. At this point Baldwin and Judith wisely fled to Rome. They asked Pope Nicholas I to and their marriage. Baldwin made known his intent to join the Vikings if his marriage was not allowed. Vikings were a constant threat in northern France and Baldwin was needed to help fight them. The pope decided their marriage was valid and had the bishops withdraw their excommunication. Charles the Bald was forced to accept Baldwin as his son-in-law. By her marriage Judith became the first Countess of Flanders. Baldwin was given rule over Flanders with the title of (count of a ) of Flanders. He protected Flanders for the next fifteen years from Vikings. Judith was last known to be living in 870. Baldwin died in 879.

Judith gave her descendants, the counts of Flanders and Boulogne, the status of from Charlemagne. She was also an of Matilda of Flanders, the consort of William the Conqueror, and thus of later monarchs of England.

By her first husband, Æthelwulf, King of Wessex, she had no children.

By her second husband, Æthelbald, King of Wessex, she had no children.

By her third husband, Baldwin I of Flanders, Judith's children included:


Mechagodzilla

Mechagodzilla is a fictional giant robot dinosaurian mecha monster who appears in movies in the "Godzilla" series. He is Godzilla's robotic doppelgänger. He first appeared in "Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla", a 1974 kaiju movie from Toho Studios. He is one of Godzilla's most powerful enemies.

Coupling constant

Every force has a coupling constant, which is a measure of its strength in an interaction. The coupling constant determines the chances of one particle to emit or absorb another particle. In electromagnetism, for example, the coupling constant is based on the electric charge. A coupling constant plays an important role in dynamics.

When physicists study the quantum behaviour of electromagnetism, they can not solve the whole theory exactly, because every particle may emit and absorb many other particles, which may also do the same, endlessly. So events of emission and absorption are considered as perturbations and are dealt with by a series of approximations.

This also can happen in string theory. String theories have a coupling constant. It determines the probability that a 1-dimensional string of energy will separate into "two" separate energy strings. But unlike in particle theories, the string coupling constant is not just a number, but depends on one of the oscillation modes of the string. 

Latin dance

Latin dance is a general term for dance styles from the Americas and Spain. It is also a term for dances in the international latin dance syllabus: rumba, cha-cha-cha, samba, paso doble and jive.

Social latin dances include salsa, mambo, merengue, tumba, bachata, bomba, plena, cumbia, and the Argentine tango. There are many dances which were popular in the first part of the 20th century, but which are now of only historical interest. The Cuban danzón is a good example.

Arnulf II, Count of Flanders

Arnulf II of Flanders (–987), called Arnulf the Young was a French nobleman and the Count of Flanders. He ruled from 965 until his death. He ruled a much smaller County of Flanders than his father. 

Arnulf II, born about 961, was the son of Baldwin III, Count of Flanders and Mathilde. She was the daughter of Herman, Duke of Saxony. His father Baldwin III died in 962 when Arnulf was just an infant. His grandfather, Arnulf I, was still alive and ruling Flanders. When Arnulf I died three years later (965), the was held by his Baldwin Balso. The regent Balso died in 973.

By the time Arnulf reached his in 976, Flanders had lost some of the southern acquired by Arnulf I. His grandfather had given some parts of Picardy to King Lothar of France to help make sure his grandson, Arnulf II would succeed him. Arnulf I also Boulogne as a fief to his nephew, Arnulf II, Count of Boulogne. Then early in Arnulf's minority King Lothar had taken Ponthieu and given it to Hugh Capet, and the first counts of Guînes had established themselves there. Arnulf died on 30 March, 987, just 26 years old.
Shortly after Arnulf's death his widow married Robert II, King of France as his first wife.

In 968 he married Rozala of Lombardy, daughter of Berengar II of Italy, and had two children:


Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders

Baldwin IV of Flanders (980–1035) known as "Baldwin the Bearded", was a French nobleman and the Count of Flanders. He ruled from 987 until his death. His reign saw Flanders grow into a powerful principality. 

Baldwin IV, born c.980, was the son of Arnulf II, Count of Flanders and Rozala of Ivrea. When his father died in 987 Baldwin succeeded him as Count of Flanders . His mother, Rozala, was the regent of Flanders until he reached the age of majority. After his father's death, his mother's second marriage was arranged by Hugh Capet. She married Hugh's son Robert II, King of France as his first wife. When Robert repudiated her in 991 Baldwin rebelled. When they came to terms Artois and Ostrevant, once taken from Flanders, were returned to Baldwin.

Unlike his predecessors Baldwin was more interested in what lay east of Flanders. He left the southern part of his territory in the hands of his vassals the counts of Guînes, Hesdin, and St. Pol. Baldwin was the first count of Flanders to extend Flemish control eastward. He was given Zeeland as a fief by the Holy Roman Emperor Henry II. He also received Valenciennes from the emperor. Then Baldwin obtained parts of the Cambresis as well as Saint-Omer and the northern Ternois (1120). 

In the French territories the principality of Flanders remained powerful throughout the Capetian period. The Flemish economy saw strong growth during Baldwin's reign. Baldwin IV died on 30 May, 1035.

Baldwin married first, Ogive of Luxembourg. She was a daughter of Frederick of Luxembourg, by whom he had a son and heir: 


He secondly married Eleanor of Normandy, daughter of Richard II, Duke of Normandy, by whom he had a daughter: 


Ribozyme

A ribozyme (ribonucleic acid enzyme) is an RNA molecule that can help certain biochemical reactions. similar to the action of protein enzymes. 

Also called "catalytic RNA", ribozymes work in the ribosome to link amino acids during protein synthesis. They also take part in RNA splicing, viral replication, and transfer RNA biosynthesis. 

The 1981 discovery of ribozymes showed RNA can be both genetic material (like DNA) and a biological catalyst (like enzymes). This led to the RNA world hypothesis, in which RNA acts in the evolution of prebiotic self-replicating systems. 

Investigators studying the origin of life have produced ribozymes in the laboratory that can catalyze their own synthesis under certain conditions, such as an RNA polymerase ribozyme. Improved variants of the "Round-18" polymerase ribozyme have been developed. "B6.61" is able to add up to 20 nucleotides to a primer template in 24 hours, until it decomposes by cleavage of its phosphodiester bonds. The "tC19Z" ribozyme can add up to 95 nucleotides with great accuracy.

Some ribozymes may play an important role as therapeutic agents, as enzymes which target defined RNA sequences for cleavage, as biosensors, and for applications in genomics and gene discovery.

In 1967, Carl Woese, Francis Crick, and Leslie Orgel suggested that RNA could act as a catalyst. It was discovered that RNA can form complex secondary structures.

The first ribozymes were discovered in the 1980s. In 1989, Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their "discovery of catalytic properties of RNA".

Violin Concertos (Mozart)

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote at least five violin concertos between 1773 and 1776 in Salzburg, Austria, most likely for his own use as concertmaster of the Archbishop of Salzburg's orchestra.

This concerto is scored for violin solo, 2 oboes, 2 horns and strings, and was composed in Salzburg on April 14, 1773 or 1775. The date is uncertain. There are three movements: Allegro moderato; Adagio; Presto.

All three movements are written in sonata form, a form reserved by classical composers for their more serious works. The second movement is marked Adagio, a more intense tempo than Mozart's usual Andantes.

The D major concerto is scored for violin solo, 2 oboes, 2 horns, and strings. It was written in Salzburg and dated June 14, 1775. It consists of three movements: Allegro moderato; Andante; (Rondeau) Allegro.

This concerto is scored for violin solo, 2 oboes, 2 horns, and strings. It was composed in Salzburg and is dated September 12, 1775. It consists of three movements: Allegro; Adagio; (Rondeau) Allegro.

The fourth concerto in D major is scored for violin solo, 2 oboes, 2 horns, and strings. It was composed in Salzburg, and is dated October 1775. The autograph of the score is kept in Biblioteka Jagiellońska, Kraków. 

The fifth concerto in A major is scored for violin solo, 2 oboes, 2 horns, and strings. It was written in Salzburg and is dated December 20, 1775. It consists of three movements: Allegro aperto; Adagio; (Rondeau) Tempo di Menuetto.

A sixth concerto, in E flat major, was at one time attributed to Mozart but is now attributed instead to Johann Friedrich Eck.

Violin Concerto No. 7 in D Major, also called the Kolb Concerto.


Samurai Pizza Cats

Samurai Pizza Cats is a television anime series produced by Saban. It is an English version of the Japanese anime series " Kyatto Ninden Teyandee", which aired on TV Tokyo from February 1, 1990 to February 12, 1991. It aired for 54 episodes. It was very popular among English anime fans because of its references to pop culture and the crazy nature of the show.

The series is about a group of three robotic samurai cats (Rick Gomez, Tress MacNeille, Paul Reubens) called the Samurai Pizza Cats who protect the city of Little Tokyo from crime. Little Tokyo is a mechanical city which combines feudal Japanese culture with present day culture. When they are not fighting crime, the Samurai Pizza Cats work at the city's pizzeria.


Latte

Latte is a kind of coffee made with espresso and hot milk.


Adventure movie

Adventure movies are a genre of movies. They contain many of the same features of action movies, but are usually set in exotic locations. The main theme is adventure, with the characters often exploring places they have not been before or doing things they have not done before. Common storylines include quests for lost treasure, heroic journeys for the unknown, and jungle or desert settings. Adventure movies are often set in an historical time and may be based on stories of historical or fictional adventure heroes within the historical context. Kings, battles, rebellion or piracy are commonly seen in adventure movies. Adventure movies may also be combined with other movie genres, such as science fiction, fantasy and sometimes war movies. 

The adventure movie was most popular in Hollywood during the 1930s and 1940s. Movies such as "Captain Blood", "The Adventures of Robin Hood" and "The Mark of Zorro" were regularly made with major stars, notably Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power, who were closely associated with the genre. In the earliest adventure movies, the main character was usually male. They were portrayed as courageous heroes, facing tyrants or rescuing a beautiful woman in distress.

Adventure movies usually emphasise the mystery, romance, adventure, danger, and terror of the unknown. Common settings include a jungle or desert. Classic dangers include ferocious man-eating mammals and reptiles, hostile natives, deadly diseases, lost cities and crumbling temples, torrential rivers, waterfalls, whirlpools, and quicksand bogs, damsels in distress, evil emirs and treacherous tribal chieftains, and despicable white adventurers from the civilized world intent on exploiting the jungle, its animals, treasures, resources, and primitive native peoples. 

Adventure movies may crossover into other genres such as war, crime, romance, or horror.

Notable examples of jungle adventure movies include "King Kong" (adventure, romance, horror), "The African Queen" (romance, adventure), "I Walked with a Zombie" (romance, horror), Disney's animated "The Jungle Book" (children's, comedy, musical), "Apocalypse Now" (war), and the many Bomba movies, and the Tarzan movies and serials. Since the first theatrical releases of jungle movies in the early 20th century, popular interest in the genre has never waned. Comic books, novels, pulp magazines, and television series have stoked the genre's popularity over the decades. 

Fernand Léger

Fernand Léger (born Joseph Fernand Henri Léger, 4 February 1881 – 17 August 1955) was a French painter, sculptor, and filmmaker. In his early works he created a personal form of cubism which he gradually changed into a more popular figurative style. His boldly simplified treatment of modern subject matter made him a forerunner of pop art.

His personal style was called "tubism" because it was influenced by cubism, but used tube-like forms.

Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum

The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (often referred to as "The Guggenheim") is a well-known art museum on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City. It has a large collection of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, early Modern and contemporary art. It also has several special exhibitions during each year.

The museum was started by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1939 as the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, under the guidance of its first director, the artist Hilla von Rebay. The name was changed to honor the founder, Solomon R. Guggenheim, after his death in 1952.

Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, the cylindrical museum building is wider at the top than the bottom. He wanted it to be a "temple of the spirit". The building is one of the 20th century's most important architectural landmarks. The building opened on October 21, 1959, replacing rented spaces used by the museum since 1939.

To design the museum, Wright created more than 700 sketches until the final draft of the project was official. Wright spent 16 years working on the design, but he died before the building was completed. His design created a lot of arguments as many people did not like it. One person said it looked like "an indigestible hot cross bun", and another said it looked like "an inverted oatmeal dish." Some artists thought that the curved walls and ramps would make it impossible to hang their paintings properly.


Robie House

The Frederick C. Robie House is a U.S. National Historic Landmark in the Chicago, Illinois neighborhood of Hyde Park at 5757 S. Woodlawn Avenue on the South Side. It was designed and built between 1908 and 1910 by architect Frank Lloyd Wright and is renowned as the greatest example of the Prairie School style, the first architectural style that was uniquely American. It was designated a National Historic Landmark on November 27, 1963 and was on the very first National Register of Historic Places list of October 15, 1966.


Humberto Maturana

Humberto Maturana (September 14, 1928 – May 6, 2021) was a Chilean biologist and philosopher. He was one of the second-wave systems scientists and cyberneticians. Maturana was born in Santiago, Chile.

Maturana, with Francisco Varela, was known for creating the term autopoiesis about the nature of life. His work has been influential in many fields, mainly the field of systems thinking and cybernetics. Overall, his work is concerned with the biology of cognition.

Maturana died on May 6, 2021 in Santiago from pneumonia at the age of 92.

Baldwin V, Count of Flanders

Baldwin V of Flanders (1012–1067) known as Baldwin de Lille or Baldwin de Insulanus, was a French nobleman and the Count of Flanders. He ruled from 1035 until his death. Baldwin was one of the most powerful counts in France at the time.

He was the son of Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders and his first wife Ogive of Luxembourg. She was a daughter of Frederick of Luxembourg, In 1028 Baldwin married Adèle of France She was the daughter of King Robert II of France. At her instigation he rebelled against his father, Baldwin IV, but in 1030 they were reconciled. When his father died in 1035 Baldwin succeeded him.

While Eustace I, Count of Boulogne was usually at odds with Baldwin IV, he and Baldwin V had friendly relations. They signed each other's and worked together several times. Eustace I signed three charters of Baldwin's which limited the power of . 

Flanders under Baldwin V did not have very good relations with England. Baldwin gave refuge to England's and even gave them ships and men at times. He protected Queen Emma 1036-1040 as well as her two sons Alfred and Harthacnut. When Earl Godwin, Earl of Wessex and his family were exiled by Edward the Confessor in 1051-2, Baldwin welcomed them. He also helped them to prepare their return to England. In turn Edward the Confessor positioned his fleet off the coast of Flanders while Baldwin V was warring with Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor in 1049. This threat caused Baldwin to sue for peace with the Emperor. 

Baldwin V had a great deal of influence due in part to several marriages alliance between Flanders and England, France and Germany. He was close to his , Henry I,the king of France. From 1060 to 1067 Baldwin was the Regent for his nephew Philip I of France. In 1051 Baldwin had Richildis, the widow of Count Herman of Hainault, to marry his son Baldwin VI. This gave him control of Hainault through his son. This also led to a series of conflicts between Baldwin V and Emperor Henry III, as Hainault was part of the Holy Roman Empire. After a series of defeats Henry III withdrew back to Germany and died a short time later. In 1056 Baldwin received the whole of the Schelt march as a fief from Agnes of Poitou, regent for her son Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. Baldwin's daughter Matilda married William I of England, later king of England. At first the marriage was banned by Pope Leo IX. He did not give a reason but it was probably because the two were cousins. Some time between 1050 and 1052 the two married despite the ban. Although Baldwin allowed some Flemish support for his Norman conquest of England relations between Baldwin and his son-in-law William the Conqueror were not that friendly. The English king was wary of Baldwin's growing power. But by then Baldwin was growing old. He died 1 September 1067.

Baldwin and his wife Adèle had three children:


Weymouth, Massachusetts

Weymouth is a city in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, United States. As of the 2020 census, Weymouth had a total population of 57,437. Despite its city status, it is formally known as the Town of Weymouth. It is named after Weymouth, Dorset, a coastal town in England. The 1st Town Meeting was held in Weymouth (Wessagussett) in the Spring of 1622. The 375th Town Meeting was held in the Spring of 1999. The final Town Meeting was held in the Fall of 1999 after a vote by citizens to change the Town Charter to form a City Form of Government. Wessagussett was the Algonquin name of Weymouth which was the Territory of the Massachusett Tribe under the leadership of its Sachem Chickatawbut. His son Josiah Chickatawbut "sold" Wessagussett to the Colonists in a Deed dated 1642. In the Spring of 1623, Wessagussett was the site of the first act of Genocide when Captain Myles Standish and 8 men, led by Wampanoag Warrior Hobbamock killed Massachusett Leaders Wituwamat and Pecksuot and several others in an unprovoked raid. The date given for this event is April 6, 1623. 

Abigail Smith, daughter of Rev. William Smith and Elizabeth (Quincy) was born in North Weymouth on November 11, 1744. She would marry John Adams of Braintree, MA, who would become the 2nd President of the United States. Their son, John Quincy Adams, would become the 6th President of the United States. John and Abigail would become the first to live in the White House in Washington, DC. It is the second oldest European settlement in Massachusetts. Actor Hal Holbrook and architect Frank Lloyd Wright lived in Weymouth.

Eustace I, Count of Boulogne

Eustace I, of Boulogne, was a Frankish nobleman and Count of Boulogne. He held the county of Boulogne from 1042 until his death.

He was the oldest son of Count Baldwin II of Boulogne and Adelina of Holland. Eustace became count in 1042. Eustace I was also the count of Lens.

During the minority of Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders, Eustace's grandfather, Arnulf III, Count of Boulogne, broke free of control by the count of Flanders. Both Eustace's father and Eustace himself remained independent. In 995, having reached his , Baldwin IV of Flanders tried to take back several of the independently held castles. He also expanded the Flemish borders. This had caused considerable between Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders and Eustace's father. When Baldwin IV's son Baldwin V succeeded him in 1035 Eustace I and Baldwin V of Flanders cooperated on several ventures including several charters. Eustace also signed charters of Baldwin V which limited the powers of the .

Eustace I was allied to the house of Normandy. This was through the marriage of his son Eustace II to Goda, niece of Richard II. Under Eustace I the counts of Boulogne rose to great prominence in Northern France. He was apparently a patron of Samer Abbey near Calais and he is said to have been buried there. In 1028 Eustace I confirmed the foundation of a college of canons at his castle at Lens Eustace I died in 1049.

Eustace I was married to Matilda of Leuven. She was the daughter of Lambert I, Count of Leuven. Together they had:

American Airlines Flight 587

American Airlines Flight 587 was a scheduled commercial flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City to Las Américas International Airport in the Dominican Republic. The aircraft was a Airbus A300-600. On November 12, 2001, the aircraft crashed into the Belle Harbor neighborhood of Queens, New York. All 260 people on the flight were killed. Five people on the ground were also killed. The crash was caused by the failure of the plane's tail because of pilot error in wake turbulence (turbulence that forms behind an airplane as it flies through the air). It is the second-deadliest plane crash in the United States after American Airlines Flight 191, which occurred on May 25, 1979.

Since the accident took place two months and one day after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in Manhattan, it led people to believe that the crash was caused by terrorism.

American Airlines Flight 587, an Airbus A300B4-605R registration (N14053) was piloted by Captain Edward States, (42) and First Officer Sten Molin, (34). The First Officer was flying the plane. Most of the passengers on-board (159) were Americans, but 68 were Dominicans as well, there were also five Indonesians, three Taiwanese, two Canadians, two Australians, two Brazilians, one French, one German, one Haitian, one Italian, one Japanese, one Dutch, one Israeli, one Mexican, one British, and one Swiss passenger on board.

Flight 587 was scheduled to leave John F Kennedy at 08:00 for a flight to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The boarding process at gate 22 took a little longer than planned due to additional security procedures that delayed boarding. The gate was closed at 08:38 and push-back from the gate was accomplished at 9:00. The crew taxied to runway 31L behind Japan Airlines Flight 047, a Boeing 747-400 bound for Tokyo, Narita. That was cleared for takeoff at 9:11am. As the 747 climbed, the tower contacted Flight 587’s pilots and warned them about potential wake turbulence from the 747.

At 9:13:28 Flight 587 was cleared for takeoff from Runway 31L. The aircraft left the runway at 9:14:29, about 1 minute and 40 seconds after the JAL flight. From takeoff, the plane climbed to an altitude of 500 ft and then entered a climbing left turn to heading of 220. At 9:15:00, the pilot made initial contact with the departure controller informing him that the airplane was at 1,300 ft and climbing to 5,000 ft. The departure controller instructed the aircraft to maintain 13,000 ft.

At 9:15:36, the aircraft hit wake turbulence from the JAL flight just in front of it. The first officer attempted to stabilise the aircraft with alternating aggressive rudder inputs from left to right. This continued for at least 20 seconds, until 9:15:56, when the stress of the first officer’s repeated rudder movements caused the lugs that attached the vertical stabilizer and rudder to break. The stabilizer separated from the aircraft and fell into Jamaica Bay, about one mile north of the main wreckage site.

Eight seconds later, the stall warning sounded on the cockpit voice recorder. At the moment the stabilizer separated from the aircraft the plane pitched downwards. As the pilots struggled to control the aircraft, it went into a flat spin. The resulting aerodynamic loads sheared both engines from the aircraft seconds before impact. The engines landed several blocks north and east of the main wreckage site. Losing the engines cut off power to the flight data recorder at 9:16:00, while the cockpit voice recorder cut off at 9:16:15, moments before impact.

The fuselage slammed onto the ground in Belle Harbor on Newport Avenue and Beach 131st Street, instantly destroying three houses. All 260 people aboard the plane and five people on the ground were killed, and one person on the ground was injured and the impact forces and post-crash fire destroyed the wreckage.

The investigation into the crash was led by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

They decided that the probable cause of the in-flight separation of the vertical stabilizer was the result of the loads beyond ultimate design that were created by the first officer’s unnecessary and excessive rudder pedal inputs. Contributing to these rudder pedal inputs were characteristics of the A300-600 rudder system design and elements of the American Airlines Aircraft Manoeuvring Program.


La Cambre Abbey

La Cambre Abbey (French: Abbaye de la Cambre) is a former abbey in Ixelles, Brussels, Belgium. It is between Bois de la Cambre and the Ixelles Ponds. It was founded in 1201 by a noble woman of Brussels, Gisèle. The abbey church is a Catholic church.

Altered state of consciousness

An altered state of consciousness (ASC), or altered state of mind, is any condition which is significantly different from a normal waking state. The expression was used in 1966 by Arnold M. Ludwig, and brought into common usage by Charles Tart. It describes induced changes in one's mental state, almost always temporary. A synonymous phrase is "altered state of awareness".

Altered states of consciousness can be associated with artistic creativity, or different focus levels. They also can be shared between people and studied as a subject of sociological research.

During an altered state of consciousness, brain waves occupy different frequencies (i.e. Epsilon, Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma). These waves can be measured by electroencephalography (EEG). Also, subjective reports and observer reports of behaviour are used to identify the altered state.


Tony! Toni! Toné!

Tony! Toni! Toné! are an American rhythm and blues group. They started in Oakland, California. They were very popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Their first record, "Who?", was released in 1988. Their hit singles included "Little Walter" and "Let's Get Down". They disbanded around 1997, although they returned six years later.



Autopoiesis

Autopoiesis refers to life and other self-organising systems. The word means "self creation or self-production". It refers to a system which can reproduce and sustain itself. 

The term was introduced in 1972 by Chilean biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela to define the self-maintaining chemistry of living cells. Since then the concept has also been applied to systems theory and sociology. 

Autopoiesis was a modern definition for life, plus any other systems with lifelike properties. To qualify for the name "autopoiesis" a system would need to show three main features:
Roth commented that "In short, organisms are self-reproducing and self-maintaining, or 'autopoietic', systems". This approach makes use of molecular biology ideas and systems science ideas, but it does not refer to the particular way life is organised on Earth. This is because the authors thought it was possible for machines to have those features, and for other types of life to exist.

Aloe

Aloe is a genus of succulent plants, with over 500 species. The best-known of these is probably "Aloe vera", which is widely cultivated. "Aloe vera" is probably extinct in the wild.

The species "Aloe vera" is a great natural moisturizer and can help to soothe dry skin. It also has anti-inflammatory properties, which can help to reduce the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles. Plus, "Aloe vera" is non-irritating and can be used on any type of skin. 

Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders

Baldwin VI of Flanders (–1070), called Baldwin de Mons was a Frankish nobleman. He was the ruling Count of Hainaut ("jure uxoris") from 1051 to 1070 (as Baldwin I) and succeeded his father as Count of Flanders from 1067 to 1070.

Baldwin was the oldest son of Baldwin V, Count of Flanders and Adela of France. Adela was a daughter of king Robert II of France. and Constance of Arles. He was also the brother of Matilda of Flanders, Queen consort of England and wife of William the Conqueror, King of England.

His father arranged his marriage, under threat of arms, to Richilde, Countess of Hainaut. She was the widow of Herman of Mons and heiress of Hainaut. Because Hainaut was a part of the Holy Roman Empire this enraged Emperor Henry III who had not been consulted. He went to war against the two Baldwins but was not successful. Between 1050 and 1054 Lambert II, Count of Lens fought alongside the Baldwins against Henry III. He was one of Baldwin V's leading vassals. Lambert was killed at the battle of Lille in 1054. Others fighting for the Counts of Flanders against Henry III included the lords of Alost.

Richilde son Roger, from her first marriage, was thought by her not fit to be the next count of Hainaut. Baldwin and Richilde arranged for him to be the Bishop of Chalons. This allowed her son by her second marriage, Baldwin (II) to become the count of Hainaut. Her daughter by her first husband became a nun. Baldwin acquired the remainder of the county of Hainaut by fiefs and by purchasing allods. Baldwin died 17 Jul 1070. His early death left Flanders and Hainaut in the hands of his young son Arnulf III, with Richilde as regent.

Baldwin rebuilt the monastery of Hasnon and gave gifts of his own properties to support it. He placed monks there and made it his burial place.

Baldwin and Richilde were the parents of:

Battle of Cassel (1071)

The Battle of Cassel was fought on 22 February 1071 between Robert the Frisian and his nephew, Arnulf III (son of Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders). The battle was a victory for Robert the Frisian; Arnulf III was killed in the battle. This battle severely weakened the of Flanders.

Arnulf succeeded his father Baldwin in 1070. His mother Richilde, Countess of Mons and Hainaut was his regent. Robert the Frisian, Baldwin VI's brother and Arnulf III's uncle, challenged
Arnulf's succession to Flanders. He began gathering supporters mainly in northern Flanders (where the bulk of Arnulf's forces were located). Arnulf's ranks contained individuals such as Count Eustace II, Count of Boulogne, his son Eustace III, and Godfrey of Bouillon (future king of Jerusalem). Arnulf was also supported by King Philip I of France who knighted Arnulf at the time. His uncle, William the Conqueror sent Arnulf ten Norman knights led by William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford.

Robert's forces attacked Arnulf's larger army before it could organize. Arnulf himself was killed. Also killed in the battle was William FitzOsborn. Captured were Richilde (by Robert's forces) and Robert (by Arnulf III's force). Richilde was exchanged for Robert's freedom. Robert kept the countship of Flanders and ruled a much smaller county until 1093. He gained the friendship of King Philip I of France, by offering him the hand in marriage of his stepdaughter, Bertha of Holland.

Piano Concerto No. 20 (Mozart)

The Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, K. 466 is a piece of music for solo piano and orchestra. It was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart between January and February 1785. Mozart first performed the concerto in Vienna, Austria, on February 11, 1785. The concerto is very dramatic. It has always been popular with musicians and music lovers. 

The Piano Concerto in D minor was written by Mozart between the third week of January 1785 and February 10 of the same year. The next day, his father Leopold Mozart arrived in Vienna from Salzburg, Austria for a 10-week stay. That evening, Mozart performed the concerto at the Mehlgrube Casino. Leopold wrote his daughter Nannerl: "We arrived at 1 o'clock ... the copyist was still copying the new concerto and your poor brother did not have enough time to play through the Rondo because he had to supervise the copying ... On the same evening we drove to the first of his six subscription concerts. A great many members of the aristocracy were present. They each pay three ducats for these Lenten concerts ... Your brother is giving them at the Mehlgrube ... The concert was magnificent and the orchestra played splendidly ... A female singer from the Italian theatre sang two arias then we had the new and very fine concerto." Mozart played the concerto again at the Burgtheater on February 15, 1785.

The Piano Concerto in D minor is a moody, chromatic work of passionate, troubled, and dramatic outbursts. The work was a favorite of 19th century musiciansin spite of its 75-measure "happy ending" in D major. Nineteenth century musicians typically did not like "happy endings" in intensely dramatic, turbulent works such as this concerto. The Piano Concerto in D minor is the first of only two concertos Mozart wrote in minor keys. The other is the Piano Concerto in C minor.

The Piano Concerto in D minor is written for solo piano, flute, 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani, and strings. This was the first time Mozart used trumpets and drums in a piano concerto.

Mozart did not write cadenzas for the concerto. His son, Franz Xavier Wolfgang Mozart, was a pianist-composer who had the concerto in his repertory, and wrote cadenzas for it.
Beethoven also had the D minor concerto in his repertory though he did not usually perform the compositions of other composers. He did however perform the Piano Concerto in D minor several times. He wrote cadenzas for the first and third movements. In his cadenza for the first movement, Beethoven plunges the listener into a world of powerful, frightening, and intense drama.



Words with Friends

Words with Friends is a multi-player word game by Zynga. Players take turns to place words like crosswords on a board, similar to Scrabble. Up to 30 games can be played at the same time. Notifications are used to tell users when it is their turn. Players can find friends by their username, or by Facebook.

The game was released in July 2009. It can be played across the operating systems operating systems Android, Windows Phone and iOS (iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch). It can also be played on Facebook, Kindle Fire, and Nook Tablet. In the game is an unreliable chat feature, which allows opponents to send messages to each other. From 2010 to 2011 Words with Friends was one of the top games in the iOS app store. It can be played as a free version with advertisements, or a paid version without ads.

The rules of the game are essentially the same as Scrabble. Some features are different, such as where bonus tiles are, and the points scored by some letters. Players have 7 randomly picked tiles. These tiles are filled whenever some are played on the board until all of the tiles have been used. Players take turns putting words on the board. If they do not play a word, they can swap tiles with ones not yet used, or pass their turn. Words can be placed up and down, or left and right. Players want to score as many points as they can.

The game ends when a player has no more tiles, and there are no more tiles in the bag. After the last tile is played, the other player will lose points for the total score of their tiles. These points are given to the person who played the final move. The player with the highest score wins.

Players can move their tiles around. They can also reorder them by pressing a button or shaking the device. Players can quit games if they want to. The game has two more features, "tile bag" and "word-o-meter", both can be used for free. 

173,000 words can be played. The list of words used is based on the Enhanced North American Benchmark Lexicon (ENABLE).

The game was made by brothers Paul and David Bettner. They were the owners of Newtoy Inc. at the time.

In 2012, Zynga produced many physical board games of "Words with Friends" in association with Hasbro. There is a normal version, a "Luxe" version with a board that turns, and a "To Go" travel version

Ableism

Ableism or ablecentrism is prejudice towards disabled people. The first known use of the word was in 1981, which makes it relatively new. However, the concept of ableism existed before this. 'Disablism' can be used to mean the same thing.
Ableism can be intentional or unintentional. People can be ableist (prejudiced towards disabled people) unintentionally because ableism is so common that people may not notice that it exists. A person who holds such a prejudice is called an "ablecentrist". Some people say that ableism is a form of oppression. Not everyone who talks about ableism agrees about what things are ableist. Disabled people can be ableist, to other disabled people or to themselves, which is called internalized ableism. Some people deny that ableism exists. 
In some countries, there are laws that are made to protect disabled people from ableist discrimination and Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities also prohibits such discriminations.

Ableism takes many forms around the world. Sometimes ableism is done in a way that is supposed to be hurtful. Other times people are ableist while they are trying to be nice. Both of these types of ableism are harmful.

Society is not built for disabled people. For example, there are lots of shops that are not accessible for people who use wheelchairs because the person who made the shop was able-bodied so they didn't consider that people in wheelchairs wouldn't be able to move around comfortably, or they thought of this but didn't care.

Disabled people are often victims of abuse. The people who abuse them are usually people without disabilities. They may be abused because their disability makes them vulnerable. Sometimes a person is abused just because they are disabled. This is called disability hate crime. A disability hate crime can take the form of murder. A lot of these murders are by care givers such as the mothers of disabled people. A hate crime does not have to be to a person directly. For example, a person might write an ableist slur on a disabled person's car to make them feel bad about being disabled. Many thousands of disability hate crimes are reported every year around the world. Disability hate crimes are often not reported. This means that the statistics make the problem seem smaller than it is.

A common way that disabled people are abused is 'disability bullying'. People think of bullying as something that just happens to children at school that is not serious. This is not true. Bullying happens to people of all ages. Bullying causes long-term psychological problems such as low self-esteem. Some people kill themselves because they have been bullied. Mencap, a charity that helps people with intellectual disability, asked over 500 disabled children and young people about bullying in a survey. 8 out of 10 children with a learning disability said that they are bullied and are scared to go out because they are scared they will be bullied.

More than 90% of developmentally disabled people are sexually abused in their lifetimes. 49% are sexually abused more than 10 times. The rate of sexual abuse in the general population is lower.

81% of non-disabled people who are at the age that people work have a job. 48% of disabled people who are at the age that people work have a job. 50% of disabled people who don't have a job want to have a job, but can not find a job. Sometimes disabled people are not given jobs even if they are capable of doing the jobs because the people giving the jobs (employers) think that disabled people are not as good as non-disabled people.

The English language has been criticised for being ableist. For example, young people sometimes say that something is 'retarded' when they mean that it is bad. This can be offensive to disabled people.

In World War Two, many thousands of disabled people were murdered by Nazis. The Nazis did this because they believed in non-voluntary euthanasia and forced eugenics, which is a philosophy that advocates reproduction by humans with 'desirable' traits and discourages reproduction by humans with 'undesirable' traits. They thought that disability is bad and disabled people are a burden on society. Many people still believe those things. In 2013 a councillor in Cornwall called Colin Brewer said that disabled children 'should be put down' to save money. He was found guilty of misconduct but the council could not fire him.

Disabled people are sometimes forcibly sterilized. This is often illegal because reproduction is considered a human right. 
According to "The Telegraph", people in the UK are trying to change a government law that makes it legal to have an abortion up to 40 weeks in a pregnancy if the fetus is disabled.

In 2011, a book called "Scapegoat: Why we are failing disabled people" was published. The book was written by Katharine Quarmby. It is about hate crimes towards disabled people in the United Kingdom.

Sports are often an area of society in which ableism is evident. In sports media, athletes with disabilities are often portrayed to be inferior. When athletes with disabilities are discussed in the media, there is often an emphasis on rehabilitation and the road to recovery, which is inherently a negative view on the disability. Oscar Pistorius is a South African runner who competed in the 2004, 2008, and 2012 Paralympics and the 2012 Olympic games. Pistorius was the first double amputee athlete to compete in the Olympic games. While media coverage focused on inspiration and competition during his time in the Paralympic games, it shifted to questioning whether his prosthetic legs gave him an advantage while competing in the Olympic games.

Soledad Mexia

Soledad Mexia (August 13, 1899 – August 30, 2013) was a Mexican-American supercentenarian who at the time of her death was the world's fifth-oldest living person and the oldest living resident of California. She was a previous titleholder for the oldest Mexican-born person ever, until being surpassed by Dominga Velasco (1901 - 2015).

Soledad Mexia was born in La Noria, Sinaloa, Mexico, on August 13, 1899. She had seven children, 24 grandchildren, 45 great-grandchildren and two great-great grandchildren, and lived most of her life in San Diego, California, United States.

On August 30, 2013, Mexia died from natural causes, seventeen days after her 114th birthday, at a hospice in Chula Vista, California.

Nintendo 2DS

The Nintendo 2DS is a handheld game console made by Nintendo. It is a new version of Nintendo's Nintendo 3DS console that has a flat design like the Game Boy consoles (instead of the flip design (a design where two or more sections fold by a hinge) of the 3DS), and does not play 3DS games in 3D. It was announced on August 27, 2013. It was released on October 12, 2013 in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. It is aimed at children under the age of seven, whom Nintendo had said should not use the 3D mode on the 3DS due to possible health problems that it could cause. It costs less than the 3DS. In North America, it costs $129.99 (£109.99 in the UK), compared to the $169.99 (£134.99 in the UK) price of the 3DS.

The Nintendo 2DS was discontinued in 2019 in Japan and worldwide in 2020.

Lance Storm

Lance Evers (born April 3, 1969) is a semi-retired Canadian professional wrestler known under the ring name Lance Storm and is best known for his time in known for his work in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Ring of Honor (ROH).

He currently runs a professional wrestling school in Calgary, Alberta called Storm Wrestling Academy.

He joined Extreme Championship Wrestling in 1997. He competed for ECW from 1997 to 2000. During that time, he won the ECW World Tag Team Championship with Chris Candido. They held the belts for 200 days and broke up. They feuded with each other after that and Storm introduced Tammy Lynn Bytch as his manager. The name Tammy Lynn Bytch was a parody of Candido's real life girlfriend Tammy Lynn Sytch.

After their feud was finished, Storm teamed with his trainee Justin Credible and named their tag team the Impact Players. The team won two ECW World Tag Team Championships and feuded with Jerry Lynn and Sabu and Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman. He also worked as a booker in ECW but left for the World Championship Wrestling to support his family when the company began to suffer financial hardships.

He joined World Championship Wrestling in 2000 and won the United States Heavyweight Championship, the Cruiserweight Championship, and the Hardcore Championship in rapid succession. He renamed the titles to the Canadian Heavyweight Championship, 100 kg and Under Championship, and Saskatchewan Hardcore International Title (S.H.I.T.) which also featured large stickers that covered the belts' faceplates.

He was also a member of the wrestling stable Team Canada which also featured Mike Awesome, Jim Duggan, Major Gunns, Carl Oulette, Jacques Rougeau, Elix Skipper and also Bret Hart for one night. The stable feuded with Misfits In Action.

The WCW was purchased World Wrestling Federation in 2001 and portrayed as a serious, humourless heel. He was a member of The Alliance and was also the first WCW wrestler to invade a WWF program on the May 28, 2001 episode of Raw.

During his time in WWF, he won the WWE Intercontinental Championship and formed a tag team with The Hurricane. Storm and Hurricane feuded with the Hardy Boyz over the WWF and WCW Tag Team Titles. Team Alliance lost at the 2001 Survivor Series and Storm was fired (in storyline) along with the rest of the alliance roster by Vince McMahon.

Storm defeated The Rock with help from Test in a match which earned Storm a WWF contract. Storm formed The Un-Americans along with Christian, Test, and later William Regal. The Un-Americans lead angry tirades against the United States and waved an inverted American flag in the ring. Storm and Christian defeated Hulk Hogan and Edge at Vengeance to win the WWE Tag Team Championship.

The stable broke up but Storm continued to tag with Regal with the same type of gimmick. With Regal, Storm won the World Tag Team Championship twice. Regal had health problems and Chief Morley said that they would be stripped of the titles. Morley teamed with Storm and they were named the World Tag Team Champions.

He was involved in a storyline where Stone Cold Steve Austin, who was an authority figure at the time, told the fans to chant "boring" during Storm's matches. Goldust helped improve Storm's charisma and turn Storm into a fan favorite. He reformed his tag team with Morley but they didn't really get a push.

He turned into a heel again and was tired of pleasing the fans and how it was just a waste of his time. He was squashed by Rhyno immediately thereafter which turned Rhyno into a fan favorite once again. This would turn out to be Storm's last appearance on Raw.

In April 2004, he then decided to retire from in-ring action and accepted a position backstage with WWE where he worked as a wrestling trainer in Ohio Valley Wrestling. He resigned from WWE in May 2005 and intended to open his own training school in his hometown of Calgary, the Storm Wrestling Academy. After he left the WWE, Storm competed in the Independent circuit for a while which also included Ring of Honor. He still competes in the independent circuit from time to time.


Since retiring, he runs a professional wrestling school in Calgary, Alberta called Storm Wrestling Academy.

He is married to his wife Tina and they have two daughters, Rachel and Rebecca.


Shoemaking

Shoemaking is the process of making footwear. Originally, shoes were made by handicraft. Few people buy shoes made by old-fashioned methods anymore, preferring cheaper ones made by industrial mass production. The old methods are still used for buyers who want unusually high quality. Shoemakers may produce a range of footwear items, including shoes, boots, sandals, clogs and moccasins. Such items are generally made of leather, wood, rubber, plastic, jute or other plant material.

A cordwainer is a shoemaker who makes very fine soft leather shoes. A cobbler is someone who repairs shoes.

Dynamite Kid

Thomas Billington (December 5, 1958 – December 5, 2018) was a retired British professional wrestler known under the ring name Dynamite Kid and was best known for his time in known for his work in World Wrestling Federation, Stampede Wrestling, All Japan Pro Wrestling and New Japan Pro Wrestling.

He was best known for teaming with his cousin Davey Boy Smith and forming the tag team The British Bulldogs.

He moved to Calgary, Alberta, Canada in 1978 and competed for Stampede Wrestling which also included Bruce Hart, and rookie Bret Hart. He started taking steroids in 1979 when Junkyard Dog, introduced him to Dianabol. Jake Roberts introduced him to speed during his stay in Canada.

After competing in Canada, he travled to Japan and started working for International Pro Wrestling from July 19–25, 1979. Stampede Wrestling switched their business relationship from IPW to New Japan Pro Wrestling shortly after his first tour, and he then wrestled for New Japan from January 4, 1980, to August 2, 1984. During his time in NJPW, he was known for his legendary feud with Tiger Mask. He met Tiger Mask again for the vacant WWF Junior Heavyweight Championship but there was no winner because the match ended up as a draw three consecutive times.

On February 7, 1984, he earned the WWF Junior Heavyweight Championship when he won a tournament in New Japan Pro Wrestling; even though it was a WWF Title, it was mostly defended in Japan. He defeated his cousin Davey Boy Smith earlier in the tournament, and then defeated The Cobra in the finals.

He debuted in the WWF on August 29, 1984 and teamed with Bret Hart where they defeated Iron Mike Sharpe and Troy Alexander in a match that was eventually shown on September 15, 1984, on the Maple Leaf Garden broadcast.

He ended up teaming with Davey Boy Smith and formed the British Bulldogs, while Bret would team with Jim Neidhart and formed The Hart Foundation. The two teams had matches against each other which usually ended in No-Contests. The British Bulldogs, accompanied by Captain Lou Albano and Ozzy Osbourne, defeated Greg Valentine and Brutus Beefcake at WrestleMania II.

During a tag match against Don Muraco and Bob Orton, he was injured. He would be substituted by several wrestlers which included Roddy Piper, Junkyard Dog and Billy Jack Haynes when tag title defenses were made. When he was recovering in the hospital from back surgery, he recounted that Bret Hart had showed up and said that Vince McMahon had sent him to get Dynamite's tag belt but Billington refused. He would shortly check himself out of the hospital (against doctors' orders) and met with McMahon, who requested that the Bulldogs drop the tag titles to the team of Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik but Billington refused and said that he would only drop the belts to The Hart Foundation.

The British Bulldogs wrestled a match on January 26, 1987 and dropped the titles to The Hart Foundation. During the match, he could barely walk due to back surgery and had to be helped to the ring by linking arms with his tag partner Davey Boy Smith. He was knocked out by Jimmy Hart's megaphone early in the match, avoiding his having to wrestle in the match for story purposes.

He was involved in a real-life backstage fight with Jacques Rougeau and the Bulldogs wrestled their last WWF match at the 1988 Survivor Series. He made many enemies during his time in the WWF including Brutus Beefcake because he refused an autograph for Betley who was visiting his old student backstage at a 1986 WWF show, The Honky Tonk Man whom Dynamite claimed had made light of injuries suffered by his friend Harley Race, - an account largely corroborated by Hart - and Jacques Rougeau. Rougeau blamed Dynamite for cutting up his clothes for a prank (which was actually committed by Curt Hennig) and Dynamite in return had confronted and punched Rougeau and his brother Raymond, he ambushed and assaulted Billington with three shots in the face while his fist was loaded with a roll of quarters (including one in the mouth that knocked out four of Dynamite's teeth). Many wrestlers thought he deserved the beating because of Billington's history of bullying. He was known for being a legitimately tough guy and for his stiffness as a worker. Mick Foley told a story of when Kid and Smith wrestled the team of Les Thornton and a young Mick Foley. He said that Billington had manhandled him so badly in the ring that he could not eat solid food for a time, and Billington had tore a ligament in Foley's jaw with his trademark Hook Clothesline move. WWF-champion Randy Savage once specifically asked for Billington to watch his back when he went drinking in a hotel bar which was frequented by NWA wrestlers, including Ric Flair.

The Bulldogs returned to Stampede Wrestling and won the International Tag Team Titles after leaving the WWF. They also competed in All-Japan Pro Wrestling where they were paid $20,000 each by Giant Baba. Davey Boy Smith left to return to the WWF and fabricated a story to the All-Japan office that Billington was in a serious car accident and was unable to compete. Since Davey Boy Smith had trademarked the term "The British Bulldog" during the Bulldogs' previous run in WWF, he decided to return to the WWF under the ring name The British Bulldog, and would send people to the United Kingdom to warn the promoter every time a flyer was distributed which promoted Dynamite Kid as a "British Bulldog". Billington announced his retirement on December 6, 1991 due to years of steroid abuse (which included an incident where he used horse steroids), working a high impact style, and cocaine usage.

He divorced from his first wife Michelle (the sister of Bret Hart's ex-wife Julie) and moved from Canada back home to Wigan, England with his parents. He embarked on another All-Japan tour and visited Dan Spivey where he stayed in his home in Florida for a week. When Spivey came back from vacation, he and Billington took hits of LSD, which resulted in Billington coming close to death twice in one day, but he was revived with adrenaline shots by paramedics both times.

He had his final match on October 10, 1996, at a Michinoku Pro event called "These Days" where he teamed with Dos Caras and Kuniaki Kobayashi against The Great Sasuke, Mil Máscaras, and his greatest rival, Tiger Mask. Billington's body was clearly degenerated to the point where he was practically skin and bones, as the bottom portion of his tights were very loose. In the end, Dynamite delivered his trademark tombstone piledriver on Great Sasuke which lead to Dos Caras powerbombing Sasuke for the pin fall. When he was at the airport to return home the next day, he had a second seizure (as the first one was in 1987, while traveling with the Ultimate Warrior) and was sent to the hospital immediately.

Because of a large amount of back and leg injuries he suffered during his career, he is disabled and uses a wheelchair. He was told he would never walk again. The inventor of the diving headbutt Harley Race, has stated that he regrets ever inventing the move because of the fact that it appears to cause spinal problems, and may have contributed to Billington's disability. Billington also has suffered from heart problems. On November 23, 2013 it was reported that Billington suffered a stroke.

Billington died on December 5, 2018, his 60th birthday in Ince, Cheshire.



Motivation

Motivation is an important part of psychology. It is the driving force by which people (or animals) get what they want. A motive is the reason for an action taken.

Motivation arouses a person to act towards a desired goal. It is a driving force which promotes action. For example, hunger is a motivation which causes a desire to eat. "Motivation is an energizer of behavior". It is the purpose or psychological cause of an action.

With animals, motivation is caused by basic needs: needs for food, water, warmth, safety, mating, protecting the young, defending territory, needs to escape pain and threats... The drive to do these things is instinctive, inborn, and triggered by circumstance.

With humans, whose mental life is much more complex, motivation is more complicated. Obviously, humans feel the need for food and water, avoid pain and so on. But they are also capable of having long-term plans which are more difficult to understand.

A drive or desire is "a deficiency or need that activates behaviour aimed at a goal or an incentive".<ref name="Drive/Desire"></ref>

Drives may arise inside or outside an organism. External drives for humans are rewards and punishments, and can be quite subtle: a frown or a smile may be sufficient for a young person.

Drives often occur "within" the individual and may not need external stimuli to encourage the behaviour. An example is the sexual drive which is driven by our hormone system. The desire for sex is wired deep into the brain of all human beings as glands secrete hormones that travel through the blood to the brain and stimulates the onset of sexual desire. The process is started by the brain's hypothalamus, which releases pulses of GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). This starts a whole chain of reactions which we call "puberty". Longer term, the hormone supporting male sex drive is testosterone, and for women testosterone and oestrogen.

By contrast, outside rewards and stimuli are used in training animals by giving them treats when they perform a trick correctly. The treat motivates the animals to perform the trick consistently, even later when the treat is removed from the process. Children are motivated to learn by approval of friendly adults, and by their own pleasure at success.

Motivation and emotion are intertwined: "Emotional states tend to have motivational properties".

Not all motivated behaviour is the result of conscious decisions. Freudian psychology suggests that much behaviour is motivated by "unconscious factors, working through a network of defence mechanisms, symbolic disguises and psychological cloaks".

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), or Luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), is a hormone synthesized and released from neurons in the hypothalamus.

GnRH occurs in all vertebrates. This single hormone controls all the complex processes which prepare the male and female for successful reproduction.

GnRH releases follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary. 

GnRH activity is very low during childhood, and is activated at puberty or adolescence. During the reproductive years, it is critical for successful reproductive function as controlled by feedback loops. However, once a pregnancy is established, GnRH activity is not required. 

Southern hip hop

Southern hip hop (also known as Southern rap, South Coast hip hop, or dirty south) is a type of hip hop music that comes from the Southern United States. 

Many early Southern rap artists released their music independently or on mixtapes after finding it difficult to obtain record-label contracts in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, many Southern artists had achieved national success. Over the decade, Southern hip-hop varieties, both mainstream and underground, have become among the most popular and influential of the entire genre.

In 2003 a documentary movie called "Dirty States of America: The Untold Story of Southern Hip-Hop" was released.

Around 2-6% of people have dyspraxia. Four times as many males than females have it. It is sometimes called 'clumsy child syndrome', but adults have it too. Most people with dyspraxia have other disabilities such as ADHD or autism And Hypermobility. 

There is no single cause of dyspraxia. It may not appear until later in childhood or sometimes even in adolescence. It cannot be cured: people who have it will live with it for life, however people are able to overcome it and find alternative ways to accomplish tasks which may usually be difficult without support.


People who have developmental coordination disorder may also have one or more of these conditions:

It went into orbit around Mars, and has been studying the planet since then. The main area of study is looking for water on Mars, under the surface of Mars, and in the atmosphere of Mars. To do this, it has the largest telescope ever sent to another planet. The orbiter also works as a communications satellite. Its powerful antennas send and receive messages between NASA on Earth, and rovers on the surface of Mars.

Pippi Longstocking

Pippi Longstocking () is a fictional character who originally appeared in a series of children's books by Swedish author Astrid Lindgren. The character has since adapted into several movies and television series. Pippi means "quirky" in old Swedish slang. She was named by Lindgren's daughter Karin, who was nine years old at the time. She had asked for a story from her mother one day when she was home sick from school.

Pippi is an unusual and spirited nine-year-old girl. She has superhuman strength, and is easily able to lift her horse with one hand. She often mocks and tricks adults she encounters; she usually reserves her worst behaviour for the most condescending adults. Pippi only really gets angry when someone treats her horse badly. Like Peter Pan, Pippi does not want to grow up. She is the daughter of a pirate captain and has adventurous tales to tell. She has four best friends: her horse, a monkey, and the neighbour's children Tommy and Annika.

The first three Pippi Longstocking books were published by Rabén and Sjögren from 1945 to 1948. Another series of six books were published between 1969 and 1975. Two final stories were printed in 1979 and 2000. The books have been translated into 64 languages.

There are three full-length Pippi Longstocking books:

There were three original picture books that were translated into English:

There are many picture books and short books based on parts of chapters from the original three, including:

The first movie about Pippi Longstocking was filmed in 1949. The movie was based on three of the books, but several storylines were changed and characters were removed and added. Pippi's character was played by Viveca Serlachius. It was directed by Per Gunvall and released on October 20, 1950.

An American movie version from Columbia Pictures was released in 1988. It was called "The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking", although it actually just retold the original story. The movie was directed by British director Ken Annakin. It starring Tami Erin as Pippi with Eileen Brennan, Dennis Dugan, John Schuck and Dick Van Patten in supporting roles.

In 1961, the NBC children's television series "Shirley Temple's Storybook" showed an episode about Pippi Longstocking. It was the 15th episode in the show's 2nd season. The 60-minute episode first aired on 8 January 1961. The episode is historically important. It was the first time a child played Pippi in a television or movie adaptation, the first American television or movie adaptation of the book, and the first television or movie adaptation of the book in color.

The episode stars (among others) child actor Gina Gillespie as Pippi Longstocking, Renie Riano as schoolteacher Miss Lindquist, and Tor Johnson as circus strongman Mighty Adolf. Pippi defeats bullies and burglars, and out-performs a circus strongman. The episode has been released to DVD.

A Swedish television series, "Pippi Longstocking", was created in 1968. The stories were based on the books. The first episode was broadcast on Sveriges Radio TV in February 1969. It was a co-production between Sweden and West Germany. Several German actors had roles in the series. Inger Nilsson played Pippi.

Astrid Lindgren had been unhappy with the 1949 adaptation. She wrote the script herself for this version. The series was directed by Olle Hellbom who also directed several other Astrid Lindgren adaptations. This version is the most well-known version in Sweden and other European countries.

A television movie version, "Peppi Dlinnyychulok", was released in 1982 by Mosfilm. It was produced by Margaret Mikalan, and starred Mikhail Boyarsky, Lev Durov and Tatiana Vasilieva. Pippi was played by Svetlana Stupak, and her singing voice was provided by Svetlana Stepchenko.

In 1985, Carrie Kei Heim played Pippi in the "ABC Weekend Special" called "Pippi Longstocking". It was directed by Colin Chilvers. It was shown in two parts: on November 2 and November 9.

Black Eye galaxy

The Black Eye Galaxy (or Sleeping Beauty Galaxy; Messier 64, M64, Evil Eye Galaxy or NGC 4826) was discovered in 1779. It is a fairly close galaxy, just over 24 million light years away.

It has a spectacular dark band of absorbing dust in front of its bright nucleus. This is why it is called the "Black Eye" or "Evil Eye" galaxy. M64 is well known among amateur astronomers because it can be seen in small telescopes. It is a spiral galaxy in the Coma Berenices constellation.

The gas in the outer areas of M64 rotates in the opposite direction to the gas and stars in the inner areas. The inner area has a radius of only about 3,000 light-years, while the outer area extends another 40,000 light-years Many new stars are near the edges between the two areas.

Astronomers think the oppositely rotating gas happened when M64 took in a galaxy that collided with it. This happened over a billion years ago. New stars are forming in the shear region. The shear region is where the oppositely rotating gases collide, are pushed together, and get smaller. 

The image shows hot, blue young stars that have just been made. There are pink clouds of glowing hydrogen gas that fluoresces when exposed to ultraviolet light from newly made stars. The small galaxy that collided with M64 has now been almost completely destroyed. Its stars are either in the main galaxy or scattered into intergalactic space. The motion of gas at the outer edge of M64 is a sign of the ancient collision.

Centaurus A

Centaurus A or NGC 5128 is a prominent galaxy in the constellation of Centaurus. It was discovered in 1826 by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop at his home in New South Wales, Australia. 

NGC 5128 is either a Hubble type lenticular galaxy or a elliptical galaxy. It is 1016 million light-years away.

NGC 5128 is one of the closest radio galaxies to Earth. Its active center has been well studied. The galaxy is the fifth brightest in the sky, and is an ideal amateur astronomy target. The galaxy is only visible from low northern latitudes and the southern hemisphere.

Spitzer Space Telescope studies have confirmed that Centaurus A is colliding with, and devouring, a smaller spiral galaxy. Like other starburst galaxies, the collision produced the intense burst of star formation. 

The center of the galaxy has a supermassive black hole. Its mass is about 55 million solar masses. This ejects a relativistic jet with emissions in the X-ray and radio wavelengths. Astronomers have taken radio observations of the jet ten years apart. They found that the inner parts of the jet are moving at about half the speed of light. X-rays are produced further out as the jet collides with surrounding gas. This produces highly energetic particles. The radio jets of Centaurus A are over a million light years long.

Marble Arch

Marble Arch is a white Carrara marble monument which is on a large traffic island. It is at the junction of Oxford Street, Park Lane, and Edgware Road, almost directly opposite Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park in the City of Westminster, London.

Historically, only members of the royal family and the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, have been allowed to pass through the arch in ceremonial procession.

The name "Marble Arch" today usually refers to the area in West London where the arch is, at the southern end of Edgware Road. There is also a Marble Arch underground station nearby.

Until 1851 it stood in front of Buckingham Palace. The arch was designed in 1825 by John Nash as a ceremonial entrance to the courtyard of the new Buckingham Palace. He was rebuilding the palace from the former Buckingham House. The palace, as designed by Nash, was laid out around three sides of the courtyard, with the Marble Arch placed on its open eastern side.

Thou (unit)

The thou (abbreviation th) or mil (mainly United States) is a unit of length in the Imperial System and the United States Customary Units. It is equal to of an inch. This is not to be confused with the old form of "you".

Thou comes from the Germanic languages, a shortening of "thousandth".

Mil comes from the Romance languages, a shortening of "mille".

The thou was introduced in 1844 by Joseph Whitworth as a substitute to traditional fractions such as which cannot be defined simply in hundredths unlike (0.25) or (0.5). Traditional fractions continued to be used, as they were a substantial part of other units of length.

The thou is used in engineering and manufacturing mostly.

Yard

The Yard (abbreviation yd, plural sometimes yds) is a unit of length in the Imperial System and United States Customary Units.

A yard has always been 3 feet, although the length of a foot has changed frequently throughout history. In 1959, the International Yard and Pound Agreement was signed between the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, the United States, New Zealand and Canada. It was defined as 0.9144 metres. The United States continued to use the old yard under the name 'Survey Yard'

Roadsigns in the United Kingdom are in miles and yards, rarely in Canada and the Republic of Ireland. It can also be used as a measure of area (square yard) and as a measure of volume (cubic yard). It is also used to measure pitches and fields for a number of sports that originated from English speaking countries. It finds seldom use in other metricated Commonwealth Nations.
