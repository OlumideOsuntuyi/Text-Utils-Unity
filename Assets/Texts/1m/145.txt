Dodge WC series

The Dodge WC series, sometimes nicknamed 'Beeps', were a prolific range of light 4WD and medium 6WD military utility trucks, produced by Dodge / Fargo during World War II. Together with the ⁄-ton jeeps produced by Willys and Ford, the Dodge ⁄‑tons and ⁄‑tons made up nearly all of the light 4WD trucks supplied to the U.S. military in WWII – with Dodge contributing some 337,500 4WD units (over half as many as the jeep).

Contrary to the versatility of the highly standardized jeep, which was mostly achieved through field modification, the Dodge WC‑series came in many different, purpose-built, but mechanically uniform variants from the factory, much akin to the later family of High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles. The WC series evolved out of, and was part of a more extended family of trucks, with great mechanical parts commonality, that included open- and closed-cab cargo trucks and weapons carriers, (radio) command cars, reconnaissance vehicles, ambulances, carryalls, panel vans, and telephone installation and mobile emergency / field workshop trucks.

The Dodge WC series were essentially built in two generations. From 1940 to early 1942, almost 82,400 of the ⁄‑ton 4×4 Dodge trucks were built — initially called the VC series, but the great majority (from 1941) in the WC series, and in more variants. Contrary to what the nomenclature would suggest, the 1941 WC models were a direct evolution of the 1940 VC models, retaining the U.S. Army's G-505 Ordnance Corps Supply Catalog number.

In 1942, the payload was upgrated, and the trucks grew into the G-502 ⁄-ton 4×4 Truck (Dodge) and the G-507 1⁄‑ton 6x6 personnel and cargo truck (Dodge) — confusingly retaining the Dodge WC model code. Although the ⁄‑tons featured significant design improvements, they did retain some 80% interchangeable components and service parts with the ⁄‑ton models — a vital Army requirement, for field maintenance and operability of the trucks.

Dodge was the U.S. Army's main supplier of ⁄‑ton trucks, and its sole supplier of both ⁄‑ton trucks and 1⁄‑ton 6x6 trucks in World War II. With over a quarter million units built through August 1945, the G-502 ⁄‑tons were the most common variants in the WC‑series.

After the war, Dodge developed the ⁄-ton WC‑series into the civilian 4×4 Dodge Power Wagon; and in 1951, the WCs were replaced by the very similar ⁄‑ton 4x4 Dodge M-series vehicles .

Though the majority of Dodges built were 'Weapons Carriers', "WC" was not abbreviated from this, but a general Dodge model code – initially "W" for 1941, and "C" for a (nominal) half-ton payload rating. However, the "WC" model code was simply retained after 1941 — for both the ⁄-ton, as well as the 1⁄‑ton rated 6x6 Dodges.

All in all, not counting mechanically related variants, the WC series alone involved 52 model versions (thirty ⁄‑ton 4×4, eight ⁄‑ton 4×2, twelve ⁄‑ton 4×4, and two 1⁄‑ton 6×6 models). Creating vehicles of a common platform in such a variety of designs, with payloads ranging from ⁄‑ton to 1⁄‑tons, had no equal in its time, and is seen as an extraordinary feat of the WWII American auto industry.

Hiyangthang Lairembi Temple

The Hiyangthang Lairembi Temple (, ) is an ancient temple of Goddess Hiyangthang Lairembi (also known as Irai Leima) of Meitei religion (Sanamahism). The sacred building is situated on the hilltop of Heibok Ching in the Hiyangthang, Manipur. Thousands of devotees thronged at the holy site during the festival time of Lai Haraoba of Sanamahism as well as Durga Puja of Hinduism.

The worship of Goddess Hiyangthang Lairembi (alias Irai Leima) was started by the reign of King Senbi Kiyaamba (1467-1508 AD) in Manipur. Right from his era, Sarangthem family members hold grand feasts (Chaklen Katpa) every year in honor of the goddess.

In the 18th century AD, during the reign of King Garib Niwaj (alias "Pamheiba"), Goddess Hiyangthang Lairembi (alias Irai Leima) was converted to Hindu goddess Kamakhya (a form of Durga). The 3rd day of Durga Puja is celebrated as the "Bor Numit" (literally, Boon Day) in the temple.

On the 22nd of March, 1979, an association was formed to worship Hiyangthang Lairembi (Ireima), the traditional goddess.

Irai Leima (later known as Hiyangthang Lairembi) was an exceptionally beautiful princess of Heibok Ching. King Heibok Ningthou, her father was a wizard and black magician. One day, King Kwakpa (Kokpa) of Khuman dynasty saw Irai Leima fishing in the Liwa river. He fell in love with her. He proposed her. Her answer was that her parents' wish will be her wish. So, King Kwakpa and his subjects presented Heibok Ningthou many gifts. King Kwakpa was about to marry Irai Leima if her father didn't reject or to bring her by force if her father rejected. Seeing the immodesty of Khuman Kwakpa, Heibok Ningthou turned all the presents into stone. Kwakpa returned home disappointed.

One day, King Kwakpa got drunk with a juice of the roots of Tera plant ("Bambax malabaricum"). He went to meet Irai Leima, riding on a Hiyang boat. Seeing him coming, she fled to Pakhra Ching. Kwakpa followed her. Seeing all these, Heibok Ningthou turned the Hiyang boat into stone and the oar into a growing tree. Getting furious, Kwakpa turned on Heibok Ningthou to kill him. Then, Heibok Ningthou turned Khuman Kwakpa also into a stone. Irai Leima saw all this and was frightened. She ran away from her own father. She passed the Pakhra Ching, crossed the Liwa river and hid herself inside the grain storehouse of Sarangthem Luwangba. When Luwangba and his good lady Thoidingjam Chanu Amurei left the house for paddy field, Irai Leima came out from her hideout. Meanwhile, she did all the household works for them. When they returned home, she also returned to her hideout again. They were amazed at this but it happened daily. So, one day, the man returned home earlier than normal timing. He found out what was really going on. But when he came near Irai Leima, she was gone below the grain storehouse. He saw nothing under the granary. He was astonished at this. So, he discussed the matter with his clan members. They searched her everywhere but didn't find her anymore.

Irai Leima came to the dream of Sarangthem Luwangba. She told him that she was merged into his clan and became his daughter. The story was told to King Senbi Kiyaamba of Ningthouja dynasty. The King sent maibas and maibis to inspect the case. The maibas and the maibis concluded the strange lady to be a goddess and the deity to be worshipped. King Kiyaamba told Luwangba to worship her. From that year onwards, Irai Leima was worshipped as a goddess.

The first day on which Luwangba saw Irai Leima was the first Monday of the Meitei lunar month of "Lamta (Lamda)". And the day on which the maibas and maibis examine the case was the first Tuesday of "Lamta (Lamda)". Even today, right from the era of King Senbi Kiyaamba (1467-1508 AD), the Sarangthem family members organise a grand feast ("Chaklen Katpa") in honor of the goddess every year. Later, Irai Leima came to be known as Hiyangthang Lairembi.

Devotees believe that Goddess Hiyangthang Lairembi (alias Irai Leima) fulfills one's wish if asked for a blessing on the "boon day" at the right time. The boon day (Bor Numit) coincides with the third day of Hindu festival Durga Puja.

Dendropsophus bromeliaceus

Teresensis' bromeliad frog ("Dendropsophus bromeliaceus") is a frog that lives in Brazil. Scientists have only seen it in the mountains in the Reserva Biológica Augusto Ruschi.\

The adult male frog is 16.1–18.4 mm long from nose to rear end. This frog is light brown in color with a wide, cream-colored stripe down each side of its body from the eye to where the legs meet the body. There is another stripe in the middle of the back. There is a triangular mark on the face. The hind legs are cream in color and the front legs and belly are gray. The iris of the eye is black in color.

This is the only frog in "Dendropsophus" whose tadpole swims in rainwater. Instead of laying eggs in a stream or pond, the female finds a place where the leaves of bromeliad plants have formed a bowl with rainwater in it. The tadpoles swim and grow in the water.

Scientists think this frog might be territorial: adult frogs might fight each other for good places to find food and lay eggs. They think the male frogs might help feed and guard the tadpoles.

Scientists named this frog Teresensis meaning "person born in the town of Santa Teresa." They gave it the scientific name "bromeliaeus"' after the bromeliad plants where it lays its eggs.

Krishnachandra Roy

Krishnachandra Roy (Bengali: রাজা কৃষ্ণচন্দ্র রায়, 1710-1783) was the king of Nadia. His role in the history of Bengali literature, Bengali culture and Bengali Hindu society is unforgettable. Nadia is considered as the best man of the royal family. He was a scholar, educated in Sanskrit and Persian, and a musician. Krishnachandra, an intensely conservative king, was the patron of the proverbial geniuses of Bengal, such as Ramprasad Sen of Shaktapadavali, Bharat Chandra Raigunakar, the author of the Annadamangal poem, and the humorous Gopal Bhar. Annadamangal Kavya was composed in his royal court. The world famous pottery of Krishnanagar was started on his initiative.

Krishnachandra Roy was a man of strategy. When Nawab Sirajuddaula clashed with the British, he sided with the British. He was captured during the reign of the next Nawab Mir Qasim. He was released due to the intervention of the English. The Company Government conferred the title of Maharaja on him for his loyalty.

His achievement is the worship of Jagadhatri in Bengal and the introduction of Shaktras in Navadvipa. According to legend, Krishnachandra was imprisoned in 1754 for failing to pay taxes to Nawab Alivardi Khan of Bengal. The time was near Durgotsab. When the fort festival was almost over when he was finally released from the Nawab's prison, on his way back to Krishnanagar, the king realized that it was Vijaya Dashami. The king fell asleep in the boat and there he saw in a dream that a purple quadrilateral virgin goddess was telling him to worship her on the Shuklanabami date of the next month of Kartik. As a result, Jagadhatri Puja was introduced. The following year, Jagadhatri Puja was introduced in Chandannagar by his friend Indranarayan Chowdhury. Also, Maharaja Krishnachandra initiated the worship of the idol of Malopara Baroari Jagadhatri (Mother Jaleshwari).

Marcian

Marcian (; ; ; 392 – 26 January 457) was Roman emperor in the east of the Roman Empire from 450 to 457 AD. 

He was a soldier who worked for the generals Ardabur and his son Aspar for fifteen years. When the emperor Theodosius II died on 28 July 450, Marcian was made a candidate to be emperor by Aspar. Aspar had power because he controlled the Roman army.

After a month of negotiation, Pulcheria, Theodosius' sister, agreed to marry Marcian. Zeno, a man with almost as much power as Aspar, may have been part of these negotiations. Zeno got the high title of after Marcian became emperor, perhaps as a reward. Marcian was inaugurated as Emperor on 25 August 450.

Marcian undid many of the acts of TheodosiusII in the Romans' relations with the Huns (led by Attila) and in the organization of the Christian Church. Marcian soon broke all treaties with Attila, ending all subsidy payments to him. In 452, while Attila and the Huns were attacking the Italian Peninsula (part of the western Roman Empire), Marcian's armies attacked across the Danube river into the Great Hungarian Plain. There the Roman armies overcame the Huns in their own country. Because of this, and because of a famine and epidemic in northern Italy, the western Roman Empire was able to bribe Attila into retreating from the Italian Peninsula.

When Attila died in 453, it was the downfall of the Huns' power. Marcian improved the Romans' position by allowing Germanic peoples to live in Roman lands as allies. They did military service in exchange for this right. Marcian called together the Council of Chalcedon, which agreed that Jesus had two "natures": divine and human. This made the populations of Roman Syria and Roman Egypt Marcian's enemies. People in these places did not agree with this official Christology. 

Marcian died on 26 January 457. At the end of Marcian's life, the Empire's treasury was full of money. There were seven million more gold coins than were needed, even though the cost of the wars and treaties with the Huns had been high. After Marcian died, Aspar decided against Marcian's son-in-law Anthemius being emperor. Aspar used his power to make Leo I emperor.

In June 2019, the platform became available in more than 50 countries, including Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, Italy and more.

Rentberry offers a decentralized platform for landlords and tenants, based on a transparent process for submitting and reviewing rental applications, online payments, a risk assessment system for potential tenants and homeowners. Rent is paid through the website To do this, Rentberry works with HelloSign, offering tenants and landlords to sign sign legally binding documents digitally on the platforms.

Rentberry also uses the DataUSA.io API service and database, providing tenants with information about the area where the tenant is looking for housing, including population, average age, poverty rate, average income, average property value, and more.

On September 10, 2018, Rentberry launched mobile applications for tenants and landlords on both iOS and Android.

Reports say the Seattle City Council plans to extend the moratorium for another year. As of June 2019, Rentberry is agglomerating the lists (boards) of rental housing in Seattle, as the moratorium has not yet been extended.

Contraposition

In logic and math, contraposition is the right way to reverse "if-then" statements. For example, the contrapositive of the sentence ""If it is raining, then I wear my coat"" is the sentence ""If I don't wear my coat, then it isn't raining."" If the original sentence is correct, the contrapositive is always correct. 

It is easier to see how contraposition is the right way to reverse an if-then statement by looking at two other reversals that can sometimes look similar, but are bad logic:

Inversion

""If it is not raining, then I don't wear my coat."" This is wrong as one can wear a coat for other reasons (eg. It is snowing). In this statement, we have made both the "if" and the "then" statements negative. 

Conversion

""If I wear my coat, then it is raining."" This is wrong as wearing a coat doesn't cause it to rain. In this statement we have switched the "if" and "then" statements. 

In technical writing: the contrapositive of formula_1 is formula_2. The "formula_3" means "if-then" (If P then Q), and the "formula_4" means "not P" (eg. "it is not raining").

In the division of the land of 1392/93, the former duchy of Upper Bavaria and the northern Gaulish possessions, which Duke Otto V had received from Emperor Charles IV in 1373 as compensation for the Mark of Brandenburg, were split into two parts of roughly equal budgetary value: the highly fragmented Bavaria-Ingolstadt and the territorially much more coherent Bavaria-Munich.

The partial duchy of Bavaria-Munich essentially consisted of two areas separated by a narrow strip near Indersdorf, which belonged to Bavaria-Landshut. The northern part extended from Riedenburg an der Altmühl via Neustadt an der Donau and Vohburg to Mainburg and Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm. The larger southern part, located on the Isar River, was bounded on the west by the Lech River. It stretched from Dachau, Fürstenfeldbruck and Munich in the north to Starnberg, Wolfratshausen, Aibling and Tölz and on to Kochelsee and Walchensee in the south. In addition, Regenstauf and Stadtamhof north of the imperial city of Regensburg belonged to Bavaria-Munich. Nominally, Schwandorf, Burglengenfeld, Velburg and Hemau in the northern Gau were also part of the duchy, but they had already been pledged to the Palatine Wittelsbach dynasty around 1350.

In the 1420s, the dukes of Bavaria-Munich were able to significantly expand their territory. After the Bavarian War (1420-1422), they received the area around Ebersberg and Markt Schwaben from Bavaria-Ingolstadt, and in the Prussburg arbitration award of 1429, they were granted about half of the Straubinger Ländchen. This meant that large parts of the Bavarian Forest around Fürth, Kötzting and Regen, as well as a wide strip south of the Danube with Kelheim and the royal seat of Straubing, fell to Bavaria-Munich.

After the death of the last duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt in 1447, Bavaria-Landshut took over the territory of his duchy, while Bavaria-Munich went largely empty-handed. In the Landshut War of Succession, which broke out after the extinction of the Landshut line in the male line in 1503, the Munich duke Albrecht IV was finally able to secure almost the entire territory of the united duchies of Bavaria-Landshut and Bavaria-Ingolstadt, but he had to cede the "Land im Gebirg" around Kufstein, Kitzbühel and Rattenberg as well as Mondsee to Austria and possessions in the northern Gau and on the Danube to the newly created duchy of Palatinate-Neuburg. The Duchy of Bavaria-Munich, enlarged by Albrecht IV, is again referred to simply as Bavaria.

Flag of Kangleipak

The Flag of Kangleipak or Salai Taret Flag is a rectangular seven coloured flag. It represents the seven clan dynasties of the Meitei ethnicity of Ancient Manipur. Red colour represents Mangang, White represents Luwang, Black represents Khuman, Yellow represents Angom, Red mixed with black represents Moirang, Purple represents Kha-Ngangba and Sky blue represents Salai-Leisangthem. The width to length ratio of the flag should be 2:3. This flag is approved by the Lainingthou Sanamahi Temple Board.

After careful analysis of the Puya, it has been determined that this flag symbolizes the birth of Ibudhou Pakhangba's seven sons, who in turn represent the seven clans. Each son was born at a distinct time of day, reflected in the color scheme of the flag, inspired by the hues of the sun during their respective births. This flag serves as a testament to the rich heritage and lineage of our people, honoring the diverse identities within our community.

Since those colours are the result of several dyeing histories, they are more than just a "flag" It's a sacred one. Even now, Amaibas & Amaibis continue to dye fabrics for "Apok khuramba" using those 7 hues.

Darya Chultsova

Darya Chultsova (Belarusian: Дар’я Дзмітрыеўна Чульцова, Russian: Дарья Дмитриевна Чульцова) (born on February 20, 1997, in Shklow, Mogilev Region, Belarus) is a journalist from Belarus. She worked for the television channel Belsat TV. She showed the event at the place where Raman Bandarenka was beaten to death in 2020. She was arrested there on November 15, 2020, in Minsk.

She was born in Shklow. At an early age, she became interested in journalism. While at university, she worked for the website "Mogilev.Online". She studied in the Department of Journalism of Mogilev State A. Kuleshov University, finishing in 2020. In 2020, she moved to the TV channel Belsat and worked there as a journalist.

Together with journalist Katsyaryna Andreeva, she became a person in a criminal case on organizing actions that attack public order. Both showed the event of a cruel attack of the police at the place where Raman Bandarenka was beaten to death and the people stood to support the dead one live. That took place at the "" ("Ploscha Peramen") in Minsk on November 15, 2020.

She was not freed after the arrest there. Darya was moved to a prison in Zhodzina, where she was held until her court trial.

2021 Suez Canal incident

On 23 March 2021, "Ever Given", a container ship, got stuck on the shore of the Suez Canal in Egypt. The ship was 400 meters long. A sand storm and strong winds of up to made it hit the banks in the canal. Authorities said that this was not the main reason for the accident and that something probably went wrong with the ship or the crew made a mistake. The accident stopped any other vessels from passing through the canal.

By 27 March, four days after the ship got stuck, over 300 ships were lined up to pass through the canal while they waited for the problem to be fixed. On March 29th, 2021, the ship was finally free to move again. However, the event made a major impact on the global economy, because all cargo ships traveling across the Suez Canal were delayed.

The Suez Canal is one of the world's most important trading routes. It was opened in 1869. By 2021 around fifty ships travel through the canal each day. This is about 12% of total global trade. When it was built, the canal was basically one way, with a part in the middle where ships could pass each other. Today, ships can pass each other in many parts of the canal. Where this is not possible, groups of ships must take turns. The canal is being expanded, but most parts are still single-lane.

"Ever Given" was first put into the water on 9 May 2018, and started operating on 25 September 2018. The owner is Shoei Kisen Kaisha, a company of Japan's Imabari Shipbuilding. The operator is the Taiwan-based company Evergreen Marine and the vessel is managed by Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement. The vessel is registered in Panama. The ship's owners have insurance cover for $3.1 billion. Evergreen's Protection and Indemnity (third party) liabilities insurance cover is provided by mutual UK P&I Club. The ship is insured in the Japanese market. Insurance industry sources say the ship's owners could be facing insurance claims from the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) for loss of money and other ships who were stuck behind it. Container ships of this size are usually insured for hull and machinery damage of between $100 and $140 million.

Bill Kavanagh, a National Maritime College of Ireland lecturer and former captain, has said that sailing through the Suez canal was very difficult, and risky. Wind can cause the container areas of vessels to act like a sail and affect the course of the ship. Also, once a heavy ship like the "Ever Given" starts to go off the path, it's hard to steer.

The government of Egypt requires ships traveling through the canal to be boarded by an Egyptian "Suez crew", including one or more official maritime pilots from Egypt's SCA. These people command the ship, taking over from the regular crew. There were two Egyptian SCA pilots on board at the time of the accident.

"Ever Given" was travelling from Tanjung Pelepas, Malaysia, to Rotterdam, Netherlands. It was fifth in a northbound convoy, with fifteen vessels behind it when it got stuck near the village of Manshiyet Rugola. On 23 March 2021, at 07:40 EGY (05:40 UTC), the "Given" was travelling through the Suez Canal when it was caught in a sandstorm. The strong winds, which reached , resulted in the "loss of the ability to steer the ship," and caused the hull to change direction. The "Ever Given" then hit the bank at the mark (measured from Port Said on the Mediterranean Sea; from Suez Port on the Gulf of Suez). The ship turned sideways, and blocked the canal. The crew of the "Ever Given", was accounted for, and no injuries were reported. At this point, the Suez Canal is a single waterway.

Evert Lataire, head of maritime technology division at the University of Ghent, looked at the situation and found that the bank effect may have contributed to the grounding. This effect causes the stern of a ship to swing toward the near bank when operating in constricted waterway. Other forces were winds pushing the ship from the side. Since most of the focus of modern ship design is directed towards efficiency and stability at sea, the effects of hydrodynamics in shallow waters need to be studied further.

Over 200 vessels at both ends of the canal were stopped by "Ever Given", including five other container ships of similar size. These included 41 bulk carriers and 24 crude tankers. The vessels represented roughly 16.9 million tonnes of deadweight. Some docked at ports and anchorages in the area, but many remained in place. The ships in the area range from small cargo vessels to large ships, including the Russian Navy Altay-class oiler "Kola", which had been involved in a minor collision with bulk carrier "Ark Royal" earlier that day.

Officials planned to move two vessels from behind "Ever Given" to make room for the refloating operation. Fuel and ballast water were removed from the ship to help lighten it; heavy machinery, including an excavator, worked to dig the bow out. Eight tugboats are assisting in the attempt to pull it free. Peter Berdowski, Chief Executive of Royal Boskalis Westminster, stated that the operation "can take days to weeks".

On 25 March, the Suez Canal Authority stopped navigation through the Suez Canal until the "Given" could be refloated. The same day, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's advisor on seaports stated that he expected the canal to be cleared in "48–72 hours, maximum". The following day, the Suez Canal Authority said that its dredging operations were about 87% complete.

On 26 March, the SCA accepted an offer made by a United States Navy assessment team of dredging experts to assist in efforts to remove the ship.

On 27 March, the SCA said that 14 tugboats were trying to take advantage of that day's high tide and that more would arrive the following day if the latest attempt failed. Yukito Higaki, president of owners Shoei Kisen, reported that the ship did not appear to be damaged, saying "The ship is not taking water. Once it refloats, it should be able to operate." By 5:00 PM GMT, according to Egypt Today, the ship had moved by 30 meters (100 feet) towards the north. Delays in shipping might persist after the "Ever Given" is freed, as vessels may face busy ports and additional delays before offloading. As of 27 March, more than 300 ships were delayed at both ends and in the middle of the canal, with many more still approaching or having altered their paths.

Addressing a press conference, Osama Rabie, SCA Chairman, said that weather conditions were "not the main reasons" for the ship's grounding, adding, "There may have been technical or human errors... All of these factors will become apparent in the investigation."

On 28 March, the Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, ordered preparations for lightening the ship's cargo.

Experts warned that this incident would cause shipping delays for customers around the world. "Lloyd's List" estimated the value of the goods delayed each hour at US $400 million, and that every day it took to clear the obstruction would disrupt an additional US$9 billion worth of goods.

Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research, said that a rise in oil prices was caused by people buying large amounts of oil while prices were low and then selling off oil at higher prices while oil was in shortage: "people buying in after recent declines in oil prices, with the Suez closing the trigger factor". James Williams, energy economist at WTRG Economics said that due to existing stocks "a few days of slowdown in [oil] delivery is not critical to the market." After the Ever Green was freed on 29 March 2021, the oil prices dropped again.

The event will only delay goods, which might only impact industries with existing shortages such as with semiconductors. To act against shortages of goods in the long term, future shipments can be ordered earlier than normal until the difference has been made up. However, a consultant at another firm noted that even a short-term disruption at the Suez Canal would have a domino effect for several months along the supply chain. Some freight forwarders noted that demand for alternative means of transportation was expected to rise within the next few weeks on Europe to Asia routes as a consequence of shippers trying to avoid the disruption and uncertainty caused by the blockage of the canal.

The usual backup route for ships between Asia and Europe is to go around the African continent via the Cape of Good Hope. This route is long and takes 10 to 12 more days. As of March 26, some ships had already taken that route. Russia used this incident to promote its Arctic shipping routes as a shorter alternative to carrying goods around Africa.

Several people have warned that the number of ships with valuable cargo in such a small area may attract pirates. Certain shipping companies already asked for United States fleet, based in Bahrain, to increase security.

Krak de Chevaliers

Krak de Chevaliers () is a castle in Syria. The castle is on a hill and its position means that it can control the nearby valley and two Roman roads. The castle's builders were Crusaders. Between 1144 and 1271 the Knights Hospitaller used the castle. Because scholars have studied the castle and have restored the buildings, people say that Krak de Chevaliers is the best castle that the Crusaders built. The military design of the castle is complex and shows the last development of fortification by during existence of the Crusader states. It is one of the first "concentric castles" (castles with concentric layers of walls). Krak de Chevaliers was an important development in the design of castles, and many other castles' builders copied its design. No army in the Middle Ages ever took the castle by force. UNESCO has named the castle a World Heritage Site. 

Krak de Chevaliers stands on a hill which is high. The hill is at the southern end of the Jabal Ansāriyya mountains, in a position looking over the Homs Gap. Nearby roads carry a trade routes between Antioch and Beirut. The hill has been a fortified place since the 13th century BCE. In 1031 CE, Kurds started to live there in a small castle. In 1110, the Crusaders attacked it took control of the castle. After the Crusaders set up the County of Tripoli, the Knights Hospitaller took control of the castle in 1142. The Knights Hospitaller were the builders of the castle whose ruins remain. The newer castle stands on top of the older 11th-century castle. The oldest buildings there now were built after 1142, when the Knights Hospitaller started to use the place. The first part of the castle to be complete was the centre. At the centre was a building whose shape was an approximation of a triangle. Here are the great hall and kitchens, the chapel, and the granaries, and around these is a thick, strong, masonry wall with towers. When Saladin saw it after his army's victory at the Battle of Hattin, he decided not to attack it.

At the end of the 12th century, the Knights Hospitaller built another defensive wall around the central castle, whereby they closed in of the hill. This wall was also very thick and strong. There are towers at positions along the wall. The first towers to be complete were square in shape, but the later ones were semi-circular. There were two gates with barbicans, one behind the other and joined together by a stone passage with a stone vault. Another postern gate was in the north wall, in a strong position. The Crusaders built many other buildings and made many improvements to the fortifications during this time. The castle was the Hospitallers' headquarters. The Crusaders built the castle's great hall () around 1200. The knights lived together in the great hall. Most of the buildings were complete by around 1220.

After 1170, the castle's chapel was given new frescos. The frescos' painters did the work in a painting style that is like Byzantine art. The Byzantines' influence in the Crusader states was greatest between 1143 and 1169. The builders at Krak de Chevaliers did new work on the great hall building in the style of Gothic architecture.

Krak de Chevaliers was one of several concentric castles that the Knights Hospitaller and the Knights Templar built in the 13th century to stop Muslim armies attacking the Crusader states. The new design was necessary for the repulsion of armies that used new designs of catapults and trebuchets. Krak de Chevaliers had space for large rooms and cisterns with stone vaults. In these rooms and cisterns, the Crusaders could keep enough food and water to eat and drink for many years. The military design meant that the castle was nearly safe from attack. The stores of supplies meant that people in the castle would be safe from a siege. The design of Krak de Chevaliers is one of the best examples of a "concentric castle", along with the castles built by Edward I of England.

The Mamluk leader Baibars attacked Krak de Chevaliers in 1271. His army attacked with trebuchets and catapults. Baibars's army got inside the first wall, but they could not take control of the centre of the castle. Baibars wrote a false letter, which he sent to the Crusaders in the castle. They believed the letter had come from an ally of theirs. The letter said that the Crusaders should surrender. They did surrender, and the Mamluk army of Baibars took control of the castle. After this the Mamluks worked on the castle's buildings. Their builders repaired the buildings and fortifications, and they built a large new tower. The new tower was complete in 1285. (Baibars destroyed many other castles that he took from the Crusaders, but not Krak de Chevaliers.) Unlike many Crusader castles, Krak de Chevaliers continued to be a military position and a centre of government in its area. The castle started to be a town of its own. The frescos in the chapel were whitewashed.

Al-Ansariyyah

Al-Anṣariyyah (or Jabal Ansāriyya, Jebel Ansariye, Djebel Ansariye, Ansariye Mountains, Ansariyah mountains Jabal an Nusayriyah, or Alaouite Mountains, Alawite Mountains (Jibal al-‘Alawiyin) or Syrian coastal range ("Silsilat al-Jibal al-Saheliyya)") is a mountain range in Syria. The mountains range runs in a north–south direction along the coast of Syria. The range is about long. To the west of the mountain range is the plain along the coast, and on the west is the valley of the Orontes. (The Orontes runs through the Ghab Depression.) The tallest mountains in the range are in the north: there their average height is about , but in the south the average mountains are only high. The harbour city Latakia is to the west of the mountain range's highest mountain, which is high. Al-Ansariyyah is the only area of land in Syria which has thick forests. 

At the southern end of the mountain range is the plain (the Homs Gap) which separates it from Mount Lebanon, in the country of Lebanon. On the south end is Krak de Chevaliers, a castle of the Middle Ages. In Classical Antiquity, the fresh water that came from these mountains supplied the cities of Antioch, Seleucia Pieria, Apamea, and Laodicea. Laodicea (now Latakia) was famous for its wine (from vines grown in this region), and the Roman geographer Strabo wrote that most of the wine in Alexandria in Roman Egypt came from Laodicea. Latakia was famous in the more recent past for its tobacco production.

The mountain range is the homeland of the Alawites. In the Middle Ages, during the Crusades, the Order of Assassins lived in these mountains.

People often migrate from the mountains to the plain of the coast and to the valley of the Ghab Depression, for economic reasons.

Backtracking

In computer science, backtracking is a recursive approach for finding solutions to some computational problems. Backtracking gradually finds candidate solutions and abandons candidates, i.e., "backtracks" when a candidate cannot be a good solution.

To apply backtracking to a problem, one must give the data "P" for an instance of the problem that is to be solved, and six procedures, "root", "abandon", "accept", "first", "next", and "save". These procedures should take the instance data "P" as a variable and should do the following:

The backtracking algorithm reduces the problem to the call "backtrack"("root"("P")), where "backtrack" is the following recursive procedure:

The Outlaw Josey Wales

The Outlaw Josey Wales is a 1976 American western movie directed by Clint Eastwood (who also stars). It was based on the 1972 novel "The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales" by Forrest Carter. The movie also stars Chief Dan George, Sondra Locke, Bill McKinney, John Vernon, Paula Trueman, Sam Bottoms, Charles Tyner, Doug McGrath, Geraldine Keams and was distributed by Warner Bros. It was nominated for an Academy Award in 1977 and was followed up by "The Return of Josey Wales" in 1986.

The movie was a commercial success, earning $31.8 million against a $3.7 million budget. In 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". It is sometimes said to be a "revisionist western" because it breaks the "long taboo" about the treatment of Missourians by Unionists. This is disputed.

One of the things which made the film "culturally significant" was its use of character actors who could speak in dialects which are now dead or rare. This happened in countries as television spread the standardised type of pronunciation which the media elite use. Dialects can still be detected in regional speech in the U.S.A., but they are not nearly so prominent as they were.

User experience design

User experience design (UXD, UED, or XD) is the activity to support user behavior through usability, usefulness, and desirability by the interaction with a product.

Experience design ("XD") is the practice of designing products, processes, services, events, etc. with a focus on the quality of the user experience and relevant solutions. Its main purpose is to develop the experience of a product, service, or event by several dimensions:


Research is the first and most important element. It helps to understand the user, identify the application's purpose, and recognize target audience's needs, goals, and mental models.

Visual design ("graphic design, user interface design") shows the aesthetics or general look of any user interface. The purpose is to make a message to its audience using colors, images, and symbols.

Information architecture is the science of structuring and organizing the information in products and services to support usability and findability. It includes information about objects, metadata, page structure and navigation.

It is a kind of interaction between users and products. Nowadays interaction designers are involved in creating contextual interfaces.

It shows how the product can be used by some users with effectiveness and satisfaction in a specified context of use.

Accessibility of a system shows if it is easy and clear to use and understand it, often it refers to the ease of use for people with disabilities and is connected with usability. According to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), all content must follow the four main principles of POUR: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.

Human–computer interaction mostly refers to the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for people's use. It is a 3-in-1 process that combines research and getting ready to design, design and testing.

User Experience Design is not a standalone concept - it entails its relation with other design concepts such as UI, CX & SD.

User Interface (UI) Design covers the design aspects of an interface like the colours, buttons, typography, spacing, images, and more. They bring aesthetic value to a digital product and must be reflective of the brand. Imagine the HSBC logo in a handwriting font.

Customer Experience (CX) Design is the sum of what a customer thinks, feels, sees, hears, and does regarding your brand. From the first touchpoint of scrolling on your brand’s ad on social media to being a loyal customer. Tailored CX Design will ensure that your brand is customer-oriented, elevating the experience. Duolingo is a great example.

Service Design (SD) is the backstage of every product/service. The synergic collaboration between the brand, the employees and the customers focuses on the 3P’s of Services – People, Physical Evidence and Processes. SD arranges the policies, technology, systems and infrastructure to present the front stage to the audience, i.e., products, interfaces, and touchpoints.

Jackson began working as a lawyer in Washington, D.C. She also clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1999 to 2000. Jackson worked in private legal practice from 2000 to 2003.

On July 23, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Jackson to become vice chair of the United States Sentencing Commission. The U.S. Senate confirmed Jackson on February 11, 2010. Jackson was on the Sentencing Commission until 2014. During her time, she helped reduce sentences for people charged with drug offenses.

On September 20, 2012, Obama nominated Jackson to be a judge for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

On February 14, 2013, her nomination was reported to the full Senate by voice vote of the Senate Judiciary Committee. She was confirmed by the full Senate by voice vote on March 22, 2013. Her time in this court was known for ruling against executive decision made by the Trump administration.

On March 30, 2021, President Joe Biden announced his plans to nominate Jackson to be a United States circuit judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to replace Merrick Garland. On April 19, 2021, her nomination was sent to the Senate.

On April 28, 2021, a hearing on her nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee. During her confirmation hearing, some senators questioned her about her rulings against former President Donald Trump. The committee supported her nomination with a 13–9 vote. On June 14, 2021, the United States Senate confirmed Jackson in a 53–44 vote.

Jackson was seen as a possible Supreme Court Justice nominee since Joe Biden was elected president. On February 25, 2022, President Joe Biden announced he would nominate Jackson to the United States Supreme Court, replacing retiring Associate Justice Stephen Breyer. 

On February 28, 2022, her nomination was sent to the United States Senate. After the Judiciary Committee vote ended in an 11-11 vote tie, her nomination was advanced on April 4 by a 53–47 procedural vote in the Senate to discharge the committee deadlock vote. This was first time that the Senate has discharged the Judiciary Committee from consideration of a Supreme Court nomination since 1853. Jackson was confirmed by the Senate, 53–47, on April 7, 2022, to replace Breyer. She will become the first black woman on the Supreme Court. She will also be the first Supreme Court justice to have been a public defender. 

Jackson was sworn-in as Associate Justice at the end of the Supreme Court's 2021–2022 term on June 30, 2022.

In 2023, Jackson wrote the sole dissenting opinion in "Glacier Northwest, Inc. v. Teamsters", a case that talked about the power of employers to sue labor unions about the destruction of employer property following a strike. 

Jackson says she does not have a particular judicial philosophy; instead, she says she has a perspective on legal analysis or a "judicial methodology". 

"Politico" reported that "Jackson is popular with liberal legal activists looking to replace Breyer with a justice willing to engage in ideological combat with the court's conservatives."

Since joining the Court at the beginning of the 2022 term, Jackson was the most active participant in oral arguments. She spoke an average of 1,350 words per argument, while the eight other justices each spoke on average fewer than 1,000. On February 28, 2023, Jackson wrote her first majority opinion for a unanimous court in "Delaware v. Pennsylvania".

In January 2022, "The New York Times" said that Jackson had not yet written many publications showing a legal philosophy. This was mainly because she had joined the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit only recently, in the summer of 2021. However, "The Times" said, Jackson's earlier rulings showed a liberal point of view, including her opinions blocking various Trump administration actions. A review of many of her judicial opinions showed that she would likely be as liberal as Justice Stephen Breyer, the justice she replaced.

According to Sahil Kapur, writing for NBC News, "Jackson fits well with the Democratic Party and the progressive movement's agenda" because she is relatively young, has a background as a public defender, and a history of labor-friendly rulings.

"Politico" reported that "Jackson is popular with liberal legal activists looking to replace Breyer with a justice willing to engage in ideological combat with the court's conservatives."

In 1996, Jackson married Patrick G. Jackson. He is the twin brother of former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan's brother-in-law. They have two daughters. She is a protestant.

It originates from sociological changes of the city and creation of unions. The Franco-Prussian War, the fall of the Second Empire, and the advent of the Third Republic, precipitate events. While many notables report an insurrectional context and an armed support from Switzerland, correspondences of James Guillaume and Mikhail Bakunin attest to a confrontation prepared between the end of May and the beginning of June 1871. But with the start of a large repression on May 21 until June 7, any attempt was compromised. Despite the hope of a restart, the months following the idea of an insurrection is definitively abandoned mostly with extinction of the groups and activities called anarchists in 1875.

Ahl Iman

Ahl Iman (; meaning people of faith), is a Persian term related to religion that is used by Iranian Shia Muslim scholars, author and translator of the Quran Mirza Mahdi Elahi Qomshehei (1901 - 1973) in his Persian translation of the Quran, which is used to describe another variant of the Quranic Arabic sign words يأيها الذين آمنوا, which means o you who believe in the English language, of which the term soon used in various translations of the Quran such as the Urdu translation of the Quran by Fateh Muhammad Jalandhry as اہل ایمان. 

The Persian term is first founded and seen in the Persian translation of the Quran by Mirza Mahdi Elahi Ghomshei. An example of the Quranic verse that contains these words are based below: 

ای اهل ایمان، روزی حلال و پاکیزه‌ای که ما نصیب شما کرده‌ایم بخورید و شکر خدا به جای آرید اگر شما خالص خدا را می‌پرستید. 

English meaning: O people of faith, eat the lawful and pure foods which We have bestowed upon you, and be grateful to Allah if you sincerely worship Him.

Adopted from: Surah al-Baqarah, verse 172

The same term is soon used in various Quran and other translations such as in the Urdu translation of the Quran by Fateh Muhammad Jalandhry, where the term is used as اہل ایمان, in the following example below: 

اے اہل ایمان جو پاکیزہ چیزہں ہم نے تم کو عطا فرمائے ہیں ان کو کھاؤ اور اگر خدا بی کے بندے ہو تو اس (کی نعمتوں) کا شکر بھی ادا کرو

Source: Quran, Surah al-Baqarah, verse 172

Covfefe

Covfefe is a word that was spelt wrong by then-President of the US Donald Trump in a viral internet meme. It was sent in a tweet that said "Despite the constant negative press covfefe". It was widely suggested by the media that Donald Trump meant to write "coverage". However, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that it was not a misspelling, with him saying "I think the president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant."

The tweet would remain used in internet culture and by the media for much time afterwards. When writing for "The Atlantic", journalist Adrienne LaFrance said that "Covfefe remains the tweet that best illustrates Trump's most preternatural gift: He knows how to captivate people, how to command, and divert the attention of the masses." This media story suggested that Donald Trump was very good at getting attention and fascinate people.

The Urban Dictionary would soon add a page on "covfefe", with the page saying that: "It literally means covfefe."

Dictionary.com would also say that "covfefe" was at the top of their list of 'unmatched queries' in October 2017 and would continue to have the largest amount of user searches for words without a page.

U.S. Representative Mike Quigley started H.R.2884, "The Communications Over Various Feeds Electronically for Engagement Act (COVFEFE Act)" on June 12, 2017.

The bill went to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on the same day but saw no further congressional action. Despite this, Donald Trump's tweets and other posts were stored as said in the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014.

Chothe Thangwai Pakhangba

Chothe Thangwai Pakhangba is a Meitei language literary work of the first half of the eighteenth century AD. It is one of the rarest instances of the conjugal love set in the region of Ancient Moirang kingdom. The first page of the text mentions that the book was written during the period of King Garib Niwaj (Pamheiba) of Medieval Manipur. The story reflects the then society of Ancient Moirang. It is, in a sense, the reverse of the Nongban Pombi Luwaoba (Nungpan Ponpi Luwaopa).

Thangwai Koting Ahanpa (Thangwai Koding Ahanba) (337 AD-387 AD) was the ruler of Ancient Moirang and Leima Thamoilembi (Thamoilengpi), his queen. For sometime, the latter felt quite happy as she was with child, but suffered a shock as it disappeared through a natural abortion. However, Salailen (Soraren), the God of Heaven, sent the child back to her womb with the instruction that he should be born to the Queen as her son, but should not live long with her to attain the age of any rite of passage. Five months went by. Salailen (Soraren) appeared in her dream and told her that the child she was carrying was His own and that when born he should not be brought up on any propane food or drink. After she was delivered of the child, the God again appeared in her dream, reminded her of His relation with the child and expressed His desire to call him "Chothe Thangwai Pakhangba". Then the boy grew up and soon attained the grace and vigor of a youth. As human memory, by nature, is short, his parents had completely forgotten the divine dictates. Meanwhile, Chothe Thangwai Pakhangba, one day, chanced to see Sunulembi, the daughter of Thongnang Loikemba (of Cachari origin) and was instantly head over heels in love with her. Through a formal engagement, the two were married in a grand manner. But God's will is irrevocable and the young man had overstepped what was set for him. So, Salailen came in person and reminded during his sleep of what was enjoined on his parents. While awake, Sunulembi, his lady found him in tears enquired whether he had any secret love. At last, he came out with what to take place within five days and the same was conveyed in the early morning to his parents, friends and relatives. On the appointed day, Chothe Thangwai Pakhangba, prinked up in his best clothes with the help of his wife, and was now prepared for the heavenly journey. But Sunulembi, his lady too offered herself to keep her husband company to the land of the leal. None could restrain her and leaving all the near and dear ones thrown into an abyss of sorrow, the young couple ascended towards the sky, the progress of which was being watched by all on the ground with bated breath and by shading the eyes with their palms.

Soon afterwards, they were on the threshold of another sphere which was under deep waters of flood. The gate of heaven was thrown open and the guard posted there instantly prepared a bridge to which only the husband was granted entry. But on the earnest insistence of Sunulembi, both were allowed to cross. They went up to another hemisphere where their passage was blocked by a swarm of snakes. This time, on the request of her husband to the poisonous creatures, Sunulembi was allowed to proceed. On reaching the precincts of Salailen's abode, they were forbidden access as no couple could lead a worldly life in heaven. At last, the all-powerful God directed Sunulembi to return to earth and feed the man only with heavily victuals. But Sunulembi resisted it with all her might and with eyes bathed with tears, kept her husband tightly held in her arms. She also threatened of ending her life there from thirst and starvation. Hearing this, Salailen was flummoxed and immediately sent a ferocious wild boar as big as a bull to cause harm to the bewailing woman. But Sunulembi was the least awed by it and unflinchingly was ready to die the painful death. Next, a dreadful tiger was sent on her which too could not terrify her. Thirdly, she could easily withstand the surging waves of a devastating flood. Fourthly, the scorching flames of a wild fire left her untouched. Lastly, the god engaged a hill kite to snatch her away, which too miserably failed.

At long last, being moved her irrepressible spirit and devoted love, the God gave her husband back and over and above that the sceptre of the kingdom of Ancient Moirang was bestowed on Chothe Thangwai Pakhangba with a blessing of long and plentiful reign with his wife. As they descended straight alive and with radiant joy from heaven in broad daylight, the people of the kingdom were taken by surprise. But they were overjoyed at seeing the couple and instantly made Chothe Thangwai Pakhangba (387 AD-447 AD) the king.

Presently, Chothe Thangwai Pakhangba is also venerated as a serpentine dragon deity in Meitei mythology and religion.

World religions

World religions is a category used in the study of religion for the largest and most widespread religious movements. Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism are always included in the list; they are known as the "Big Five". Some scholars also include other religions, such as Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, or the Bahá'í Faith. The term "world religions" is used to compare them with other groups, such as indigenous religions and new religious movements.

The term was first used in the 1960s. Scholars such as Ninian Smart first used it, because he wanted to get away from looking at religions form a focus of Christianity. Smart also wanted to take other religious traditions into account. 

The concept of "world religion" has also been criticized: Scholars such as Jonathan Z. Smith have said that it should be abandoned. They say, the concept is bad because it takes the Protestant view as the model of what is a religion. Protestantism is a movement that developed recently. According to the scholars, it takes an uncritical standpoint, and it dictates what religions should be called "major". Other people have argued that the concept is useful, as long as people are aware of its shortcomings.

The scholars of religion Christopher R. Cotter and David G. Robertson described the "World Religions Paradigm" as a way of thinking about religions which organizes them into a set of discrete traditions with a supposedly 'global' importance. It typically consists of the "Big Five" religions: Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism.

As noted by Cotter and Robertson, the "Big Five" religions are often listed in an order which places the largest three Abrahamic religions—Christianity, Judaism, and Islam—before the non-Abrahamic religions Hinduism and Buddhism. The category is sometimes also extended to include other religious groups, such as Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, and the Baháʼí Faith.

Including Judaism in the Big Five is problematic: Because it influenced Christianity and Islam it is often included. It is also historically important. Looking at the number of its followers, however, it does not fit in the list: There are far fewer Jews than there are Christians, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists. It does also not fit the list, because the other groups want to spread their religion; Judaism doesn't.

Many scholars have used the "World Religions" category alongside other "catch-all" categories such as "new religious movements" and "indigenous religions". The scholar of religion Steven J. Sutcliffe compared the relationship between the three categories to the English football league system, with the "world" religions forming a Premier League, the "new" religions forming a Championship, and "indigenous" religions a First Division. That groups that get placed in categories like "indigenous religions" get treated less seriously than the "world religions" by many scholars was noted by the scholar of religion Graham Harvey. Harway said that "indigenous religions should receive similarly respectful treatment to that considered appropriate to the larger 'World Religions'."

Poly-Play

Poly-Play is an East German arcade machine by VEB Polytechnik that came out in 1985. It is the only arcade machine from East Germany. It contains multiple games. One of them is a "Pac-Man" clone. About 2,000 machines were made.


The machine's coin slot works by detecting pressure. It uses 50 Pfennig, but can be tricked by pressing a 1 Pfennig coin the correct way into the top of the slot. This was mostly allowed because the government owned the machines, which were mostly found in FDGB holiday homes, youth hostels and non-profit clubs. The machine could be played for free at many youth clubs until large crowds often came around them.

A machine was shown in the Museum of Computing in Swindon, England in 2004 before being shown as part of the touring video game show Game On from 2005 in multiple museums, such as the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago and the Science Museum in London. Two machines are at RetroGames e.V. in Germany, and another at the Computerspielemuseum Berlin.

All games have been able to be played in MAME since 2000. The names of four more games are in the source code: "Der Gärtner" (The Gardener), "Im Gewächshaus" (In the Greenhouse), "Hagelnde Wolken" (Hailing Clouds, a "Space Invaders" clone) and "Der Taucher" (The Diver, a game where malicious fish attack a diver). As well as those four games, 'Im Irrgarten" (In the Maze), "Der Lindwurm" (The Lindworm), "Fly" and "AFU" are on at least some machines. Another game, "UFO", is the original version of "Hagelnde Wolken", but was edited because the authorities did not like its fighting themes.

Seona Dancing

Seona Dancing (, ) was a British new wave band from the 1970s. The band is best known for making Ricky Gervais perform in public for the first time. The band had little success, except their song "More to Lose" become popular in the Philippines.

Ricky Gervais and his friend Bill Macrae started "Seona Dancing" while learning at University College London. Gervais wrote and sung the lyrics, and Macrae made the music and played keyboards. They recorded a demo tape with 16 songs, then were signed to London Records, which released two of their songs: "More to Lose" and "Bitter Heart". In June 1978, they performed "More to Lose" on the children's television show "Razzmatazz", which was shown on ITV. Despite that, and "Bitter Heart"'s promotion with a music video, "More to Lose" reached number 117 and "Bitter Heart" number 79, not reaching the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. This made the band end in 1979. Gervais later became successful around the world as a comedian and actor. When Jimmy Kimmel asked him about Macrae in an interview in 2014, he answered "I hope he got fat, too."
In 1980, DWRT-FM (then known as 99.5 RT, now 99.5 Play FM), a radio station in Metro Manila, Philippines, started playing a song, which they chose to give the false name of "Fade" by Medium (or "Medium" by Fade) to stop anyone finding and playing it. They also tried to stop other radio stations from recording and playing it by adding a station ID in the middle of the song. 1 year later, another radio station, DWXB-102, revealed the song is actually "More to Lose" by Seona Dancing.

The song, which uses repeating piano sounds to represent falling teardrops, has been popular on the radio, in clubs and at high-school dances from the 1980s. AllMusic critic Michael Sutton wrote that the track was "the theme song of angst-ridden New Wave youths in the Philippines" and "an '80s anthem as ubiquitous as Peter Gabriel's 'In Your Eyes', but with the eternal hipster cool of Joy Division's 'Love Will Tear Us Apart'."


An unofficial CD with all of the band's songs (except the 7" versions of "Bitter Heart" and "Tell Her") on it, named "More to Lose", came out in 2005.

This article collects the national teams world champions FIFA. The two competitions that award said official"" title was the two Olympic Tournaments of 1924 and 1928 (organised by the IOC together FIFA) and the current FIFA World Cup (from 1930).

Uruguay in the international plane has attained two World Cup (the first edition of 1930 and the edition of 1950) and has won two Gold Medals in the Olympic Games (in 1924 and 1928), the two only editions recognised by FIFA like championships of the world (until 2021, when the recognition was placed sub iudice). The decision took in 1924.

Although the FIFA does not promote the statistical unification of the tournaments, the legitimacy of the titles also was coming confirmed by the fact that the world-wide federation allowed to the National football team of Uruguay to show 4 stars in the T-shirt (also in the 2018 FIFA World Cup, unlike other teams that are used to plant the stars to evoke continental triumphs, as traditionally they do the African selections). According to the regulation of the FIFA, each star is equivalent to a world-wide conquered. 

Another confirmation was coming from of a book published by the FIFA and that contains a section that certifies, with vintage official documents, the position of Uruguay like four times "World Champion of the FIFA". 

In 2021, FIFA asked the Uruguayan federation to remove 2 stars from the game uniform. This was confirmed by the director of competitions and member of the Executive Council of the Uruguayan Football Association, Jorge Casales. Casales stated that the AUF will try to appeal the decision, showing that the two championships Olympics of 1924 and 1928, were recognized as world championships. The media wrote that the decision would be made by the FIFA Council as in the case of the Intercontinental Cup. In October, FIFA definitively recognized the world titles in question as official.

The Run of the Country

The Run of the Country is a 1995 American romantic drama movie directed by Peter Yates. It is based on the novel by Shane Connaughton, and stars Albert Finney and Matt Keeslar.

The story tells of a political and generational conflict in a teen romance and coming-of-age story in Ireland. Albert Finney stars as a policeman with the Garda Síochána in a small County Cavan village just south of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The sergeant, with nothing to do, hopes for just one murder to solve and make himself famous. His real concern, however, is that his relationship with his 18-year-old son Danny (Matt Keeslar) has been strained since the recent death of his wife from a heart attack during a domestic quarrel. Danny blames his father for his mother's death and resents his father's bullying ways, so he moves in with his best friend Prunty (Anthony Brophy). Danny then falls in love with Annagh (Victoria Smurfit), a beautiful, red-haired northerner, and their relationship, which becomes sexual, brings Danny's conflict with his headstrong father to a boil.


Novelist Shane Connaughton, who also wrote the script for "My Left Foot" (1989) and "The Playboys" (1992), adapted the script from his novel. The movie shares some of the same thematic and stylistic qualities of Yates's second movie of 1995 — "Roommates".

The movie was mainly filmed on location in Redhills and near Ballyhaise, neighbouring villages in County Cavan. Some scenes were filmed in Clones, County Monaghan, a town near Redhills. Other locations in the Republic of Ireland were also used.

Michael Wilmington of the "Chicago Tribune" said, "Peter Yates' best or best-remembered movies...all excel at showing male interaction. And that's one of the strong points of "Run of the Country." Just as Finney's outstanding trait as an actor is the solidity he gives his parts—his growly voice and bulldog chin pulling the audience one way, his yearning eyes pulling them another—Yates's direction, at its best, has an earthy reliability."

Speedy Gonzales

Speedy Gonzales is a cartoon character from "Looney Tunes". He is the fasted mouse in Mexico. He speaks with a Mexican accent.

Sanitary sewer

Modern sewer systems often separate rainwater from polluted water. "Wastewater" (polluted water, also called sewage) is treated before it is released into a river or lake again. This treatment may not be needed for rainwater (also called stormwater). This idea of using separate sewer systems for wastewater and rainwater is called sanitary sewer.

A sanitary sewer or foul sewer is an underground pipe or tunnel system for transporting sewage from houses and commercial buildings to treatment facilities. Sewage is treated to control water pollution before discharge to surface waters. 

Cholera is a deadly disease caused by foul water. The system of treating foul water was first invented in London. There cholera had repeatedly caused disease, but in the middle of the 19th century the first successful water treatment plants were invented.

Italian hip hop

80s

Italian hip hop started in the 1980s. One of the first hip hop crews to catch the attention of the Italian mainstream was Isola Posse All Star from Bologna.

In the early '80s, hip hop spread to Italy through social centers, where left-wing young people regularly met. Jovanotti was one of the first stars to emerge from this hip hop scene. He rapped in otherwise standard Italian pop music.

In the underground, Radical Stuff published the first Italian hip hop street video called “Let’s Get Dizzy” in 1989. Around the same time, Assalti Frontali, an underground hip hop group, was founded in Rome. They are known for their left-wing politically and socially charged lyrics.

90s

Articolo 31, a duo consisting of J-Ax and DJ Jad, emerged during the mid-'90s with their album “Strade di città”. Their fusion of rap, funk, and rock elements contributed significantly to the genre’s growth.

The 2000s marked a shift from the vibrant '90s rap scene in Italy. Artists like Articolo 31, Sottotono, Frankie hi-nrg, and Neffa had achieved significant success in the previous decade. Primo Brown, Fabri Fibra, and the rap group Colle Der Fomento contributed to the growing Italian rap community. Joe Cassano, El Presidente, Fritz da Cat, Turi, DJ Double S, Mondo Marcio also left their mark.

2000s

Between 2006 and 2008, Italian hip hop expanded its reach to a broader audience Mondo Marcio’s album “Solo un Uomo” brought the genre into the mainstream, followed by Fabri Fibra’s “Tradimento” and Marracash’s “Marracash”, both chart-toppers.

2010s

At the start of the 2010s, Italian pop music dominated charts, while hip hop artists like Club Dogo, Fabri Fibra, and Noyz Narcos were gearing up to release significant albums such as “Che Bello Essere Noi”, “Controcultura”, and “Guilty”.

Emerging artists like Emis Killa and MadMan made their presence felt with projects like “Champagne e Spine” and “Escape From Hearth”.

Around 2015-2016, Italian hip hop experienced a significant shift. Artists like Gemitaiz and MadMan, Salmo, Marracash and Charlie Charles with their albums characterized this period. 

Ghali officially debuted in 2017 with “Album”, entering the top-selling charts in Italy. His success paved the way for the new school, led by artists like Sfera Ebbasta, Izi, Capo Plaza, and Ernia.

Italian dialects vary significantly across regions. Artists from different areas embraced their local languages.

Campanians like Co’Sang, Clementino, Rocco Hunt, Geolier and Luchè incorporated their native Neapolitan dialects. Artists such as Dr. Drer & CRC Posse and Menhir, sing in Sardinian. Piotta and Truceclan often incorporate the Roman dialect into their songs. Sud Sound System combine Jamaican rhythms with the Salento dialect. Dj Tubet often raps in Friulian.

Flora and fauna of Mexico

Plant and animal life differs sharply with Mexico's varied climate and topography. The coastal plains are covered with a tropical rain forest, which merges into subtropical and temperate growth as the plateau is ascended. In the northern states there is a dry steppe vegetation, with desert flora over much of the area. Oaks and conifers are found in mixed forest regions along the mountain slopes. The Yucatán Peninsula has a scrubby vegetation.

Among the wild animals are the armadillo, tapir, opossum, puma, jaguar, bear, and several species of monkey, deer, and boar. Poisonous snakes and harmful insects are found. In the coastal marshes, malarial mosquitoes pose a problem. The only remaining elephant seals in the world are on Guadalupe Island west of Baja California.

Afro-Italians

Afro-Italians are people who are from the country of Italy and who have ancestors who are African.

From 1850 to 1880, more than 1,500 African babies were brought to Italy by “The Slave Masters of God,” a religious group that believed it was their duty to buy slaves and educate them in Italy. A century later, between 1980 and 1990, two million Africans immigrated to Italy.

Indian food

Indian food is the cuisine of India.

Cuisine of California

The cuisine of California reflects the diverse culture of California and is influenced largely by Hispanic American roots (Mexican, Latin American, Spanish), alongside East Asian and Oceanian influences (Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Filipino, Vietnamese, Thai, Hawaiian), and Western European influences (Italian, French, Portuguese), as well as the food trends and traditions of larger American cuisine.

The main trends were influenced by a combination of Mediterranean climate, geography and geology of the region's proximity to the ocean, its movie roots in Hollywood, its technology roots in Silicon Valley and the Napa wine country, as well as its major produce production. California used to be part of Mexico which influenced the state's food.

Joseph Bazalgette

Sir Joseph William Bazalgette, CB (; 28 March 181915 March 1891) was a 19th-century English civil engineer. He invented the system for cleaning drinking water so as to eliminate cholera.

As chief engineer of London's Metropolitan Board of Works his work was in response to the Great Stink of 1858. He invented the system for cleaning sewage which is basically the same as used today. It stopped the city from having cholera epidemics, and also reduced typhus and typhoid. Until then, cholera had been endemic in all large cities throughout the world, beginning in Roman times. 

Bazalgette's plan was for new, closed sewers to pump the waste away from the city. Bazalgette took the polluted water though sewage treatment plants, after which the clean water was returned to the Thames. 

Victorian London became one of the few large cities in the world to be free of epidemics carried by the water supply. The British later built the water and sewage systems in many other countries, especially those in, or connected with, the British Empire (Cairo, Khartoum, New Delhi and so on). The growth in population has made the water unsafe again in many places, but round about 1900 a clean water supply was available in many parts of the world. All this was a consequence of Snow's work, and Bazalgette's engineering.

Cholera has returned in modern times. Cities have outgrown the sewage systems built in the late 19th century. Governments have spent money on armaments rather than engineering. Uncontrolled population growth has meant the return of cholera to a world where it was once eliminated.

Bazalgette was also the designer of the Hammersmith Bridge.

Keibu Keioiba

Keibu Keioiba or Kabui Keioiba is a mythical creature in the Meitei mythology and folk stories of Manipur. He has the head of a tiger and the body of a human. Legends say he is half man and half tiger. 

Legend says he was once a skilful priest named Kabui Salang Maiba. He used magic to change into a strong and scary tiger. But because he was too proud, he could not change back all the way.

Keibu Keioiba was human in daytime and tiger during nighttime. During night, he walked around looking for food in his tiger form. One night, he came to an old woman's house. He wanted to eat her. The old woman said that her wrinkled skin would taste bad. She told him to eat a young, beautiful lady named ""Thabaton"" instead. Thabaton was the only sister in a family with seven brothers. The old woman told Keibu Keioiba that Thabaton's seven brothers were not at home. The brothers had gone away to work for a very long time. The old woman told Keibu Keioiba more tricks so he could catch Thabaton. For example, she told him how to trick Thabaton so she would open the door of her house. Keibu Keioba took Thabaton away from her house. Then the seven brothers came home from their work. They found Thabaton was not in the house. They asked the old woman about their sister. She told them that Keibu Keioiba had taken her away. The seven brothers prepared their weapons. They searched for their sister. Keibu Keioiba did not eat Thabaton. Instead, he made Thabaton his wife. They lived together in the woods. The seven brothers never stopped searching for their sister in the woods. One day, they saw Thabaton. When they came close to her, they saw a man and a child with her. The brothers secretly told Thabaton they were there. When Keibu Keioiba went away to hunt, Thabaton met her brothers. They planned to escape from that place. When Keibu Keioiba returned, Thabaton gave him an utong (bamboo pipe). The utong was hollow on both sides. She told Keibu Keioiba to get some water from the stream with that Utong. Keibu Keioiba went out to get water with the hollow utong. In Keibu Keioiba's absence, the seven brothers burned Keibu Keioiba's house and killed the baby. They ran away with their sister. Keibu Keioiba could not make the water stay in the utong. It leaked out. A crow was watching him from a treetop. The crow said, "Keibu Keioiba Naning Namang Hotrong Ho, Natu Leima Kangkok." The crow was telling Keibu Keioiba he was doing something foolish and his prisoner-wife had escaped. The crow crowed it many times. Keibu Keioiba finally noticed the crow's strange statement. He quickly returned home. When he reached home, he found it burned house, his son dead and his wife missing. He was very, very angry. He ran towards the house where had had caught Thabaton. The seven brothers knew Keibu Keioiba would come back. They were all ready with their weapons. As soon as Keibu Keioiba came towards them, they fought Keibu Keioiba. Finally, Keibu Keioiba died at the hands of the seven brothers. After the death of Keibu Keioiba, Thabaton and her seven brothers lived happily ever after.

"Keibu Keioiba (Tiger Head)", a 2009 Meitei language animation movie, was produced. It features the folk story of Keibu Keioiba.

"Yamata Amasung Keibu Keioiba" () is a Meitei language play that interweaves the stories of the two legendary creatures, Yamata-no-Orochi of Japanese mythology and Keibu Keioiba of Meitei mythology (Manipuri mythology). The role of Keibu Keioiba was firstly played by "Kshetrimayum Priyobrata" and then secondly played by "Pangambam Tyson Meitei".

Variants of SARS-CoV-2

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has a lot of variants. Some of them are important because of increased transmission and vaccines being less effective on them. This article discusses relevant variants of SARS-CoV-2 and mutations in these variants.

BA.2.86, or Pirola, is a variant. It has been known to media since August 2023. Research has not shown (as of 2023's third quarter) if this variant can possibly be more dangerous than other variants that are in circulation (or spreading infection from some people to more people). The variant has been found in Asia, Africa, North America, Europe, and the Middle East. It has "dozens of genetic changes". Related page: mutation.

There are a lot of lineages of SARS-CoV-2. Lineages are variants that are genetically the same.



Other variants that seem to be out of circulation:

There are different systems for giving names to variants.

Viruses generally mutate over time, creating new variants. When a new variant grows in a population, it's labeled as an "emerging variant".

Some of the potential consequences of emerging variants are the following:


This variant was first detected in October 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom from a sample taken the month before in Kent. Lineage B.1.1.7, It's correlated with a big increase in COVID-19 infection in United Kingdom, partly because of the N501Y mutation. There is some evidence that this variant has 40%–80% increased transmissibility and an increase in deadliness.

In December 2020, it became "Variant of Concern 20DEC-01".

Sometimes (in 2021) it has been called the "UK variant".
Variant of Concern 21FEB-02 (previously written as VOC-202102/02), described by Public Health England (PHE) as "B.1.1.7 with E484K" is the B.1.1.7 variant with an additional E484K mutation. As of 17 March 2021, there are 39 confirmed cases of VOC-21FEB-02 in the UK. On 4 March 2021, scientists reported B.1.1.7 with E484K mutations in the state of Oregon. It seems that this combination happened randomly in Oregon, instead of coming from the UK.

On 18 December 2020, the 501.V2 variant, also known as 501.V2, 20H/501Y.V2 (formerly 20C/501Y.V2), VOC-20DEC-02 (formerly VOC-202012/02), or lineage B.1.351, was first detected in South Africa and reported by the country's health department. Researchers and officials reported that the variant is more likely to make young people very sick. The South African health department also said that the variant may be driving the second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in the country.

Scientists said that the variant has many mutations that allow it to attach more easily to human cells because of the following three mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike glycoprotein of the virus: N501Y, K417N, and E484K.

Lineage P.1, termed Variant of Concern 21JAN-02 (formerly VOC-202101/02) by Public Health England and 20J/501Y.V3 by Nextstrain, was found in Tokyo on 6 January 2021 by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID). The new lineage was first identified in four people who arrived in Tokyo having travelled from the Brazilian Amazonas state on 2 January 2021. On 12 January 2021, the Brazil-UK CADDE Centre confirmed 13 local cases of the P.1 new lineage in the Amazon rain forest. This variant of SARS-CoV-2 has been named P.1 lineage (although it is a descendant of B.1.1.28, the name B.1.1.28.1 is not permitted and thus the resultant name is P.1), and has 17 unique amino acid changes, 10 of which in its spike protein, including the three concerning mutations: N501Y, E484K and K417T.

A study of samples from Manaus between November 2020 and January 2021, showed the P.1 lineage to be 1.4–2.2 times more transmissible. The variant is also 10–80% more deadly.

A vaccinated person has a higher risk of getting a mild P.1 infection while still being 100% protected against hospitalisation or death.

Preliminary data from two studies indicate that the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine is effective against the P.1 variant, although the exact level of efficacy has not yet been released. Preliminary data from a study conducted by Instituto Butantan suggest that CoronaVac is effective against the P.1 variant as well, and the study will be expanded to obtain definitive data.

Lineage B.1.429, also known as CAL.20C, has by five distinct mutations (I4205V and D1183Y in the ORF1ab-gene, and S13I, W152C, L452R in the spike proteins S-gene). B.1.429 might be more transmissible. The CDC has listed B.1.429 and the related B.1.427 as "variants of concern," and says that they have a ~20% increase in transmissibility.

B.1.429 was first discovered in July 2020 by researchers at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, California, in one of 1,230 virus samples collected in Los Angeles County since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic. It wasn't detected again until September when it reappeared among samples in California, but numbers remained very low until November. In November 2020, the CAL.20C variant accounted for 36 percent of samples collected at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and by January 2021, the CAL.20C variant was 50 percent of samples.

B.1.525, also called VUI-21FEB-03 (previously VUI-202102/03) by Public Health England (PHE) and formerly known as UK1188, doesn't have the same N501Y mutation found in B.1.1.7, 501.V2 and P.1, but has the same E484K-mutation as found in the P.1, P.2, and 501.V2 variants. B.1.525 is different from all other variants by having both the E484K-mutation and a new F888L mutation. As of March 5, it had been found in 23 countries, including the UK, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Nigeria, Ghana, Jordan, Japan, Singapore, Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Slovenia, Austria, Malaysia, Switzerland, the Republic of Ireland and the US.




The British government has reported recombinant variants of SARS-CoV-2. (Recombination happens when a virus combines parts from a related virus with the genetic sequence (of the first-mentioned virus) as it assembles (or gives) copies of itself.)

These recombinant lineages have been given the Pango lineage identifiers XD, XE, and XF.

XE is a recombinant lineage of Pango lineages BA.1 and BA.2.


There is a risk that COVID-19 could transfer from humans to other animal populations and could combine with other animal viruses to create (more) variants that are dangerous to humans. Reverse zoonosis can possibly happen.

In early November 2020, Cluster 5, also referred to as ΔFVI-spike by the Danish State Serum Institute (SSI), was discovered in Northern Jutland, Denmark, and is believed to have been spread from minks to humans via mink farms. On 4 November 2020, it was announced that the mink population in Denmark would be culled to prevent the possible spread of this mutation and reduce the risk of new mutations happening. A lockdown and travel restrictions were introduced in seven municipalities of Northern Jutland to prevent the mutation from spreading, which could compromise national or international responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. By 5 November 2020, some 214 mink-related human cases had been detected.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that cluster 5 has a "moderately decreased sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies". SSI warned that the mutation could reduce the effect of COVID-19 vaccines under development, although it was unlikely to render them useless. Following the lockdown and mass-testing, SSI announced on 19 November 2020 that cluster 5 in all probability had become extinct. As of 1 February 2021, authors to a peer-reviewed paper, all of whom were from the SSI, assessed that cluster 5 was not in circulation in the human population.

Choking game

The choking game is a challenge that aims to cause unconsciousness by lowering the supply of oxygen to the brain. When becoming conscious again ("waking up"), people often have a euphoric feeling, or a good dream. Most of the time, adolescents try this game. One of the reasons is that they want to experiment with other states of consciousness. If they do it as a group, peer pressure often plays a role. The practice seems to have started in France, in the early 20th century. After the second world war (late 1940s, to early 1950s), several authors described it.

The reasons to play this game are different from those of erotic asphyxiation. Steve Field, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners in London, claims that children and teens try the game mainly "to get a high without taking drugs." Children "aren't playing this game for sexual gratification." It is frequently confused with erotic asphyxiation, which is oxygen deprivation for sexual arousal. Unlike erotic asphyxiation, adults usually don't play this game. 

The brain will take permanent damage, if it doesn't get enough oxygen. The first effects occur within minutes. 

In the United States, and in France, where it is known as "jeu de foulard", this practice has caused several deaths. The CDC has identified 82 victims aged between 6 and 19 years, who died as a result of this practice, between 1995 and 2007.

Most of the sensations felt are:

According to Françoise Cochet, successfully preventing children from playing is to not only telling them that playing the game is dangerous, but also telling them about the risks involved.

The French government organised a conference on the subject, where experts from France and Belgium took part. Afterwards, a study was done, where 1012 children between 6 and 15 years of age, were questioned. The study found the following results:

Hongbao

Hóngbāo () or red envelope is an envelope with money inside. In China, people give the envelope as a gift for special occasions. The red envelopes are most commonly given to children or single/unmarried adults during the Chinese New Year celebration, where Chinese families often gather together.

The red packet is also called “money warding off old age” (压岁钱; "yāsuì qián") during Chinese New Year.

Outside of China, similar customs have been adopted or are traditional across parts of Southeast Asia and many other countries with a sizable ethnic Chinese population. In the mid-2010's, a digital equivalent to the practice emerged within messaging apps with mobile wallet systems.

According to Chinese legend, in ancient times there was a demon or evil fairy named "Suì" (祟). Legend says that Sui is totally black, except for its colorless, transparent hands. Sui—according to the said legend—appears every Chinese New Year’s eve and would touch a sleeping child’s head, causing mental illness.

This is why Chinese New Year celebration is practiced by staying up late during the new year’s eve, called "Shousui" or translated as “waiting for Sui”.

So, the elderly people started to thread coins with a red string, called "ya sui qian" or “money to suppress Sui”. The coins were given to children to entertain them, and to keep them awake to avoid "Sui"’s touch.

According to the same legend, eight noble fairies turned themselves into eight coins, protecting the children from "Sui." Thus, the story spread and everyone started to follow the same practice to protect the children. Over the years, the "ya sui qian" was replaced with the red envelopes—the "hongbao."

Postal Reorganization Act

The Postal Reorganization Act is an American law signed by President Richard Nixon in 1970. The law takes the Post Office Department out of the Cabinet of the President and makes it an independent agency. This agency is the United States Postal Service.

The Post Office had been struggling due to Congress. Because the department was a part of the government, Congress had to approve most things that happened to it. This made change to the Postal Office Department very slow, and this did not sit well with the Postal Unions. They wanted more change to improve the conditions of the Postal Workers, but Congress was too slow to bring in rapid change. The unions worked with Congress and the president to create a better system. The Postal Reorganization Act was the final product of this work.

One of the changes was the business goal of the Postal Service. Now that they were an independent agency, they did not receive money from Congress, so they had to work to make money through the selling of stamps and shipping.

Another was their new way of choosing the Postmaster General. A Board of Governors is elected by the president, and these people are able to choose the Postmaster General.

The Post Office Department also changed their name to the United States Postal Service, and this is the same Postal Service that is delivering mail today.

Markovnikov's Rule

Markovnikov's rule or Markownikoff's rule started that in addition to polar reagent to unsymmetrical alkene the negative part of the polar reagent (Cl, OH, F etc) is attached to the carbon having the lowest number of hydrogen while the positive part of the polar reagent (H,Na,Mg,Al etc) is attached to the carbon having the highest number of hydrogen. The rule was postulated by Vladimir Markovnikov.

From the above diagram, the reactant which is prop-1-ene which unsymmetrical alkene, it's reacting with Hydrobromic acid (Hydrogen Bromide) which is the polar reagent. When this hydrogen bromide dissociate it yield H+ and Br-. The positive part of this polar reagent (H+) is attached to the carbon in between the double bond with highest number of hydrogen while the negative part of this polar reagent (Br-) is attached to the carbon in between the double with the lowest number of hydrogen. It's usually go with addition reactant.

Anti-Markovnikov's rule oppose Markovnikov's rule completely. It occur in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). 

Anti-Markovnikov's rule started that in addition polar reagent to unsymmetrical alkene the positive part of the polar reagent is attached to the carbon in between the double with lowest number of hydrogen while the negative part of the polar reagent is attached to the carbon in between the double having the highest number of hydrogen.

A partition table maps out partitions onto a storage device. The two biggest examples are MBR and GPT. Others include Apple Partition Map (APM), which is used in Apple computers, and BSD disklabel.

MBR, or Master Boot Record, is a section at the very beginning of a storage device that uses MBR. It contains a partition table, along with storage for a bootloader so the computer can boot. It can only hold up to 2 tebibytes of data, and can only have up two four partitions.

GPT, or GUID Partition table, is a partition table that was developed as part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) standard. It can have up to 128 partitions. Depending on the size of the disk sectors, it can hold a large amount of data. If your sectors are 512 bytes, like MBR, it can hold 8 zebibytes of data.

Juventas

Juventas, also known as Iuventus or Juventus (Greek equivalent: Hebe), was an ancient Roman goddess. She represented youth and rejuvenation. She was mostly the goddess of young men "new to wearing the toga" "(dea novorum togatorum)" or, men who had just come of age.

Many associations "(collegia)" were made for Juventas in the Italian municipalities. They are known because of inscriptions.

Juventas owned a shrine in the cella of Minerva on the Capitoline, that most likely was made at about 218 BC. At this time, she was compared with the Greek Hebe. Dionysius and Livy thought that she and the god Terminus "refused" to do the ceremony of reversal "(exauguratio)" when Tarquin desired to rebuild the temple district on the Capitoline. Even though other gods were moved, these two were part of the new structure. Dionysius also thought that the semi-legendary king Servius Tullius made a temple fund for Juventas, and each family had to contribute to it. The thought that she was a part of ancient Roman religion depends mainly on these two aetiological legends, as she is not seen in the early history of Roman festivals.

On the advice of the Sibylline books, which were read during anxieties about the Second Punic War, Juventas was part of sacrifices in 218 BC relating to a lectisternium, a public feast at which images of gods were displayed as if the gods were part of it. Like other deities whose cult was ordained by the Sibylline books, Juventas was called "ritu graeco", following "Greek" rite. Also at the lectisternium of 218 BC, a supplication was performed at the Temple of Hercules. In Greek myth, the divinized Hercules had Hebe as his wife. The cultivation of both deities at the time of the Second Punic War seems intended to reinvigorate men of fighting age: Juventas "was regarded as a powerful divine force rendering a vital gift of strength at a critical moment." This is also the first time the "Genius Publicus" ("Genius of the People") is written. After the disastrous Battle of Lake Trasimene in April 217 BC, Juventas, Hercules, and the Genius Publicus were excluded for a time from divine honors, as they were not thought to have been effective. Marcus Livius Salinator vowed a temple to her during the Battle of the Metaurus, when he faced Hasdrubal in 207 BC—an indication that Juventas was still felt to have power.

A procession "(supplicia canum)" in which Romans carried crucified dogs passed between the Temple of Juventas and that of Summanus. A late source dates the "punishment of the dogs" to August 3.

On Imperial coins, Juventas and Spes ("Hope") are often associated with the reigning Caesar. A prayer to Juventas and Spes marked the anniversary of Augustus's coming of age. Juventas was among the many "Virtutes" ("Virtues") to appear on the coinage of Antoninus Pius.


Homo naledi

Homo naledi is a species of archaic human found in the Rising Star Cave, Cradle of Humankind, South Africa. The species possibly lived in the Middle Pleistocene 335,000–236,000 years ago.

Poststructuralism

Post-structuralism is a kind of philosophy and way of looking at media. The ""Post-"" in Post-structuralism means "comes after." "Structuralism" is another kind of philosophy. Most of post-structuralism is about saying that structuralism is wrong.

The people we call Post-structuralists who wrote about structuralism all had different ideas. A common idea among them was not liking how some structuralists thought the whole world could be thought of as symbols that are opposite to each other. They thought that things in life and in media are more complex than that, so that thinking "this is the opposite of that" was silly. A lot of the time, the post-structuralists said that the things that we think of as the ends of a binary were really made up by other people, and were not really useful or true.

"Structuralism" says that we can see human culture as a structure that looks like language. It also says that this is not reality, but we can use a "third order" that makes a bridge between the two. A post-structuralist might say that to build meaning out of that, you have to make a mistake and think that the definitions of things are good and don't change. Post-structualists might also say that the structuralist theory is above and not a part of these structures they are writing things about.

Post-structuralist writers write about how structuralism is too stiff and is wrong to put things in categories.

Writers that have been called post-structuralists include: Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari, Judith Butler, Jean Baudrillard and Julia Kristeva, although some did not want to be called "post-structuralist."

Autoradio

Autoradio () (105.1 Minsk FM) was the first private radio station in Belarus. It worked from Minsk. The radio station used the frequency 105.1 MHz. It worked from August 7, 1992 to January 12, 2011. 

From the start of the 1990s to January 1, 1995, Autoradio was heard on the frequency 67.7 OIRT FM. Autoradio used OIRT FM (the International Radio and Television Organisation wave in the air). It was the only open range for people and organizations in Belarus at that time. In 1995, the radio station was cut. It took four years to get back on the air. In 2001, the second wave line was started on the FM frequency 105.1 MHz (Megahertz). 

Belarusian music was heard on the radio. Groups N.R.M., Krambambula, Lyapis Trubetskoy, Neuro Dubel, and the best songs from the Tuzin.fm website selection were heard the most. Famous people worked for the radio station, such as Oleg Khomenko, Dzmitryj Wajciuszkiewicz, and Masha Yar.

In September 2009, the Ministry of Information of the Republic of Belarus penciled a punishment for Autoradio for broadcasting the EuroZoom show made together with European Radio for Belarus.

At 12:40 on January 12, 2011, the Autoradio's broadcasting document was taken away and the radio station saw its end.

Both were against Alexander Lukashenko in the 2010 presidential elections in Belarus.

Journalist Paulyuk Bykouski said that the Autoradio's advertisements were in agreement with the Central Election Commission of Belarus (the organization that does elections). The court of the first level supported the position of Avtoradio. Its decision was changed later. As a result of the change, Dmitry Alexandrov, judge of the Economic Court of Belarus, who ruled to shut the radio station down, became a person whose EU accounts and moves to the European Union were iced.

The government-run radio station Stalitsa () was given the frequency 105.1 MHz that was taken away from Autoradio. Stalitsa began using it on April 15, 2012.

Yuri Bazan, the person who made Autoradio and was its main editor, died on September 24, 2016.

Music judge Dzmitry Padbiarezski called Autoradio one of his much loved Belarusian FM-stations.

In 2011, the group N.R.M. recorded the song "Autoradio" () in support of the shut down radio station.

Death and funeral of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh

Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth realms, and the longest-serving royal consort in British history, died at Windsor Castle at age 99 on the morning of 9 April 2021. The cause of death has not been released, though an official statement says he "died peacefully".

Named after the Forth Bridge in Edinburgh, the city of his dukedom, the national plan for publicly handling the Duke's death is called Operation Forth Bridge.

The Duke could have a full state funeral, but had wished for minimal "fuss"; as such, there was no state funeral or lying in state. He had a military funeral conducted at St George's Chapel.

Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, who resides in the United States, had planned to return to the UK for the Duke's 100th birthday. Instead, he returned for the funeral, which happened eight days following the Duke's death. No laws were passed in the eight-day mourning period for the Duke.

Changes were necessary against mass gatherings because of the COVID-19 pandemic; for example, there were no crowds or members of the public present at any time, with the number attending not more than thirty, in line with regulations.

The Duke was not given a state funeral, which are usually reserved for monarchs. Instead, he had a royal ceremonial funeral. He did not want to lie in state, though the Duke did "lie at rest" in the private chapel at Windsor Castle prior to his service. He had a military funeral conducted at St George's Chapel and burial in the same place.

This royal ceremonial funeral was the same level of honour as formerly given to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and Diana, Princess of Wales. His funeral was broadcasted on television.

Blue Sky Rangers

The Blue Sky Rangers is a group of Intellivision game programmers who worked for Mattel in the early 1980s.

When the Intellivision first came out in 1978, its games were made by APh Technological Consulting. When they knew they could get much more profit making them themselves, Mattel created their own software development group. The original five members of that Intellivision team were manager Gabriel Baum, and Don Daglow, Rick Levine, Mike Minkoff and John Sohl. Levine and Minkoff (Minkoff is a long-time Mattel Toys veteran) both came over from the hand-held Mattel games engineering team. To stop them and later programmers (the Mattel team peaked at 110 people in 1983) from being hired away by their rival Atari, their identity and work location was secret.

In 1982, "TV Guide" published an article about Intellivision's secret programming team. The writer of the article wanted a group name other than "The Application Software Programmers," so he thought of "The Blue Sky Rangers". This was based on the programming group's "Blue Sky Meetings," which were a series of sessions to make new game ideas.

One of the early programmers, Keith Robinson, has owned the rights to Intellivision in recent years and the Blue Sky Rangers' games are now available on multiple computer and video game platforms, as well as mobile phones. He died in June 2017. Intellivision Entertainment, which is owned by Tommy Tallarico, owns the rights to Intellivision, and is making a new console named Intellivision Amico.

The panels reduce transmission of sound. This is essential for preventing noise passing to nearby spaces. Together with active earmuffs, panels help keep the workplace or home noise from interfering with the kind of activities which require thought and attention.

Applications include hotel function rooms, schools, conference centres, religious and sports facilities, business companies and private homes. 

In private homes they can help with some tricky problems, such as a family outgrowing the home, but not able to move to larger premises.

Portable partitions are temporary walls used to divide rooms instead of permanent walls. They may be joined together section by section, or stand as one unit. Portable walls may be fixed, or on casters for rolling, while others may be folding room dividers.

In Japanese homes and buildings, sliding panels called "fusuma" are widely used.

Folding screens have been used in China for over two thousand years.

Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach

Alfried Felix Alwyn Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach (13 August 1907 – 30 July 1967), often referred to as Alfried Krupp, was part of the Krupp family. They had a steel-making business in 19th and 20th century Germany. The Krupp family is famous for taking advantage of war to make money and for enslaving workers during World War II. At one time, the Krupp company was the biggest maker of weapons in the world.

Krupp was born in 1907 in Essen, Germany. He joined the Nazi Schutzstaffel (SS) in 1933. The Krupp company pretended to make farm equipment but they were really making tanks. They moved and rebuilt factories. Some of the workers in the factories were enslaved people from concentration camps in the Holocaust. Historians say there were 100,000 slaved workers and as many as 70,000 of them died.

Historian Harold James says that Alfried Krupp only became leader of the company in 1943, after all the enslaving had happened, and that he was a scapegoat for the company's bad actions. Krupp was put on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg Trials. He was sentenced to 12 years, but he was pardoned in 1951.

Gauge (firearms)

The gauge (U.S. English) or bore (British English) is the inside width of the barrel of a firearm. 

So, a 12-bore shotgun could take a cartridge with a solid sphere of lead which fits a 12-guage bore. Actually, the gun fires a cartridge which looses off a cluster of small lead pellets. They in total weigh the same as the single lead sphere which just fits the barrel.

Lead is poisonous, and builds up in the environment. By 1919, the spent lead pellets from waterfowl hunting was identified as a major source of deaths of bottom-feeding waterfowl. So the tendency is to switch to steel pellets in the cartridge. Dense (heavy) plastic pellets in cartridges is another option, standard in competition shooting.

Deuterium–tritium fusion

Deuterium–tritium fusion is a type of nuclear fusion. In deuterium–tritium fusion, one deuterium nucleus, or the center of a deuterium atom, fuses with one tritium nucleus. This makes one helium nucleus, one neutron, and 17.6 mega electronvolts of energy.

Deuterium is easy to find in seawater. 1 in 5000 hydrogen atoms are deuterium. However, tritium is a radioactive isotope. If lithium is exposed to neutrons with much energy, tritium is produced. The deuterium–tritium reaction also produces one neutron. In fusion reactors, a 'breeding blanket' is used where the walls of the fusion reactor have lithium on them. This way, the neutrons produced from fusion will hit the lithium and produce more tritium.

Stereoisomerism

Stereoisomers are chemicals with the same atoms as each other but different shapes. Stereoisomers have the same molecular formula as each other but the atoms do not connect to each other in the same order. Stereoisomerism is also called "spatial isomerism." Stereoisomers are so unique because of spatial arrangements of atoms.

Enantiomers, are also called "optical isomers." Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are like mirror images of each other but can't be turned around or moved so that they are the same, the way a right hand and a left hand of the same person are mirror images of each other. Compounds that are enantiomers to each other have the same physical properties, except for the direction in which they rotate polarized light and how they interact with different optical isomers of other compounds. Pure enantiomers also have optical activity and can be separated only with the use of a chiral agent. An optically active compound shows two forms: -(+) form and -(−) form.

Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias

Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias were an English comedy rock band. They were formed in Manchester, England in 1973.

Their story is told in CP Lee's book "When We Were Thin" . The name of the band is a corruption of the Latin American band "Alberto y Los Trios Paraguayos".

Created in 1973 by Chris "C.P." Lee (vocals, guitar, bass), with Jimmy Hibbert (vocals, bass) and Bob Harding (vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards), the comedy sketch outfit became a musical group in 1974 and was joined by drummer Bruce Mitchell (drums), with Les Prior (vocals), Simon White (steel guitar, guitar) and Tony Bowers (vocals, bass, guitar). They became a popular support act, supporting Dr. Feelgood on their 1974 tour. The group mercilessly parodied the major rock names of the 1970s – "Anadin" was a sendup of Lou Reed's "Heroin". By 1975 they were topping the bill in their own right and were supported by such acts as The Police, The Stranglers, Devo, Ian Dury and the Blockheads, The Buzzcocks, Joy Division, The Cure, The Jam, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Robyn Hitchcock, Split Enz and Blondie. They were promoted by Noddy Holder and Freddie Mercury. As with many comedy ensembles, the Albertos belied their comic aspirations by their exemplary musicianship, and they released four albums and a variety of spoof discs, culminating in the musical play, "Snuff Rock".

"Sleak (aka Snuff Rock)", inspired by the then recent film, "Snuff", and the concept of snuff movies, but carrying the idea to a band who killed themselves for entertainment, was their musical play presented at London's Royal Court Theatre and Round House and was famous for the role of the comic disc jockey played by Les Prior. They reached the UK Singles Chart with the accompanying EP, "Snuff Rock", released on Stiff Records, poked fun at the punk rock phenomenon, targeting the Sex Pistols ("Gobbing On Life"), The Damned ("Kill") and The Clash ("Snuffin' Like That") as well as myriad reggae bands in "Snuffin' In A Babylon". Tony Bowers and Bob Harding left the band on 29 July 1978, and they were replaced by John Scott (vocals, bass, guitar, saxophone, keyboards) (ex John Cooper Clarke and Jilted John) and Ged Green (vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards) in August 24, 1978. They reached the UK Singles Chart with the Status Quo spoof, "Heads Down No Nonsense Mindless Boogie" in 1978. Les Prior died in January 31, 1980 from leukaemia, which left a large gap in the group. Ged Green left the band in April 25, 1980, he was replaced by Ian Morris ("Mog") (vocals, bass) (ex The Smirks) in May 23, 1980.

After their nationally networked TV show "Teach Yourself Gibberish", their fourth and final album with "Radio Sweat" and crack at America with Sleak (they met with Oingo Boingo, Joan Jett and Pete Shelley in New York, who were saw their show, at the time), the Albertos disbanded in 1982.

The band's brand of spoof rock has been said to be in the same English tradition as that of the Barron Knights and the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, but a better comparison might be the American parody singer Weird Al Yankovic.

Turkish coffee

Turkish coffee is probably the original way of making coffee. It is a way of making coffee using ground coffee beans without filtering it. The way to make Turkish coffee is by pouring hot water into a pot containing ground coffee beans or coffee powder. Turkish coffee was popularized during the Ottoman Empire. Mocha, Yemen is a city that was used to ship most of the coffee beans, which originally came from Ethiopia. For this reason, Turkish coffee is sometimes called Mocca. 

Similar versions are also made in Czechia, Slovakia, Poland, Lithuania, Greece, Armenia and the Balkans.

Turkish coffee first appeared in the Ottoman Empire. The coffee was considered a drug and it was forbidden to drink it. But, because it was very popular the sultan eventually lifted this prohibition.

Turkish coffee had reached Britain and France by the 17th century. The first coffee house in Britain was opened by an Ottoman Jew in the mid 17th century.

To make Turkish coffee, ground coffee beans are used. The ground coffee beans is mixed with water and boiled. It is boiled in a special pot called "cezve" in Turkey. After it boils it is taken off the heat and served. The coffee is traditionally served in a small porcelain cup called a "kahve fincanı" 'coffee cup'. Sometimes sugar is added to the coffee to make it taste sweet.

Hiroshi Inuzuka

Hiroshi Inuzuka (born 23 March 1929 – 27 October 2023) was a Japanese actor and bass player. He is a member of Hajime Hana and The Crazy Cats. He was the last survivor of the group. The only member of Crazy Cats to have survived to the Reiwa era. His nickname was Wan-chan, which means "Mister Dog" in English. He also worked as a talent agent at the Sakai Office.

Inuzuka grew up in Ōmorimachi, Ebara-gun, Tokyo (now Omori, Ota-ku, Tokyo) in 1929. He was originally from a Hatamoto family who left from the Mikawa Province to Edo with Tokugawa Ieyasu They were landowners who lived in the area of the current main building of the Daiichi Hotel Tokyo for more than ten generations until his grandfather's generation.

His father, Noboru (1894-1983), was a merchant and worked extensively abroad, so Inuzuka became familiar with jazz and Hawaiian records, which developed an interest in music. After graduating from the Hyosung Junior High School and Army Flight School, he attended and graduated from the College of Social Sciences, Bunka Gakuin in 1949. After being introduced by an American exchange student who was friends with his father and was in the commercial business, Inuzuka joined IBM (International Business Machines Corporation), which was conducting a statistical survey of expeditionary forces at the time, but left the company two years after the presenter returned to Japan. He left the company because many American workers bullied him and called him names.

After leaving IBM, he joined the Hawaiian band Green Glass Cap Boys, created by his older brother in 1951. His brother told him to play the bass. Inuzuka took private lessons in the basics with the director of the Japan Philharmonic Orchestra. That is why it has become a variant of the bass jazz bow. In 1952, he joined Tetsuaki Hagiwara and Duke Octet at the invitation of Teruo Yoda of Six Lemons. He started playing modern jazz. However, Inuzuka felt something that was unfamiliar with the jazzy style of those days, and at the invitation of Hajime Hana, who used to come to the dressing room at the time, he began participating in the formation of "Hajime Hana and Cuban Cats",which became Crazy Cats on April 1, 1955.

His main instrument was the wooden double bass. After that, while appearing in television and movies as a member of the group, he also starred in Daiei as "The Fourth Man" along with Hitoshi Ueki, Hajime Hana, and Kei Tani. However, Inuzuka, who says, "Basically, I don't like antics," has appeared more often in non-comedies since 1970, and became engrossed in the theater when Jukichi Uno and Koichi Kimura taught him drama. Inuzuka then started thinking about transferring to Watanabe Productions, the multimedia management company. After the current office was approved in the 10th negotiation, he left production in 1986. At that time, the president of Watanabe Productions, Shin Watanabe, even said to Inuzuka the day before he left, "If you have difficulties, come back to the studio."

He was especially close to Kei Tani due to Shimodo's similarity. When the other members went out into town at night, the remaining two spent time making cards and story material. Even if they met for the first time in a long time, they could understand everything just by looking at each other. At the farewell party after his death, Inuzuka read the condolences. Even when Êtarô Ishibashi, who is also a first-grade senior at Hyosung Junior High School, left the group and headed for his cooking career, which he's really good at it, Inuzuka cheered him on by saying "Oy, it's a fish that It has water", and Shin Yasuda, the youngest member of the group, always said "with me" Mr. Ahn, " respectfully. Similarly, he praised Senri Sakurai saying, "When Bandman's average monthly salary was ¥40,000, Mr. Sakurai was ¥180,000, but no one ridiculed him." Regarding the death of Ueki in 2007, he commented: "It is too early to be 80 years old today." Even Kei Tani, whose memory has deteriorated, is behind the camera with his own dial, and Hajime Hana is angry that he was suddenly called his real name, Hirom, in the production of "Shabontama Holiday". In 1980, when Hajime Hana sent a bouquet to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the formation of Crazy Cats, he called Hajime Hana, saying, "Idiot Sadao, do something extra," and there was a story that they cried between them.

The silhouette of the man who plays the guitar from "Stardust" at the end of the show was Inuzuka himself. He also played variety characters like Jinbesu in ""Operation Crazy"", Hiroku in ""Baka ga tanku de yatte kuru"" and private detective Inumaru in ""Kureji no buchamukure daihakken"". In November 2012, Senri Sakurai died and Inuzuka became the last surviving member of the band.

Not only as a musician but also as an actor. Inuzuka was active even after the age that he is said to be a great veteran, but his wife died around 2015, and he himself turned 90 years old and suffered from spinal canal stenosis and other diseases. He announced his intention to retire as an actor at the end of the film "Labyrinth of Cinema" (directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi) scheduled to be released in 2020, saying that his body was stuck as he was affected by the disease. However, this is only a retirement as an actor, not as an artist or comedian. As of 2019, Inuzuka led a retired life in a condo for the elderly in Atami City, Shizuoka Prefecture.
Hiroshi Inuzuka died at the age of 94 on 27 October, 2023. With his death, all members of Crazy Cats have passed away.

Comedian (artwork)

Comedian is a work of art made by Maurizio Cattelan in 2019. It is made of a banana duct taped to a wall. Three editions of the art were made. Two of them were sold for $120,000.

Maurizio Cattelan is known for making strange art. His sculpture "America" is a working golden toilet. He has used duct tape before by taping a person on a wall for an art gallery. He bought the banana used in "Comedian" for about 30 cents. Emmanuel Perrotin was the exhibitor of "Comedian". He said it has many meanings and is a good way to show humor. It was the first time in more than 15 years that Cattelan's art was shown in an exhibition.

Some people did not think it should really be called art. "The Guardian" said it was a "questionably genius work". They said the price of the art reminded them of a joke in the sitcom "Arrested Development" about not knowing how much a banana costs. "Artnet News" said it was one of the worst works of art for the week. They thought that the price was foolish. "USA Today" made jokes about the art's price. "Newsweek" called it "humorous" and "minimalist" (art that uses simple ideas). CBS News said it was "the most talked-about" work of art at the gallery. "Comedian" was put on the cover of "The New York Post" for a day.

Three editions of the art were made. Two of them were bought at the art gallery Art Basel for $120,000. This got the attention of mass media. One of the editions was bought by Sara Andelman (a founder of a fashion shop). Another was bought by Billy and Beatrice Cox. They said that they knew some people thought it would be foolish to buy it. They bought it because they said it would be "" and "historical". It came with a certificate to show that it is the real art.

Artist David Datuna ate one of the editions at the Art Basel. He called his intervention "Hungry Artist". A new banana was used after that. No legal complaints were made, but Datuna was told to leave the gallery. He said that anything done to the art can be art itself. "I am a hungry artist, and I am hungry for new interactions."

Some people tried to think of what the art could mean, while others did not think it was serious. Artist Sebastian Errazuriz duct taped a dildo on a wall and tried to get $12,000 from it. CryptoGraffiti made jokes on trying to find bitcoin keys in bananas. Brooke Shields taped a banana on her forehead and put it on Instagram with the text "An expensive selfie". Design Simon Porte Jacquemus made an image of a bag he designed with tape on it. Many other companies made images of their products being taped.

"Comedian" was taken out of the art gallery on December 8, 2019. Curators did this because they thought people would harm other works of art at the gallery. They made an apology for those that wanted to see it. Emmanuel Perrotin made an account on social media about "Comedian" after that. One of the walls that had the art was vandalized with the text "Epstein didn't kill himself".

Hkakabo Razi

Hkakabo Razi is a mountain in Asia. It is in the Burmese Himalayas range of the Kachin State in northern Myanmar. This mountain is in 3 countries: Myanmar , India, and China. It is the highest mountain in Myanmar. It has been protected as a national park since 1998. The mountain is in Kachin State, the northernmost state of Myanmar.

Takashi Ozaki (Japan, 1951 – May 14, 2011) and Nyima Gyaltsen (aka "Aung Tse"; Myanmar) made the first ascent in 1996. As of 2021, they were the only people to have reached the top of the mountain and to have returned alive. Ozaki had attempted the mountain in 1995 but turned back due to bad weather. The route to basecamp is long (four weeks). A dense rain forest needs to be traversed, with many unbridged stream crossings. Before 1993, foreigners were not allowed travel to the area. This may be one of the reasons why the first successful climb was only done recently.

In 2013, the nearby peak of Gamlang Razi was climbed and measured at using an advanced version of GPS, making it possibly the highest in Myanmar. Ozaki had confirmed Hkakabo's height as 5881 m, but he did not yet have the GPS equipment to measure the exact height of Hkakabo Razi.

A team was sent out, to measure the exact height, in 2014. They had to turn back at a height of . They estimated that the summit was higher. Therefore, its exact height is unknown.

In the game, Makoto Naegi enters the school building before fainting and waking up in a classroom. While in the animation, Makoto steps foot onto the school and immediately falls unconscious. He then goes to the gym to meet fifteen other high school students who joined Hope's Peak Academy. After the introductions, a robotic bear named Monokuma introduces himself and states that they are trapped in the school. The only way to escape is to commit murder without getting caught by the other students. For the rest of the game/animation, Makoto and his classmates are to find the murderers. If they do not find the murderer they will be executed, if they do find the murderer, only the murderer will be executed.

Hajime Hinata and 15 other students join an academy. When Hajime enters the academy he walks into a room that is filled with binary code and a door. When he walks through the door, he enters a classroom filled with fifteen other students. They all introduce themselves. A robotic rabbit named Usami/Monomi/Magical Girl Usami appears and introduces herself as their teacher. After her introduction, she gets a magical wand and twirls it around, the ceiling and walls rip off to show a paradise beach. Afterwards on a beach, she asks them to earn 15 Friendship Fragments. Afterwards, Usami asks everyone to come back to the beach, but a random storm shows up and a silhouette of Monokuma appears on a monitor. The silhouette asks the students to meet at a place on the island named Central Park. Monokuma introduces himself on the statue in Central Park and begins the killing game. He tells them the only way to escape the island successfully is to kill another student without getting caught by the other students. For the rest of the game, Hajime and his classmates attempt to debunk the mysteries and catch the murderers.

Komaru Naegi and Toko Fukawa (from the first game) attempt to save the world from dangerous Monokuma robots. The events of this game take place between the second and first game, during the Despair event that seemed to kill off most of humanity. Komaru Naegi, Makoto Naegi's sister, has been trapped inside an apartment with no connection to the outside world for a year. Every day, she goes to the exit door but it seems to be locked from outside. However, one day, food was delivered to her and she banged on the door in an attempt to escape, as usual. A hostile Monokuma robot with sharp claws goes to attack her, chasing her across the locked apartment and the apartment building. She races to an elevator, which contains Byakuya Togami. He gives her a hacking gun, designed as a megaphone, and tells her to run to a nearby restaurant and find a member of the Future Foundation. Hostile Monokuma robots enter the restaurant and start attacking the customers, killing many of them. Afterwards, Komaru finds a Future Foundation member and they guide her to go to a helicopter. When she gets to the helicopter, she sees a kid wearing a Monokuma head singing. She gets onto the helicopter but a Monokuma robot tries to enter. After she solves this, another issue begins. A Monokuma robot was up front tinkering with the helicopter controls and drives them up into the sky. Her first failed execution begins, as she flies into the sky. The helicopter crashes, with Komaru surviving with minor damage to her body. A Monokuma robot appears in front of her, as more appear. She faints and wakes up in a room. The Ultimate Servant, Nagito Komaeda, enters the room and asks if she could come to the main room. When she enters, five children introduce themselves as the Lil' Ultimate's. They also introduce a new type of killing game named Demon Hunting where the Lil Ultimate's had a target hitlist. It was their objective to kill all adults and make it a kids only place. Komaru's second failed execution begins, as she falls down a hole with a parachute. Again, she survives with minor injuries. After this, she meets Toko Fukawa and her alternate self, Genocide Jill/Jack. For the rest of the game, they go on a mission to defeat the Lil' Ultimates together, and save the city from the evil Monokuma robots.

Mobile game

A mobile game is a video game designed to be played on mobile phones or tablets. The first game ever played on a mobile phone was a version of "Tetris", which was available on the Hagenuk MT-2000 device in 1994.

In 1997, Nokia introduced a game called "Snake". It was already installed on many Nokia mobile devices and has become one of the most popular games. The Nokia 6110 had a version of "Snake" that allowed two players to play using the infrared port, making it the first of many two-player games for mobile phones.

Nowadays, mobile games are typically downloaded from an app store. However, there are also instances where games come pre-installed on handheld devices by the manufacturer or mobile operator. This can be done through an infrared connection, Bluetooth, memory card, or by directly transferring the game to the device using a cable.

Fauna of Australia

The fauna of Australia is different from that of Asia. Some 83% of mammals, 89% of reptiles, 90% of fish and insects and 93% of amphibians that inhabit the continent are "endemic to Australia". 

The fauna is quite different from that of New Zealand, but is similar to that of New Guinea. That comes about because New Zealand is a volcanic oceanic island with no historical connection with Australia. Its animals have not come from Australia. On the other hand, New Guinea is an island on the same continental plate as Australia, and on the same side of the Wallace line. This was discovered by Alfred Russel Wallace, and explained in a famous series of books. These two huge islands were both part of the ancient continent of Gondwana, and were not (until modern times) inhabited by animals from Asia. As Gondwana broke up, its two main pieces had marsupial mammals. Eutherian mammals had not arrived from Eurasia. 

This high level of endemism is explained by the continent's long geographic isolation and its tectonic stability (few earthquakes, volcanoes and recent mountain formations). Australia has few placental mammals. Marsupials occupy many of the ecological niches which placental animals occupy elsewhere in the world.
Marsupials are a group of mammals that raise their young in a pouch, including the macropods, possums and dasyuromorphs. 

Australia is home to two of the five known species of monotremes and has numerous venomous species, which include the platypus, spiders, scorpions, octopus, jellyfish, molluscs, stonefish, and stingrays. Uniquely, Australia has more venomous than non-venomous species of snakes.

The settlement of Australia by Indigenous Australians was between 48,000 and 70,000 years ago. Research in 2011 using DNA suggested an arrival around 50,000 years ago. Europeans came from 1788, and significantly affected the fauna. Hunting, the introduction of non-native species, and land-management practices involving the modification or destruction of habitats have led to many extinctions. Some historical examples include the paradise parrot, pig-footed bandicoot and the broad-faced potoroo. Unsustainable land use still threatens the survival of many species. To protect the survival of its fauna, Australia has passed wide-ranging federal and state legislation and established protected areas.

HD 100546

HD 100546 or KR Muscae is a star. It is a pre-main-sequence star. It is 361.4 light-years away from the Earth. In the night sky, it is in the constellation of Musca. It has one planet. The plant is 6.5 AU away from HD 100546. The star has a disks of dust and rocks around it. One of these disk is 0.2 to 4 AU from the star and another is 13 AU out to a few hundred AU. Scientists think there might be a protoplanet between these two circumstellar disks, around 47 AU from the star.

Scientists believe this star is 10 million years old.

The planetary system contains at least 3 members: "HD 100546 b" and a protoplanet forming in denser regions of the circumstellar disks (c).
"HD 100546 b" or "KR Muscae b" is a large gas giant exoplanet or a sub-brown dwarf star orbiting HD 100546 6.5 AU away from its host star. HD 100546 b might be the largest exoplanet discovered because it is exactly 7.0560720927 times the diameter of Jupiter which is 986,580 km.

The Hubble Space Telescope observed a complex spiral pattern in the circumstellar disks. The young protoplanet designated "HD 100546" c or "KR Muscae C", is a possible exoplanet forming 47 AU away from the host star. It has the temperature of 227 K (or -46.15°C).

Mission: Impossible III

Mission: Impossible III is a 2006 American action spy movie directed by first-time director J. J. Abrams and is the third movie in the "" series. It stars Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ving Rhames, Billy Crudup, Michelle Monaghan, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Keri Russell, Maggie Q, Simon Pegg, Eddie Marsan and Laurence Fishburne. The movie was distributed by Paramount Pictures.

The movie had several changes in directors. The development for a third "Mission: Impossible" movie started in 2002, with David Fincher being the intended director. He left due to creative differences. His replacement, Joe Carnahan, also left the movie production in July 2004 due to the same reason. Abrams was hired months later after he was approached by Cruise, who wanted him to direct the movie as he was a fan of Abrams' "Alias" (2001–2006). However, this caused the movie to be further delayed due to Abrams' contract obligations for "Alias" and "Lost" (2006–2010), which resulted in potential cast additions such as Kenneth Branagh, Carrie-Anne Moss and Scarlett Johansson to leave. Principal photography began in July 2005 and ended in October. Filming locations include Shanghai, Berlin, Rome, Los Angeles, and the Vatican City.

"Mission: Impossible III" premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 26, 2006, and was released in the United States on May 5. The sequel, "", was released in 2011. 

In 2002, director David Fincher was supposed to direct the next movie of the "Mission: Impossible" series. It was intended to be released in the summer of 2004. Fincher eventually dropped out because he wanted to focus on "Lord of Dogtown" (2005). He later said that it was due to creative differences in the direction of the movie. Joe Carnahan was chosen to replace Fincher, and worked on developing the movie for fifteen months. Under Carnahan's direction, the movie would have featured "Kenneth Branagh playing a guy who's based on Timothy McVeigh," as well as Carrie-Anne Moss and Scarlett Johansson in other roles. 

Carnahan quit in July 2004 due to a dispute over the movie's tone. J. J. Abrams was then offered the director's role by Tom Cruise after he had binge-watched the first two seasons of "Alias". Abrams eventually signed on and production was delayed due to his contract obligations with "Alias" and "Lost". Due to the delay, Branagh, Moss, and Johansson departed from the project. Ricky Gervais was cast as Benjamin Dunn, but also left the project due to scheduling conflicts with "For Your Consideration" (2006) as a result of production delays. On June 8, 2005, the movie was given the green light by Paramount Pictures after a new cast of actors was hired and the movie's budget was redeveloped, and Cruise took a major pay cut. 

On Rotten Tomatoes, 71% of 225 ratings are positive. The average rating is 6.60/10. On Metacritic, the movie has a score of 66 out of 100 based on 42 critic reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".

Action Max

The Action Max is a home video game console. The games that run on it came on VHS tapes. It was made in 1987 by Worlds of Wonder. Its release was limited outside the United States.

The Action Max requires a VCR because it cannot play VHS tapes. Light guns are used to simulate shooting the screen. The games are played by getting or losing points depending on how good the shots are, making it not possible to win or lose. The system lost popularity quickly because of this and the only games for it were light gun games of different themes that play the same way every time.

The red sensor must be placed on the bottom right corner of the television screen. The games contain a black circle there that flashes white quickly when something can be shot. The targets flash at the same time. These are used to see if something has been hit. The targets that flash the exact same are enemies, adding points. The targets that flash wrong are friendly, losing points.

All of this allows games to be stored on any format, not just VHS, as long as the video is made to work with the light gun.

Five VHS tapes came out for the system:

A planned sixth cassette, "Fright Night" (possibly based on the 1985 horror movie of the same name), did not come out because the Action Max was discontinued.

Amphoteric oxide

Amphoteric oxides are oxides which have properties of both acidic and basic oxides. The property is known as amphoterism. Generally non-metallic oxides are acidic and metallic oxides are basic. Some non-metallic oxides are neutral and some metallic and semi-metallic oxides are amphoteric. 

As these oxides can act as either an acid or a base, they can neutralize both acids and bases. For example, aluminium oxide (AlO) reacts with hydrochloric acid to form aluminium chloride and water. With sodium hydroxide solution it reacts into sodium aluminate (NaAlO) and water. 

Amphoteric oxides have both acidic and basic properties. The oxides of aluminium and zinc can be used as examples. They react with acids and alkalis to form salts and water. The metals become cations in the former case and oxoanions in the latter. 

Examples:

ZnO(s) + 2 HNO(aq) → Zn(NO)(aq) + HO(l)

ZnO(s) + 2 NaOH(aq) → NaZnO(aq) + HO(l)
AlO(s) + 6 HCl(aq) → 2 AlCl(aq) + 3 HO(l)

AlO(s) + 2 NaOH(aq) → 2 NaAlO(aq) + HO(l)
ZnO, BeO, AlO, MnO, CrO, PbO, SnO are all amphoteric. 

Zincates (ZnO) and aluminates (AlO) have the ending -ate to show that their ions are compound ions containing oxygen – rather like sulfates, carbonates and nitrates. Note that sodium zincate and sodium aluminate are soluble in water.

Later, he opened his own men’s clothing shop on the ground floor of historic Palmer House Hotel in Chicago. During World War II, he served in the US Navy and was assigned in the Southwest Pacific.

He met Irv Robbins when he began dating Robbins' sister in 1941. He soon married into the family, became good friends with Robbins, and the two men decided to go into the ice cream business. At the suggestion of Robbins' father, however, they each opened separate stands, so that each man could better understand the responsibilities of running their own business. Baskin opened his Burton's ice cream stand in 1945, while Robbins opened a shop called Snowbird. They each had several stores by the time they merged in 1948, forming the company that was renamed Baskin-Robbins in 1953.

The company had 43 stores by the end of 1949, more than 100 by 1960 and about 500 when the ice cream empire was sold to United Fruit Company for an estimated $12 million in 1967. Robbins stayed involved with the company for 11 more years and retired in 1978. Twenty-five years later, Baskin-Robbins had become the world's largest chain of ice cream stores, with 5,500 outlets around the world.

Baskin died from a heart attack at his home in Studio City, California on December 24, 1967.

After a period of stagnation at the turn of the 21st century, Botswana's economy had strong levels of growth, with GDP growth exceeding 6-7%. Botswana has been praised by the African Development Bank for sustaining one of the world's longest economic booms.

Botswana's sharp economic growth was because of built on a foundation of diamond mining, prudent fiscal policies, international financial and technical assistance, and a cautious foreign policy. Botswana's economy is mostly dependent on diamond mining. Diamond mining contributes to 50% of the government revenue. It is the least corrupt country in Africa in the Corruption Perceptions Index by international corruption watchdog Transparency International.

Nation (novel)

Nation is a book by Terry Pratchett. It was published in 2008. Harper Collins published it. Unlike most of Terry Pratchett's books, it is set in a world that is like the real world and not a fantasy world. Pratchett wrote "Nation" for children to read.

The world of "Nation" has an England and a France in it. It also has a "Pelagic Ocean", which is not really the Pacific Ocean. The story is set in the 1860s.

Most of the story happens on an island in the "Southern Pelagic Ocean" after a giant wave kills almost all of the people who lived there. The people who lived on the island, and their culture, are "the Nation".

The main character, a teenager named Mau, was on a canoe trip when the wave came, so he did not die. He comes back home to the island to find everyone gone. The other main character, an English girl called Daphne, was shipwrecked on the island by the wave. Soon, other people from other islands show up. Mau, Daphne, and the new people rebuild the Nation together.

Meanwhile, the King of England and most of his family have died in an epidemic. Daphne's father is the next person in line to be King of England. There is an English ship looking for Daphne and her father.

Mau had been on a trip to the Boys' Island to become a man. In the Nation, boys go to the island for thirty days to live alone. When they come back, they are given a ceremony that makes them men. The ceremony has a feast, tattoos, and ritual circumcision. The boy is supposed to leave his "boy's soul" on the boy's island, sail home, and then get a "man's soul" after his feast.

Because Mao is in between being a boy and a man, he thinks he has no soul. Mao often thinks that he is like a hermit crab that has left one shell but not found another one yet. Because of this, Mao and other people wonder if demons and other evil spirits will get into Mao's body.

Mau believes he can hear the voices of "the Grandfathers", who are old men whose spirits watch over the Nation. They order him around telling him to rebuild the Nation's god-anchors (altars) and perform the rituals and chants that made up the culture. Many of the characters in the book ask whether God or the gods are real because they allowed a bad thing to happen: the wave that killed so many people. Mau often says he doesn't think the gods exist, but he can see the god of death, Locaha, who talks to him.

On the island, Mau, Daphne, and the refugees rebuild the farm and buildings on the island, defeat raiders and mutineers, and discover an underground museum that Mau's ancestors built. Daphne believes that the island had once been much bigger during the Ice Age and that the Nation's ancestors could build telescopes, eyeglasses, metal tools and ships that could sail long distances. Daphne believes that many of the stories and songs that Mau has told her are really about planets and sailing around the world.

Daphne's father comes to the Nation looking for Daphne. Then the ship from England comes to the island looking for Daphne's father, and they crown him king of England.

Mau and the other people in the Nation decide that they do not want to become part of the British Empire. Instead, they ask to join the Royal Society, the group of British scientists founded by Isaac Newton. Mau says any scientist from any other nation may come to the Nation to look at the very old museum. These scientists will pay the people of the Nation by teaching them everything they know.

In an epilogue, the last chapter of the book, it is the twenty-first century. The Nation is full of scientists but has kept its own culture. An old man tells two young children of the Nation about Mau and Daphne and how to use an old telescope.

James Hynes of the "New York Times" thought the book was good. He liked the characters, the story, and the way the book looked at the way powerful countries treat smaller countries and religion. He called it "both a high-spirited yarn and a subtle examination of the risks and virtues of faith."

Zack Handlen of "The AV Club" thought the book was mostly good but had a few problems. He liked the story and characters and Terry Pratchett's use of humanism, which is a way of thinking about society.

"Nation" won many awards:

Claudius Gothicus

Claudius (10 May 214–September 270 AD) was Roman emperor from 268 to 270. After 269, he was called "Gothicus" because of his military victories against the Goths.

Claudius () may have come from Illyricum in the Balkans, part of the Roman Empire. Latin historians (the authors of the "Epitome de Caesaribus" and the "Historia Augusta") wrote that Claudius was the son of the emperor Gordian III, or was related to the emperor Probus. These claims are not true.

The "Historia Augusta" says that Claudius was a military tribune () in the army of the emperor Decius. After that, the "Historia Augusta" says that Claudius was leader of a Roman legion () in the time of the emperor Valerian. Next, the "Historia Augusta" says that Claudius was governor of all Illyricum () when Gallienus was emperor. The Latin historian Aurelius Victor and the Greek historian Zonaras wrote that Claudius was a tribune () at Ticinum (Pavia, Italy) in 268.

Claudius became emperor in September or October 268. Soon afterwards his armies overcame the Alemanni in a battle at Lake Garda on the Italian Peninsula. Claudius got the title because of this success over the Germanic peoples. For the first winter of his reign (268–269) he may have been in Rome. In 269, Claudius was Roman consul. He and his armies overcame the Goths in a battle at Naissus (Niš, Serbia). After this, Claudius got the name , because of his victory over the Goths.

In September 270, Claudius Gothicus died of plague in Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia). He was deified (made into a god), with the name in .

Claudius Gothicus had a brother, Quintillus.

In the time of the later emperor Constantine the Great, the "Historia Augusta" says that Claudius Gothicus had another brother with the name Crispus and a sister with the name Constantina. The "Historia Augusta" also says that Claudius had a daughter with the name Claudia. This is not true.

Most species are primarily found in forests. They look similar to the African duikers and the Asian muntjacs, but they are not related. About 10 species of brocket deer are described.

The genus name "Mazama" is derived from Nahuatl "mazame", the plural of "mazatl" "deer".


Depending on species, brocket deer are small to medium-sized with stout bodies and large ears. The head-and-body length is , the shoulder height is , and the typical weight , though exceptionally large "M. americana" specimens have weighed as much as . When present, the antlers are small, simple spikes. The pelage varies from reddish to brown to gray. Very roughly, the species can be divided into four groups based on size, color, and habitat (but not necessarily matching their phylogeny):


In addition to being small and nocturnal, "Mazama" species are shy and are thus rarely observed. They are found living alone or in mated pairs within their own small territory, the boundaries usually marked with urine, feces, or secretions from the eye glands. When threatened by predators (primarily the cougar and the jaguar), they use their knowledge of their territory to finding hiding places in nearby vegetation. As herbivores, their diet consists of leaves, fruits, and shoots.

Mated pairs that live together remain monogamous. Single male deer usually mate with nearby females. When males compete for a mate, they fight by biting and stabbing with their short antlers. Brocket species that live in tropical areas have no fixed mating season, but those in temperate areas have a distinct rutting period in the autumn.

The gestation period is roughly 200–220 days and females bear only one fawn at a time. The young stay with the mother, keeping concealed until large enough to accompany her. They are normally weaned around six months of age and reach sexual maturity after a year.

Wind phone

The wind phone () is a telephone booth in the town of Ōtsuchi in Japan. People go to the wind phone to say things to their family members or friends who have died. It was built by Itaru Sasaki, a garden designer, in 2010, after his cousin died. In 2011, after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami killed over 15,000 people in the area, he opened the wind phone so everyone could use it. Over 30,000 people have gone there since then. People have built copies in different countries, and there are books and movies about it.

In 2010, Itaru Sasaki, a garden designer from Ōtsuchi, learned that his cousin had cancer and had three months to live. After his cousin died, Sasaki built an old telephone booth in his garden in December 2010, so that he could feel a connection to his cousin by "talking" to him on the phone. He said that the wind phone was not related to religion, but helped him deal with the loss. He also said that he wanted his thoughs to be "carried on the wind".

The wind phone is a white telephone booth with glass windows. Inside, there is a black telephone on a metal shelf. The telephone is not connected to anything. Next to the telephone, there is a book so visitors can write notes about the people that they miss.

In 2010, a tsunami killed over 15,000 people in the area, including over 1,200 people in the town where Sasaki lived. After the tsunami, he opened the wind phone so that everyone could call their friends and family who had died. Now, it has been visited by over 30,000 people.

On January 7, 2017, strong winds ripped off the roof of the wind phone and broke the glass doors. People in the area quickly helped to fix it on January 10, and the wind phone was fixed by the next day. In April 2018, Sasaki said that the wood and metal parts of the booth were damaged, and that he wanted to build a new booth that would not be damaged as fast. People gave money to buy a new booth, and Sasaki built the new, stronger booth in August 2018.

Many copies of the wind phone have been built around the world. In Oakland, California, artist Jordan Stern built a wind telephone in February 2017, to remember the 36 people who died in the 2016 Oakland warehouse fire, including his friend.
Altrúchas, an art group in Dublin, Ireland, built a wind phone ("fón gaoithe") on a mountain named Two Rock in August 2017. The wind phone was built from old supplies, and they were not actually allowed to build it. It was destroyed for unknown reasons less than two weeks after it was set up. Altrúchas later said that the destruction was "a strong statement from people that didn't like the project", but that they would not let it "take away from the positivity of the project".

Tomohiko and Kazuko Kutsuna, a married couple in Aichi Prefecture in Japan, built a red copy of the wind phone in 2018. It was called the "phone of the sea breeze" ("shiokaze no denwa"), and it was built to remember of one of Kazuko's students, an 18-year-old woman who died by suicide in 2009.

Ten local artists helped to build a temporary wind phone in January 2020 in Provincetown, Massachusetts. In October 2020, Susan Vetrone and Steve Reed built a wind phone in North Carolina. Vetrone started the project when her mother died and she learned about the Ōtsuchi wind phone, saying: "I wanted it to mirror – almost exactly if it could – the Japanese phone booth that brought so many people comfort."

In March 2021, a wind phone was built on Aspen Mountain in Colorado. According to the artist, who did not give their name because they were not allowed to build it in a United States national forest, the wind phone was built to help people deal with deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic.

In September 2022, "Le fil du vent Chelsea wind phone" was opened to the public, in Chelsea, Quebec. This unique resource was inspired by the Japanese example and offers a private refuge for the longings of grief to be heard, honoured and carried away on the wind. 

Sasaki, who built the Ōtsuchi wind phone, wrote a book titled "Kaze no Denwa – Daishinsai Kara Rokunen, Kaze no Denwa o Tooshite Mieru Koto" ("The Phone of the Wind: What I Have Seen via the Phone in the Six Years Since the Earthquake") in 2017. The book was published by Kazama Shobo.

The 2020 book "The Phone Box at the Edge of the World" by Italian writer Laura Imai Messina tells the story of a woman who loses her family in the Tōhoku tsunami and goes to the wind phone, where she meets a man and his daughter who have also lost a family member in the tsunami. The book was based by Messina's visit to the Ōtsuchi wind phone in 2011.

"The Phone Booth in Mr. Hirota's Garden", a 2020 book by Canadian writer Heather Smith, is a fiction version of the wind phone's story. Smith said that she wanted to write the book after she heard a National Public Radio podcast about the wind phone. She emailed Sasaki while she wrote the book, and said that it "was a thrill to receive his blessing."

The 2019 Austrian short movie "The Wind Phone", written and directed by Kristin Gerweck, is about seven fictional strangers who visit the Japanese wind phone. Gerweck wrote the movie when she learned about the wind phone after her grandmother's death, saying that it was a "beautiful story".

"Voices in the Wind" () is a 2020 Japanese drama movie about a fictional high school student whose family died in the Tōhoku tsunami and who goes back to her town to visit the wind phone years later. The movie director Nobuhiro Suwa, who went back to Japan to make the movie, stated: "Going there eight years later, you can't see much of the damage, it has been rebuilt. But people's feelings have not been fixed."

Prehistory of Kangleipak

The Prehistory of Kangleipak or the pre-literary history of Manipur is the period of human history between the first use of stone tools by early men and the time just preceding Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur).
Comparing with other regions of the world, the development process of the archaeological work in Manipur is of recent times. The pioneering work in archeology was initiated by O. Kumar Singh. Before his presence, there was little information on the existence of the stone culture of Manipur.
O. Kumar Singh is of the view that "Pre-Historic people used to settle in the hills during the Paleolithic and Mesolithic (Hoabinhian) culture while Neolithic people lived in both hills and valley. They came down to the valley at least by about 2000 BC." On the basis of the characters of the tool industry, the prehistory of Manipur is broadly classified into three periods.

Paleolithic period is the most primitive stone culture era. The Paleolithic period varies from place to place.
In Manipur's neighbouring country Burma (Myanmar), the lower Paleolithic culture started from 750000 to 275000 BP. The Homo erectus (early Anyathian culture) began to settle on the banks of the Ayeyawaddy river in Burma in 750000 BCE.
However, in case of Manipur, Paleolithic period started from 20,000 to 10,000 BCE.

The stone culture of Paleolithic period were discovered from the five archeological sites, Songbu, Khangkhui, Machi, Nongpok Keithel Manbi and Singtom.

The Mesolithic period (Hoabinhian period or post Paleolithic period or pre Neolithic period) has two remarkable archeological sites in Manipur. These are the Nongpok Keithelmanbi and the Tharon cave.

The Neolithic period is the last of the three Stone Age periods. It has 4 archeological sites in Manipur.
These are (1) Napachik, (2) Laimanai, (3) Phunan, (4) Nongpok Keithelmanbi.

Roland Barthes

Roland Gérard Barthes (; ; 12 November 1915 – 26 March 1980) was a French philosopher.

Roland Barthes was born in 1915 Cherbourg in Normandy. His father was killed during World War I before his first birthday. He was raised by his mother, his aunt and grandmother in Bayonne. Barthes moved to Paris at the age of 11 with his family. Barthes was student in literature from 1935 to 1939 at the Sorbonne. 

In 1948, he taught with short-time positions at institutes in France, Romania, and Egypt. Then he studied lexicology and sociology and began to write bi-monthly essays for the magazine "Les Lettres Nouvelles", a collection that was published in 1957. Consisting of fifty-four short essays, between 1954–1956, "Mythologies" were acute reflections of French popular culture ranging from an analysis on soap detergents to a dissection of popular wrestling. Barthes taught at Middlebury College in 1957 and befriended the English translator of his work, Richard Howard, in New York City. He taught in his classes at Middlebury. "Michelet" and "Writing Degree Zero" were published in France.

Barthes developed his literary criticism with new ideals of textuality and novelistic neutrality. In 1971, he was a professor at the University of Geneva and also taught at the École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS).

Here are some of his works:

Florianus

Florianus or Florian (died 276) was Roman emperor for eighty-eight days in 276 AD.

It is unknown when or where Florianus () was born. The "Historia Augusta" (a Latin history) says that Florianus was the half-brother of Marcus Claudius Tacitus. This information may not be correct. Tacitus was Roman emperor from the end of 275 until he died in the middle of 276.

The Greek historian Zosimus wrote that Florianus was praetorian prefect while Tacitus was emperor.

Florianus became emperor in around July 276, after the murder of Tacitus in Asia Minor.

The Latin historians Eutropius and Jerome wrote that Florianus was emperor for eighty-eight days.

The "Historia Augusta" says that soldiers of the Roman army murdered Florianus at Tarsus. This would have happened in around September 276. The "Historia Augusta" also says that Florianus had a cenotaph at Interamna (Terni, Italy).

Florianus was not deified (made into a god) but neither did he get "damnatio memoriae".

The "Historia Augusta" says that Florianus was the half-brother of Tacitus. Tacitus and Florian had the same mother, but different fathers. This information may not be correct. The "Historia Augusta" also says Florianus had many children. This information may not be correct.

Probus (emperor)

Probus (19 August 232 – September 282) was Roman emperor from 276 to 282.

Probus () was born in Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia) in the Balkans, part of the Roman Empire. The "Calendar of Philocalus" (a Latin calendar), the "Chronicon Paschale" (a Greek chronicle), and the work of the Greek historian John Malalas all say that Probus was born on 19 August 232.

The "Historia Augusta" (a Latin history) says that Probus's father's name was Maximus. However, another Latin history, the "Epitome de Caesaribus", says that Probus's father's name was Dalmatius. The "Epitome de Caesaribus" also says this Dalmatius was part of the family of the emperor Claudius Gothicus. Neither the "Historia Augusta" nor the "Epitome de Caesaribus" are correct, and this information in both histories is fiction. The "Historia Augusta" also says that Probus had the name Valerius, which is not true.

Probus was a soldier in the Roman army. The "Historia Augusta" says that Probus was in the army in the time of Valerian, and that Probus worked in the area of the Danube. "Historia Augusta" also says that Probus was in the army that fought against the emperors' enemies in Roman Africa and the Palmyrene Empire. (This information is probably not correct.)

In the time of the emperor Marcus Claudius Tacitus, Probus was probably a governor of the East ().
In summer 276, probably in July, Probus became emperor. At the time, he was in the eastern empire. (The "Historia Augusta" says that Probus became emperor in January that year, but this is not correct.)

Probus was Roman consul for the first time in 277. The writing of the Justinianic Code may mean that Probus was in Sirmium on 5 May 277. From 277 to 278, Probus fought a war against the Germanic peoples. In 277, Probus got the name because of his successes against the Goths.

Probus was Roman consul for the second time in 278 and consul for the third time in 279. In 279, Probus fought wars against the Isaurians in Asia Minor and against the Blemmyes in Roman Egypt. From October 279, Probus had the names , , (or ) because of his successes against the Goths, against other Germanic peoples, and against the Sasanian Empire (the Persians).

Between 280 and 281, there was a civil war in Roman Europe. Bonosus and Proculus made themselves emperors. The "Historia Augusta" says that this was at Colonia Agrippina (Cologne), but this may not be correct. Not long after this, Probus's armies overcame the armies of Proculus and Bonosus at Colonia Agrippina. Bonosus may have killed himself and Probus may have executed Proculus.

Probus was Roman consul for the fourth time in 281. In around 281, there was a rebellion in Roman Britain. The rebellion was stopped for Probus by Victorinus. The Latin histories of Jerome say that around 281, there was another rebellion in Antioch. There, Saturninus made himself emperor. The Greek historian Zosimus wrote that Saturninus was the governor of Roman Syria. Jerome wrote that soldiers in Saturninus's army murdered him at Apamea in Roman Syria.

Around the end of 281, Probus held a triumph in Rome. Probus was Roman consul for the fifth time in 282.

Soldiers of the Roman army murdered Probus at Sirmium in autumn 282, probably in August or September. The "Historia Augusta" says that he was buried in a mausoleum in Sirmium.

There may have been a "damnatio memoriae" on Probus, and the Romans removed his name from some inscriptions. Later however, possibly in the time of the emperor Diocletian, the Romans deified Probus (making him into a god). He got a new name in .

The "Historia Augusta" says that Probus had a sister with the name Claudia. This may be fiction.

Partition of Iraq

In the years after the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, some people have said that they support the idea of partitioning Iraq, or dividing Iraq into three (or more) separate parts (a Sunni Arab part, a Shi'a Arab part, and a Kurdish part). These parts could be loosely united as an Iraqi federation or be three separate independent countries.

Support for the idea of dividing Iraq into three (or more) separate parts came from various prominent Americans and Iraqis, including Joe Biden, Leslie H. Gelb, Edward P. Joseph, Michael E. O'Hanlon, Khamis Khanjar, Atheel al-Nujaifi, Rafaa al-Issawi, Ali Khedery, John Bolton, and Michael J. Totten.

The idea of dividing Iraq has been criticized by Ben Connable. Connable said that none of Iraq's major groups or political factions actually want to divide Iraq and that neither do the Iraqi people. Connable also says that Iran (Iraq's most influential neighbor) does not want to see Iraq get divided and that the United States can't actually do anything to force Iraqi politicians to agree to divide their country into three (or more) separate parts. Connable also says that the new independent countries in the area will be unable to work together if Iraq is divided and that the violence and ethnic cleansing in a partitioned Iraq is likely to be even worse than it is right now. (In a separate article, Robert Mackey likewise argues that the idea of partitioning territories did not have a very good track record in Ireland, India, and Palestine and is thus unlikely to work very well in Iraq either.) Connable also doubts that an independent Shi'a Arab state in southern Iraq would actually want to share any of its oil revenues with a poor, landlocked, and backward independent Sunni Arab state in western Iraq.

Polychlorinated naphthalene

Polychlorated naphtalenes, or PCN are the products that are made when naphtalene is treated with chlorine. In many respects, these substances are similar to Polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs.
PCNs are used as insicticides and as fungicides. Wood is often treated with PCNs to make it more resistant. Sometimes, they are used to produce water-resistant dyes and colors. Sometimes, they replaces PCBs in the form of artificial resins. 
Like PCBs, they are very poisonous. They cause chloracne when they have direct contact with the skin. There are other symptoms, such as being irritable, losing weight, and certain liver dysfunctions. Because, like PCBs, they take a long time to decay, they were classified as persistent organic pollutant in 2015.

Adelina Domingues

Adelina Domingues (née Engargiola; February 19, 1888 – August 21, 2002) was an American supercentenarian who was posthumously recognized as the world's oldest living person by the Guinness Book of World Records for the last three months of her life.

Domingues was born on February 19, 1888 in Brava, in Cape Verde, in modest circumstances. She married Jose Manuel Domingues in 1906, with him emigrating to the United States shortly afterwards and her joining him there (specifically in Massachusetts) the next year, specifically in 1907. Domingues did missionary work for the Church of the Nazarene in Africa and her birth place of Cape Verde and also engaged in vigorous street-corner preaching while she lived in both Boston and New Bedford in Massachusetts. Her husband Jose died from cancer in 1950. She lived alone until the age of 107, when she moved into a retirement facility, and also used a wheelchair in her last years. Only one of her children lived past their teenage years–specifically Frank Domingues, who died at age 71 in 1998, predeceasing his mother by four years. After her son Frank's death, Adelina Domingues's condition began to decline and worsen. Adelina Domingues attributed her longevity to eating vegetables and beans on a daily basis and also to abstaining from any form of both alcohol and tobacco for her entire life.

She died in Spring Valley, California (in the San Diego area) at 1:30 PM Pacific Daylight Time on August 21, 2002 from congestive heart failure at the age of 114 years and 183 days. She was the last remaining undisputed person born in the 1888 or before, although by 2002 Kamato Hongo of Japan was still believed to have been older.

Bush v. Gore

Bush v. Gore was a United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) ruling from December 11, 2000 that stopped Florida's manual recount because different Florida counties had different rules for deciding what should count as a valid vote. SCOTUS also disliked the fact that the Florida recount was limited to undervotes (rather than having "all of" Florida's ballots be manually recounted) and said that there was no time for a new recount in Florida since Florida's Supreme Court said that the Florida state legislature wanted Florida to take advantage of the "safe harbor" deadline on December 12, 2000.

In "Bush v. Gore", seven Justices (everyone other than Ruth Bader Ginsburg and John Paul Stevens) agreed that there were Equal Protection problems with Florida's recount, five Justices (everyone other than Ginsburg, Stevens, David Souter, and Stephen Breyer) said that there was no time for a new Florida recount, and three Justices (Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas) went a step further than this by saying that in addition to violating the Equal Protection Clause, Florida's Supreme Court also violated Article II of the United States Constitution by changing Florida's election laws.

SCOTUS's "Bush v. Gore" ruling got a lot of criticism but was also defended in a long 2001 law review article by George Mason University law professor Nelson Lund.

Pace v. Alabama

"Pace v. Alabama" was overturned over 80 years later by "McLaughlin v. Florida" and "Loving v. Virginia".

In 2010, M. Kelly Tillery said that "Pace v. Alabama" was one of the ten top worst SCOTUS decisions of all time.

The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge

The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge is an autobiography written by former United States President Calvin Coolidge. It was published in 1929, shortly after Coolidge left office.

Coolidge's autobiography has about 45,000 words, unusually short for the time. It was praised by Ray Long (editor of "Cosmopolitan" magazine) for describing the complete story of Coolidge's life and "the complete story of our country during the dramatic years of this generation." Coolidge was one of the first U.S. Presidents to write and publish an autobiography. Coolidge's autobiography talks about all of the important moments in his life, such as his childhood and youth, Governorship, Presidency, son's death, and retirement. It was criticized by some for being too obvious and not giving any new information that was previously unknown to the public. However, this trait of the autobiography was not that surprising as no one expected Coolidge to reveal some private government information and secrets in his autobiography (Coolidge was a very private man, despite his happy-going and cheerful public personality image). However, it was also praised for its relative shortness, considering that most autobiographies of the time were much longer. Coolidge's autobiography, in contrast, was about half the size of a novel. One of the most important moments in the book was Coolidge's belief that President Warren Harding would recover (in 1923) and then his surprise and inauguration following Harding's death.

The Coolidge autobiography was very popular when it was published, which is seen in the large amount of fan mail that Coolidge got afterwards and by the fact that many newspapers were willing to publish parts of the autobiography so that much more Americans could buy it and view it. Coolidge said that he hoped that his autobiography might guide and encourage the young men and women of America.

Hodges", which held that U.S. states cannot forbid people from marrying someone of the same sex.

History of the Jews in Namibia

The history of the Jews in Namibia spans a little over 150 years. Non-existent in Namibia before the 19th century, Jews played an important if minor role in the history of Namibia since that point in time, despite the fact that their population was always small. The most famous Namibian Jew was "businessman, philanthropist and Jewish communal leader" Harold Pupkewitz (1915–2012).

In the mid-19th century, Jewish businessmen from Cape Town named the De Pass brothers became the first Jews in what is now Namibia when they established a trading post on the Nawaqualand Coast. The De Pass brothers began the Pomona Copper Company in Pomona, Namibia in 1861. After Namibia became a German colony in the late 19th century, more Jews came to Namibia for business, et cetera. However, under German rule, only about 100 Jews lived in Namibia, most of whom lived in Swakopmund. After the German defeat in World War I, the newly created League of Nations gave South Africa a mandate over Namibia. The Jewish population of Namibia (which had close relations with the Jews in South Africa) began increasing after this point, and there were 400 to 500 Jews living in Namibia (mostly in Windhoek) in 1965 (however, Jews were still less than one percent of the total White population in Namibia during this time).

Because the League of Nations mandate for Namibia was cancelled by the United Nations and the fact that Namibia became independent, the Jewish population in Namibia dramatically declined since 1965, with only 60 to 100 Jews living in Namibia today. In spite of this very low number of Jews, Windhoek "has a Hebrew congregation dating from 1917, a synagogue built in 1925, a Talmud Torah, a communal hall, an active Zionist movement supported by generous contributions, and the only Jewish minister in the territory." Other than at Windhoek, the only other place in Namibia today where Jews live in is Keetmanshoop, where about twelve Jewish families currently live.



Emma Tillman

Emma Fanchon Faust Tillman ( Faust; November 22, 1892 – January 28, 2007) was the world's oldest living person for four days in late January 2007. She holds the record for the shortest period spent as the world's oldest person.

Emma Tillmann was born to sharecroppers in Sedalia, North Carolina on November 22, 1892, being one of 23 children and one of 15 children to live to adulthood. She moved to Connecticut together with her family in 1900 and was a member of her local church (the Metropolitan AME Zion Church in Hartford, Connecticut) since 1915, for a whopping 91 years in total. Tillman was the President of the Chancel Choir for 15 years and the church Secretary for 13 years. Since she could not find a job as a regular secretary due to discrimination, she had a career in catering, including baking cakes for both Katharine Hepburn's father and Jackie Robinson. Tillman's husband died in 1939, before the United States's entry into World War II, and she also outlived one of her two daughters. However, all of her Emma Tillman's siblings who moved to the Northern United States with her in 1900 ended up living beyond the age of 100.

Tillman died on January 28, 2007 and was survived by her 80-year-old daughter Marjorie and also by many other younger descendants of hers. She was the last remaining undisputed person born in 1892. She was succeeded as the world's oldest living person by 114-year-old Japanese woman Yone Minagawa.

V1400 Centauri

V1400 Centauri (or 1SWASP J140747 or J1407 for short) is a star. It is a main sequence star, similar to our Sun. It is in the constellation Centaurus about 434 light years away from Earth. 

It is not visible to the naked eye: you need a telescope to see it. It is only 16 million years old, which is a very young star. It is a variable star. In 2007, it was thought J1407 was eclipsed and orbited by a gas giant or brown dwarf with a giant ring system. In 2021, it was discovered the parent star is strongly variable, with a 5.4-year long magnetic activity cycle. This means it might not have a planet. The variation might be caused by the star itself.

There are 4 different types of writing styles for Mezuzahs: Beis Yosef, Arizal, Sephardi and Alter Rebbe.

In the United States, prices for Mezuzahs range from US$50 for a cheap mezuzah, $85 for a medium quality, and $130-150 for a high-quality mezuzah.

The idea for mezuzah comes from Deuteronomy, chapter 6: "And you shall inscribe them on the doorposts (mezuzot) of your house and on your gates."

Khmer Empire

Fake The Khmer Empire or Angkor Empire (Khmer: ចក្រភពអង្គរ, "Chăkrâphôp Ângkô" are the terms that historians use to refer to Cambodia from 802 CE to 1431 CE when the nation was a Hindu/Buddhist empire in Southeast Asia. The empire referred to itself as Kambuja or Kambujadeśa which are ancient terms for Cambodia. The empire grew out of the former civilizations of Funan and Chenla, and at times ruled over and/or vassalized most of mainland Southeast Asia and parts of Southern China, its control stretching from the tip of the Indochinese Peninsula northward to modern Yunnan province, China, and from Vietnam westward to Myanmar.

A notable achievement is the site of Angkor, which is located in present-day Cambodia, the Khmer capital when the empire was the greatest. The majestic monuments of Angkor, such as Angkor Wat and Bayon, show the Khmer Empire's immense power, wealth, art, culture, architectural technique, aesthetics achievements, and the variety of belief systems that the Khmer Empire had over time. Satellite imaging has revealed that Angkor was the largest pre-industrial urban center in the world during the Khmer Empire's peak in the 11th to 13th centuries.

The beginning of the era of the Khmer Empire is conventionally dated to 802 when King Jayavarman II declared himself "chakravartin" ("universal ruler", title equivalent to "emperor") on Phnom Kulen. The empire ended with the fall of Angkor in the 15th century.

Shin Yasuda

Shin Yasuda (安田伸, "Yasuda Shin", September 19, 1932 - November 5, 1996) is a Japanese saxophonist, comedian, actor, and composer. His real name is Hidemine Yasuda (安田 秀峰, "Yasuda Hidemine"). His nickname is Ya-san (ヤッさん), Mister Ya in English.

Yasuda grew up in the () in 1932. His father was from the Saga Prefecture and a right wing activist, but he soon started the fur and leather business. He moved to Kawasaki shortly after Yasuda was born and was evacuated when he was in the sixth grade from the . Yasuda then moved to (also known as Kakio, Kawasaki City), where his mother's parents' home lived and failed his grades when he was in the first year of the old . Aspiring to become a soldier, Yasuda applied to the , but due to his fail grades, he changed his career to the path of music and learned to use the cornet by himself.

While attending the new year at the Atsugi High School, Yasuda founded the brass band club, was in charge of the alto saxophone, and served as the principal. During his first year of high school, he was planning on attending the University of Tokyo or the Hitotsubashi University, but when Yasuda was in his third year of high school, he became interested in music and in 1951, he went to the Department of Instruments at the . However, Yasuda was not used to the feudal nature of the classical music world, and due to financial difficulties to keep paying a large monthly fee, he started a part-time job as a jazzman at an expeditionary force club.

Finally, when the Instrumentation Department was established at the Tokyo University of the Arts, it was moved there and completed in 1953. Since then, Yasuda has been active as a jazzman in Yokohama, Yokosuka, and . Yasuda later meets both Êtarô Ishibashi and during his trip to Yokohama. In 1953, he formed his own jazz band "The Four Devers" with Masahiro Ishida (saxophone), Yukio Tanizaki (bass), and Tetsuo Hino (drums) and performed in both Tokyo and Nagoya. At this time, Yasuda performed with Ishibashi's band. Later, after working in "The Five" where Ishibashi is the leader, Yasuda's first apperence was in the Nagoya club "Fernando" as a member of "Happy Furinance". (Emi Itō & Yumi Itō) also appeared in this club. From this time on, his name often appeared in the "Swing Journal" advertisement. In the fall of 1957, he joined with the performance of Êtarô Ishibashi.

Yasuda was in charge of the tenor saxophone (occasionally a clarinet) as a successor to Masahiro Ishida, who was suffering from drug overdose and retired to see a psychiatrist. With a serious personality, he was the only member to appear in "Adult Manga" 1,835 times. Also, in "Shabontama Holiday", he was known for his role as "Deputy Director of the Kintoto Movie Studio", a contender who teamed up with Osami Nabe, and kept yelling "Yasuda!" In the end. He also plays the role of reversing his position. Also, the method of playing the saxophone while making the bridge is also famous, and it is shown on stage and in some Crazy Movies.

Due to his serious personality, Yasuda was concerned about his lack of talent, and one of the people involved (including songwriter ) even said, "Shin Yasuda is a crazy baggage." He seriously thought about retiring once, but a friend said, "You're like the University of Tokyo at six baseball colleges." It's luggage that Yasuda just lost, but he hopes to do something someday, so it's interesting for all six universities."

He is also an actor and appeared in many movies and television programs. However, since Yasuda participated in Crazy Cats band as a music expert, he did not intend to act as an actor originally, but when he appeared on a stage play, "" and "The Fun", he realized that he started to study on a large scale. Yasuda is also as a songwriter, and he composed many songs like "Weekly Crazy" theme song, drama theme songs, drama and company songs, group songs, and gymnastics accompaniment. Later, he formed the band "Coelacanth" with Kenichiro Morioka and Hiroshi Minami, and released songs like "If Tanuki Was In The World". He also co-starred with Kei Tani's band called "The Supermarket."

In his personal life, he married beauty researcher Miyoko Takekoshi in 1966. Known to his loving wife, a joke called "Miyoko" was born. However, he was not blessed with a childhood treasure, and in his later years, Yasuda himself was forced to fight his liver cancer and underwent surgery but managed to keep up with it to the end. He died of in 1996 at the age of 64.

Boot loader

A boot loader is a program on your computer. It starts other programs, namely operating systems. Boot loaders run booting instructions so your operating system works and appears. This makes using your computer much easier than it would be otherwise.

Boot loaders work on all, or almost all, systems, from MBR (Master Boot Record) to UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface). If a boot loader does not work on your system, you may need to install a different one, use a different configuration, or fix the one it came with.

One of the most common boot loaders is the Windows Boot Manager, also known as bcdboot. It is the only official boot loader for Windows. It also comes preinstalled. Most of the time, there is no real reason to alter it. If you do alter it without full understanding, it is very hard to fix .

A common boot loader on Linux is the GRand Unified Bootloader Two, commonly known as GRUB2 or just GRUB. Other boot loaders include systemd-boot, syslinux, and LILO.

Straub v. BMT by Todd

Straub v. BMT by Todd is a 4-1 Indiana Supreme Court ruling which said that custodial parents can't bargain away child support even with a pre-sex contract. Justice Roger Owen DeBruler dissented, arguing that such contracts should be seen as valid and as being similar to insurance contracts, which the law allows even for responsibility in cases of negligence.

Ferguson v. McKiernan

Ferguson v. McKiernan is a 3-2 Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling from 2007 which reversed a lower court's ruling. The lower court ruled that sperm donor Joel McKiernan had to pay child support. In its ruling, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said that sperm donors would be less likely to donate their sperm if they were at risk of being forced to pay child support. The two dissenting Justices said that there was no basis in existing Pennsylvania law for the court's ruling.

Affine symmetric group

Flat, straight-edged shapes (like triangles) or 3D ones (like pyramids) have only a finite number of symmetries - ways to reflect or rotate it where it looks the same. In contrast, the affine symmetric group is a way to mathematically describe all the symmetries possible when an infinitely large flat surface is covered by triangular tiles. As with many subjects in mathematics, it can also be thought of in a number ways: for example, it also describes the symmetries of the infinitely long number line, or the possible arrangements of all whole numbers (..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...) with certain repetitive patterns. As a result, studying the affine symmetric group extends the study of symmetries of polyhedra or of groups of permutations to the infinite case. It also connects several topics in mathematics that were originally studied for independent reasons, ranging from complex reflection groups to juggling sequences.

LZ77 and LZ78

LZ77 and LZ78 are two lossless data compression algorithms. Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv published them in papers, in 1977 and 1978. They are also known as LZ1 and LZ2. 

Today, there are many variations of these algorithms. Examples of such variations are LZW, LZSS, or LZMA. Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) is a variant that was published in 1983, and that was used for the GIF format used by Compuserve, or the the DEFLATE algorithm used in PNG and ZIP.

They are both theoretically dictionary coders. LZ77 uses a sliding window during compression. Later, this was shown to be equivalent to the explicit dictionary constructed by LZ78. There are limitations though: The two methods are only equivalent when all of the data is to be decompressed.

Since LZ77 encodes and decodes from a sliding window over previously seen characters, decompression must always start at the beginning of the input. Conceptually, LZ78 decompression could allow random access to the input if the entire dictionary were known in advance. However, in practice the dictionary is created during encoding and decoding by creating a new phrase whenever a token is output.

The algorithms were named an IEEE Milestone in 2004. In 2021 Jacob Ziv was awarded the IEEE Medal of Honor for his involvement in their development.

In the second of the two papers that introduced these algorithms they are analyzed as encoders defined by finite-state machines. A measure analogous to information entropy is developed for individual sequences (as opposed to probabilistic ensembles). This measure gives a bound on the data compression ratio that can be achieved. It is then shown that there exists finite lossless encoders for every sequence that achieve this bound as the length of the sequence grows to infinity. In this sense an algorithm based on this scheme produces asymptotically optimal encodings. This result can be proven more directly, as for example in notes by Peter Shor.

Kōga Gengo

Kōga Gengo (February 16, 1839 - May 6, 1869) was a Japanese samurai from the Kakegawa Domain and a Bakushin, meaning a samurai who served under direct rule lord of the Shogun. He was a boarding captain during the Boshin War and commanded the paddle corvette "Kaiten" where he was killed during the Battle of Miyako Bay. 
Born on February 16, 1839 in the Kakegawa Domain, he was the fourth child of Hidetaka Koga, leader of the Kakegawa Clan in Totomi. In 1855, Gengo traveled to Edo and studied Rangaku with daimyo of the Sakura Domain, Guntaro Kimura. He returned to his province two years later in 1857, but in 1858, Gengo was inspired to study navigation and went back to Edo under the guidance of Kō Yatabori, who was the professor at the Gunkan Office in Tsukiji. In 1855, the 2nd Dutch Navy Training Mission, led by Willem Huyssen van Kattendijke, came to Nagasaki to set up a naval training center.

Gengo's older brother, Gunnosuke Gengo, along with Katsu Kaishu and Yadabori, was the only Kakegawa feudal lord to receive the first Nagasaki Dutch Navy training. However, by the time of the second period, even though he had not accepted any new people other than the Bakushin, the fact that Gengo went to Nagasaki meant that he had an informal tour of the training as a subordinate of Yadabori.

Gengo studied advanced mathematics in Dutch with two of his mentors Yadabori and Arai Ikunosuke , and published a book about naval tactics. He also learned both English and French. In 1859, he became a vassal of the Shogunate and was appointed as a warship training assistant. The following year, Gengo also served as a guardsman in Yokohama. In 1861, Gengo became professor of naval training.

He was latter appointed as member of the warship club and surveyed the Edo Bay. The following year, the Shogunate Ogasawara Islands Inspection Team, led by Mizuno Tadanori, boarded the Kanrin Maru to preserve the area as Japanese territory. Gengo commanded the sailing ship "Senshū Maru" to survey the area. He boarded the ship with Arai Ikunosuke as a surveyor of the sailing ship. It was difficult to cross the Pacific Ocean in winter with an old sailing ship, and the Senshū Maru was washed away and had a hard time. Although it is very short, there is a memorandum of Gengo at that time. In 1863, Gengo was ordered to survey the Osaka Bay by engaging in two round-trip voyages between Edo and Osaka to escort the young shogun, Tokugawa Iemochi. In May of that year, he was summoned to the warship group.

In July 1863, during the Shimonoseki campaign, which began with the bombardment of the Chōshū Domain by Western forces (British Empire, United States, France and The Netherlands), Gengo headed for Shimonoseki with the messengers dispatched from the Shogunate to the Choshu while serving as the captain of the "Chōyō Maru". According to a letter to his family, the messenger's mission was to dismiss the Choshu samurais because they occupied the Ogura Clan's territory, and the messenger headed for the Ogura clan territory succeeded this. The messenger who landed in Shimonoseki was killed by foreign soldiers. In the First Chōshū expedition, he set sailed to Aki and Buzen. He became the captain of the "Kishō Maru" and sailed to Osaka in 1866. 
In 1867, Gengo was assigned to a fleet of small ten-person warships. That same year, the of the Royal Navy arrived at the warship training center, and as the training began on November 5, he became the head of the warship training center and also served as a student councilor on November 26. The Boshin War began when Imperial forces clashed with the Bakufu troops at Toba-Fushimi.

Gengo was promoted to head of the Shogun naval fleet, but the Boshin War had already begun. After the surrender of Edo Castle, Katsu Kaishu had promised to hand over the warship to the Imperial government, but the Admiral of the Bakufu Navy Enomoto Takeaki refused to surrender, and the last remaining shogunate forces retreated including Arai Ikunosuke and Gengo. As a result of the negotiations, four warships, the "Kaiyo Maru", the "Kaiten Maru", the "Banryu Maru", and the "Chiyodagata Maru", were organized, but they were dissatisfied with the various measures taken by the new government. Enomoto decided to lead the fleet and escape after seeing the relocation of Muneya to Sunpu.

On August 19, the Shogunate fleet, whose flagship was the "Kaiyo Maru", carrying former Bakufu soldiers onboard the transport ship departed off the coast of Shinagawa. Gengo was made captain of the "Kaiten Maru". The "Kaiten Maru" was towing the slow-moving ""Kaiyo Maru"", but was forced to cut the towline due to a typhoon off the Bōsō Peninsula. Due to the storm, the front and center masts were folded, leaving only the rear mast, but they arrived safely at Matsushima Bay of the formerly Sendai Domain After that, the "Kaiten Maru" went north alone, and while the ship scouted the Kesen Port, they found "Kaiten" and captured it.

A sailing ship owned by the former Shogunate that Koga boarded when he headed for the Ogasawara Islands, was rented to the Sendai Domain. It was decided to be returned to the Tokugawa family, but it is said that the crew had taken it and engaged in piracy.

In September, the allies of the feudal clan surrendered one after another. The Shogun fleet carrying former Shogunate troops and other army units who still wanted to fight, headed for Hokkaido. Gengo was also among them the group as the captain of "Kaiten Maru".

The fleet arrived at Washinoki in the north of Hakodate on October 20, and the Battle of Hakodate began. The next day, the ship visited the Hakodate Port with the consort ship "Banryu Maru", and on the 25th, troops and sailors of the Bakufu Army landed on the island and occupied cities from Imperial Japanese troops. On the 27th, the Akita clan warship "Kaohsiung Maru", which did not know about it, arrived at the port, so Gengo had his fellow officers of both "Kaiten Maru" and "Banryu Maru," lead a group of sailors and capture the Imperial ships, including the ironclad "". In a battle with soldiers of the Matsumae clan (who had sworn their allegiance to the new government), Gengo supported the Bakufu Army, and when the "Kaiyo Maru" sailed around in Esashi, he went to rescue them, but he couldn't save it. After many ships were destroyed by the modernized navy, "Kaiten Maru" became the last flagship of the Shogunate Navy.

In March 1869, after hearing reports of incoming Japanese forces plans to captured Hokkaido, Gengo led a group of sailors and French Army advisors. Gengo seems to have been the center of the operation because of the belief that "Let's attack aggressively rather than waiting for the enemy". The flagship "Kaiten Maru", commanded by Captain Gengo, arrived at Miyako Bay along with the "Banryu Maru" and "Kaohsiung Maru", but due to bad weather, the "Banryu Maru" strayed and the "Kaohsiung Maru" broke down. Only "Kaiten Maru" entered the Battle of Miyako Bay. It had said that Gengo said in his final word before the attack, "Even my ship is enough to defeat the enemy." 
Gengo was fiercely commanding on the deck while being shot through the left foot and right arm by bullets, but as he charged at the sailors, he was shot through the head by a rifle bullet. He was 31 years old. The ship was taken command by Arai and retreated back to Hakodate on the 26th, and Gengo;s body was buried the next day. The place of his burial was a temple, but it is said that it was later reburied behind the Hekketsu-hi Monument. In 1931, his nephew and adopted child, Nobumasa Kōga, built a monument in the precincts of the Daikannon Light Source Temple in Komagome, Tokyo, near the former Kakegawa clan's residence.

Chowkur

Chowkur is one the remotest Tibetan settlements surrounded by number of Indian Villages. It is in Taluk of Periyapatna of Mysuru District, Karnataka state in Southern India. Chowkur is small village specifically for the Tibetan refugees, who have escaped Tibet from Chinese Oppression in 1959. The area of the settlement is 5 km (4 sq. mi), which was allotted for first Tibetan refugees who migrated from North India. The pin code of Chowkur is 571107 of Periyapatna post. Chowkur has two camps with 80 houses
Chowkur was formed in 1975, when many Tibetan refugees moved from northern part of India. Around 500 Tibetan refugees were relocated to Chowkur from Northern part of India such as Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, and Assam. Chowkur has two Tibetan settlements known as Rabtenling and Phuntsokling, which is also known as camp one and two. The settlement is named after a nearby place called Anna Chowkur. Government of Karnataka has provided housing facilities and field for cultivation to Tibetans with the help of other NGOs for the survival. During the early years, many of them survived with collecting woods from the nearby forest for cooking and slowly developed by owning gases. The history of Tibetan refugees settled in Chowkur itself is the history of its people as many does not know much about this remote settlement, not even other Tibetans. The history of Chowkur is recollection of memories of first-generation Tibetan refugee and official records.

The total population (2011) estimated is 700 number. Due to large number of Tibetan moving to west, the number of populations has been lessening. During the initial years, the population was less but, there was more birth rates in 80s and population increased. Today, the population can be estimated to 500 in decreasing number. The population record in Chowkur is collected by both Karnataka Government and CTA. The above estimated population record is referred in CTA population census. The population in other Tibetan settlement is more in number than Chowkur as the size of population has always been less.

The Official Language spoken in the neighboring area is Kannada, but the native Tibetan language is spoken by the residents. Due to social integration with other Indians, most of the Tibetan living in Chowkur are also fluent in Kannada as well. The younger generation speak Tibetan and Kannada in the region. Kannada is mostly used to communicate with Indians.
The religion followed by Tibetan is Tibetan Buddhism. There is no single person from other religion live in this small remote settlement. Tibetan Buddhism was followed by first-generation Tibetans and was ascribed to their children and grandchildren. Chowkur has its own small area for prayers and to conduct religious activities. Most of the prayers are done in their respective homes as everyone reserves on room in their home as prayer room. 

Chowkur does not have any official office in its function. It is officially under Periyapatna Taluk but, the functioning office is in Bylakuppe under Central Tibetan Administration. Chowkur is registered officially under Indian Government but, the welfare of the people is looked by the branch of CTA office. Thus, Chowkur is associated with both Indian and Tibetan administration for its functioning. Both the functioning offices looks after the welfare of Chowkur. The electricity and water were provided by the Taluk Office and other needs were look after by CTA (Office in Bylakuppe). Thus, the school and nursery were looked after by the CTA.

In the past, Tibetans used to go to the nearest market or bus stand by walk but, today the facilities have been improved. One can reach from Periyapatna bus stand. From Periyapatna, one must go by auto as Chowkur does not have bus facilities. It is 5 kms away from the nearest town, which is also a taluk of Chowkur. It takes 2 hours to reach Chowkur from Mysuru district. The nearest bus stand is Periyapatna, and nearest railway station is Mysuru Railway station. Chowkur does not have any Government transportation facilities and people use self-owned vehicle to travel to other places. On the west of Chowkur, there is another small village known as Panchavalli and one can reach Chowkur via Gonnikoppa. There is no direct bus or other public transportation to reach Chowkur from other towns or cities. So, the accessibility to Chowkur may seems little confusing to first visitors.

1.     Nursery and School:

Chowkur has small School and nursery for its children. The school opened in 1984 and nursery in 1982 with 10 students. The facilities were not good during the initial days and students were taught under the trees. The construction of school was done in 1986. The construction of school was funded by Government of India. The School and nursery were especially for Tibetan refugees to get modern education. So far, total of 3000 have graduated from the school and nursery. The school has classes from 1to 4 with one office and three classrooms. Thereafter, the student move to town for further studies from class fifth. Today, the nursery remains open but, the school was closed due to a smaller number of joiners in admission. But , in the past, the school has provided educational facilities to many Tibetan refugees so they can get further education. 

2.     Community hall

The community hall was provided for both the camps to perform certain activities such as meeting, functions, occasions, and other social gatherings related to the camp. Since both the camps share common social and culture background with similar social status, all the activities and social gatherings are done together in one community hall. The hall gives access to general meetings or official meetings done by Indian Government and CTA. Thus, the community hall provides facilities to the residents to conduct religious and cultural celebrations such as celebrating His Holiness Dalai Lama birthday, Tibetan New Year, and other important occasions. therefore, community hall facility plays an important role in livelihood of Tibetan refugees to preserve their culture and religion.

The average climate of Chowkur is Tropical Wet and Dry, which is favorable for its residents. Tibetans were used to the cold weather as the place is surrounded by forest. There are trees surrounded by the place which gives cooling weather throughout the year except for summer. The climate remains suitable from July to February but, the summer from March to June becomes too hot for the residents. During monsoon season, people cultivate Maize and Ginger depending on natural rain or irrigation. Though nearby Indian village grows Tobacco Tibetans chose to grow maize and sell it to CTA Government. The cultivation facilities such as loan, tractor and others are provided by CTA of Bylakuppe branch. On an average, few people do cultivation and rest of them are dependent on other source of income. The irrigation facilities are also provided by the CTA office.

Even though Tibetans do cultivation in Chowkur but, the main source of Income of the residents are Sweater business. It is common to know that majority of Tibetans in India do Sweater business for their living. Tibetan refugees do sweater business in different parts of India for six months, during the month of August to February. The business is carried out legally, following the rules and regulation of the nation[1]. Tibetans in Chowkur also consider sweater business as main source of Income for their livelihood. The members leave from the settlement in the month of August till February to earn for their family. The readymade sweaters are bought from Ludhiana, Punjab and are sold in different parts of India such as Kurnool, Nagpur, Tata Nagar, Ahmedabad etc.

Chowkur is a quiet place to live and surrounded by nature’s beauty with small pound. Chowkurians travel to other towns to buy groceries or other shopping as the settlement does not have any shop to purchase things. At the back the east side of Chowkur, there is forest area which covers other Indian villages too.

Nippon musekinin jidai

Nippon musekinin jidai ("Irresponsible Era of Japan") is a 1962 Japanese comedy film directed by Kengo Furusawa. It became one of the most popular comedy films in Japan with the box office earning around ¥350 million ($3,343,567.50 in US dollar).

The Crazy Cats comic jazz band and their featured singer Hitoshi Ueki did not invent the local genre of the "salaryman" comedy but they were its face in the 1960s. This film established Ueki's comic persona as a salaryman who would goof off at work and yet somehow always come out ahead, every so often bursting into one of his well-known Japanese folk-inflected songs while dancing something like the twist. The first in a series of "Irresponsible" films whose comic songs formed the soundtrack of Japan's high economic growth.

This movie was shot in color and cinemascope (TohoScope). The musical themes are "Irresponsible Ichidai Otoko" and "Hello, Until Then". This was the first memorable movie of the Crazy Movie series. The Crazy Cats, which became popular on "Shabontama Holiday" (Nippon TV) at that time, especially Hitoshi Ueki's big hit apperence on "Sudara Bushi". The series involved three main actresses (Sonomi Nakajima, Noriko Shigeyama, Reiko Dan), but it became unexpectedly popular, and 30 more were produced up to ""Nippon ichi no shokku otoko"" (directed by Takashi Tsuboshima) in 1971. In this play, Yasuo Tanami, who was an employee of the Toho Literature Club at the time, was originally involved in planning the President's Series, wrote the draft of the "Irresponsible Employee" as the antithesis of a loyal member of the company.

They sold it as a project for a movie starring Frankie Sakai, but the idea was scrapped due to poorly script writing, and when he left it as it was, producer Eizaburō Adachi asked Tanami to make a movie named after the success of Crazy Cats' music hit "Sudara Bushi", and he began to write the screenplay. When it was released, it was agreed, and it was a scenario where Crazy Cats members were assigned to act in the film.

The average Kuchihaccho and Tehaccho (Taira Hitoshi) heard the story of Pacific sake riding in the bar "Madrid". Hitoshi's first job, when he mentioned the name of a senior in his hometown to the president of Pacific Sake and worked in the general affairs department, was to acquire the president of Toyama Shoji, a major shareholder.

Success with a single check. Shimbashi geisha Manmaru is also cholera with his great ability, and promotion to chief of staff is a completely easy business. However, as Mika Tenka often said, Hitoshi was immediately fired when he learned that the kidnapper, Yuto Kuroda, had acquired Toyama's property. Kuroda's brain is Ryosuke Oshima, president of Sankai Foods, but his daughter Yoko ran away with her boyfriend Takasaku Ujiie. By the way, Hitoshi met Kuroda at the new president's inauguration party, but he returned with the outside director due to the skill of the show and the banquet. It is an unfortunate story for employees on the Taihei side that the traditional Pacific sake will become a subsidiary of Sankai Foods.

On the other hand, Kyoko, a geisha, and Aiko, a liquor secretary from the Pacific, ran to Tonton's boarding house and began to guess love. Hitoshi is fluttering with Aiko's fierce kiss. Around this time, Kuroda, who visited the Oshima Residence, cut the story of his daughter Yoko's marriage and discovered that he had a favorite partner, Takasaku Ujiie. Hitoshi's next job is to buy hops from Hokkai Bussan, a Pacific liquor business.

Hitoshi captured the president of the North Sea, Ishikari, who could not eat even if it was boiled or baked, with a pink film and a naked tatami in the room. However, Hitoshi, who simply doesn't wake up when he falls, discovers that Oshima and Kuroda are injured by Yoko's marriage and urges Ujiie's president to return to work, using Yoko's whereabouts as a seed. Who knows that Hitoshi, who appeared in a black tie at the Ujiie and Oshima families' wedding ceremony that day, is the new president of Hokkai Bussan!

Some bands such as The Tigers and The Jaguars, were formed by students who were influenced by The Beatles and Rolling Stones. In this way, even with GS, the musicality of each group varied considerably. The music industry at that time was still old, and entertainment professionals and record companies wanted to ask professional composers and lyricists to write music for GS upcoming songs.

Therefore, the Tempters and The Golden Cups, who played mainly their favorite Western rock music at concerts and recitals, felt a backlash. Some groups, like The Golden Cups, adhered to the policy of never playing singles like "Long-Haired Girl" at live performances. Jackey Yoshikawa & His Blue Comets and The Spiders became popular groups in the early days of the GS boom, and The Tigers, The Tempters, and Ox became popular in the middle and late stages of the GS boom.

The Spiders, The Blue Comets, and The Golden Cups were also popular GS comparable to them. In the 1960s, Japan was a society with a feudal side with strong fatherhood, and elements such as long hair and electric guitar were linked to badness and juvenile delinquency. Some high school students who went to see Group Sounds concerts were either suspended or dropped out to created their own band. Junior high schools and high schools prohibited going to concerts. At an outdoor concert at The Tigers' Nara Ayame Pond in November 1967, a fan fell and was seriously injured. NHK cut the appearance part of The Tigers that had already been recorded in "Grand Show of Song", and after that, with the exception of Jackey Yoshikawa and his Blue Comets who had short hair, long-haired group sounds were banned.

In May 1968, a concert admission ticket forgery by a high school girl fan of The Tigers also occurred. A series of girls fainted due to the fainting performance that Ox performed on the stage, and this triggered the antipathy of PTA and educators. To prevent accidents, theaters and local governments said that Group Sounds bands should not have concert venues. In the special feature of "Record Collectors", record companies appointed professional songwriters to the GS group who aimed to make their own performances by hiring songwriters such as Rei Nakanishi, Kunihiko Murai, Kyōhei Tsutsumi, Kunihiko Suzuki and other songwriters. 

In the 1960s, there were several professional female GSs, including Pinky Chicks, Chikako Matsuda, and Tokyo Pink Pearls. Only Pinky Chicks released a record. Some female GS members were able to release disco records in the 70's. Later, a surf rock-style Golden Half also debuted their records. Their album, "Beyond the Sun", was a cover of Astro Notes. Emy Jackson was a solo singer who made her debut on Philips Records as an English born citizen, but during the heyday of GS, Akiko Nakamura, Jun Mayuzumi, Michi Aoyama, Rumi Koyama, Aki Izumi and others also made their debut. Akiko Nakamura's "Nijiiro no Lake", Jun Mayuzumi's "Tenshi no Yuwaku" and "Koi no Hallelujah" were big hits.

Jun Mayuzumi's "Saturday Night, something happens" is a representative song of the female version of GS. In addition to the hit song, Ichiro Araki, a male singer and songwriter, released an ambitious work, "I'm in Rockland with you." The Genova's "Saharin's Light Doesn't Extinguish" and The Voltage's "It's a Man's Man's World" are examples of cult GS works.

The GS boom peaked around the summer of 1968, and more than 100 groups had made their record debuts, but in the spring of 1969, major members withdrew from popular groups such as The Tigers, The Carnabeats, and OX, and again. Jackey Yoshikawa and his Blue Comets even recorded songs on a mood song line. Around 1970, the GS boom came to an end, and in 1971, most groups were disbanded or disappeared. Among the people who served as lead vocals in the popular Group Sounds, many people continued to be active. 

From 1988 to 1990, a group called the Tigers Memorial Club Band was formed, and the hit songs of that time were released. In addition, Kyosei Iwamoto, who was imitating Kenji Sawada, was impressed by them and formed a band with Katsumi Kahashi, Taro Morimoto, Shiro Kishibe and The Tigers Mania among members of The Tigers in 1993. "Victim of Romance" has been released. Meanwhile, The Wild Ones were reunited in 1981 and are still active.

Jackey Yoshikawa and his Blue Comets did not dissolve and continued activities while repeating member changes, and after the death of Daisuke Inoue in 2000, the heyday We are returning to the organization of the remaining four people. Both The Tigers and The Wild Ones belonged to Watanabe Productions during the heyday of GS.

In 2002, Village Singers' "The Girl with Flaxen Hair" was covered by Hitomi Shimatani and became a smash hit. GS was treated for a long time as an "old-fashioned melody" after the boom had passed. However, research by Susumu Kurosawa, a GS researcher from the mid-1980s, and re-verification by Haruo Chikada have been carried out, and it has attracted some attention. The Mops are also evaluated overseas as "psychedelic rock" and "garage rock". In Japan, re-edited albums by label, albums by genre, and CD recurrences with the same paper jacket specifications at the time of release were released one after another. Kyohei Tsutsumi provided the songs for C-C-B, which appeared in the mid-1980s. At about the same time a younger generation of GS fans played GS-style songs mainly at live houses in Tokyo. Representative bands at that time include The Phantom Gift and The Collectors. This movement was featured in some media, but it was a small phenomenon. After that, Dixied, Emons and others inherited GS.

Even after the 21st century, GS-style rock bands and GS followers such as Kinoko Hotel, The Captains, and The Shallows have been born. Since 2010, bands such as The Juliannes was created by former Jackey Yoshikawa and Tsunaki Mihara of Blue Comets have been created.








Third plague pandemic

The third plague pandemic was a major bubonic plague pandemic. It began in Yunnan during the Xianfeng period of the Qing Dynasty in 1855. It gradually ended in the middle of the 20th century. The plague spread to Hong Kong, Guangzhou and other places in the 1890s, and then gradually spread to more than 60 countries and regions in the world. 15 million people worldwide died. 

In this plague, from 1898 to 1908, about six million people died in India. Other major epidemics include the Hong Kong plague and the Northeast plague. In 1894, Swiss-born French bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin successfully isolated "Yersinia pestis" in Hong Kong for the first time. In 1897, Russian borne French microbiologist Waldemar Haffkine invented the first human plague vaccine.

Cocoliztli epidemics

The Cocoliztli epidemics were a group of times many people in New Spain became sick. New Spain is Mexico and parts of South America today. The Cocoliztli epidemics were in the 16th century. Today, scientists do not know which germ caused the sickness. There may have been a few different germs. People had fevers and bled from their ears and noses. The Aztecs called this disease "Cocoliztli." The epidemic is divided into two groups, causing a total of 7 million to 17.5 million deaths. It was one of the deadliest epidemics in history and the worst epidemic in Mexican history. The first wave of epidemics broke out from 1545 to 1548, killing 5 to 15 million people (about 80% of the Mexican people); the second wave of epidemics broke out from 1576 to 1578 Between 2 and 2.5 million people died (approximately 50% of Mexico's people). Some historians believe that the epidemic may have been smallpox, typhus or measles, but none of these match the symptoms people had. Some people think this epidemic was a viral hemorrhagic fever, which was made worse by the severe drought at that time. Today, scientists think Salmonella was at least one of the germs brought to North and South America by the European colonists.

The word "cocoliztli" comes from the Nahuatl word for "pest" or disease, illness, and plague.

Antonine Plague

Antonine Plague (English: Antonine Plague), also named the Galen Plague (after the Roman doctor Claudius Galen), was a time from 165 to 180 AD when many people became very sick. Historians think they had smallpox.

People who caught the Antonine Plague had fevers, chills, diarrhea and pock marks that left scars.

History of smallpox in Mexico

The history of smallpox in Mexico started with Spain's conquest of the Aztec Empire in the early 16th century. Smallpox in Mexico has a history of 450 years. Smallpox was introduced to Mexico by the Spanish. It was an important factor in the fall of Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire. 

Before the arrival of European colonists, smallpox did not exist in the entire American continent. Hernán Cortés arrived in Mexico in 1519. In 1520, the first wave of smallpox killed 5-8 million people. From 1545 to 1576, up to 17 million people died from smallpox. The population of Mexico fell from over thirty million people to about 1.5–3 million by 1568. The spread of smallpox throughout Mexico followed the communication and trade routes throughout the country. There was another major epidemic between 1790 and 1791. This started attempts to stop the disease, with quarantines, inoculation, isolation and the closing of roads in New Spain. Charity boards were created, where rich people of the city donated money to build hospitals and to help and cure the sick. 

In 1803, Spanish doctor Francisco Javier Balmis started a vaccination program.

The Vaccination and Revaccination Act was passed in 1925, making it legally required for citizens to be vaccinated from smallpox and revaccinated every 5 years. Over 28 million vaccines were given from 1944 to 1949. Smallpox was declared extinct in Mexico in 1951.

Although it is not an actual descent operation, Furusawa himself appeared as a parachute member in the reproduction scene of the Palembang descent operation in "Kato hayabusa sento-tai " (Directed by Kajiro Yamamoto in 1944) who participated as an assistant director.

Credit titles in Crazy Cats movies and Wakadaishō series, using special credits that make the name pop out from the back of the screen, using aerial shots and bird's-eye shots a lot, playing "Gunkan March" in the play, etc. Known for his unique style, such as humming a "life theater" to a person.Kengo heard suspicious things such as " fell in love with him", or in opposition to , who always stood out in black, or in a white suit, hat, socks and shoes known as a stranger, such as standing in.

Once, he imitated 's story and warmed the actor's footwear in his pocket, but this actor made him foolish and said, "I thought he was impressed, but that idiot!" It was said that it was. The height of tension during the production was also famous at the studio. The instructions during the shooting were loud and yelling all the time. According to actress , this was unusual for Toho's director. Kengo was often injured during filming, and when he was shooting in a convertible, he sometimes fell off the car after saying "Action!" and couldn't say "Cut!", so he was seen walking with by other staffs. He had a habit of saying, "Turn the because anything is fine," and he was the type who proceeded with everything with momentum.

Kengo stated, "If there is no movement on the screen, momentum will not be generated." He is using a lot of techniques to always capture pedestrians behind even in indoor cutscenes, and sometimes preferred short cut scenes. also commented, "There were overwhelmingly more film changes than other directors' films." Even though the film magazine was empty during the film change, he said, "Why are you stopping the camera, turn it because it's okay!" And continued the production without filming. However, , the special effects director, also commented, "In reality, my personality was delicate, contrary to what I said and did, and I didn't leave it to the flow and momentum of the scene to shoot." At the beginning of ""Nihon'ichi no Goma suri otoko"", , who plays the main character of the film, is asked by his father (literally) to sesame, and two kittens are prepared in the bamboo basket next to it, and the audience's loveliness It was said that he had even calculated the part to calm his mind.

Also, when filming the sports game scenes such as "Young Guy at Sea", he put up a saying, "If you come to see it, you will listen to 's song," and participated as an extra to the large number of Kayama fans who came in. There was also one side of the idea man, such as getting it. In "Crazy Cats Movie", Mie Hama, whose acting theory was broken due to the heavy use of "hollow shooting" without too much context, was seriously worried and questioned, "You don't have to think about anything! According to the news article, Ueki was also worried about this. Ueki later said that when Takuya Fujioka, who participated in Furusawa's work for the first time, came to the shooting site, Furusawa said, "Mr. Fujioka, I am a director who pursues realism." When Fujioka asked Ueki if it was true, Ueki replied, "I wonder if the real we think is so different from the real he thinks." Toru Yuri is his favorite, and he often appeared in comedy stuff such as Crazy Cats film with Akira Hitomi, and was heavily used. There were many combinations with prodution designer , and he always called Muraki "Ms.!"

While directing his war movie "Siege of Fort Bismarck" (1963), he insisted that "special effects are not used because they are not powerful!" , the director of special effects, told him to try it without special effects, and he started shooting only with Furusawa, but in the end, Kengo apologized to Tsuburaya. After that, when he saw the result of the special effects, he prostrated, "It's Tsuburaya after all." From the standpoint of disagreeing with the Tokyo Tribunal, he continued to submit plans for "Asia no Arashi," which depicts the modern history of Japan, to Toho, but it was not realized due to Toho's corporate culture, which dislikes political topics. Kengo loved the "red color of the Hinomaru", so I was particular about the color of the title of my movie, and even rushed to the photo lab to make it a convincing "red color of the Hinomaru".

For this reason, at the photo lab, this red color that Furusawa imagined was called "pallet red." It was Furusawa's commitment that the last of Furusawa's works always ended with the title of "Pare Red". In his later years, he changed his name to Masatoshi, and made a living by selling fire extinguishers, managing parking lots, and controlling traffic at construction sites. He was also known for his dislike of the .

Unknowingly, Kengo visited the residence of , a master of left-wing movies and politically the enemy of the Toho Dispute, to sell fire extinguishers and returned his heels in a hurry. Director Shue Matsubayashi said of Furusawa, "That was really the right wing."

Great Bath, Mohenjo-daro

The Great Bath is part of a large citadel complex that was found in the 1920s during excavations of Mohenjo-daro, one of the main centres of the Indus civilization. The bath is built of fine brickwork and measures 897 square feet (83 square metres). It is 8 feet (2.5 metres) lower than the surrounding pavement. The floor consists of two skins of sawed brick set on edge in gypsum mortar, with a layer of bitumen sealer sandwiched between the skins. Water was evidently supplied by a large well in an adjacent room, and an outlet in one corner of the bath led to a high corbeled drain that disgorged on the west side of the mound. The bath was reached by flights of steps at either end, originally finished with timbered treads set in bitumen.

The significance of the structure is unknown, but it is generally thought to be linked with some sort of ritual bathing. Indeed, while lacking impressive palaces or monuments, Mohenjo-daro featured numerous baths—most homes had washrooms—and an extensive sewage system, suggesting that a priority was placed on cleanliness and sanitation.

Opioid crisis

The opioid crisis or opioid pandemic is the problems with opioid drugs. Too many people became addicted to opioids.

The crisis started in the United States in the 1990s. Since then, about 450,000 people have died from opioids in the United States. Most of the people who died took opioids as regular drugs and became addicted. Only a small number of people used the drugs illegally. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control, the opioid crisis costs $78.5 billion a year in the United States alone.

Opioids are moderately strong, to strong painkillers. Despite the high risks, associated with addiction and overdose, they are relatively easy to get. Opioids can have sedative properties. They are useful for treating acute pain; but they are not as effective when treating chronic pain. When looking at chronic pain, the risks often outweigh the benefits.

In 1996, the company Purdue Pharma wanted to sell a number of drugs containing opioids. They told doctors that patients would probably not become addicted, so the doctors prescribed opioids to many patients, even if they did not really need them. Many of those patients became addicted. In 2007, Purdue Pharma was fined $635 million. The judge said this was because Purdue Pharma did not warn customers about the side effects enough. Since then, there have been other similar lawsuits.

In 2017, more than 47,000 Americans died as a result of an opioid overdose, including prescription opioids, heroin, and illicitly manufactured fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid. That same year, an estimated 1.7 million people in the United States suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers, and 652,000 suffered from a heroin use disorder.

21 to 29 percent of patients given opioids use them wrong in some way. 4 to 6 percent switch from prescription opioids to the illegal drug heroin.

The opioid crisis affects women and men differently, For instance, women are more likely than men to become addicted. Women are also more likely to suffer chronic pain than men are. There are many situations in which women are to receive pain medicine. In cases of domestic abuse and rape, women are prescribed pain medicine more than men. Along with that, during pregnancy women may use prescription opioids to help with pregnancy pain, especially with post-pregnancy pain. The number of women that have died from opioid pain relievers has increased five times from what it was in 1999 in 2010. To help stop the spread of opioid abuse in women, it is advised that women are educated on the drugs that they are taking and the possible risk of addiction. Additionally, alternatives should always be used when possible in order to prevent addiction.

Illegal logging

Illegal logging is the name for different practices for the sale of timber in ways that break the laws of a country. This includes harvesting, which may be illegal and it includes the transport and sale of timber as well. It is an important problem to be solved. Illegal logging may include logging tree species which are protected by law, or logging them in places where it is forbidden. Illegal logging is a major factor in deforestation. It also threatens many species, because illegal logging may destroy their habitat.

It is estimated that illegal logging on public land alone causes US$10 billion in loss of assets and revenue annually. Good estimates show that more than half of the logging that is done globally is illegal. 

Illegal logging is a very big problem. It causes huge damage to forests, local communities, and the economies of many countries. The EU has implemented the European Union Timber Regulation as a way to stop the import of illegally sourced wood products. Scientists are finding new ways to find out where a tree came from.

Illegal logging leads to deforestation which leads to global warming. It also causes loss of biodiversity. Illegal logging encourages corruption and tax evasion. It also reduces the income small and large scale industries.

Toho Labor Dispute

The Toho Labor Dispute (東宝争議, "Tōhō sōgi") is a major worker strike at the Toho Movie Studio in Tokyo that lasted from 1946 to 1948. In particular, the third dispute in 1948 was a large-scale one when the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department and the United States Army, which were part in the occupation of Japan as a member of the Allied Forces, were dispatched to requisition the studio staffs. It is said to be the biggest labor dispute after the Pacific War. 
In early 1946, American journalist for the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, David W. Conde, visits Japan and was concerned about radical groups who are planning to sabotage Japan's reconstruction policy. He was hastened about the formation of a labor union at the studio and also set up a union party on how to negotiate with the company. Back in December 1945, the Toho Employees' Union (subordinate union) was formed in Toho due to the postwar turmoil and the rise of the socialist movement. The subordinates also joined the All Japan Trade Union Conference and frequently went on strike.

The labor movement was booming at once, partly because the Japanese Communist Party members such as Tadashi Imai and Satsuo Yamamoto were enrolled during the war. And with a huge force of 90% of employees and 5,600 members, they began to confront the company. The first dispute began in March 1946, and the second in October of that same year. The first strike was relatively mild. But the second one allowed the company to approve various new agreements, such as restrictions on working hours, by the workers. Due to the strike and the turmoil of the new agreement, movie shooting were not easily, and Toho produced 18 films, which was half than other companies.

In November, Kazuo Hasegawa, Ranko Hanai and others agreed with Denjirō Ōkōchi, who said that he would not be able to use the strike, although he was against the strike. A big star formed the "Flag of Ten People" and left the union. Director Kunio Watanabe also withdrew from the union, and employees in the distribution department who were in conflict over the policy formed a second union and withdrew. In March 1947, they formed Shintoho, mainly by the members of the "Ten no Hana no Kai" and more than a hundred volunteers who left the union at the same time. Although it was difficult for Toho to operate soundly, the management team at that time dared to leave the group as the "first production department" and the group leaving the group as the "second production department" in order to avoid a direct confrontation with the huge subordinate group.

In addition, new young actors such as Toshiro Mifune and Hajime Izu refused to joined the studio and left to do some cast audition. They were called the "Toho New Face".

In December 1947, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers issued an expulsion order to Toho, and the management team was replaced. President Katamaru Tanabe, was appointed as chairman, and the new president was invited from outside by Tetsuzō Watanabe, a former managing director of the Japan's Chamber of Commerce and Industry and a member of the House of Representatives.

Watanabe, who known as an "anti-communist" for some time, set up a hardliner as a director in charge of labor and a director of the studio, and on April 8, 1948, 270 employees of the Tokyo Dadeumi studio. Suddenly, the company fired him and his name was removed from the list. In addition, it announced a plan to dismiss 1,200 people to reduce personnel. 
On April 15, the followers entered the production control struggle, occupied the Tokyo Hibiki studio, placed materials and equipment under control, and made a barricade at the front entrance to prevent the police from enter the building. This marks the beginning of the Third Strike. On the other hand, the management side declared that the company will be closed on May 1 (which would latter celebrate as May Day). The subordinate group applied to the Tokyo District Court for a provisional disposition requesting the resumption of business of the company, but the company also applied for a provisional disposition requesting the release of possession and countered it. The following day, on the 14th, a court executive headed to the Shikkōkan Studio, but at this time, 800 members of the union members were denied admission.

The provisional disposition will be decided again on August 19, but before that, 2,500 workers stayed at the Hibiki Studio. Film directors such as Heinosuke Gosho, producers such as Akira Iwasaki and Takerô Itô, screenwriters like Yūsaku Yamagata, cinematographers like Yoshio Miyajima, and actresses like Setsuko Wakayama, Yoshiko Kuga, and Chieko Nakakita also participated. In front of the studio of each set, multiple large barrels filled with non-combustible paint were lined up, and a large fan for special effects equipped with a Zero fighter plane engine was brought out and installed on each barrel. When the police rushed in, the wind pressure used to blow gravel, glass fragments, and paint, which was actually used it. There was also a mechanism to drop a bag filled with pieces of wood and glass balls from the roof and windows.

A current-carrying trap was also set up. In the morning of the same day, Major General William C. Chase, commander of the 1st Cavalry Division of the U.S. Army, stationed at Camp Drake, a part of the Allied Forces that was engaged in Japan's occupation, sending 150 GI soldiers, armed with M1 carbines and 1 infantry vehicle unit. He led a platoon of six armored vehicles, three M4 medium tanks, and three aircraft to seized Camp Asaka. These units were US ground forces under the command of Lieutenant Henry F.T. Hoffman while Chase took command from the Air Force. At 8:30 AM on the same day, 2,000 troopers of the Metropolitan Police Reserve began to surrounded Dadeumi to assist in the execution of provisional disposition.

Getting on and off at the Seijogakuenmae Station and since the Odakyu Line was prohibited, the road leading to the Hibiki Photo Studio was blocked by protesters. At 9:30 AM, the chief of the Seijo police station (along with executive officer and the lawyer of the company's agency) boarded the US military truck and drove out of the station while being protected by a dozen police officers. Requested the acceptance of provisional disposition by the executive officer, they negotiated with the representative of the subordinate group. Around 10:30 AM, police reserve unit began to deploy at the front main gate of the Hibiki studio, followed by tanks. Film director Fumio Kamei put up a piece of paper to the reserve team in front of the main gate of the Tsuki Photo Studio, it read "Justice cannot be trampled by violence."

After that, the subordinates decided that it was impossible to resist by force because they were surrounded by the army, and held a staff meeting to accept provisional disposition. At 11:00 AM, 2,500 union members crossed their arms, sang "The Internationale" songs, left the studio, and withdrew to the Theater Institute. Subsequently, an executive officer entered the office and posted a notice of provisional disposition execution. At this time, the Toho Branch of the Nikkei Performance occupied the Toho Sales Department (cinema) in addition to the Toho Photo Studio. Businessman Tetsuzo Watanabe sought to break down the dispute from a commercial perspective, as the closure of the movie theater would directly affect the company's management.

Kunio Watanabe, the filmmaker of Toho, was sent to Toichi Mannen, the leader of the Foolish League, to ask him to strike a movie theater in Hibiya. Every day, Mannen attacked the movie theater with 50 to 100 subordinates, including "Komitsu" Mitsuya Kobayashi and "Shinjuku Emperor" Kano Mitsugu, and expelled the union members. He also demanded Toho for daily struggle costs, but did not receive a success fee. On October 18, Takero Ito and Yoshio Miyajima, the top executives of the union, met with President Watanabe and others. At this point, an agreement was reached to withdraw the dismissal of the remaining 250 union executives, in exchange for the voluntary departure of 20 union executives.

In addition, a large-scale freeze on personnel reduction was recognized, and the Third Toho Dispute was finally officially settled by the signing of a memorandum of understanding by the union and the company. In 1950, Toho dismissed 200 people whose dismissal was withdrawn due to Toho Dispute in the form of a red purge.

Since the February 1 General Strike, which was planned in 1947, was a large-scale labor dispute between government agencies, there was a tentative reason that GHQ / SCAP would be "contrary to the welfare of the people" in order to intervene. In addition, the cancellation method was a brute force but "peaceful" solution, in which the leader was made to broadcast the cancellation. However, despite the fact that this case was a labor dispute by a company, when he saw that he refused the provisional disposition of the court, he carried out a rough business of disbanding the labor movement by force.

At the time of the February strike, Commander-in-Chief Douglas MacArthur was very concerned about the eyes of the American people, as he intended to run for the presidential election the following year from the Republican Party. The Republican Party had a large support base for the labor union, and did not want to crack down on the Japanese labor movement and damage its reputation, so it did not move directly until the strike happen. Moreover, dispatching the army was nothing more than a matter of fact (except in the days of McCarthyism and the Red Scare, the Communist Party is legal in the United States, and the Communist Party of America exists as a political party. General MacArthur once put down the (alleging that they were being manipulated by the Communist Party) while serving in the National Guards.

However, MacArthur was defeated in the 1948 United States presidential election and was not elected as a candidate. From this time on, MacArthur did not have to worry about the eyes of the American people, and the Toho Dispute was forcibly died down at that time. In August 1948, the Soviet Union began setting up its forces around the Eastern Bloc due to the Berlin Airlift that ended Stalin's blockade policy and the United States, which cannot tolerate this communist activities by Russians, began setting up relationship with Japan in order to prevent this spread of communism. In any case, it was also an incident that showed that the GHQ / SCAP was no longer on the side of the communist-influenced labor movement.

The number of participants in the 4th Toho Dispute Strike was about 180 members at the Toho branch of the Japan Film Theater Labor Union (Nichiei) and 140 at the Hibiki studio, which is extremely compared to the 3rd Dispute. It lasted from May 17, 1950 to December 29, 1950, although it is not widely known because of its small number. Even after the end of the third strike in 1948, Toho continued to increase its popularity due to incongruity with internal factions and Shintoho, and its debt and other debts at the end of January 1950 were about ¥1.3 billion. It amounted to ¥150 million and there was an urgent need for new personnel reductions.

On May 17, 1950, the company announced a notice of personnel reduction for 300 people. The target of the arrangement was mainly the Japan's Motion Picture and Theatrical Worker's Union (JMTW), but in addition to that, the members of the National Film Theater Labor Union (All Screening Performance), which was born by splitting from the Nikkei Performance, are also targeted. Has become For this reason, the 4th Toho Dispute was led by the Japan Film Theater Labor Union (Nichiei), which is greatly affected by personnel reductions.

On May 24, Daiei and Shochiku studios also resolved to collaborate with the Niei Performance & Toho Photography Studio Branch. On May 25, director Kōzaburō Yoshimura also showed an opposition to the decapitation. On May 26, Isuzu Yamada announced that she would join the Japan Film Theater Labor Union (Nikkei). Support has expanded, with the Directors Guild of Japan and the Scenario Writers Association taking a non-cooperative attitude toward film production on the Toho Company side.

The full-scale performance that issued the strike order on June 2, but was canceled on June 3 until June 16. On the other hand, Nikkei, which has led the dispute, applied to the Tokyo District Court for provisional disposition of dismissal invalid status protection on June 25, and on August 10, a recommendation was issued by the Tokyo District Court and the memorandum of understanding was made at the Tokyo District Court on May 28. On December 29, a tentative signing was made at the Japanese company, ending the dispute. Kinuta Productions, which produced the feature film "Haha Nareba Onna", directed by Fumio Kamei and starring Isuzu Yamada in 1952, was paid to Nikkei for the settlement of the 4th Toho Dispute. Of course it is said that it was established with a capital of ¥2 million.

In January 1967, 16 year old high school student Ai Takano left the Freelancers (フリーランサーズ, "Furīransāzu"), a vocal group he had belonged to, and immediately invited former Swing West rhythm guitarist Jiro Kitamura and his fellow member of Freelancers Hiroshi Koshikawa to form a new band. Koshikawa was in Nagoya. Keikichi Usui, who has been an ally since the jazz cafe "Grand Canyon" era, and Tadao Oka, who was also a member of the Sounds West in Nagoya, were welcomed and they were patronizing the restaurant in Kamata, Ota-ku. With the full backing of former bandman Masahiro Miike, who is the owner of "80", he started his career under the name of Robin Hood (ロビンフッド, "Robin fuddo").

Eventually, the group passed the audition held at JVC, the publisher of Philips Records. The original single "I Love You" (released in 1965) by the British band The Zombies played at this time was successfully arranged by them, and producer Kazushi Honjo immediately translated the English-American pop songs. They asked Kenji Sazanami, a songwriter and lyricist, to translate it into Japanese, and their first debut single "Sukisa Sukisa Sukisa" (好きさ好きさ好きさ, "I Love You I Love I Love You") became a popular hit.

At the time of their first music debut, they changed their name to The Carnabeats by Rumiko Hoshika, the editor-in-chief of Music Life, and the agency will be Robin's Plan, which would later be launched for them. In June 1967, The Carnabeats made another album with The Jaguars, who belongs to the same recording company as an idol of the catchphrase, The Carnabeat's Sound Age. In their first debut single "Sukisa Sukisa Sukisa" Takano, who sings very passionately, sticks out his drumsticks and screams "All of you", which captivates female fans and immediately the song became a massive success.

With the popularity of other electric bands such as The Spiders, The Tigers, The Blue Comets, and The Jaguars, who had already debuted their albums, the song blockbuster was one of the catalysts for the GS boom. Takano's singing voice grabbed the hearts of the fans and the group had release another hit single "Let's Love Jenny", released in September 1967. In addition, Usui, who was in charge of Japanese translation from the recommendation of Rumiko Hoshika, sings energeticly in "You Are Crazy About You" on side B. The groups's third single released in October is "Okay!", which is a cover song of Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich, and Paul Anka's hit song "Crazy Love" on the B side. By using the fuzz audio, it is finished in an arrangement like The Carnabeats did so. The band produced many rock-like sound with Kitamura and all the members feeling close to Western rock'n roll music.

They showed a different look with a another song, "Don't Cry", released in February 1968. This album is a ballad by the combination of two songwriters Jun Hashimoto and Koichi Sugiyama, and it is a song that mixes the sadly singing Takano and the chorus members. Ten days later, they released "Cutie Morning Moon," which was recorded with British musician Gary Walker, a drummer of The Walker Brothers (UK), who was as popular as The Beatles in Japan. This song was written by Scott Walker, and the performance and chorus were recorded from the night of January 9, when the recording was made, to the dawn. The song title was decided to change from "The Shadow Of The Moon That Remains Faintly In The Sky" to "Cutie Morning Moon", and the composition was composed by producer Honjo, the composer of "Let's love Jenny". It was also put in charge under the name of Rinji Motoo.

Their sixth single "Love In Search", released in May was the first solo for Usui on side A, and was written by Kōhan Kawauchi, who is known as the original creator of "Moonlight Mask", and this song was written by The Spiders. They brought it to Victor Records, but it went to The Carnabeats, which belongs to the same music distributor, Philips Records. This year, the band participated in the Nikkei Western Carnival in as guest performances, appeared in multiple movies and tv shows, released the LP "The Carnabeats First Album", acted as an image character for Fujiya and Pepsi Cola commercials, and their tour from June in Tokyo and Osaka. Their strong performance such as holding a one-man show continued, and their single "Um Um Um" was released in August.

However, the GS boom peaked in 1968 and began to died down with upcoming rhythm and blues, hard and soft rock, funk, and disco during the early 1970s. The next single "My Baby" was released in October, and even with Takano's singing reminiscent of the early singles, it did not become a hit. On March 1969, the Beatles' "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da", which is famous for its marmalade rhythm, was released with the translation of Kenji Sazanami for the first time. However, in April, vocalist Usui left the group, and Paul Okada, who was in another GS, joined them. The song they released was "Teltel Heaven".

In contrast to the A-side, which is a cover song, the B-side, with the Latin song "Midnight Lovers" composed by Takashi Miki, tried to revive with a sound that was ahead of the trend, but the decline of the GS boom could not be stopped anymore, and the same year. Kitamura and Oka left the group in September, and Kyoichi Saiga and Rie joined, but they eventually disbanded. After the band ended, Ai Takano joined The Golden Cups as a drummer in January 1970.
