Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (; born October 13, 1989), also known by her initials as AOC, is an American politician and activist. She became the U.S. Representative for New York's 14th congressional district in 2019. This includes the eastern part of the Bronx and parts of north-central Queens in New York City. She is a member of the Democratic Party.

Ocasio-Cortez won the Democratic Party's primary election on June 26, 2018, when she beat Democratic Caucus Chair Joe Crowley. Her victory was a surprise and many saw it as an upset victory. In November 2018, she would go on to win the general election. She beat Republican nominee Anthony Pappas.

At age 29, she became the youngest woman to become a member of the United States Congress. She is well known for her use of social media. She studied international relations and economics at Boston University. She worked for Bernie Sanders's first presidential campaign as an activist. She also worked part-time as a waitress and bartender before running for Congress in 2018.

Ocasio-Cortez is one of the first female members of the Democratic Socialists of America elected to Congress. She is a democratic socialist and a progressive. She supports Medicare for All, federal jobs guarantee, a universal basic income, and the Green New Deal. She also supports ending the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, free public college and trade school, and a 70% marginal tax rate for incomes above $10 million.

Ocasio-Cortez was born into a Catholic family in the Bronx borough of New York City on October 13, 1989. She is the daughter of Blanca Ocasio-Cortez ("née" Cortez) and Sergio Ocasio. She has a younger brother named Gabriel. Her father was born in the Bronx to a Puerto Rican family. Her mother was born in Puerto Rico. She lived with her family in an apartment in the Bronx neighborhood of Parkchester until she was five. Her family later moved to a house in suburban Yorktown Heights.

Ocasio-Cortez went to high school in Yorktown Heights. She graduated in 2007. In high school and college, she was known as "Sandy." She came in second in the Microbiology category of the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. Her microbiology research project was about the effect of antioxidants on the lifespan of the nematode "C. elegans". MIT Lincoln Laboratory named a small asteroid after her because of her science project. In high school, she took part in the National Hispanic Institute's Lorenzo de Zavala (LDZ) Youth Legislative Session. She later became the LDZ Secretary of State while she attended Boston University. Ocasio-Cortez had a John F. Lopez Fellowship.

In 2008, while Ocasio-Cortez was a sophomore at Boston University, her father died of lung cancer. After he died, Ocasio-Cortez had many legal problems to settle his estate. She has said that the experience helped her learn how attorneys are corrupt. She said that they make themselves rich while their clients, like families, were being ignored.

During college, Ocasio-Cortez was an intern for U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy. She said that she was the only Spanish speaker at the office. Ocasio-Cortez said that because of this, people would talk to her about ICE and deportations.

Ocasio-Cortez graduated "cum laude" from Boston University with a BA in 2011. She majored in international relations and economics.

After college, Ocasio-Cortez moved back to the Bronx. She began working as a bartender and waitress to help her mother pay for their home. She later created Brook Avenue Press, a publishing company that printed positive stories about the Bronx. She also worked for the National Hispanic Institute.

During the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, Ocasio-Cortez volunteered for Bernie Sanders's first presidential campaign. After the general election, she traveled to places like Flint, Michigan, and Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota by car. She spoke to people affected by the Flint water crisis and the Dakota Access Pipeline. While in Standing Rock, she said her trip there was an important reason why she ran for Congress. Before that, she believed that the only way to run for office and win was to have money and power. In North Dakota she saw others "putting their whole lives and everything that they had on the line for the protection of their community". This was the reason for her to begin to work for her own community. One day after she visited North Dakota, she got a phone call from Brand New Congress. They were looking for progressive candidates. Her brother had nominated her soon after the 2016 election.

Ocasio-Cortez began her campaign in April 2017. At the time, she was working at Flats Fix, a taco restaurant in New York City's Union Square. Her campaign was small. She was the first person to run in the primary against Joe Crowley, the Democratic Caucus Chair. She did not have much money for the campaign. She said that candidates like here must have very new and different kinds of campaigns and cannot win just by spending more money Ocasio-Cortez's campaign did not take money from big companies or rich people. She did this because it was how Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign did it. Revolutionary posters from the past inspired her campaign posters.

Ocasio-Cortez was supported by progressive and civil rights groups such as MoveOn, Black Lives Matter, and Democracy for America, and by actress Cynthia Nixon. Governor Andrew Cuomo, both of New York's U.S. Senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Planned Parenthood supported Crowley. California Representative Ro Khanna at first supported Crowley, but later supported Ocasio-Cortez.

During her campaign, Ocasio-Cortez held town halls where people who lived in her congressional district would talk about political issues. She focused her campaign on Latino communities of her district and criticized ICE. Her campaign used digital political ads more than actual rallies and events. She would also go to many houses in her district and talk about her campaign in person.

On June 26, 2018, Ocasio-Cortez won 57.13% of the vote to Joe Crowley's 42.5%. "Time" called her victory a big surprise during the 2018 elections. CNN made a similar comment. "The New York Times" said Crowley's shocking loss was "the [biggest] loss for a Democratic incumbent in more than a decade." "The Guardian" called it "one of the biggest upsets in recent American political history." Crowley raised more money, $1.5 million, compared to Ocasio-Cortez's $83,000. Merriam-Webster said that searches for the word "socialism" went up 1,500% after she won. Crowley accepted his loss but did not call Ocasio-Cortez that night to wish her good luck. Many people thought he was going to run against her in the general election with a third party.

Bernie Sanders and Noam Chomsky wished her good luck and were happy about the results. Many people said that her victory over Crowley was like when Dave Brat, a Tea Party movement candidate, beat House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the Republican primary in 2014. Cantor was also a longtime congressman and important Republican politician. After her primary win, Ocasio-Cortez supported many progressive candidates who decided to run against current Democratic politicians across the country.

Ocasio-Cortez won the Reform Party nomination without campaigning for it. She won it as a write-in candidate in a congressional district nearby hers. She won only nine votes. She did not accept the nomination.

Ocasio-Cortez ran against Republican nominee Anthony Pappas in the November 6 general election. Pappas is an economics professor at St. John's University. Ocasio-Cortez was supported by many progressive organizations and politicians, including former President Barack Obama and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders.

Joe Crowley stayed on the ballot, as the nominee of the Working Families Party (WFP) and the Women’s Equality Party (WEP). Neither Crowley nor the WFP party campaigned in the election. Both supported Ocasio-Cortez after her Democratic primary victory. Ocasio-Cortez said that the WEP was a centrist group that supported male politicians more than female politicians. Nixon ran against Governor Cuomo in the primary for New York Governor. Former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman wanted Crowley to campaign on the WFP ballot to beat Ocasio-Cortez. Dan Cantor, executive director of the WFP, asked voters not to vote for Crowley if his name was on the general election ballot.

Ocasio-Cortez won the election with 78% of the vote to Pappas' 14%. Crowley, on the WFP and WEP ballots, won 6.6% of the votes. Her election was part of a larger wave of Democratic victories in the 2018 midterm elections. The party won control of the United States House of Representatives.

"The Young Turks" (TYT) was the first media network who talked about Ocasio-Cortez and give her time to talk about her campaign. After her primary win, she quickly had media attention from everywhere in the country. A rally with Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders in Wichita had to be moved from a theater with a seating capacity of 1,500 when more people said they would go to the rally. 4,000 people went to the event, with some sitting on the floor. "The New Yorker" wrote that she had made Sanders's progressive ideas more popular to a larger group of people.

Ocasio-Cortez had little media attention until she beat incumbent Joe Crowley in the 2018 Democratic primary. Many people believed the media did a bad job on covering the election because no one paid attention to her primary campaign.

"The Young Turks" has defended Ocasio-Cortez from political critics.

She was one of the people talked about in the 2018 Michael Moore documentary "Fahrenheit 11/9".

Twitter user "AnonymousQ" tried to embarrass Ocasio-Cortez when they shared a video of her dancing during her college years. Many social media users defended her, and the video inspired memes. After the video was shared, Ocasio-Cortez posted a video of herself dancing to Edwin Starr's "War".

In 2019, Elizabeth Warren wrote about Ocasio-Cortez for that year's "Time" 100. In May 2019 the documentary "Knock Down the House" came out on Netflix. It is about four female Democrats, without political experience, running for Congress in the 2018 midterms premiered. Ocasio-Cortez was the only one of the women in the documentary to win their election.

In September 2021, Ocasio-Cortez went to the 2021 Met Gala. Ocasio-Cortez wore a long white dress with the phrase "Tax the Rich" painted in red on the back of her dress. As an elected official in New York City, she was a guest of the museum and she did not have to buy a ticket, which costs at least $35,000. Many people, both conservative and liberal, criticized Ocasio-Cortez for attending an event where guests were not required to wear masks.

In 2020, journalist Michelle Caruso-Cabrera ran against Ocasio-Cortez in the Democratic primary. After Ocasio-Cortez won the nomination, Caruso-Cabrera ran in the general election as a third-party candidate.

She began her career with a popular social media, having more followers than all of the newly elected congress members combined. , she had 6.3 million Twitter followers, up from 1.4 million in November 2018. She passed Nancy Pelosi's number of followers. By July 2019 that had risen to almost 4.8 million, or about seven times the population of her congressional district. She had 2.2 million Instagram followers, and 500,000 followers on Facebook when she began. Some Representatives asked her to teach them social media lessons when she arrived in Congress.

In an interview Ocasio-Cortez said she had stopped using her private Facebook account and was not using all of her social media accounts as often. She believes that social media is not healthy for the public.

Ocasio-Cortez is a member a group of new progressive members of Congress called "The Squad" along with Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). In July 2019, President Donald Trump attacked the Squad in a tweet, saying that they should "go back and help fix" the countries they came from instead of criticizing the American government. Ocasio-Cortez replied that "the President's words [yesterday], telling four American Congresswomen of color "go back to your own country," is [the] language of white supremacists. We don't leave the things that we love, and when we love this country, what that means is that we [find] the solutions to fix it."

Trump falsely said that she called "our country and our people 'garbage'"; she had actually said that Americans should not be happy with average ideas that are "10% better from garbage." Trump also falsely claimed that she said "illegal immigrants are more American" than Americans who tried to keep them out. She actually said that "women and children on that border that are trying to [find] refuge and opportunity" in America "are acting more American" than those who tried to keep them out.

Also that month, she supported Pelosi becoming Speaker of the House. She said would support Pelosi if Pelosi "remains the most progressive candidate for speaker." She also said that all the other candidates for speaker were more conservative than Pelosi was. Pelosi was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives after the Democratic Party gained the majority.

In December 2018, Ocasio-Cortez went to an event for new members of the House hosted by the John F. Kennedy School of Government. She wrote on Twitter about the effects of business interests by groups such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Center for Strategic and International Studies: "Lobbyists are here. Goldman Sachs is here. Where's labor? Activists? community leaders?"

In January 2019, when she made her first speech on the floor of Congress, C-SPAN tweeted the video. Within 12 hours, the video of her four-minute speech set the record as C-SPAN's most-watched Twitter video by a member of the House of Representatives.

She said that no laws that stop politicians from taking money from rich business people. With more than 37.5 million views, the clip became the most-watched political video posted on Twitter.

When President Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen was at a Congressional hearing in February 2019, Ocasio-Cortez asked him if Trump rose property values for bank or insurance purposes. Cohen said that Trump may have done tax evasion and fraud in his personal and business tax returns and real-estate documents. "The New York Times" supported her because she asked specific questions for a specific answer.

According to reports in March 2019, Ocasio-Cortez continued to get media coverage early in her congressional career similar to a 2020 presidential candidate. She was called one of the best known Democratic politicians and one of the most talked-about politicians in the United States. Between July 8 and July 14, 2019, she had more social media attention than any of the Democratic presidential candidates, with news articles on Ocasio-Cortez had 4.8 million views, while no Democratic presidential candidate got more than 1.2 million.

Ocasio-Cortez has been talked about many times on Fox News, being mentioned every day from February 25 to April 7, 2019, for a total of 3,181 mentions in 42 days. CNN found that from January to July 2019, she had nearly three times as many mentions on Fox News as on CNN and MSNBC. In a CBS News poll of almost 2,100 people found that more Republicans talked about Ocasio-Cortez than Democrats. She was very unpopular among Republicans and very popular among Democrats.

In March 2019, "PolitiFact" reported that she is "one of the most targeted politicians for hoax claims, despite the fact that she just entered Congress as a freshman." Fake quotes, fake photos, and false rumors about her have spread on social media.

On July 18, 2019, Charlie Rispoli, a police officer from Gretna, posted on Facebook a threat to shoot her. He called her an "idiot" who "needs a round, and I don't mean the kind she used to serve" as a bartender. Rispoli posted the comment in response to a "fake news" article that falsely quoted Ocasio-Cortez as saying "We pay soldiers too much." Rispoli was fired for his post and his Facebook account was deleted.

On February 7, 2019, Ocasio-Cortez wrote her first piece of legislation, the Green New Deal, and sent it to the Senate. Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts supported the deal, laying out the main ideas of a 10-year economic plan that would slowly remove fossil fuel use. The plan would create jobs and boost the economy. The first version of the Green New Deal wanted the completely stop using fossil fuels. The plan set a goal of having the United States "creating 'net-zero' greenhouse gases in 10 years." Ocasio-Cortez said that "We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast."

Ocasio-Cortez wanted a marginal tax as high as 70% on income above $10 million to pay for the Green New Deal. Tax experts said in "The Washington Post", that this tax would bring in more money of $720 billion every ten years. She used the Modern Monetary Theory as a reason for higher deficits to pay her agenda. She said that the Green New Deal needs a large amount of money like President Franklin D. Roosevelt's original New Deal during the Great Depression.

Not one Republican supported the Green New Deal. The plan had support from some Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker. Other Democrats, such as Senator Dianne Feinstein and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not support it. Pelosi called it "the green dream, or whatever they call it."

On March 26, Senate Republicans called for an early vote on the Green New Deal without letting anyone talk before the vote. Senator Ed Markey said Republicans were not being serious about voting for the Green New Deal. In protest, Senate Democrats voted "present" or against the bill, resulting in a 57–0 defeat on the Senate floor. In March 2019, a group of activists, inspired by Ocasio-Cortez, in the United Kingdom wanted the Labour Party to create a similar plan, "Labour for a Green New Deal."

In May 2020, Ocasio-Cortez was picked by then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to be in charge of his climate task force. Ocasio-Cortez would help Biden's campaign talk about climate change related problems and solutions.

On July 21, 2020, Republican Representatives Ted Yoho and Roger Williams had angrily yelled at Ocasio-Cortez on the steps of the Capitol. Yoho called her "disgusting" and told her, "You are out of your freaking mind". They were mad at Ocasio-Cortez after she said that poverty and unemployment were the reasons for an increase in crime in New York City during the coronavirus pandemic. Ocasio-Cortez told Yoho he was being "rude". A reporter who heard the conversation said that as Ocasio-Cortez walked away from Yoho into the Capitol, Yoho called her a "fucking bitch".

When asked about the incident, Ocasio-Cortez said, "That kind of [event] hasn't ever happened to me ever... I've never had that kind of abrupt, disgusting kind of disrespect [aimed] at me". Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy did not support Yoho's actions and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said that Yoho should apologize publicly.

On July 22, Yoho talked about the event on the House floor and, without naming Ocasio-Cortez, said he had not addressed the "offensive name-calling words" to any congress members directly. He apologized for the conversation and said "having been married for 45 years with two daughters, I'm very [careful] of my language".

On July 23, Ocasio-Cortez responded to Yoho's comments. In a speech she criticized male privilege, sexist behavior and culture, and violent language against women. She also criticized Yoho for "hiding behind his wife and daughters" in his speech the day before.

In early August 2020, two weeks before the 2020 Democratic National Convention was to be held, people began to say that Democrats were not going to let Ocasio-Cortez speak at the convention. On August 10, the Democratic National Committee said that she would speak at the convention on the second day on August 18. The same day, she formally nominated Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination.

In November 2021, Representative Paul Gosar shared a video parody of the opening for the anime series "Attack on Titan" on social media. He had edited with the faces of Ocasio-Cortez, Joe Biden, and himself on the show's characters, showing Gosar attacking them with swords and killing Ocasio-Cortez. Speaker Nancy Pelosi wanted the U.S. House to investigate it as a threat. Pelosi said that the video is "a danger that it represents to everyone in the country".

When Republican House members did not want to criticize Gosar or the video, Ocasio-Cortez said that she believed the video was "part of a pattern that normalizes violence". She gave a six-minute floor speech, saying, "This is not about me. This is not about Representative Gosar. This is about what we're willing to accept". The House voted to censure Gosar, in doing so it became the first time the House censured a Representative since 2010.

In 1923, the LNWR became a part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) under the Railways Act 1921. In 1948, it became the London Midland Region of British Railways. The LNWR may be seen as an ancestor of today's West Coast Main Line.

Midland Railway

The Midland Railway (MR) was a railway company in the United Kingdom from 1844 to 1922. It had a large network of lines managed from its headquarters in Derby. It became the third-largest railway undertaking in the British Isles after the Great Western Railway and the London and North Western Railway.

The company was formed in 1844 by the merger of the Midland Counties Railway, the North Midland Railway, and the Birmingham & Derby Junction Railway. The Birmingham & Gloucester Railway joined two years later. The earlier systems met at Derby railway station. The MR established its locomotive works, and later its carriage and wagon works, at Derby.

In 1923, the MR became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway under the Railways Act 1921.

The Turk

The Turk, also known as the Mechanical Turk or Automaton Chess Player was a trick chess-playing machine. First put on show in 1770, the machine was in use until it was destroyed in a fire in 1854. It was later found to be a hoax. It was built in 1770 by Wolfgang von Kempelen to impress the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. The machine could play chess against a human. It could also perform the knight's tour, a puzzle where a player moves a knight to every square of a chessboard exactly once.

The Turk was not a real machine, but a mechanical illusion. There was a person inside the machine working the controls. With a skilled chess player hidden inside the box, the Turk won most of the games. It played and won games against many people including Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin. The chess players who secretly worked inside the box included Johann Allgaier, Hyacinthe Henri Boncourt, Aaron Alexandre, William Lewis, Jacques Mouret, and William Schlumberger.

The machine had a life-sized model of a human head and body, placed next to a large wooden box. The model was dressed in Ottoman robes and wore a turban. Its left arm held a long smoking pipe. The large box was about three-and-a-half feet (110 cm) long, two feet (60 cm) wide, and two-and-a-half feet (75 cm) high. On the top of the box was a chessboard, about 18 inches square. The front of the box had three doors, an opening, and a drawer. Inside the drawer was a red and white ivory chess set.

The inside of the box was very complicated. It was meant to trick those who looked into it. When the left front doors were opened you could see clockwork gears and cogs. If the back doors of the box were open at the same time you could see through the machine. The other side of the box contained a red cushion and some removable parts. This area also gave a clear view through the machine. Under the robes of the Turk were two more doors. When these were opened you could also see the clockwork parts with a view right through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every door to the public, to keep the illusion.

However the clockwork parts on the left side and the drawer did not go back as far as the back of the box. They only went one third of the way. This gave room for a sliding seat, so the person inside was able to slide from place to place. This meant they were not seen when the doors were opened. Moving the seat caused fake machinery to slide into its place to further hide the person inside the box.

The chessboard on the top of the box was thin. This allowed for a magnetic linkage. Each piece in the chess set had a small, strong magnet joined to its base. When placed on the board the pieces would attract a magnet attached to a string under their places on the board. The person inside the machine could see which pieces moved where on the chess board. The bottom of the chessboard was also numbered, 1–64, allowing the person to see which places on the board were affected by a player's move. The magnets were placed so that they were not affected by any magnets outside the box. Kempelen would let people from the audience put a large magnet next to the board to show that the machine was not influenced by magnetism.

To distract the audience, the Turk came with a small wooden box. This would be put on the top of the box. Kempelen would look into into the small box during play, suggesting that it controlled the machine. The box was believed by some to have magic powers.

Inside the box was a chess board connected to a series of levers. These controlled the model's left arm and could move it around the chess board. The arm could be moved up and down, and turning the lever would open and close the Turk's hand. This let it pick up the chess pieces on the board. The machinery made a clockwork-type sound when the Turk made a move, further adding to the machinery illusion. The levers also made the Turk make various facial expressions. A voice box was added later, allowing the machine to say "Échec!" (French for "check") during matches.

The person inside and the presenter on the outside could send messages to each other. There were two brass discs with numbers on the inside and outside of the box. The discs could be turned to a number which acted as a code between the two.

The first display of the Turk was in 1770 at Schönbrunn Palace. Kempelen showed everyone what he had built. He opened the doors and drawers of the cabinet, so the audience could look into the machine. It was then ready for a game.

The Turk would use the white pieces and have the first move. Between moves its left arm sat on a cushion. The Turk could nod twice if it threatened the other player's queen, and three times upon placing the king in check. If the other player made an illegal move, the Turk would shake its head, move the piece back. The first person to play against the Turk was Count Ludwig von Cobenzl, an Austrian courtier at the palace. He was quickly defeated.

Another part of the show was the knight's tour, a famed chess puzzle. The puzzle requires the player to move a knight around a chessboard, touching each square once along the way. While most experienced chess players of the time still struggled with the puzzle, the Turk was able to make the moves easily. The person inside had a map of moves needed.

The Turk could also communicate with the audience using a letter board. It was able to do this in English, French, and German. Carl Friedrich Hindenburg, a university mathematician, wrote down the conversations during the Turk's time in Leipzig and published it in 1789 as "Über den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen und dessen Nachbildung" (or "On the Chessplayer of Mr. von Kempelen And Its Replica"). Questions included the Turk's age, marital status, and its secret workings.

Interest in the machine grew across Europe. Kempelen, however, was more interested in his other projects and did not want to show the Turk. He would tell people it was not working.  After the performances at the Schönbrunn Palace the Turk only played Sir Robert Murray Keith, a Scottish noble. Kempelen took the machine to pieces after the match. Kempelen said the machine was a "mere bagatelle". He was not pleased with its popularity and would rather continue his work on steam engines and machines that could speak.

In 1781, Kempelen was ordered by Emperor Joseph II to rebuild the Turk and take it to Vienna for a state visit from Grand Duke Paul of Russia. This was so successful that Grand Duke Paul suggested a tour of Europe for the Turk. Kempelen reluctantly agreed.

The tour began in 1783, beginning in France. In Paris,  the Turk lost a match to Charles Godefroy de La Tour d'Auvergne, the Duc de Bouillon. People wanted the Turk to play a game with François-André Danican Philidor, the best chess player of his time. Philidor won, but it was "his most fatiguing game of chess ever!" The Turk's final game in Paris was against Benjamin Franklin, the United State's ambassador to France. Franklin enjoyed the game with the Turk and kept a copy of Philip Thicknesse's book "The Speaking Figure and the Automaton Chess Player, Exposed and Detected" in his personal library.

After Paris, Kempelen moved the Turk to London, where it was on show every day at a cost of five shillings. Thicknesse, a skeptic, tried to explain that the machine was just a trick. He said Kempelen was "a very ingenious man", but the Turk was an elaborate hoax. He thought there was a small child inside the machine. The Turk was "a complicated piece of clockwork ... which is nothing more, than one, of many other ingenious devices, to misguide and delude the observers".

After a year in London, Kempelen and the Turk went to Leipzig, Dresden, and Amsterdam. After that the machine was probably stored at the Schönbrunn Palace for 20 years. Kempelen did try to sell it before his death. He died at the age of 70 on 26 March 1804.

In 1805 Kempelen's son sold the machine to Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a Bavarian musician interested in machines and devices. Mälzel had designed a type of metronome. He had tried to purchase the Turk before Kempelen's death but the price was too high. Mälzel had to learn how the machine worked and make some repairs. He wanted to make the Turk a greater challenge. 

In 1809, Napoleon I of France arrived at Schönbrunn Palace to play the Turk. Before the game, the Turk, with Johann Baptist Allgaier hidden inside, saluted Napoleon. In a surprise move, Napoleon took the first turn instead of allowing the Turk to make the first move. When Napoleon attempted an illegal move, the Turk put the piece back in its original spot and continued the game. After a second illegal move the Turk took the piece from the board. When Napoleon tried a third illegal move the Turk swept its arm across, knocking all the pieces off the board. Napoleon was amused, and then played a real game with the machine. After 19 moves Napoleon pushed over his king to show that he knew he could not win, and was giving up. 

In 1811, Mälzel took the Turk to Milan to show Eugène de Beauharnais, the Prince of Venice and Viceroy of Italy. Beauharnais liked it so much, that he bought the Turk for 30,000 francs – three times what Mälzel had paid – and kept it for four years. In 1815, Mälzel went to Beauharnais in Munich and bought the Turk back. 

Mälzel took the Turk back to Paris where he made friends of many of the leading chess players at Café de la Régence. In 1818 he moved to London and held a number of performances with the Turk and many of his other machines. He added a voice box so the machine could say "Échec!" when placing a player in check.

In 1826, Mälzel took the machine to New York City. Mälzel had problems finding people to operate the machine.  He ended up bringing William Schlumberger, from Alsace in Europe to come to America and work for him once again. Mälzel had to provide the money for Schlumberger's transport.

In Boston, Mälzel told a story that the New York chess players could not handle full games and that the Boston players were much better. This was a success for many weeks, and the tour moved to Philadelphia for three months. In Baltimore, it lost a match against Charles Carroll, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Two American brothers built their own machine, the Walker Chess-player. Mälzel tried to buy it, but they would not sell it. This second machine toured for a number of years, but was never as famous as the Turk.

Between 1828, Mälzel visited Europe, returning to the States in 1829. In the 1830s, went as far west as the Mississippi River and visiting Canada. In Richmond, Virginia, Edgar Allan Poe, wrote about the Turk for the "Southern Literary Messenger". Poe's essay "Maelzel's Chess Player" was published in April 1836 and is the most famous essay on the Turk.

Mälzel took the Turk on his second tour to Havana, Cuba. In Cuba, Schlumberger died of yellow fever, leaving Mälzel without an operator. Mälzel died at sea in 1838 at the age of 66 during his return trip, leaving his machine with the ship captain.

The Turk was given to a friend of Mälzel's, the businessman John Ohl. He tried to sell it at auction but ended up buying it himself for $400. John Kearsley Mitchell, Edgar Allan Poe's doctor, bought the Turk from Ohl. Mitchell formed a club to fix it, completing the rebuilding in 1840.

Mitchell and his club gave the machine to the Chinese Museum of Charles Willson Peale. After a few shows it was put into a corner and forgotten. On 5 July 1854, a fire that started at the National Theater in Philadelphia reached the Museum and destroyed the Turk. Mitchell believed he had heard "through the struggling flames ... the last words of our departed friend, the sternly whispered, oft repeated syllables, 'echec! echec!!'

John Gaughan, an American in Los Angeles who made items for magicians, spent $120,000 building a copy of Kempelen's machine over a five-year period from 1984. The new machine used the Turk's chessboard, which was saved from the fire. Gaughan's Turk was displayed in November 1989 at a history of magic conference. This time, the Turk played against a computer running a chess program.

Most books and articles written during the Turk's life about how it worked were incorrect. 

It was not until Dr. Silas Mitchell's series of articles for "The Chess Monthly" that the secret was fully revealed. Mitchell, son of the final owner of the Turk, wrote that "no secret was ever kept as the Turk's has been. Guessed at, in part, many times, no one of the several explanations ... ever solved this amusing puzzle". As the Turk had been destroyed, Silas Mitchell felt that there were "no longer any reasons for concealing from the amateurs of chess, the solution to this ancient enigma".

New interest began in the Turk when IBM created Deep Blue. This was a computer that could challenge the world's best players. The Turk was used as a personification of Deep Blue in the 2003 documentary "Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine".

The Turk inspired a number of inventions and copies. These included the Ajeeb, or "The Egyptian", built by Charles Hopper that President Grover Cleveland played in 1885; and Mephisto, the self-described "most famous" machine, of which little is known. The Walkers made the "American Chess Player" first shown in May 1827 in New York. El Ajedrecista was built in 1912 by Leonardo Torres y Quevedo and first shown at the Paris World Fair of 1914. It was the first true chess-playing automaton, and a precursor of sorts to Deep Blue.

Other people were inspired by the Turk. The Rev. Edmund Cartwright saw it in London in 1784. He later wrote "it is more difficult to construct a machine that shall weave than one which shall make all the variety of moves required in that complicated game". Cartwright would later invent the power loom. Sir Charles Wheatstone, an inventor, saw the Turk while it was owned by Mälzel. Mälzel later showed his speaking machines to the researcher and his teenage son. Alexander Graham Bell read a copy of a book by Wolfgang von Kempelen on speaking machines after seeing a similar machine built by Wheatstone. Bell went on to invent the telephone.

A play, "The Automaton Chess Player", was performed in New York City in 1845. The play used a copy of the Turk made by J. Walker, who had earlier built the Walker Chess-player.

Raymond Bernard's silent movie, "The Chess Player" ("The Chess Player", France 1927), uses the story of the Turk in an adventure tale set during the Partitions of Poland in 1772. A Polish nationalist escaping from the  Russians, also happens to be an expert chess player. He is hidden inside a chess playing automaton called the Turk. Just as he is about to escape over the border, the machine is taken to Saint Petersburg for the empress Catherine II. Copying the Napoleon incident, Catherine attempts to cheat the Turk, who sweeps all the pieces from the board.

The Turk has been used novels and stories: 

In 2005, Amazon.com launched the Amazon Mechanical Turk. The program is designed to have humans perform tasks with which computers struggle, such as color comparisons.

Wolfgang von Kempelen

Wolfgang von Kempelen (; 23 January 1734 – 26 March 1804) was a Hungarian author and inventor. He is known for his chess-playing "automaton" hoax, The Turk, and for his speaking machine.

Von Kempelen was born in Pressburg, part of the Kingdom of Hungary. He was the last child of Engelbert Kempelen (1680–1761), and Anna Theresa Spindler. 

He studied law and philosophy in Pressburg, and attended the Academy in Győr, Vienna and Rome. He was interested in mathematics and physics. He spoke German, Hungarian, Latin, French, Italian. Later, during his travels he learned English and Romanian. His first job was in 1755 as a clerk in the Hungarian Court Chamber in Pozsony. Later he became a secretary (1757), a Councillor of the Court Chamber (1764), Director of Salt Mining (1765), Second Commissioner of the Constitutional Commission for the Region of Banat (1769), and finally Imperial-Royal Court Councillor (1787). He also helped move the University of Nagyszombat to Buda Castle, and looked after the building of the Court Theatre in Buda's old Carmelite monastery.

He married twice, first in 1757 to Maria Franziska Piani, who died in 1758, and again in 1762 to Maria Anna von Gobelius. Five children were born from his second marriage, of whom two survived into adulthood: Maria Theresia (1768–1812) and Karl (1771–1822).

Von Kempelen was most famous for his construction of The Turk, a chess-playing automaton presented to Maria Theresa of Austria in 1769. The machine had a life-sized model of a human head and body, dressed in Turkish robes and wearing a turban. It was seated behind a large wooden box on with a chessboard on the top. The machine could play a game of chess against a human opponent. But it was a trick. There was a person, a skilled chess player, hidden inside the box. The Turk was a really a puppet, worked from below by levers. The Turk won most of the games played during its shows around Europe and the Americas for nearly 84 years. It played and defeated many people including Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin.

Kempelen also built a speaking machine. One of them can still be seen in the Musical Instruments section of the Deutsches Museum in Munich. In 1789, he published a book of his 20 years of speech research, "Mechanismus Der Menschlichen Sprache Nebst Beschreibung Seiner Sprechenden Maschine".

He also built steam-engines, waterpumps, a pontoon bridge in Pressburg (1770), patented a steam turbine for mills (1788/89) and a typewriter for the blind Viennese pianist Maria Theresia von Paradis (1779), and built a theatre house in Buda opened on 25 October 1790 (now Budapest) and the famous fountains at Schönbrunn in Vienna (1780). He was also an artist, wrote poems and epigrams, and composed a "singspiel", "Andromeda and Perseus", performed in Vienna.

He retired in 1798, after 43 years of service to the Austrian Empire. In 1771, Maria Theresia gave von Kempelen an annual pension of 1,000 ducats. After her death, her son Joseph II cut the pensions given to the court's civil servants. In 1802, he tried to get his pension back from Francis II, and also asked for compensation of 20,000 Gulden, but was not granted.

At the time of his death in 1804, he owned a country estate in Gomba near Pozsony, but died in his apartment in Alser, a suburb of Vienna.

The Wolfgang von Kempelen Computing Science History Prize was named in his honor, as was a high school in Budapest.




Meadowbank Stadium

Meadowbank Stadium (Meadowbank Sports Centre) is a multi-purpose sports facility in Edinburgh, Scotland. It was originally built to host the 1970 Commonwealth Games. It also hosted the Games in 1986, the first venue to host the Games twice.

The stadium is the home ground of Scottish Football League team Meadowbank Thistle. The Meadowbank complex also hosts Leith Athletic, who play on the Meadowbank artificial pitch next to the main stadium. Meadowbank Stadium was also used for rugby union as the home venue of Edinburgh Rugby between 2002 and 2004.

As of 2017, the stadium is being redeveloped.

Knight's tour

A knight's tour is a set of moves of a knight on a chessboard. The knight visits every square only once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is "closed", otherwise it is "open".

The knight's tour problem is the mathematical problem of finding a knight's tour. Making a program to find a knight's tour is a common problem given to computer science students. Variations of the knight's tour problem involve chessboards of different sizes than the usual , as well as irregular (non-rectangular) boards.

Derby railway station

Derby railway station, also known as Derby Midland, is a main line station serving the city of Derby in England. It is owned by Network Rail and managed by East Midlands Trains. The station is also used by CrossCountry services and one daily Northern service.

It lies north of London St Pancras. It is situated to the south-east of Derby city centre, and is close to the west bank of the River Derwent.

Northern (train operating company)

Northern, was the trading name of Arriva Rail North. It was a train operating company in Northern England. It was a subsidiary of Arriva UK Trains. It operated the Northern franchise from 1 April 2016 to February 2020 and inherited trains from the previous operator Northern Rail.

Great Central Railway

The Great Central Railway (GCR) of England was created in 1897 when the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway changed its name. In 1899, the GCR opened its London Extension to a new terminus at Marylebone station.

On 1 January 1923, the company became part of the London and North Eastern Railway under the Railways Act 1921.

London and South Western Railway

The London and South Western Railway (LSWR) was a railway company in England from 1838 to 1922. It started as the London and Southampton Railway from Waterloo station to Southampton. 
Later, the network extended to Plymouth via Salisbury and Exeter. There were branches to Ilfracombe and Padstow. Beyond Southampton there were branches to Bournemouth and Weymouth. The LSWR also had many routes connecting towns in Hampshire and Berkshire, including Portsmouth and Reading.

An epitaph is a short text honouring a deceased person. Strictly speaking, it is text that is carved on a tombstone or plaque. Usually it gives the person’s name and dates of birth and death. Some epitaphs say what the person did, and other things. Some people write their own epitaphs before they die.


2020 UEFA Champions League Final

The 2020 UEFA Champions League Final was the final match of the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League. It was played on 23 August 2020 at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal, between Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich. The match was held behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. Originally, it had been scheduled to be played at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey, on 30 May 2020. On 17 June 2020, the UEFA Executive Committee chose to relocate the final to Lisbon as part of a "final-eight tournament" consisting of single-match knockout ties played in two stadiums across the city.

"In the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup era, since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League era."
The final was originally scheduled to be played at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey, on 30 May 2020. However, UEFA announced on 23 March 2020 that the final was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 17 June 2020, the UEFA Executive Committee chose to relocate the final to Lisbon as part of a "final-eight tournament" consisting of single-match knockout ties played in two stadiums across the city.

The UEFA Executive Committee chose the Estádio da Luz, officially known as the Estádio do Sport Lisboa e Benfica, in Lisbon as the final venue at their meeting on 17 June 2020.

The home stadium of Benfica since 2003, it was rebuilt to host five matches of UEFA Euro 2004, including the final. Before its demolition in 2003, to make way for the new 65,000-capacity ground, the original Estádio da Luz hosted the 1992 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, where Werder Bremen beat Monaco 2–0, and the second leg of the 1983 UEFA Cup Final, where Anderlecht secured a 1–1 draw with Benfica to lift the trophy.

Lisbon had also hosted a European Cup final in 1967, when Celtic beat Inter Milan 2–1 at the Estádio Nacional. Lisbon also hosted the 2005 UEFA Cup Final at the Estádio José Alvalade, home of Benfica's local rivals and finalists Sporting CP, who lost 3–1 to CSKA Moscow.

Paris Saint-Germain reached their first Champions League final. They entered the final having played 110 matches in the European Cup and Champions League, the most for a final debutant, surpassing Arsenal's record of 90 matches prior to their final appearance in 2006.

Bayern Munich reached their eleventh Champions League final, tying Milan for the second-most finals behind Real Madrid's 16. Recently, they appeared in the 2013 final, in which they won 2–1 against Borussia Dortmund for their fifth title. 

"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away; N: neutral)."
The original identity of the 2020 UEFA Champions League Final was unveiled at the group stage draw on 29 August 2019.

The ambassador for the original Istanbul final was Hamit Altıntop, who finished as runner-up in the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League with Bayern Munich as well as winning the 2003 and 2004 UEFA Intertoto Cups with Schalke 04.

On 20 August 2020, UEFA named Italian Daniele Orsato as the referee for the final. He was joined with Lorenzo Manganelli and Alessandro Giallatini as assistant referees, Massimiliano Irrati as the video assistant referee and Marco Guida as the assistant VAR official. The fourth official was Ovidiu Hațegan, while Roberto Díaz Pérez del Palomar and Alejandro Hernández Hernández served as the offside and support VAR officials, respectively.

Each team made one change to their starting line-up following the semi-finals. After recovering from injury, Keylor Navas started in place of Sergio Rico. For Bayern Munich, Hansi Flick decided to replace Ivan Perišić, and Kingsley Coman on the left wing. Jérôme Boateng was also fit to start for Bayern, having suffered a minor injury in the semi-final which required him to be substituted off at half-time.

The "home" team (for administrative purposes) was determined by an additional draw held on 10 July 2020 (after the quarter-final and semi-final draws), at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.

London, Brighton and South Coast Railway

The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR was a railway company in England from 1846 to 1922. Its territory formed a rough triangle, with London at its apex, most of the coastline of Sussex as its base, and a large part of Surrey. The LBSCR had the most direct routes from London to the south coast seaside resorts of Brighton, Eastbourne, Worthing, Littlehampton and Bognor Regis, and to the ports of Newhaven and Shoreham-by-Sea. It served the inland towns/cities of Chichester, Horsham, East Grinstead and Lewes, and jointly served Croydon, Tunbridge Wells, Dorking and Guildford. At the London end was a complicated suburban and outer-suburban network of lines emanating from London Bridge and Victoria, and shared interests in two cross-London lines.

The LBSCR was formed by a merger of five companies in 1846. On 1 January 1923, it became part of the Southern Railway under the Railways Act 1921.

Shoreham-by-Sea

Shoreham-by-Sea (often shortened to Shoreham) is a seaside town and port in West Sussex, England.

South Eastern Railway (UK)

The South Eastern Railway (SER) was a railway company in south-eastern England from 1836 to 1922. The company was formed to construct a route from London to Dover. Branch lines were later opened to Tunbridge Wells, Hastings, Canterbury and other places in Kent. The SER absorbed or leased other railways, including the London and Greenwich Railway and the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway. Most of the company's routes were in Kent, eastern Sussex and the London suburbs. There was also a long cross-country route from Redhill, Surrey to Reading, Berkshire.
Much of the company's early history saw attempts at expansion. This sometimes led to feuds with its neighbours, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) in the west and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) to the north-east. However, in 1899 the SER agreed with the LCDR to share operation of the two railways and work them as a single system, marketed as the South Eastern and Chatham Railway. Receipts were pooled but it was not a full amalgamation. The SER and LCDR remained separate companies until they became constituents of the Southern Railway on 1 January 1923 under the Railways Act 1921.

William Oughtred

William Oughtred 5 March 1574 – 30 June 1660) was an English mathematician and Anglican clergyman.

He also introduced the "×" multiplication sign and the abbreviations "sin" and "cos" for the sine and cosine functions.

London, Chatham and Dover Railway

The London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) was a railway company in south-eastern England (registered 1 August 1859). It was previously called the East Kent Railway. 

Its lines ran through London and northern and eastern Kent to form a part of the Greater London commuter network. The railway was always in a difficult financial situation. It went bankrupt in 1867 but was able to continue to operate. Many of the difficulties were caused by competition and duplication of services with the South Eastern Railway (SER). However, in 1898 the LCDR agreed with the SER to share the operation of the two railways and work them as a single system under the name South Eastern and Chatham Railway. Receipts were pooled but it was not a full amalgamation. 

The SER and LCDR remained separate companies until they became part of the Southern Railway on 1 January 1923 (Railways Act 1921).

South Eastern and Chatham Railway

The South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR), was a working union of two neighbouring railways, the South Eastern Railway (SER) and London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR), which operated between London and south east England. Between 1899 and 1923, the SECR had a monopoly of railway services in Kent and to the main Channel ports for ferries to France and Belgium. In 1923, the SECR became a part of the Southern Railway under the Railways Act 1921.

Caledonian Railway

The Caledonian Railway (CR) was a major Scottish railway company. It was formed in the early 19th century to form a link between English railways and Glasgow. It steadily extended its network and reached Edinburgh and Aberdeen. It also had a dense network of branch lines in the area surrounding Glasgow. It was absorbed by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923 under the Railways Act 1921. Many of its main routes are still used. The original main line between Carlisle and Glasgow is now part of the West Coast Main Line. 

Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway

The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR) was a major British railway company before the 1923 Grouping. It was created in 1847 by joining the Manchester and Leeds Railway and a number of smaller railway companies. It was the third largest railway system based in Northern England. Only the Midland Railway and the North Eastern Railway were bigger.

It was the first mainline railway to introduce electrification of some of its lines. It also ran steamboat services across the Irish Sea and North Sea. It was a bigger shipowner than any other British railway company.

It amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922. One year later, the merged company became the largest constituent of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway under the Railways Act 1921.

Brett Kavanaugh

Brett Michael Kavanaugh ( ; born February 12, 1965) is an American judge. He is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States since October 6, 2018. He was the United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He was Staff Secretary in the Executive Office of the President of the United States under President George W. Bush.

Kavanaugh played an important part in writing the Starr report, which wanted the President Bill Clinton to be impeached.

Kavanaugh was chosen by President Donald Trump on July 9, 2018, to become an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, after Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy retired, leaving an empty space.

During the confirmation, two women (including Christine Blasey Ford), accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct during his time at university. Kavanaugh said that this did not happen.

Kavanaugh was born in Washington, D.C.. He was born to Martha Gamble (Murphy) and Everett Edward Kavanaugh Jr. He was raised in Bethesda, Maryland. He attended the same high school as Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch (just two years apart).

Kavanaugh, very active in college sports, attended Yale University. He graduated from Yale in 1987 with a Bachelor of Arts "cum laude". He graduated from Yale Law School with a Juris Doctor in 1990.

Kavanaugh first worked as a law clerk for Judge Walter King Stapleton of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Kavanaugh was admitted to the Maryland Bar in 1990 and the District of Columbia Bar in 1992.

Kavanaugh then earned a one-year partnership with the Solicitor General of the United States, Ken Starr. Kavanaugh next clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy 1993–1994.

From 1997 to 1998, Kavanaugh was a partner at the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis. In 1998 he rejoined Starr as an Associate Counselor.

Kavanaugh was a principal author of the "Starr Report" to Congress, released in September 1998, on the Monica Lewinsky–Bill Clinton sex scandal; the report supported Clinton's impeachment.

In December 2000, Kavanaugh joined the legal team of George W. Bush, which was trying to stop the ballot recount in Florida following the 2000 election. After Bush became president in January 2001, Kavanaugh was hired as an associate by the White House Counsel, Alberto Gonzales.

In July 2003, he became Assistant to the President and White House Staff Secretary.

President George W. Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on July 25, 2003. His nomination stalled in the Senate for nearly three years. Democratic senators accused him of being too partisan. In 2003, the American Bar Association had rated Kavanaugh as "well qualified".

The Senate Judiciary Committee recommended he be confirmed on a 10–8 party-line vote on May 11, 2006, he was confirmed by the Senate on May 26 by a vote of 57–36. He was sworn in June 1.

Kavanaugh was one of four U.S. Court of Appeals judges to receive a personal 45-minute interview by President Donald Trump as a possible replacement for Justice Anthony Kennedy. On July 9, 2018, Trump nominated Kavanaugh for a seat on the Supreme Court.

Political commentators said that Kavanaugh's nomination would push the Supreme Court to the right for many years. He is a known critic of abortion and Roe v. Wade decision. He is a supporter of the "Brown v. Board of Education" decision calling it the "single greatest Supreme Court decision in history".

On September 28, 2018, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to confirm Kavanaugh to a full Senate vote in early October 2018. He was confirmed on October 6, 2018 with a 50 to 48 vote.

On September 27, 2018, Professor Christine Blasey Ford, accused him of sexual assault when they were both in high school. Republican members of the committee did not question Ford directly rather a Republican-hired investigator.

Ford said that they were both “visibly drunk” and that Kavanaugh had locked her into a bedroom, where he groped her and tried to take off her clothes. She said she “believed he was going to rape me” and feared for her life when he held his hand over her mouth. In his opening statement, Kavanaugh claimed the accusations were politically motivated by Democrats and Bill Clinton.

After Ford opened up about her accusations, two more women accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault/harassment. Deborah Ramirez accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself when they were at Yale. Later, former government employee Julie Swetnick, accused Kavanaugh of drugging her and raping her in a gang rape.

After the Senate committee vote, Senators Flake, Manchin and Murkowski called for an FBI investigation into the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh. President Trump ordered a limited investigation.

Kavanaugh met his wife, Ashley Estes Kavanaugh, while working at the White House in 2001. They have two daughters. Kavanaugh is a Catholic. He lives in Washington, D.C.

Kavanaugh ran the Boston Marathon in 2010 and 2015.

Liverpool Overhead Railway

The Liverpool Overhead Railway (known locally as the Dockers' Umbrella) was an elevated railway in Liverpool which operated along the Liverpool Docks. It opened in 1893 with lightweight electric multiple units. The design of an overhead line probably originated from the New York High Line which was authorised in 1847. Just five years later, in 1852, the need arose in Liverpool for a similar solution. The railway had a number of world firsts:

It was also the second oldest electric metro in the world. The only earlier one was the 1890 City and South London Railway. In the early 1900s electric trains ran on the electrified Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway to Southport and Aintree. Special trains to Aintree for the horse race meetings ran twice a year after regular services were withdrawn. Being a local railway it was not nationalised in 1948.

In 1955, a report into the structure of the many viaducts showed major repairs were needed that the company could not afford. The railway closed at the end of 1956. Despite public protests the structures were dismantled in the following year.

Johann Baptist Allgaier

Johann Baptist Allgaier (19 June 1763, Schussenried – 3 January 1823, Vienna) was a German-Austrian chess master and theoretician. He was also the author of the first chess handbook in German – "Neue theoretisch-praktische Anweisung zum Schachspiel" (Vienna 1795–96).

Johann Baptist Allgaier was born in 1763 in the Duchy of Württemberg. His father, Georg Allgaier, worked at a monastery as a "Hofmeister", the person in charge of the education of the children of the rich and noble families. Johann's father wanted him to study theology. On a trip to Poland he learned to play chess. In 1798, he moved to Vienna and joined the army. He was able to improve his chess skills. In 1780, he won a game with a prize of 1500 florins and became Vienna's best player. He taught many people to play chess, including the sons and brothers of the Emperor Francis II.

Allgaier fought in the Napoleonic wars between Austria and France. In 1809, he worked in an army hospital, where he became ill with asthma. When the hospital was moved to Prague he became its accountant. He returned to Vienna in 1816 where the Emperor gave him a small pension. To make extra money, he played chess in the cafés. His games were said to be brilliant and focused on attacking. When he played, people would come to watch. One man, Santo Vito, wrote down some of these games which were included in Allgaier's book. He would play anyone for the price of one gulden. The price also included a short lesson after the game. Allgaier was always looking for ways to make money. This is probably why he worked with Mälzel to operate the Turk. Allgaier played hidden inside the chess machine in 1809. He is believed to be the player controlling the Turk when it won a game against Napoleon at Schönbrunn Palace.

In December 1822, he was sent to the military hospital in Vienna and died a few days later of dropsy. 

In 1795 and 1796  he published his book "Neue Theoretische-praktische Anweisung zum Schachspiel." This was said to be the best chess book of the time. It was reprinted several times, the seventh and final edition was in 1843.

After his premiership he was the Speaker of the Finnish Parliament from 1989 to 1991. During his career he also served twice as Deputy Prime Minister, from 1975 to 1976 and from 1987 to 1989. From 1987 to 1996, Sorsa served on the governing board of the Bank of Finland.

Sorsa is regarded as one of Finland's most influential prime ministers, making major contributions to schools and health care, and increasing social security for families with children and pensioners. His governments strengthened the welfare state in Finland, by enacting many reforms—child care laws, longer maternity leave, the annual vacation benefit act, as well as the public health act.

In domestic politics, Sorsa had a particularly difficult relationship with Paavo Väyrynen, the strong-willed head of the Center Party. Another notable conflict was his rivalry with young rising politician Paavo Lipponen.

In June 1984, Sorsa gave a speech on "infocracy" (i.e. the power of the mass media) at the Social Democratic party convention. Infocracy challenges parliamentary democracy, is unintelligent and avoids discussing social problems, he said: it takes more interest in individual politicians than political issues and is never critical of its own actions.


Hyacinthe Henri Boncourt

Hyacinthe Henri Boncourt (1765? – March 23, 1840) was one of the leading chess players in France in the years between 1820 and 1840.

Not much is known about his life. The date of his birth, 1765, is based on a comment by an English chess player, George Walker, that in 1839 Boncourt was about 70 years old.

Boncourt learned how to play chess from students of the great François-André Danican Philidor, including Carlier, Bernard and Leger who often played at the Café de la Régence. 

He was a civil servant, and chess was mostly a hobby for him. He got his best results after he was 60 years old when after retiring from work, he could spend all his time playing chess.

In 1818, for a brief period, he was one of the players hidden inside the chess machine, the Turk. At one time he was sick, and he did not play very well. While he was hiding inside the Turk, he could not stop coughing and he could be heard by people watching. After this, the owner of the Turk, Mälzel, added some noisy gears. This was simply to cover any noise coming from the person inside.


Aaron Alexandre

Aaron (Albert) Alexandre (, around 1765/68 in Hohenfeld, Franconia – 16 November 1850 in London, England) was a Jewish German–French–English chess player and writer.

Aaron Alexandre trained as a rabbi. He arrived in France in 1793. He taught German and was a mechanical inventor. He later became a full-time chess player. He wrote a book of all the known chess openings, the "Encyclopédie des échecs" ("Encyclopedia of Chess", Paris, 1837). In the book, he used the algebraic notation and the castling symbols 0–0 and 0–0–0.

His next book was about the endgame and a collection of about 2000 chess problems, which he published in 1846 as "Collection des plus beaux Problèmes d'Echecs", Paris. English and German translations: "Beauties of Chess", London, and "Praktische Sammlung bester Schachspiel-Probleme", Leipzig.

Both books became standard reference books, demonstrating Alexandre’s great technical knowledge. Alexandre was also one of the chess players who worked inside the chess playing machine, the Turk.

Stacey Abrams

Stacey Yvonne Abrams (born December 9, 1973) is an American politician, lawyer, romance novelist, and businesswoman. She was the house minority leader for the Georgia General Assembly and state representative for the 89th House District. She is a member of the Democratic Party.
Abrams was the Democratic nominee in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election, the first black female major party gubernatorial nominee in the United States. She lost the general election to Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp. Abrams erroneously claimed she won the governorship and today still claims the election was stolen from her. 

In June 2018 Stacey Abrams joined the 9th annual Augusta Pride festival and talked about her campaign.

Abrams received a single vote from Rep. Kathleen Rice for the 2019 election for Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.

In early February 2019, Abrams became the first African-American woman to deliver a State of the Union response to President Trump's earlier delivery.

On December 1, 2021, she announced she would be once again running for governor in the 2022 gubernatorial election. She was defeated by Brian Kemp in the general election.

Maryland Gazette

The Gazette, founded in 1727 as The Maryland Gazette, is one of the oldest newspapers in America. Its based on "The Capital,". It was bought by The Baltimore Sun Media Group in 2014. Before, it was owned by the Capital Gazette Communications group, which published "The Capital", "Bowie Blade-News", "Crofton-West County Gazette", and "Capital Style" Magazine.

The Capital

The Capital is a daily newspaper published in Annapolis since 1884. Its sister newspaper, "The Gazette", is one of the oldest newspapers in America.

"The Capital" serves the city of Annapolis, much of Anne Arundel County, and neighboring Kent Island in Queen Anne's County. "The Capital" was bought by The Baltimore Sun Media Group in 2014.

William Lewis (chess player)

William Lewis (1787–1870) was an English chess player and author. He is best known for the Lewis Countergambit and for being the first player ever to be described as a Grandmaster of the game.

Born in Birmingham, William Lewis moved to London where he worked for a merchant. He became a student of chess player Jacob Sarratt. In later years he showed himself to be very unkind to his old teacher. He said Sarratt's "Treatise on the Game of Chess" (1808) was a "poorly written book". But in 1822 three years after Sarrat died, Lewis published a second edition of it. This was in competition with a much better revision by Sarrat published in 1821 by Sarratt's poverty-stricken widow. In 1843, many players gave money to help the old widow, but Lewis' name is not on the list.

Around 1819 Lewis was the hidden player inside the Turk, a fake chess playing machine. He told Johann Maelzel that Peter Unger Williams, also a student of Sarratt, should be the next person to operate inside the machine. Maezel took his advice and Williams replaced Lewis.

Lewis began writing books including translations of the works of Greco and Carrera, published in 1819 and 1822.

He was the leading English player in a game played by letters sent between London and Edinburgh in 1824, won by the Scots. He wrote a book on the match with analysis of the games. In 1834–36 he was on the Committee of the Westminster Chess Club. They lost games played by letter with the Paris Chess Club. The other players were his students McDonnell and Walker, while the French team included Boncourt, Alexandre, St. Amant and Chamouillet. When De La Bourdonnais visited England in 1825, Lewis played about 70 games with the French master.

Lewis was known as a famous chess player in his time. The weekly magazine "Bell's Life" in 1838 called him "our past grandmaster", the first known use of the term in chess. In 1825 he began a chess club where he taught people to play the game. He wrote two books on how to play chess, the Series of Progressive Lessons (1831) and Second Series of Progressive Lessons (1832). 

Lewis's books, and those of his teacher Sarratt, were based on reworking François-André Danican Philidor's ideas to those of the Modenese school of Del Rio, Lolli and Ponziani. Lewis gradually stopped playing competition chess. 

After his retirement he wrote other chess books, but he was no longer up to date with new ideas. The Oxford Chess Companion said his last book, "A Treatise on Chess" (1844), was already "out of date when published".


Mod (video games)

A video game mod is a change made to a video game. The word "mod" is short for "modification." A mod can be a change to any part of a game, including how it sounds, how it plays, the way it looks, or anything else. They are usually created by fans of a game instead of the people who made the original game. Mods are usually put on the internet for free when they are released.

Mods can be as small or as large as the creators want it to be. They can be minor bug fixes, or they can change so many things that they become a completely different game. Large mods like that are sometimes called "total conversions". Some popular examples of total conversion mods that became separate video games are Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, and Killing Floor. 

Mods can help a game become more famous and successful. Many people think that good mods can make a game more fun and interesting than the original. Some video game companies saw this and decided to give mod creators tools to help them make even more mods. Examples of companies that have done this are id Software, Valve Corporation, Mojang AB, and Bethesda Softworks.

Sometimes, a mod of a game might become just as popular as the original game, or more popular. When this happens, the word "vanilla" is often used to talk about the original game without mods.

Since 2005 he played different tournaments, for example the World Junior Circuit, where Filus reached the Quarterfinal. At the World Championships he came under the best eight players in the doubles. His first tournament at the Pro Tour end with the reaching of the last 64. 2006 Filus won bronze at the European Championships for youth, with the team he won gold. Since 2007 he played in the adult area, too, where he reached the Round of tha last 16 at the Korea Open. 2008 he played some Pro Tour tournaments, since 2009 he played different events, for example the European Championships, where Ruwen came under the top eight, he lost to Timo Boll. 2010 he played only two events, so he fell back to place 60 in the world rankings. 2011 Ruwen played at the World Cup, there he won bronze together with the team. At the WTTC he came under the last 64 in the singles. At the European Championships he won gold with the team. 2012 he came under the last 16 at the ETTC, on the Pro Tour he won the Czech Open. 2013 he won bronze at the Czech Open and came to the Quarterfinal at the ETTC. 2014 he had very strong injuries, but in 2015 he reached the Quarterfinal at the ETTC again, with the team he won silver. 2016 the German team lost in the group qualification. 2017 he won gold with the German team at the ETTC, 2018 was it silver at the WTTC.



Ruwen has a daughter who's severely disabled.

Data Center Cooling

Data cooling is one of the most fundamental IT environment processes especially when it concerns a data center. As the new computer hardware becomes more compact while using the same amount or at times more electricity than the one that has been replaced, more heat is being produced inside the data centers. For collecting and transferring the remaining heat energy to the external atmosphere, accurate air conditioning and heat removal equipment is needed. The main goal is to transfer and transport unutilized heat energy from the IT environment to the external atmosphere.

Monitoring our service in real-life situations can be proved most of the times also equally important. With specific environmental sensors we can regulate,monitor and control data center’s temperature, airflow and hotspots and in general be aware of the quality of the “internal” environment and temperature in the data center.

A computer room air conditioning (CRAC) unit is an apparatus that controls and maintains environmental features in the data center like temperature and humidity. While CRAC units makes use of mechanical refrigeration, a computer room air handler (CRAH) uses fans, cooling coils and a water-chiller system to remove heat.

The aim of cooling is to transfer heat from the data center (indoor environment) to the outside environment. There are two basic approaches for removing the remaining heat, either using air or liquid (typically water).

Air cooling has some important advantages as it’s practically easy to move and it doesn’t provoke any damage to the IT apparatus. Since heat flows from the warmer objects to the cooler ones and warm air is increasing with respect to cold air this means that can make us distinguish them in some level. In fact many manufacturers of air-based cooling designs consider this particular property while constructing IT equipment.

Room based cooling, as an air cooling system, uses the most classical type of refrigerating technique: the basic idea is that coolers push cold air in the environment, extracting warm air to the outside. Conditioners not only refresh, but also mix the air to avoid hot spots. This idea results to be efficient if the power load used for mixing the air is a small fraction of the total load of the datacenter. Simulations show that this approach is valid for relatively low power load densities (320-750 formula_1). Sometimes, when warm and hot air are being mixed the previous distinction is not plausible and this is where issues arise.

Hot/cold aisle is a format for racks of servers and generally IT apparatus inside a data center where the rack fronts face the rack fronts of the adjacent row. When cold aisle containment approach is used, row doors, aisle ceilings or overhead vertical walls are installed to contain the cold air coming from the cooling systems into the cold aisles. As the opposite, in hot aisle containment the hot air is contained so that the CRAC units just receive hot air.

The aim of this configuration is to decrease the amount of produced energy and reduce the costs regarding the cooling process by controlling the air flow.

If racks have empty space that it is not used then extra heat is being released into data center’s airflow in order to “fill in” this unused space.The use of blanking panels can prevent the hot air from being transmitted in the data center’s airflow.

The top of the rack is considered to be the location which produces the greatest amount of heat. So, the specific placement of the racks can reduce the heat circulation from racks hot spots. The way that we can regulate this issue is by ordering rack components in a way that the more loaded equipment is placed on the lower racks and in such way we can ensure an optimal cooling. Since heavier equipment flow the most air, a lower rack placement will ensure that less heat is spreaded at the top of the rack.

The free cooling method is composed of two main systems: the air-side economization and the water-side economization. The first one basically uses the air that comes from the outer environment in order to control and adjust the desired temperature in the IT apparatus. This technique is quite productive with respect to its cost (since we just take advantage of air from the external environment) but on the other hand has some disadvantages since it is likely to provoke humidity and moisture in the data center.

In a similar way, water-side economization works with air from the outdoors and is commonly used with evaporation processes.

Liquid cooling can improve the efficiency of a data center as it provides an optimal and more targeted cooling. For example chilled water can be transferred directly to a rack of servers which is quite helpful as we want to provide cooling to specific places. Instead of trying to “balance” a desirable temperature throughout an entire room, it initializes the cooling process in the exact point that is needed; at a particular rack or cabinet. On the other hand, the use of liquid-based systems inside a data center could have some cons. Possible leaks are definitely a huge threat for the entire IT apparatus, transport of liquid may cause condensation and since the chilled liquid must be contained somewhere it requires more technological equipment and a suitable framework inside the data center; so in this case we need more resources. For the above reasons, although liquid-based systems are proved to be more reliable and effective, they appear to be quite expensive with respect to air cooling techniques and slightly more difficult to implement.

Using the setup of a liquid-based system, here the IT apparatus can be cooled by using water, or alternative cooling liquids to be pumped at server or rack level: cold plates are located as close as possible to the heat generating components. This technology makes use of the higher heat transfer capacity of the liquids, leading to greater savings in terms of energy requirement, in fact, single phase cooling systems can reduce, and sometimes eliminate needing for CRAC units.

One of the most important disadvantages is that they require high pumping power. Other side effects are microbe formation, electrical conductivity of the liquids and erosive nature due to high fluid velocities.

As the surface to be cooled increases, it is more difficult to achieve isothermality.

The main advantage, following an on-chip cooling approach is that, since direct discharge liquid stream is used, the energy capture is easier, permitting the waste heat recovery.

One of the pioneers of this technology has been , with the Aquasar supercomputer, in 2009.

Two-phase cooling means using devices that can transform at least part of the cooling fluids into vapour when in contact with warm IT components. The phase transition permits a much more efficient heat exchange, in terms of cooling medium mass: in other words: to exchange a fixed amount of heat, two-phase cooling uses less refrigerating liquid in comparison with the quantity which is necessary in single-phase cooling.

It was shown how, using multiphase systems, 4 times less mass-flow rates, 10 times less pumping power and 2 times less facility size.

The core of the evaporator is composed by a mini or heat-sink by which the plate surface is maximized; minichannels have a pitch of 2 to 8 mm, while microchannels have a pitch of less than 1 mm. Microchannels are more capable in transferring the heat thanks to their higher surface, but they are more easily clogged, corroded and eroded.

There are many options available to services or IT experts when it comes to specifying cooling solutions. These options may differ according to the size or the particular type of the solution needed.

Referring to the airflow process, large floor-mounted systems flow air in a downward direction (leading towards a lower flow level) or an upward direction (leading towards a higher flow level) and some can even flow horizontally (leading towards a horizontal flow level).

These devices are best used in combination with IT monitoring and building management systems for quicker notification. They also provide early warning or automatic shut off during undesirable events. 

As a device that increases humidity, humidifiers can play an important role in the cooling process by preventing any unexpected overheating which may occur due to static electrical discharge.They are usually placed inside precision cooling devices in order to replace water vapor lost during the cooling process. Reassuring that the room has no current high or low humidity-related issues, the use of humidifiers can be in all computer room air conditioners and air handlers.

When performing the particular technique, rooms should not have vapor barriers and also room temperatures should suggest humid climates. These systems in order to let the whole system provide increased dehumidification of the "internal" air, they add heat to conditioned cold air coming out of a precision cooling device.

The advantage of using this approach is that it provides a surprisingly operating cost reduction when used.In this approach, (ethylene glycol) is used to cool the IT environment in a way which is similar to a chilled water system.

Data centers technology is quite complex and advanced and this has as a result to require huge amounts of energy. Therefore, data centers need to be as efficient as possible and data environmental control has a significant role to this issue.

The recommended temperature for a data center is estimated between 21°C and 24°C. In addition to,some studies regarding the desired temperature in a data center shown that maybe it is not so optimal (money-wise) for firms to keep the temperature below 21°C. Furthermore, typical data center limit temperatures have been estimated to be 85°C for processors and DIMMs, while disk drives can usually work in stricter conditions, at a maximum of 45°C. 

It is also remarkable that, while the conventional heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems (HVAC) for similar size rooms deal with heat fluxes in the order of 40-90 formula_1, cooling systems in data centers work with extremely higher heat loads: modern data center infrastructures can need to refresh apparatus that produces 6-10 formula_3 as power density. In the next few years, it is estimated that the power density consumption will still raise up to 15 formula_3.

Google for instance mentions the significance of taking serious action to reinforce energy efficiency in case of either running a small data center or a huge service. According to Google, many manufactures construct the suitable equipment to be used at temperatures higher than the standard 21°C we aforementioned. This may lead to next generation servers having the ability of performing at higher temperatures, fact that can make data center using less equipment and therefore save money. So for an effective management and control data centers should be able to perform accurate temperature analysis by measuring the amount of energy spent for processes that concern cooling.Nevertheless, the best solution may be consulting the corresponding equipment manufacturer so with his expertise can point out the suitable approach. 

Many opinions of experts about this subject point out that data centers could have better performance if they could adopt a mixture of cooling methods. Another important factor that could drastically contribute to an optimal performance is the location where data centers are placed. Constructing data centers either in places with cooler climates or near to sources of cold water not only could increase energy efficiency in a high level but also could reduce costs by deploying the external environment.

November 1989 tornado outbreak

The November 1989 tornado outbreak was a natural disaster in the United States from November 15-16, 1989.

During the morning hours of November 14, the local forecasts issued a warning for severe thunderstorms on Wednesday.

At 9:30 a.m. on November 15, the National Severe Storms Forecast Center issued a strong potential for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes across the Tennessee Valley. At 10:50 a.m., the Birmingham office issued a major severe weather threat for Alabama and northern Florida.

A tornado watch was issued at 12:45 p.m. CST and was in effect until 8:00 p.m. CST that evening. Shortly thereafter, warnings were coming out as a squall line passed through. Spotters reported large hail and damaging winds at this time.

At the time of the tornado, a severe thunderstorm warning was in effect. Later, they spotted rotation in the wall cloud, but the rotation dissipated shortly thereafter. At 4:25 p.m., the rotation picked up again.

The tornado hit during the afternoon rush hour, killing 21 people and injuring 463 others. Most of these deaths happened in cars (similar to the 1979 Wichita Falls tornado). This was rated an F4 on the Fujita Scale.

A downburst struck East Coldenham Elementary School on November 16, 1989 at 11:35 a.m., blowing down a cafeteria wall, killing nine people and injuring eighteen. This was considered a F1 tornado. Former President Ronald Reagan was on the site within minutes.

Video chat

Video chat is a way of communicating online using the Internet. It uses a camera and microphone in a computer or smart phone. This allows people to see and hear each other.

For streaming video a speed of at least 2 Mbps is needed, to prevent a choppy signal and disconnects. For sound transmission, much less speed is required, so people often turn off video when the internet connection is slow.

Video chat is a very popular form of communication in the 21st century. It is often used for many reasons;


There are various software packages which make this possible.

Council of Foreign Ministers

Council of Foreign Ministers was an organisation agreed upon at the Potsdam Conference in 1945 and announced in the Potsdam Agreement.

The Potsdam Agreement specified that the Council would be composed of the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, China, France, and the United States. It would normally meet in London (at Lancaster House) and the first meeting was to take place no later than 1 September 1945. As the immediate important task, the Council was authorised to draw up treaties of peace with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Finland, and to propose settlements of territorial questions outstanding on the termination of the war in Europe. Also the Council should prepare a peace settlement for Germany to be accepted when a "government adequate for the purpose is established".

Metal rectifier

A metal rectifier is an early type of semiconductor rectifier in which the semiconductor is copper oxide or selenium. They were used to convert alternating current to direct current. They were often used in devices such as radios and battery chargers. Westinghouse Electric was a major manufacturer of these rectifiers since the late 1920s.

In some countries the term "metal rectifier" is applied to all such devices. In other countries the term "metal rectifier" normally refers to copper-oxide types, and "selenium rectifier" to selenium-iron types.


Mercury-arc rectifier

A Mercury-arc rectifier is a type of rectifier used for converting alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). The cathode is made from a pool of liquid mercury. Mercury-arc rectifiers were rugged and durable. They could carry higher currents than most other types of rectifier.

The mercury-arc rectifier was invented in 1902 by Peter Cooper Hewitt. They were used to provide power for industrial electric motors, electric railways, trams, and electric locomotives. Other uses included radio transmitters and high-voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission. They were the primary method of high power rectification before the advent of solid-state electronics in the 1970s. The solid-state rectifier has since replaced the mercury-arc rectifier.

Gas turbine

A gas turbine, also called a combustion turbine, is a type of internal combustion engine. The simplest form has three main parts:

The diagram shows a single-shaft gas turbine. One turbine drives both the compressor and the load, such as an electric generator. There are also two-shaft gas turbines, with separate turbines to drive the compressor and the load. Two-shaft turbines are better for driving road and rail vehicles because they can give more torque at low speed.



Theorema egregium

Gauss's Theorema Egregium (Latin for "Remarkable Theorem") is a major result of differential geometry proved by Carl Friedrich Gauss. The theorem is about the curvature of surfaces. The theorem states that curvature can be determined by measuring angles, distances and their rates on a surface alone. There is no need to talk about the particular manner in which the surface is embedded in the surrounding three-dimensional Euclidean space. In other words, the Gaussian curvature of a surface does not change if one bends the surface without stretching it. 

Gauss presented the theorem in this manner (translated from Latin):

The theorem is "remarkable" because the starting "definition" of Gaussian curvature makes direct use of the position of the surface in space. So it is quite surprising that the result does "not" depend on its embedding in spite of all bending and twisting deformations undergone.

Two-stroke engine

The two-stroke engine is an internal combustion engine. The two strokes are:
Unlike a four-stroke engine, there are no intake and exhaust strokes. When the piston is at bottom dead center, fuel-air mixture is blown in under slight pressure. The incoming mixture forces out the exhaust gas at the same time. The animation shows an engine with crankcase compression to force in the fuel-air mixture. Some engines use a rotary blower instead. These engines use mixed fuel (often 50:1) primarily high octane gasoline, partially two-stroke oil.

Anchorite

An anchorite (female: anchoress) from "one who has retired from the world", is someone who, for religious reasons, withdraws from secular society so as to be able to lead an intensely prayer-filled, ascetic life. Anchorites are often considered to be a type of religious hermit, unlike hermits, anchorites had to make a promise to God to stay in one place, which was a very small room, either attached to, or within the wall of, a local church. 

The anchoritic life is one of the earliest forms of being a Christian monk. From the 12th to the 16th centuries, female anchorites consistently outnumbered their male equivalents, sometimes by as many as four to one (in the 13th century), dropping eventually to two to one (in the 15th century). The sex of a high number of anchorites, however, is not recorded for these periods.

Maratha Empire

The Maratha Empire, or Maratha Confederacy, was a group of Indian states that dominated much of the Indian subcontinent in the 17th and the 18th centuries. The empire formally existed from 1674 to 1818. The Marathas are given much of the credit for ending Mughal rule in India.

The Marathas were a warrior people from the western Deccan Plateau (present-day Maharashtra). They rose to prominence by establishing "self-rule of Hindu/Indian people" in their region. The Marathas became prominent in the 17th century under the leadership of Shivaji who revolted against the Adil Shahi dynasty and the Mughal Empire and formed a kingdom, with Raigad as his capital. Known for their mobility, the Marathas were able to consolidate their territory during the Mughal–Maratha Wars and later controlled a large part of the Indian subcontinent stretching from Peshawar in the north to Thanjavur in the south with their capital at Pune in the year 1758. 

Their power was eventually ended by the series of wars fought against the British Empire. The first two Anglo-Maratha wars resulted in a victory for the Marathas however the third one resulted in the defeat of the Marathas and annexation of the Maratha Empire in Maharashtra into British India. The Marathas had another opportunity to rebel against British rule and form their own kingdom in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. They joined this rebellion in the hopes of permanently kicking the British power out of India. However, by the end of 1859, the rebellion was crushed and all the Maratha rebel leaders were either executed or went into exile and took refuge in Nepal.

Jacques François Mouret

Jacques François Mouret (1787–1837) was a French chess player. He became the chess teacher of the future Louis Philippe I. He was one of the most successful operators of The Turk, a famous chess-playing machine.

Mouret was a great-nephew of the famous chess player François-André Danican Philidor. He learned the game at the Café de la Régence, taught by Bernard and Carlier, two of Philidor's students. He was a pupil of Alexandre Deschapelles and later he became a teacher of La Bourdonnais. He also gave chess lessons to the children of the French King Louis Philippe I. In 1819, he was the operator of The Turk during its tour in England and probably the person, who sold the secret of The Turk to the press.

Mouret was an alcoholic. In 1842 the editor of the chess magazine "Le Palamède", said  ""He was a clever fellow, sharp, gay, lively, amusing, and had studied seriously the theory of chess, by which he made his living. His talent redeemed a little the rudeness of his manner and a certain licentiousness which he indulged in. He used to be in a continual state of semi-intoxication"". George Walker wrote that ""His brain was consumed in the Brandy"".

Mouret was believed to have written a book in 1836, "The Treaty Elementary Game of Chess." But later evidence shows that he only made some corrections to the text.

He had no money when he died and so the members of the Chess Club of Paris paid for his funeral.

Mouret is best known as the person hidden inside The Turk, a fake chess-playing machine. Mouret was one of many great chess players who worked inside the machine, others being Johann Baptist Allgaier, who defeated Napoleon in 1809, Schlumberger, Boncourt and Lewis. Fifty games played by Mouret from inside the Turk in London in 1819, are collected in a book published in 1820. In the beginning of the book it was written that out of 300 games, the Turk (Mouret) only lost six. 

Mouret's weakness for drinking often left him without any money, so he probably sold the secret of the Turk in 1834 to "Le Magasin picturesque". The article, "An attempt to analyze the automaton chess-player of M. Kempelen", explained how a man could be hidden inside the Turk. Mouret was not named, but many people. including Walker, believe he was the source. The French master was sick and short of money at the time, and died three years later.

Mouret often used a move now called the French Defense. He was one of the only players to use it and is one of the main reasons for it being called the French Defense. Mouret taught the move to players at the Café de la Régence. One of his students convinced the Paris team to use the defense in games played by letters against a London team. Following the victory of the French team, the opening quickly became known as the French Defense.

Dungeness Nuclear Power Station

Dungeness nuclear power station refers to two nuclear power stations located at Dungeness in Kent, England. Dungeness A is an old Magnox power station. It began to operate in 1965. It has reached the end of its life and is no longer in use. Dungeness B is an advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) power station. It has two 615 MW reactors and began to operate between 1983 and 1985. Dungeness B was the first commercial scale AGR power station to be built.

Magnox

Magnox is a type of nuclear reactor designed to run on natural uranium. It uses graphite as a neutron moderator and carbon dioxide gas as a heat exchange coolant. The name Magnox comes from the magnesium-aluminium alloy used to clad the fuel rods inside the reactor. The Magnox was designed for producing both electric power and plutonium-239 for use in nuclear weapons.

Advanced gas-cooled reactor

The Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) is a type of nuclear reactor used in the United Kingdom. These are the second generation of British gas-cooled reactors. They use graphite as the neutron moderator and carbon dioxide as the coolant. They have been the backbone of the UK's nuclear generation fleet since the 1980s.

Torness Nuclear Power Station

Torness nuclear power station was the last of the United Kingdom's second generation nuclear power stations to be commissioned. It has two Advanced gas-cooled reactors. Construction began in 1980 and was completed in 1988. Torness nuclear power station is located approximately east of Edinburgh at Torness Point near Dunbar in East Lothian, Scotland. It is a local landmark and is highly visible from the main A1 road and East Coast Main Line railway.

Heysham nuclear power station

Heysham Nuclear Power Station is a nuclear power station located in Heysham, Lancashire, England. The site is divided into two separately-managed stations called Heysham 1 and Heysham 2. Each station has two advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGR).

Pressurized water reactor

Pressurized water reactors (PWRs) form the large majority of the world's nuclear power plants. In a PWR, the coolant (water) is pumped under high pressure to the reactor core where it is heated by the energy released by the fission of atoms. Pressure in the primary coolant loop prevents the water from boiling within the reactor. The heated water then flows to a steam generator where it transfers heat to a secondary system where steam is generated. The steam flows to a steam turbine which spins an electric generator. The used steam is condensed and returned to the steam generator for re-use. PWRs use ordinary water as both coolant and neutron moderator.


Mpemba effect

The Mpemba effect is that hot water can, under certain circumstances, not only freeze but do so quicker than colder water. This phenomenon has been reported as working as far back as Ancient Greece, even though it would seem contradictory to the laws of thermodynamics. In 1969 a scientist named Erasto B. Mpemba did experiments that proved that the effect is real, however, scientists are left with more questions than answers. Many solutions have been suggested as reasons for this phenomenon, but none have been agreed upon by scientists and most contradictory explanations were obtained by very different experiments with different controls. Perhaps someday after more study scientists will understand this, but currently the results are inconclusive at best.

Communications-based train control

Communications-based train control (CBTC) is a railway signaling system that makes use of telecommunications between the train and track equipment. By means of a CBTC system, the exact position of a train is known more accurately than with the traditional signaling systems. This results in a more efficient and safe way to manage trains. Metros (and other railway systems) are able to run more frequent trains while maintaining or even improving safety.Join Now

Bot

A bot is a computer program which acts automatically. It may do things that a person wouldn't normally do, or take a long time to do. It is an automated or semi-automated tool or script. They may be simple, or advanced and complex:

Societies are going through a rapid learning process at present. The freedom of bots to mine data is challenged. By mining data is meant collecting information about use, and about users, so as to advance some commercial or other purpose. In the European Union, for example, bots must now ask for permission to mine data from users. Before, they could collect any data they liked from users inorder to promote the welfare of the companies that used them.

There is a Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases. It is a directive of the European Union in the field of copyright law, made under the Treaty of Rome. The need to protect the data of "users" is a more recent development. 

Data mining is certain to be extremely important in the future. On Wikipedia the use of bots is frequent (see link above), but the use of data mining is minimal.

Parson's Cause

The "Parson's Cause" was a legal and political dispute in the Colony of Virginia. Many people think it was an  important event leading up to the American Revolution. The case was about the payment of clergy of the Anglican Church in Virginia. At the time, a lot of tobacco was planted in Virginia. It was one of the commodity crops of the colony. The colony of Virginia had passed laws in 1748: These laws said that Virginia's Anglican clergy were to be paid 16,000 pounds of tobacco per year. 

The problem was that the harvest of tobacco was poor in 1758. Because of that, the price of tobacco in Virginia rose from from two to six pennies per pound. This also meant the salary of clergy effectively tripled, that year. The state of Virginia was forced to act, and passed a law called the "Two Pennies Act": This law allowed the state authorities to pay the clergy in currency, instead of tobacco. It also fixed the exchange rate of tobacco: it said that for these payments, the state should take a rate of two  pennies per pound of tobacco.  King George III of Great Britain vetoed the law, causing an uproar in the colony. Many Virginia legislators saw the king's veto as a breach of their legislative authority.

Colonel John Henry, father of Patrick Henry, was the judge who presided over the court case and jury that decided the issue. Patrick Henry was the person who argued in favor of colonial rights in the case. He was relatively unknown at the time.

The Reverend James Maury had sued in Hanover County Court (April 1, 1762) for back wages on behalf of all the ministers involved: he effectively became a representative of the British cause. The court ruled (Nov. 5, 1763) that Maury's claim was valid, but that a jury had to determine the amount of damages. This jury was called for in December 1763. Patrick Henry rose to prominence by defending Hanover County against Maury's claims. Henry argued in favor of the Two Penny Act. As reported by the plaintiff Maury in a letter (Dec. 12, 1763) to fellow Anglican minister John Camm shortly after the trial, Henry argued in substance "that a King, by disallowing Acts of this salutary nature, from being the father of his people, degenerated into a Tyrant and forfeits all right to his subjects' obedience."

The jury awarded Maury one penny in damages. The award essentially nullified the Crown veto, and no other clergy sued.

The Hanover County Courthouse is still operating; historic U.S. Route 301 passes by it. The courthouse is next to the Hanover Tavern, where Patrick Henry lived while arguing the Parson's Cause. It is the third oldest courthouse still in use in the United States. The state historic office dates the building's construction between 1737 and 1742.

Aquatic locomotion

Aquatic locomotion is animals and other organisms moving through water. The surface of the world is mostly covered with water, and all major animal phyla started life in the water.

The earliest fossils we have are those of stromatolites, which are mat-like structures formed by photosynthetic bacteria in the sea. Even animals which evolved on land have often returned to the water, even though they usually continue to breath air. There are aquatic insects, reptiles, mammals and birds.

We don't quite know when the first animals and plants evolved, but some guesstimates have been made. Acritarchs are present from about 3200 to 1400 million years ago to the present. That's a wide time-range which means we cannot be sure when they evolved. They seem to have been grazed (eaten) by some early forms of life. Probably some kind of protist developed using existing life forms as food.

Locomotion is needed to find the right place in the seas, and to eat and avoid being eaten. All advanced forms of life, and many primitive forms of life, use locomotion.

The simplest propulsive systems evolved in microorganisms. Cilia and flagella are used.

Swimming has evolved a number of times in more complex life-forms. Examples include arthropods, fish, molluscs, reptiles, birds, and mammals.

Ciliates have hundreds or thousands of small flagella called cilia to move through the water. Certain organisms such as bacteria and animal sperm have a flagellum to move in liquid environments.

All aquatic invertebrates swim at some stage in their lives, and many swim for their entire life. All jellyfish swim by pulsing their cup-shaped bodies. Crustaceans swim with their legs. Some molluscs swim all their lives, some only as larvae.

Squid and octopods swim quite vigorously by 'jet propulsion'. They squirt water out to move.

There are a very large number of insects which are aquatic as larvae or adults. Almost all use their legs for swimming. They are air-breathing, and carry air with them as they swim. The air they get from the surface of the water, and take it down with them. Usually, the air is trapped among dense hairs on their surfaces. 13 orders of insects have aquatic stages, including all mayflies and dragonflies, and many beetles, bugs, and flies.

Bad Education

Bad Education is a 2004 Spanish drama movie. The movie was written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar.

It was released on 19 March 2004 in Spain and on 10 September 2004 in Mexico. It was also shown at many international film festivals, such as Cannes, New York City, Toronto and Moscow.

In 1980 Madrid, young movie director Enrique Goded is looking for his next project. He gets the unexpected visit of an actor looking for work. The actor says he's Enrique's boarding school friend and first love, Ignacio Rodriguez. Ignacio, who is now using the name Ángel Andrade, has brought with him a short story titled "The Visit". Ignacio hopes Enrique would be interested in making a movie out of it, and give him the starring role.

"The Visit" is set in 1977. It tells of a drag artist and transgender woman named Zahara. Her birth name is Ignacio. Zahara plans to rob a drunk admirer. But she then discovers the man is her lover Enrique.

Next, she visits her old school and meets Father Manolo. Manolo abused her when she was a boy. She asks for one million pesetas (Spanish currency) for halting publication of her story "The Visit". The story is set around a boarding school for boys in 1964. At the school, Ignacio, a young boy with a beautiful singing voice, is an object of lust from Father Manolo, the school principal and literature teacher.

Enrique wants to adapt Ignacio’s story into a movie. But Ángel's condition is that he play the part of Zahara, the transgender lead. However, Enrique is skeptical. He feels the Ignacio he loved and the Ignacio of today are totally different people. He (Enrique) drives to Galicia. That's when he learns from Ignacio's mother that the real Ignacio has been dead for four years. He also learns that the man who came to his office is Ignacio's younger brother Juan.

In the book, it is said that Enrique releases his movie later and has great success. Despite the grief and guilt of his brother, Juan also has success.


"Bad Education" was given an NC-17 rating for "a scene of explicit sexual content". A special edition R-rated version was released later.

A "New York Times" reporter said that Gael García Bernal had a bad time with the movie director over the movie's content. Bernal defiantly wrote in response nothing could be further from the truth.

The movie opened at the 57th Cannes Film Festival. It was the first Spanish movie to do this.

The movie opened in theaters in the United States on November 19, 2004. It made USD $147,370 in its opening weekend.

The movie's budget was near $5 million.

The movie received very good reviews by movie critics. Rotten Tomatoes rates "Bad Education" at 88%. On the Metacritic, the movie is rated at 88 out of 100, meaning "universal acclaim".

Tokyo subway sarin attack

The Tokyo subway sarin attack ( was an act of domestic terrorism on 20 March 1995, in Tokyo, Japan, by members of the cult movement Aum Shinrikyo. 13 people were killed. 

The group had already carried out several assassinations and terrorist attacks using sarin, including the Matsumoto sarin attack nine months earlier. They had also produced several other nerve agents, including VX. The cult had attempted to produce botulinum toxin and had perpetrated several failed acts of bioterrorism.

In the raid following the attack, police arrested many senior members of the cult. Police activity continued throughout the summer, eventually arresting over 200 members, including Asahara himself. Thirteen of the senior Aum management have been sentenced to death, with many others given prison sentences up to life. Leader Shoko Asahara was executed in July 2018.

Signal recognition particle

The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a common molecule found in cytoplasm. It is a "ribonucleoprotein" (a protein-RNA complex). It recognizes and targets specific proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes and the plasma membrane of prokaryotes.

When the SRP-ribosome complex binds to a cell membrane receptor, SRP releases the ribosome and drifts away. The ribosome resumes protein synthesis, but now the protein is moving through the SRP-receptor transmembrane pore. So, SRP directs the movement of proteins within the cell. It binds with a transmembrane pore. This allows the protein to cross the membrane to where it is needed. In eukaryotes, the target is the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

The SRP is 'universally conserved'. That means it is so important that "all living things have it in their cells". Despite this, the actual composition of the SRP varies greatly between organisms.

General Secretary Xi Jinping important speech series

Counterintelligence

Counterintelligence is an activity to protect a state against spies and other activities of a foreign intelligence service.

It includes "protecting an agency's intelligence program against an opposition's intelligence service". It refers to information gathered and steps taken to counter espionage. Other intelligence activities are taken to prevent sabotage, or assassinations by foreign powers, organizations or persons. Activities are taken against international terrorist groups and personnel. Work is done on physical, document or communications security programs.

Often counterintelligence at home is done by a different department from gathering intelligence abroad. For example, in the United Kingdom, there is a distinction between the Security Service (MI5) and the Special Branch of the Metropolitan Police. Arrests and interrogation is done by Special Branch. Gathering intelligence abroad is done by MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service.

In theory, the USA has a similar division between foreign activities and homeland activities. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is a domestic security service. The CIA has no law enforcement function and does overseas intelligence gathering, with only limited domestic intelligence collection. In practice, the set-up is much more complex, and ever-changing. For one thing, the career of James Angleton and also the Watergate scandal shows how the CIA has been involved in mainland USA. The addition of the United States Department of Homeland Security was a recognition that the United States was itself a potential target of attack by its various enemies.

Russia may have been the first country to set up an official counterintelligence organisation: the Okhrana was set up in 1880. Its title 'Department for Protecting the Public Security and Order'. sounds very modern. There was an even earlier Russian security department called the 'Department on Protecting the Order and Public Peace'. It was founded in 1866. It would be fair to say that these Russian organisations were not directed towards foreign intelligence services, but against internal threats to public order. They were part of the MVD (Ministry of the Interior).

The Great Stupa at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone structures in India. It is an important monument of Indian Architecture. The emperor Ashoka ordered it to be built,in the 3rd century BCE. Its center was a simple dome-like brick structure built over the relics of the Buddha. It was crowned by the "chatra", a parasol-like structure symbolising high rank. This structure was intended to honour and shelter the relics. The original construction work of this stupa was overseen by Ashoka, whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant of nearby Vidisha. Sanchi was Devi's birthplace as well as the place of her wedding with Ashoka. In the 1st century BCE, four elaborately carved toranas (ornamental gateways) and a balustrade encircling the entire structure were added. The Sanchi Stupa built during Mauryan period was made of bricks. The composite flourished until the 11th century.

Alcubierre drive

The Alcubierre drive or Alcubierre warp drive is an idea for a faster-than-light travel engine. The Mexican theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre created this idea using Albert Einstein's field equations in general relativity. The main principle of this idea is by creating an energy-density field lower than that of a vacuum (that is, negative mass) to make the space in front of the ship contract and the space behind the ship expand. In theory, this would create a bubble in space-time around the craft, allowing it to stay still while the space around it moves. This would effectively avoid breaking Einstein's rule that no object in our universe may go as fast or faster than the speed of light, while still allowing an object to go to another very distant part of space much faster than light.

UEFA Euro 2024

The 2024 UEFA European Football Championship, also known as UEFA Euro 2024 or simply Euro 2024, will be the 17th edition of the UEFA European Championship. Germany will host the tournament. It is scheduled from 14 June to 14 July 2024.
It would be the third time that the matches are played on German territory and the second time in reunified Germany. The former West Germany hosted the tournament of 1988. Four matches of the multi-national Euro 2020 were played in Munich.

However, it would be the first time the match is held in the former East Germany with Leipzig as a host city.

Italy are the defending champions going into the tournament. They have beaten England on penalties in the 2020 final.

On 8 March 2017, UEFA announced that only two countries, Germany and Turkey, had announced their intentions to host the tournament before the deadline of 3 March 2017.

The host was selected on 27 September 2018 in Nyon, Switzerland.

The UEFA Executive Committee voted for the host in a secret ballot, with only a simple majority (more than half of the valid votes) required to determine the host. In the event of a tie, the UEFA President would cast the decisive vote. Of the twenty members of the Executive Committee, two were ineligible to vote and one was not there, leaving a total of seventeen voting members.

As hosts, Germany qualified for the tournament automatically. The 23 remaining spots will be determined through qualifying, with the group stage taking place from March to November 2023, and the play-offs linked with the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League in March 2024. The qualifying draw is expected to take place in Hamburg in December 2022.

Germany had a wide choice of stadia that satisfied UEFA's minimum capacity requirement of 30,000 seats for European Championship matches.

Nine venues used at the 2006 FIFA World Cup were selected: Berlin, Dortmund, Munich, Cologne, Stuttgart, Hamburg, Leipzig, Frankfurt and Gelsenkirchen. Düsseldorf, which was not used in 2006 but had previously been used for the 1974 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 1988, will serve as a 10th venue; conversely, Hanover, Nuremberg and Kaiserslautern, host cities in 2006, will not be used for this championship.

Many other stadiums, such as those in Bremen and Mönchengladbach were not selected. The venues covered all the main regions of Germany, but the area with the highest number of venues at UEFA Euro 2024 is the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, with four of the 10 host cities (Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Gelsenkirchen and Cologne).

The final tournament draw will take place in December 2023 at the "Elbphilharmonie" in Hamburg. The format used in 2016 and 2020 will be used again.

The International Broadcast Centre (IBC) will be located at the halls of the Leipzig Trade Fair in Leipzig, Germany.

2026 FIFA World Cup

The 2026 FIFA World Cup, also called FIFA World Cup 26, will be the 23rd edition. It takes place from June to July 19, 2026, hosted by 16 cities in Canada, Mexico, and the United States – the first World Cup with three hosts. Argentina is the current champion. This tournament includes 48 teams, up from 32, and was won by the United States over Morocco. It's the first multi-nation World Cup since 2002. Mexico has hosted twice before, while it's Canada's first time. The event returns to its traditional summer schedule, unlike the 2022 World Cup in Qatar held in November and December.

The United Bid expected all three host countries to get automatic World Cup spots. FIFA President Gianni Infantino confirmed this on August 31, 2022, with Canada, Mexico, and the United States securing spots as hosts. The FIFA Council officially confirmed this on February 14, 2023. Before the 67th FIFA Congress, the FIFA Council met in Manama, Bahrain, and approved the slot allocation. This includes a playoff tournament with six teams to decide the final two World Cup spots.

In the playoffs, there will be one team from each confederation except UEFA, and an extra team from the host countries' confederation, CONCACAF. Two seeded teams (based on World Rankings) will face off against the winners of two knockout games between the unseeded teams. These matches will take place in one or more of the host countries and serve as a test event for the World Cup. This allocation also ensures that the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) gets a guaranteed spot in the tournament for the first time. So, the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the first where all six confederations have at least one guaranteed spot, and all continents will have teams in the finals for the first time since 2010.

2016 Austrian presidential election

Presidential elections were held in Austria on 24 April 2016, with a second round run-off on 22 May 2016. However, the results of the second round were annulled and a re-vote took place on 4 December 2016.

The President of Austria is directly elected by the people once every six years. The election is held under a two-round system; if no candidate receives more than 50% of votes cast in the first round, then a second ballot occurs in which only those two candidates who received the greatest number of votes in the first round may stand. 

Incumbent President Heinz Fischer had served two terms and was not eligible to be elected for a third successive term. 

In the first round of the election, Norbert Hofer of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) received the most votes. Alexander Van der Bellen, a member of the Austrian Greens ran as an independent, placed second. Since no candidate received a majority of the vote, Hofer and Van der Bellen went head-to-head in the second round in May. This was the first time since World War II that an Austrian president had not been backed by either the People's or the Social Democratic party. During the run-off, Van der Bellen defeated Hofer on 23 May 2016 after the postal ballots had been counted.

On 22 July, the results of the second round of voting were annulled after the results in 20 of the 117 administrative districts were challenged, and the Constitutional Court of Austria found that Austrian electoral law had been disregarded in 14 of them. The Court found that over 77,900 absentee votes were counted too early, however without any signs of votes having been cheated. The second round re-vote was planned on 2 October, but was postponed to 4 December 2016.

Van der Bellen ultimately won the second round re-vote with 53.8% of the vote and a voter turnout of 74.2%. Hofer announced his defeat in the race to Van der Bellen when the result had become apparent shortly after polls closed. Van der Bellen was sworn in as the twelfth president of Austria on 26 January 2017.

Hofer was a candidate for President of Austria in the 2016 election. He received the plurality of votes, 35% as opposed to 21% of rival Alexander Van der Bellen, in the first round. The much closer results of the second round of voting (49.7%/50.3%) were annulled by the Constitutional Court due to voting irregularities affecting nearly 78,000 votes, requiring the election to be re-held. In the re-run on 4 December 2016 he received 46% of the vote and lost the election to Van der Bellen.

In 1891, 99 locomotives, 181 carriages and 1493 wagons were built.
In 1957, the last of over two thousand steam locomotives was built. Carriage building finished in 1962. The works was modernised with the addition of a diesel locomotive repair shop.

Italian Mogadiscio

Mogadiscio was the name of Mogadishu, capital of Somalia, when was under Italy's rule from 1905 until 1947. The Italian influence in Mogadishu lasted 80 years, from 1880 until 1960, when the city grew from a small city of just two thousand inhabitants to a metropolis of nearly half a million "mogadiscians" in the metropolitan area.

The ancient city of Mogadishu was under Italian colonial rule/influence for nearly seventy years, from the 1880s until after the end of WW2. In 1905 was declared capital of the newly created "Somalia Italiana".

The first Italian to write about Mogadiscio was Marco Polo, who knew of the city during his merchant travels in Asia. But only in the late XIX century the commerce company "Filonardi" from Italy took control of facilities in the port of Mogadishu.

By 1882, Mogadishu was under the joint control of the Somali Geledi Sultanate (which was also holding sway over the Shebelle Valley region in the interior called Benadir) and the Omani Sultan of Zanzibar. In 1885, Ali bin Said leased the city to an Italian chartered company owned by Vincenzo Filonardi. This "Compagnia Filonardi" (1893-96) and later the "Società Anonima Commerciale Italiana del Benadir" (1899-1905) was finally taken by the Italian government, that obtained the control of the entire region of Benadir with the port of Mogadishu through an agreement with the British government in 1892. From 3 August 1889 to 15 May 1893 Filonardi was the first Governor of the "Somalia italiana" (he was governor again from 1896 to 1897).

The Kingdom of Italy purchased the city in 1905 and made Mogadishu the capital of the newly established Italian Somaliland. The Italians subsequently referred to the city as "Mogadiscio".

The city was soon modernized in the early 1910s with the creation of the first sewage system, the first hospital, the first paved roads and the new electricity facilities. In the 1920s the Italians created the first airport and enlarged the "Port of Mogadishu".

From 5 April 1908 to 5 May 1936, the Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops ("Regio corpo truppe coloniali della Somalia Italiana"), originally called the "Guard Corps of Benadir", served as the territory's formal military corps with headquarters in Mogadiscio. At the start of its establishment, the force had 2,600 Italian officers. Between 1911 and 1912, over 1,000 Somalis from Mogadishu served as combat units along with Eritrean and Italian soldiers in the Italo-Turkish War. Most of the troops stationed never returned home until they were transferred back to Italian Somaliland in preparation for the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935.
In November 1920, the Banca d'Italia, the first modern bank in Italian Somaliland, was established in Mogadishu.

On December 5, 1923, Cesare Maria De Vecchi was named Governor in charge of the new colonial administration and promoted the process of complete pacification of the Somalia italiana, with the initial integration of the native population. Italian colonial policy followed two principles in Italian Somaliland: preservation of the dominant clan and ethnic configurations and respect for Islam as the territory's religion.

In 1928, the Italian authorities built the Mogadishu Cathedral ("Cattedrale di Mogadiscio"). It was constructed in a Norman Gothic style, based on the Cefalù Cathedral in Cefalù, Sicily. Following its establishment, Crown Prince Umberto II of Italy made his first publicized visit to Mogadishu. To commemorate the visit, the Arch of Umberto was constructed. The arch was built at the center of Mogadishu Garden. The Mogadishu International Airport was constructed that same year. The facility was regarded as one of the finest in the region.

In the early 1930s, the new Italian Governors, Guido Corni and Maurizio Rava, started a policy of full assimilation of the Somalis. Many Somalis were enrolled in the Italian colonial troops, and thousands of Italian colonists moved to live in Mogadishu. The city grew in size and some small manufacturing companies opened up. The Italians also settled in agricultural areas around the capital, such as Jowhar and Janale ("Genale").

It is noteworthy to pinpoint that "Mogadiscio" was the only name of Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, when was officially under Italy's rule from 1905 until February 1947. The only official language in those years was the Italian language.
In 1930, there were 22,000 Italians living in Italian Somaliland, representing 2% of the territory's population. The majority resided in the capital Mogadishu, with other Italian communities concentrated in Jowhar ("Villabruzzi"), Adale ("Itala"), Janale ("Genale"), Jamame and Kismayo. In the mid' 1930s the Italian community of Mogadishu started the first football championships in Somalia: their main team was AC Mogadiscio.

By 1935, Mogadishu began to serve as a major naval base and port for the Italians. Then Prime Minister of Italy Benito Mussolini regarded Greater Somalia ("La Grande Somalia") with capital Mogadiscio as the crown jewel in Italy's colonial empire in eastern Africa. Consequently, from 1936 to 1940, new roads were constructed in the region around Mogadiscio, such as the "Imperial Road" from Mogadishu to Addis Abeba. New railways (114 km from Mogadishu to Jowhar) and many schools, hospitals, ports and bridges were also built.
In March 1941 Mogadiscio was occupied by the British Army. Because of security reasons, nearly all the Italians of Somalia moved to live in Mogadiscio, so consequently in 1942 it was a city where the Italians were nearly half the population and where the Catholicism was the religion of nearly 60% of the inhabitants. According to reports of the British authorities, Mogadiscio in 1942 looked mostly like an european city (nicknamed "the white pearl of the Indian Ocean").

After WW2, in February 1947 the Italian government signed the Peace Treaty (surrendering all colonies) and "Italian Mogadiscio" ceased to exist.
In 1950 the Italians returned to rule the city under mandate of the ONU for another ten years until 1960, when was declared the independence of Somalia. In the 10 years of the Italian mandate the country experience huge improvements, from economy and education to sports (for example with the creation of the first football teams, like the Genio Officina and the AC Mogadiscio. Furthermore, the first university in Somalia was created in the same years, with courses linked to the Italian university of Rome.

Gloria al Bravo Pueblo

"Glory to the Brave People" is the national anthem of Venezuela. A President of Venezuela, Antonio Guzmán Blanco, made it the country's national anthem on May 25, 1881. A while before that, lyrics and music were made for it. The words of the song were written by a journalist named Vicente Salias in 1810, and the melody for his words was later composed by a musician named Juan José Landaeta. It is said, however, that the melody has been known since 1840 as "The Venezuelan Marseillaise", in reference the French national anthem.

Some recent investigations have suggested that the real author of the anthem was Andrés Bello, and not Salias, to whom it was originally credited, and the music was composed by another musician named Lino Gallardo. However, this theory has yet to be proven, and lacks any real recognition among the general Venezuelan population, historians, or otherwise.

Venezuela also has a flag anthem, titled "Himno a la Bandera de Venezuela".

The Venezuelan national anthem is played every day on radio and television broadcasts at 12:00 am, 6:00 am and 12:00 pm (either the full version or the chorus, first stanza and chorus) on all national TV networks. On radio broadcasts, the state anthem is played after the national anthem, which is also the case in state TV stations. 

In most occasions, only the chorus, first stanza and the chorus are played or even the chorus itself. Sometimes the chorus is played twice in the beginning, and once in the rest of the anthem. In formal events (if the anthem will be played by either a military band, concert band or orchestra) the format is: Chorus (2x), First verse and Chorus (2x), with the optional introduction. If played in full the chorus is sung twice, with or without the introductiory notes.

Around 3.57 million people were registered to vote in the election, with 2.63 million (79.8%) turning out. Advance voting proved popular, with 1.24 million votes cast before election day, more than the previous two elections combined.

Dervish movement (Somali)

The Somali Dervish movement (Somali: Halgankii Daraawiishta) was a popular movement that developed in Somaliland between 1899 and 1920.
It called for the expulsion of all foreign powers from the Somaliland region in the Horn of Africa. 

It was led by the Salihiyya Sufi Muslim poet and militant leader Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, also known as Sayyid Mohamed. He called for the removal of British and Italian colonies in Somalia, the defeat of Ethiopian forces, the expulsion of Christianity and the establishment of a Muslim Somali state.

On 3 March 1905 Hassan, the so-called "Mad Mullah" declared himself "Sayyid" of Nogal (Nugaal valley) in the Khatumo region. The territory coincided approximately with the actual Nugaal area in modern Khatumo State. It was ruled like a kind of sultanate on behalf of the Mahdi.

Hassan's rule was ended by Italy in 1911. After the collapse of Hassan’s resistance movement, rebellion and revolt occurred with disputes between different tribes in Northern Somalia.

The Italian government of Somalia again worked together with the old tribesmen in order to try and keep peace between the several tribes, while maintaining close control over the military.

Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan (nicknamed the "Mad Mullah" by the British) escaped from the Khatumo region in 1920 to Imey Ethiopia, where he later died in 1921.

The Dervish legacy in Somalia and Somaliland has been influential. It was the "most important revivalist Islamic movements" in Somalia, state Hasan and Robleh. The movement, and particularly its leader, has been controversial in Somalia. Some cherish it as the founder of modern Somali nationalism. Others see it as an ambitious Muslim brotherhood militancy that destroyed Somalia's opportunity to move towards modernization and progress in favor of a puritanical Islamic state embedded with Islamic education. Its ideas are enshrined in the constitution of Somalia.

The town is about southwest of Northampton and about northwest of Milton Keynes, the nearest main towns.

The name comes from the Latin for "Camp on the (river) Tove".

Towcester is famous for its racecourse. Many important national horse racing events are held there. Greyhound racing is also held at the same venue. In 2010 the World Hovercraft Championship was held on the racecourse.
Nearby is the Silverstone motor racing circuit, currently home to the British Grand Prix. In fiction the "Saracen's Head Inn" in Towcester features in Charles Dickens's novel "The Pickwick Papers" as one of Mr Pickwick's stopping places along what is now the A5 trunk road. 

Towcester may be the oldest town in Northamptonshire. There are Iron Age finds in the town, so it is one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements in the country. There is evidence that it was settled by humans since the Mesolithic era (middle stone age). There is also evidence of Iron Age burials in the area.

In Roman Britain, Watling Street, now the A5 road, was built through the area. A garrison town called "Lactodurum" was built. Two candidate sites for the Battle of Watling Street, fought in 61 AD, are close to the town. 

When the Romans left in the 5th century, the area was settled by Saxons. In the 9th century, Watling Street became the frontier between the kingdom of Wessex and the Danelaw, so Towcester became a frontier town. Edward the Elder fortified Towcester in 917. In the 11th century, the Normans built a motte and bailey castle on the site. Bury Mount are the remains of the fortification and is a scheduled ancient monument. It was renovated in 2008 with an access ramp added and explanatory plaques added.

Whirligig beetle

The whirligig beetles are a family (Gyrinidae) of water beetles that swim on the surface of fresh water.

They usually swim on the surface of the water if undisturbed, though they go underwater when threatened. They swim rapidly in circles when alarmed. They have divided eyes which may allow them to see above and below water at the same time. 

The family includes some 700 living species worldwide, in 15 genera, plus a few fossil species. Most species are very similar in appearance, though they vary in size from 3 mm to 18 mm in length. They tend to be flattened and rounded. Their shape is a good approximation to an ellipsoid, with legs and other appendages fitting closely into a streamlined surface.

Both larvae and adults are active predators. The adults carry an air bubble under their elytra, and can submerge for long periods if they want to. Mostly they move around on the surface in groups.

They are also very versatile in water moving at a staggering 100 body lengths per second.

Test data

Test data is the data that is used in tests of a software system.

In order to test a software application you need to enter some data for testing most of the features. Any such specifically identified data which is used in tests is known as test data.

Some test data is used to confirm the expected result, i.e. when test data is entered the expected result should come and some test data is used to verify the software behaviour to invalid input data.

Battle of Jutland

The Battle of Jutland was the most important naval battle during World War I.

The German fleet was under blockade by the larger Royal Navy of Britain and, for the most part, was kept in its base at Wilhelmshaven. The Battle of Jutland happened when the German Navy, led by Admiral Reinhard Scheer, tried to break out into the open sea. The German fleet consisted of 22 battleships, five battlecruisers, 11 cruisers and 61 torpedo boats. Scheer also had submarines with torpedos, which he arranged outside the main British bases.

The main British bases were in Scotland: the Orkney and Shetland Islands had a huge base at Scapa Flow, and bases on the main island were at Cromarty, on the Moray Firth, and at Rosyth, on the north bank of the Firth of Forth.

The British fleet steamed south-east from their bases and met the German Navy, which was steaming due north. The battle was fought over a wide area at Jutland Bank, west of the Skagerrak, between Norway and Denmark.

Scapa Flow is a long way from the Skagerrak, but the British fleet still knew about of the German ship movements. The British had cracked the German cipher, and when Scheer gave the order to sail, the Admiralty in London gave the Grand Fleet orders to sail from Orkney. 

That was because the British had gotten hold of three codebooks from wrecked ships. One code, for smaller vessels, was from a German freighter. Another, for diplomatic messages, was taken from a wreck on the bottom of the North Sea. The code for the German High Seas Fleet was from a cruiser that was wrecked in the Baltic. The British did not make the best use of thse sources, but they had in their hands a priceless advantage.

The first group of British ships to make contact were those from the Firth of Forth, commanded by Vice-Admiral David Beatty. He had six battlecruisers and four fast battleships, which got through the submarine cordon outside the Firth of Forth with no casualties. 

Beatty's battlecruiser group met the German battlecruiser force, led by Rear-Admiral Franz Hipper. The German advantage in range-finding, with better optics, was important, but the British cruisers were saved by the arrival of the four battleships. Since the battleships were better in both armor and firepower, Hipper was forced to turn away from the east and the main German force of battleships.

Finally, late in the day. the Grand Fleet from Scapa Flow, led by Admiral John Jellicoe, met the main German force of battleships, led by Scheer: "To Scheer's range-takers... the entire arc stretching from the north to the east was a sea of fire". After ten minutes, Scheer signaled a simultaneous turnaway.

Also, 21 torpedos caused Jellico to turn away, and Scheer put 10 miles between the British battleships and himself. As darkness grew, there were a few more encounters until the German fleet managed to make it home. The Germans had sunk more ships, but the balance of power had not changed since since the British still controlled the seas..

Clearing bank

A clearing bank is one which moves money between accounts, and issues money to customers. At one time this meant taking in and giving out actual money. Now it means any kind of financial transaction.

In banking and finance, clearing means all activities from the time a commitment is made for a transaction until it is settled. This process turns the promise of payment (for example, in the form of a cheque or electronic payment request) into the actual movement of money from one account to another. 

In the UK they are officially called a Cheque and Credit Clearing Company. In the United States the Federal Reserve performs an intermediary role, clearing and settling international bank payments.

Significant other

Significant other (SO) is way of saying a person has a close relationship. Deliberately, it does not say what the relationship is.

It refers to a person's partner, but says nothing about marital status, relationship status, or sexual orientation. Similar terms, but more specific, are: sweetheart, better half, spouse, domestic partner, lover, soulmate, or life partner.

The term is now often used in invitations, such as to weddings and office parties. In correspondence from hospitals, for example, "you may be accompanied for your appointment by a significant other". "Relevant other" is another ways of saying the same thing. "Significant others" is sometimes used.

Also, in psychology, psychiatry and sociology, it may mean someone who has a big influence on the person.

The first known use of the term was in the U.S.

Le Locle

Le Locle is a municipality of the district of Le Locle in the canton of Neuchâtel in Switzerland.

It is in the Jura Mountains, a few kilometers from the city of La Chaux-de-Fonds. It is the third smallest city of Switzerland. As of 31 December 2016, Le Locle has about 10,000 people lived there.

The name of the town comes from the word for "lake" or "trou d´eau".

Since 2009, it is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site: La Chaux-de-Fonds/Le Locle, Watchmaking Town Planning.

Le Locle is on the Swiss side of the mountain pass Col des Roches, which forms the border between France and Switzerland.

Le Locle is first mentioned in 1332 as "dou Locle".

The earliest traces of human settlements come from the end of the Mesolithic period (6000-5000 BC) in shelter in the Col des Roches. The site includes the oldest pottery found in the Canton of Neuchâtel, along with many tools, the molar of a mammoth and deer and wild boar bones. The shelter was discovered in 1926 by a customs official and was the first site of its kind studied in Switzerland.

However, between 4000 BC and the Middle Ages nothing is known about the Le Locle area.

In 1150 the valley, in which Le Locle would later be built, was granted by Renaud and William Valanginian to the abbey of Fontaine-André. In 1360, John II of Aarberg, the Lord of Valanginian, received Le Locle as a fief from Count Louis of Neuchatel. The heavily wooded part of the Jura Mountains around Le Locle, were cleared by colonists who later received the status of free peasants. These first free farmers received a charter in 1372 which codified their rights and freedoms. At the beginning of the 15th century, this charter was reconfirmed during the foundation of the Mairie or town government. Beginning in the 14th century Le Locle and La Sagne formed a parish together. The church of Mary Magdalene in Le Locle was built in 1351.

The tower of the church of Mary Magdalene, the landmark of the city, arose early in the 16th century. A few years after the tower was built, in 1536, Le Locle converted to the protestant faith. This old church was rebuilt in the mid-18th century. A german church was built in 1844, but demolished in 1967. The Catholic chapel was built in 1861.

Le Locle was repeatedly burned by large fires (1683, 1765, 1833). It was rebuilt to its present appearance in the second quarter of the 19th century, as it became a center of the watch industry. In 1848 it became a district capital.

Because the small Bied river often flooded the valley, a channel was cut through the valley to the Col des Roches at the beginning of the 19th century. Until 1898 the river was used to provide power for several underground mills.

On 1 January 2021, Les Brenets became a part of Le Locle.

Le Locle is known as a center of Swiss watchmaking industry.

Le Locle is twinned with:


Bermondsey

Deptford

Deptford ( ) is a district of south-east London, England, within the London Borough of Lewisham. From the middle of the 16th century to the late 19th century, Deptford was home to Deptford Dockyard which was the first Royal Navy dockyard. The area declined as the Royal Navy moved out and commercial docks closed. The last dock, Convoys Wharf, closed in the year 2000.

Limehouse

Limehouse is an area of East London, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It is east of Charing Cross. It is on the northern bank of the River Thames. 

Stepney

Stepney is a district of London, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.
The modern district grew out of a medieval village around St Dunstan's church and the 15th century Mile End Road.

The area built up rapidly in the 19th century. It was mainly for immigrant workers and displaced poor people. It had a reputation for poverty, overcrowding, violence and political dissent. It was severely damaged during the Blitz in World War II. Over one third of the housing was totally destroyed. In the 1960s, slum clearance and development replaced most old residential streets with tower blocks and modern housing estates. Some Georgian architecture and Victorian era terraced housing survive. Examples include Arbour Square, the eastern side of Stepney Green, and the streets around Matlock Street.

High-rise building

A high-rise building is a tall building. It is used as an apartment building, office building or other functions, such as hotel or retail. Sometimes, multiple purposes are combined. A residential high-rise building is also called a tower block or an "MDU", standing for "Multi Dwelling Unit". A very tall high-rise building is called a skyscraper.

High-rise buildings became possible with the invention of the elevator (lift) and cheaper and more abundant building materials. The materials used for high-rise buildings are reinforced concrete and steel. Most North American style skyscrapers have a steel frame, while residential blocks are usually constructed of concrete. There is no clear difference between a tower block and a skyscraper but a building with fifty or more stories is generally considered a skyscraper. The opposite of high-rise is a low-rise building and in the middle are mid-rise buildings.

Mile End

Mile End is an area in London, England. It is in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It is east-northeast of Charing Cross. Mile End had a population of 28,544 in 2011.

The area takes its name from a historic stretch of riverside wall built along an outside curve of the River Thames, to protect the area from flooding. Blackwall today is mostly residential but Blackwall Yard provides moorings for boats.

East India Docks

The East India Docks were a group of docks in Blackwall, East London, England, north-east of the Isle of Dogs. Today only the entrance basin and the perimeter wall are still visible. The dock Basin was gradually extended and new locks built, but the 20th century saw the decline of the London docklands and the East India Docks closed in 1967. The Basin was turned into a nature reserve by the London Docklands Development Corporation and has been in the ownership of Lee Valley Regional Park Authority since 1998.

Following the successful creation of the West India Docks, which opened in 1802, an Act of Parliament in 1803 set up The East India Dock Company, promoted by the British East India Company.

Industrial waste

Industrial waste is the waste produced by industrial activity, such as that of factories, mills and mines. It is often dangerous to the environment. There are many types of industrial waste, such as gravel, scrap metal, oils, solvents, and scrap lumber. Industrial wastes are classified in many different ways, and each type of waste has to be discarded in a certain way.

There are two primary types of industrial waste. "Hazardous" waste, which is dangerous to people, animals, or the environment, and "non-hazardous" waste, which does not pose a direct danger to people, animals, or the environment. Hazardous industrial waste requires special treatment, as it can pose a great danger to living organisms. These wastes can be further classified by their state, as some waste is in solid form, but other waste is dissolved or in liquid form. These types of waste need to be treated differently.

Many large factories are near bodies of water, because they need a lot of water for cooling equipment or manufacturing. In many areas, polluted water is released back into these bodies of water, resulting in ecological damage (damage to the environment). Toxins from wastewater can kill plants and animals, and chemicals in wastewater can effect ecosystems a lot.

Solid waste typically refers to "non-hazardous" material, but some solid wastes are more harmful to the environment than others. Solid wastes are often stored in landfills, which can have a negative impact on the ecosystem, even if the waste isn't toxic.

Greenwich station

Greenwich station is about 400 metres south-west of Greenwich town centre, in London, England. It is an interchange between National Rail and the Docklands Light Railway. It is in Travelcard Zones 2 and 3.

TfL Rail

TfL Rail is a metro service operated by MTR Corporation under contract to Transport for London (TfL).

In May 2015, TfL Rail took control of the commuter service between in central London and in Essex. This branch comprises the first 14 stations on the Great Eastern Main Line. There is an interchange at Shenfield for medium- and long-distance services to East Anglia.

On 20 May 2018 TfL Rail took over operation of the Heathrow Connect service between in central London and Heathrow Airport to the west. This route has nine stations.

In December 2018, the two TfL Rail routes will merge with Crossrail to form the Elizabeth Line.

Crossrail

Crossrail is a railway line under development in the London area. It goes to the counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Essex, England. 

The central section between in central London and in the south-east, is open. It will later join with two existing routes operated by TfL Rail to become the Elizabeth Line, named after Queen Elizabeth II. 

TfL Rail's Shenfield branch is connected to Paddington and the branches west of Paddington are connected to Crossrail's central core. This completes a new east–west route across London. It will provide a new high-frequency commuter and suburban passenger service.

Basically, it is an additional NE to SW connection, ending up in Heathrow. Previously, it has been difficult to get to and fro between N.E. London and Heathrow, so this will help that journey.

Elizabeth line

The Elizabeth line is a high-frequency hybrid commuter rail and rapid transit service in London and its suburbs. The service is named after Queen Elizabeth II, who officially opened the line on 17 May 2022 during her Platinum Jubilee year; passenger services started on 24 May 2022.

Under the project name of Crossrail, the system was approved in 2007, and construction began in 2009. Originally planned to open in 2018, the project was repeatedly delayed, including for several months as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Elizabeth line uses a new tube tunnel cut through the North London chalk especially for the NE to SW commuters. That direction was favoured because it was especially difficult to get to Heathrow from the north-west of London. The tunnelling is new, but the line links up with older tube stations en route

Great Eastern Main Line

The Great Eastern Main Line (also called the East Anglia Main Line) is a main railway line in England. It connects Liverpool Street station in central London with destinations in East London and the East of England. These include Shenfield, Chelmsford, Colchester, , and Norwich. Branch lines connect the main line to Southminster, Braintree, , Harwich, and a number of coastal towns including Southend-on-Sea, Clacton-on-Sea, Walton-on-the-Naze and .

Shenfield

Shenfield is part of the conurbation of Brentwood, Essex, England. The original town centre is located one mile (1.6 km) north-east of the centre of Brentwood. There are some small industrial areas and a modest, but busy, shopping area. Shenfield serves predominantly as a dormitory town for commuters to London and surrounding towns such as Romford and Basildon. This is facilitated by easy access to the A12 Road, the M25 motorway and rail services on the Great Eastern Main Line.

London and Blackwall Railway

Droughts in the United States

Droughts in the United States is similar to drought around other parts of the world. Below-normal precipitation leads to drought. That's caused by an above average persistence of high pressure over a dry area.

Drought in the United States occurs during climate cycles, such as the North Atlantic oscillation, Atlantic multidecadal oscillation and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. These determine what areas are more likely to have development of drought and when drought develops.

Droughts are periodic. They alternate with floods over a series of years.

The worst droughts in U.S. history happened in the 1930s and 1950s. The U.S. drought in the 1930s was called the Dust Bowl. The 1936 North American heat wave was part of the Dust Bowl.

Other major droughts in the 20th and 21st centuries happened in the United States in the 1960s, 1980, 1983, 1988-90, 2002 and 2012-14.

The costliest drought in United States history was the 1988-90 drought. The drought caused just over $60 billion in damage. During the drought, there were also heat waves that took the lives of 4,800-17,000 people in the U.S. This drought was also the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history before Hurricane Katrina.

Droughts can affect anywhere within the United States. But the Midwest, Great Plains and Western United States are most likely to be affected by droughts.

Unbinilium

Unbinilium is a hypothetical (theoretical or imagined) element of the periodic table. It is also known as eka- radium. Its atomic number should be 120 and is has the symbol Ubn. The name Unbinilium and the symbol Ubn are temporary IUPAC names (meaning "one-two-zero-ium" in Latin). This name and symbol exists until a permanent name is decided and the element is discovered. It is expected to be a s-block element and an alkaline earth metal. It is the second element in the eighth period of the periodic table.

This element has not been synthesized (obtained or discovered) yet. A German team at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research attempted a research on 2011. It suggested a possible production of Ubn. But it couldn't be done. Attempts were planned by the Russian, Japanese, and French teams. Attempts were made in 2017-2020 and the experiments from the attempts showed that 8th period elements were difficult to synthesize. Unbinilium is expected to be the last element that can be synthesized through current technology.

As of November 2022, it has yet to be created and currently has no uses.

Violence against women

Violence against women (VAW in short), also called gender-based violence, is violent acts mostly against women and girls. It is sometimes considered a hate crime. The reason for that is such acts of violence are done against women and girls mainly because they're female.

The United Nations' Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women says: "violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power of relations between men and women."

Violence against women has several broad categories: rape, sexual harassment, domestic violence, sexual violence, forced marriage and female genital mutilation are among those categories.

On 11 May 2011, Council of Europe has adopted Istanbul Convention against domestic violence and violence against women.


Vacation

A vacation (American English) or holiday (British English) is a time for people to relax and take a break from whatever they usually do. People spend their vacation time in different ways. For many, it's a time for tourism. They might go backpacking to a holiday camp, or stay in a trailer, hostel, or hotel. Families often take a vacation together. Because the cost of many things is becoming higher, some people are giving up going on vacation to other countries, and are staying in their home country and finding interesting places to go there. This type of trip is known colloquially as a "staycation".

Vacations are usually taken when somebody has time off of work or school. This means that many people go on vacation during religious or national holidays. Many jobs allow for workers to have several days off during which they will still be paid. This practice, known as annual leave, is another common time for people to go on vacation.

Indigenous marriage in South Africa

Indigenous marriage in South Africa is a social and legal bond between two clans. This bond is built around a man and a woman in a ukulobola covenant. The delivery of ikhazi things like cattle or other valuables from the man’s family to the woman’s. This bond connects the two clans in a permanent relationship. Children the man and woman have make the bond stronger. 

The wife gets transferred from her clan where she enjoyed her maiden status as a princess inkosazana to her marital home where she is elevated to the status of the queen inkosikazi of the household.

The participants, mostly high school students, competed to test their knowledge of natural sciences and mathematical sciences in the freely selected topics. The works were written in the form of graduation/diploma theses. They were then defended to the professors of the Faculty of Sciences and the Faculty of Biotechnical and Biomedical sciences, and the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Three prizes were awarded annually, in the form of books.

Bi-weekly or monthly summer schools were commonly held in historically notable cities/locations, such as Tjentište, Boračko jezero, Treskavica – Vučja Luka (Wolf Harbour) Jezero (near Jajce) and others.

While Suryavanshi Kshatriyas present across Aryavarta (Ancient India) the other prominent community from South part of India also proclaims themself as Suryavanshi Kshatriya that's Kshatriya Kula Founders from Tamilnadu. They are the descendants of Chola dynasty and Cholas have declared themself as Suryavanshi/ Raghuvanshi. The Vanniyar kula Kshatriyas are the sickle largest community in Tamilnadu however anti Hindu forces and politics have always kept this community in dark so that they don't connect with other Kshatriyas of North India. Locally they are called as Vanniyar which is originates from Vanni Tree that's Shami Vriksha in Sanskrit which is a sacred tree for Kshatriyas. Also they are called "Gounder" means Thakur in rural Tamilnadu.

Akhil Bhartiya Kshatriya Mahasabha, Karani Sena and other Kshatriya associations are actively working with South Indian Kshatriyas to unite them these days.

Chandravanshi

The term Chandravanshi refers to a person belonging to Lunar dynasty of ancient India. The Chandravanshi clan is also an ancient Kshatriya/Rajput(warrior) clan of India. They are said to be descendants from the Moon (Chandra). The Hindu God Krishna is believed to be born in the Yaduvansha branch of the Lunar dynasty.

According to the Shatapatha Brahmana, Pururavas was the son of Budha (himself often described as the son of Soma) and the gender-switching deity Ila (born as the daughter of Manu). Pururavas's great-grandson was Yayati, who had five sons named Yadu, Turvasu, Druhyu, Anu, and Puru. These seem to be the names of five Vedic tribes as described in the Vedas.

According to the Mahabharata, the dynasty's progenitor Ila ruled from Prayag, and had a son Shashabindu who ruled in the country of Bahli. The son of Ila and Budha was Pururavas who became the first Chandravanshi emperor of the planet. Ila's descendants were also known as the Ailas

In Hindu texts, the Kurukshetra war that forms the subject of the Indian Epic Mahabharata, was largely fought between rival branches of the Lunar Dynasty, famously resulting in the hesitation of Arjuna away from war and the reprimand of his mentor Krishna. Krishna reminds Arjuna that Dharma stands above everything and the text forms an integral cultural cornerstone for all four Kshatriya houses.

By the conclusion of the Kurukshetra war most of the Yadhuvanshi lineage is in peril. The sinking of Dwarka sees the destruction of the entire Yaduvanshi lineage with the exception of Vajranabh who was saved by Arjuna & later becomes the King of Mathura.

The Chandravanshi Kshatriya/Rajput clans are listed below:

Zack tries to make friends with with Laney, but she ignores him and walks away. Zack's sister Mac (Anna Paquin) tells him to try again, but to learn what Laney is interested in and cares about. Zack goes to the restaurant where Laney works, and with the help of Laney's friend, Jesse Jackson (Elden Henson) gets her to give him a chance. Laney takes him to a small theater where she will be performing in a drama show. To embarrass him, Laney has Zack called on stage to perform.

R. Lee Fleming, Jr. is credited as the only screenwriter for the movie. M. Night Shyamalan also rewrote the movie script, but was not credited. Fleming said Shyamalan wrote the line "Am I a bet?".

Director Robert Iscove wanted his movie to be like the old movies of John Hughes, but different and for the teenagers of the 1990s. 
He knew that Cook was not ugly and that audiences would have to accept the idea and pretend: "You either go along with it or you don't go along with it." He compared it to how Clark Kent changes into Superman. Instead of making a real change from ugly to pretty, he said it was more important to find an actress who could show the different changes in her personality and feelings.
Filming took place in various places in California. The highschool scenes were shot at Torrance High School, where Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Beverly Hills, 90210 had also filmed.
Iscove was also a choreographer before he was a director and wanted to include dancing in the movie. He wanted show his bosses the Weinsteins, that musical numbers could work in modern movies. The dance scene was choreographed by Adam Shankman, who later become known as a judge on the television series So You Think You Can Dance. Shankman also worked with Owen Wilson on his dance scenes.

The song "Kiss Me" was used as the main theme song for the movie. The success of the movie helped "Kiss Me" become more popular, and gain widespread mainstream attention and success in the music charts. "Kiss Me" climbed to No. 2 on Billboard's Hot 100 list, and stayed in the Top 10 for 16 weeks.

The movie was released in Italy with the title "Kiss Me".

Critics gave the movie mixed reviews. They liked the main actors but complained that the story was easy to predict and not funny enough. On Rotten Tomatoes the movie has a score of 40% based on 60 reviews. On Metacritic the movie has a score of 51% based 32 reviews.

Matthew Flinders

Matthew Flinders (16 March 1774 – 19 July 1814) was an English navigator and cartographer. He was the leader of the first circumnavigation of Australia and identified it as a continent.

Flinders made three voyages to the southern ocean between 1791 and 1810. In the second voyage, George Bass and Flinders confirmed that Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) was an island. In the third voyage, Flinders circumnavigated the mainland of what was to be called Australia, along with Aboriginal man Bungaree.

Heading back to England in 1803, Flinders' vessel needed urgent repairs at Isle de France (Mauritius). Although Britain and France were at war, Flinders thought the scientific nature of his work would ensure safe passage, but a suspicious governor kept him under arrest for more than six years. In captivity, he recorded details of his voyages for future publication, and put forward his rationale for naming the new continent 'Australia', as an umbrella term for New Holland and New South Wales – a suggestion taken up later by Governor Macquarie.

Flinders' health had suffered, however, and although he reached home in 1810, he did not live to see the publication of his widely praised book and atlas, "A Voyage to Terra Australis".

Induction coil

An induction coil or "spark coil" is a type of electrical transformer. It is used to produce high-voltage pulses from a low-voltage direct current (DC) supply. To create the flux changes necessary to induce voltage in the secondary coil, the direct current in the primary coil is repeatedly interrupted by a vibrating mechanical contact called an interrupter.

The induction coil was the first type of transformer. It was widely used in X-ray machines, spark-gap radio transmitters, arc lighting and quack medical devices from the 1880s to the 1920s. Today its only common use is for ignition coils in internal combustion engines and in physics education to demonstrate induction.

Variscan orogeny

The Variscan orogeny (Hercynian orogeny) is an ancient mountain-building event in the late Palaeozoic era. It was caused by a continental collision between Euramerica (Laurussia) and Gondwana to form the supercontinent of Pangaea.

It explains many older features of the present-day world. The Appalachians in North America and the Massif Central in France are two examples. Other examples are the Pyrenees, Sardinia, the Rhine Massif, the Anti-Atlas in Morocco. To the east, the Variscan caused the Urals, the Pamir, the Tian Shan mountains. 

This geologic mountain-building event took place mostly in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. By then Pangaea was more or less complete. In the Triassic period of the Mesozoic, there was land between Siberia over the North Pole to Antarctica over the South Pole. Later in the Mesozoic, the opening of the Atlantic split Pangea. The various parts of the huge mountain belts ended up widely apart on the modern globe.

Higher mountain chains on present-day Earth are the product of a later episode of mountain-building known as the Alpine orogeny.

It is about the lives of Radhika and Dev. It is a different story than the first season. It has a different storyline and even some characters except for Dev and Radhika which are played by Avinash Sachdev and Rubina Dilaik respectively. The show is very popular and gains good TRP with an average of 2–3.

Radhika, a Brahmin by birth, was adopted and brought up by a family of weavers in a small town. Dev visited the town with his family, met Radhika and became good friends. One day, while Radhika and Dev playing in a temple, they reached a place where 50 couples were getting married. Dev rubbed sindoor on Radhika's forehead, which she had gotten on her head by accident. This caused them to get married without their knowledge. When a priest who witnessed Dev and Radhika's "wedding" comes to Radhika's home and tells her parents that Radhika is married, Radhika tries to tell Dev this but is unable to meet him again.

One night after college, Radhika meets Dev. They spend time together but Radhika feels bad that she is attracted to someone else. Later on, she finds out that Dev is the one she had married as a child and tells him the truth. Under obligations, he tells her to marry Rohan. She tries to make him accept many times, but he refuses.
Radhika is unable to get married to Rohan after all. A fire starts and Rohan gets badly burned, though Radhika is saved. Dev meets Radhika in the hospital and asks her what caused the fire. She tells him that Rohan knows that she loves someone else; Dev gets angry at this and tells her he hates her. Radhika decides to get into their house as the "choti bahu" and wife of Dev without telling anyone so she can gain Dev's trust back.
After all the misunderstandings are cleared, the family accepts Dev and Radhika's relationship and Dev and Radhika are soon to be wed. However, because of social norms, everyone calls Radhikha an unchaste woman. To end this problem, Dadaji calls off Dev's marriage with Radikha and fixes it with Barkha. On the eve of Barkha and Dev's wedding, Barkha, wishing to help Radhika, lies to Radikha that she has told Dadaji about what happened 12 years ago and Dadaji has accepted her and will let her become Dev's wife. Radhika therefore dresses up in Barkha's wedding dress and takes the wedding vows with Dev.
After Dadaji realizes that Dev married Radikha instead of Barkha, he suffers a fatal heart attack. The Purohit family decides that Dev will pretend to be married to Barkha in the public eye, and Radhika will perform all of the normal tasks at home.
Radhika obediently performs all the duties of a "choti bahu". Barkha puts sleeping powder in Dev's juice, causing him to become unconscious. Barkha then reveals that she loves Dev and Radhika overhears everything. Barkha realizes this and decides to kill Radhika to get Dev's love. Barkha murders Radhika by driving into her with a car twice. In a twist, Radhika returns after a month, but this time is different — she has become confident and fearless. This is because Kanha, the god Radhika is devoted to, has disguised himself as Radhika to put an end to Barkha's crimes, as Dev is made only for Radhika.
The rest of the story tells how Kanha teaches Barkha her lesson. One day, when Kanha is at home as Radhika, Dev asks her if she's alright. Radhikha asks why, and Dev tells her he saw her outside the temple begging for help. This is actually the real Radhika, who was reborn after Barkha tried to suffocate her. Dev is later poisoned by a juice that Barkha got originally for Radhika, and the family believes Radhika did it. Barkha repeatedly tries to get Radhika out of the house.
Then the real Radhika comes in the house. However, Kahna helps Radhika throughout everything. Barkha tries to murder Radhika again, but Dev stops her. The entire family then appears and disgraces Barkha, finally knowing her true nature. However, as Radhika faints, Barkha flees and successfully escapes. Later in the day, while Radhika and Dev go into the forest, Barkha tries to kill both of them, thinking that if she can't have Dev, no one can. However, everyone thinks she dies instead. The monastery was being taken by the bharawaj family which was however Radhikas real family. Ruby wants to kill Radhika even though she is her twin sister and that is the reason why she wants to kill her. Radhika and Dev both go to mumbai to radhika's house but Dev feels uncomfortable when they get a unwelcoming welcome from Ruby. Ruby and Jolly (Rubys brother who loves her so much) try to make a plan to throw Dev and radhika out of the house. When everyone comes to the party and Radhika finds out that everyone was using her to get the
monastery land and humiliate her husband she severs all ties with them and try to find krishnas idol and leave but Khana comes and tell Radhika she has to stay back alone because of the battle against right and wrong. Radika stays back but Dev and her in laws get mad at her and Radhika s family think that she did that for money and she became greedy. In the morning Radikha was doing a puja without an idol and ruby comes but she is not her self but an evil spirit comes and possessed her body and "Ruby" strangles Radhika but doesn't succeed.

Dev is confused and the family.the next morning Ruby s family come to pick her up but the spirit comes in her and she says that she wants to stay and says that the monastery will stay with her. Then after a few incidents Radhika and Dev find out that Ruby is possessed by an evil spirit and the priest says that either Ruby or Radhika have to live but to take away the evil spirit radhika must go to a cave that leads to the world of death. she has to get an antidote that will take the evil spirit out of ruby's body. Radhika faces snakes and poisonous plants. She survives by praying to Kanha . At home sonia (Radhika's step-mother aunt), Rb (Radhika and Ruby s father), and Jolly think Dev is talking rubbish when he tells them that ruby is possessed by an evil spirit and she cant get out of the house. Sonia thinks that this is an opportunity to get the bharadwaj property and ruby would die. Jolly tells Ruby who is suffering that Dev is talking rubbish and takes off Kanha's locket to protect ruby then the spirit comes in ruby and kicks Jolly out. Jolly is shocked and so is the family. Radhika gets the antidote and tries to give it to ruby but the spirit flies and Tries to kill ruby radhika saves her and ruby says sorry to everyone for being to rude. Then she dies. Everyone agrees that she is dead but radhika does not. She goes to the temple and tells Kanha to bring her to life but she kills herself instead and dies and talks to Kanha. Kanha says that this is her destiny but radhika changed it and she isn't supposed to die. Radhika tells kanha to bring her to life and kanha listens and ruby comes to life. Ruby is sad and begs to khana to bring her to life and promises him she will never be bad to radhika. She tells radhika she will change and Jolly also says to khana and puts his gun before kanha and promises he will never do anything illegal but just let his sister come to life. Radhika comes to life and ruby and Jolly thank khana. Sonia and the others cant believe it. Sonia is mad then she wont get the property. Rb says that his first wife who is radhika's mother savatri died when radhika and ruby were babies and took radhika to mansaraam. Rb admits that Kanha exists and everyone bow down and thank kanha.

The China Syndrome

The China Syndrome is a disaster movie about a near-meltdown at a nuclear power plant. It was released on March 16, 1979, twelve days before the Three Mile Island accident. The term "China syndrome" refers to a scenario, not meant to be taken literally, where a reactor core could melt through the Earth "all the way to China".

News reporter Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her cameraman Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) are filming a special on nuclear power at the (fictional) Ventana Nuclear Power Plant when they witness an earthquake followed by a reactor scram. In the control room, Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) notices that the water level is high and asks another member of the crew to open a relief valve. Ted Spindler (Wilford Brimley) warns him that regulations do not permit opening the relief valve, but he proceeds to open it anyway. The control room crew then notices that the water level is actually dangerously low, and declare an emergency over the intercom ordering all personnel to safety areas. They manage to bring the water level back up to a safe level, meanwhile, Richard secretly films the incident. Richard wants to show the film on television, but the station manager will not allow it. Richard then steals the film and shows it to a group of nuclear engineers who determine that the plant came very close to the China syndrome, where the core would have melted through its containment and down into the Earth, contaminating a large area. Meanwhile, Jack Godell discovers that the welds on the main pump are not safe, and takes over the plant by force, locks himself in the control room, and demands to be interviewed on television. A SWAT team is called in, and proceeds to break into the control room. The other members of the control room crew cut wires in other areas of the plant to intentionally cause a scram. When the scram begins, the main pump fails, and Jack Godell is shot by the SWAT team.

Upon its release, the movie was criticized by the nuclear power industry, referring to the movie as "sheer fiction" and a "character assassination of an entire industry". Twelve days after the movie was released, however, the Three Mile Island accident occurred in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. Both the accident depicted in the movie and the real-world accident at Three Mile Island involved loss of water through a relief valve, as well as the control room crew incorrectly reading water levels.

Maurice Yaméogo

Maurice Yaméogo (31 December 1921 – 15 September 1993) was the first President of the Republic of Upper Volta, now called Burkina Faso, from 1959 until 1966.

"Monsieur Maurice" incarnated the Voltaic state at the time of independence. As a member of the colonial administration, Maurice Yaméogo began his career in 1946 in the dense political landscape of Upper Volta thanks to his oratory skills. In May 1957, as part of the formation of the first Volta Government established by the framework law Defferre, he joined the coalition government formed by Ouezzin Coulibaly, as Minister of Agriculture under the label of the Movement Voltaic Democratic (MDV) . In January 1958, threatened by a motion of censure, Ouezzin Coulibaly debauched in favor of the Voltaic Democratic Union-African Democratic Rally (UDV-RDA) Maurice Yaméogo and his allies at the assembly against the insurance of a promotion in the government. Maurice Yaméogo thus raises No. 2 of the government with the portfolio of the Interior, a key position that allows him when in September 1958 Ouezzin Coulibaly dies, to act as interim head of government.

Maurice Yaméogo quickly imposes his choices. After the proclamation of the Republic on December 11, 1958, it operates in 1959 a surprising reversal of position vis-à-vis the proposed Federation of Mali defended by Léopold Sédar Senghor. Although the Voltaic constituent assembly wanted Haute-Volta to join the Federation, Maurice Yaméogo opted for international sovereignty and regional integration limited to the economic sphere with the Entente Council. Then Yaméogo neutralizes any parliamentary opposition. The UDV-RDA purified of its adversaries, imposes in single party. Upper Volta is even before independence, on August 5, 1960, under the yoke of his dictatorship.

In foreign politics, jealous and admiring of the international success of his Ivorian colleague Félix Houphouët-Boigny, he challenged him by establishing an ephemeral customs union (1961-1962) with the very progressive Ghana of Kwame Nkrumah. Houphouët-Boigny quickly became his best ally in December 1965. Yaméogo signed with him an agreement to establish dual citizenship for Ivorian and Voltaic nationals. This project does not have time to succeed. On January 3, 1966, in a context of severe financial austerity measures, his corrupt regime was overthrown by a peaceful demonstration organized by the forces of the Voltaic nation: the unions, the so-called traditional chieftaincy and the clergy. The result is Maurice Yaméogo, an austerity linked to his dubious management of finances. In 1993, he died after being rehabilitated by the President of the Republic Blaise Compaore.

It is simpler than a torque converter, but it does not provide any torque multiplication, so it must be used together with a gearbox.

Batting (cricket)

In the sport of cricket, batting is the act or skill of hitting the cricket ball with a cricket bat. It is done to score runs or prevent the loss of one's wicket. 
Any player who is currently batting is called a batter even if they are better in any other skills in cricket. Batters have to adapt to various conditions when playing on different cricket pitches, especially in different countries. A top-level batter has good reflexes, decision-making and strategy with excellent physical batting skills.

During an innings two members of the batting side are on the pitch. The one facing the current delivery from the bowler is called 'the striker', while the other is the non-striker. When a batter is out, he is replaced by a teammate. This continues until the end of the innings or until 10 of the team members are out. After the batting of first team is over the other team gets a turn to bat.

Batting tactics and strategy depends on the type of match being played. It also depends on the current state of play. Batters try to score many runs quickly without losing their wicket. To score quickly, risky shots must be played which increases the chances of batters being out. Batters’ safest choice is to guard the stumps but this may result in scoring fewer runs.

As with all other cricket statistics, batting statistics and records are given much attention. It helps to know how effectively a batter is playing. The main statistic for batting is a player's batting average. This is calculated by dividing the number of runs he has scored by the number of times he has been out (dismissed).

Kurukshetra

Kurukshetra () is a city in the state of Haryana, India. It is also known as Dharmakshetra ("Holy Place"). It is also known as the "Land of Bhagwad Gita".

According to the Puranas, Kurukshetra is a region named after King Kuru, the ancestor of Kauravas and Pandavas. This is place where Mahabharata war was fought. Also the Bhagavad Gita was explained there during the war when Lord Krishna found Arjuna in a difficult situation.

Before 1947, Thanesar was the name of the tehsil headquarters and the town. Thanesar or Sthaneswar is a historical town next to newly created Kurukshetra city. Thanesar derives its name from the word "Sthaneshwar", which means "Place of God".

In most ancient Hindu texts, Kurukshetra is not a city but a region ("kshetra" meaning "region" in Sanskrit). The boundaries of Kurukshetra lies to the central and western parts of state of Haryana and southern Punjab. Thus according to the Taittiriya Aranyaka 5.1.1., the Kurukshetra region is south of Turghna (Srughna/Sugh in Sirhind, Punjab), north of Khandava (Delhi and Mewat region), east of Maru (desert) and west of Parin.

It is written in Puranas that Kurukshetra is named after King Kuru of the Bharata Dynasty, ancestor of Pandavas and Kauravas.

The Vamana Purana tells how King Kuru came to settle here. He chose this land at the banks of Sarasvati River which dried up before 1900 BCE for embedding spirituality with eight virtues: austerity (Tapas (Sanskrit)), truth (Satya), forgiveness (Kshama), kindness (daya), purity (Shuddha), charity (Daana), Yajna and Brahmacharya. Lord Vishnu was impressed with the act of King Kuru and blessed him. God gave him two boons: one that this land forever will be known as a Holy Land and the other that anyone dying on this land will go to heaven. The land of Kurukshetra was between two rivers — the Sarasvati and the Drishadvati.
This land has been known as Uttarvedi, Brahmavedi, Dharamkshetra and Kurukshetra at different periods. When King Kuru came on this land it was called Uttarvedi. Over the period this land has been ruled by many empires. The Bharata Dynasty came and settled here.

By the archaeological grounds it has been proved that Ashoka the Great made Kurukshetra a centre of learning for people from all over the world. It reached the peak of its progress during the reign of King Harsha, during which Chinese scholar Xuanzang visited Thanesar.




Kurukshetra has great importance as a Hindu pilgrimage. There are several pilgrimages around the city of kurukshetra and a complete parikrama means to visit all these pilgrimages. 48 kos parikrama is a Hindi phrase meaning 48 miles circle around the holy city of Kurukshetra.


Sykes–Picot Agreement

The Sykes–Picot Agreement /ˈsaɪks piˈkoʊ/, officially known as the Asia Minor Agreement, was a secret agreement concluded between the United Kingdom and France in 1916. The main aim of the British and French was to agree on who should get which sphere of influence in Ottoman territories in Southwest Asia. In this way, they wanted to limit competition between each other after the First World War and secure strategically important territories for themselves. The line separating their respective zones of influence was called the Sykes-Picot line. The Russian Empire and the Kingdom of Italy consented to the agreement, receiving a territorial advantage in return. The agreement was named after the two diplomats who negotiated it: the British diplomat Mark Sykes and the French diplomat François Georges-Picot. They negotiated for five weeks, from the 23rd of November 1915 to the 3rd of January 1916, before agreeing on a memorandum. The agreement itself was concluded on the 9th and 16th of May 1916, when the British and French governments accepted and signed (ratified) the memorandum.

When the Russian revolutionaries made the agreement public in 1917 after the Bolshevik Revolution, which caused embarassment among the British and French and growing distrust among the Arabs. More than hundred years later, this agreement is still mentioned in the current conflicts and disputes in the respective regions of the Middle East.
The Ottoman Empire, under the lead of the CUP, entered the war in autumn 1914 on the side of the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and initially also Italy) and was therefore opposed to the Triple Entente (United Kingdom, France and the Russian Empire). The Sykes–Picot Agreement was concluded with the British and French expecting victory against the Central Powers and thus the demise of the Ottoman Empire.

As scholars have argued, the Sykes-Picot agreement was signed with the aim to further the colonial and strategic interests of the British and French in the region and settle their rivalry, rather than to create viable states after the war.

The main interest of the British was to secure their access to the Mediterranean Sea and thus the route to India, as well as access to the Iraqi oil fields. At the beginning of the twentieth century, oil replaced coal as the most important resource, being the lighter raw material. This lead to an increasing dependence on oil that was inaccessible on British soil.

The French were interested in securing access to the Mediterranean through the port of Tyre in Lebanon as well as getting their longstanding claims to Mount Lebanon and Damascus validated.

For the Sykes-Picot agreement to pass, Britain and France needed to satisfy the Russians. In exchange for the Russian Empire’s approval of the treaty, the Russian Foreign minister Serkey Saznov and the French ambassador Maurice Paléologue concluded the Saznov-Paléologue Agreement in May 1916. They mutually agreed that the Russian Empire would get Western Armenia in addition to the already earlier attributed Constantinople and the Turkish Straits. The Kingdom of Italy also knew about the agreement and was convinced by being promised Southern Anatolia in the St-Jean-de-Maurienne agreement in 1917.

The Saznov-Paléologue agreement, the St-Jean-de-Maurienne agreement, the Balfour Declaration (between the British and the Zionists) and the Sykes-Picot agreement (with a handful of others concerning the expected partition of the Ottoman Empire) are often referred to as "The Secret Treaties".

Prior to starting negotiations with the French, the British had already discussed the future of Greater Syria with Sharif Hussein, the Emir of Mecca, in 1915. In what is known as the Hussein-McMahon correspondence, the British promised the Arabs an independent state in the area of Greater Syria. In return, Sharif Hussein would incite an Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. 
Geographically, the agreement primarily focused on the provinces outside of the Arabian Peninsula. A line separated a zone A (under indirect French rule) from a zone B (under indirect British rule). Zone A included the major inland cities of Syria as well as the Iraqi city of Mosul, zone B stretched from Iraq to the Sinai borders of Egypt. A blue zone along the Eastern Mediterranean coastline (and parts of what is today Turkey) was supposed to be placed under direct French rule. The United Kingdom was supposed to have direct control over the Iraqi provinces of Basra and Baghdad (the red zone), as well as parts of what is Israel today, ensuring British access to the Mediterranean Sea. Palestine was supposed to be placed under international administration.

The Arab state that McMahon had promised to Sharif Hussein was now supposed to be under indirect British and French control. This has led historians to call the Sykes-Picot agreement "a startling piece of double-dealing" by the British and an "outrageous example of imperial perfidy".

Following the October Revolution of 1917, the Russian revolutionaries (Bolsheviks) released a series of secret documents. Among these publications was the Sykes–Picot Agreement. The publication of the Sykes-Picot agreement made visible the conflicting promises the British had made concerning the Ottoman territory to the French, Sharif Hussein and the Arabs and the Zionists (in the Balfour Declaration).

The agreement is often accused of having "drawn lines in the sand", i.e. artificially dividing the Middle East without regard to ethnic or cultural factors. In fact the agreement was never (fully) implemented. It was in the San Remo Conference (1920) and Treaty of Lausanne (1923) that the lines were definitely drawn and decided who was going to govern (directly and indirectly) which parts of the partitioned Ottoman Empire, with Turkey wanting to rule areas that the French had initially hoped to govern. Although the agreement was indeed not implemented in its original form, the British and French were able to secure strategically important lands. The Arabs on the other hand did not see the establishment of an independent Arab kingdom as promised and felt betrayed.

The year 2016 marked the 100th anniversary of the Sykes–Picot Agreement, which was heavily debated given its frequent mention by ISIS (ISIS released a video entitled "The End of Sykes-Picot" in 2014). ISIS claimed that in order to create a unified Islamic State, it intended to reverse the effects of the Sykes–Picot Agreement.

Slighting

Slighting is the deliberate damage of an important building. In the Middle Ages, castles were slighted during war. Rich and powerful people built and owned castles, and were proud of them. A king or queen could use slighting as a way to punish people who rebelled against them. Sometimes the owner feared they would lose the castle in an attack, and broke parts of the castle so that it would not be useful to other people. Occasionally, a king or queen might order someone to dismantle their own castle if they did not get permission to build it.

Castles were sometimes repaired after they were slighted, while others were abandoned. Many famous castles like Corfe or Kenilworth are ruins because they were slighted during the English Civil War.

Murder of Brian Wells

Brian Douglas Wells (November 15, 1956 – August 28, 2003) was an American man who died after a homemade neck-bomb exploded while being involved in a plot involving a bank robbery in Erie, Pennsylvania.

Investigated by a task force led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, it was described as "one of the most complicated and bizarre crimes in the annals of the FBI". The Wells story was the subject of significant attention in the mass media. The question of whether Wells was a victim or a mastermind behind the robbery plot is debated.

In a July 2007 indictment, federal prosecutors said that Wells had been involved in the planning of the botched bank robbery. Two of his alleged co-conspirators, Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong and Kenneth Barnes, were indicted. In 2008, U.S. District Judge Sean J. McLaughlin sentenced Barnes to 45 years in federal prison.

Death of Gloria Ramirez

Gloria Ramirez (January 11, 1963 – February 19, 1994) was an American woman dubbed "the Toxic Lady" by the media when several hospital workers became ill after exposure to her body and blood. She was from Riverside, California.

Ramirez had been admitted to the ER while suffering from late-stage cervical cancer. While treating Ramirez, several hospital workers fainted and others experienced symptoms such as shortness of breath and muscle spasms.

Five workers required hospitalization, one of whom remained in intensive care unit for two weeks. 

Shortly after arriving at the hospital, Ramirez died from complications related to cancer. This incident was initially thought to be a case of mass hysteria. 

The medical staff injected her with diazepam, midazolam, and lorazepam to sedate her. When it became clear that Ramirez was responding poorly to treatment, the staff tried to defibrillate her heart. Many people saw an oily substance covering Ramirez's body. Others noted a fruity, garlic-like odor that they thought was coming from her mouth.

An investigation by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said that Ramirez had been self-injecting dimethyl sulfoxide as a treatment for pain, which converted into dimethyl sulfate, an extremely poisonous agent via a series of chemical reactions in the emergency department. Although the medical sector of Riverside supports this claim, scientists still believe it is not the case.

After several investigations, the most likely cause is that she covered herself in DMSO, or dimethyl sulfoxide, to relieve the pain caused by her cancer.

Two months after Ramirez died, her badly decomposed body was released for an independent autopsy and burial. On April 20, 1994—ten weeks after her death—Ramirez was buried at Olivewood Memorial Park in Riverside.

Construction of a light railway has begun between Odawara and Atami, two towns in east Japan. At the construction site, workers are using minecarts for transporting earth and sand. Ryōhei, aged eight, is interested in these minecarts. One day, he pushes one of the minecarts with a construction worker. At the beginning, he is very excited. But as it gets late in the day, he starts to worry about how he will get home. After a while, the construction worker tells him to go home because it is late. Ryōhei runs down a dark hill road thinking “I just don’t want to die”. As soon as he comes back home, he bursts into tears.

He becomes an adult and moves to Tokyo. He looks back on that time. He is tired of everyday life. Without any reason, he sometimes dreams of the dark hill road.

The story is set between Odawara and Atami. The boy describes seeing the sea on his right as he heads away from his home, and on his left on the way back. Because of this, it seems that he was moving toward Odawara from Atami.

Rikiishi Heizo was a journalist from Yugawara, a town between Atami and Odawara. The Atami light railway was under construction when he was a boy. Construction workers changed a human-powered railway into a light railway. Rikiishi looked back on his memory of watching this construction work and wrote it down.

Most of the opinion polls suggested an overall Pakistan Muslim League (N) lead with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) being the close second. Many people are believing that the Pakistani courts and military are rigging the votes in favor of the PTI and against the PML (N).

Pakistan Tahreek e Insaaf party leader Imran Khan leads in early poll results despite calls of corruption. The allegations were denied by the Election Commission of Pakistan.

On July 27, election officials declared that Khan's party had won 109 of the 269 seats, giving PTI a majority in the National Assembly thus making Khan Prime Minister-elect. On August 15, Asad Qaiser elected as Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan and Qasim Suri as Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan. On August 17, Imran Khan elected as Prime Minister of Pakistan

Coral bleaching

Coral bleaching occurs when stony corals turn white.

Stony corals are simple animals that form large reefs. The animals live in a endosymbiotic relationship with single-celled algae. To get sunlight the corals live just below sea level. The algae make food products for the coral polyp by photosynthesis.

Coral polyps are sensitive to changes in their environment. This includes the temperature of the water they live in. Under stress, coral polyps may expel the algae which live inside their tissues. The algae provide up to 90% of the coral's energy. Bleached corals continue to live but begin to starve after bleaching. Some corals recover.

Warmer sea water temperatures caused by global warming is the leading cause of coral bleaching.

The United Nations Environment Programme says that the longest recorded global bleaching events happened between 2014 and 2016. Coral was killed on an unprecedented scale. In 2016, bleaching of coral on the Great Barrier Reef killed between 29 and 50 percent of the reef's coral. 
In 2017, the bleaching got into the central region of the reef. The interval between bleaching events has halved between 1980 and 2016.

Recent research showed that the coral-algae relationship is much older than was thought. This suggests it has survived many climate changes.

Some corals change color instead of turning white when they are bleached. The colors can be very bright. In May 2020, scientists from the University of Southampton said that the colors act like sunscreen and protect the coral cells from light. The scientists said this means some corals can lose their algae for a while and might have developed bright colors as a way to make it easier for the algae to come back and to stay alive until then.

His first term, the country went through a severe economic crisis, social unrest and violence. He ran unsuccessfully for the Presidency in 2001, losing in a run-off to Alejandro Toledo. He ran again in 2006 and was elected to a second term, even though his first term in the 1980s was thought to be the worst in the country's history.

During García's second term, Peru had increased environmental damage, according to critics, and increased social conflict, according to the national human rights ombudsman's office.

García ran for a third term as president in the 2016 Peruvian general election as the candidate of the criticized Popular Alliance coalition which included APRA’s old rival, the Christian People’s Party with Lourdes Flores as his first running mate. The election's first round polls gave García 5.83% of the popular vote, preventing him from participating in the runoff election. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski was ultimately elected.

Ollanta Moisés Humala Tasso (; born 27 June 1962) is a Peruvian politician. He was the 65th President of Peru from 2011 to 2016. Humala lost the 2006 presidential election and eventually won the 2011 presidential election in a run-off vote. He was elected as President of Peru in the second round, defeating Keiko Fujimori (daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori).
Born to a prominent political family affiliated with the ethnocacerist movement, Humala is the son of famed Quechua labour lawyer Isaac Humala. Humala entered the Peruvian Army in 1981, eventually achieveing the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. During his time in the military, he fought in the internal conflict against far-left terrorist group Shining Path as well as in the Cenepa War with neighboring Ecuador. In October 2000, Humala attempted an unsuccessful coup d'etatagainst President Alberto Fujimori during the dying days of his regime; eventually, Congress granted him amnesty and Humala was allowed to return to military duty.
In 2005, Humala entered electoral politics, founding the Peruvian Nationalist Party (PNP) in order to run in the 2006 presidential election. Having received first place in the first round, he faced former centre-left President and APRA candidate Alan García in the second round, ultimately losing by a narrow margin. His campaign received widespread international attention in 2006 given the recent success of left-wing politicians in Latin America. In 2011, he would once again run for President, and narrowly defeated Keiko Fujimori in the runoff.

Humala's election initially concerned investors, who feared he would govern similar to far-left Venezuelan PresidentHugo Chavez, a former ally of his. To assuage these fears, Humala would begin his term by choosing centrists for positions in his cabinet. Humala's unpopular presidency was dominated by corruption scandals surrounding him and his politically influential wife Nadine Heredia. Environmentalists were highly critical of Humala's mining policies, and argued that he reneged on his campaign promise to reign in mining companies.

Humala was arrested by Peruvian authorities in July 2017 for illegally accepting bribes and awaits a corruption trial.

Humala ran for president again in 2021, but lost in the first round of the election.

Make believe creatures like dragons, dwarves and elves live on the Discworld.

The Discworld books follow lots of different characters and storylines. Sometimes, the same main characters are used in several books to create a story arc:

Rincewind was the first main character in Discworld books. He is a wizard who does not know any spells and tries to run away from everything. Even though he is a coward, he saves the world several times by accident.

Death is seen in all the Discworld books except for The Wee Free Men and Snuff. He is a seven foot tall skeleton who appears when people die to take their souls to the afterlife. Even though he is seen as frightening, he is sometimes kind to people. He especially likes cats.

Sorites paradox

Sorites paradox (also called Paradox of the heap) is a paradox that arises when unclear terms are used. The name of the paradox is related to the Greek word for "heap" ('soros'). There are different versions, but a typical one involves a heap of sand. The heap is made of many grains of sand. So if one grain is removed, the structure will still be a heap. This process can be repeated, until only one grain of sand is left. Since the heap never changed to a non-heap, this grain of sand is still a heap.

The paradox works the other way as well. If one begins with one grain of sand and adds another, and then another; when do the grains of sand become a heap?

The Light Fantastic

The Light Fantastic is a fantasy book by Terry Pratchett. It was published in 1986 and it is the second book in the "Discworld" series.

KFUO

KFUO (850 AM) is a Christian radio station in St. Louis County, Missouri. It can be heard locally on the radio, and it also streams online. It is the longest-running Christian radio station in the United States. The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) owns and runs the station. It broadcasts talk programs about the Bible, theology, and society. It also plays Lutheran sacred music. The station broadcasts four Lutheran church services on the weekends.

KFUO's studios are in the LCMS headquarters in Kirkwood, Missouri. The transmitter is located at Concordia Seminary in Clayton.

KFUO broadcasts on the same frequency as KOA (AM) in Denver, Colorado. KOA is a clear-channel station. Because of this, KFUO must stop at night. The station's website plays sacred music when the 850 AM signal is off the air.

On February 19, 1923, Richard Kretzschmar said that there should be a Lutheran radio station. This happened at a meeting of the Board of Control of Concordia Seminary. Then they raised money from students and other Lutheran organizations. Then they started a "radio committee" to oversee the project.

Soon afterwards, construction for the station began at the seminary. At this time, it was located in St. Louis. The control room and studio for the station were located in the attic of one of the seminary buildings. The license to broadcast was issued on October 25, 1924. The station went on air for the first time the next day. It broadcast a speech about the laying of the cornerstone for the new seminary being constructed in Clayton. The station was formally dedicated and began regular broadcasting on December 14, 1924. In 1927, the station moved to the new campus of Concordia Seminary in Clayton.

At first, KFUO had to share frequences with other stations. The FCC approved the station to move to 830 kHz on July 1, 1940. By September 1941, the FCC reassigned the station to 850 kHz, where it has remained to this day. It also received a "limited time" license because this was the same frequency as KOA in Denver. KFUO can only operate between 80.5 and 102.5 hours per week. The exact hours depend on the times of sunrise and sunset in Denver.

The LCMS started the FM station KFUO-FM at 99.1 MHz in 1948. At first, the FM station broadcast the same thing as the AM station. In 1975, KFUO-FM switched to broadcasting classical music. In March 2010 the FM station was sold to Gateway Creative Broadcasting. On July 7, 2010 of that year it switched to a Contemporary Christian format.

In 1997, the FCC said that the LCMS's radio stations had violated the FCC's Equal Employment Opportunity requirements. The FCC said that KFUO and KFUO-FM did not hire enough minorities, women, and non-Lutherans. The LCMS lost an appeal within the FCC, and then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That court found, in Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod v. FCC (1998), that the FCC's requirements were unconstitutional.

KFUO began streaming its broadcast on the station's web site, kfuo.org, in 1998. In 2004, KFUO started its HD radio station, the first in Missouri.

In 2008, there was a controversy about the theological talk show, "Issues, Etc.". The program was removed from the station on March 18. The producer and host were also fired. Three weeks later, the management of KFUO announced that "Issues, Etc." was canceled because the station did not have enough money for it. The station did not make its financial information public. About 75 people had a peaceful protest outside the LCMS International Center to question the station's motives. More than 7,000 people signed a petition online to ask for the program to be returned. The program started again on another local Christian radio station on June 30, 2008. On March 13, 2012, the program returned to KFUO. The company that now produces it, Lutheran Public Radio, now pays KFUO for airtime.

The studios of KFUO were moved to the LCMS International Center, the LCMS's headquarters in Kirkwood, Missouri, on June 24, 2013. The transmitter is still located at Concordia Seminary.

War of the Third Coalition

The War of the Third Coalition was a European War during the years 1803 to 1806. During the war, France and the countries it conquered, led by Napoleon I, defeated an alliance, called The Third Coalition. The Third Coalition was made up of the Holy Roman Empire, Russia, Britain and others. The main fighting in Central Europe ended with Napoleon's victory at the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805 but a smaller campaign continued in Italy until Napoleon won there, too.

War of the Fourth Coalition

The Fourth Coalition fought in a war against Napoleon's French Empire from 1806–1807. The coalition was defeated.

Countries in the Coalition included Prussia, Russia, Saxony, Sweden, and Great Britain. Several members of the coalition had previously been fighting France in the Third Coalition, and there wasn't any peace in between wars. On October 9, 1806, Prussia joined a new coalition, fearing that France was becoming more powerful after it defeated Austria and established the Confederation of the Rhine. Prussia and Russia prepared for a new campaign. Prussian troops moved to Saxony.

On 14 October 1806, the French defeated the Prussian army at the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt. Then French forces occupied Prussia and captured Berlin. Later they advanced towards Poland and Russia. On 7-8 February 1807, the French and Russian armies fought the Battle of Eylau. There was no clear winner. On 14 June 1807, the French defeated the Russians at the Battle of Friedland. In July 1807, France made peace with Russia, ending the war. This left Napoleon as ruler of most of western and central Europe. The exceptions were Spain, Portugal, Austria, and a few smaller states. These were able to remain independent. 

Even though the Fourth Coalition came to an end, Britain remained at war with France. Later that year, the Peninsular War started.

Dareen Tatour

Dareen Tatour (Arabic: دارين طاطور, born April 16, 1982 in Reineh) is a Palestinian poet and photographer. She wrote an Arabic book called "The Final Invasion", which she published in 2010. In 2017, an English anthology of Palestinian poets called "A Blade of Grass: New Palestinian Poetry" included translations of her writing. She is a citizen of Israel.

She was arrested in 2015 by Israeli police. They accused her of terrorism and inciting violence. Then her trial became famous and many free speech activists defended her. In May 2018 she was found guilty, and in July 2018 she was sent to prison for six months. She served 42 days in prison and was set free on September 20, 2018.

At Tatour's trial, a police officer translated her poem, "Resist them, my people, resist them." This police officer was not a professional translator and did not have experience with literature. Tatour's defense team invited a professional translator. Tatour's accusers said the professional translator was biased.

Tatour's accusers also showed one of her Facebook posts. It said "I am the next martyr." They claimed that this meant she was planning terrorism. They also showed that she had shared the Facebook status of a terrorist group.

Tatour's defense team invited literature professors to her trial. They said that the Russian Empire and British Mandate of Palestine did not put Jewish writers on trial for "much harsher words."

Many writers protested her arrest. In June 2016, there was a protest in Tel Aviv. Almost 20 poets, writers and translators read their writing. Sami Michael wrote that her arrest showed that Israel was helpless and its culture had failed. He said that Israel could not defend itself but could only make writers be quiet. The poet Lilach Weber also wrote a poem about her.

In October 2016 more than 180 poets, writers and intellectuals asked for her freedom. Four of them were winners of the Israel Prize: A. B. Yehoshua, Tuvia Rivner, Avishai Margalit and Shimon Sandbank. The statement said Tatour was "arrested and tried for writing a poem." They believed this went against "democracy, free speech and creativity." They added that it made it difficult for Arabs and Jews to talk to each other and end the Arab-Israeli conflict. A poet and activist named Tal Nitzan led these efforts.

After she was found guilty, PEN International wrote that she was only doing her job as a writer: "we use our words to peacefully challenge injustice."

Tatour was set free on September 20, 2018.

WannaCry ransomware attack

WannaCry ransomware attack was a worm that infected many Windows computers around the world on May 2017. The worm had spread malware that encrypted the user's computer data (i.e. scrambled the user's computer data into meaningless information) and demanded affected users to pay $300 Bitcoin within 3 days or $600 Bitcoin within 7 days before all of the affected computer's data is destroyed. The malware had cost the world millions to billions of dollars to fix their servers and computers.

The WannaCry ransomware attack started in May 14th 2017.

Mr. Park, who also went by the alias Pak Jin Hek, is unlikely to see the inside of an American courtroom. The United States has no direct, formal relations with North Korea and did not communicate with its reclusive government ahead of the charges.

Concordia Theological Seminary

The Concordia Theological Seminary is an institution of theological higher education. It is run by the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) and is located in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Its main purpose is to teach men who will become pastors in the congregations of the LCMS. It also teaches women who will become deaconesses. It offers professional, master's and doctoral degrees.

In 1844, a pastor in Fort Wayne named Frederick C. D. Wynecken started teaching two men to be pastors. The next year, he became a pastor in Baltimore, and a pastor named Wilhelm Sihler continued teaching in Fort Wayne. The seminary officially started in August 1846, when eleven students and an instructor from Germany arrived in Fort Wayne. They were sent by a German pastor named Wilhelm Loehe. At first, classes were held in a nearby house.

The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod was started in 1847. Loehe then gave ownership of the seminary to the synod. Two years later, the seminary purchased land east of Fort Wayne and built the first building on its new campus.

Other people in the LCMS called Concordia Theological Seminary the "practical seminary", because it tried to teach men to become pastors quickly. It taught pre-seminary and seminary classes. The pre-seminary classes were similar to high school classes. The seminary classes taught theology. At this time, it did not teach Greek and Hebrew, the languages that the Bible was originally written in.

In 1861, the seminary moved to the campus of Concordia Seminary, in St. Louis, Missouri. This is the synod's other seminary. This was done so that students wouldn't be drafted for the American Civil War.

In 1874, the pre-seminary students and one instructor were moved to the campus of the former Illinois State University in Springfield, Illinois. The next year, 1875, the "practical seminary" itself moved to the Springfield campus.

In 1918, an additional year of instruction was added to the pre-seminary courses. These additional courses made pastors eligible to get teaching certificates. After 1935, Greek was made a required course.

Starting in 1941, all entering students had to be high school graduates. The seminary then stopped teaching high school classes. Later, they required two years of college for entering students.
In 1976, the seminary returned to Fort Wayne.

The seminary has four departments: Exegetical Theology, Historical Theology, Pastoral Ministry and Mission, and Systematic Theology.

Michael Avenatti

Michael John Avenatti (born February 16, 1971) is an American lawyer and businessman. Avenatti is best known for suing President Donald Trump on behalf of porn star Stormy Daniels in an attempt to prove that Trump paid Daniels to stay silent during their affair.

Avenatti said that he would run for president in 2020 if Trump runs for re-election and if no other candidate is good enough to beat Trump.

Avenatti was found guilty of wire fraud and identity theft in February 2022. On June 2, 2022, he was sentenced to four years in prison for defrauding Stormy Daniels. On December 5, 2022, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison for wire fraud and obstruction against the IRS.

Born on February 16, 1971 in Sacramento, California, Avenatti spent his early childhood in Colorado and Utah. He moved with his family to Chesterfield, Missouri, near St. Louis, in 1982, where he attended Parkway Central High School. After graduating in 1989, Avenatti attended Saint Louis University for a year before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated with a B.A. in political science in 1996.

He attended George Washington University Law School, where he graduated Order of the Coif and first in his class with a J.D. in 2000. In 2003, George Washington University Law School established the Michael J. Avenatti Award for Excellence in Pre-Trial and Trial Advocacy, an annual award given to the member of the graduating Juris Doctor class who demonstrates excellence in pre-trial and trial advocacy. Avenatti also received George Washington University's prestigious Alumni Recognition Award in 2010.

While in college and later in law school, Avenatti worked at The Research Group, a political opposition research and media firm run by Rahm Emanuel (later White House Chief of Staff for President Barack Obama, and Mayor of Chicago). Avenatti worked on over 150 Democratic and Republican campaigns in 42 states while studying at George Washington University.

After law school, Avenatti worked at O'Melveny & Myers in Los Angeles, California, alongside Daniel M. Petrocelli, who previously represented the Ron Goldman family in its case against O.J. Simpson. He assisted Petrocelli on multiple legal matters, including the representation of singer Christina Aguilera and litigation surrounding the movie "K-19: The Widowmaker", and worked extensively for Don Henley and Glenn Frey of the musical group the Eagles, including in a suit brought by former bandmate Don Felder against the group and Irving Azoff.

Avenatti later joined Greene Broillet & Wheeler, a Los Angeles boutique law firm. While there, he handled a number of high-profile cases, including a $10 million defamation case against Paris Hilton, settled an idea-theft lawsuit relating to the show "The Apprentice" and against producers Mark Burnett and Donald Trump, and a $40 million embezzlement lawsuit involving KPMG.

In 2007, Avenatti formed the law firm Eagan Avenatti, LLP (formerly known as Eagan O'Malley & Avenatti, LLP) with offices in Newport Beach, Los Angeles and San Francisco, California. He has since appeared on "60 Minutes" three times in connection with cases he has handled. Avenatti has also served as lead counsel on a number of historically large cases, including an April 2017 $454 million verdict after a jury trial in Federal Court in Los Angeles in a fraud case against Kimberly-Clark and Halyard Health, later reduced to a $21.7 million verdict upon appeal, an $80.5 million class-action settlement against Service Corporation International, a $41 million jury verdict against KPMG, and a $39 million malicious prosecution settlement.

In 2013 Avenatti formed a company, Global Baristas, to buy Seattle-based Tully's Coffee out of bankruptcy. Since 2015, Global Baristas has been named in more than 50 lawsuits in state and federal courts for breach of contract, unpaid bills, and unpaid taxes.

In 2015, Avenatti prevailed against the National Football League (NFL) following a jury trial in Dallas. He later pursued a class-action suit on behalf of fans who showed up for Super Bowl XLV with tickets that didn't correspond to actual seats but the courts in Texas declined to certify the class. Later, in 2016, Avenatti filed another class action lawsuit against the NFL, this time on behalf of ticket-holders to the annual Hall of Fame Game, which was cancelled a few hours before kickoff.

In 2017, a Florida man named Gerald Tobin alleged Avenatti failed to pay him $28,700 for private investigatory work. As a result, Avenatti's firm was abruptly forced into bankruptcy. The issue was resolved when the pair entered into a Non-Disclosure Agreement, and Avenatti paid Tobin the $28,700.

In 2018, Avenatti's law firm was subjected to a $10 million judgment in U.S. bankruptcy court. In June 2018, a former partner filed a motion in U.S. bankruptcy court asking for a lien on any and all legal fees Avenatti's firm might collect, up to $10 million, from clients in 54 cases including his representation of Stormy Daniels.

Avenatti has on several occasions, including in a post to Twitter, expressed interest in running for president in 2020. In a CBC TV interview published in September 2018, Avenatti said he would run in 2020 only against Trump or Pence.
