Bichir

Bichirs and the reedfish comprise a freshwater fish family, the Polypteridae, of ancient ray-finned fishes. They are the only family in the order Polypteriformes. All occur in freshwater habitats in tropical Africa and the Nile River system, mainly swampy, shallow floodplains and estuaries.

A closely related group, the Scanilepiformes, are known from the Triassic, and are ancestral to them. The oldest polypterids are around 100 million years old, from the early Late Cretaceous of South America and Africa. They are living fossils.

Polypterids are elongated, dragon-like freshwater fish with a series of dorsal finlets instead of a single dorsal fin. They have have a maximum body length ranging from 25 cm (9.8 in) to over 100 cm (39 in) depending on specific species and morphology.

"Main article: Bawitius"

The scales were different, apart from size, from those of modern bichirs: they feature a discontinuous ganoine layer, a rectilinear shape, and small articular processes.

"Main article: Serenoichthys"

"Serenoichthys" was a small polypterid. In comparison, the giant polypterid "Bawitius" could reach up to 300 cm (9.8 ft).

Polypterids are popular subjects of public and large hobby aquaria, but tend to stay on the ground. Though predatory, they are actually peaceful. They are sometimes called dragon bichir or dragon fin in pet shops for a more appealing name due to their dragon-like appearance. They are also called dinosaur fish due to their resemblance to dinosaurs.

Oostzee

The Oostzee was a small Dutch freight ship on which a serious toxic accident occurred on the Lower Elbe (Germany) in July 1989.

The ship was built in 1980 at the Martin-Jansen shipyard in Leer/Ostfriesland. The hull number was 163 and it was named "Oostzee". It was built for the Rotterdam shipping company Noordlijn. This company was a owned by the Haren-Emser shipping company Intersee Schiffahrtsgesellschaft. From 1981 to 1983 the ship was operated as "Savonia". It was under the management of Intersee and then sold by Noordlijn to the company "Noordzee" in Delfzijl. Noordzee operated it again in the following years under the management of Scheepvaartbedrijf Noordlijn, Emmen under the name "Oostzee".

In July 1989, the "Oostzee" was on a voyage from Rotterdam through the Kiel Canal to Leningrad. The cargo in the ship's hold included barbed wire, silica sand, zinc ingots and 3913 barrels containing about 850 tons of epichlorohydrin. On the voyage from Rotterdam to the Elbe, the freighter encountered bad weather, during which some of the dangerous goods barrels slipped. In the process, about 40 barrels leaked. At the time, Günter Hollmann, a member of the "Oostzee" crisis team, said that improper storage of the toxic barrels was to blame. Contrary to the regulations, the barrels had been placed directly on the floor of the ship and had not been stacked properly. 

On July 18, 1989, the ship arrived at the Kiel Canal, where it was prevented from continuing its voyage due to cargo damage that had already resulted in a chloroform-like odor on board. First the ship was referred to the Neuwerk roadstead and the crew was rescued.

Consideration was given to taking the ship to the manufacturing company Dow Chemical in Bützfleth, to Hamburg or to Cuxhaven, which was rejected in each case due to the proximity to residential areas.Ultimately, the Oostzee was taken to the Elbe port in Brunsbüttel to discharge the damaged cargo. The corresponding work lasted for more than three weeks and resulted in a number of accidents due to a lack of protection against the extremely harmful epichlorohydrin and its compounds.

As a result, numerous aid workers, police officers and sailors became ill and died of cancer.

After the accident, the ship was initially operated by Noordlijn and then sold in 1994 to the Nedlloyd subsidiary K.N.S.M.-Kroonburgh in Rotterdam, where it was operated as Louise Green by the shipping company General Shipping & Chartering Services (GenChart) until 1996. From January 1996, the ship was owned as "Trinity Square" by "Gulfranger Shipping Company" in Limassol and operated by "Vertom Scheepvaart- und Handelsmaatschappij" in Rotterdam. Further stations were from October/November 1998 as "Sandy Cay" for "C. Rehder Schiffsmakler und Reederei" in Limassol, from July 1999 as "Nordica" for "Unisand Shipping Company" in Limassol under management of N.C. Schiffahrtsbüro in Bremerhaven and chartering by "Wilhelm Tietjen Befrachtungsgesellschaft" in Hamburg, from October 2004 "Lady Rea" for "Rea Maritime Corporation" in Panama and finally from August 2006 as "Evgeniy Vasilyev" for "Dream Hills Trading" in Panama under management of "DSL Shipping" in Limassol. At the end of 2009, the freighter was finally taken out of service and sold for demolition. In December 2009, the freighter arrived at the last port for scrapping in China.

The Oostzee poison accident is still one of the best-known shipping accidents on the Elbe and attracted a great deal of media attention at the time due to the numerous mishaps during the handling process. At the time, the accident was the reason for the Federal Ministry of Transport to build and convert existing units into so-called gas protection ships, which can be used in the event of chemical accidents at sea. The accident continues to be a case study that is mentioned again and again on the subject of the risks involved in transporting dangerous goods.

Superstructure and engine plant were located aft. The ship's propulsion system consisted of a six-cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine made by MWM, which delivered its power of up to 3000 hp to the fixed-pitch propeller via a gearbox. Two electro-hydraulic cranes were arranged on the port side.

Von Graben

Herren von Graben, also known as "vom Graben", "Grabner", "ab dem Graben", "von dem Graben", "von Graben von (zum) Stein", "Graben zu Kornberg", "Grabner zu Rosenburg", were an ancient family of the Austrian aristocracy.

Originally from Carniola, it was a cadet branch of the Gorizian dynasty, the Meinhardinians. The Von Graben originated in Carniola. the knight Conrad von Graben is mentioned in 1070 as the first reported member. He owned the old castle of Graben near Rudolfswerth (Novo mesto). The first member to emerge in history was Conrad of Graben († 1307), councilor of Styria. The Orsini-Rosenberg family is a junior branch of the Graben family, which began with Conrad II of Graben († before 1356), son of Conrad I, lord of Graben, Alt-Grabenhofen and Rosenberg. 

Other important lines were the Lords of Graben at Kornberg (1328-1564) in Styria and at Sommeregg (1442-1534) in Carinthia. In 1487 the Grabner family bought the Rosenburg in Lower Austria. This line exists until the middle of the 17th century. There are numerous members of the family who have reached important positions such as politicians, soldiers and diplomats over the centuries. Old sources state that Wolfgang von Graben († 1521) was an ancestor of the De Graeff family. The Dutch family De Graeff has the same coat of arms. However in 1776 Felix Jakob von Graben died and with him the noble family Von Graben.

A detailed list of the lines and branches:

In 2013 the worldwide Family Association Gräff-Graeff (Familienverband Gräff-Graeff e.V.) was founded for the claimed Graeff lineage of Wolfgang von Graben.

The settlement is organized as a communal settlement and is within the jurisdiction of the Shomron Regional Council. In 2021 it had 3,062 residents.

Mount Bracha was established on November 17, 1982. In 1987 a core group of Orthodox families came and founded the settlement. After the establishment of the settlement, Rabbi Eliezer Melamed was appointed rabbi of the settlement, author of the series of halachic books "Pninei Halacha".

The settlement has an elementary school for boys and an elementary school for girls, a high school for boys and a high school for girls, and a "yeshiva". 

In 2011 a large group of Evangelical Christians came to assist in the grape harvest near the settlement, at the initiative and with the approval of Rabbi Melamed, and since then they have resided on the western hill of the settlement.

After several hundred private homes were built in Mount Bracha, the residents decided to start building four, five and six story buildings. This decision was made in order to lower housing prices and give young couples the ability to purchase homes in the village. As part of the construction, a boys school and a girls school were built in Mount Bracha, along with eleven kindergartens.

Raorchestes andersoni

Anderson's bubble-nest frog, Anderson's bush frog, tublercled small tree frog, or tuberculate shrub frog ("Raorchestes andersoni") is a frog. It lives in Bangladesh, Tibet, northeastern India, Bhutan, and China's Yunnan Province. Scientists think it may live in Myanmar too. People have seen it between 0 and 2006 meters above sea level.

This frog lives in trees near the edges or forests and in wetlands. It lays eggs in bodies of water that dry up for part of the year. The tadpoles swim in the water. Scientists do not know if this frog can live in places that human beings have changed.

Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. Scientists believe people cutting down its forests may put this frog in danger. One of the places the frog lives is a protected park.

Raorchestes hassanensis

Dutta's bubble-nest frog or Hassan bush frog ("Raorchestes hassanensis") is a frog. It lives in India.

Scientists used to think this was the same frog as "Raorchestes flaviventris" but they changed their minds in 2015.

This frog lives in evergreen forests and shola forests. People have also seen it on coffee farms and tea farms. It can live in forests that have changed a little, but it cannot live in forests where the tree branches do not come together like a roof at all.

Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out because the place it lives is not very big. However, that place is not becoming worse right now, and the frog can live in places that human beings have changed, for example coffee farms and tea farms. The fungus "Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis" can make other frogs in "Raorchestes" sick, so the fungal disease chytridiomycosis might kill this frog.

Fußballgemeinschaft Salzburg

The Fußballgemeinschaft Salzburg was a wartime syndicate of three football clubs in the city of Salzburg, Austria (then Ostmark) during World War II and existed from April 1943 to April 1945.
After the annexation of Austria to the German Reich in 1938, the clubs in the Salzburg 1st Class and the Western Division League were entitled to take part in the promotion rounds to the then Gauliga. However, the political situation as well as the service obligations, conscription into the German Wehrmacht or the Reichsarbeitsdienst brought football to an almost complete standstill. SV Austria Salzburg, with German guest players who were stationed in Salzburg, became the strongest club in Salzburg's 1st class and won the championship in the 1939/40 and 1940/41 seasons. In 1941, after beating SK Amateure Steyr, the champion of the Oberdonauer 1st class, they made it into the promotion round to the Ostmark division class. In the promotion games, however, Salzburg failed because of the overwhelming opponents SK Sturm Graz, Post SV Wien and BSG Traisen.

After this season, it was difficult to maintain the game in the Salzburg class. With the declaration of "total war" and the consequent conscription of almost all capable players, the club had not enough players. In April 1943, the traditional clubs Salzburger AK 1914, SV Austria Salzburg and 1. Salzburger SK 1919 decided to merge to form the Fußballgemeinschaft Salzburg in order to be able to continue playing.

The management of the association was divided between the officials of the individual clubs. When the new club started, there were only three established players from Austria Salzburg in the squad and young players from the other two clubs were added to the squad. The 1942/43 season had to be canceled because the new syndicate had only one competitor, Reichsbahn SG Salzburg.Austria Salzburg was declared champion.All promotion games against the competitors SK Amateure Steyr and 1. FFC Vorwärts 06 Wien were clearly lost. The Salzburg youth team only scored three goals and was hopelessly inferior to their opponents.

In the 1943/44 season, the FG Salzburg was the only Salzburg representative to play in the Oberdonau-Salzburg league, finishing eighth out of eleven teams. FG Steyr, which also emerged from the war-related merger of the Steyr clubs Amateure and Vorwärts, became champions of this league.

In the aborted and unranked game season 1944/45, the matches were played exclusively by youth players. On April 8, 1945, shortly before the surrender of the German Reich, the FG Salzburg was dissolved. As early as autumn 1945, the three traditional clubs SAK, SSK and Austria set up their own teams again and occupied the first three places in the revived Salzburg 1st class.

She played 104 times for her country, but officially recognized games were a little less because some games were against teams that weren't part of FIFA. She was the head coach of the Dutch national team and led them to win the UEFA Women's Euro in 2017. In 2019, they were runners-up in the FIFA Women's World Cup. In 2020, it was announced that she would become the coach of the England women's national team after Phil Neville's contract ended. She stayed with the Netherlands for the Olympics in 2021 but they didn't win a medal. Then, she started coaching the England team and led them to win the UEFA Women's Euro in 2022.

Gian Carlo Riccardi

Gian Carlo Riccardi (October 21, 1933 - February 7, 2015) was an Italian artist, painter, theatre director, sculptor and writer.

Gian Carlo Riccardi was born on October 21, 1933 in Frosinone, Italy. His father, Armando Riccardi, was a lawyer and his mother, Rosa Amati, was a pianist. In 1961 Gian Carlo Riccardi graduated with honors in scenography at the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome in via Ripetta. Furthermore, during the academic period Riccardi was a pupil of Toti Scialoja and Mario Rivosecchi. After a few years, he obtained a diploma in Theater and Film Direction at the Experimental Center of Rome.

He has been defined by the art critic Enrico Crispolti as a «multimedia artist» and has frequented writers and artists such as Achille Bonito Oliva, Alberto Moravia, Cesare Zavattini, Filiberto Menna, Giuseppe Bonaviri and Vito Riviello. Writers and journalists such as Angelo Maria Ripellino, Elio Pagliarani, Mario Lunetta and André Pieyre de Mandiargues have also written about him.

Between the 60s and 70s he worked as a set designer and director at Rai and as assistant to set designers Carlo Cesarini from Senigallia and Giorgio Aragno. He is also editor of satirical magazines such as "Il Travaso delle Idee", "Marc'Aurelio", "La Tribuna Illustrata", "Simplicissimus" "and Il Borghese". He is part of the Roman Theater Avant-garde collaborating with Pino Pascali, Carmelo Bene, Mario Ricci, Memè Perlini and others.

These experiences lead him to open in Frosinone, in 1961, the "Visual Arts Laboratory Theater Group" and later, in 1962, the "Theater Club" where he sets up, with various actors, artistic performances and shows theatrical.

He takes part in events such as: the "Teatro da Voi 1977" at the Spazio Uno theater in Rome, the "New Theater Week" (1978) and the "1984 Incontri" at the Centro Associazione Stampa Grattacielo in Milan.

The director's shows and performances are based on gestures and the need to express the condition of contemporary man, imprisoned in the daily routine and in the contradictions of life.

In 1997 he founded the "Theater of the Image."

Riccardi's pictorial production deals with various themes such as the grotesque, the double, irony, but also the world of childhood, through drawing, caricature and abstract painting. The latter is achieved through the use of collage and ready-made. His works have been exhibited in solo and group exhibitions in Italy and abroad such as the ArtExpo exhibition in Geneva (1984), the British Art Fair in the City of London (1985 ), the Center International D'art Contemporain in Paris (1988), the Kodama Gallery in Osaka (1993) and the Fundació Antoni Tàpies in Barcelona (1999 ).

In his sculptures Gian Carlo Riccardi uses poor materials such as plexiglas, paper, wood and iron.

The "Rooms", built since the 80s, are installations always made with simple and recycled elements (mainly wood and iron). These are examples of site specific works capable of building a dialogue with the surrounding space and with the observer.

Riccardi exhibited his installations at the European Parliament in 1991, at the XLV Venice Biennale of Art in 1993, and at the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto in 1995.

He writes theatrical scripts, prose and poetic texts. In the latter various themes emerge (already addressed in the pictorial, theatrical and sculptural fields) concerning the surreal, the improbable and the memory.

Gian Carlo Riccardi disappeared on February 7, 2015 in his hometown.

Sunrise of Lords in Lierna Lake Como

The Sunrise of Lords in Lierna Lake Como (also known as Alba dei Signori) is a 20th-century divisionism oil painting by the Baron Vittore Grubicy de Dragon, built on the shore of Borgo Villa in Lierna Lake Como in 1910.

Grubicy's painting is part of the permanent collection of the Giovanni Fattori Civic Museum of Livorno.. Grubicy's paintings are exhibited in the last room that closes the long central hall together with Pollastrini's "Gli esuli di Siena", with a single number and title: «5», «Triptych». The other works in the triptych are: "Alba di Lavoro" and "La Vela". 


The work created on the shore of Lierna on Lake Como, a place that has always been frequented by the high European nobility and by Baron Vittore Grubicy de Dragon. Among the other aspects of Grubicy's art, the practice of «continuously returning to himself, therefore also to canvases that have already been painted for years» is underlined to better render the impression he had in front of nature and «the character in itself of the natural spectacle ». The work is in fact connected to a triptych, whose first work dates back to 1887, when he was 36 years old, while this painting dates back to 1920, when the Baron was 60 years old. The work is a reworking of his whole life, and is the last work done by Baron Grubicy de Dragon before his death.

The horizontal paintings "Alba di lavoro a Lierna" and "Alba di Signori a Lierna" were donated by the artist to the Municipality of Livorno in 1920, shortly before his death, with the explicit intention of placing them side by side with the painting "The sail in Lierna " to make up the triptych. A testament to their importance for the artist and his link with the ancient village of Lierna on Lake Como.

The Sun appears to be the brightest point on the canvas, but measuring its luminance with a photometer shows that Monet gave it the same luminosity as the sky around it. Margaret Livingstone, professor of neurobiology at Harvard University, points out that the desaturation of the colors of the canvas makes the rising sun and its reflection disappear. She also recalls that the fovea of the retina of the human eye distinguishes colors while the peripheral vision captures movements and shadows, which explains that when the gaze is turned away from the sun, the light intensity of the latter fades and peripheral vision gives it an indecisive appearance like at sunrise The colors are juxtaposed which gives the painting an unfinished appearance.

Le Baron Grubicy de Dragon reprendra le thème du soleil de Monet comme un point lumineux et son reflet, dans trois autres œuvres :

Terence

Publius Terentius Afer (fl. 166–160 BC), better known in English as Terence, was a Roman playwright. Terence was the author of six plays, all comedies based on Greek originals by Menander or Apollodorus of Carystus.

According to an ancient biography by Suetonius, Terence was born in Carthage and was brought to Rome as the slave of a senator named Terentius Lucanus, who educated and freed him. Suetonius reports that at about the age of 25, Terence travelled to Greece (or, according to another of Suetonius' sources, Asia Minor), and either died of illness in the east, or died by shipwreck on the return voyage. However, it is highly likely that the only information available to Suetonius about the life of Terence was speculation by earlier scholars who lived too long after Terence to obtain any reliable facts about his biography. Terence' origin as an African slave may have been an inference from his name "Terentius Afer," which means "Terence the African," and the story of Terence' early death may have been invented to explain why he wrote so few plays.

Terence's six plays are:


Ruslan Yunyaev

Ruslan Rishatovich Yunyaev (, born August 17, 1988, Sterlitamak, Bashkortostan, USSR) is a Russian musician, songwriter, journalist, TV correspondent.

Ruslan was born and grew up in a simple working family. His father, Rishat Jamilievich Yunyaev, worked as a pipe-laying machine operator at Lukoil; his mother, Klara Garafutdinovna Fakhretdinov, worked there as a control panel dispatcher.

With the birth of his older brother Ruslan, they moved together from Sterlitamak to Langepas, but five years later Ruslan was born in Bashkiria, where he spent the first years of his life.

From 2004 to 2005, he was a freelance youngster for the local TV company "Langepas". During the period of his work, he created and came up with more than 100 stories on topical issues for the programs "Cheshuya", "Doors", and "Dobrye Novosti".

In 2005, Ruslan entered the faculty of journalism at St. Petersburg State University of Film and Television. During his studies he did not work in his specialty.

At the end of 2009, he created his television project "NEformat", as part of University Television.

When creating the program, he acted as a director, host, scriptwriter, set designer, editor, sound engineer, prepared stories, and selected guests.

Due to Ruslan's first experience, the talk show failed miserably. But despite the merciless criticism of the audience, the program took part in the Open Festival "Generation: A New Look" of SPbSUKiT within the framework of the Week of Science and Creativity of SPbSUKiT, where it was appreciated.

In 2011, he moved to Moscow, where he began his career in television.

After graduating from university, Ruslan moved to Moscow, where he immediately got a job at the NTV TV channel, in the program "Chrezvychaynoye proisshestviye". In parallel, his reports were aired on the Segodnya program.

Since 2012 he has been working in the program "Good Morning", on Channel One.

He released a music single for the first time in 2019 "Ненавижу".

Ruslan has no musical education. As a student, the performer was trained in a vocal studio. At the same time he wrote lyrics for his future songs.

In 2008 the ballad "Ненавижу" was written, a year later the singer wrote the song "Устал, поэтому ушёл". For about 12 years the compositions lay unreleased . Only in 2019, Ruslan decided to return to music, recorded and released these two singles.

In early 2021, work began on the debut music album. Ruslan recovered his lyrics. The music to them was written by the singer and composer Nadia Kodes. In late November 2021, the EP "Первый" was released.

On December 13, 2021, Ruslan released an acoustic version of the album "Первый".

Souvlaki

Souvlaki (, , ; plural: , ) is a Greek food made up of small pieces of meat and sometimes vegetables grilled on a skewer or spit. It is often eaten straight off the skewer while still hot. Souvlaki can be served with or inside a rolled pita, typically with lemon, sauces, vegetables like sliced tomato and onion, and fried potatoes. The meats used are pork, chicken, beef, and lamb.

The word "souvlaki" is a diminutive of the Greek word ( meaning "skewer") itself borrowed from the Latin word .

In Greek culture, the cooking of meat on skewers goes back to the Bronze Age. Sets of cooking supports made of stone were found on the Greek island of Santorini. They were used by the natives to cook souvlaki, "a popular delicacy in Santorini back in 2000 BC", before the volcanic eruption on the island of Thera in the 17th century BC. There are dents in the stone cooking supports likely used for holding skewers and the line of holes in the base allowed the coals to be supplied with air. 

In Mycenaean Greece, "souvlaki trays" were found in Gla, Mycenae, and Pylos. The "souvlaki trays", or portable grills, used by the Mycenaean Greeks were rectangular ceramic pans that sat below skewers of meat. It is unclear whether these trays were put directly over a fire or if the pans held hot coals like a portable barbecue pit. Spit supports used for cooking food appear to "continue in use into the Early Iron Age at Nichoria." In Greek literature, the "Iliad" of Homer mentions pieces of meat cooked on spits called "obelos" (ὀβελός). "Obelos" is also mentioned in the works of Aristophanes, Xenophon, Aristotle, and others. In Classical Greece, a small spit or skewer was called an "obeliskos" (). Aristophanes mentions such small skewers being used to cook birds.

In the Byzantine Empire, the Greek author of the "Prodromic Poems" (4.231) mentions "the hot meat shops" of Constantinople giving customers slices of meat cooked on spits like souvlaki called "".

In modern times, the French traveler Gustave Flaubert saw Greeks "grilling pieces of meat on a bamboo stick" when he visited the Greek countryside of Boeotia in 1850. But modern souvlaki was not widespread in Greece until after World War II. Souvlaki skewers served as fast food began to be sold widely in the 1960s after their introduction by sellers from Boeotia. The word "souvlaki" in the English language was first used in 1942.



Bhagwan Ahir

Bhagwan Ahir (died 1923) was born in Gorakhpur district, Uttar Pradesh. On 4 February 1922, an incident occurred outside the Chaura police station in Gorakhpur district, where a group of constables and watchmen clashed with a crowd of 2000-2500 peasants from neighboring villages. Most of the crowd did not have any weapons. The officer-in-charge of the police station, Gupteshwar Singh, made a fatal mistake by ordering the police to fire first in the air and then at the crowd, resulting in the death of some peasants and injuries to hundreds of others. This incensed the peaceful satyagrahi crowd, who retaliated by killing 22 policemen and chowkidars, and setting the police station on fire. 

Bhagwan Ahir was born in Gorakhpur district, Uttar Pradesh in a landlord family to Ram Nath Ahir.

Bhagwan Ahir played a prominent role in the events that followed. He was a leading volunteer and drill instructor who taught others to march in formation and follow whistle commands. According to witness accounts, he brought thatching grass to burn the police station, helped to carry the body of the Sub-Inspector to the flames, and participated in the beating of constables who were subsequently killed. He was also accused of leading the volunteer crowd.

Bhagwan Ahir was found guilty under section 302/149 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to death by the session court. He appealed to the High Court, but his appeal was rejected and he was executed in July 1923.

Ahir and the events of the police station incident are the basis for the 2023 movie "1922 Pratikaar Chauri Chaura."

Monodontidae

Monodontidae is a small group of toothed whales with two species: the narwhal (Monodon monoceros) and the beluga (Delphinapterus leucas). These marine mammals are known for their unique characteristics, distribution, and importance in nature.

Monodontidae is in the Cetacea order, which includes all whales, dolphins, and porpoises. It's part of the toothed whale suborder Odontoceti, specifically in the superfamily Delphinoidea. Monodontidae shares this category with other families like Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins) and Phocoenidae (porpoises).

Narwhals have a tusk, a long tooth growing up to 10 feet (~3 meters) long, mainly seen in males. Female tusks are smaller and cone-shaped. They have spotted gray/brown skin for camouflage and are medium-sized, about 13 to 18 feet (4 to 5.4 meters) long.

Identified by their white color and round forehead or melon. They lack dorsal fins, helping in icy waters. Belugas reach 13 to 20 feet (4 to 6 meters) long, with males usually being larger. 

Narwhals and belugas live in the Arctic and subarctic regions of the northern hemisphere. Narwhals inhabit the Canadian Arctic, Greenland, and Russian waters. Belugas have a wider range from the Arctic Ocean to subarctic regions like the Bering Sea and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. 

Both species are social and vocal. Belugas are famous for varied vocalizations like clicks, whistles, and other sounds, important for communication and navigation in their often dark habitats. They prefer shallow coastal waters and migrate based on ice and prey changes.

Monodontids feed on fish, squid, and crustaceans, adapted to their cold-water homes. They use echolocation (high-frequency clicks that bounce off objects) to locate prey by echo, detecting prey size, shape, and location.

IUCN lists narwhals and belugas as least concern, but climate change and habitat loss are potential threats. Shrinking Arctic ice due to warming affects ice-covered hunting/resting areas. Human activities like shipping and resource extraction generate noise pollution, impacting their communication and navigation.

Estonian War of Independence

The Estonian War of Independence was an armed conflict between the Republic of Estonia and Soviet Russia that lasted from November 28 , 1918 to February 2, 1920. There was also the Landesveer War, fought in southern Estonia and northern Latvia between June 5 and July 3, 1919, against the Baltic German forces. 

The troops of the German Empire, which occupied the territory of Estonia during the First World War, left Estonia due to the end of the World War. Taking advantage of the favorable situation, Soviet Russia decided to take over the Estonian territories again. The Red Army's attack on Narva on November 28, 1918 was the beginning of the war. The city was captured and the underequipped and significantly outnumbered units of the Estonian National Army were defeated.

On November 20, the Deputy Foreign Minister of the United Kingdom Robert Cecil, expressed support for Estonia and promised military help. On December 12, the British ships under the command of Admiral Sir Edwyn Alexander-Sinclair arrived from Liepaja for a raid on Tallinn. The arrival of the fleet succeeded in the second attempt. In the first attempt, the light cruiser HMS Cassandra was sunk by a mine near Saaremaa, and the fleet turned back. They delivered 6,500 rifles, 200 machine guns, and two field guns. 

By the end of 1918, the 7th Red Army controlled Estonia along the front line 34 kilometers east of Tallinn, west from Tartu and south of Ainaži.

By the beginning of 1919, the Estonian Army had 13,000 men. A 1,000-strong Finnish-Estonian force landed at Utria behind the Soviet 6th Rifle Division on 17 January. Narva was liberated the next day. The Estonians used armoured trains very successfully.

The British fleet brought weapons and equipment to Estonia and protected the northern coast of Estonia until January 5, 1919 , when it left the Baltic Sea . USA helped Estonia primarily with humanitarian aid.

On December 31, 1919, Estonia and Soviet Russia concluded an armistice, which entered into force on January 3, 1920. The official end of the war came with the Treaty of Tartu on February 2, 1920 . With this, Soviet Russia recognized the independence of Estonia and forever renounced all rights that Russia had regarding the land and people of Estonia. 

Movie camera

Movie cameras / video cameras are used to film movies. Movie cameras take pictures very quickly, and they usually take 24 or 25 pictures, or frames every second.

Sound is usually recorded at the same time as the pictures are, but sometimes they are added later. The sounds in a movie are usually people talking, the soundtrack, and sound effects. In the 20th century the camera used photographic films.

Road signs in Japan

In Japan, road signs (道路標識, dōro-hyōshiki) are standardized by the "Order on Road Sign, Road Line, and Road Surface Marking (道路標識、区画線及び道路標示に関する命令)" established in 1968 with origins from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's "Order on Standardization of Road Sign" of 1934 and the Home Ministry of Japan's "Order on Road Signs" of 1942. The previous designs have been used since 1986 after several amendments of order.

 are usually put just below the principal signs, and shows their valid range like time, day and category of vehicle. They are equivalent to the "plaque" of the American MUTCD. The width of the plates is usually 60 cm, and the sentences should be less than 7 characters per a line or 3 lines. When the sentences can not be shortened less than the limitation, they should apply changeable signs.

The first standardised road signage schemes appeared in 1922. At first, two types of signs were established: "road warning signs" equivalent to warning signs and "road guide signs" as information signs.
Warning signs at that time closely resembled the British design as used in Hong Kong, the only difference was the white-on-black lettering.

Japanese road signs in the early 1940s closely followed European road signage practices at that time based on the 1931 Geneva Convention, except that most road signages contained text. A variation of the early 1940s Japanese road signage system is still in use today in Taiwan.

In 1950, a complete revision of the "Road Signs Ordinance" was promulgated and enforced as an Ordinance of the Prime Minister's Office and the Ministry of Construction. Unlike the 1922 and the 1940s devised road signs, it included both bilingual Japanese and English text and symbols. Warning signs were changed from a European red-bordered triangular design to an American MUTCD yellow diamond design. This road signage system was used until 1963, when it was replaced with a new road signage system that is based on the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals. The present-day Japanese road signage system also replaced the stop sign's shape with an inverted equilateral triangle like the stop sign used in West Germany from the 1945 to 1971.

In 2016, it was announced that the Japanese National Police Agency was considering changing the design of the "Stop" sign used on Japanese roads since 1963 from the inverted red triangle sign to an octagonal design more closely conforming to the recommendations of the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals. The inverted red triangle sign was introduced in 1963 ahead of the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games, and replaced the earlier red octagonal sign used from 1960, which in turn had replaced the yellow octagonal sign used from 1950. It was later decided to make the stop sign bilingual in both Japanese and English, but to maintain the inverted triangular shape.

Raorchestes chotta

The small bush frog ("Raorchestes chotta") is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in only one place: Ponmudi in the Western Ghat mountains. People have seen it between 600 and 980 meters above sea level.

People have seen this frog in evergreen forests and on one tea farm. This frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog and is never a tadpole.

Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in a small place and people are changing this place in ways that make it harder for the frog to live there. People change the forests into farms for tea and areca nut. One of the places this frog lives is a park: Ponmudi Reserve Forest.

Scientists think the fungus "Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis" could makethis frog sick because it can make other frogs in "Raorchestes" sick, but they are not sure.

In August 2023, Binkley announced his candidacy for President of the United States in the 2024 election. He ended his campaign in late February 2024.

Binkley was born in Columbus, Georgia. He has a Bachelor of Business Administration in Finance and Marketing from the University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business. He also has a Master of Business Administration from Southern Methodist University's Cox School of Business. 

Binkley worked for Procter & Gamble and Boston Scientific before founding his own consulting firm, the Generational Equity Group, in 2006.

A member of the Republican Party, Binkley announced in April 2023 that he would seek the party's nomination for the 2024 United States presidential election. Binkley said he was called to run for president by God. He said a message came through to him about seven years ago telling him that the nation is in trouble. Binkley has built his campaign around "solutions for the country" criticizing both Republicans and Democrats for being overly partisan. His four major planks include: balancing the federal budget, driving down health care costs, reaching across the aisle to reform immigration policy and "revitalizing education" to encourage community involvement. Binkley has branded himself as a "uniter" for the Republican Party that can bridge the pro and anti-Trump divide.

Binkley has been centering his campaign in Iowa, where the first caucus is held, speaking with the local media, and buying $250,000 in radio advertisements. He also held a town hall meeting in Waterloo, Iowa where he said the Republican values touted in the 2022 United States elections didn't resonate with voters and reiterating that most Americans support the status quo, and that national debt and the economy were more important than social issues. He is considered a "longshot" for the nomination and has been having trouble differentiating himself from other candidates while on the campaign trail in Iowa.

He spoke at the Republican Party of Iowa's Lincoln Dinner on July 28, an important platform for candidates in the state.

Binkley has consistently visited Iowa and planned to visit New Hampshire and either Texas or South Carolina, trying to collect donors to be able to qualify for the first Republican debate to be held on August 23, 2023, in Milwaukee.

Binkley has been largely self-funding his campaign, while also appealing for donors to help him reach the donor criteria required to participate in the 2024 RNC-sanctioned debates. Binkley met the donor threshold on August 20, but has only one qualifying poll out of the four required to participate. He ultimately did not qualify for the first debate.

Binkley said that he was continuing his candidacy through the caucuses. He was the first candidate to visit every county in Iowa, dubbed "the full Grassley"

Binkley received less than 800 votes in the 2024 Iowa Caucuses, after spending over $3,000,000 (including $500,000 in the last two weeks), which is a cost per vote average of over $4,000 per vote. His vote total was surprising. Even as a low-polling candidate, Binkley was able to earn more votes than former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson.

He suspended his campaign on the day of the Michigan primary and endorsed Trump on February 27, 2024.

His wife, Ellie, is from South Korea and the couple have five children.

Raorchestes griet

The Greit bush frog or Munnar common bush frog ("Raorchestes griet") is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen this frog in one place: a valley in the Western Ghat mountains, about 1500 meters above sea level. People have seen it between 600 and 2000 meters above sea level.

People have seen this frog in forests on mountains. Some of the forests had been cut down and were growing back. People have seen the frog near shola forests and on tea farms. Scientists believe this frog needs woody plants smaller than tall trees to live.

The adult male frog is about 20.7-22.1 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is brown in color.

The eggs hatch into small frogs. They never swim as tadpoles.

There are fewer of this frog than there were in 1999. Scientists say this frog is at some risk of dying. This is because human beings change the places where the frog lives. This frog lives in trees and humans cut down the trees to make farms for tea and eucalyptus. People have seen the frogs on some of the eucalyptus trees, but scientists do not think the frogs can live there the way some other frogs can live on farms.

Scientists say the biggest problem for this frog is cutting down trees but human beings also bother the frog. Many people take a religious trip to the forests where the frog lives. The fungus "Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis" can make other frogs in "Raorchestes" sick, so scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis might kill this frog. Scientists also think climate change could kill this frog.

Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks: Meghamalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Eravikulam National Park, Kodaikanal Wildlife Sanctuary, Anamalai Tiger Reserve and Periyar Tiger Reserve.

The Ochlandrae reed frog ("Raorchestes ochlandrae") is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen this frog in one place: Kakkayam Reserve Forest in the Western Ghat mountains, about 745 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is about 22.1–25.6 mm long from nose to rear end and one adult female frog was 23.3 mm long. Its body is long and flat. The skin of its back is brown to cream to yellow in color with two yellow marks from its eyes to the backs of its legs. 

There are fewer of this frog than there were years ago. Scientists think this could be because human beings build dams that stop water where the frogs live.

Souliotes

The Souliotes () are the bilingual Greek people of a village confederation called "Souli" (). They lived in the mountains of Epirus in northwestern Greece. Souliotes fought in the Greek revolution of 1821 against the Ottoman Empire and its allies.

The origins of the name "Souli" are unclear. 

Souliotes spoke Greek and a southern dialect of Albanian called Tosk. They only used Greek in their writings.

Ottoman oppression forced Greek herders in Epirus to flee to the mountains during the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th century. There, they built a confederation of villages called the "Tetrachori" (, "Four Villages") also known as "Souli". The Souliotes resisted Ottoman rule during the 18th century. They later participated in the Orlov Revolt, a failed Greek anti-Ottoman uprising that happened in the 1770s. 

When the Souliotes were betrayed to the Ottomans in 1803, some abandoned Souli while others killed themselves. Among those who killed themselves were the women of Souli who threw themselves and their children off a cliff called Zaloggo in an event called the "Dance of Zaloggo" (). During the Greek revolution of 1821, the Souliotes defeated the Ottomans at the battle of the Five Wells in September of 1821.


Raorchestes nerostagona

The Kalpatta yellow bush frog ("Raorchestes nerostagona") is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen this frog about 1000 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is about 34.0 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is lught brown in color with red-brown marks. The sides of the frog's body are blue-black in color with brown marks. The eardrum is light brown with some green marks. All four feet are gray in color. The belly is off-white with some brown and gray. The frog's mouth is white in color. The iris of the eye is red-gray in color with some brown. This frog can look like the lichen that grows on trees. This makes it hard to see. The feet have webbing all the way to the toes. There are discs on its toes for climbing. The discs are oval in shape.

This frog lives high in trees where the branches meet each other. When the male frog sings for the female frogs, hsi voice sounds like a drop of water. The female frog lays 40 eggs at a time. She lays the eggs high in the trees.

Like other frogs in "Raorchestes", they hatch from their eggs as frogs. They never swim as tadpoles.

This frog is in danger of dying out. This is because human beings change the places where it lives. Human beings cut down the trees to get wood to build with or to make farms or places for animals to eat grass.

Her movies and photographs are in a number of international public and private collections including IMMA, The Arts Council of Ireland, The OPW, the Tony Podesta Private Collection, Washington, and the Hugo and Carla Brown Collection, UK. 

For the last 20 years, Langan's movies deal with existential issues, where humanity and our relationship to the planet and climate have always been at the fore. Her first trilogy – "Forty Below" (1999), "Too Dark for Night" (2001), and "Glass Hour ("2002) – were shot in a drowned world; in the town being consumed by the desert, and across a molten volcanic landscape. With Langan's 2015 movie "Flight from the City" made for the late Icelandic composer Johann Johannsson, the camera was turned from focus on the landscape, to focus on humanity itself. Since then the work has combined elements of choreography, landscape, performance with music being a crucial element of the works. "Flight from the City" premiered at the "B3 Biennale of the Moving Image 2015" in Frankfurt, before touring to Beijing and Shanghai. Jóhann Jóhannsson went on to use "Flight from the City" to launch his 2016 album "Orphee."

Langan has made movies in Namibia, Iceland, at Skellig Michael, in the sky above the city of Dubai, and on the largely abandoned island of Montserrat. Langan started making movies in the late 1990s on 16mm film. She use hand-painted glass filters that workedlike eyelids. Later, she started using unusual film stock, including black and white infra-red. 

Her movie "Metamorphosis ("2007) won the Principal Prize at the "Oberhausen International Short Film Festival," Germany. In 2007 it was exhibited at the Lyon Biennale; Houldsworth Gallery, London; "Loop," Barcelona; NCA Gallery, Tokyo; Pratt Art Gallery New York and the Miguel Marcos Gallery, Barcelona. Langan's "State of Suspension" (2012) was shown in Galerie Anita Beckers, Frankfurt, and The Rubicon Gallery, Dublin. She participated in the "Glen Dimplex Artists’ Award 2000" at The Irish Museum of Modern Art.

"The Floating World" premiered at Kino der Kunst in 2013, where it was really well received by the jury and the audience. The film went on to win the "Prix Videoformes 2014 | Conseil Général du Puy de Dôme" at "VIDEOFORMES 2014," Clermont-Ferrand, France. It was exhibited as a 3-screen installation in VISUAL Center of Contemporary Art in 2015, and has since been exhibited in "Städtische Galerie", Delmenhorst, Germany and "The Tom Tomson Art Gallery", Canada, where she also exhibited "The Winter of 13 Storms," (2016/17). This movie was also exhibited at the B3 Biennal of the Moving Image Frankfurt 2017 curated by Kelly Gordon.

In 2017, she exhibited her movie "The Human Flock" at Lismore Castle Arts, Waterford. The movie travelled to "Dirimart," Istanbul in July 2018, as part of "The Best of Kino der Kunst" curated by Heinz Peter Schwerfel.

Recent festivals include "Ritratti Di Poesia", Poetry Festival, Rome alongside the poets Kate Tempest and Ingrid de Kok, and "Physical Cinema" Festival, in Reykjavk. In 2020, her movie "The Heart of a Tree" premiered at Kino Der Kunst, Munich. "The Heart of a Tree" was then part of Lightmoves Film Festival, Limerick in 2021 before being part of Fondazione In Between Art Film in 2022.

In 2021, her movie"Flight from the City" (2015) was screened as part of Artist Film International (AFI). In 2022, Langan's movie "River" (2015) was part of Living Canvas, Dublin City's new cultural program by IPUT.

Taverna

A taverna (Greek: ταβέρνα) is a small Greek restaurant that serves Greek food. It is an important part of Greek culture. The taverna has become familiar to foreign visitors to Greece and through the building of tavernes (, plural) in countries such as the United States and Australia by Greeks.

The word "taverna" () is borrowed from the Latin word "taberna" meaning “shop” or "inn". 

The earliest Greek restaurant was discovered in ancient Athens by archaeologists in the early 1970s. Large amounts of cooking and eating utensils were found at the taverna like plates, mixing bowls, lidded casseroles, spits for broiling meat, mortars for chopping and grinding along with a cooking bell and many different jugs. Large amounts of seafood were also found like oysters, mussels, murex, and large fish. A nearby wine shop, maybe connected to the restaurant, served local Attic wine and many other wines imported from Chios, Mende, Corinth, Samos and Lesbos.

There were also shops serving wine in the Byzantine Empire. This is known from a 10th-century Byzantine curfew meant to prevent drunken "violence and rioting".

A typical menu for a modern taverna often includes:


Tavernes usually open at noon with dinner hours starting at 20:00 and reaching a peak around 22:00. As tourism has grown in Greece, many tavernes have attempted to cater to foreign visitors with English menus and "shills" being hired in many tavernes to attract passing tourists. Tavernes in tourist areas pay commissions to tour guides who send business their way.

The main character in the play and film "Shirley Valentine" written by Willy Russell leaves her husband and family in Liverpool for a vacation where she has an affair with a waiter at the taverna and ends up working in the taverna.

Palacký University Olomouc

Palacký University Olomouc is the oldest university in Moravia and the second-oldest in the Czech Republic. It started in 1573 as a public university led by the Jesuit order in Olomouc. Olomouc then was the capital of Moravia and the seat of the bishop. At first it taught only theology, but then philosophy, law and medicine were added.

After the Bohemian King Joseph II's reforms to the church in the 1770s it became a public university. University students and professors were active in the Revolution of 1848 on the side of democratisation. Then the conservative king Francis Joseph I closed most of the university during the 1850s. Only the independent Faculty of Theology and the independent University Library stayed open. After the German invasion in 1939, all the Czech Universities were closed. It was reopened by an act of the Interim National Assembly in February 1946. This act also changed the name from "University of Olomouc" to "Palacký University Olomouc", after František Palacký, a 19th-century Moravian historian and politician.

The city of Olomouc has more university students for its size than anywhere else in Central Europe. There are about 25,000 university students (including those at Moravian College Olomouc), compared to a population of 100,000 inhabitants. Notable people from the university include Albrecht von Wallenstein and Gregor Mendel.

Mariona Caldentey

María Francesca Caldentey Oliver (born 19 March 1996, often known as Mariona Caldentey or simply Mariona, is a professional football player from Spain. Her dad, Miguel Ángel Caldentey, was a coach for football, and her mum, María Oliver, works as a nurse. Mariona has an older brother in her family.

From a very young age of four, Mariona showed a keen interest in playing football. She started playing football after school. She also enjoyed a variation of football known as futsal in Manacor. In futsal, she achieved great success, winning many awards and taking part in three Spanish championships. Mariona's journey in football started with local teams like CD Felanitx and CD CIDE. At the age of 14, she got the chance to play in an all-women's team for the first time with UD Collerense. Her skills improved during her time there. In 2014, Mariona's impressive performance in the U19 European Championship caught the attention of FC Barcelona, and she joined the team on 30 July 2014. During the 2014–2015 season, she made her debut in the Copa de la Reina tournament, scoring a goal in a match against Levante.

Mariona also represented Spain in youth tournaments. She played in the U17 European Championship in 2013, where Spain secured third place. She played a significant role in the U19 European Championship in 2014, where she scored a goal in the semifinals.

Mariona's hard work paid off in 2017 when she received her first call-up to the senior national team of Spain. She made her debut in an Algarve Cup match against Japan. Spain went on to win the tournament, giving Mariona her first international title. Mariona continued to contribute to the Spanish national team's successes. She played in the Euro 2017 tournament and the 2019 Algarve Cup. She also participated in the 2019 World Cup, where Spain reached the Round of 16.

In the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup final, she played a crucial role as Spain defeated England 1–0, securing their first-ever trophy.

Electrical wiring in the United Kingdom

Electrical wiring in the UK refers to setups in buildings like homes, offices, and factories for using electricity. This also includes special places like marinas. But it doesn't include sending electricity over long distances. These setups differ based on factors like voltage, phase, cable type, and circuit design.

Rules for electrical wiring safety are overseen by regulations like the Building Regulations 2010 and the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989. These rules specify standards for things like wiring. The specific guidelines are found in BS 7671 Requirements for Electrical Installations (IET Wiring Regulations), currently in its 18th edition.

As of 2006, the standard wiring colors in the UK are the same as in the rest of Europe, following the international standard IEC 60446. This color pattern was initially used for appliance cords in the UK in the early 1970s. However, the original red/black color scheme recommended by the IEE for permanent wiring was used until 2006, though a change to a green/yellow striped wire for grounding was made in 1976. The international standard blue/brown scheme is now commonly seen in most appliance cords. In permanent wiring, the blue/brown arrangement is only present in newer installations after 2004, and the old IEE red/black scheme is likely to continue in existing installations for many more years.

The standard colours in fixed wiring were harmonised in 2004 with the regulations in other European countries and the international IEC 60446 standard. For a transitional period (April 2004 – March 2006) either set of colours were allowed (but not both), provided that any changes in the colour scheme are clearly labelled. From April 2006, only the new colours should be used for any new wiring.

Waterfox

Waterfox is a free and open-source browser based on Firefox. It was first made for 64-bit systems, back when Firefox was only for 32-bit. Now, it is focused on speed and privacy.

Waterfox Current is almost the same as Firefox. They both use Gecko and SpiderMonkey to show websites. It also works with Firefox, Chrome, and Opera extensions. It turns off telemetry (data collection) and Pocket (web service). But, it collects details about the user's device to send the right updates (new changes) to the user's browser.

Waterfox Classic is a copy of the browser that uses the older copy of Gecko that still works with XUL and XPCOM add-ons. These add-ons do not work anymore on copies after Firefox 57. The browser can also be easily seen as similar to Firefox 57, showing the default Australis theme.

It is still being kept up with the security changes from Waterfox Current and Firefox ESR. But, it has some security problems that are not fixed yet. This is because some new changes would not work on it. 

On March 27, 2011, Waterfox was first posted and distributed (given) by Alex Kontos for 64-bit Windows. The copy for Mac was posted on May 14, 2015, after version 38.0 was posted. The copy for Linux was posted on December 20, 2016, after version 50.0 was posted. 

From July 22, 2015, to November 12, 2015, Waterfox had its search engine called "Storm" based on Yahoo! Search. It was made with investor funding and it raised money for Waterfox and charity (giving money to the needy).

In December 2019, System1, an advertising (paid notice) company that claims to be focused on privacy, bought Waterfox. In July 2023, Alex Kontos said that Waterfox is an independent and separate project again.

Operation Swift Retort (short movie)

Operation Swift Retort is a Pakistani animated movie about the 2019 airstrikes in Jammu and Kashmir. It was directed, produced, and animated by DJ Kamal Mustafa and aims to show the truth about the Indian airstrike in Balakot and the Pakistan Air Force's response.

The idea for the movie came to Kamal Mustafa in 2019 after the Pakistan Air Force shot down two Indian jets. It was the first animated movie in Pakistan about dogfights, jet fights, and military responses. The Pakistan Air Force named this operation "Operation Swift Retort". Several important organizations, such as the ISPR and the Pakistan Air Force, gave permission to start production of the film in May 2019. The film was not funded by any organization and was produced as a non-profit project. The total budget of the movie was $700, which was entirely funded by the filmmaker himself. The film was dedicated to Lieutenant General Asif Ghafoor (DG ISPR) at that time. The movie "Operation Swift Retort" was the first animated movie in Pakistan about a dogfight and was an only single animated film which was released in whole Pakistan.

Raorchestes luteolus

The Coorg yellow bush frog or blue-eyed yellow bush frog ("Raorchestes luteolus") is a frog. It lives in southern India. Scientists have seen it in the Western Ghat mountains between 500 and 700 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is about 26.8 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is yellow or yellow-brown in color with light stripes that are not easy to see. The male frog turns yellow when it is time to find female frogs who will lay eggs. It turns cream-white at other times of year.

This frog lives in forests and in Myristica swamps on the mountains. It sits on plants about 1 meter above the ground.

21 grams experiment

The 21 grams experiment was a scientific study. It was published in 1907. The author was Duncan MacDougall. He was a physician from Haverhill, Massachusetts. MacDougall thought that souls have physical weight. He tried to measure the mass lost by a human when the soul left the body. MacDougall tried to measure the mass change of six patients at the moment of death. One of the six subjects lost three-quarters of an ounce (21.3 grams).

MacDougall said his experiment would have to be repeated many times before any conclusion could be obtained. The experiment is not considered good science. This is because of the small sample size, the methods used, and the fact only one of the six subjects met the hypothesis. The case has been used as an example of selective reporting. Despite its rejection by scientists, MacDougall’s experiment made people think that the soul has weight. Specifically, that it weighs 21 grams.

In 1901, Duncan MacDougall wanted to find out if a soul had weight. He found six patients in nursing homes who were going to die soon. Four had tuberculosis, one had diabetes, and one had other causes. MacDougall chose people who were very tired because of their illness. He needed them to be still when they died so he could measure them accurately. When the patients were close to death, their whole bed was put on a big scale. The scale was sensitive within two tenths of an ounce (5.6 grams). MacDougall thought that humans have souls but animals do not. So he later measured the weight changes of fifteen dogs after they died. MacDougall wanted to use sick or dying dogs for his experiment. But he could not find any. So it is thought that he poisoned healthy dogs.

One patient lost weight. But then gained it back again. Two other patients lost weight at death. But then lost even more weight a few minutes later. One patient lost “three-fourths of an ounce” (21.3 grams) in weight at the time of death. MacDougall did not count the results of another patient because the scales were “not finely adjusted”. He also did not count the results of another patient because the patient died while the equipment was being set up. MacDougall said that none of the dogs lost any weight after death.

MacDougall thought that his experiment showed that the human soul might have weight. But his report said that the experiment would have to be done many times before any conclusion could be reached. The report was not published until 1907.

"The New York Times" wrote about the experiment before MacDougall could publish the results. The article was called “Soul has Weight, Physician Thinks”. MacDougall’s results were published in April of the same year. They were in the "Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research", and the medical journal "American Medicine".

After the experiment was published in "American Medicine", physician Augustus P. Clarke criticized it. Clarke said that at the time of death, the body temperature suddenly rises. This is because the lungs are not cooling blood anymore. This causes more sweating which could explain MacDougall’s missing 21 grams. Clarke also said that dogs do not have sweat glands. So they would not lose weight this way after death. Clarke’s criticism was published in the May issue of "American Medicine". Arguments between MacDougall and Clarke argued about the experiment in the journal until at least December that year.

The scientific community has rejected MacDougall’s experiment. He has been accused of using bad methods and even cheating to get his results. Karl Kruszelnicki said that this is a case of selective reporting, This is because only one of the six patients measured supported the hypothesis. MacDougall also ignored most of the results. Kruszelnicki also said that the sample size was too small. He asked how MacDougall could know the exact moment when a person died with the technology at that time. Physicist Robert L. Park said that MacDougall’s experiments are not considered good science “today”. Psychologist Bruce Hood said that the weight loss was not reliable or repeated, so MacDougall’s findings were not scientific. Professor Richard Wiseman said that scientists think the experiment is “almost certainly not true”.

An article by Snopes in 2013 said that the experiment was flawed. The methods used were not good, the sample size was too small, and it was not possible to measure weight changes accurately. The article said that we should not believe that his experiments proved anything, “let alone that they measured the weight of the soul as 21 grams.” The fact that MacDougall probably poisoned and killed fifteen healthy dogs to support his research has also been criticized.

In 1911, "The New York Times" reported that MacDougall wanted to do experiments to take photos of souls. But he did not continue any more research into this area and died in 1920. His experiment has not been done again.

In December 2001, physicist Lewis E. Hollander Jr. published an article. It was in "Journal of Scientific Exploration." He showed the results of a similar experiment. He tested the weight of one male sheep, seven female sheep, three young sheep and one goat at the moment of death. He wanted to learn more about MacDougall’s findings. His experiment showed that seven of the adult sheep changed their weight when they died. But they did not lose weight, they gained weight. They gained between 18 and 780 grams. This weight was lost again over time until they returned to their first weight. In 2009, Masayoshi Ishida reviewed Hollander Jr.'s experiment in the same journal. Ishida said that Hollander’s statement about a temporary gain of weight was not a good way to describe the result. But he said that the cause of the force event is still not known. He also warned about possible problems with the weighing platform in two cases.

Another person who was inspired by MacDougall’s research was physician Gerard Nahum. In 2005, he suggested a new experiment. It would use many electromagnetic detectors to try to find any energy that escaped at the moment of death. He offered to sell his idea to engineering, physics, and philosophy departments at Yale, Stanford, and Duke University. He also offered it to the Catholic Church. But they all said no.

Even though scientists do not accept it as true, MacDougall’s experiment made people think that the soul has weight. Specifically, that it weighs 21 grams. The movie "21 Grams" is named after the experiment.

The idea that a soul weighs 21 grams has been mentioned in many media. For example, in a 2013 issue of the manga "Gantz", a 2013 podcast of "Welcome to Night Vale", the 2015 movie "The Empire of Corpses" a 2021 episode of "Ted Lasso", and a 2023 issue of the manga "One Piece". There are also songs called “21 Grams” that talk about the weight of a soul. These songs were released by Looptroop Rockers (2005), Niykee Heaton (2015), Fedez (2015), August Burns Red (2015), Thundamentals (2017) and Arena (2022). Travis Scott mentioned the idea in his 2018 song “No Bystanders”. MacDougall and his experiments are talked about in the 1978 documentary movie "Beyond and Back", and episode five of the season one of "". A made-up American scientist named “Mr. MacDougall” is in Gail Carriger's 2009 novel "Soulless". Mr. MacDougall is an expert in measuring souls.

Ptyctodontida

The Ptyctodontida are an order of Devonian chimaera-like placoderms containing the family Ptyctodontidae. They are the only placoderms to be sexually dimorphic. Some paleontologists believe that they may have been an early ancestor of modern-day sharks. 

According to The Content Authority, they are cartilaginous fishes, but this is not commonly accepted by many people because we believe they are placoderms. It means "folded teeth" in Latin. Like today's cartilaginous fish, they had the possession of claspers.

"Main article: Eczematolepis"

"Main article: Ctenurella"

"Main article: Materpiscis"

"Materpiscis" (Latin for "mother fish") is a genus of ptyctodontid placoderm from the late Devonian period, about 380 million years ago.

"Main article: Campbellodus"

"Main article: Ptyctodus"

"Ptyctodus" is the type genus of this order and family.

"Main article: Kimbryanodus"

Ptyctodontids resembled the modern-day chimaeras of the Holocephali, like the acanthothoracids. They had big heads, big eyes, reduced armor and long bodies.

"Campbellodus" resembled a scaly cardboard box with the tail of a halosaur. It did not resemble a holocephalian at all, but it is still a ptyctodont.

"Kimbryanodus" resembled an arthrodire, again with a halosaur's tail. The fossils occur as small three dimensional isolated plates.

The Russian Federal Air Transport Agency said that the passenger list included the names of the leader of the Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin and its co-founder, Dmitri Utkin. It is likely that both Prigozhin and Utkin were on the aircraft. On 27 August, the Russian Investigative Committee used DNA testing to confirm the identities of all the crash victims, including Prigozhin.

The airplane was first registered in Slovenia as S5-ALS and then had different owners. Prigozhin purchased it in 2020 or 2018. The US didn't let the plane enter because Prigozhin was under sanctions for being involved in interference with 2018 United States elections.

The plane was also linked to taking Prigozhin to Belarus in the aftermath of the Wagner Group rebellion.

According to Flightradar24.com, the airplane was (already) flying at 15:00 UTC. At 15:11, it was 8,500 m up. It stayed at this height until 15:19. Then, it climbed to 9,200 m. Next, it went down to 8,400 m and up to 8,900 m.

The airplane crashed in Kuzhenkino, Tver Oblast, about 60 miles (100 km) north of where it took off in Moscow.

Prigozhin, Utkin and eight other people died in the crash as suggested by the flight records and later confirmed by DNA analysis of the bodies.

Following the plane crash, allegations that Russian President Vladimir Putin or the Russian Ministry of Defense orchestrated the crash to assassinate Prigozhin as punishment for the Wagner Group rebellion in June 2023. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy publicly claimed that Putin was behind the crash, while United States President Joe Biden heavily implied it.

Vladimir Putin denied that the Russian government had any involvement in the crash, claiming the allegations were an "absolute lie." The Russian government instead alleged that Ukraine had assassinated Prigozhin, likely as revenge for the Battle of Bakhmut.

Raorchestes tuberohumerus

The Kudremukh yellow bush frog ("Raorchestes tuberohumerus") is a frog. It lives in southern India. Scientists have seen it in the Western Ghat mountains. 1000 meters above sea level.

This is a small frog. The adult male frog is about 18 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of its back is brown with yellow spots on the tops of the legs. Some frogs have a mark like an hourglass on their backs. There are large red or yellow marks near where the back legs meet the body. This frog can change color: it is darker during the day than at night, and its marks are clearer.

A part of the front leg bone sticks out. This bone is called the humerus. Scientists think this is the only frog that has a front leg bone like this. This is why they gave the frog the Latin name "tuberohumerus". It means "knobbed humerus bone."

The scientists who wrote the first paper only found male frogs, so they do not know whether the female frogs also have these colors or spiked arm bones.

Scienitsts think this frog looks like "Raorchestes bombayensis" but smaller.

Wicked Witch of the West

The Wicked Witch of the West is a fictional character from the "Oz" series. She is mainly known for being the main antagonist (villain) of "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" and its adaptations, most notably "The Wizard of Oz" 1939 film.

In the books, the Wicked Witch of the West is one of the four main witches in the first "Oz" book. She is the ruler of the Winkie Country and lives in a palace. The Wicked Witch also has one eye, which works like a telescope.

The Wicked Witch of the West is mentioned throughout the book but only makes her first appearance close to the end. The main characters, Dorothy, Tin Man, Scarecrow and the Lion are sent by the Wizard of Oz to kill the Witch.

The Wicked Witch sends wolves, crows and bees to kill the heroes but each fails. Her servants are too scared so she summons the Winged Monkeys to capture them. The Wicked Witch finds out that she cannot kill Dorothy so she enslaves her. The Wicked Witch also develops an obsession with the magical silver slippers that Dorothy is wearing.

The Witch manages to get hold of one slipper, making Dorothy angry. Dorothy throws a bucket of water at the Wicked Witch, causing her to melt.

In the 1939 film, the Wicked Witch is portrayed by Margaret Hamilton. The Witch is given a black dress, a black pointed hat, green skin and a broomstick. This portrayal of witches has become very popular ever since the film has been released.

In this film, the Wicked Witch's sister is the Wicked Witch of the East (their relationship was never explored in the book). She also appears many times in the movie. The character ranks #4 in the American Film Institute's list of "50 Best Villains". 

The Wicked Witch's backstory is the main focus of the musical "Wicked". In this story, she is named Elphaba. A film version of the musical is going to be made with Cynthia Erivo as the Wicked Witch.

Treaty of Tartu (Estonia–Russia)

The Tartu Peace Treaty is an international agreement signed between Estonia and Soviet Russia in Tartu on February 2, 1920. It marked the end of the War of Independence. It fixed Estonia's eastern border, and Soviet Russia recognized the independence of the Republic of Estonia. This was the first time that Estonia was recognised as an independent country. It was the first treaty the soviets signed. 

Before that Estonia had been a province of Imperial Russia since 1721.

Russia gave up "forever all sovereign rights that Russia had regarding the people and land of Estonia". Estonia got rid of all obligations to Russia and got 15 million gold rubles or 11.6 tons of gold from the Russian gold fund. In the 1920s, Soviet Russia sold a large part of the huge reserves of gold and precious metals taken from people and churches to Western countries through the Estonian bank G. Scheel & Co. Many Estonian businessmen and the Estonian state became rich because of this. The Russians did not do everything they agreed to. The things they took from the collections of the University of Tartu were not returned - and still havent been. Some land granted to Estonia by the Treaty is still under Russian control.

After the treaty about 38,000 Estonians moved from Russia to Estonia. More people wanted to move and were stopped by the Russians.

"Abudefduf saxatilis" is found in the Atlantic Ocean. Populations in the western part of the Atlantic Ocean are found from the north eastern coast of the United States south to the Gulf of Mexico, the Bahamas, islands around the Caribbean Sea, the eastern coast of Central and South America all the way to Uruguay. In the eastern Atlantic Ocean, they are found from Portugal, Azores, the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, and western Africa. Where it is found remains unclear in the Mediterranean Sea due to possible confusion with "Abudefduf vaigiensis" and "Abudefduf troschelii".

In the early years of the Estonian War of Independence, Scheel Bank served the Russian White Guard Northwestern Army and the Northwestern Russian government in Estonia.

Under the Tartu Peace Treaty, Estonia allowed Soviet Russia to use Estonia and Estonian ports for duty-free trade. Soviet Russia sold the wealth nationalized, requisitioned or stolen from the former owners. A lot of gold and diamonds were sold through the bank. In the 1920s The Scheel Group arranged foreign loans to Estonian companies, especially the new fuel oil industry. Scheel bought the main breweries.

Indo-Pacific sergeant

The Indo-Pacific sergeant (Abudefduf vaigiensis) is a species of damselfish in the family Pomacentridae. It may also be known as the Sergeant major although this name is usually reserved for the closely related species "Abudefduf saxatilis". The closely related "Abudefduf caudobimaculatus" was formerly thought to be the same as this species and, according to some authorities, is synonymous.

The Indo-Pacific sergeant is found in the Indo-Pacific including the Red Sea. Indian Ocean populations are found in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, Arabia, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Maldives, eastern Africa, Madagascar, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, the Andaman Sea, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Australia. Populations in the Pacific Ocean are found in the Gulf of Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan, the Yellow Sea, the Great Barrier Reef around Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific islands all the way to Hawaii. Likely introduced via Suez Canal in the Mediterranean Sea, where its distribution remains unclear due to possible confusion with "Abudefduf saxatilis" and "Abudefduf troschelii".

"Abudefduf vaigiensis" are white bluish with a yellow top. They have a black spot around their dorsal fin. It has yellow eyes. The dorsal fin on this fish has 13 dorsal spines and 11 to 14 dorsal soft rays. The anal fin on the Indo-Pacific sergeant has 2 anal spines and 11 to 13 anal soft rays. Its maximum recorded size is . Yong fish mature at . Males turn more blue during spawning. Many people confuse this fish for "Abudefduf saxatilis", a closely related species found in the Atlantic Ocean.

They feed on zooplankton, benthic algae, and small invertebrates.

Adults live in coral reefs, tide pools, and rocky reefs. Larva of this species live in the open sea. It is found in tropical and subtropical waters. Depth ranges of are where people encounter this fish.

These fish form large groups (aggregations). In the aggregations, individuals either feed in the midwater or tend their nests.

This fish is found in the aquarium trade.

There have been reports of ciguatera poisoning from this fish.

The larva hatch and drift out in to the pelagic zone. They drift in the waves and grow up until they go to a reef.

Males turn more bluish during spawning. They build nests on rocks or coral ledges. Then, females lay their eggs in the nests and the male fertilizes them. Males guard and aerate the eggs until they hatch.



Abudefduf caudobimaculatus

Abudefduf caudobimaculatus, commonly known as the Okinawa sergeant, is a species of damselfish. They are in the family Pomacentridae. The species is native to the Indo-Pacific. It is believed to live from East Africa to Yakushima and Lord Howe Island. This includes Taiwan, where it lives in the same areas with its congeners "Abudefduf nigrimargo" and "A. vaigiensis"), and Indonesia. The species was first described in 1939. It was later thought to be the same as "Abudefduf vaigiensis." In a 2017 review by Kunto Wibowo of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, Hiroyuki Motomura of the Kagoshima University Museum, and Minoru Toda redescribed the species as a separate species. Even after this, the name is still listed by FishBase and WoRMS as a synonym of "A. vaigiensis".

Abudefduf troschelii

Abudefduf troschelii, the Pacific sergeant major or Panama sergeant major, is a species of damselfish belonging to the family Pomacentridae that can be identified by the highly visable black stripes on the sides of the fish. Its specific name honors the zoologist Franz Hermann Troschel (1810-1882). It is native to the neritic pelagic zone of the shallow water coral reefs in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and they are an omnivorous (mesat and vegetable eating) species feeding on plankton and algae attached to their coral habitat. "Abudefduf troschelii" is a sister-species of "A. saxatilis". Males, like in many other marine species, take care of and defend newborn "A. troschelii" after they have been hatched by eggs from the female. There are currently no major threats to the species and there is no indication of a current decline in its population size. The IUCN Red List lists this damselfish as being of “least concern”.

Rich Men North of Richmond

"Rich Men North of Richmond" is a song by American folk singer Oliver Anthony. It was released in August 2023. The song became very popular fast. It was the number 1 on the "Billboard" Hot 100. This means that Anthony is the first artist to do this without Billboard success before.

The song was first uploaded to YouTube on August 8, 2023. It had 5 million views in three days. Anthony self-recorded songs on his cell phone before. "Rich Men North of Richmond" was Anthony's first professional song. The song lyrics mentioned working long hours, but not being payed much.

In a video explaining his songwriting, Anthony said that his lyrics are attempting to speak for the working class and that he aspires to be a "voice for those people", noting that "whatever it is they're doing, they can't quite get ahead". Anthony has described his politics as "dead center". The song was played at a debate for the Republican presidential primary. Anthony said he did not like this because the song critiques them.

"Rich Men North of Richmond" was at the number one spot on "Billboard" Hot 100 on August 26, 2023, with 147,000 downloads and 17.5 million streams that week.

Pomacentridae

Pomacentridae is a family of ray-finned fish, being made up of the damselfishes and clownfishes. This family were formerly placed in the order Perciformes but are now seen as being "incertae sedis" in the subseries Ovalentaria in the clade Percomorpha.
They are mostly marine, while a few species inhabit freshwater and brackish environments (e.g., "Neopomacentrus aquadulcis", "N. taeniurus", "Pomacentrus taeniometopon", "Stegastes otophorus"). They are noted for their hardy constitutions (body functions) and territoriality (where they live). Many are brightly colored, so they are popular in aquaria.

Around 385 species are classified in this family, in about 31 genera. Of these, members of two genera, "Amphiprion" and "Premnas", are commonly called clownfish or anemonefish, while members of other genera (e.g., "Pomacentrus") are commonly called damselfish. The members of this family are classified in four subfamilies: Amphiprioninae, Chrominae, Lepidozyginae, and Pomacentrinae.


Eesti Pank

Eesti Pank (Estonian Bank) is the central bank of the Republic of Estonia. It was started in 1919. Before that there was a branch of the State Bank of the Russian Empire started in Tallinn in 1875. Eesti Pank took over its building. The bank organised printing the notes and coins of the Estonian mark. In 1928 the Estonian kroon took the place of the mark. The bank managed the new currency. It was on the gold standard. The bank had branches in other Estonian cities.

In 1940, Eesti Pank was nationalized and reorganized into the Estonian republican office of the State Bank of the Soviet Union Estonian kroons were changed for rubles.

In 1989 the Eesti Pank was started again as an independent issuing bank. It also gave operating licenses to the 42 commercial banks in Estonia.

At the beginning of 2011, Estonia was the seventeenth country to adopt the euro. The Eesti Pank became one of the central banks of the Eurozone. The purpose of Eesti Pank is to help maintain price stability in the euro area. The uniform monetary policy of the euro area helps to keep prices stable.

Blackbirding

Blackbirding is a term to refer to tricking people to work on plantations, or farms for little or no pay. In the 19th century, it was mainly used to refer to people from the Pacific islands working in Australia, Peru, and Hawaii. The people were melanesians and micronesians. When hiring them, fraud, violence and deception were commonly used. In the 1930s, there were international protests that put an end to blackbirding. 

During the 19th, and early 20th century, people were taken from the many Pacific Islands. These blackbirded people were called Kanakas or South Sea Islanders. They were taken from places such as Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Niue, Easter Island, the Gilbert Islands, Tuvalu, Fiji, and the islands of the Bismarck Archipelago amongst others.

Examples of blackbirding outside the South Pacific include the early days of the pearling industry in Western Australia at Nickol Bay and Broome: Aboriginal Australians were blackbirded from the surrounding areas. Chinese men were blackbirded from Amoy in the 1840s and 50s to work as unskilled labourers in the pearling, gold and farming industries.

Practices similar to blackbirding continue to the present day. One example is the kidnapping and coercion, often at gunpoint, of indigenous peoples in Central America to work as plantation labourers in the region. They are subjected to poor living conditions, are exposed to heavy pesticide loads, and do hard labour for very little pay.

Especially the Royal Navy, and different missionary societies saw Blackbirding as a form of slave trade. Blackbirding included a whole system of treaties, where the peopel agreed to be what was called an indentured servant. Even today, people do not agree if this was a form of slavery. 

Shanghaiing

Shanghaiing is a term from nautical language: it refers to forcing a person to work on a ship, using trickery, intimidation or violence.

Raorchestes ponmudi

The karge Ponmudi bush frog ("Raorchestes ponmudi") is a frog. It lives in southern India. Scientists saw this frog on Ponmudi Hill in the Western Ghat mountains, about 1000 meters above sea level. The frogs were sitting on plants 8-15 meters off the ground, high in the trees where the branches touch. Most of the time, people see them in evergreen trees. Sometimes people see them on coffee plants.

The adult frog is 35.9-38.9 mm long from nose to rear end. Unlike other frog species, the male frogs of "R. pomudi" are larger than the female frogs. They are larger than all other frogs and toads where they live.

Each frog has two stripes from their eyes to their rear end. These stripes make an X on the back. There is a light brown between the eyes. The skin of the frog's belly is gray-yellow in color with some white and black. The back legs are light brown with gray marks. The iris of the eye is gold-bronw in color with a gray circle. There is some green color on the front legs.

Smithsonian American Art Museum

The Smithsonian American Art Museum (commonly known as SAAM, and formerly the National Museum of American Art) is a museum in Washington, D.C.. It is part of the Smithsonian Institution. 

The collection began in 1846. Congress declared that there should be "a gallery of art" as part of the Smithsonian Institution. By 1968 the collection was moved to the current location. It is in the building that was built in the early 1800s. It is called the Old Patent Office Building. SAAM is located in the same building as the National Portrait Gallery.

In 1972, the Renwick Gallery opened. It is a branch of SAAM that exhibits to design and crafts. It is in a historic building near the White House.

Raorchestes drutaahu

The fast-calling shrub frog ("Raorchestes drutaahu") is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists saw this frog in Kodaikanal in the Western Ghat mountains, between 1000 and 1450 meters above sea level.

People have seen this frog in special forests called shola forests and in the grassy places just outside the forests. They saw the frogs .5 to 1.4 meters above the ground. People have also see them in tea farms. Like other frogs in "Raorchestes", this frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog and never swims as a tadpoles.

Scientists think that humans cutting down the forests to make tea farms could be bad for this frog and that chemicals meant to kill pests could kill the frog.

Neritic zone

The neritic zone (or sublittoral zone) is the relatively shallow part of the ocean above the drop-off of the continental shelf, approximately in depth.

Fish measurement

Fish measurement is the measuring of individual fish and various parts of their anatomies (their body forms), for data used in many areas of ichthyology, including taxonomy and fishery biology.

Standard length (SL) is the length of a fish measured from the tip of the snout to the back end of the last vertebra or to the posterior end of the midlateral portion of the hypural plate. This measurement excludes the length of the caudal (tail) fin.

Total length (TL) is the length of a fish measured from the tip of the snout to the tip of the longer lobe of the end tail fin, usually measured with the lobes compressed along the midline. It is a straight-line measure, not measured over the curve of the body.

Standard length measurements are used with Teleostei (most bony fish), while total length measurements are used with Myxini (hagfish), Petromyzontiformes (lampreys) and usually Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays), as well as some other fishes.

Total length measurements are used in slot limit and minimum landing size regulations.

Fishery biologists often use a third measure in fishes with forked tails, called Fork length (FL), the length of a fish measured from the tip of the snout to the end of the middle caudal fin rays, and is used in fishes in which it is difficult to tell where the vertebral column ends.

Other possible measurements include the lengths of various fins, the lengths of fin bases and the diameter of the eye.

Abudefduf

Abudefduf, also known as the sergeant-majors, is a genus of fish in the family Pomacentridae.
The name is from Arabic "abu", "the one with"; and "def", "side", and the plural ending "-duf". The name thus means "the one with prominent sides".

The approximately 20 species of "Abudefduf" may be divided into planktivores (plankton eaters) and benthivores (shellfish eaters) and three broadly tropical living clades (groups). Two of the "Abudefduf" clades are primarily benthivorous and a third clade is composed of planktivores and is the most species-rich. Most diversification (dfferent classes) has occurred in the last 10 million years within this genus across all clades.

The following 21 species are recognized in the genus "Abudefduf":

Hawaiian sergeant major

The green damselfish (Abudefduf abdominalis), also known as the Hawaiian sergeant major, is a non-migratory (lives always in the same area) fish of the family Pomacentridae. It occurs in the Pacific Ocean in near the Hawaiian Islands, Midway Island and Johnston Atoll. It can grow to a maximum total length of 30 cm (11.8 inches).

Adults of the species are typically found in quiet waters with rocky bottoms in inshore and offshore reefs at a depth of 1 to 50 m (3 to 164 ft), although juveniles (young fish) may sometimes be found in surge pools. It is a benthopelagic species, with adults being known to form schools (large groups). The species feeds on a variety of algae and zooplankton and is oviparous, with distinct pairing occurring during breeding. Eggs of "Abudefduf abdominalis" are demersal (bottom feeders) and adhere to the ground ?(substrate), with males guarding and aerating (giving air) the eggs. The species is known to be used as a food source for humans in Hawaii. It occasionally appears in the aquarium trade.

Cheetah reintroduction in India

Over 70 years after the extinction of India's native Asiatic cheetah subspecies, a small number of Southeast African cheetahs have been introduced to India's Kuno National Park as an experiment permitted by the Supreme Court. The goal is to test their adaptation in the long term. India's Asiatic cheetahs, once widespread, gradually disappeared due to habitat loss, prey depletion, and hunting. Discussions on cheetah reintroduction in India began in the 1950s, and proposals were made to Iran and other countries. The current experiment involves importing African cheetahs to Kuno National Park, supervised by wildlife experts. The process has faced mixed scientific reactions, with some viewing it as a valuable effort and others raising concerns about challenges like habitat suitability, human population pressure, and conflicts with larger predators. The ongoing reintroduction attempt is closely monitored, with released cheetahs adapting to the wild while facing mortality risks due to various factors. The project seeks to address the loss of the iconic species from India's landscape and to contribute to global cheetah conservation.

Joseph Augustus Zarelli

Joseph Augustus Zarelli ( February 1957), previously known as "The Boy in the Box" while unidentified, was a American boy whose body was discovered in a cardboard box sometime in late February 1957 in a wooded area off the side of the Susquehanna Road in Fox Chase, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Zarelli appeared to have been cleaned and freshly groomed, with a recent haircut and trimmed fingernails, although however the boy suffered extensive child abuse before his death. He had multiple bruises, and was also severely malnourished, weighing just about 30 pounds when discovered. At the time of discovery, he was unidentified and therefore was called "The Boy in the Box". 
On 8 December 2022, the boy was positively identified as Joseph Augustus Zarelli, after remaining unidentified for 65 years, 9 months, and 13 days.
Forced prostitution

When people use threats or violence, to make other people to work as prostitutes, this is called forced prostitution. Forced prositution mostly affects women and children. It is a form of sexual abuse that often occurs together with human trafficking. Violence or force can be in different forms. Sometimes people simply profit from the fact that a person has no other option. Forced prostitution is illegal under customary law, in all countries. The Rome Statute is an international treaty, of 2002. It includes forced prostitution as a war crime, and a crime against humanity. 

Abudefduf bengalensis

Abudefduf bengalensis, known as the Bengal sergeant or the narrow-banded sergeant major, is a species of damselfish in the family Pomacentridae. It is a marine species native to the tropical Indo-Pacific. Its range is from the eastern Indian Ocean to Australia and Japan in the Pacific Ocean. It is not known to occur in the Red Sea.

High Efficiency Video Coding

High Efficiency Video Coding ,HEVC (H.265), also known as MPEG-H Part 2, is a video compression standard succeeding AVC (H.264). It offers 25-50% better compression or improved quality at the same bit rate. Supporting up to 8K resolution, HEVC employs diverse block sizes (4x4 to 32x32) with both integer DCT and DST. HEIF is based on HEVC.

HEVC builds upon H.264/MPEG-4 AVC concepts. Both analyze video frames for redundancies within and between frames. Redundant parts are replaced with concise descriptions. HEVC enhances this by expanding comparison areas up to 64x64 pixels, refining variable-block-size segmentation, enhancing "intra" prediction within frames, improving motion prediction and compensation, and adding sample-adaptive offset filtering. These improvements increase compression processing, but decompression is less affected.

HEVC was standardized by the Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC), a collaboration between ISO/IEC MPEG and ITU-T Study Group 16 VCEG. It's known as MPEG-H Part 2 by ISO/IEC and as H.265 by ITU-T. The first version was ratified in January 2013 and published in June 2013. The second version, including multiview, range, and scalability extensions, was approved in 2014 and published in 2015. 3D and screen content coding extensions followed in 2015 and 2017 respectively, catering to graphics-rich content. In 2017, HEVC received a Primetime Emmy Engineering Award for its significant impact on television technology.

HEVC was collaboratively developed by over a dozen global organizations. Key patent contributors were Samsung Electronics (4,249 patents), General Electric (1,127 patents), M&K Holdings (907 patents), NTT (878 patents), and JVC Kenwood (628 patents). Additional patent holders include Fujitsu, Apple, Canon, Columbia University, KAIST, Kwangwoon University, MIT, Sungkyunkwan University, Funai, Hikvision, KBS, KT, and NEC.

Slavery in the 21st century

Slavery still exists in the 21st century. It is usually called modern slavery or neo-slavery. The ways in which people are made slaves, or kept in slave-like conditions have changed. There no longer is a definition everyone agrees on. Estimates of the number of slaves today, range from around 38 million to 49.6 million, depending on the method used to form the estimate and the definition of slavery being used. Those in slavery are often difficult to identify, and difficult to count. 

The International Labour Organization estimates that, by their definitions, over 40 million people are in some form of slavery today. 24.9 million people are in forced labor, of whom 16 million people are exploited in the private sector such as domestic work, construction or agriculture, 4.8 million people in forced sexual exploitation, and 4 million people in forced labour imposed by state authorities. An additional 15.4 million people are in forced marriages.

Slavery has been officially abolished. Enslavement therefore no longer is about legal ownership. Modern slavery is about illegal control. In most cases, slaves are no longer bought or sold. Rather, "slavery" exists as a form of employment / labor. People become trapped in slavery-like conditions in various ways.

Modern slavery is often seen as a by-product of poverty.Slavery is most common in poor countries, and those with vulnerable minorities. It also exists in developed countries. Tens of thousands of people work in slave-like conditions in industries such as mining, farming or in factories. There they produce goods for their home market, or for export into more prosperous countries. 

In the older form of slavery, slave-owners spent more on buying or getting slaves. The cost of keeping the slave healthy was considered a better investment than getting another slave to replace them. In modern slavery people are easier to get at a lower price so replacing them when exploiters run into problems becomes easier. Slaves are then used in areas where they could easily be hidden while also creating a profit for the exploiter.

Modern slavery can be quite profitable, and corrupt governments silently allow it, despite its being outlawed by international treaties such as Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery and local laws. Total annual revenues of traffickers were estimated in 2014 to over $150 billion, though profits are substantially lower. American slaves in 1809 were sold for around the equivalent of US$40,000 in today's money. Today, a slave can be bought for $90–$100.

Bales explains, "This is an economic crime ... People do not enslave people to be mean to them; they do it to make a profit."

Currently the following forms are known:



Raorchestes dubois

The Koadaikanal bush frog ("Raorchestes dubois") is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists saw this frog in Kodaikanal in the Western Ghat mountains, about 1900-2300 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is about 19.2 mm to 20.8 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 25.1 mm to 25.3 mm long.

The skin of the frog's back is green in color with some silver and blue-purple. There is a mark in the shape of a V on the frog's back from the eyes to the rear end. The back and sides have black, brown, silver, and purple spots. The iris of the eye is gold-brown in color with some green and brown. The ends of the toes are white. The sides of the belly have yellow-brown marks.

Markov model

A Markov model is when things are predicted from other things that came immediately before. For example, if it usually snows after it rains, you might guess that it will snow tomorrow if it is raining today. A Markov model is part of probability theory. Mostly, it tries to predict "states" from previous states. Some Markov models include the Markov chain and the Markov decision process.

The Markov chain is a simple Markov model. It has "the Markov property," which means that future states of the variable are because of the previous states of the variable.

A hidden Markov model is a type of Markov chain. This is very similar to a basic Markov model, but when the state is only partially observable or noisily observable. In other words, past states are related to the state of the system, but they don't tell us enough to perfectly know the state we are trying to predict. This has used commonly. For example, it helps computers automatically turn speech audio into words.

A Markov decision process is a type of Markov chain. A Markov decision process goes from one state to another. It uses a vector to do this.

Markov chains are used to predict the future. They can predict prices and wind power.

Geir Frigard

Geir Frigård (born 3 November 1970) is a Norwegian former professional footballer who played as a forward. He played five times for the Norway national team, scoring one goal. In 1997–98, he was top scorer in the Austrian Bundesliga. He retired from playing in 2007.
Geir Frigård started his career at his hometown club Funnefoss/Vormsund. He played his first games as a professional for Lillestrøm SK. He could not establish himself there and was given to Kongsvinger IL after three seasons. His UEFA Cup performances for Kongsvinger IL were good so he returned to Lillestrøm SK in 1995. In 1997 he followed his coach Per Brogeland to Austria to LASK. In his first season he was top scorer in Austria with 23 goals. In his second season in Austria he managed to score ten goals in 20 games. His good performances fell into an economically difficult time of the LASK. So he moved to Germany for 1.5 million € to Tennis Borussia Berlin, where he was the most expensive purchase in history at the time. He returned to LASK in 2001. There he played a bigger role again. LASK was relegated that season. After one year and scoring 15 goals he moved to Lierse SK in Belgium, where he stayed until 2004. Lierse SK was also his last team abroad.

Denmark Vesey

Denmark Vesey (1767 – 1822) was an African-American slave. Today, he is known for planning one of the biggest slave uprisings in the United States. The plan was found out, and he was arrested. Together, with the other leaders of the rebellion, he was executed. Two slaves who did not agree with Vesey’s plans told the authorities. They charged 131 people of conspiring. 67 were convicted. 35 were hanged. One of those was Denmark Vesey.

Scissortail sergeant

The scissortail sergeant or striptailed damselfish ("Abudefduf sexfasciatus") is a large damselfish. It earns its name from the black-striped tail and sides, which are remind people of the insignia of a military Sergeant, being similar to those of the sergeant major damselfish. It grows to a length of about . Scissortail sergeants live on coral reefs at depths of up to in tropical reaches, often living in a group surrounding a single head of coral. They are found on reefs in the Indo-Pacific region, including the Red Sea. This fish is popular in the aquarium trade. It is very aggressive and difficult to stay peaceful with other similar size fishes.
The fish feed upon the larvae of invertebrates, zooplankton, smaller fishes, crustaceans, and various species of algae. They are preyed upon by some members of the Labridae and Serranidae families. They lay their eggs in patches on a firm substrate and guard them vigorously till they hatch.

This fish is white. They have 5 vertical bands that are black. Two horizontal bands are present on the sides of their tail. This fish can grow up to at maximum length.

Like some other fish species, male scissortail sergeants are in charge of parental care. Males are polygamous and will collect eggs from up to 12 females while females spawn with a male and then abandon their eggs. Male parental care is more common than female or biparental care in fish because territorial males are able to guard several clutches of eggs while at the same time attracting new mates.

Male scissortail sergeants undergo brood cycling, in which they switch between a mating phase and a parental phase. During the mating phase, males become gold in color and put on displays to attract egg-laying females. After two to three days in the mating phase, male scissortail sergeants will lose their gold color and transition into a four- to five-day parental phase. During the parental phase, males guard their eggs until they hatch. Filial cannibalism occurs during the parental phase.

In order to select the best quality males and maximize their offspring survival rate, females will pool their eggs with other females into a single male's territory and create a larger brood. Studies have shown that pooling to create larger broods serves to not only decrease predatory effects, but also increases paternal work on the eggs. Also, males with larger broods are less likely to cannibalize (eat) their broods. It has also been thought that egg pooling is a simple imitation tactic by which females confirm the quality of the male. By copying the spawning behavior of other females, females can minimize the search costs of finding a good mate.

Filial cannibalism, the act of eating one's own children, is common in territorial male fish. It occurs during the parental phase of brood cycling. Embryo mortality rates are generally attributed more to filial cannibalism than to other fish eating eggs because embryo predators are largely unsuccessful. Recent studies suggest that filial cannibalism, in fact, is an evolutionarily adaptive behavior. Baseline cannibalism is a result of males eating nonviable or damaged eggs, but males may cannibalize their current broods even more based on the costs and benefits of their parental investment. Raising offspring requires a large amount of energy



John Punch (slave)

John Punch ( 1630s, living 1640) was an enslaved African who lived in the colony of Virginia. Thought to have been an indentured servant, Punch attempted to escape to Maryland. In July 1640, the Virginia Governor's Council sentenced him to serve as a slave for the rest of his life. Two European men who ran away with him received a lighter sentence of extended indentured servitude. For this reason, some historians consider John Punch the "first official slave in the English colonies," and his case as the "first legal sanctioning of lifelong slavery in the Chesapeake." Some historians also consider this to be one of the first legal distinctions between Europeans and Africans made in the colony, and a key milestone in the development of the institution of slavery in the United States.

In July 2012, Ancestry.com published a paper suggesting that John Punch was a twelfth-generation grandfather of President Barack Obama on his mother's side, on the basis of historic and genealogical research and Y-DNA analysis. Punch's descendants were known by the Bunch or Bunche surname. Punch is also believed to be one of the paternal ancestors of the 20th-century American diplomat Ralph Bunche, the first African American to win the Nobel Peace Prize.

Spiny chromis

The spiny chromis ("Acanthochromis polyacanthus") is a species of damselfish from the western Pacific. It is the only member of the genus Acanthochromis.

This fish usually lives in coral reefs at a depth range of This fish eats only plankton although younger individuals have been known to eat mucus off the adults. Spiny chromis individuals can grow up to a maximum size of as adults.

The spiny chromis, unlike many other coral reef fishes, has direct development of their larvae. The parents protect their brood from the egg stage (laid on the reef), through hatching and onto the fully developed juvenile stage.

Staghorn damselfish

Amblyglyphidodon curacao; also known as the staghorn damselfish, the clouded damselfish or the bare-snouted sergeant major; is a species of marine fish in the family Pomacentridae, the damselfishes and the clownfishes. It's widespread throughout the tropical waters of the western Pacific Ocean. This species is a small sized fish that can reach a maximum size of 11 cm length.

Green chromis

Chromis viridis (green chromis) is a species of damselfish. Individuals tend to be iridescent apple-green and light blue, and reach a length of 10 cm. It is sometimes called the "blue-green chromis", but that may also refer to "Chromis caerulea", the blue puller, a close relative that is sometimes considered conspecific.

The species is found in the Indo-Pacific, including the Red Sea. It is found in tropical and subtropical waters. In the Indian Ocean, they are found in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, eastern Africa, Madagascar, Seychelles, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Maldives, Sri Lanka, the Andaman Sea, Australia, and Indonesia. In the Pacific Ocean, they are found in the Gulf of Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, China, Taiwan, Japan, the Great Barrier Reef, New Zealand, New Caledonia, Polynesia, Melanesia, and Hawaii in the Indo-Pacific part of the Pacific Ocean. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, they are found from the Gulf of California south to Peru and the Galapagos Islands. There are some reports of this species in the Mediterranean Sea. They live in coral reefs and lagoons. Individuals of this species are encountered in depths of .

Adults of this species can grow up to at maximum length. They have 12 dorsal rays, 9 to 11 soft dorsal rays, 2 anal spines, and 9 to 11 anal soft rays on their fins. It is a blue green fish. When they are breeding, males turn more yellowish.

Phytoplankton, zooplankton, and algae, copepods, "Artemia", and amphipods make up the diet of this fish in the wild. This fish also feeds on eggs that fail to hatch. It feeds by ram jawing.

"Chromis viridis" schools in aggregations around "Acropora" coral heads.

In a marine aquarium, schools are kept in small groups of odd numbers. The green Chromis is relatively inexpensive. A small school will be more comfortable in a minimum size of a tank but a single specimen can be kept in a . Some aquarists have successfully bred the blue green Chromis in the home aquarium.

The green chromis is not housed with larger predatory fish, as they may become food themselves. Groupers, lionfish, and eels all present an element of danger for this species.

"Chromis viridis" spawn over sand and small stones. The male prepares the nest which is shared with several females. The nest is located on sand or rubble. During spawning, the male turns more yellowish in color. The large number of eggs will hatch in 2–3 days. The male guards the nest and ventilates it with its fins and feeding on those eggs that do not hatch. Males feed on unhatched eggs to prevent them from being breeding grounds for microorganisms which risks their lives.


One Week

"One Week" is the first single off of Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies's fourth studio album "Stunt". The song was released on September 15, 1998.

The song was able to make it to #1 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, #1 on the Alternative Airplay, #1 on the Mainstream Top 40, #2 on the Adult Alternative Songs, and #2 on the Adult Top 40. Ironically, it stayed at #1 on the Hot 100 chart for one week. It was also certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).

The song is filled with pop culture references. In the song, it mentions the superhero Aquaman, the restaurant Swiss Chalet, the anime "Sailor Moon", the television show "The X-Files", the movies "Frantic", "Vertigo", and "Seven Samurai", actor Harrison Ford, director Akira Kurosawa, musicians Busta Rhymes, LeAnn Rimes, Bert Kaempfert, and Sting, the song "Scenario" by A Tribe Called Quest, and the chocolate bar Snickers.

Some people were wondering what the lyric "I’m the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral / Can’t understand what I mean? Well, you soon will" meant. Vocalist Ed Robertson said that when he was at the funeral of his older brother who died in a motorcycle accident, the pastor was quoting "Free Bird" by Lynyrd Skynyrd. Drummer Tyler Stewart whispered "SKYNARD!" to him and held up the devil horns which caused Robertson to laugh.

Chrysiptera hemicyanea

Chrysiptera hemicyanea, known commonly as the azure damselfish, azure demoiselle, half-blue demoiselle, and yellow-dipped damsel, is a species of damselfish.

The generic name, "Chrysiptera", is a compound of the Greek words "chrysos", meaning "golden" and "pteron" meaning "fin" or "wing", while the specific name, "hemicyanea", means "half blue" referring to the blue head and upper body.

It is native to the eastern Indian Ocean and western Pacific. It has also recently been filmed in the Mediterranean Sea off Malta.

Being a reef species, these fish are found in greatest population in what's known as the Coral triangle, which is one of the largest concentrations of coral reefs in the world, located form the Solomon Islands to Indonesia, Bali and the Philippines.

Typically found in waters 1 to 38m deep and are non migratory.

This tropical marine fish reaches in length. It is mostly bright blue in color, with a bright yellow bottom. Different species in this genus have varied amounts of gold coloring.

As a tropical species, these species are found in coral reefs near the equator. They inhabit (live in) lagoons or near shore reefs and are typically found in rock structures or around branching corals like "Acropora" corals. This species is a reef dependent species that needs corals or other structures for protection from predators. Primary eat plankton and small invertebrates.

The reproduction of "Chrysiptera hemicyanea" is not well studied. Reproduction in the genus "Chrysiptera" involves mating pairs, followed by a benthic egg-laying life cycle, where eggs are stuck to a substrate and a male stays around to guard and aerate the eggs. In addition this genus has a shorter larval stage when compared to other damselfish and because of these two things have issues distributing. Population has the ability to double in 15 months.

The primary way to protect this species is to maintain their primary living areas which is coral reefs. In current times coral reefs are beginning to disappear in most areas due to coral bleaching. Coral bleaching occurs when warmer average temperatures cause corals to begin to overheat and die, turning them white. Global warming is thought of as the primary cause reef destruction, and will only worsen in the coming decades. It is projected that by the middle of the century there will be severe damage to global coral reefs. As coral reefs die out it may become necessary to supplement structure like artificial reefs or any type of structure that fish has hide in.

This fish is a popular species in the home aquarium along with some closely related species like "Chrysiptera talboti"and "C. rollandi". In captivity they are quite hardy and easy to take care of. They can tolerate some minor changes in water chemistry and are recommended for beginners in the saltwater aquarium trade. This species will eat just about anything including fish flakes and frozen brine shrimp.

Even though they are considered a schooling fish, they are quite aggressive and territorial. Fish that invade the area are harassed, sometimes to death. The best way to avoid this is to place fish in a large enough tank with plenty of structure like coral or live rock.

Recently this species has been successfully bred in captivity to try and increase the supply to the aquarium trade and decrease the environmental impact.

Alikhan Bukeikhanov

Alikhan Nurmukhameduly Bukeikhanov (; 5 March 1866 – 27 September 1937), was a Kazakh politician. He was Prime Minister of Alash Autonomy from 1917 to 1920.

He died in 1937 from execution by firing squad.

Bukeikhanov was born on 5 March 1866, in Tokyrauyn Volost, Russian Empire. His father, Nurmuhammed Bukeikhanov and his great-grandfather, Barak Sultan, were a khan of the Orta zhuz. He was graduated from the Saint Petersburg Forestry Institute and Omsk Technical School, in 1890.

In 1905, Bukeikhanov got involved in politics by joining Constitutional Democratic party. He tried to start a Kazakh Democratic party in 1905, but failed and got arrested. He became part of a government group in 1906 and protested against the government's actions. He got arrested again in 1908 and was sent away until 1917.

A few months later, they made a new political party called the Alash Autonomy. In 1920, while the Soviet government established, Bukeikhanov joined the Bolshevik party.

In 1926, Bukeikhanov was arrested of working against the government and was put in the Butyrka prison in Moscow and released in 1930. He was arrested in 1937 and got executed by firing squad.

Crocodile Rock

"Crocodile Rock" is a 1972 song by Elton John and is the leading single to his sixth studio album "Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player".

Algae Lake

Algae Lake is a narrow lake that is 17 kilometers long and between 0.4 km to 1.9 km wide. It is east–west in the ice-free Bunger Hills of Antarctica. It was first mapped from air photos taken by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump, 1946 to 1947.

It was called "Algae Inlet" by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names because the algae changed colours. It extends to the meltwater ponds overlying the Bunger Hills and to the saline inlets and channels in the Highjump Archipelago. 

Later Soviet Antarctic Expeditions (1956–1957) found this "inlet" to be a lake and changed its name to Algae Lake instead of "Algae Inlet".

Garibaldi (fish)

The Garibaldi, known historically also as the Catalina goldfish and marine goldfish and now commonly as the Garibaldi damselfish (Hypsypops rubicundus) is a species of bright orange fish in the damselfish family. It is found in the subtropical northeastern part of the Pacific Ocean. The English name, Garibaldi, is based on an Italian surname and is a reference to the Italian general and political figure Giuseppe Garibaldi, whose followers often wore a characteristic scarlet or red shirt. As is the case in all damselfish, male Garibaldis aggressively defend the nest site after the female lays eggs.

Adult fish in this species are orange in color. It is the largest member of the damselfish family and can grow up to in length. Young ones are more reddish, and have many small iridescent (glowing, reflective) blue spots, which they lose as they become adult. Adult Garibaldis also have a more opaque tail and dorsal fin. The Garibaldi is the official marine state fish of California and is protected in Californian coastal waters.

Garibaldis are found in water from a depth of up to depth, usually near rock reefs, and typically over rocky sea-bottoms. This species is native to the north-eastern subtropical parts of the Pacific Ocean, ranging from Monterey Bay, California, to Guadalupe Island, Baja California.

Garibaldis feed mainly on invertebrates, which they remove from the rocks. Like most damselfish, adult Garibaldis maintain a home territory. The male clears a sheltered nest site within his territory; the female then deposits eggs within the nest. The male guards the nest area until the eggs hatch, which takes 19–21 days. During the time period that the eggs are developing, the male Garibaldi aggressively tries to keep all other fish away from the (very edible) eggs, and will boldly attack much larger swimming creatures, including humans, to the point of biting divers in order to try to drive them away from the area where the eggs are deposited.

It is peaceful during the juvenile period. But as long as the body is slightly larger, it will show territorial rights to other meek fish and compete with other small fish for territory.


Neoglyphidodon melas

Neoglyphidodon melas, also known as the bowtie damselfish, black damsel, bluefin or royal damsel, is a species of damselfish found in the Indo-West Pacific. It often makes its way into the aquarium trade. It grows to a size of in length.

The black damselfish is found throughout the Indo-Pacific in coral reefs and lagoons. In the Indian Ocean, they are found around the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, eastern Africa, Madagascar, Seychelles, the Arabian Sea, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, the Andaman Sea, Indonesia, and western Australia. In the Pacific Ocean, they are found in areas around Indonesia, Australia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Japan, Papua New Guinea, Palau, Vanuatu, and the Solomon Islands. they are found in depths of under sea level.

The adults of this species can grow up to in length. The colors of the adults are blueish black. Juveniles are mostly pale blue with a yellow dorsal surface. They have blue pelvic and anal fins with black interior rays.

Fish of this species are typically found alone or in pairs. Young ones are encountered around Acropora corals. Adults are found around clams of the genus Tridacna and sometimes feed on their waste.

"Neoglyphidodon melas" is an omnivorous (eat everything) species of damselfish which feeds on a variety of things. Younger juveniles feed only on plankton. Older juveniles of this species add soft corals to their diet. Young adults feed on Tridacna clam feces, with feces consumption increasing with age and size.

Adults are territorial towards one another and will defend territorial borders. Large adults are observed to be aggressive to smaller individuals. The larger the individual, the more aggressive it gets. They are also known to attack larger fish than themselves.

This species of fish is often found in the aquarium hobby. In the aquarium, this fish species can grow to a maximum size of . The average lifespan of this species in captivity is 2 to 3 years. As for most marine species, it is kept in a pH of 8.1 to 8.4, and a water hardness of 6° to 10°. Most people will keep this fish alone.

Adults pair up when they are breeding. The eggs are laid in the substrate. Once the eggs are laid, the male guards and aerates the eggs until they hatch.

Maroon clownfish

Premnas biaculeatus, commonly known as spine-cheeked anemonefish or the maroon clownfish, is a species of anemonefish (found swimming near anemones) found in the Indo-Pacific from western Indonesia to Taiwan and the Great Barrier Reef. They can grow up to be about . Like all anemonefishes it forms a symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones and is unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone. The female is largest, the breeding male is second largest, and the male nonbreeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends.They exhibit protandry, meaning the breeding male changes to female if the sole breeding female dies, with the largest nonbreeder becoming the breeding male. The fish's natural diet includes algae and zooplankton.


Microspathodon chrysurus

The yellowtail damselfish ("Microspathodon chrysurus") is a species of damselfish native to tropical areas such as the Caribbean coast of Panama. Damselfish are plentiful in coral reef environments. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists this fish as being of “least concern”. The species is exploited on a minor scale, for fisheries and the aquarium trade. It may be threatened by the invasive lionfish.

Adult and young adult damselfish differ significantly in terms of body color. The difference was so noticeable that researchers believed the adult and young adult forms were two distinct species. Adults are brown with a yellow caudal fin. Young adults are violet with blue spots in their back and transparent caudal fins.

The spawning (laying eggs) cycle of the yellowtail damselfish starts at sunrise and lasts approximately 1 hour after male damselfish have prepared nests on dead coral surfaces. Their eggs are demersal, sticking to the coral where males guard and fan oxygen over them. Hatching occurs the morning of the 6th day of incubation. Reproductive activity is highest during the lunar period between full and new moon. At those points in the lunar cycle, the pull of the sun and the moon are very high resulting in spring tides.

Kermadec scalyfin

The Kermadec scalyfin, "Parma kermadecensis", is a damselfish of the genus "Parma", found around New Zealand's Kermadec Islands around depths of between 3 and 20 m, over shallow rocky reef areas. Its maximum length recorded is 22 centimeters.

New Zealand women's national football team

The New Zealand women's national football team, which FIFA calls Aotearoa New Zealand and is looked after by New Zealand Football (NZF). The New Zealand national team has played in the FIFA Women's World Cup six times. They first played in the world cup for the first time in 1991. In 2023, New Zealand and Australia together hosted the World Cup. However, they have never gone further than the group stage in any of the tournaments.

In 1975, the New Zealand Women's Soccer Association was started. They were asked to join the Asian Women's Championship that year and they won. After that, they played in the Oceanic Championship.

When Australia left the OFC, New Zealand didn't have strong competitors in Oceania. This made it easier for New Zealand to qualify for the World Cup and Olympics. They've been in every edition of both tournaments since 2007.

In 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, New Zealand co-hosted the FIFA Women's World Cup with Australia. They were given the opportunity on 25 June 2020 because they were more likely to win than the other candidate, Colombia. The Football Ferns got to be in the tournament automatically as co-hosts. They won their first match against Norway, but surprisingly lost to newcomers Philippines. Later, they tied with Switzerland in their final match and were knocked out. This was the first time the hosts were knocked out in the group stage. They only managed to score one goal during the tournament.

Franz Jelinek

In the following season, his last for the Wiener Sport-Club, he was top scorer with 20 league goals together with Ernst Reitermaier.

The performances he had shown up to that point – and also those of Ludwig Durek, who was a year older than him and played on the left wing – did not go unnoticed by Reich coach Sepp Herberger. Both made their debuts on 15 September 1940 in the senior national team, which won the friendly against the national team of Slovakia 1-0 in Bratislava thanks to Durek's goal scored in the 81st minute. 
Despite being invited to another course in March 1941, he did not make international appearances. Durek earned five more international appearances and scored another goal.

Jelinek, drafted into service in the Wehrmacht, died as a soldier on 20 May 1944 after the Battle of Monte Cassino.

Stegastes nigricans

Stegastes nigricans, the dusky farmerfish, is a species of damselfish found around coral reefs at a depth of one to 12 meters, in tropical climates between 30°S and 30°N. They are known for farming monocultures of algae such as cyanophores and rhodophytes. It has an average length of 9.0 cm, but can reach lengths of 14.0 cm. It has 12 dorsal spines, and 15 to 17 dorsal soft rays. It also has 2 anal spines and 12 to 14 anal soft rays. Adults are generally brown, with the dorsal parts of the head and nape being darker, grading to tan on the lower parts of the head and breast. The scales have darker brown margins. The lips are whitish, the suborbital is mostly blue, and the preopercle and opercle scales have blue centers. The median and pelvic fins are brown, the pectorals are dusky, and sometimes there's a well-defined dark brown or blackish spot at the base of the posteriormost dorsal rays, which distinguishes it from the "S. lividus", where the spot is diffuse. When males are in courtship or guarding their eggs they have a broad white bar across the middle of the body and a pale blue stripe from the mouth to the upper part of the pectoral fin.

"S. nigricans" are found naturally in and around coral reefs. Adult "S. nigricans" live in reef flats and lagoon reefs in colonies in areas with staghorn coral. "S. nigricans" are limited by water temperature and their diet and have been experiencing a negative impact of their population amounts. Climate and ocean composition has been changing due to global warming and fossil fuel use, therefore this habitat is being altered and coral reefs are becoming greatly reduced.

"S. nigricans" is most frequently found across the coast of East Africa and around Madagascar; in the British Indian Ocean Territory and the southern coasts of India; across Southeast Asia, the northern coast of Australia; and Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia. They can also be found less frequently in the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of California, and across the Western coast of Central America.

Adults inhabit reef flats and lagoon reefs. They often occur in groups associated with live or dead branching staghorn coral ("Acropora"). They feed on algae, gastropods, sponges and copepods. They are territorial, and they maintain and "weed" filamentous algae patches growing on dead coral. They attack human intruders without hesitation, sometimes taking painful nips.

"S. nigricans" are oviparous and follow a breeding pair relationship between males and females. Their eggs are sticky and adhere to the coral. Males guard and tend to the egg nest via waving air over them and will be visited by several females throughout their time there. They're particularly aggressive during reproductive periods. During aggressive encounters, they emit clicking noises. Males guard and tend the nest, visited by several females.

Threespot dascyllus

The threespot dascyllus ("Dascyllus trimaculatus"), also known as the domino damsel or simply domino, is a species of damselfish from the family Pomacentridae. It is native to the Indo-Pacific from the Red Sea and East Africa, to the Pitcairn Islands, southern Japan, and Australia, and can also be found in some parts of the Philippines. Its grey to black body has two lateral white spots and one between the eyes like domino hence the name; the threespot dascyllus grows up to 13 cm in length. Coloration is somewhat changing; the spot on the forehead may be gone and the side spots very much smaller. It feeds on algae, copepods and other planktonic crustaceans.

Generally, adults are found in small groups around coral heads or large rocks. Juveniles may be found associated with large sea anemones or sheltering between the spines of diadema sea urchins or branching corals. This species may be found to depths of 55 m.

"Trimaculatus", meaning "three-spotted", refers to the fish's three white spots. This accounts also for the common name "domino".

During the juvenile period, they live with the sea anemone. They grow fast and can grow up to 14 cm in length in a large fish tank. People who like big fish may raise a pair of small Threespot to observe their growth.

Stegastes variabilis

Stegastes variabilis, commonly known as the Brazilian cocoa damselfish, is a species of damselfish in the family Pomacentridae. They live on coral reefs in the western Atlantic Ocean and off the coast of Brazil. They normally do not live with other fish.

The genus name is Greek for "stegastos." It means covered. In the past, the Caribbean cocoa damselfish was believed to be in the same species as the Brazilian cocoa damselfish, This is not true, the population from the Caribbean is genetically different.

The Brazilian cocoa damselfish is in the shape of an oval that is pressed in at the sides. It grows to about long. The top of the head and the snout have many blue stripes. The top of the body is generally dark brown, blue or brown. It has shades to yellow on the lower body. The sides have bars of vertical dark lines. They have two small black spots on their bodies. One is above the pectoral fins. The other on the top of the caudal peduncle. The large dorsal fin has twelve spines and between fourteen and seventeen soft rays. The anal fin has two spines and between twelve and fifteen soft rays. The caudal fin is forked and has rounded lobes.

Brazilian cocoa damselfish are found near Brazil in the western Atlantic Ocean. They do not migrate. These fish have a depth range of . 

Adults mainly eat benthic algae. They also eat sponges, ascidiacea and anemones. The young of the species eat invertebrates such as harpacticoid copepods and nemerteans. 

In the breeding season, the female lays eggs on the seabed. The eggs attached to empty shells, stones or other objects. They are then fertilized by the male. He then guards them, aerates them and chases away intruders. The fish are aggressive when they are breeding. There is also a distinct pairing during the breeding.

David Koker

David Koker ( – ) was a Jewish student who lived with his family in Amsterdam, until they were captured at nighttime in February 1943, and transported to Camp Vught.

David Koker was the child of Jesaia Koker and Judith Koker. He had a brother named Max. David was forced to drop out of university in September 1941, when the university forbidded Jews from studying there. His family recieved an exemption, thinking they were safe, and therefore they did not consider hiding from the Germans. Despite that, they were arrested and transported to Camp Vught in February 1943. David educated children there. In July 1943, David was temporarily saved from deportation by Frits Phillips, and joined his army. In June 1944, all of Phillips' army were deported to the Birkenau camp. From there, they would be deported to other camps to work for electronic companies.

David's mother Judith and brother Max survived World War II. 
Unfortunately, David died in February 1945 in Germany, during a transfer of ill people to the Dachau camp. His father too died of exhaustion in Groß-Rosen. 

David published "Modern-Hebreeuwze poëzie" in 1941. The 87-paged small book, was a bilingual edition of modern Hebrew poetry, with translations in Dutch. Melkamn, a pseudonym of Jozeph Michman, who was born in 1914 and who died in 2009, helped David to translate the book. It was published by Joachimsthal in Amsterdam.

During his internment, David wrote a diary which was smuggled out of the prison. He wrote pieces at a time. The diary is considered complete. The first entry is written on 11 February 1943, and the last on 8 February 1944. In addition to writing about his day-to-day life, David also wrote poetry. 

On 2 June 1944, whilst the family were being deported to Birkenau, David managed throw a letter from a train. Only a part of the letter is readable. 

This is what the readable part of the letter read:

Nederlands: "Lieve vrinden, we zijn nu dicht bij de grens. [Terwijl] het is wel teleurstellend, maar we waren erop voorbereid en zijn vol vertrouwen. Ik deen veel aan jullie." [Onleesbaar deel]. "Ik helb alle brieven en foto's bij me. Mn liefste bezit. Wanneer zien we elkaar weer? Dat zal nu wel lang duren. Maar eerdoor komen we." [Onleesbaar deel]. "Heel veel liefs jongens, bedankt vour alles. Tot ziens." 

English: "Dear friends, we are close to the border now. [While] it is very disappointing, but we are prepared for it and remain hopeful. I think a lot about you." [Unreadable part]. "I've got all your letters and photographs with me. My dearest possessions. When will we see each other again? That will take a long time. But we shall survive." [Unreadable part]." Lots of love guys, thanks for everything. Goodbye."

The diary was first published in 1977, with the name "Dagboek geschreven in Vught" (Diary written in Vught). The editor was Karel van het Reve, Koker's best friend, a professor of Slavic languages and literature. Karel collected and edited the smuggled diary fragments. The manuscript was stored at the Dutch Institute for War Documentation (NIOD). It had been translated to English and was published in 2012, under the title: "At the Edge of the Abyss: A Concentration Camp Diary, 1943-1944." Koker's diary was in finalist for the Jewish Book Award in the Holocaust category in 2012.
Raorchestes anili

Anil's bush frog ("Raorchestes anili") is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists saw it in the Western Ghat mountains between 840 and 1150 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is 23.2 - 25.2 mm long from nose to rear end and one female frog was 29.3 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is light brown in color with darker brown marks. There is a dark brown mark on each side of the body, from each front leg to each back leg, meeting in the middle to make a V shape. There is a light brown mark between the eyes. Most of the snout is gray. There are many brown-black spots on the back. The iris of the eye is yellow-red in color with gray around the outside.

Scientists named this frog after their helper, Anil Zachariah.

People have seen this frog in forests, in coffee farms, and even very near houses. This frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog. It never swims as a tadpole.

Scientists believe this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place and because it is good at living in places that human beings have changed.

Guosa

Guosa is a constructed language. It was created by Alex Igbineweka in 1965. It was designed to be a combination of the indigenous languages of Nigeria and to serve as a lingua franca to West Africa.

Though Guosa draws its vocabulary from at least 118 native West African languages, it gets most of its vocabulary from Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo, either taken directly or made from a combination of words from these languages. English also provides many of the more technical terms, either directly or through one of the African languages said before. Also, some words were produced a priori via sound symbolism, e.g. meeh "sheep", yanmu-yanmu "mosquito", and wuam "eat".

The different parts of speech came from particular languages. Most nouns come from Hausa, while verbs and abstracts come from Igbo or Yoruba. Also, words from all three source languages are often joined together to create a word that looks like all three. For example, the Guosa word méni "what" comes from Hausa "menini", Igbo "gini", and Yoruba "kini", all meaning "what".

Part Six

Part Six is a German boy band formed in 2006. It sings US5 genre music. The band is popular with songs like "Want Ya", "Drive so Far" & "Showtime".

The group was founded in the summer of 2006 by Matt Mockridge and Tim Niesel, later joined by Bastian Theurich, Marc Jentzen and Lemar Ali. Jessie (Jesse D'Lane) was selected by casting from over 3000 applicants. The casting was promoted by the magazine Yam! accompanied.

Part Six became known in September 2006 with their single "Want Ya!", a cover version of the Swedish "Pop-Idol" runner-up Darin, which went straight into the top 50 of the German singles charts and became the official title song of the 2006 YOU fair . The second single "Drive so Far" followed in December and Part Six toured Germany and Austria as a special guest on LaFee's "Das-Erste-Mal" tour. The formation had previously played a two-month tour of German and Austrian schools, shopping centers and cinemas.

The band was promoted through youth magazines such as Bravo, Yam!, Starflash , The Dome Magazine and Popcorn . Part Six has also appeared in numerous television shows, including KI.KA LIVE, VIVA Live!, Toggo TV, The Dome, Tigerenten Club, Pokito TV and the ZDF television garden.

At the beginning of March 2007, the record company EMI Germany decided not to renew the record contract for economic reasons. The financially extremely high investment in the project was not sustainable in the long term without international success, as the desired sales figures did not materialize.

As a result, Part Six changed the members in half. From 2009 more songs were produced and a second album was prepared. The band was seen in a new formation with the Michael Jackson cover "Wanna Be Starting Somethin'" at the Jetix Kids Awards, among other places , and other performances followed. Another founding member, Jesse D'Lane, left the group in 2009, leaving only two singers from the original line-up. The now five-piece band concentrated not only on the German market but also on the Polish market and also shot the next single video in Warsaw. The single "The Love Is Over" followed in early 2010 and the promotion for a second album release followed.

In July 2010, Kenny Walter joined the band. In August 2010, Chris Wieber left the group for health reasons and Jeremy Williams left the group for undisclosed reasons. Part Six then announced that they wanted to look for a new, fifth band member under the new name "Unique 5" in their own talent show in Austria, but this was never realised. Finally, in September 2010, the last four band members performed live at the Magnifest in Braunschweig.

At the end of May 2011, the band announced their dissolution.

At the end of 2011, Orry Jackson took part in the casting show "The Voice of Germany". After receiving several requests from house projects and DJs, he began a solo career.

The following genera are broken into the subfamily Chrominae:


The genus "Pycnochromis", which is not mentioned in the 5th edition of "Fishes of the World", has been regarded as a junior synonym of "Chromis" but is now recognised as a valid genus by some authorities. In addition, the genera "Acanthochromis" and "Altrichthys" which the 5th edition of Fishes of the World included in this subfamily have been reclassified as belonging to the Pomacentrinae.

Fusilier damselfish

The fusilier damselfish (Lepidozygus tapeinosoma) is a species of damselfish in the family Pomacentridae. It found in the Indo-Pacific oceans. They are popular in aquaria. Adults can grow up to a length of up to . 

It is the only species in the genus, "Lepidozygus", in its own subfamily, the Lepidozyginae.

They are found in the Indo-Pacific. It is found at depths of . This fish is found in coral reefs and lagoons. They live in tropical waters.

Adults can grow up to at maximum length. Color of this fish can change a lot. It depends on its behavior. When it feeds, it turns silvery green. It darkens when resting. In the Maldives, adults guarding their eggs have a banded pattern.

This fish is sometimes found in the aquarium trade. They can be kept in groups, and they are very peaceful. The Fussiler damselfish will flash red and green colors when feeding.

Pomacentrinae

Pomacentrinae is one of four subfamilies in the family Pomacentridae which includes the clownfishes and the damselfishes. It is the most diverse of the subfamilies in the Pomacentridae with around 21 genera and approximately 200 species.

The species within the Pomacentrinae have orb-like to partly long bodies and they do not have spiny caudal rays projecting out of the caudal peduncle. The majority of species asre territorial and they defend their feeding territory from members of their own species and other species which compete with them for food. They feed on algae, which they appear to farm, actively increasing the algal productivity within their territories. Many species lay demersal eggs, which are guarded and fanned by the male. One species, the freshwater demoiselle "Neopomacentrus taeniurus" is known to enter rivers and even reaches into the lowest stretches of streams.

The 5th Edition of "Fishes of the World" states that the Pomacentrinae is most likely to be paraphyletic but does not break the subfamily into different lineages. Other authorities split the Pomacentrinae into the subfamilies Abudefdufinae and Stegastinae and include the Amphiprioninae, the clownfishes as the tribe Amphiprionini within the Pomacentrinae.

The following genera are classified in the subfamily Pomacentrinae:

Canary damsels live in rocky areas, where they lay eggs that are defended by males. The young can be found along the coast, especially in tide pools.

The Canary damsel is sometimes harvested for use in saltwater aquaria on a very small scale. Its total population size is unknown and it faces no known threats from humans. It is also found in many marine protected regions. This fact, together with a non-fragmented range, and no evidence of population decline, has led the IUCN to classify the Canary damsel as "Least Concern."

The song is about body image and positivity. About the song, Cara said "It's just a song about these things that certain women go through on a daily basis in order to feel loved or in order to love themselves. I think that's such a thing that goes on in today's world. These weird things are instilled in us. You know? They tell us that we’re not good enough or that there's only one kind of beauty. This song basically is contradicting that idea. It's saying, 'Well, if the world doesn't like how you look then they should change. They should change their perspective. You don’t have to change yourself.'" She also said that it was "Basically about embracing yourself and finally coming to that conclusion where you feel love and you can love yourself."

A music video for the song was released. In the video, Cara sings in an abandoned warehouse room. Different people then introduce themselves. Throughout the video, the people talk about their scars and body image issues. American singer JoJo also makes an appearance.

Cariye

Cariye was the name given to enslaved women concubines in the Islamic world of the Middle East. They were especially known from the Ottoman Empire, where this title existed until the mid-19th century.

In general, a carie was a woman enslaved during warfare. In Islamic law, the enslavement of a woman was the only case where concubinage was permitted.

Such a woman had to obey her male owner, as she would have to obey her husband. The children, the caryie had with her master were born legally free. Because she was the mother of his children, her master could no longer sell her and she would be freed after his death.

The system existed in the Ottoman Empire far into the 19th century and is most famous within the Ottoman Imperial Harem of the Ottoman court. It has often been translated to mean "lady-in-waiting".

The Ottoman system formally followed the original Islamic law, but varied from it in practice. After the Ottoman Empire had conquered most of the Middle East, and after the borders to Christian Europe had come to a standstill, there was in practice few opportunities to capture women through warfare.

Because of the general ban for enslavement of Muslims, the non-Muslim was instead provided to the Ottoman slave market from Christian Europe through the Crimean slave trade and the Barbary slave trade. Being from non-Muslim countries, with whom the Ottoman Empire could be regarded to be in passive warfare, this was regarded equivalent to enslaved prisoners of war, and thus was perceived to be in accordance with Islamic law.

When the Crimean slave trade was closed after the Russian conquest of the Crimea in 1783 (and the Barbary slave trade in the early 19th-century), the slave trade underwent yet another transformation. From this point on, a majority of the were Circassians from Caucasus, with a minor part coming from the white slave trade. While the Circassians were normally Muslim, the ban against the enslavement of Muslims was overlooked in their case, and their original Muslim status was an "open secret".

The was always regarded as sexually available for the master of the house, and if she bore a child by him, she could no longer be sold. It was common for a to be freed (manumitted). However, a manumission did not mean that a was free to simply leave the household. In a Muslim society based on gender segregation, were women lived in seclusion, it was not a possibility for a manumitted woman to simply leave the house and walk about in the street, as a free unmarried woman without family would have no way to support herself. Instead, the manumission of a woman normally meant that a marriage was arranged for her; often, a male who freed a woman married her himself, or arranged for her to be married to another man.

There was a difference between women bought to be domestic servants of Muslim women, and women bought by men; the slave women who were formally the property of a Muslim woman, although legally available for the master of the house, could also be sold by her female owner.

In the first half of the 19th century, slavery had come to be regarded as morally wrong in the Western world. The liberal Sultan Abdulmejid I, who was affected by these views, included anti-slavery laws among his Westernized reforms, and formally banned the slavery system. This was, however, a formal ban, and in reality, the continued informally until the end of the 19th century.

This was a time when the working class was looking for fair treatment. 

Syndicalism found support not only in France but also in countries like Italy, Spain, and the United States, where workers were also fighting for their rights. It brought together trade unions, which became the driving force behind the movement, and advocated for worker control and self-management. Syndicalism represented a radical departure from traditional labor movements. It emphasized direct action and the overthrow of existing capitalist systems that exploited workers. It sought to create a society where workers held the power and decisions were made collectively within their unions, envisioning a more equitable and just future for the working class.

Since 1990, most of the coups in sub-Saharan Africa happened in countries that used to be ruled by France. Some people think that French influence might be causing instability in Africa.

The military leaders in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger stopped letting French troops operate in their countries. They also stopped using French as an official language.

There was supposed to be French troops in Niger after they left Mali and Burkina Faso. But because of a crisis in Niger and problems with France, this didn't happen.

A group called ECOWAS tried to change the bad image of this region, but they couldn't. They suspended Mali and Guinea after coups happened in those countries.

The coups in these countries are often similar. They usually happen because the military is unhappy with how the government is dealing with problems like protests or Islamic groups. The new leaders also don't have good relationships with Western countries. Instead, they look for support from Russia, Turkey, or other places.

Al-Kamil

Al-Kamil (Arabic: الكامل) (full name: al-Malik al-Kamil Naser ad-Din Abu al-Ma'ali Muhammad) (c. 1177 – 6 March 1238) was a leader from a place called Kurdistan, and he followed the Muslim religion. He was in charge of a country called Egypt and was the fourth ruler from a group known as the Ayyubids. This group was important in the history of the area.

When he was in charge, there was a big fight called the Fifth Crusade. The Ayyubids, the group he led, were able to win this fight against people from Europe called crusaders. The European crusaders called him "Meledin."

Later on, there was another fight, the Sixth Crusade. During this time, he gave control of a city called West Jerusalem to the Christian people. He even met a famous religious person named Saint Francis.

Al-Kamil was known for these important events in history.

Sultan of Egypt

The Sultan of Egypt was a title given to the leaders of Egypt after the Ayyubid dynasty of Saladin began ruling in 1174. This continued until Egypt was taken over by the Ottomans in 1517. 

The extent of the Egyptian Sultan's power changed over time, but it usually included areas like Sham and Hejaz. Because of this, the Ayyubid and later Mamluk sultans were also seen as the rulers of Syria. From 1914, the title was used again by the leaders of the Muhammad Ali dynasty of Egypt and Sudan. Later, in 1922, it was changed to the title of King of Egypt and Sudan.

Before Saladin became powerful, Egypt was the main place for the Shia Fatimid Caliphate. This was the only time in Islamic history when the Shia branch of Islam ruled a caliphate. The Fatimids had wanted to replace the Sunni Abbasid Caliphate in Iraq for a long time. Like the Abbasid group, they also called themselves Caliphs. This showed they thought they were at the highest level in Islam.

But when Saladin became strong in 1169, Egypt changed back to being Sunni and following the Abbasid Caliphate. Saladin saw the Abbasid Caliph as his leader in theory. In 1174, Saladin became a Sultan instead of a Caliph. From this time until the Ottoman takeover, the highest power in the caliphate was with the Sultan of Egypt.

Ethnicity in Australia

The people of Australia have diverse ethnic origins. The territory of what today is Australia was first inhabited by numerous indigenous peoples. The first European settlers came during the period of British colonization, beginning in the 16th century. Following independence from United Kingdom in the 20th century, numerous migration waves took place, most of these migrants came from Europe and Asia, small of them also came from Africa.

The largest ancestral groups in Australia are English Australians, Irish Australians, Scottish Australians, Chinese Australians, Italian Australians, German Australians, Indian Australians, Aboriginal Australians, Greek Australians, Filipino Australians, Dutch Australians, Vietnamese Australians, Lebanese Australians and various others.

Although the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) does not collect data on race or ethnicity, each census asks Australian residents to indicate up to two ancestries, and these ancestry responses are categorised into broad standardised ancestry groups. Immigration minister Andrew Giles has promised to include a question on ethnicity in the 2026 Australian census.

At the 2021 census, the ancestry responses categorised within European ancestral groups as a proportion of the total population amounted 57.2% (46% North-West European and 11.2% Southern and Eastern European), Asian ancestral groups amounted 17.4% (6.5% Southern and Central Asian, 6.4% North-East Asian and 4.5% South-East Asian), North African and Middle Eastern groups amounted 3.2%, Peoples of the Americas amounted 1.4% and Sub-Saharan African groups amounted 1.3%. Also at the 2021 census, 3.2% of the Australian population identified as being Indigenous — Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders. The Northern Territory has the highest proportion of Indigenous Australians, with 26.3% of the population identifying as beign Indigenous.

The proportion of ancestry responses categorised within Oceanian ancestry groups is 33.8% of the total population, although of which 29.9% are within the "Australian" ancestry group, which most of them are at least partial to be of Anglo-Celtic or other European ancestry. Regardless of the census, the population of European descent was estimated at 72% or 76%.

Chorleywood bread process

The Chorleywood bread process was invented at the British Baking Industries Research Association at Chorleywood in 1961. Compared to traditional bread-making processes, it uses more yeast, added fats, chemicals, and high-speed mixing to allow the dough to be made with lower-protein wheat. The bread is made in a shorter time. In 2009, 80% of bread made in the United Kingdom was made this way. 

It uses dough conditioners. These are usually oxidizing agents such ascorbic acid or potassium bromate.The high-speed mixing process takes less than 5 minutes. The mixer operates at hundreds of revolutions per minute.

It has been criticised as producing unhealthy ultra-processed food.

Chorleywood

Chorleywood is a village and a civil parish in the Three Rivers District, Hertfordshire. It used to be part of the parish of Rickmansworth. 11,286 people lived there at the 2011 census.

Ahmet's father and three of his brothers fought with Colonel Yakovlev, and as a punishment, they were sent to Siberia for 15 years.

Ultra-processed food

Ultra processed food is a classification in the NOVA food classification system. This system was developed by the Brazilian nutrition researcher Carlos Monteiro, with his team at the Center for Epidemiological Research in Nutrition and Health at the University of São Paulo, Brazil. The system looks at food processing not foods types or nutrients -- which are used in most other food categorization systems. NOVA sorts foods into four categories:


Almost all food is processed in some way. The term ultra-processing refers to the processing of industrial ingredients derived from foods, for example by extruding, moulding, re-shaping, hydrogenation, and hydrolysis. Ultra-processed foods generally include additives like preservatives, sweeteners, sensory enhancers, colourants, flavours, and processing aids. Infant formula and medical food are also considered ultra-processed. Food additives are not always a marker of ultra-processed foods. Preservatives, for example antioxidant or nitrite, are permitted for category 3.

This classification system is not accepted by everyone.

“Chorleywood” process bread, ready meals, reconstituted meat and almost all breakfast cereals are generally thought to be ultra-processed. 

Ultra-processed food is generally cheap, so poor people eat a lot of it. 

There is evidence that eating a lot of it increases the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes and cancer.

Evil Queen

The Evil Queen (also known as the Wicked Queen, Queen Grimhilde, Queen Ingrid, the witch or the hag) is a fictional character who is the antagonist of the fairy tale "Snow White" (written by the Brothers Grimm) and its many variations.

The exact personality of the Evil Queen is different depending on which version of the story is being told but one thing always remains the same: she is obsessed with beauty. 

In the story, she is the stepmother of Snow White. In some versions, she married Snow White's father (the King) so that she could become Queen and kill him. The Evil Queen is jealous of Snow White because she is told that the princess is more beautiful than her.

The Evil Queen owns a magic mirror, which one day informs her that her young stepdaughter Princess Snow White has surpassed her in beauty. The Queen orders her Huntsman to take the princess into the forest and murder her. However, the Huntsman takes pity on Snow White, and instead, brings the Queen the lungs and liver of a wild boar. The Queen has the cook prepare the lungs and liver and she eats what she believes are Snow White's organs.

While questioning her mirror again, the Queen discovers that Snow White is still alive. Intending to kill Snow White herself, she takes the disguise of an old hag. She sells Snow White laces for a corset that she laces too tight in an attempt to suffocate the girl. When that fails, the Queen returns as a comb seller and tricks Snow White into using a poisoned comb. When the comb, too, fails to kill Snow White, the Queen again visits Snow White disguised as a farmer's wife and gives Snow White a poisoned apple. She eats the poisoned apple and falls into a deep sleep.

Snow White is awakened by the Prince from another kingdom, and they invite the Queen to their wedding. There, she is forced to put on red-hot iron shoes and "dance" until she dies. 

In some versions of the story, the Evil Queen's death varies depending on the story. In more modern times, the Evil Queen no longer dies due to dancing in red-hot iron shoes. Some versions say she died from anger after finding out Snow White survived the apple while others have Snow White forgive the Queen. 

The Evil Queen appears in many variations of the story but her most famous appearance is in "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", a Disney movie. 

Here, her character remains largely the same except she is specified to also be a witch. In the Disney movie, the Evil Queen transforms into a hag using magic and travels to give Snow White a poisoned apple, which she eats and dies. The Evil Queen is then chased by the Seven Dwarfs and falls off a cliff.

In the 2024 remake, she will be portrayed by Gal Gadot.

1867 Manhattan, Kansas earthquake

On 24 April 1867, a big earthquake hit Riley County, Kansas, in the United States. The maximum Mercalli intensity was VII (Very strong), and a magnitude of 5.1 was given. It caused minor damage in Kansas, Iowa, and Missouri, according to the United States Geological Survey. It was felt across a area of , even reaching Indiana, Illinois, and possibly Ohio. It was one of the biggest earthquakes in the history of Kansas.

Manhattan is close to the Nemaha Ridge, which is a long, folded rock structure with some surrounding faults. In 2016, a hazard map by the United States Geological Survey predicted a very low (1% or less) chance of a big earthquake happening in Kansas in the next year.

An earthquake happened in Manhattan, Kansas, close to the Kansas River and the Big Blue River. This area is close to the Nemaha Ridge, which is an old granite range with faults that likely caused the earthquake. The area also has the Humboldt Fault Zone, which acts as the eastern boundary of the range and is a important source of earthquakes in the state. This fault is a normal, or dip-slip fault, responsible for several small tremors each year, smaller than magnitude 2.7.

The Nemaha Ridge is about 50 miles east of the Midcontinent rift, a layer of basaltic rock that's very old, around 1.1 billion years. This rift (tear) stretches from Lake Superior in the north to Kansas in the south. In Kansas, the Central Kansas Uplift, with has faults, caused some small earthquakes in the late 1980s. According to Don Steeples, a geophysicist from the United States Geological Survey, earthquake activity has decreased in the Humboldt Zone but increased in the Uplift region.

The Humboldt Fault Zone, found here, is responsible for many earthquakes in Kansas. This fault goes through Permian rock and might be more complicated than people thought before. The earthquake was felt across a huge area, about , although some sources listed the felt area as , or . This broad reach happened because of the specific geology in the region. Unlike coastal areas where earthquakes are often confined to smaller regions, in Kansas, they spread out widely due to the firm ground and their relatively shallow depth.

In February 2016, there was a earthquake that hit Oklahoma, with a magnitude of 5.1. It made the ground shake in the Manhattan area, and this was reported in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America. A study discovered 100 earthquakes on the Richter scale between December 1977 and June 1989 using a seismograph network. These quakes varied in size, with the strongest being a 4.0 on the Richter scale and the weakest measuring 0.8.

At 20:22 UTC, or around 2:30 local time, the big earthquake hit in Kansas. It was categorized as a very strong earthquake with a maximum Mercalli intensity scale of VII. It caused minor damage across a wide area, affecting 22 counties in Kansas, and injuries were reported. The earthquake caused various types of damage, such as breaking walls, knocking down chimneys, and harming buildings, even causing stones to come loose. In Manhattan, near the epicenter, clocks stopped, and residents felt electrical shocks. The following day, there was an aftershock between 3 and 4 a.m. Damage in Manhattan and other communities might have been made worse by them being low-lying valleys.

At a farm south of the city of Wamego, the earthquake caused liquefaction of the ground. To the north of Wamego, in the city of Louisville, the earthquake caused harm to horses. In both Louisville and the city of Leavenworth, chimneys falls. In Paola, the earthquake destroyed one wall in a newspaper office building. Waves were seen on the Kansas River, reaching in height. The city of Atchison felt two shocks, which fell lamps and bottles in a drug store, buildings shook, and water flow in rivers and creeks was disrupted.

In Emporia, there was an earthquake with a low rumbling sound, windows shook, and small boxes fell off shelves as people ran out of buildings. In Lawrence, it felt three earthquakes in just 30 seconds, causing doors and windows to shake violently, plaster to break, and a loud rumbling noise. The city of Fort Scott only trembled, while Iola had shaking houses and tableware. Holton saw items knocked off shelves, and buildings shook. Irving residents heard rumbling before severe tremors lasting 30 seconds. In Junction City, buildings shook violently, moving several inches. Kansas City experienced tables moving, cracked walls, spilled water, cracked plaster, and general panic.

In Lawrence, it felt three earthquakes in just 30 seconds, causing doors and windows to shake violently, plaster to break, loud rumbling noise, and overturned stove. Leavenworth felt three shocks, causing a man being knocked off a hayload, a rumbling noise, and stopped clocks. Lecompton's Lane University building shook, and Marysville's high school shook violently.

In Montgomery County, people in moving vehicles did not feel the earthquake. In Mound City, Ottawa, Olathe, and Oskaloosa, many houses shook. In Oskaloosa, the cupola (dome) of a new school wobbled. A train on the Pacific Railroad in Solomon shook violently, prompting evacuation. In Topeka, the ceiling of a Methodist church bent, and nearly all windows in one schoolhouse were destroyed. White Cloud felt two shocks, and Wyandotte County residents were awakened.

Reports from Iowa and Missouri describe fallen plaster in Dubuque, shaking buildings in Des Moines, and cracked plaster in Chillicothe. Dubuque, Iowa had three shocks, during which gas burners shook, there was panic among residents, rattled windows, shaken chairs, newspaper cases, and even made holes in brick walls. In St. Joseph, Missouri, windows broke, some women fainted, and a loud rumbling noise happened.

The Chicago Tribune, in its article "At Leavenworth, Kansas", said that the earthquake was a complete surprise. They described it as sudden and said that it scared everyone because earthquakes were not common in the past.

The Chicago Tribune write a article about a big earthquake in Kansas. One article called "At Kansas City" said the earthquake shook homes suddenly and made a loud noise like thunder. Another article called, "At Leavenworth, Kansas", says that the earthquake was a surprise, and people were scared.

Earthquakes are not common in Kansas. A strong one could be a big problem for the state. If an earthquake happens, it would probably happen at the Nemaha Ridge, which is still active. There is also the Humboldt Fault Zone near the Ridge. If an earthquake were to hit there, it could break the nearby Tuttle Creek Dam, releasing a lot of water and flooding the nearby area. This would put about 13,000 people and 5,900 homes in danger. Since 2013, more than 500 earthquakes have happened in the state. The United States Army Corps of Engineers found that a earthquake between 5.7 and 6.6 could make the ground under the dam turn into quicksand. That would make the dam stretch out and the top of the dam drop by up to three feet. A big earthquake could make holes in the dam, letting water go through and eventually destroying the dam. Earthquakes that might be bad for the dam happen roughly every 1,800 years. The Corps of Engineers has made the dam stronger because of this. They replaced the sand under the dam with more than 350 walls and added sensors connected to alarms to warn people nearby if there is an earthquake.

Since 2013, over 500 earthquakes have been recorded in the state, which has reawakened old fault lines. In 2016, the United States Geological Survey made maps showing the earthquake risk for the state, and they found that there is a 1% or lower chance of a big earthquake in the next year. Because Sedgwick County and Wichita could experience shaking from earthquakes that existing building codes can not handle, officials in the area have suggested changing the building codes to address this risk. Scientists at the United States Geological Survey believe that there is still a possibility of a 7.0 magnitude earthquake, possibly originating from the Nemaha Ridge where the earthquake hit.

The Boswell Sisters

The Boswell Sisters were an American close harmony singing trio. They were three sisters: Martha Boswell (June 9, 1905 – July 2, 1958), Connie Boswell (later spelled "Connee", December 3, 1907 – October 11, 1976), and Helvetia "Vet" Boswell (May 20, 1911 – November 12, 1988). They came from uptown New Orleans. The group blended intricate harmonies and song arrangements featuring effects such as scat, instrumental imitation, ‘Boswellese’ gibberish, tempo and meter changes, major/minor juxtaposition, key changes, and incorporation of sections from other songs. They were famous in the United States in the 1930s at the end of the Jazz Age and the start of the Great Depression.

After the trio split in 1936, Connie continued as a solo vocalist in radio, film, and later television for an additional quarter century. The trio's "unique singing style and ground-breaking arrangements fused 'blackness' and 'whiteness' in music," and their collaborations with "the preeminent white swing musicians of their day—the Dorsey Brothers, Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, Joe Venuti, Eddie Lang, Artie Shaw, Victor Young, and Bunny Berigan—had a big effect on the development of the big band sound in the 1930s.

They recorded a song called Rock and Roll in 1933.

Jazz Age

Raorchestes coonoorensis

The Coonoor bush frog ("Raorchestes coonoorensis") is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place, in the Western Ghat mountains, between 1,780 and 2083 meters above sea level.

People have seen this frog on large farms and in forests that human beings have changed. People saw the frogs sitting on leaves 1-1.5 m over the ground. Like other frogs in "Raorchestes", this frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog and is never a tadpole.

The frog is endangered because humans changed the places where it lives too much, for example to build roads and other things for paying visitors. Chemicals meant to kill pests can also kill this frog.

Raorchestes chromasynchysi

The confusing green bush frog or variable bush frog ("Raorchestes chromasynchysi") is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it in the Western Ghat mountains. People have seen it between 800 and 1500 meters above sea level.

This frog lives in a special kind of forest called a shola forest. These forests are high in the hills, and they have evergreen trees and shrubs. People have also seen it on coffee and cardamom farms. Like other frogs in "Raorchestes", this frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog.

Scientists say this frog is in some danger of dying out because it lives in a few small places, because it is hard for the frogs to move between those places, and because human beings still change those faces, especially to make coffee farms.

Raorchestes kollimalai

The Kollimalai bush frog ("Raorchestes kollimalai") is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it exactly one place in the Western Ghat mountains, about 1100 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is 15–45 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of the frog's back is light brown with darker brown spots and marks. There is a dark brown stripe on each side of its head. The stripe goes from the eye over the ear to the frog's shoulder. The pupil of the eye is black in color with gold in it.

Scientists named this frog Kollimalai after the place where they found it.

Tiberius was elevated to augustus by Justin II and shortly afterwards he became sole ruler of the Eastern Roman Empire.

Jarya

Jarya is the name for a certain type of enslaved women and slave girls in the Islamic world of the Middle Ages. Other names include jariyah and jawaris. They were "Slaves for pleasure" (muṭʿa, ladhdha) or slave girls for sexual intercourse ((jawārī al-waṭ). They had received an artistic education. Unlike the Qiyan, they usually did not perform outside the harem of their master. 

Usually, Jarya were bought on the slave market, or they were captured in a war as a form of booty. They are mainly known because they were able to entertain a man with their artistic skills or their knowledge, rather than sexuality and physical beauty.

Royal harems often employed many jawaris, who acted as the entertainers of the royal harem and who were not necessarily the concubines of the ruler. The Abbasid harem had thousands of jawaris as well as concubines. The harems of many other Islamic rulers, did the same, such as the harems of the Caliphate of Cordoba and the Fatimid Caliphate.

In the 9th-century, writer Al-Jahiz described the sexual harem slaves. He also said that with their artistic skills they had a destructive influence over their owners. According to him, these skills created a web of dependent feelings such as love (hub), passion (hawa) affinity (mushakala) and a wish for continued companionship (ilf).

Nothing Else Matters

"Nothing Else Matters" is the third single off of American metal band Metallica's fifth studio album "Metallica". The song was released on April 20, 1992.

The song was able to make it to #11 on the Mainstream Rock and #34 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 charts. It was also certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). 

When he wrote the song, James Hetfield didn't want to show it to the band at first. Hetfield said in an interview with "Metal Hammer": "I thought that Metallica could only be the four of us. These are songs about destroying things, head banging, bleeding for the crowd, whatever it is, as long as it wasn't about chicks and fast cars, even though that's what we liked. The song was about a girlfriend at the time. It turned out to be a pretty big song."

A music video for the song was released. In the video, the band is recording the song in a studio. Footage of the band doing different things like shooting a basketball, donating money to a disabled veteran and choosing album artwork are shown.

Qiyan

' (, ; singular ', , ) were a social class of women which existed in the pre-modern Islamic world. They were trained as entertainers. The term was used for both slaves, and free women who had this role. Some of these women came from the nobility. The flourished under the Umayyad Caliphate, the Abbasid Caliphate, and in Al-Andalus.

Very often the word is translated as 'singing girls' or 'singing slave girls'. There were also older Quiyan. They were skilled entertainers, and their skills were more than singing; it included for example dancing, composing music and verse, reciting historical or literary anecdotes (), calligraphy, or shadow-puppetry. Other translations include courtesan, musical concubines, or simply women musicians.

Some sources see quiyan as a subset of jawāri, female slaves, or even more specific, slave girls. Sometimes, qiyan are called slave-girl poets. Many were free women. One of them was even an Abbasid princess.

The word comes from the female form of blacksmith, craftsman. The term was used for manual labourers, anyone paid to do work. Later, it referred to people doing an artistic performance for a reward. From here, its feminine form came to have the meaning of a female performer of various arts, in a specific role.

Like other slaves in the Islamic world, were legally sexually available to their owners. They were often associated in literature with licentiousness, and sexuality was an important part of their appeal, but they do not seem to have been prostitutes.

There were also common who performed for the public in common -houses, and these houses were in some cases brothels.

It is not clear how early the institution of the emerged, but certainly flourished during the ‘Abbasid period.

Often, slave girls that were not that beautifuil were made Qiyan; often they also had a darker skin. It is not certain that these claims were accurate. One social phenomenon that can be seen as a successor to the is the Egyptian , courtesans or female entertainers in Medieval Egypt, educated to sing and recite classical poetry and to discourse wittily.

There are many stories about qiyan, especially of female slaves. For this reason, they are important in the history of slavery in the Islamic world. Many female poets of the Arab world in the Middle ages were qiyan. For a few , it is possible to give quite a full biography. Important medieval sources of include a treatise by al-Jahiz (776–868/869 CE), Abu Tayyib al-Washsha's () by ibn al-Sāʿī, and (Choice Anecdotes from the Accounts of Concubines) by al-Suyuti (). Many of these sources recount the repartee of prominent , though there are hints that in less wealthy households were used by their owners to attract gifts. In the 'Abbasid period, were often educated in the cities of Basra, Ta'if, and Medina.

It has been suggested that "the geisha of Japan are perhaps the most comparable form of socially institutionalized female companionship and entertainment for [men]", but there are also many differences.

The institution of declined with the Abbasid Caliphate. When it first broke apart, this did not have a direct impact. The did not take sides in political disputes. However, political instability led to tax mismanagement. Also, the new class of Turkish soldiers wanted to be paid more. This meant there was less money in the treasury. It also meant that artistic activity could not be funded.

Citizens who used the services of qiyān, were thought to be rich. Soldiers also asked citizens for money, who they thought would be rich. This made ostentatious behavior risky.
It seems that for the first century or so in al-Andalus, were brought west after being trained in Medina or Baghdad. They might also have been trained by artists from the east. In the 11th century the Caliphate of Córdoba collapsed. At that time, were often trained in Córdoba rather than imported after training. It seems that while female singers still existed, enslaved ones were no longer found in al-Andalus in the 14th century CE.

Gunship

A gunship (not to be confused with a gunboat) is a military aircraft armed with heavy aircraft guns, primarily intended for attacking ground targets either as airstrike or as close air support.

In modern usage the term "gunship" refers to fixed-wing aircraft having laterally-mounted heavy armaments (i.e. firing to the side) to attack ground or sea targets. The term "gunship" originated in the mid-19th century as a synonym for gunboat and also referred to the heavily armed ironclad steamships used during the American Civil War.

The term helicopter gunship is commonly used to describe armed helicopters.

During World War II, the urgent need for hard-hitting attack aircraft led to the development of the heavily armed gunship versions of the North American B-25 Mitchell.

In the more modern, post-World War II fixed-wing aircraft category, a gunship is an aircraft having laterally-mounted heavy armaments (i.e. firing to the side) to attack ground or sea targets. 

The Douglas AC-47 Spooky was the first notable modern gunship.

Gunboat

A gunboat is a naval watercraft. It is designed for carrying one or more guns to bombard coastal targets, as opposed to those military craft designed for naval warfare, or for ferrying troops or supplies.

Gunboats were used since prior to the stream era, they changed with it. They were used in the American Civil War and were also used in e.g. World War I and II, and the Vietnam War.

In the age of sail, a gunboat was usually a small undecked vessel carrying a single smoothbore cannon in the bow, or just two or three such cannons. A gunboat could carry one or two masts or be oar-powered only, but the single-masted version of about length was most typical. Some types of gunboats carried two cannons, or else mounted a number of swivel guns on the railings.

All navies of the sailing era kept a number of gunboats on hand. 

With the introduction of steam power in the early 19th century, the Royal Navy and other navies built considerable numbers of small vessels propelled by side paddles and later by screws. Initially, these vessels retained full sailing rigs and used steam engines for auxiliary propulsion.

Gunboats experienced a revival during the American Civil War (1861–1865). Union and Confederate forces quickly converted existing passenger-carrying boats into armed sidewheel steamers. Later, some purpose-built boats, such as , joined the fray. They frequently mounted 12 or more guns, sometimes of rather large caliber, and usually carried some armor. At the same time, Britain's gunboats from the Crimean War period were starting to wear out, so a new series of classes was ordered. Construction shifted from a purely wooden hull to an iron–teak composite.

In the later 19th century and early 20th century, "gunboat" was the common name for smaller armed vessels. These could be classified, from the smallest to the largest, into river gunboats, river monitors, coastal-defense gunboats (such as ), and full-fledged monitors for coastal bombardments. In the 1870s and 1880s, Britain took to building so-called "flat-iron" (or Rendel) gunboats for coastal defence. When there would be few opportunities to re-coal, vessels carrying a full sailing rig continued in use as gunboats; , a sloop preserved at Chatham Historic Dockyard in the United Kingdom, exemplifies this type of gunboat.

In the United States Navy, these boats had the hull classification symbol "PG", which led to their being referred to as "patrol gunboats". They usually displaced under , were about long, draught and sometimes much less, and mounted several guns of calibers up to . An important characteristic of these was the ability to operate in rivers, enabling them to reach inland targets in a way not otherwise possible before the development of aircraft. In this period the naval powers used gunboats for police actions in colonies or in weaker countries, for example in China (see e.g. Yangtze Patrol). This category of gunboat inspired the term "". With the addition of torpedoes, they became "torpedo gunboats", designated by the hull classification symbol "PTG" (Patrol Torpedo Gunboat).

US riverine gunboats in the Vietnam War, included Patrol Boats River (PBR), constructed of fiberglass; Patrol Craft Fast (PCF), commonly known as Swift Boats, built of aluminum; and Assault Support Patrol Boats (ASPB) built of steel. U.S. Coast Guard 82-foot s supplemented these US Navy vessels. The ASPBs were commonly referred to as "Alpha" boats and primarily carried out mine-sweeping duties along the waterways, due to their all-steel construction. The ASPBs were the only US Navy riverine craft specifically designed and built for the Vietnam War. All of these boats were assigned to the US Navy's "Brownwater Navy".




Slavery in 21st-century jihadism

In the 21st century, many Islamist groups, such as Boko Haram, or ISIS, have captured and enslaved women and children, often for sexual slavery. In 2014 in particular, both groups organised mass kidnappings of large numbers of girls and younger women. They say that they lead a war against "infidels".

The fighters get the enslaved girls and women as a compensation for their fighting to rebuild the Caliphate.

The first report of slave-taking by Boko Haram was on 13 May 2013. At that time, a video was released. In it, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau said his group had taken women and children - including teenage girls - hostage in response to the arrest of its members' wives and children.

According to Islamism expert Jonathan N.C. Hill, Boko Haram began kidnapping large numbers of girls and young women for sexual use in 2014.

The attacks were similar to Algerian Islamists in the 1990s and early 2000s. The group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has probably influenced Boko Haram with this.

The BBC quoted a community leader from Borno state. He said that some of captured young women and teenage girls held by Boko Haram have been forced to marry one Boko Haram fighter after another as the fighters are killed. "Any time they go for an operation and one of the fighters is killed they will force the young woman to marry another one. Eventually she becomes a sex slave."

"The Economist" reports that ISIS (also called "Islamic State") has taken "as many as 2,000 women and children" captive, selling and distributing them as sexual slaves. Some women were reportedly sold via auction and even via online auction to Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. Matthew Barber, a scholar of Yazidi history at the University of Chicago, later stated to have compiled a list of 4,800 captured Yazidi women and children, and estimated that the overall number could be up to 7,000. Yazidi are a small minority who practice a religion based on "a mix of Christian, Islamic, and ancient Mesopotamian beliefs".

According to reports "The Daily Telegraph" said were credible, virgins among the captured women were selected and given to commanders as sexual slaves. According to an August 2015 story in "The New York Times", "The trade in Yazidi women and girls has created a persistent infrastructure, with a network of warehouses where the victims are held, viewing rooms where they are inspected and marketed, and a dedicated fleet of buses used to transport them."

In April 2015, Zainab Bangura, the United Nations special envoy on sexual violence in conflict, visited Iraq. She received a copy of an Islamic State pamphlet including a list of prices for captured women and children. According to a story on the list in Bloomberg, the list's authenticity "was established by UN researchers who'd gathered anecdotes on similar slave markets in Islamic State-controlled areas". The captives are non-Muslim minorities, "mostly Arab Christians and Yazidis" who have refused to convert to Islam and whose adult male relatives have been murdered. Bidders for the captive women and children include "the groups own fighters and wealthy Middle Easterners".

Kafkania pebble

The Kafkania pebble is a pebble, small in size, and round in shape, found on 1 April 1994, near a river in Kafkania, north of Olympia. The pebble contains some Mycenaean Greek words, including a image of a labrys. The text and image on the pebble is suggested to have come from the 17th century BC. If the pebble is truly a ancient artifact, it would have been the earliest writing to come from Greece, and by far the earliest document written in Mycenaean Greek. However, it is most likely a modern-day hoax.

There is an short inscription consisting of three words written on the pebble, probably reading as:
On the other side of the pebble, there is a image of a labrys.

Some believe that the inscription is written in Mycenaean Greek, but it is disputed.

G. Owens suggested that the inscription is written in Minoan, rather than Mycenaean Greek. Then, a Minoan could have written the text for a Mycenaean. No evidence exists that the Mycenaeans wrote text before the 14th century BC.

Enter Sandman

"Enter Sandman" is the third single off of American metal band Metallica's fifth studio album "Metallica". The song was released on July 29, 1991.

The song was able to make it to #10 on the Mainstream Rock, #16 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, and "RPM'"s Canada Top Singles charts. Both the physical and mastertone releases were certified Gold and the digital release was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was nominated for "Best Rock Song" at the 34th Grammy Awards but lost to Sting's "The Soul Cages".

When they were writing the song, Hetfield at first had "Disrupt the perfect family" which he wrote about sudden infant death syndrome. He wanted this instead of "Off to never never land". He also wanted the sandman to kill the baby but said that it was too corny. In an interview with "Uncut", Hetfield said "I wanted more of the mental thing where this kid gets manipulated by what adults say. And you know when you wake up with that shit in your eye? That's supposedly been put in there by the sandman to make you dream. So the guy in the song tells this little kid that and he kinda freaks. He can't sleep after that and it works the opposite way.

FC Libertas Wien

FC Libertas Wien (Latin for freedom) was an Austrian football club from Ottakring, a district of Vienna. From 1932 to 1937 he played for a total of five seasons in the first division.
Libertas was founded in 1914 by some high school students. Among them were Josef Gerö, later ÖFB President, UEFA Vice President and Minister of Justice, and Karl Zankl, later WFV President. The rapid-enthusiastic students chose green and white as the colors of their club. The club played in the lower Viennese leagues for several years. A brief merger in 1922 with the Josefstädter Sportfreunde broke up, until 1928 the club did not get beyond the third class. Nevertheless, the club produced two later internationally very successful players in Josef Horejs and Walter Nausch, who were able to win the Mitropapokal with Sparta Prague and FK Austria Wien.

In 1927 the club merged with the second-rate SC International Vienna to form the International Libertas. The club appeared as FC Libertas Vienna from the following season in 1928/29. They reached the 2nd division championship in 1931/32 and were promoted to the 1st division. The first game in Austria's highest division took place in front of 16,000 spectators on 27 August 1932 against Rapid and ended 0-0. Libertas played the first few years against relegation. Since the Libertas sports field was too small for the 1st league, the club first played at Dornbacher Sport-Club-Platz and later at Wacker Wien Schönbrunner Platz.

The 1934/35 season was the highlight of the club's history, and the club finished fifth behind Rapid, Vienna, Admira and Wacker. In 1936 the club was able to reach to the semi-finals of the ÖFB Cup. In 1937, due to the reduction of the league to ten clubs, the club was relegated. The outbreak of the Second World War meant that the Libertas merged with the district rivals SC Red Star Vienna in 1941 in order to be able to guarantee further game operations. This ended the history of the only Ottakringer first division club since there was no reactivation after the end of the war.

A music video for the song was released. It was directed by JMP. In the video, a man looks in the mirror and carries a gun out of his house. He enters a car filled with Xen and a crew. They all put on balaclavas and drive around the hood. They enter a auto parts shop and rob the people at gunpoint. The video goes ahead a few decades and an older Xen is telling a story to children outside of XXXTentacion's mausoleum.

Odalisque

An odalisque (, ) was a chambermaid or a female attendant in a Turkish seraglio, particularly the court ladies in the household of the Ottoman sultan. 

In western usage, the term came to mean the harem concubine. They were often shown in paintings.
They started a genre. In these pictures, a woman is shown mostly or completely nude in a reclining position, often in the setting of a harem.

In the original usage of the term, an odalisque was at the lower social levels of a harem. "Odalıklar" did not serve the master of the harem. They served his wives and concubines as a chambermaid. Usually, odalikar were slaves, that were given to the Sultan by wealthy Turkish men. Most of the time, they were slaves from Georgia, or Circassia.

Generally, an "odalık" was never seen by the sultan but instead remained under the direct supervision of his mother, the Valide sultan.

If an "odalık" was very beautiful or had exceptional talents in dancing or singing, she would be trained as a possible concubine. If selected, an "odalık" trained as a court lady and would serve the sultan sexually. Only after such sexual contact would she change in status, becoming one of the consorts of the sultan.

Note that the contacts between the sultan, his sons, and the girls and women of the harem were strictly regulated. Most members of the harem had to lead a life of sexual abstinence. In that way, a harem was more like a monastery. 

Umm al walad

Umm al-walad () was a title given to a slave-concubine who had given birth to her master's child.Since this concubine was the property of her master, she could be sold or given away, like any other slave. This was also the view of Muhammad. Umar had a different view: When he was caliph, he made a policy that prohibited owners from selling or gifting their umm al-walads. Also, when her owner died, the Umm-al-walad would be freed. Ali, who was Umar's cousin, and later a caliph, opposed this ruling. He said it was different from what Muhammad had said.

Shiism took Ali's view. It also introduced temporary marriages. Sunni Muslims take Umar's view.
As the child is a child of her owner, the child is considered freeborn, and legitimate. In 740, Zayd ibn Ali tried to overthrow the caliphate. This marked a turning point for caliphs with slave mothers. In 744, Yazid III was the first Umayyad caliph with a slave mother.The last three Umayyad caliphs, and most Abbasid caliphs had slave mothers. 

If a slave had a child, and the slave owner did not say it legitimate, the slave was faced with zina charges. The usual penalty for zina is stoning.

While India was fighting for independence, the freedom for India to be ruled by itself, C. Rajagopalachari, who would later become independent India's first Governor-General, started a salt walk in Vedaranyam that was similar to the Dandi March started by Gandhi in 1930 to fight against the sales tax forced on getting salt from the sea.

Islamic views on slavery

Before Islam started, there was slavery. Muhammad and his successors used slaves, and did not change slavery much. They also used slaves as concubines.

The work that slaves did, and the trading of slaves was important in Islamic society. In the 19th century, under the influence of colonialism, slavery was gradually abolished. Despite this, there are some conditions resembling slavery which continue to exist in some predominantly Muslim countries.

With the abolition of slavery, all Muslim countries have signed documents abolishing it. Some jihadist organizations continue to practice it, though.

Chandralekha

Chandralekha is a 1948 Indian adventure movie. It was made by S. S. Vasan of Gemini Studios. The movie stars T. R. Rajakumari, M. K. Radha, and Ranjan. It tells the story of two brothers, Veerasimhan and Sasankan. They argue about ruling their dad's kingdom and marrying a village dancer named Chandralekha.

Development started in the 1940s. Before this one, Vasan had two very famous movies. He said his next movie would be "Chandralekha". Veppathur Kittoo, a storyboard artist, made a story from a chapter in George W. M. Reynolds' book "Robert Macaire: or, The French Bandit in England". T. G. Raghavachari was the original director but left midway because of disagreements with Vasan. Vasan then directed a movie himself for the first time.

Originally in Tamil and later Hindi, "Chandralekha" took five years to make (1943-1948). There were many changes in the script, or movie plan. It was India's most expensive, or costly movie at the time. Vasan used all his money and sold his jewelry to complete it. Kamal Ghosh and K. Ramnoth were the cinematographers. The music, influenced by Indian and Western classical music, was by S. Rajeswara Rao and M. D. Parthasarathy with lyrics by Papanasam Sivan and Kothamangalam Subbu.

"Chandralekha" released on 9 April 1948. The movie got good reviews but didn't make enough money. Vasan made a Hindi version with changes, new cast, and Hindi talking by Agha Jani Kashmiri and Pandit Indra. The Hindi version released on 24 December and did very well at the box office. This movie made South Indian cinema famous in India and gave a very good reason for South Indian producers to sell their Hindi films in North India.

Veerasimhan and Sasankan are the king's sons. Veerasimhan rides through a village. He meets Chandralekha, a dancer. They fall in love. Later the king decides to give the throne to Veerasimhan. Sasankan gets angry. He forms a group of thieves. They do crimes. Chandralekha's father is hurt and dies. Chandralekha becomes an orphan, someone with no parents. She joins a group of travelling musicians. Whilst they were travelling, Sasankan's gang attacks their caravan.

Sasankan tells Chandralekha to dance. She dances after Sasanken hits her, but then she escapes. Sasankan later captures Veerasimhan. Chandralekha sees Sasankan's men put Veerasimhan in a cave and hide it with a big rock. Chandralekha saves him with circus elephants. They join the circus to hide from Sasankan's men. Sasankan goes back to the palace, locks up his parents, becomes the king, and sends a spy to find Chandralekha.

The spy sees Chandralekha at the circus. The spy tries to catch her. Veerasimhan saves her. They join gypsies. When Veerasimhan goes to try to get help, Sasankan's men find Chandralekha. They take her to the palace. Sasankan tries to get Chandralekha to love him. She pretends to faint. A circus friend comes as a healer and hides that she is a friend. They talk in secret. Sasankan is happy that Chandralekha is okay. Chandralekha pretends to be cured and agrees to marry Sasankan. She wants a drum dance at the royal wedding, and he agrees.

Large drums are in rows near the palace. Chandralekha joins the dancers on the drums. Sasankan is impressed by Chandralekha's dance. Veerasimhan's soldiers hide in the drums. The dance finishes, and they attack Sasankan's men. Veerasimhan and Sasankan do a long sword fight. Sasankan loses and is put in prison. Veerasimhan becomes the new king, and Chandralekha is the queen. His parents are set free.

Cast from the the song book:

After the box office success of "Bala Nagamma" (1942) and "Mangamma Sabatham" (1943), producer S. S. Vasan of Gemini Studios wanted his next movie to be very big. He had no money limits. He asked K. J. Mahadevan, Kothamangalam Subbu, Sangu, Naina and Veppathur Kittoo—to write a screenplay, the movie story. They wanted a similar story to "Mangamma Sabatham" and "Bala Nagamma" because they were "heroine-oriented stories". The group shared Chandralekha's tale. She was strong. She tricked a mean bandit, cut his nose, and used hot red chili powder. Vasan didn't like the violence and rudeness. He said no but kept her name.

He announced "Chandralekha" without waiting for the story and advertised it a lot. But the story wasn't ready in three months. Vasan got impatient. He told the writers he would work on "Avvaiyyar" (1953) instead of "Chandralekha". After he gave them one more week, Kittoo found George W. M. Reynolds' book, "Robert Macaire; Or, the French Bandit in England". In the first chapter, he read:

Vasan was very happy when Kittoo told him a story based on the chapter. He started the film, and named the heroine Chandralekha. Although the story was created by Kittoo, the praise went to all of Gemini's story team. T. G. Raghavachari was hired as director.

The script had two main parts: the princes in a kingdom. The older was the hero, and the younger was the villain. M. K. Radha got the role of Sasankan, the young prince. He usually did hero roles, so he didn't want to be a villain. So, he agreed to be Veerasimhan, the older prince. His wife Gnanambal asked Vasan to cast Radha in the role. K. J. Mahadevan (a member of Gemini's story team) was chosen by Vasan to play Sasankan. Some footage filmed of Mahadevan. His performance seen as "too soft." He was removed; but, he stayed on the project as a scriptwriter and assistant director. Raghavachari suggested Ranjan as Sasankan. Vasan was unsure at first, thinking Ranjan was too soft for the very serious villain role. But later, Vasan agreed. Ranjan was busy with another movie, Saalivaahanan, but Kittoo convinced him to try for Chandralekha. Ranjan got a few days off, did a test, and it went well. So, Ranjan got the role.

Vasan's wanted K. L. V. Vasantha to play Chandralekha but T. R. Rajakumari was chosen to play Chandralekha. movie historian Randor Guy thought Vasan chose Rajakumari instead of Vasantha because she was leaving Gemini for Modern Theatresstudio. In April 1947, N. S. Krishnan got out of jail. He was earlier found guilty in the Lakshmikanthan murder case but was released when he appealed; Vasan hired him and T. A. Mathuram. They played circus artists. They helped Veerasimhan save Chandralekha from Sasankan. Mathuram's character was named Sumathi. The script got changed. New scenes were added. P. A. Subbiah Pillai played Chandralekha's father. This was Madurai Sriramulu Naidu and S. N. Lakshmi's first movie; Naidu played a horseman, and Lakshmi was a dancer in the ending drum-dance scene.

The struggling actor V. C. Ganeshamurthy wanted a small role in "Chandralekha". He contacted Kittoo many times. Ganeshamurthy grew his hair long for a part as Veerasimhan's bodyguard. Kittoo introduced him to Vasan. Vasan watched his stage performance. Vasan rejected him for his movie, saying he was unfit. Vasan suggested Ganeshamurthy choose another profession. This caused a very long fight between Vasan and Ganeshamurthy. The role of the bodyguard went to N. Seetharaman, later known as Javar Seetharaman. Kothamangalam Subbu's wife, Sundari Bai, played a circus performer who helps Chandralekha escape from Sasankan.

T. A. Jayalakshmi, in one of her earliest movie roles, was there for a short scene as a dancer. Veppathur Kittoo played Sasankan's spy and was an assistant director. Studio staff, families, and passers-by joined as extra people. They played spectators, or viewers in circus scenes. Vasan introduced Chandralekha in the movie during her circus performance with a voice-over.
 "Chandralekha" started filming in 1943. Raghavachari directed most of the movie. But he had disagreements with Vasan about scenes at the Governor's Estate (now Raj Bhavan, Guindy). So, he left the project. Vasan then took over for his first time directing.

The movie didn't have circus scenes at first. Vasan added them later during production. The script changed for that scene. Hundreds of circus elephants were used to free Veerasimhan from a cave. Kittoo traveled South India and Ceylon (Sri Lanka). He saw 50+ circuses. He chose Kamala Circus and Parasuram Lion Circus; Vasan hired Kamala for a month. The circus scenes were filmed by K. Ramnoth. Below, find Kittoo talking about the cameraperson's job:In those days, we had no zoom lenses and yet Ramnoth did it. One night, while Chandralekha is performing on the flying trapeze, she notices the villain's henchman in the front row. She is on her perch high up and he is seated in a ringside chair. Shock hits her and to convey the shock the camera zooms quickly from her to the man. Today, with a fast zoom shot it can be done very easily, but there was no such lens forty years ago. Ramnoth did it using the crane. He planned it well and rehearsed the shot for long. He took the shot 20 times and selected the best "take".Raghavachari left. The drum-dance scene he did stayed. It had 400 dancers. They rehearsed daily for six months. A. K. Sekhar designed it. and Jayashankar choreographed it. Kamal Ghosh filmed it with four cameras. Randor Guy thought it cost ₹500,000 (about US$105,000 in 1948). Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai estimated it cost ₹200,000, which was the whole budget for a typical Tamil movie at that time. The scene included the Kathakali and Bharatanatyam classical dances and the Sri Lankan Kandyan dance. A. Vincent, who later became a famous cinematographer and director in Malayalam cinema, helped Ghosh in this film.

In post-production, Vasan asked Ramnoth about a scene with warriors saving Chandralekha. Others liked it, but Ramnoth worried about the suspense. They talked, and Vasan told Chandru to edit as Ramnoth suggested. It worked well. C. E. Biggs was the audio engineer..

"Chandralekha" took five years (1943–1948) to make. The story, cast, and filming changed a lot, which caused delays and extra costs. The movie cost ₹3 million in 1948, making it the most expensive Indian movie at the time. Vasan used all his money, got help from The Hindu editor Kasturi Srinivasan, and sold his jewelry to complete the film. According to historian S. Muthiah, it was the first movie outside the United States with a budget of over a million dollars due to fluctuating exchange rates.

"Chandralekha" is not a historical movie even though it is a period film. It's based on "Robert Macaire"'s first chapter. Sasankan is like Macaire, and Chandralekha is influenced by Western stories like "Blood and Sand, The Mark of Zorro, Robin Hood, The Thief of Baghdad," and "Ben-Hur". Jerzy Toeplitz said the characters act like gods in the Mahabharata. The story holds different episodes together like a circus. Uday Shankar's "Kalpana" inspired "Chandralekha". In the 2003 Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema, it's called a "period extravaganza".

The ending sword fight between Veerasimhan and Sasankan is similar to the fight in the 1894 novel, "The Prisoner of Zenda". In 1976, American movie historian William K. Everson said the comedians in "Chandralekha" were similar to Laurel and Hardy. French movie historian Yves Thoraval said that it "prefigured the dance that "Chandralekha" made famous the very next year." 

"Chandralekha" soundtrack was created by S. Rajeswara Rao, with the speech by Papanasam Sivan and Kothamangalam Subbu. R. Vaidyanathan and B. Das Gupta worked with M. D. Parthasarathy on the background music. Rajeswara Rao said that in a 1993 interview for "The Hindu" it took him over a year to create the film's music: "As the dancers performed, we used to rehearse and compose the music. It was done with incredibly few instruments. We used a piano, ten double-bass violins, and drums from Africa, Egypt, and Persia which we have acquired from an African War troupe." Rao's payment was 1,500. The music was based by Carnatic and Hindustani music, Latin American and Portuguese folk music and Strauss waltzes. M. K. Raghavendra said that "Chandralekha" has "snatches from [Richard] Wagner and [Nikolai] Rimsky-Korsakov ("Scherezade") being used at dramatic moments."

"Naattiya Kuthirai," not part of the film, was added after during final production. Sundari Bai spent over a month practicing the song. M. D. Parthasarathy was the only singer of "Aathoram Kodikkalam" and also sang "Naattiya Kuthirai" with someone else. J. Cooling Rajaiah played the accordion and piano in the gypsy song of the movie. The circus song was from "The Donkey Serenade" in Robert Z. Leonard's 1937 movie, The Firefly. Vasan gave most of the songs on the Hindi soundtrack to Uma Devi, who became famously known as Tun Tun after. She first thought that the songs were too difficult for her, but Rajeswara Rao worked very much with her. "Sanjh Ki Bela," from the Hindi soundtrack, is based on "Sanjh Ki Bela Panchhi Akela" from Jwar Bhata (1944). Chandralekha's music helped it become one of the most successful Indian musical movies of the 1940s and gave a lot of ideas to many Tamil cinema music directors who liked Western music.

"Chandralekha" was released on 9 April 1948 in over 40 theatres in South India. A regular 1940s Tamil movie released in around ten towns. "Chandralekha" was released in 120 towns at once.

The movie was shown in Japan as in April 1954, where it was given out by Nippon Cinema Corporation (NCC). It was the first Tamil movie with speech in Japanese, and the second Indian movie that was shown in Japan. NCC later lost all its money, and no information about "Chandralekha" in Japan is available. A Danish copy of the film, "Indiens Hersker" ("India's Ruler"), was shown to the public on 26 April 1954. An English-language version of "Chandralekha", "Chandra", was shown in the United States and Europe during the 1950s.

Even though many people liked the movie and it earned a lot, there were no profits; Vasan remade it in Hindi to try to get profits. The Hindi version was given out by The Screens (a company in Bombay, now Mumbai), and it was shown to the public on 24 December 1948. It was very successful. Vasan called "Chandralekha" "a pageant for our peasants", for "the war-weary public that had been forced to watch insipid war propaganda pictures for years." It was selected by the Indian government for watching at the fourth International movie Festival in Prague in 1949. The movie's success made Madras a centre for Hindi films. Five years after "Chandralekha" success, Gemini paid its employees more money, one of the first studios in the world to do so.

In Japan, the movie got in ten days after its public showing in April 1954.

Raja Sen said that the film's set pieces, drum-dance sequence and the "longest swordfight ever captured on film" was very good in May 2010 on Rediff, saying that "Chandralekha" is "just the kind of film, in fact, that would be best appreciated now after digital restoration." Randor Guy was very happy with Rajakumari's acting in an October 2010 review, saying "Chandralekha" was her best movie and saying that she "carried the movie on her shoulders." 

For the English release of "Chandralekha", "The New York Times" called Rajakumari a "buxom beauty," meaning a curvy woman who looks nice. When the movie was played in New York City in 1976, William K. Everson said: "It's a colorful, naive (very little experience) and zestful (very happy) movie in which the overall ingenuousness quite disarms criticism of plot absurdity or such production shortcomings as the too-obvious studio 'exteriors'... Last, but far from least, Busby Berkeley would surely have been delighted to see his influence extending to the climactic drum dance."

The Hindi version of "Chandralekha" was Vasan's first movie in Hindi. Vasan took some scenes again and used a slightly different cast. Agha Jani Kashmiri and Pandit Indra wrote the words for the Hindi version, while Indra and Bharat Vyas wrote the words for the songs. Bal Krishna Kalla helped Rao on the Hindi songs, and Parthasarathy and Vaidyanathan created the Hindi background music. The Tamil movie was over long, but the Hindi movie was changed down to .

Sim racing

Sim Racing, short for "simulated racing", is a popular genre of video gaming that seeks to replicate the experience of real-world auto racing within a virtual environment. This immersive form of entertainment has gained a substantial following among motorsport enthusiasts and gaming communities worldwide.
Sim racing involves the use of specialized racing simulation software and hardware peripherals to create a realistic racing experience. Unlike conventional racing video games, sim racing places a strong emphasis on accuracy, striving to recreate the intricacies of real-world racing, including factors such as:


Before arcade-style and sim racing split, there were early driving simulation games, like Namco's 1982 game Pole Position. Atari promoted it as very realistic Formula 1 racing at the time.

Sim racing really started to grow in 1989 when Papyrus Design Group made Indianapolis 500: The Simulation. This game, created by David Kaemmer and Omar Khudari on 16-bit computers, is often seen as the first true racing simulation for personal computers.

F1 Racing Simulation by Ubisoft was one of the first to use this tech in 1997.

Later, Microprose released Grand Prix 3 with a better graphics engine, but it lacked full online multiplayer. Modders liked it because they could use stuff from the older game, GP2.

In 1998, Papyrus released Grand Prix Legends, praised for its physics and sound. It became a hit and led to online racing with VROC.

Even though it's old, GPL is still important in sim racing. They improved the physics and made expansions for later seasons, like 1969.

In 1997, Wired magazine had an article about racing sims called "Hard Drive."

Senedd constituencies and electoral regions

The Senedd, the unicameral parliament of Wales, has 40 single-member constituencies () and five multi-member electoral regions ().

The boundaries and names of the 40 constituencies are the same as those in the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament.

Electoral region

An electoral region is a type of multi-member constituency used to elect members of a legislature. They are used in many parts of the world, but often are elected in a different way.

In Australia, electoral regions are only used to elect the Victorian Legislative Council, the upper house of the Parliament of Victoria. They are elected using group voting tickets, a system that is quite controversial in Australia.

Electoral regions were also formerly used to elect the Western Australian Legislative Council, the upper house of the Parliament of Western Australia, using the same system as in Victoria. However, this system has been scrapped and from the 2025 state election and onward the Legislative Council will be elected using the same system as the New South Wales and South Australian Legislative Councils, which are the upper houses of the state parliaments of New South Wales and South Australia, respectively.

The Senedd, the unicameral parliament of Wales, uses electoral regions to elect some of its members. They are elected using the D'Hondt system.

During an interview with "Billboard", X's manager Solomon Sobande said that X made the song as a tribute to his Jamaican roots, saying: "That’s [X’s] culture. He’s of Jamaican descent. In the house he was probably listening to Bob Marley and all these guys. As he grows up and finds his own people, he was a huge fan of Vybz Kartel. Through his family’s descent, they had relationships with families like the Marleys. That’s how he [connected] with Ky-Mani [Marley]. It was a dream of him to get with Vybz at the time because he was locked up. Stefflon [Don] was the sprinkle on top, but that was really paying homage to his culture".

A music video for the song was released. In the video, shots of different places and people in Kingston are shown. Ky-Mani raps in front of soldier line of men. A memorial mural of X is shown. Stefflon raps in front of buff, shirtless men and beside a horse. Sikka Rhymes raps while people dance at a party. The video ends with people gathered around the memorial mural.

Documento de Identidad (Uruguay)

In Uruguay, the "Documento de Identidad," before known as "Cédula de identidad", is delivered by the Ministry of the Interior and the National Directorate of Civil Identification (DNIC) to the people. Everyone in Uruguay has to have this card for different things they need to do, whether it's with the government or private companies. This rule applies to everyone living in Uruguay, whether they were born there, became a citizen, or are just living there temporarily or permanently. Even babies who are 45 days old or older need to have this ID card.

Before 2015, the original name was ""Cédula de identidad"." It was a small card, about 9 cm wide and 5 cm tall, mostly light green in color. In the middle, it had the flag of the Thirty-Three Orientals with the words ""Libertad o muerte"." On the other side, there was a photo of the person, a unique number given by the D.N.I.C. (with a self-generated or verification digit), their full name and last names, and their signature (or a note if they couldn't sign).

The back of the card had information like nationality, date of birth, when the card was given, and when it would expire (usually 10 years after it was issued, but if you got it after you turned 70, it was valid for life, and for kids, it was valid for five years). It also had a thumbprint of the right thumb and any important notes. Since 2010, it also had a photo and a barcode.

People use this ID card for all sorts of things, like buying stuff with credit cards, proving who they are, showing their age, and more.

In 2015, Uruguay's ID card went through some big changes to make it more secure. It stopped 

being called the "Cédula de identidad" and became the "Documento de identidad."

The new ID card is made of a tough material called polycarbonate and is engraved with lasers. This makes it last for 10 years and stops people from erasing or changing the information because the laser burns the polycarbonate. It also has translations into Portuguese for words like "Apellido/Sobrenome" (Surname), "Nombre/Nome" (Name), "Vencimiento/Vencimento" (Expiry date), and others.

It has three levels of security:


The adult ID card has two chips:


For foreigners, the ID card is yellow and says "Extranjero" (Non-citizen) on it.

But, for naturalized citizens (people who became Uruguayan citizens), have an issue. Their ID cards don't follow international rules (ICAO 9303-3 7.1) because the D.N.I.C. lists the place where they were born instead of saying they are "Uruguayan." This can cause issues at airport gates and with immigration in other countries because it doesn't match up.

Minor's ID have no chips.

People who have the Uruguayan ID Document can go to all the countries in the Mercado Común del Sur (Mercosur) without needing a passport. There are nine countries in South America where this rule applies.


1944 (song)

"1944" is a 2016 song by Ukrainian singer Jamala. She sings in English and Crimean Tatar.

The song represented Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016. It won with 534 points.

"1944" is about the deportation of the Crimean Tatars in the 1940s. Singer Jamala's great-grandmother was deported during that time. Jamala's great-grandfather was a soldier in World War II. That is why he could not protect his family. The song also deals with the renewed repression of Crimean Tatars. Most Crimean Tatars do not accept the annexation.

The Crimean Tatar chorus is about not being allowed to live in your homeland. It therefore deals with the deportation of Jamala's great-grandmother.

The song won the contest with 534 points. That was a new record back then. The previous record was set by Alexander Rybak in 2009 with 387 points.

"1944" received 211 points from the official juries. The other 323 points came from the public televoting.

2022 AFC Women's Asian Cup

The 2022 AFC Women's Asian Cup was the 20th edition of the AFC Women's Asian Cup a competition where national teams from Asia, which are part of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), play against each other. India was chosen to be the host country in June 2020, and it was the first time they hosted it since 1979. Originally, the tournament was supposed to happen in late October and early November, but they changed the dates to 20 January to 6 February 2022.

This time, there were twelve teams in the tournament instead of the usual eight. The reason for this was that it also decided which Asian teams would get to play in the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Australia was already in the World Cup because they were hosting it. Five teams got to go to the World Cup straight from this tournament, and two more had a chance to play in a special playoff.

Japan had won the tournament the last two times, but this time they got knocked out in the semi-finals by China on penalties. China then won the tournament by beating South Korea 3-2 in the final.

Three football associations showed that they wanted to host the tournament before the deadline on 31st May 2019.

India had already hosted the 1980 AFC Women's Championship, which was initially planned for 1979. Chinese Taipei had hosted the tournament in 1977 and 2001.

The AFC Women's Football Committee suggested that India should host the tournament on 19th February 2020. Then, on 5th June 2020, India was officially given the rights to host the tournament.


Teams were ranked based on the number of points they earned in matches. They got 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss. If two or more teams had the same number of points, the following rules were used to decide who is ranked higher:


All the times mentioned are in the local time zone, which is IST (UTC+5:30).

The top two teams qualified for the quarter finals.
Due to the withdrawal of India in group A, results against the fourth-placed teams of each group B and C were not counted in determining the ranking of the third-placed teams.

American Wirehair

The American Wirehair is a breed of American cat. They are characterized by their curly, hard fur that covers their entire body.

American Wirehair is a natural mutation of the American Shorthair. It first occurred as a random mutation among five litters of kittens born to a pair of barn cats in Vernon, upstate New York, in 1966. The red-and-white male had a dense coat, and the cats' owner called local breeder Joan Ocea to see him. She bought the kitten, along with one of his normal litters of cats, for $50 and started a breeding program.

As the population grew, cats were exported to Canada and to Germany, where they were especially popular. The breed bred well and was recognized by the CFA in 1967, and by the Championship in 1978. Wirehaireds have yet to be recognized in England and Australia.

It is characterized by its stiff and frizzy coat. They are few in number and very rare. They are very active and curious. They are very proud and sometimes act intimidated by the presence of other cats. However, they are affectionate and mild-mannered. They are also playful and pampered, and love to play with people and be cuddled. Their coats are frizzy from the kitten stage, but it takes about six months for them to develop a coat similar to that of an adult cat. Although their fur is distinctive, it does not take much effort to care for it, just brushing the coat once a week or so. American Wirehairs have yet to make an appearance in Britain and Australia, among other countries.

When it was published, the work was an immediate success.The singing voice has been transposed so that the part can be sung by different voices.

As Schubert used music, he was able to express more feelings than the ballad alone. Among the feelings expressed are fear, desire, excitement. threat, and security. 

There are arrangements: Franz Liszt wrote a version for solo piano, Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst one for solo violin. Hector Berlioz wrote a version for orchestra and voice. Liszt later also wrote a version for orchestra, as did Max Reger.

Erlkönig (ballad)

Erlkönig is a ballad by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. He wrote it in 1782. Today, it is among his best-known works. 

The work has been set into music many times. Probably the most well-known setting is that by Franz Schubert.

Originally, the work was Danish, called "Ellerkonge", which means Elf-king. Johann Gottfried Herder translated it into German. The name Erlkönig came from the fact that elle was translated as Erle.(a tree, called alder, in English). In Danish, elle can mean both alder, and elf. 

The story of the Erlkönig derives from the traditional Danish ballad "Elveskud": Goethe's poem was inspired by Johann Gottfried Herder's translation of a variant of the ballad ("Danmarks gamle Folkeviser 47B", from Peter Syv's 1695 edition) into German as ("The Erl-King's Daughter") in his collection of folk songs, (published 1778). Goethe's poem then took on a life of its own, inspiring the Romantic concept of the Erlking. Niels Gade's cantata , Op. 30 (1854, text by ) was published in translation as .

An anxious young boy is being carried at night by his father on horseback. To where is not spelled out; German "Hof" has a rather broad meaning of "yard", "courtyard", "farm", or (royal) "court". The opening line tells that the time is late and that it is windy.

As the poem unfolds, the son claims to see and hear the "Erlkönig" (Erl-King). His father claims to not see or hear the creature, and he attempts to comfort his son, asserting natural explanations for what the child sees – a wisp of fog, rustling leaves, shimmering willows.

The Erl-King attempts to lure the child into joining him, promising amusement, rich clothes, and the attentions of his daughters. Finally, the Erl-King declares that he will take the child by force. The boy shrieks that he has been attacked, spurring the father to ride faster to the . Upon reaching the destination, the child is already dead.

Chartreux

The Chartreux is a breed of French cat. It is a very intelligent breed, devoted to its owners, patient, non-belligerent, and independent. It is also known as a calm and reserved cat.

The Chartreux appears in 16th century French literature. It describes a "Syrian cat" with a stocky build, woolly black-gray fur, and copper-colored eyes, which matches the appearance of the Chartreux. It is said that the Chartreux was brought to Europe during the Crusades. The two world wars of the 20th century brought the breed to the brink of extinction, but thanks to the efforts of breeders, it was saved. After World War I, French breeders selected the breeds that most closely resembled the Chartreux and crossbred them with it. By 1928, the breed was once again appearing in European cat shows, but World War II decimated France's native blue cat population. In the United States, the Chartreux was introduced in the 1970s.

There are two theories as to the origin of the name. The French Carthusian monks developed a liqueur called "Chartreuse," which is where the name "Chartreuse" comes from, or the name was given to a Spanish fleece in the early 18th century because of its resemblance to wool.

Chartreux has an unusually proportionate body shape for a cat. Their body type is semi-coby and they are quite large. Its head is broad and rounded, with small to medium-sized ears that sit on top of its head, just inside the edges. It has a sturdy body and slender legs. The eyes are large and round, and their color is mostly copper, but they can also have gold and yellow tints. Their bluish fur is short and dense, with a woolly coat that has a soft, silky texture. Their coat color belongs to the monochromatic section of the Traditional category, and while any shade of blue is acceptable, a silvery tinge is most desirable.

Its lyrics revolve around sexuality and romance. Critics noticed two distinct tones on the album, which Olivia identified as "softer R&B" alongside "harder hip hop" sounds. Olivia wrote six of the album's twelve tracks where she sings and raps.

"Olivia" is a R&B album consisting of twelve tracks. Critics had different opinions on its influences. According to MTV News' Shaheem Reid, the album features "R&B with elements of jazz and hip-hop". "Billboard"'s Richard B. Henderson referred to the songs as "a mixture of rap, R&B, and dance. "The Morning Call"'s Len Righi wrote the compositions were "sweet instrumental R&B" similar to those for Alicia Keys.

"Olivia" received a mixed response from critics. A "Honey" reviewer saw Olivia as a "real voice" in hip hop soul, and a "CMJ" critic saw the album as "unique and ground-breaking". A "Q" magazine reviewer wrote that Olivia was "well-versed in the not always noble art of the R&B ballad" and the music had "a list of saucy demands that would make Lil' Kim blush". In a "The Source" review, a contributor found Olivia to be the "most memorable when she's in woman-scorned mode" and compared her to "a thugged-out Aaliyah and pissed-off Mýa".

Five female University of Idaho students lived in a rented off-campus home in the 25,000-person rural college town of Moscow, Idaho, which had previously not seen a murder since 2015. A sixth person was listed on the lease but not home at the time of the murders. The three-story, home had six bedrooms; two on each floor.

The three female victims – Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, and Xana Kernodle – lived at the house, while the fourth victim, Ethan Chapin, was Kernodle's boyfriend who was sleeping over on the night of the attacks. Two other female roommates also lived at the house; they slept through the attacks, and were not injured.

In the early morning hours of Sunday, November 13, 2022, between 3am and 4am, four University of Idaho college students were stabbed to death in a shared rental home close to campus, in which three of them resided.

Earlier on Saturday evening, two of the four victims, Chapin and Kernodle, were at an on-campus party at the nearby Sigma Chi fraternity from 8pm to 9pm. Both returned home at 1:45am. That same evening, the other two victims, lifelong best friends Mogen and Goncalves, had gone to The Corner Club, a downtown sports bar at Main and 'A' Streets, at 10 pm, from which they departed at 1:30 am. A livestreamed video from Twitch from The Grub Truck, a food truck four blocks south at Friendship Square (Main and Fourth Streets), showed Mogen and Goncalves at 1:41 am, chatting and smiling, getting their food ten minutes later, and leaving to take what the police initially said was an Uber ride home, a trip of about . The police later rephrased their statement to say the ride was provided by a "private party," arriving home at 1:56 am.

All four individuals were home by 1:56am. Seven uncompleted phone calls were made from the phone of Goncalves to her former longtime boyfriend, Jack DuCoeur, a fellow student, from 2:26 to 2:52am. Mogen also called the boyfriend three times with similar results from 2:44 to 2:52am. These calls were investigated with the police concluding they do not believe he was involved in the crime.

The two surviving roommates had returned home by 1:00am, and were in their beds on the ground floor of the home at the time of the murders. They were not attacked or held hostage, and did not awaken until later that morning. The four victims were stabbed to death on the second and third floors in the home, where they had been sleeping. The victims were not gagged or restrained, and the walls at the scene were splattered with blood.

No calls to 911 were made until 11:58 am, many hours after the early morning killings. At that time, a call was made from inside the residence, from the cellphone of one of the surviving students who lived at the residence, asking for aid for an "unconscious" person. When police arrived, the door to the home was open, there was no sign of forced entry or damage inside the home, and nothing appeared to be missing. The two surviving roommates were in the residence when the police arrived, as were other friends of the victims, as the surviving roommates had called friends over to the home because they believed one of the second-floor victims was unconscious and was not waking up. The identity of the 911 caller was not released, and the person was not considered a suspect.

All four victims were pronounced deceased at 12:00 pm. That night, officers came upon Goncalves's dog, which she shared with Jack DuCoeur, alive and unharmed at the house; it was ultimately handed over to what police said was a 'responsible party'.

Four college students were killed: Ethan Chapin, 20, of Conway, Washington; Kaylee Goncalves, 21, of Rathdrum, Idaho; Xana Kernodle, 20, of Avondale, Arizona (later Post Falls, Idaho); and Madison "Maddie" Mogen, 21, of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. Chapin was a freshman, Kernodle was a junior, and Goncalves and Mogen were both seniors. All of the victims were also part of the university's Greek life, with Chapin a member of Sigma Chi, Goncalves a member of Alpha Phi, and Kernodle and Mogen members of Pi Beta Phi.

On Sunday night, the university canceled classes for Monday, November 14; it also scheduled a candlelight vigil to be held on the UI administration building lawn on Wednesday evening, then postponed it two weeks. Fall break was scheduled to begin after Friday, November 18, with classes resuming on Monday, November 28. Many students and other Moscow residents, not trusting the initial assurances of the police and fearing for their own safety, began an early Thanksgiving holiday exodus from the area, while others who stayed were anxious and cautious, and a number of professors canceled their classes. Because of weather concerns, the candlelight vigil was moved indoors to the Kibbie Dome and held on the evening of Wednesday, November 30.

The investigation of the murders is being conducted by the Moscow police (who had in their force four detectives and 24 patrol officers working on it), supported by the Idaho State Police (20 investigators, 15 troopers, and a Forensics Services and mobile crime scene team), the FBI (22 investigators, 20 assigned agents, and 2 Behavior Analysis Units), and the Latah County Sheriff's Office. In all, almost 130 members of law enforcement from three different agencies began working on the case. A phone tip line and email were created for students and others to submit potential evidence to officials. By December 5, it was reported that there had been more than 2,600 emailed tips, 2,700 phone calls, and 1,000 digital media submissions from the public to these tip lines.

The Latah County coroner conducted autopsies on the four victims on November 17. She said they all appeared to have been stabbed multiple times (with fatal wounds in the chest and upper body) with a large knife (if not the same knife, very similar ones). At least one victim (with what were apparently defensive stab wounds on her hands) and possibly more appear to have tried to fend off their attacker, and the victims may have been attacked while sleeping in their beds. None showed signs of sexual assault, and toxicology reports are pending. All four deaths were deemed homicide by stabbing. They were not tied and gagged. No weapon has been recovered, though the police believe the killer or killers used a fixed-blade knife. 

The police have ruled out: (a) a fellow student wearing a white hoodie seen in the video footage speaking to Mogen and Goncalves by the food truck; (b) the person who drove Mogen and Goncalves home; (c) the two surviving roommates, who were home during the killings; and (d) Goncalves's former long term boyfriend whom she and Mogen had called a total of ten times that night. The authorities left open the possibility that there could be more than one perpetrator. In a November 23 press conference, the Moscow police chief said that authorities had received a number of tips including that Goncalves allegedly had a stalker, but were unable to verify that claim or identify any such individual at that time.

On December 27th, a screengrab was posted on Reddit, showing Gonclaves and Mogen conversing with a patron at a local bar, the Corner Club, at 1:32 am on the night of the killings. Moscow Police reported that they have reviewed the footage but provided no other information. 

In the early morning hours of December 30th, authorities in Monroe County, Pennsylvania outside Stroudsburg, announced that they had taken a suspect into custody. The person, identified as 28-year-old Bryan Christopher Kohberger of Albrightsville, Pennsylvania (born November 21, 1994), was referred to as a person of interest in the investigation.

Kohberger's previous life before the massacre has not been detailed yet, but Kohberger was a former graduate at the Washington State University in Pullman, Washington, and had pursued his Ph.D. in criminal justice and criminology.

The incident has been marked by a reversal of police statements as to whether the community might be at risk, and a perceived lack of apparent progress in solving the crime. From the day of the killings, investigators initially said that there was no risk to the community. Three days later, however, Moscow Police Chief James Fry said: "We cannot say that there is no threat to the community."

Due to the slow release of details about the crime to the public, some began to speculate and spread misinformation about the case on social media. Three days after the killings, the father of Ethan Chapin spoke out about the lack of information from the University of Idaho and local police, highlighting the spread of rumors due to the silence from officials. The father of Kaylee Goncalves spoke of the lack of flow of information from police to the families of the victims about 11 days after the attack, saying: "They’re just so vague with everything that they say and then they like slowly peel it back later until you like find the real story".

Slavery in contemporary Africa

Africa has a long history of slavery. Slavery proably existed there even before there was writing. Even today, it is one of the regions affected by contemporary slavery. The slave trade intensified with the trans-Saharan and Indian Ocean slave trade and again with the trans-Atlantic slave trade; Because there was a high demand for slaves, this created a number of kingdoms in the Sahel-zone. These kingdoms were at war with each other all the time, as this was the only way to get prisoners of war, which could be turned into slaves to be exported. During the age of colonialism in Africa, in the 18th and 19th centuries,as well as the early 20th century, these patterns continued. The colonial authorities tried to stop slavery, starting from about 1900, but they were not very successful. After decolonization, slavery continued in many parts of Africa even though it is technically illegal. 

Slavery in the Sahel region and the Horn of Africa exists along racial and cultural boundaries: There are Arabized Berbers in the north, and darker Africans in the south. 

In the Sahel states of Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad and Sudan there is a concept called hereditary servitude: One family serves another family. This is passed on from the parents to the children. The pattern is centuries old, and slavery can make use of it. Other forms of slavery exist in parts of Ghana, Benin, Togo and Nigeria. Other forms of slavery in Africa involve human trafficking, the recruiting or enslavement of child soldiers and child labourers. Human trafficking occurs in Togo, and children are trafficked from Togo, Benin and Nigeria to Gabon and Cameroon. 

According to the Anti-Slavery-Society, modern day slavery in Africa means that whole groups of people are exploited, even when this is not called "slavery". 

Forced labor in Sub-Saharan Africa is estimated at 660,000. This includes people involved in the illegal diamond mines of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which is also a direct result of the civil wars in these regions. In 2017, the International Labour Office estimated that 7 in every 1,000 people in Africa are victims of slavery.

While institutional slavery has been banned worldwide, there are many reports of female sex slaves in areas without an effective government control, such as Sudan and Liberia, Sierra Leone, northern Uganda, Congo, Niger and Mauritania. In Ghana, Togo, and Benin, a form of (forced) religious prostitution known as "trokosi" ("ritual servitude") forcibly keeps thousands of girls and women in traditional shrines as "wives of the gods", where priests perform the sexual function in place of the gods.

Forced labor, which can be different from slavery, is defined as any work or services which people are forced to do against their will under the threat of some form of punishment. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the indigenous people are usually victims of their Bantu neighbors, who have replaced the positions once held by Arabs and Europeans.
The trading of children has been reported in modern Nigeria and Benin. The children are kidnapped or purchased for $20–70 each by slavers in poorer states, such as Benin and Togo, and sold into slavery in sex dens or as unpaid domestic servants for $350 each in wealthier oil-rich states, such as Nigeria and Gabon.

In April 2014, Boko Haram kidnapped 276 female students from Chibok, Borno. More than 50 of them soon escaped, but the others have not been released. Instead, the leader of Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, announced his intention of selling them into slavery. 

Ritual servitude (Trokosi) is a practice in Ghana, Togo, and Benin where traditional religious shrines take human beings, usually young virgin girls, in payment for services, or in religious atonement for alleged misdeeds of a family member—almost always a female. In Ghana and in Togo, it is practiced by the Ewe people in the Volta Region, and in Benin, it is practiced by the Fon.

Raorchestes chlorosomma

The green-eyed bush frog ("Raorchestes chlorosomma") is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it exactly one place in the Western Ghat mountains. People have seen it between 1400 and 1800 meters above sea level.

This frog lives in evergreen forests up in the mountains. These forests are called sholas. Sholas only grow in the Western Ghat mountains. People have also seen these frogs in tea farms and forests that grow back after they were cut down.

Scientists say this frog is in danger of dying out. This is because it lives in such a small place and human beings continue to change these places, especially to make farms for tea, eucalyptus, and wattle. Scientists also think climate change could hurt this frog. Because it lives high in mountains, the frog cannot move north when the weather gets hotter the way other animals could.

Scientists think the fungus "Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis" could makethis frog sick because it can make other frogs in "Raorchestes" sick, but they are not sure.

Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis (word)

Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis () is a word that was made up in 1935 by Everett M. Smith. She was the president of the National Puzzlers' League. Oxford Dictionaries says that t is the longest word in the English language. Oxford Dictionaries say that it means "an artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust".

Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is the longest word in the English language. 
The word can be split:


Everett M. Smith created the word in the daily meeting for the National Puzzlers' League (N.P.L.). "New York Herald Tribune" put the word as its title on 23 February 1935: "Puzzlers Open 103rd Session Here by Recognizing 45-Letter Word":

The word was also used in Frank Scully's puzzle book "Bedside Manna." After this the N.P.L. wanted to put the word in famous dictionaries. The Merriam-Webster dictionary put in their dictionary in 1939.

Raorchestes graminirupes

The Ponmudi bush frog ("Raorchestes graminirupes") is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it exactly one place: Palmudi in the Western Ghat mountains, between 1030 and 1300 meters above sea level.

This frog lives in grassy places and in places with low, woody plants. People have also seen it in forests, gardens, and next to roads. Scientists saw this frog sitting on plants near the ground. The female frog lays eggs in cracks in rocks or near grass. This frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog and never swims as a tadpole.

Scientists think this frog is not in danger of dying out because even though it does not live in a large place, only small parts of that place are in danger. It is also because this frog is good at living in places that human beings have changed. Scientists say this frog could be in danger if climate change changes the places it lives.

2022 Women's Africa Cup of Nations

The 2022 Women's Africa Cup of Nations (, ), also known as WAFCON 2022. They officially called it the 2022 TotalEnergies Women's Africa Cup of Nations because of sponsorship. It was the 14th time they had this tournament, and it happens every two years. Organized by Confederation of African Football (CAF), and it was held in Morocco from 2nd to 23rd July 2022.

This tournament also decided which African teams could go to the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. The top four teams got to go to the World Cup, and two more teams had a chance to get in through play-offs with teams from other parts of the world.

Before this tournament, Nigeria had won it three times in a row in 2014, 2016, and 2018. But this time, they got knocked out in the semi-finals by Morocco after a penalty shootout. It was the first time that neither Nigeria nor Equatorial Guinea made it to the final match. In the final, Morocco lost to South Africa, and that was the first time South Africa had ever won this tournament. They had tried five times before and never won it. With this win, South Africa became only the second country, after Nigeria, to win both the men's and women's competitions.

This was also the first time they had 12 teams in the tournament because the 2020 edition, which should have been the first one with 12 teams, got canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa. The semi-final between Morocco and Nigeria had a record number of people watching, with 45,562 spectators.

Morocco got into the competition because they were the hosts. The other eleven places were decided by the games that teams played to get in.

The competition took place in Casablanca and Rabat.

In the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, these teams from Africa participated, and two more teams may also get a chance to join them in the playoffs between different football regions.

B Line (Los Angeles Metro)

The B Line, named the Red Line from 1993–2020, is a rapid transit line part of the Los Angeles Metro Rail system. It opened on January 30, 1993, and was fully completed on June 24, 2000, with 14 stations. The B Line is completely underground, and it has stations in the San Fernando Valley, Central Los Angeles, and Downtown Los Angeles. The line is one of the two rapid transit lines (along with the D Line) in Los Angeles. The two lines share tracks between Downtown Los Angeles and Koreatown. 

The B Line (formally the Red Line) was part of a plan to connect Downtown Los Angeles with a rapid transit line to central and western portions of Los Angeles. Early plans in the 1980s had the line traveling west along Wilshire Boulevard and then north to the San Fernando Valley using Fairfax Avenue. Many residents who lived near the proposed line did not like the plan.

In 1985, a methane explosion occurred at a Ross Dress for Less clothing store near Fairfax Avenue. Although the explosion was unrelated to the line, the area became a "methane zone". This stopped any plan for a rapid transit line to travel on Fairfax Avenue.

Los Angeles Metro staff decided to reroute the Red Line after the incident. The line changed from traveling north on Vermont Avenue instead of Fairfax. The route on Vermont was originally going to be above ground. It was changed to underground due to complaints from nearby businesses, hospitals, and media studios in Hollywood. 
The project was built in four phases. Construction started on the first phase (MOS-1) of the Red Line on September 29, 1986. The first phase went from Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles to Westlake/MacArthur Park station. It opened on January 30, 1993. The second phase (MOS-2A) went from Westlake/MacArthur Park station to Wilshire/Western station in Koreatown. That expansion started service in 1996.

The third phase (MOS-2B) continued to extend the line from Wilshire/Vermont to the Hollywood/Vine station. However, some serious problems occurred during the construction of that phase. A sinkhole formed in the ground on Hollywood Boulevard. This nearly hurt many workers and damaged some buildings on the street. This problem stopped construction until experts could decide how to fix it. MOS-2B eventually opened in 1999.

The project's fourth phase (MOS-3) completed the rapid transit line from Hollywood/Highland to North Hollywood station. It opened on June 24, 2000. This phase required tunneling underneath the Santa Monica Mountains. Metro had plans to extend the line further, but those plans were canceled. The people of Los Angeles voted in 1998 for the city to stop using more taxes for subway tunneling. This stopped new rapid transit line construction in Los Angeles. Those plans were replaced with new light rail lines and busways. Overall, the construction of the current Red Line cost $4.5 billion. 

Once the line was complete, trains started running on two routes. Union Station to Wilshire/Western and Union Station to North Hollywood. To clarify, the trains that went to Union Station and Wilshire/Western were given a new name, the Purple Line, in 2006. In 2020, the Red Line was renamed to the B Line, and the Purple Line became the D Line.

The B Line begins service daily at 4:30 a.m. and ends around midnight. During the day, trains are scheduled to come every 12 minutes. In the early mornings and late nights, trains are scheduled to come every 20 minutes.

The rolling stock (trains) used on the B (and D) Line are called the Breda A650. Metro operates those trains with six cars during rush hours and four cars at other times. The B Line operates out of the Division 20 Yard (Santa Fe Yard). This yard also stores and gives maintenance to the trains. The yard is located east of Union Station.

The B Line stops at 14 stations from Union Station to North Hollywood. All stations are underground. The line's northern station is North Hollywood station in the San Fernando Valley. Heading towards Union Station, the line turns southeast and passes underneath the Santa Monica Mountains. When it reaches the Hollywood/Highland station, the line travels east underneath Hollywood Boulevard. At the intersection of Vermont and Hollywood, the line turns south under Vermont Avenue until it connects to the D Line's tracks at Wilshire/Vermont Station. B Line shares the same track and 6 stations with the D Line from Wilshire/Vermont to Union Station.

Majorian

Majorian (Latin: Iulius Flavius Valerius Maiorianus, c. 420 - 7 August 461) Was a Western Roman emperor from 1 April 457 - 2 August 461. Majorian was a skilled general and was probably the last hope for the survival of the crumbling Western Roman Empire as he was able to reconquer much of southern gaul and much of Hispania back under Roman Control. In 7 August 461, Majorian was deposed by a germanic roman general Ricimer and was killed.

During his reign, Majorian was able to secure several succesful campaigns in Gaul and Hispania reconquering much of both provinces and bringing it back under Roman Control. In 460 Majorian went to Hispania and ordered to build as massive fleet for preperations for an invasion of Africa, but before he was able to put his plans into action, his redied fleet was burned most of it destroyed and only leaving a few warships in a good state. After the incident, Majorian abandons his plans for a possible reconquest of Africa and instead focused on retaking Gaul and Hispania instead.

Julius Nepos

Julius Nepos (Latin: Iulius Nepos, death 9 May 480) was a Western Roman emperor from 24 June 474 28 August 475 (in Italy) and 28 August 475 9 May 480 (in Dalmatia). 

Romulus Augustus is recognised as the last ruler of the Western Roman Empire. 

After being deposed by a Roman General Orestes he retreated to Dalmatia where he continued to claim the western imperial title and was continued to be recognised by the Eastern Roman Empire until he was murdered in 480.

Gravitational redshift

In physics and general relativity, we have something called gravitational redshift. It's like this: Imagine you have light (photons), moving away from a place with very strong gravity, like a star or a black hole. As these photons move away, they look like they are losing energy. This makes them look like they have a lower frequency and longer wavelength, which we call a redshift because this moves light to the red part of the spectrum.

But, if photons move towards a place with strong gravity, like towards a star or black hole, they look like they are gaining more energy. This is called gravitational blueshift, and it's like moving light towards the blue end of the spectrum.

There are two main ways to explain gravitational redshift and blueshift. One way connects it to the equivalence principle, which says that gravity and acceleration are kinda the same thing. If you think of it this way, the redshift happens because of something called the Doppler effect.

Another way to think about it involves the concept of mass-energy equivalence (E=mc²). The basic idea is that when photons move into a stronger gravitational field, they gain energy. This gain in energy makes them look bluer. But when they move away from the gravitational field, they lose energy. This loss in energy makes them look redder.

Now, don't expect to see lots of redshift in everyday life because gravitational redshifts are very small most of the time. For example, sunlight that escapes from the Sun gets redshifted by a teeny tiny amount, and GPS signals from satellites experience a tiny blueshift. But it's still important to think about these effects for precise measurements, especially in things like GPS technology.

In astronomy, when we talk about these shifts, we often describe them as equivalent velocities. So, the sunlight redshift is like saying the light looks like it is moving away at a certain speed, but it's super tiny. The redshift is only much bigger when you look at objects with strong gravity, like black holes.

Scientists use these gravitational redshifts to test Einstein's theory of relativity and even look for dark matter. It's an interesting concept that helps us understand the effects of gravity on light and the universe around us.

Unionism in the United Kingdom

Unionism in the United Kingdom, also referred to as UK unionism or British unionism, is a political opinion. It is in support of keeping England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as one sovereign state, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The people who support the union are called ""Unionists"". Although not all unionists are nationalists, UK or British unionism is associated with British nationalism. It says that the British are a nation. It is also for the the Britons having a single culture. This cultural unity would include people of English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish, Cornish, Jersey, Manx and Guernsey descent.

E. Allen Lightner

Edwin Allan Lightner (December 7, 1907 - September 15, 1990) is US embassy official and employee of the United States Department of State. He served as Ambassador to Libya from 1963 to 1965. In 1961 while serving as assistant chief of the U.S. Mission in Berlin, Lightner was detained twice by East German border guards in October 1961 when he crossed into East Berlin to underscore the United States' determination to have unrestricted access to all occupation zones in Berlin. He also participated in the Berlin exchange of Francis Gary Powers, the American U-2 pilot shot down during a reconnaissance flight over the Soviet Union in 1960.

Lightner was born on December 7, 1907, in New York City, New York and graduated from Princeton University in 1930.

In 1930, Lightner joined the United States Department of State. He was primarily active overseas, visiting a total of 18 countries in Latin America, Europe, Africa, and Asia until his retirement in 1970. He became Assistant Director for the Central European Division from 1945 to 1947; Deputy Director of the Central European Division from 1947 to 1948; Deputy Political Director for the High Commission in Frankfurt from 1949 to 1951. He then became charge d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy in South Korea (March 1, 1951 to February 1953), Consul General in Munich from 1953 to 1956, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs from May 14, 1956 to June 1959. Lightner also became assistant chief of the U.S. Mission in West Berlin from 1960 to May 1963. While stationed in Berlin, he witnessed the construction of the Berlin Wall in August 1961. Lightner had unrestricted access to all occupied areas within the city and occasionally entered East Berlin at the direction of the American government. Lightner was detained twice by East German border guards in October 1961. 

In February 1962, he was present at the prisoner exchange at the Glienicke Bridge between American U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers, who had been captured by KGB, and Rudolf Abel, a Soviet intelligence officer who had been captured by the FBI. After the incident, Lightner became an Ambassador to Libya from May 27, 1963 to June 30, 1965. He assisted in negotiations between the United States and the Libyan government regarding the Wheelus Air Base in Tripoli, which asked what they could use for their base. 

Lightner served as vice provost for international affairs at the National Defense University from 1967 to 1970. He died of congestive heart failure on, September 15, 1990, at his home in Hancock County, Maine at the age of 82 and was buried in Section 2 of Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C..

Ayda Field

Ayda Field (birth name: Ayda Sabahat Evecan; born May 17, 1979) is an American-Turkish actress and television personality. She is married to Robbie Williams.

Field is the daughter of a Turkish father and an American Jewish mother. She became famous for her role on "Days of Our Lives". She has since acted in several films and television shows.

She is also known in the United Kingdom for her regular appearances on "Loose Women" and being a judge on "The X Factor", alongside her husband Robbie Williams.

Duane Bryers

Duane B. "Dick" Bryers (July 2, 1911 – May 30, 2012, Tucson, Arizona) was an American painter, illustrator, and sculptor. Dyers created the pinup girl Hilda. Hilda appeared in calendars from the mid-1950s to 1980s.

Unlike other pin-up grils Hilda is not slim. She looks like a normal woman. Today, models who look like Hilda are called plus-size models.

Dune Bryers had three brothers and two sisters. He spent his childhood on his parents' farm in Upper Peninsula of Michigan. When he was twelve, the family moved to Virginia, Minnesota, where he lived until 1939. He then had studios in Chicago and New York City.
After World War II he married Phyllis D. McFarland. They had a son and two daughters. From 1959 he lived on a ranch near Tucson, Arizona. In 1964 the couple divorced. He met his second wife Denise "Dee" Ray (November 3, 1924 – January 29, 2002) and lived with her in a Mexican village 90 miles from Mexico City in the early 1970s. In 1975 they left Mexico. They purchased a piece of land in Sonoita and built a house on it in 1980 that Bryers referred to as "The Mud Hut".

Dee died in 2002 and Duane Bryers returned to Tucson. He died a few weeks before his 101st birthday.

In 1937, Bryers won a cash prize with a mural showing mining history in Minnesota. He later used the money to move to New York.

In 1942 he entered the Museum of Modern Art's National War Poster Competition with his poster design "This is the Enemy" in category C "The Nature of the Enemy". The poster was featured in an article in Life magazine. During his time at the flight mechanics school of the US Army Air Force from 1943 to 1946, he earned some money with so-called "girlie art" on aircraft fuselages (nose art). For the military base newspaper, he drew posters and comic strips featuring his original character Cokey.

After his military service, Bryers mainly illustrated calendars on the theme of American frontier. Brown & Bigelow in Saint Paul, Minnesota published these calendars. In 1974 he also illustrated the book "The Bunkhouse Boys from the Lazy Daisy Ranch", the text of which was written by his second wife Dee. However, he became famous for his creation Hilda, a fun-loving, chubby pin-up girl, of whom he made about 250 drawings beginning in 1956. Hilda also appeared on Brown & Bigelow calendars. Besides the real pin-up icon Betty Page, Hilda was the most frequently pictured pin-up girl in the 1950s.

Bryers belonged to the seven-member artist group Tucson 7. In 1987 he was honored as artist of the year at the Tucson Art Festival. He also exhibited at the Prix de West at the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City, where some of his paintings are in the collection. There he was awarded the Trustees Gold Medal for Outstanding Contribution to Western Art in 1980 on the occasion of a solo exhibition. He also took part in annual exhibitions in Houston, the so-called Western Heritage Show. The Duane Bryers Studio (DBS) has been in the Tucson Museum of Art since November 2013.



Plus-size model

A plus-size model is a female model, who has a clothing size that is bigger than the size 34/36 used for women. Usually they were clothing sizes 40 to about 52.They are also called Curvy models. Some of the models criticize the naming. They want to drop the "plus" from the name, and be considered normal. Very often, they advertise clothing that normal women can actually wear. Many are also active in stock photography. Some are advertising products other than clothing, for example cosmetics or sunglasses. 

Other names used include "full-figured model", "extended-sizes model", "over-weight model", and "outsize model". Previously, the term "large size model" was also frequently used.

In the past, there were discussions about models being anorexic, or models with eating disorders and problems of drug abuse. With this in mind, many fashion designer started to use plus-size models for advertising campaigns and catwalks.

Jean-Paul Gaultier and John Galliano both used plus-size models in their Spring 2006 showings in Paris. Gaultier also used plus-size models Marquita Pring and Crystal Renn in his Spring 2011 Ready-to-Wear show. Italian plus-size fashion house Elena Mirò now regularly stages biannual prêt-à-porter shows during Milan Fashion Week. Mark Fast and William Tempest each used plus-size models during their own London Fashion Week showings for Spring 2009, and again as part of All Walks Beyond the Catwalk event held on 19 September 2009 in association with the British Fashion Council. Mark Fast also used plus-size models in Fall 2010, Fall 2011, and Spring 2012. Mr. Debonair of Beautiful You Fashion Tour uses plus-size models in shows around the world, including during the Beautiful You fashion show during New York Fashion Week 2022 which included Ms. Plus Intercontinental 2021 title holder Wendy Roach. Plus-size models became increasingly represented in high fashion after 2020 but saw a decline in early 2023 when ultrathin models made a comeback.

There are specialized model agencies focussing on plus-size models. The first of these agencies started in the 1970s. 

European magazines, including European editions of Elle and Vogue have featured plus size models on covers and in editorials.

In France, the media "ma grande taille" is dedicated to plus size industry and body positivity.

Lane Bryant began trading in the early 1900s as a producer of clothing for "Expectant Mothers and Newborn"'. By the early 1920s, Lane Bryant started selling clothing under the category 'For the Stout Women', which ranged between a 38–56 inch bustline. The earliest catalogs used illustrations to sell their products, but by the mid-1950s photographs were integrated into the catalogs as the evolution of printing technology made this option available. After a hiatus through the 1960–1980 period, Lane Bryant again began using plus-size models.

Evans, a U.K.-based retailer, was founded in 1930. Evans specializes in plus-sized clothing, lingerie, shoes and swimwear.

Max Mara started Marina Rinaldi, one of the first high-end clothing lines, for plus-size women in 1980. Marina Rinaldi started advertising in 1981. The line's campaigns were photographed by top photographers such as Richard Avedon, Patrick Demarchelier, Arthur Elgort, Greg Kadel, Peter Lindbergh, and Craig McDean, used top models and celebrities(including Carré Otis, Candice Huffine, Crystal Renn, and Kate Dillon Levin), and were featured in magazines and on billboards. The ads were also the first to use the term plus size rather than outsize in Europe.

Ergosphere

The ergosphere is a place just outside the event horizon of a black hole. Its name was given by Remo Ruffini and John Archibald Wheeler in 1971 and is gotten from the Greek word ἔργον (ergon), which means "work". It got its name because it is possible to get energy and even mass from this place.

In this place, it's impossible to stay in one place because of "frame-dragging." According to general relativity, anything that spins will twist the spacetime around it. This is frame dragging. So, near a rotating black hole, things start spin around it. For a spinning black hole, frame-dragging is so strong that to stay in one place, you'd have to move backward faster than the speed of light, which is impossible.

Now, this ergosphere isn't just a simple circle; it has a bit of a shape. It's kind of like a big, flattened ball. Think of it as an oblate spheroid, sort of like a pumpkin. At the top and bottom of the black hole, it touches the event horizon, but as you move toward the equator (the middle part), it goes out farther.

The size of this ergosphere depends on how fast the black hole is spinning. If it's spinning just a bit, the ergosphere is more round. But if the black hole is spinning very fast, the ergosphere starts looking more like a stretched pumpkin.

The edge of the ergosphere at the equator has the same size as the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole. And at the poles, it can be even smaller, like just half the Schwarzschild radius, especially for a super-fast-spinning black hole.

If something is inside the ergosphere, it can still escape from the black hole. But with more energy than when it went in. And we could get energy from it through the Penrose process. 

Rin Tin Tin

Rin Tin Tin (September 1918 – August 10, 1932) was a German Shepherd dog actor. He acted in movies from 1922 until 1931.

He was owned and trained by Lee Duncan. Duncan rescued him from a kennel in a French battlefield during World War I. His first movie appearance was as a replacement for a wolf in the 1922 silent Western "The Man from Hell's River". During his career as an actor, he appeared in 27 movies. On August 10, 1932, Rin Tin Tin died at Duncan's home in Los Angeles. When he died, it was big news with television programs being interrupted to report on it. Duncan had his body flown back to France and buried him at the Cimetière des Chiens et Autres Animaux Domestiques in Asnières-sur-Seine.

Rin Tin Tin and his mate Nanette II had 48 puppies and many of them would go on to also act under the Rin Tin Tin name.

On February 8, 1960, Rin Tin Tin was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences honored him in the documentary "Hollywood Dogs: From Rin Tin Tin to Uggie".

2022 OFC Women's Nations Cup

The 2022 OFC Women's Nations Cup, and they do it every four years. Different countries from Oceania took part in this tournament. It was the 9th time they had this competition. Originally, they were going to play the matches in July and August 2022. But they had to change the dates to January and February because of some schedule changes by the FIFA Women's International Match Calendar. Also, they had to move it because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, they decided to have the tournament in Fiji from 13th to 30th July 2022.

This tournament was a way for teams in Oceania to try to qualify for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup which was to take place in Australia and New Zealand. However, New Zealand, one of the countries in Oceania, didn't have to compete because they were hosting the World Cup, so they were automatically in.

The team from Papua New Guinea won this special tournament and became the champions. It was the first time they won the OFC Women's Nations Cup.

All the games where played in one place called the ANZ Stadium. This stadium is on an island called Viti Levu, in a town called Suva. 
On 10th May, they had an event to decide which teams will play against each other in the first part of the competition. They put the teams into different groups. This was based on how well the FIFA rankings of 25 March.

Only New Zealand got a spot to play in the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup because they are hosting the tournament together Australia. They didn't have to qualify like the other teams.

Raorchestes agasthyaensis

The Agasthya bush frog ("Raorchestes agasthyaensis") is a frog. It lives in India. Scientists have seen it between 600 and 1600 meters above sea level in the Western Ghat mountains.

This frog lives on bushes. People have seen it on and near tea farms and in evergreen forests. People have also seen it in places where people have cut down some trees but not all the trees to get wood to build with. This frog hatches out of its egg as a small frog. It never swims as a tadpole.

Some of the places this frog lives are protected parks.

2023 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)

The European qualifying competition to decide which women's football teams from Europe would go to the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand happened. There were eleven spots available for European teams to go directly to the World Cup, and one team had a chance to go through more matches in the inter-confederation play-offs.

Out of the 55 European countries that are part of UEFA, 51 of them took part in this competition. It was the first time Cyprus tried to qualify for the World Cup, and Luxembourg played in a group stage for the first time ever.

On 28 February 2022, FIFA and UEFA announced that Russia was suspended from all competitions. On 2 May 2022, UEFA announced that Russia would no longer be allowed to take part in the competition, that their previous results were nullified, and that Group E would continue with five teams.

Since some groups had six teams and others had five, matches against the sixth-placed team in the groups with six teams were not counted.
Here is a list of twelve teams from Europe (UEFA) that made it to the World Cup.

Argentina women's national football team

The Argentina women's national football team is the team that plays for Argentina in women's international football. They are called ""La Albiceleste"," which means "The White and Sky-Blues." In Argentina, women's football is not as popular as men's football. More people follow sports like field hockey and volleyball. Most of the women who played football in Argentina used to do it just for fun until 1991 when they started a women's football championship called the Campeonato de Fútbol Femenino. This was done to make women's football more popular in Argentina.

When it comes to football matches between Argentina and Brazil, it's not the same as the men's matches. Brazil usually does better because they have a strong women's football league that has been around for a long time, while Argentina only started their professional women's league in 2019.

Colombia women's national football team

The Colombia women's football team is the team that plays for Colombia in women's international football. They play in international competitions and are managed by the Colombian Football Federation. They are part of CONMEBOL, which is a group of South American football teams. Right now, they are ranked 28th in the FIFA Ranking. They have played in three FIFA Women's World Cups: in Germany in 2011, Canada in 2015, and Australia–New Zealand in 2023.

Colombia is one of the best national teams in South America. They are the third country on the continent to qualify for both the World Cup and the Olympics, after Brazil and Argentina. In 2015, they were the first Spanish-speaking country to win a game in the Women's World Cup and the first whose women's team got past the group stage in 2015.

Las Cafeteras, as they are sometimes called, have been in every Copa América Femenina tournament since 1998. They finished second in 2010, 2014, and 2022.

Denmark women's national football team

The Denmark women's national football team plays football for Denmark and Greenland. They are in charge of the Danish Football Association (DBU). They take part in different football competitions like the FIFA Women's World Cup, UEFA Women's Euro, the Summer Olympics, and the Algarve Cup. Denmark has been to the FIFA Women's World Cup four times and the UEFA Women's Championship nine times. They made it to the final of the UEFA Women's Euro in 2017.

During the UEFA Women's Euro in 2017, Denmark was in a group with the Netherlands, Norway, and Belgium. They won against Belgium and Norway by a score of 1-0 each, but they lost to the Netherlands with a score of 1-0. Even though they didn't finish first in their group, they still got to the quarter-finals where they played against Germany. Surprisingly, Denmark won against the team that had been the champions of Europe for 22 years with a score of 2-1. After that, they reached the semi-finals. In the semi-finals, they played against Austria, and the match ended with no goals, so they had to decide the winner with a penalty shootout, which Denmark won 3-0. This was the first time they reached the final. In the final match, they played against the Netherlands in Enschede, in front of a crowd of 28,182 people. However, the Danish team lost 4-2 to the Netherlands, who won their first UEFA Euro title.

In March 2007, Denmark was ranked sixth in the FIFA Women's World Rankings, which was their highest ranking ever. Their lowest ranking was 20th place in June 2016.

Italy women's national football team

The Italy women's national football team () is a women's football team for Italy, has been playing football internationally since 1968. The team is managed by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC).

Apparent weight

Apparent weight is the weight that an object seems to have on a scale or when supported by a surface. It is not the same as the actual weight of the object, which is determined by the force of gravity. Apparent weight can change depending on the situation. For example, if you are in an elevator that is moving up or down, your apparent weight will be different from your actual weight. This is because the elevator is accelerating, which means it is changing its speed or direction. When the elevator accelerates, it creates an additional force on you that either adds to or subtracts from the force of gravity. This changes the normal force, which is the force that the surface exerts on you to balance the force of gravity. The normal force is what you feel as your apparent weight.

An at-large constituency is a single constituency that represents an entire region, generally one with a lower population relative to other regions.

Australia no longer uses at-large electorates (called divisions) to elect the House of Representatives. Under the Constitution, each state has to have at least five seats in the House of Representatives and 12 seats in the Senate. However, this does not include the territories, which currently have two Senate seats each and between two and three House seats each (the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) has three while the Northern Territory has two). At certain points in time, the two territories had one at-large division each.

From 1949 until 1974, the ACT was represented by one division: the Division of Australian Capital Territory. It was then split into two divisions: Canberra and Fraser (named after Jim Fraser). A third division, Namadgi, was created in 1996 but abolished in 1998. In 2016, Fraser was abolished and a new Melbourne-based seat called Fraser was created in honour of Malcolm Fraser. The old seat of Fraser was replaced by Fenner. A third division was created again in 2019, this time named Bean. Currently, there are three divisions: Bean (which includes most of the ACT's land area, including the southern suburbs of Canberra and some smaller towns, as well as the overseas territory of Norfolk Island), Canberra (which includes the inner and eastern suburbs of Canberra]]) and Fenner (which includes the northern and western suburbs of Canberra, as well as the Jervis Bay Territory).

From 1922 until 2001, the Northern Territory was represented by only one division: the Division of Northern Territory. In 2001, it was split into two divisions: Lingiari (covering the majority of the Northern Territory's land area, as well as the overseas territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands) and Solomon (covering the majority of the Northern Territory's population, including its two largest cities: Darwin and Palmerston).

The Canadian House of Commons electoral districts of Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon are considered at-large because they represent the entire territories of the same name, respectively.

Most European Parliament constituencies represent an entire country and are therefore at-large.

Several congressional districts of the House of Representatives of the Philippines are at-large.

Of the 435 voting members of the United States House of Representatives, there are currently six that are elected from at-large congressional districts, as well as all six non-voting delegates.



Leo II (emperor)

Leo II (Greek: Λέων, c. 467 - November 474) Was an Eastern Roman emperor from 17 November 473 - November 474. He was the son of future emperor Zeno and emperor Leo I daughter Ariadne. Leo II ruled the empire along with his grandfather Leo I and he later became the sole ruler after Leo I died.

As the grandson of Leo I, Leo II had a strong claim to succeed his throne. Leo I, who was becoming increasingly ill, felt obligated to declare a successor to the imperial throne, but passed over his son-in-law due to his unpopularity. Instead, Leo II was made "caesar" by Leo I around October 472, and was later promoted to "augustus" in November 473, making him co-emperor alongside his grandfather.

2022–23 UEFA Europa League group stage

The 2022–23 UEFA Europa League group stage started on 8th September 2022 and finished on 3rd November 2022. In this stage, 32 teams played to figure out which 16 teams would move on to the next round of the 2022–23 UEFA Europa League.

Teams like Bodø/Glimt, Nantes, Union Berlin, and Union Saint-Gilloise were taking part in the Europa League group stage for the first time. Union Saint-Gilloise was appearing in a UEFA competition group stage for the first time ever.

Teams from 23 different countries were part of the group stage.

The drawing to decide the groups happened on 26th August 2022 in Istanbul, Turkey. There were 32 teams, and they were split into eight groups, each containing four teams. To make it fair, the teams were separated into four pots, each pot having eight teams. This separation was based on how well the teams did in the 2022 UEFA club rankings. Teams from the same country couldn't end up in the same group. Before the drawing, UEFA matched up teams from the same country and decided which groups they would go in. This was done to make sure that these teams had different starting times for their matches. They did this based on which teams had more people watching on TV.

After they knew which teams were in the group stage, UEFA told us which teams were matched up from the same country. This was important because it affected when these teams played their matches.

Notes

The fixtures were announced on 27 August 2022, the day after the draw. The matches were played on 8 September, 15 September, 6 October, 13 October, 27 October and 3 November 2022. The scheduled kick-off times were 18:45 and 21:00 CET/CEST.

Times are CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).

Toyota Century

The Toyota Century was a sedan that was built between the 1960s and the 1990s.

The Toyota century had a very good look in black but offers a good built quality and safety. It compares with the old Mercedes S-class and the old BMW 7 series it also compares with the old Audi A8.Coming back to the new SUV version of the Toyota century, it's main feature is the luxury and the fact that it is very special like the Rolls Royce Culianan. Toyota said that there will be a convertible version of this Toyota century. The main reason Toyota has done all this because they have noticed that so many people liked the old one and for a change It's now a SUV which makes it more practical for the luxury that the passengers get along with the luggage space provided. And because of their enthusiasm they gave a option for a convertible so people can enjoy the sun on top their head whenever they would like to.

Baker Street robbery

The Baker Street robbery was a crime for burglary on safety deposit boxes in London, England on Baker Street. It happened at Lloyds Bank.

Heating element

A heating element is a basic part of many electrical appliances and systems that create and maintain heat. They are needed for a wide range of uses. These include appliances for home use such as ovens and water heaters and industrial machinery and laboratory equipment.

Heating elements are usually made using materials that have a high electrical resistance. Examples include nichrome (a nickel-chromium alloy), Kanthal (an iron-chromium-aluminum alloy), or other alloys made for heat generation. When an electric current flows through the heating element, the resistance makes it heat up. It converts electrical energy into thermal energy. This idea of heating using resistance is the main way heating elements work

The choice of heating element depends on factors like the required temperature range, heat distribution, durability and power consumption. 

Heating elements play a important role in modern technology and industry. They supply the comfort, convenience and efficiency of various everyday appliances and processes.

Gravitational collapse

Gravitational collapse is a process where an object in space, like a star or cloud of gas, shrinks down because of its own very strong gravity. This gravity pulls everything closer to its center.

This plays a very important role in our universe. For example, you might have a cloud of things like stars or galaxies in space all over the place. But soon, gravity starts to bring everything together. This process forms all kinds of structures, like galaxy clusters, star clusters, stars, and even planets.

For example, a star is born when a huge cloud of interstellar gas slowly comes together because of gravity. As this continues to happen, the pressure and temperature inside the cloud increases. Soon, the temperature and pressure becomes so much that they thermonuclear fusion starts.

When fusion starts, the star releases light and heat, and the energy it makes pushes outward, trying to stop gravity from crushing the star. This keeps the star stable.

But eventually, the star would run out of fuel and gravity will win. It will do another gravitational collapse and turn into something new. Depending on how heavy the star was, it could become a white dwarf, neutron star, or, if it was heavy enough, a black hole.

So, gravitational collapse is a fundamental process in the universe that help creates the structures we see, including the stars that light up our night sky.

I'm Not Human

"I'm Not Human" is a song by American rappers XXXTentacion and Lil Uzi Vert. The song was released on January 23, 2023, which would have been X's 25th birthday.

The song was able to make it to #21 on RMNZ's Hot Singles Chart.

During a Q&A on Adin Ross's livestream, Uzi said that they were going to work on a song with X and that they got a phone call from X while X was in prison where he rapped a song to them. Uzi was asked how it felt to work on a song after X's murder, they said "I'd love to do a song with [X], but I'm really weird on stuff like that. Don’t get me wrong, it took me really long to do that with another artist. I'm really weird because I understand that they're not here living and what if that's not the vision they really want? Especially if they really fucked with me. What if that's all wrong, I'd be pissed off if like they did it all wrong and I'm not here. But you know, if it works out, it works out."

In the song, X sings about he doesn't feel like he fits in, feels empty inside and doesn't feel basic human emotion. He says that his girlfriend can tell him her emotions because he is already broken and can handle it. Uzi sings about how they want to find a place to fit in and that are tired of the World insulting them.

When it was first uploaded, X had an interpolation of the song "Snuff" by Slipknot but it was later removed and re-uploaded with it because they didn't get the clearance to it.

Ceramic sintering

Ceramic sintering is the process of compacting and forming a solid mass of material by pressure or heat without melting it to the point of liquefaction. Sintering occurs as part of a manufacturing process used with metals, ceramics, plastics and other materials. Nanoparticles in the sintered material diffuse across the particle boundaries, fusing them together and creating a solid piece.

Ceramic sintering is part of the firing process used in the manufacture of ceramics and other ceramic objects. Sintering and vitrification (which requires higher temperatures) are the two main mechanisms behind the strength and stability of ceramics. Sintered ceramic objects are made of substances such as glass, alumina, zirconium, silica, magnesia, lime, beryllium oxide, and ferric oxide . Some ceramic raw materials have a lower affinity for water and a lower plasticity index than clay, requiring organic additives in the stages prior to sintering.

Sintering begins when sufficient temperatures have been reached to mobilize the active elements in the ceramic material, which may begin below its melting point (typically 50–80% of its melting point),

The Australian Football League (AFL) funds the tournament. In 2023, the AFL confirmed that it would be funding regional tournaments for teams affiliated with the AFL, beginning in 2024. The three tournaments will be the Asia Cup (for Asian countries), the Pacific Cup (for Oceanian countries and South Africa) and the Trans-Atlantic Cup (for European countries, Canada, Colombia and the United States).

Storm Daniel

Storm Daniel also known as Cyclone Daniel, was a Mediterranean tropical like cyclone that affected southeastern Europe. It was the deadliest and costliest Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone ever recorded as well as the deadliest cyclone worldwide since Cyclone Nargis in 2008. It was also the deadliest weather event of 2023 as of September 2023. Atleast 6,850 have been confirmed death while around 10,000-1,000,000 are reportedly missing. Most of these fatalities occured in Libya.

Beginning to take shape around September 4, 2023, this weather system formed as a low-pressure system. It had far-reaching effects, causing extensive flooding in Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey. As time passed, this system transformed into a Mediterranean low, officially named Storm Daniel. Soon, it developed quasi-tropical characteristics (TLC) and moved towards the Libyan coast. There, it unleashed catastrophic flooding before weakening into a remnant low. This storm's formation was a consequence of an omega block, where a high-pressure zone became sandwiched between two low-pressure zones, forming a weather pattern resembling the Greek letter Ω.

Chicken wing

Chicken wings, often referred to simply as "wings," are a dish in the world of cuisine. These have become a staple of menus in restaurants, bars, and households worldwide. Known for their versatility, chicken wings are prepared in a variety of flavors and cooking styles, making them a favorite for gatherings and social events. The origins of chicken wings can be traced back to the United States, specifically Buffalo, New York, in the 1960s. The original creation of Buffalo wings is credited to Teressa Bellissimo at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo in 1964. Legend has it that she created this dish to satisfy a late-night snack craving by deep-frying leftover chicken wings and tossing them in a buttery hot sauce. The concept quickly gained popularity and became a local sensation.

Chicken wings are typically divided into two sections: the drumette and the flat or wingette. They are prepared by deep-frying, baking, or grilling, with deep-frying being the most common method. One of the defining characteristics of chicken wings is the wide range of sauces and flavors in which they can be coated. Popular choices include buffalo sauce, honey barbecue, teriyaki, garlic Parmesan, and lemon pepper. These sauces can vary in spiciness and sweetness, catering to a diverse range of taste preferences. Chicken wings are often served with celery sticks and carrot sticks as a contrast to their spicy or savory flavors. They are frequently accompanied by a side of ranch or blue cheese dressing for dipping. Chicken wings are commonly served as an appetizer or a main course, and their versatility allows them to be part of casual gatherings, sports events, or even fine dining experiences.

Jacques Biélinky

Jacques Biélinky ( – 1943) was a Russian-born French Jewish journalist and art critic.

Jacques Biélinky was born into a Russian-born Jewish family. He survived a Russian Holocaust-like event, called the Kishinev pogrom in 1903. After the event ended, Biélinky was arrested and was charged with socialism. He was released. Biélinky emigrated to France in 1909 as a political refugee and in 1927 he got French citizenship. Biélinky was a journalist and art critic for "The Israelite Universe". Jacques Biélinky was considered as one of the best connoisseurs to be Jewish.

In May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded France. France surrendered one month later to Nazi Germany, and they began occupying France. 

Between 1940 and 1942, Biélinky kept a diary detailing daily life in Paris, and the persecution of the Jews. In the first months of the occupation, he noticed extremely few anti-Semitic allusions. On 27 September 1940, the Nazi German government of France ordered that a poster with a yellow star should be hanged up on the walls of any store that is operated by Jewish people. Yet people still could continue enter and buy stuff from those stores.
Biélinky noticed that the support of the Parisians were fading away. Because the Jews there had supply difficulties and daily problems, most of them stopped communicating with non-Jews. Biélinky mainly wrote about the situation of his daily life as a Jew in Paris. For unknown reasons, after the last entry, he stopped writing his diary for almost two months.

Biélinky was arrested on the night of 10–11 February 1943, during a razzia by the French police and was deported to the Drancy internment camp.
One month later on 23 March 1943, he was deported from Drancy to the Chełm Ghetto in German-occupied Poland (modern-day Poland). Later that year, Biélinky was deported to the Sobibor extermination camp. He most likely died that same year. Biélinky was 61–62 years old when he died.

After World War II ended, Biélinky's diary was published posthumously as "Journal 1940–1942. Un journaliste juif à Paris sous l'Occupation." (English: "Diary 1940–1942. A Jewish journalist in Paris during the Occupation".) in 1993.

Arcadius

Arcadius (Greek: Ἀρκάδιος, c. 377 - 1 May 408) Was a Eastern Roman emperor from 16 January 383 - 1 May 408. He was the eldest son of Emperor Theodosius I, Arcadius ruled the Eastern Empire while his brother Honorius ruled the West. Just like his brother Honorius, He also proved to be a weak emperor as he was dominated by powerful ministers and including his wife Aelia Flaccila.

The first crisis Arcadius had to face was the rebellion of the Visigoths in 395, under the command of Alaric I, who sought to take advantage of the accession of two inexperienced Roman emperors. As Alaric marched towards Constantinople, plundering Macedonia and Thrace, the eastern court could offer no response, as the majority of its army had gone to Italy with Theodosius and was now in the hands of Stilicho. Perhaps sensing an opportunity to exercise power in the eastern half of the empire as well, Stilicho declared that Theodosius had made him guardian over both his sons.

Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden

On September 12, 2023, Kevin McCarthy, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, announced an impeachment inquiry into president Joe Biden. 

Three committes will run the investigation: the House Judiciary Committee, the House Oversight Committee, and the House Ways and Means Committee. James Comer, chairman of the Oversight committee, will lead the investigation.

On September 1, 2023, McCarthy promised in an interview with "Breitbart News" that he would hold a floor vote on opening an impeachment inquiry into President Biden.

The inquiry happened even though the U.S. House investigation into Biden and some family members, had not found evidence of wrongdoing by the president.

McCarthy started the impeachment inquiry to because the far-right-wing members of the House's narrow Republican majority said they would vote him out as speaker if he did not.

On December 13, 2023, the House of Representatives voted 221–212 to create an official impeachment inquiry against Biden related to the business deals of his son, Hunter.

Biden said that he was not focused on the impeachment inquiry. He said that the Republicans "want to impeach me because they want to shut down the government". 

House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries promised to defend Biden "until the very end" and said that the impeachment inquiry was almost like a kangaroo court.

Ýdalir

In Norse mythology, Ýdalir ("yew-dales") is a place where the god Ullr lives. This information comes from the Poetic Edda, a collection of old Norse stories and poems written down in the 13th century. Scholars have different ideas about what Ýdalir might mean in the mythology.

Ýdalir is mentioned only in stanza 5 of the poem "Grímnismál", found in the "Poetic Edda". In this stanza, Odin (disguised as "Grímnir") informs young Agnar that Ullr has a home in Ýdalir. Here's a translation of the stanza ("Ýdalir" is translated as "Ydalir"):

Talking about Ýdalir, Henry Adams Bellows says that "the wood of the yew-tree was used for bows in the North just as it was long afterwards for England". Rudolf Simek also says that "this connexion of the god with the yew-tree, of whose wood bows were made, has led to Ullr being seen as a bow-god". Andy Orchard suggests that Ýdalir is a fitting home for the archer-god, Ull. Hilda Ellis Davidson mentions that while Valhalla is well-known in Norse mythology for its association with warfare and death, the significance of other halls like Ýdalir and the goddess Freyja's afterlife realm, Fólkvangr, has been largely forgotten.

Udale in Cromarty, Scotland, was first recorded in 1578, which is believed to have its roots in the Old Norse word "y-dalr".
