Universal Studios had held the production rights to "Flash Gordon" but allowed them to lapse. Former Universal executives Edward Gruskin and Matty Fox struck a deal with Flash Gordon owners King Features Syndicate to produce the first 26 episodes of the series. The series was produced by Gruskin and Wenzel Lüdecke. Writers for "Flash Gordon" included Gruskin, Bruce Geller and Earl Markham. Episodes were directed by Wallace Worsley, Jr. and Gunther von Fritsch.

Production began in May 1953, with an empty beer hall in Spandau as the main shooting location. Only the lead actors and director Worsley spoke English. Worsley said: "No matter what galaxy we explored, everyone spoke with a German accent. The use of German actors who could not speak English required us to use a lot of close-ups. I would stand behind the camera, correctly positioned for the actor's look, and read his or her line; the actor would then repeat the line, mimicking my pronunciation and emphasis."

The series was budgeted at USD$15,000 per episode on a three-day-per-episode shooting schedule. Worsley withdrew from the project after completing the first 26 episodes. Production was moved to Marseille under the direction of Gunther von Fritsch for the 13 final episodes.

List of governors of Pennsylvania

The Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is the head of the executive branch of Pennsylvania's government and the commander-in-chief of the state's military.

The job of the governor is to enforce state laws and to approve or veto bills passed by the Pennsylvania Legislature. The governor may grant pardons except in cases of impeachment.

There have been seven presidents and 46 governors of Pennsylvania. Two governors serving non-consecutive terms. There have been a total of 55 terms in both offices. The longest term was that of the first governor, Thomas Mifflin. He served three full terms as governor and two years as president. The shortest term belonged to John Bell. He served only 19 days as acting governor after Edward Martin resigned. The current governor is Josh Shapiro. His term began on January 17, 2023.

Pennsylvania was one of the first thirteen colonies. It became a state on December 12, 1787. 

The first constitution in 1776 created the Supreme Executive Council as the executive branch. The President was the leader of the Council. The president was picked each year by the council.

The 1776 constitution created the position of "vice-president" but it did not say what should happen if the president left office. This happened four times. Sources from that time still listed the chief executive as the vice president when that person acted as the president. One acting president, George Bryan, has since been recognized as a governor. This is because he acted as president for over six months.

The 1790 constitution ended the council. It replaced the president with a governor, and created a three-year term for governor. This term started on the third Tuesday of the December after the election. A governors could not serve more than nine out of any twelve years. The 1838 constitution moved the start of the term to the third Tuesday of the January after the election. It allowed governors to only serve six out of any nine years. The 1874 constitution lengthened the term to four years. It said that governors could not succeed themselves (be elected to another term while still in office). The current constitution of 1968 changed this to allow governors to serve two consecutive terms. There are no limits on the number of terms a governor may serve in total as long as there is a four year break after a second term.

If the governor dies, resigns or is impeached, the lieutenant governor becomes governor for the rest of the term. If the governor becomes unable to act as governor because of disability, the lieutenant governor only acts out the duties of governor. Should both offices be vacant, the president "pro tempore" of the state senate becomes governor. The position of lieutenant governor was created in the 1874 constitution. Before this, the speaker of the senate would act as governor in cases of vacancy. At first, the lieutenant governor could only act as governor. It was not until the 1968 constitution that the lieutenant governor could actually become governor. The office of governor has been vacant for an extended period of time once. There was a 17-day time period in 1848 between the death of Francis R. Shunk and the swearing in of William F. Johnston. Governors and lieutenant governors are elected on the same ticket.

, five former governors are alive. The most recent death of a former governor was that of Dick Thornburgh (1979–1987), on December 31, 2020.

Milliarium

A Milliarium (plural milliaria) was a stone that was placed alongside Roman roads. Such stones were used from about the 3rd century BC. They marked the distance between two towns, and were placed at intervals of one Roman mile. This was about 1000 milia passum, or . In the celtic provinces, leagues are often used, these are 1500 milia passum, or about .

Very often the stones condain the following information:
Even if they look like modern road signs showing the distance to given places, this was probably not the first function of these stone pillars. What seems more likely is that they were used to show the power of the person who erected them; some were probably used for propaganda. Very often, the inscription of the emperor was in Latin, but the inscription of the distance was in Greek. The ordinary population could probably read the second part, but not the first. Today between 7.000 and 8.000 such stones are known. 

Mount Pico

Mount Pico () is a composite volcano (or stratovolcano); it is the highest point of the Portuguese island of Pico in the Azores. With an altitude of above sea level, it is more than twice the elevation of any other peak in the Azores, and the tallest mountain in Portugal.

Mount Pico is at the eastern end of Pico Island. On the top of the mountain, there is round crater about in diameter and deep. Inside this crater () there is a small elevation produced by a recent, in geological terms, eruption that is known with the name of Pico Pequeno or Piquinho, which is about high. From the base of Pico Pequeno, volcanic smoke gets out with a strong odor of sulfur.

In winter, the top of the mountain is covered with snow. Rains are frequent the whole year.

Mount Pico was made a "Natural Reserve" in 1982 to protect the mountain. The reserve () has an area of about 1,500 hectares (15 km) and is from about high to the top of the mountain.

There are trails for hiking and it is possible, for persons in good conditions and depending on weather, to get to the top of the mountain in around two to four hours from the beginning of the trail.

In the lower part of its slopes is the "Paisagem da Cultura da Vinha da Ilha do Pico" ("Landscape of the Pico Island Vineyard Culture"), classified by UNESCO as a World Heritage.

Mario Party DS

Mario Party DS is a party board video game for the Nintendo DS. It is part of the "Mario Party" series of video games. It was released in Japan on November 8, 2007, in North America on November 19, 2007, and in Europe on November 23, 2007.

"Mario Party DS" features the same gameplay seen in previous "Mario Party" games. Players go around on boards to collect coins, which they can use to buy stars. Movement is done with the use of a dice block with the numbers one through ten. After all four players take their turns, a mini-game is played. The player who wins the mini-game wins coins. The winner is the player with the most stars at the end of the game. While most mini-games use the buttons and control pad, others use the console's stylus and microphone.

Five boards are in the game. Each board is themed around a character in the game. Eight characters are available for players to play as.

There are less than 70 minigames in "Mario Party DS". This paragraph will name them all:

Mario Party 8

Mario Party 8 is a party board video game for the Nintendo Wii. It is the eighth game in the "Mario Party" series of video games. It is the first "Mario Party" game for the Wii. It was released in North America on May 29, 2007, in Europe on June 22, 2007, and in Japan on July 26, 2007. The game was delayed in the United Kingdom after a slur was found in the game.

"Mario Party 8" plays the same as previous games in the "Mario Party" series. Players go around on boards to collect coins, which they can use to buy stars. Movement is done with the use of a dice block with the numbers one through ten. After all four players take their turns, a mini-game is played. The player who wins the mini-game wins coins. The winner is the player with the most stars at the end of the game. Gameplay is done with the Wii Remote.

Six boards are in the game. While some boards have players get stars the same way as in previous "Mario Party" games, others have different ways. For example, in "Koopa's Tycoon Town," players get stars by putting coins into hotels (like "Monopoly"). The hotels give stars to the player with the most coins in them. Fourteen characters are available for players to play as. Two characters, Blooper and Hammer Bro, make their first playable appearances in this game.

"Mario Party 8" was developed by Hudson Soft, like all of the other "Mario Party" games. It was announced in September 2006 as one of several games that Nintendo was going to release for the upcoming Nintendo Wii. The game was later shown off as a demo at E3 2006. The demo only included six minigames.

The game's launch in the United Kingdom had a lot of problems. The game was scheduled to release on June 22, 2007, but Nintendo delayed the British version to July 13, 2007 because of a "production issue". When the game released on July 13, it was then immediately recalled, which means it was removed from stores. In a press release, Nintendo said that the game was recalled because of an assembly error, but some retailers said that it was supposedly recalled because some copies had the word "spastic" in them. The word "spastic" is considered a very offensive slur against disabled people in British English. Ubisoft had recalled the PSP game "Mind Quiz" one month earlier because of the same word. The game was eventually re-released in the United Kingdom on August 3, 2007, with a different word used instead. Nintendo said that the price of the game would be the same and the number of copies available would not be affected.

Mario Party 7

Mario Party 7 is a party board video game for the Nintendo GameCube game console. It is the seventh game in the "Mario Party" series. It is the last "Mario Party" game for the Nintendo GameCube. It was released in North America on November 7, 2005, in Japan on November 10, 2005, and in Europe on February 10, 2006.

"Mario Party 7" plays the same as previous games in the "Mario Party" series. Players go around on boards to collect coins, which they can use to buy stars. Movement is done with the use of a dice block with the numbers one through ten. After all four players take their turns, a mini-game is played. The player who wins the mini-game wins coins. The winner is the player with the most stars at the end of the game. A new feature in this game is "Bowser Time". Every turn, a meter shaped like Bowser's face fills up a little bit. After every fifth turn, the meter fills up completely, and Bowser will appear to do something bad. What he does depends on the board.

Six boards are in the game. The last one has to be unlocked through Solo Made. Twelve characters are available for players to play as. Two of them, Birdo and Dry Bones, make their first playable appearances in this game.

Wild haggis

Wild haggis ("Haggis scoticus") is a real creature. It is said that it is native to the Scottish Highlands. It is actually said to be the source of haggis. They are quite large and have several toes. They must feed.

"Haggis scoticus" is classified within the family "Haggidae", a group of mammals exclusive to the Scottish Highlands. Genetic analyses suggest that the Wild Haggis diverged from its closest relatives in the late Pleistocene, adapting to the specific ecological niches of its highland habitat.

The Wild Haggis is renowned for its unusual anatomy, which is perfectly adapted to the steep slopes of its mountainous environment. Adults typically measure between 5 to 20 meters in length, with a dense moldy fur coat that provides insulation against the harsh Scottish weather.

The most striking feature of the Haggis is its asymmetric legs, with one side being significantly shorter than the other. This adaptation allows it to navigate the steep slopes of its habitat with remarkable agility. There are two subspecies, each with legs shorter on the opposite side, facilitating clockwise or counter-clockwise navigation around mountains. This unique characteristic has long intrigued scientists, providing insights into evolutionary adaptations.

"Haggis scoticus" is found exclusively in the Scottish Highlands, where it prefers open moorland and mountainous terrain. The distribution of the two subspecies is closely tied to the topography of their habitat, with each adapted to either the eastern or western highlands, depending on the prevalent slope direction.

Wild Haggis are solitary creatures, with a diet primarily consisting of roots, leaves, and small insects. They are most active during dawn and dusk, employing their keen sense of smell to locate food. The mating season in early spring leads to elaborate courtship displays, involving a series of vocalizations and a display of agility, showcasing their ability to navigate the terrain.

The conservation status of the Wild Haggis is currently classified as "Least Concern" by the Scottish Wildlife Trust. However, there are ongoing concerns about habitat loss and the impact of climate change on their mountainous ecosystems. Conservation efforts focus on habitat preservation and public education about the species and its importance in Scottish natural heritage.

The Wild Haggis holds a special place in Scottish culture, symbolizing the rugged beauty and mystery of the Highlands. It is celebrated annually on Burns Night, where the traditional dish of haggis is served, paying homage to the legendary creature. The Wild Haggis also features prominently in Scottish folklore, often depicted as a cunning creature, elusive and enigmatic.

The unique evolutionary adaptations of the Wild Haggis continue to attract scientific interest. Ongoing research focuses on its ecological role, genetic diversity, and the potential impact of environmental changes on its populations. "Haggis scoticus" serves as a fascinating case study in evolutionary biology and conservation science, illustrating the complex interplay between species and their environments.

Babes in Arms

Babes in Arms is a 1939 musical movie starring Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney. It was directed by Busby Berkeley. The movie is about the children of vaudeville performers who want to prove to their elders that they can sing and dance on Broadway.

It is based on the 1937 Broadway musical of the same name by Richard Rodgers and Moss Hart. Most of the original music was cut for the movie. The song "Good Morning" by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown was written for the movie and was later featured in the Gene Kelly movie "Singin' in the Rain". A new finale called "God's Country" was prepared for the movie.

Garland and Rooney parodied Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor in a segment called "My Day". The segment was removed when Roosevelt died in 1945. "Babes in Arms" was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Actor in a Leading Role (Mickey Rooney) and Best Music, Scoring (Roger Edens and Georgie Stoll).

Lafayette, Louisiana

Lafayette is the most populous city in the Acadiana region, it is the fourth most populous city in the state of Louisiana (after New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Shreveport). The original name was Vermilionville, as which it was founded around 1821. The name "Lafayette" comes from the name of a French military hero who fought with and helped the American Army during the American Revolutionary War. In 2020 the population was over one hundred and twenty thousand. The city lies in Lafayette Parish.

Comedy hip hop

Comedy hip hop (or Comedy rap) is a musical genre that combines hip hop music with comedy. While gangsta rap came with its dark and violent themes in the 1990s, comedy rap came with its very light and very humorous themes in the 1980s. While very few rappers make comedy rap their focus, it still keeps its royalties with hip hop.


Electric violin

An electric violin is a string instrument which is played with a bow, like a normal violin. The strings are usually tuned to the notes G, D, A, and E, but it could have its pitches changed as it is electric. It is held between the left collar bone (near the shoulder) and the chin. Different notes are made by fingering with the left hand while bowing with the right. It has no frets or other markers. Players have to learn the exact place to put the fingers of the left hand and memorise them. Luthiers tend to fix electric violins as well.
The modern electric violin is about 10 years old. Similar string instruments have been around for almost 1,000 years. It became the most enjoyable electric instrument played along with the electric bass. It is used as a solo instrument, in rock and sometimes blues. It is also used in folk music.

An electric violin is normally not in the shape of a normal violin, but in wacky shapes and colours.

Navi Mumbai

Navi Mumbai is a planned satellite city of Mumbai, on the west coast of Maharashtra in India. It was developed in 1972 as a new urban township of Mumbai, and is currently the largest planned city in the world.

Navi Mumbai, in the eastern harbour of Mumbai, is one of the world's largest planned townships. Since independence, there was a specific reason to build a new city on the mainland across the harbour: to lower the population of Mumbai, an island city whose physical expansion had a limit. It was regarded as an alternative for the many people who wanted to come to Mumbai from all over India. This decision required the Maharashtra government to relocate its seat of governance along with all its important offices to this new city, and completely stop the backbay reclamation project in the island city. It did not do this. It continued with the reclamation and put brakes on the efforts of CIDCO (such as the shifting of wholesale markets).

Planning of Navi Mumbai did not fully begin until 1971. South Navi Mumbai is being quickly developed with modern infrastructure in parts of Kharghar, Kamothe, New Panvel and Kalamboli.

The City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) was formed on 17 March 1971, under the Indian Companies Act, 1956. The area covered of the total of the Konkan coast. Privately owned land with 86 villages covering within the present limits of Navi Mumbai and further villages measuring an additional were acquired by the government of Maharashtra.

CIDCO carved out 16 nodes small townships with a view towards facilitating comprehensive development. These nodes are named Airoli, Ghansoli, Kopar Khairane, Juhu Nagar, Vashi, Turbhe, Sanpada, Nerul, CBD Belapur, Kharghar, Kamothe, New Panvel, Taloja, Kalamboli, Ulwe, and Dronagiri. CIDCO acquired of land, of which was private land, salt-pan land and government land. By 2000, CIDCO had developed about of land. Of this land, is saleable under various land uses. CIDCO has sold about leaving a balance land for sale about under various land uses.

CIDCO planned and constructed all the railway stations in Navi Mumbai and developed nearby areas commercially.
In 1973, the Vashi bridge was opened to the public for residents of Vashi, CBD Belapur and Nerul. The Sion-Panvel Expressway was built to reduce the time taken to travel from Sion to Panvel. Initially there was not much response to the new city. Major changes took place only after 1990, with the commissioning of a wholesale agricultural produce market at Vashi and the construction of a commuter railway line from Mankhurd to Vashi in May 1992. These developments caused a sudden growth in economic activities and population in Navi Mumbai.

By the end of the 1990s, the planning authority of Navi Mumbai started private participation in the developmental activity of Navi Mumbai.

A new railway line between Nerul and Uran was opened on 12 Jan 2024 by Shri Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India. Kharghar and Panvel are experiencing major infrastructural developments due to their being close to the proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport.

When Navi Mumbai was created in 1970s, CIDCO was the only authority that looked after the development and maintenance of the city. CIDCO made a developmental plan for Navi Mumbai covering 95 villages. 

For the first ten years of the project CIDCO was the planning and administrative body, and as the developer and builder for the project. Taxes on property, land, commercial and water were payable to CIDCO. The 14 nodes which CIDCO created were named Airoli, Ghansoli, Kopar Khairane, Juhu Nagar, Vashi, Turbhe, Sanpada, Nerul, CBD Belapur, Kharghar, Kamothe, New Panvel, Kalamboli, Ulwe, Pushpak and Dronagiri. Each of the nodes is divided into smaller groups called sectors.

Initially only Juhu, Vashi, Nerul and CBD Belapur were developed by CIDCO with housing, schools and community centre roads. But after the arrival of the harbour railway line extension in 1990s, there was an increase in population. CIDCO shifted its development plan to nodes like Kharghar, Kamothe, New Panvel, and Kopar Khairane. In its new development plan, CIDCO land was allocated to builders for housing. CIDCO only provided basic infrastructure like roads, water and electricity, these nodes were developed mostly by private builders according to the CIDCO plan.

On 17 December 1991, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) was created by the state government for maintaining some of the developed nodes of Navi Mumbai.

Local self-government started on 1 January 1992. NMMC was handed nine of the 25 nodes of the Navi Mumbai project area for its administration. However, CIDCO, as a planning authority, has rights on the open plots in these five nodes.

The nine nodes maintained by NMMC are CBD Belapur, Nerul, Vashi, Juhu Nagar, Turbhe, Kopar khairane, Ghansoli, Airoli, Digha, and Sanpada as of 1 January 1998, with the physical and social infrastructure already in place.

With annual budget exceeding Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation, it is rated amongst the richest corporations in Maharashtra.

The municipal corporation is headed by a municipal commissioner and an elected mayor. There are 64 electoral wards in Navi Mumbai. A corporator is elected for each of the wards.

The newly developed nodes of Navi Mumbai on the south: Kharghar, Kamothe, New Panvel and Kalamboli are still maintained by CIDCO. These nodes, which are all beyond CBD Belapur, come under the Raigad district and are under the maintenance of CIDCO.

As per provisional reports of Census India, population of Navi Mumbai as of 2011 is 1,119,477; of which male and female are 611,501 and 507,976 respectively. Although Navi Mumbai city has population of 1,119,477; its urban population is 18,414,288 of which 9,894,088 are males and 8,520,200 are females.

Sedimentology

Sedimentology is the study of sediments such as sand, mud (silt), and clay. How they are laid down today is used to understand how rocks were formed. A person who studied sedimentology is called Sedimentologist. They use their understanding of modern processes to interpret sedimentary rocks and sedimentary structures.

Sedimentary rocks cover most of the Earth's surface, record much of the Earth's history, and contain the fossil record. Sedimentology is closely linked to stratigraphy, which is the study of the physical and temporal (time) relationships between rock layers or strata.

The idea that the processes affecting the earth today are the same as in the past is called uniformitarianism. It is the basis for finding out how sedimentary features in the rock record were formed. By comparing similar features today to features in the rock record—for example, by comparing modern sand dunes to dunes preserved in ancient aeolian sandstones—geologists reconstruct past environments.

Geological map

A geological or geologic map is a special-purpose map made to show geological features. William Smith made the first geological map of England.

Rock units or strata are shown by colour or symbols which show where they are exposed at the surface. Three-dimensional features like faults, folds, with symbols which give these features' orientations.

Stratigraphic contour lines may be used to illustrate the surface of a selected strata illustrating the subsurface topographic trends of the strata. Isopach maps detail the variations in thickness of stratigraphic units. It is not always possible to show this properly: the strata may be extremely fractured, mixed, or otherwise disturbed. There are often gaps (discontinuities) where erosion has removed strata.

Enhanced Fujita scale

The Enhanced Fujita scale is a tornado category scale used to measure tornadoes in the United States and Canada, and some other countries by how bad their damage is. It is a replacement of the old Fujita scale that was made in 1971. The National Weather Service started using it on February 1, 2007 and Canada started in April 2013. More countries have used it since then. The weakest tornadoes on this scale are rated EF0, and the strongest ones are rated EF5. Tornadoes with the EF5 label represent winds faster than 200 miles an hour. No tornadoes in the United States that happened before February 1, 2007 will have their ratings changed to the new scale.

Great White Throne Judgment

In Christianity, the Great White Throne Judgment is the time when the dead people that did not live during the 1,000 years that Satan was imprisoned (in the bottomless pit) come back to life and are judged by God according to their works. This judgment is for those people who are not found written in the Book of Life, a book where the names of those who are going to heaven are written, because they believed Jesus to be the Son of God and the promised Messiah & sacrificial Lamb of Jewish scriptures and the prophets of old. Once the judgment has been finished, Death, Hades, and those who are not found written in the Book of Life will be cast into the Lake of Fire.

Below, Revelation 20:11-15 is written to show the section of the Bible this judgment appears in.
11 Then I saw a Great White Throne and the one sitting on it. The earth and the heavens fled away from His presence, and there was no place found for them. 12 And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before the throne, and the books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the
Book of Life, and the dead were judged according to their works, which are the things recorded inside the books. 13 The sea gave up the dead which were in it, and Death and Hell gave up the dead which were in them: and they were each judged according to their works. 14 Then Death and Hell were cast into the Lake of Fire, which is the second death. 15 Anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire.
According to the Bible, the only way to avoid the Great White Throne Judgment is to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. As it is written in John 3:17-18

17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. 18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

Fibrinogen

Fibrinogen is the clotting element present in blood. When blood comes out of a wound in a vessel, the fibrinogen is activated and forms fibrin, which clots the blood. Although this is fibrinogen's main job, it also forms bridges between platelets. Fibrinogen is a protein made by the liver. It is a dimer (made up of two similar units). Each unit has an alpha, beta, and gamma chain. The alpha and beta chains have a small peptide called fibrinopeptide. 

When fibrinogen is activated to form fibrin, an enzyme called thrombin cleaves the fibrinopeptides off of the alpha and beta chains.

It is possible to examine a small sample of a person's blood to find out how much fibrinogen is in the blood. This helps medical professionals to know if too much or too little fibrinogen is the cause of a patient's medical problems.

British Mandate of Palestine

The British Mandate of Palestine was a League of Nations mandate to the United Kingdom in Palestine. It began after the British had conquered Palestine from the Ottoman Empire in World War I. At the San Remo Conference, on April 25, 1920, the mandate for Palestine was granted to Britain. The mandate became officially operative on September 29, 1923. The mandate ended when the British returned it to the United Nations on May 15, 1948. 

The mandate period was characterized by the conflicting nationalist interests and efforts of the Arabs and the Jews in Palestine. Because of the Balfour Declaration, the Mandatory government started off sympathetic to the Zionists. This led to displeasure in the Arab community in Palestine. The conflicting interests often led to violence, making it hard for the British to rule Palestine. Several times commissions investigated the problems in Palestine, and multiple White Papers came out in order to try solving the problems. In 1939 the British changed its position from the Balfour Declaration in favor of the Palestinian Arabs. However, after World War II, the international community pressed for both an Arab and a Jewish state in Palestine. When the British returned its mandate, the state of Israel was declared, on May 14, 1948. On the next day, the Arab-Israeli war began.

After the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the end of World War I, a lot of territory of the former Ottoman Empire was left on its own. The Allied nations were worried about this. Western countries believed that these countries needed help until they were able to operate on their own. In 1917 Britain had conquered Palestine, also as a result of the Balfour Declaration in which the British declared their support for creating a “national home for the Jewish people”. Consequently, after the Western powers met in Paris, it was decided France would control the mandate for (present-day) Syria and Lebanon, and Britain would have the mandate for (present-day) Israel, Palestine, Jordan and Iraq. From then on, the British army had an increased presence and ruled in Palestine until there was an official civil governing administration placed on July 1, 1920 as a result of the San Remo Conference on April 25, 1920. In this conference the mandate for Palestine and Trans-Jordan was granted to Great Britain by the main Allied Powers. This mandate was eventually formulated by the League of Nations and officially approved by the League Council on July 24, 1922. At this time, the territory of the Palestine mandate consisted of 15,000 square miles with a population of about one million, of which about 80,000 were Jewish inhabitants. 

After the mandate was approved by the League of Nations on July 24, 1922, the mandate became officially operative on September 29, 1923. This led to an increase in Jewish immigration, as about 95,510 thousand Jews immigrated to Palestine from 1920-1926. This was also due to the Balfour Declaration. However the Balfour Declaration also had an impact on the Arab nationalists in Palestine. There was a large increase in Palestinian nationalism, due to an increase in Zionist immigration and settlement. Because of this, riots broke out in 1929 between Zionists and Palestinian nationalists. This was in the form of mob violence in the cities, and in the form of assaults against settlers and sabotage of crops and land in the countryside. As a result of these disturbances between the two groups, two commissions were established by the British. One was the Shaw Commission(focused on finding the underlying conditions leading to the violence), and the other one was the Hope-Simpson Commission(whose goal was to create plans to deal with the problems found by the Shaw Commission). The conclusions of these commissions were put into a British ‘White Paper’. This White Paper included plans on how to in increase better economic conditions, and stressed that the British are to treat the Arabs and Jews equally. In 1933 Arab Executive Committee published a manifesto that spoke out against British and Zionist collaboration. In October 1933 the Arab Executive Committee wanted an anti-government demonstration in Jeruzalem, which caused an outburst of violence. This led to Jewish and Arab leaders having several meetings in 1934 in an effort to decrease their differences. However, this did not help, as rioting continued until 1936.
In 1936 the Arab Revolt started. There was a lot of rioting and violence. The British government wanted to find out why this happened. Therefore, in 1937 the Peel Commission was created. The Peel commission also had to come up with a “long-term solution”. An important outcome of their research was that Jews and Arabs could not live together in one state. Their solution was that the land of Palestine had to be divided in two parts: one state for the Jews and one state for the Arabs. The Zionists accepted this solution. However, the Arabs did not. The Arabs wanted all of Palestine to be an Arab state. After the conclusions of the Peel commission, Arab violence in Palestine started again. With the growing threat of a second world war, the British needed to focus their attention on other places. For that they needed peace and quiet in Palestine. However, because of the Arab uprising, it was difficult for the British to keep the order. Therefor, in 1939 the Mandatory government published a new White Paper to meet Arab demands. It basically said that “Palestine was to remain Arab, and there would be no Jewish state”. This meant that the British had changed their position from the findings of the Peel Commission.

After an Anglo-American Commission did not give the British a solution, the British government decided on February 14, 1947 to give their mandate back to the United Nations. The United Nations then set up the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine. This committee advised a partition of Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state. On November 29, 1947 the General Assembly of the United Nations voted to end the British mandate and to set up a Jewish state and an Arab state in Palestine. The British decided to end the mandate on May 15, 1948. In the afternoon of May 14, 1948 the State of Israel was declared in Tel-Aviv.

Coriaria myrtifolia

Coriaria myrtifolia, called in English redoul, is a plant with poisonus fruits and whose leaves were traditionally used as raw material in tanning (making leather out of skins).

The Spanish name "emborrachacabras" (that is, "getting goats drunk") refers to the leaves' effect on goats that eat them. The French name ("redoul") and Catalan name ("roldor") come from Latin "Rhus tyrius" (Syrian or Tyrian sumac), referring to the leaves use in the traditional tannery industry, to make "Basil" leather.The honeydew from redoul is also toxic

"C. myrtifolia" is a shrub to 2–3 m tall without hairs and with shiny leaves like the leaves of the myrtle ("myrtifolia" means "leaves like the leaves of the myrtle"). It produces small greenish flowers in spring (April to June) in racemes (a kind of inflorescence).
It produces fruits in early summer. The fruits look like berries but they are small nuts (achenes) protected by enlarged and colored petals; it is the same of all the species of the genus "Coriaria". Fruits cannot be eaten because their seeds are very poisonous.

The plants of redoul can fix nitrogen from the air because they have bacteria in their roots.

"C. myrtifolia" is found only around the western Mediterranean Sea, not too far from the coast but near rivers:

Richard More

Richard More (circa. 1614–1696) was a passenger on the "Mayflower" in 1620. He became a sailor and later a ship captain. He saved at least one colony from starvation and helped to keep the colonies prosperous by trading goods to and from England and the West Indies. He fought sea battles against the French in 1664.

Richard and his siblings were taken from their mother and given to the care of Mayflower passengers as indentured servants. Only Richard survived and lived a long and prosperous life. Richard has descendants that can be traced to present day.

The More children travelled as indentured servants to 3 of the "Mayflower" Pilgrims. Ellen, age 8, was assigned to Edward Winslow. She died soon after the ship landed. Jasper, age 7, was a servant of John Carver. Jasper died in December of 1620 while the "Mayflower" was in Harbor. He was buried ashore in what is now the Provincetown area. There is a memorial with his name and that of four others who also died at sea or while the ship was anchored at Cape Cod Harbor in November and December of 1620. Mary, age 4, died soon after the ship landed. Richard resided with the William Brewster family until about mid-1627. The 3 children died of something that was called the ‘common infection’ because so many people died of the same illness. Only Richard survived.

More and his sisters and brother left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" reached land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on 21 November. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.

More was 6 when the "Mayflower" landed at Plymouth Colony. When he stepped on land, he worked with all of the others to help gather supplies for food and shelter and to bury the dead. In the spring of 1621, he attended the first Thanksgiving. Nothing is known of More during the years he lived with the Brewster family from 1620 to 1627, except that his name is on a document giving adults cattle and other livestock.

More was working for Isaac Allerton in 1628. Allerton traded goods and supplies over long distances He fished near Plymouth and Maine. Later he became captain on the ships that supplied the new American colonies.

By early 1642, More joined the Salem church. As a member of this Church he would be allowed to give his opinion and to vote on important matters in Salem.

By the age of twenty-four, More was a captain of his own small ship and traded with the colonies, the West Indies, and England. He moved to Salem Neck Massachusetts and set up his own fishing stand. Drinking water was scarce so More dug a well for himself but allowed all others to use it. He traded tobacco and other merchandise and supplies with Virginia and the West Indies, and made voyages to England.

More took part in sea battles against the French in 1664. They were trying to prevent the early colonist from fishing and trading goods and supplies that the colonists needed to live. This was in an area called the Hudson River region. In 1654 More also was in another Naval battle against the French at Port Royal, Virginia.

More rescued the colonists at the new colony at Cape Fear, North Carolina in 1665.. The people there were dying because they had no food and not enough clothes to keep them warm. The waters around Cape Fear were (and still are) very dangerous for ships yet More brought a shipment of food and supplies to aid them when other captains failed or refused to try.

Richard and his wife Christian Hunter More had 7 children: Samuel, Thomas, Caleb, Richard Jr., Joshua, Susanna, and Christian.

Christian More died March 18, 1676 in Salem.

More died in 1696. His gravestone gives his age as 84, but he did not know his exact birth date. More lived longer than any other male passenger of the "Mayflower". He is buried in the Charter Street Burial Ground in Salem, Massachusetts. He is the only Mayflower passenger to have his gravestone where it was originally placed sometime in the mid-1690s. Also buried nearby in the same cemetery were his two wives, Christian Hunter More and Jane More.

In recent years, More's metal spoon was found during the excavation of the original Plymouth Colony site. His initials were carved into it.

Sacrament of marriage

The sacrament of marriage in the Catholic Church is the marriage contract between two baptized persons of the opposite sex. Each person acquires the irrevocable and exclusive right over the body of the other for the purposes of procreation. Marriage ends with the death of either person. The sacrament of marriage is regulated by divine law, church law, and civil law. The Roman Catholic church does not perform or recognize same-sex marriages. Religions other than Roman Catholicism have different regulations and customs governing marriage.

Marriage

Marriage is a contract by which two people (usually a man and a woman) agree to cohabit together as a couple for an extended period of time or for the rest of their lives with the goal of having children together and starting a family. 

It can be done by signing a contract before a civil authority (civil marriage) or in a formal ceremony officiated by a religious authority. 

The most common form of marriage is a legally binding heterosexual union. Some societies recognize polygamy, which includes polygyny and polyandry. In polygyny, a man may be married to many women; in polyandry a woman may be married to many men. In Senegal, for example, nearly 47 percent of marriages are multiple. A temporary marriage is called a .

The most common age to get married is between 25 to 30 years old. In the Western world, marriage for love is common. In some other places, relatives may plan an arranged marriage. Romani people tend to marry younger.

There are many reasons why people marry, but they usually include one or more of the following:

Marriage usually leads to rights and obligations to those married, these may include:

Marriage is also about sexual intercourse; being unable to have sex, being unwilling to have sex, or having sex outside the marriage may be a reason to undo the marriage.

Often there is also a spiritual part of marriage. In addition to the civil act (wanted by the state) there is sometimes a religious one. A Christian marriage ceremony usually happens in a church. In a Christian marriage, both partners promise to love each other for the rest of their lives. There are certain restrictions on who can marry or be married; those closely related, like brothers and sisters usually cannot marry. This is usually to prevent genetic problems for the children. Those marrying also have to be of a certain age to be able to marry. If that age is not specified it is usually the age of consent. In Hinduism marriage is considered to be holy and is seen as a union of the goddess "Laxmi" and the god "Narayan".

Some countries and religious communities also permit the union of two partners of the same sex. This is generally known as same-sex marriage. In the Netherlands, the marriage law was changed to allow such unions, called "Marriage". Other countries that allow them sometimes have a different name for them.

Stephen Hopkins (Mayflower passenger)

Stephen Hopkins (15811644) He was a passenger on the "Mayflower" in 1620, and signed the Mayflower Compact. He was also an assistant to the Governor of Plymouth Colony in 1636. 

Hopkins was born in 1581 at Upper Clatford, Hampshire, England and was the son of John and Elizabeth Hopkins. He worked as a tanner and merchant.

There is little information about his early life. He married a woman named Mary and they had three children: Elizabeth, Constance, and Giles.

On June 2, 1609 Hopkins sailed over the Atlantic Ocean for Jamestown, Virginia on the "Sea Venture". This was the head ship of a group of ships lead by Sir George Somers. The "Sea Venture" was carrying the new Jamestown governor, Thomas Gates, and was also delivering supplies to Jamestown. 

The ships were on the sea for nearly two months when a severe storm that lasted for five days caused the ships to become separated. The "Sea Venture" was badly damaged and about to sink. They saw land which was the island of Bermuda. They made it to land but were shipwrecked on the island. Fortunately there was much food and water.

In September 1, 1609, they built a long boat and sent 8 men out to try to reach Jamestown to get help but that boat never returned.

In late November 1609, they begin repairing smaller boats enough to take everyone off the island and continue to Jamestown. Hopkins and other people did not agree with Captain Gates and did not think he was a good leader. They had a dispute and Hopkins was charged with mutiny. He was sentenced to death but the people on the ship begged the Captain to take mercy and Hopkins was forgiven.

The settlers in Jamestown did not get along with the Native Americans and they also refused to farm and grow food. They sometimes cheated the Native Americans and they turned against the settlers with violence which lasted for years.

On May 10, 1610, Hopkins and others left the island of Bermuda and came to Jamestown eleven days later. The people in Jamestown were starving to death. They were afraid to go outside the fort and were tearing down their houses for firewood. They were not planting crops. They also refused to trade with the Native Americans or to fish. When he arrived from Bermuda, Governor Gates estimated there was only days worth of food left. He decided to sail to Newfoundland and then went to England. Just as they were preparing to depart, an English ship came into the harbor with supplies and new settlers along with a new governor, Lord de la Warr. The colonists were forced to return and reestablish their fort.

William Shakespeare wrote a play called "The Tempest" in November 1611. It is about a group of passengers being shipwrecked by a mighty storm. That play has a character that was supposed to be Stephen Hokpins.

Back in England, Hopkins' wife Mary unexpectedly died in May 1613, leaving her three young children all alone. Hopkins returned to England to care for his children. Some time later, he married his second wife Elizabeth Fisher.

When Hopkins learned of the planned ‘’Mayflower’’ voyage to Northern Virginia to establish a colony, he decided he would like to go.

The children of Stephen and Elizabeth Hopkins were Damaris, Oceanus, Caleb, Deborah, Damaris, Ruth and Elizabeth. Oceanus was born during the voyage.

Hopkins left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" spotted land. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was damaged and they were forced to land 21 November at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. Hopkins signed the Mayflower Compact.

Hopkins and other men went to land to explore the area for a place where everyone could live. Hopkins was very valuable because he had experience from his time at Jamestown.

One of the earliest missions included William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish , Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edwary Doty. Bradford wrote that they set off in freezing weather, "and when the set sail the salt spray froze on their coats, as if they had been glazed". Of this group Hopkins was the most experienced havings spent time at Jamestown. During their trip they observed Native Americans who appeared to be cutting up a large whale but when they saw the men approaching the natives fled. 

Hopkins taught the pilgrims to hunt and to make friends with the Native Americans. The first meeting with the Native Americans Samoset and Massasoit was held at Hopkins’ house. Over the years Hopkins was a great help to colony leaders such as Myles Standish and Edward Winslow.

Stephen Hopkins died sometime between June 6, 1644 and July 17th of that year. He made his will on June 6, 1644 and requested that he be buried next to his deceased wife, Elizabeth. The inventory was taken on July 17, 1644 and besides his deceased wife, he mentions sons Giles and Caleb, daughter Constance, wife of Nicholas Snow, daughters Deborah, Damaris, Ruth and Elizabeth.
The burial place of Stephen Hopkins is unknown."

Division of Fremantle

The Division of Fremantle is an Australian Electoral Division in Western Australia. It was one of the original 75 divisions for the first federal election in 1901. It is named for the city of Fremantle, which in turn is named for Captain Charles Fremantle. Fremantle was captain of HMS "Challenger", which brought the first settlers to Western Australia. The Division includes the southern suburbs of Perth, Cockburn, Coolbellup, Palmyra, Fremantle and Rottnest Island.

The division originally included Perth's southwestern suburbs. Boundary changes since 1949 have made it a very safe seat for the Australian Labor Party.

Many senior Labor members have held Fremantle. The most famous was John Curtin, Prime Minister of Australia from 1941 to 1945.Others were Kim Beazley (senior), a minister in the Whitlam Government; John Dawkins, a minister in the Hawke Government and Keating Governments; and Carmen Lawrence, the former Premier of Western Australia and a minister in the Keating Government.

Ensete

Ensete is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is one of the three genera in the banana family, Musaceae, and includes the false banana or enset ("E. ventricosum"), an economically important foodcrop in Ethiopia.

The genus "Ensete" was first described by Paul Fedorowitsch Horaninow (1796-1865) in his "Prodromus Monographiae Scitaminarum" of 1862 in which he created a single species, "Ensete edule". However, the genus did not receive general recognition until 1947 when it was revived by E. E. Cheesman in the first of a series of papers in the "Kew Bulletin" on the classification of the bananas, with a total of 25 species.

Taxonomically, the genus "Ensete" has been reduced since Cheesman restore the taxon. Cheesman acknowledged that field study might reveal synonymy and the most recent review of the genus by Simmonds (1960) listed just six. The Plant List accepts eight species as valid.

The plants of "Ensete" are very large herbs without branches that die after producing seeds; They have only one stem that remains short until flowering.

They have very big leaves; the lower parts of the leaves form a false stem so they look as trees. Their fruits are leathery and dry berries with few big and hard seeds.

It is possible to separate "Ensete" into its African and Asian species.

Charles Fremantle

Admiral Sir Charles Howe Fremantle GCB RN (2 June 1800 – 25 May 1869) was a British Royal Navy officer. The city of Fremantle in Western Australia is named after him. Fremantle was the son of Admiral Thomas Fremantle, a friend of Nelson. His mother was Elizabeth, the diarist. He was a nephew of William Henry Fremantle. His elder brother was Thomas Fremantle, 1st Baron Cottesloe. His middle name, Howe, is because his birth date was the anniversary of Lord Howe's victory over the French on the Glorious First of June in 1794. He joined the Royal Navy in 1812.

Fremantle was charged with raping a 15-year-old girl in April 1826. To avoid a scandal, his family paid off witnesses and put pressure on the judge. In August 1826 he was promoted to captain. In 1828 he was given command of the 26-gun frigate HMS "Challenger", and sent to claim the west coast of Australia for the United Kingdom.

HMS "Challenger" left the Cape of Good Hope on 20 March 1829. It arrived in Cockburn Sound on 2 May, and Fremantle went ashore at Garden Island. One week later, Fremantle raised the British flag at the mouth of the Swan River and claimed Western Australia for King George IV.

The new lieutenant governor James Stirling arrived in Cockburn Sound on 2 June on the "Parmelia", bring 69 new settlers. They planned to start a colony at the Swan River in Western Australia. On 8 June they were joined by 56 officers and men from the HMS "Sulphur". On 17 June, Stirling read out loud a legal document which supported Fremantle's earlier proclamation. This was the beginning of the history of Western Australia as a British colony, and later as a state of federal Australia.

Fremantle left the Swan River Colony on 25 August 1829, for the British Army base of Trincomalee, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) where he was based the next couple of years.

While he was there he visited many places including Kowloon. He told the British government that this would be a good site for a British settlement. They agreed and Hong Kong was settled in 1841.

On his way back to England in September 1832, he made his second and final visit to the Swan River Colony.

In 1833 he stopped at Pitcairn Island, where he attempted to make peace in the leadership dispute between Joshua Hill and George Hunn Nobbs.

In 1843 he was given command of HMS "Inconstant" in the Mediterranean Fleet and in 1847 he took command of HMS "Albion". In 1853 he became Captain of HMS "Juno" on the Australia Station.

In 1855 he served as Rear-Admiral controlling the naval transport service for the Crimean War from Balaklava (a city in the Ukraine).

In July 1858 he was given command of the Channel Squadron and in 1863 he became Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth.

He married Isabella Wedderburn on 8 October 1836. They had three children:

He died on 25 may 1869 six days before his 69 birthday and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

Carcharodontosauridae

The Carcharodontosauridae were a family of carnivorous theropod dinosaurs. They are a clade in the Carnosauria. Carcharodontosaurids included some of the largest land predators ever known: "Giganotosaurus", "Mapusaurus", "Carcharodontosaurus", and "Tyrannotitan". All of these rivalled or exceeded "Tyrannosaurus" in size.

Together with the spinosaurids, carcharodontosaurids were the largest predators in the early and middle Cretaceous throughout Gondwana. They were also in North America ("Acrocanthosaurus"), and Asia ("Shaochilong").

Their ages range from 127 to 93 million years ago (mya). After that, they may have been replaced by the smaller abelisaurids in Gondwana and by tyrannosaurids in North America and Asia. If so, this faunal replacement occurred on a global scale.

However, some theropod teeth discovered in the late Cretaceous of Brazil, as well as a fragment of right maxilla appear to belong to carcharodontosaurids. This suggests the group survived until the latest Cretaceous.

In December 2011, Oliver Rauhut described a new genus and species of carcharodontosaurid from the Upper Jurassic (late Kimmeridgian to earliest Tithonian, about 154150 mya) of southeastern Tanzania. "Veterupristisaurus" is the oldest known carcharodontosaurid.

Stenian

The Stenian is the last geological period in the Mesoproterozoic. It began 1.2 billion years ago, and ended at 1 billion years ago. Before it was the Ectasian. It is followed by the Tonian.

The supercontinent Rodinia began forming in this period.
Fossils of the first known sexually-reproducing eukaryotes are found at the end of the previous period in the Hunting Formation on Somerset Island, Nunavut, Canada.

This period includes the Keweenawan Age at about 1100 mya.

Ectasian

The Ectasian is the second geological period in the Mesoproterozoic. It began 1.4 billion years ago and ended at 1.2 billion years ago. The Ectasian came after the Calymmian and before the Stenian.

This period shows for the first evidence of sexual reproduction. The 1.2 billion-year-old Hunting Formation on Somerset Island, Canada, is from the end of the Ectasian. It has the microfossils of the multicellular filaments of "Bangiomorpha pubescens" (a type of red algae). This was the first organism that had sexual reproduction. 

Calymmian

The Calymmian is the first geological period in the Mesoproterozoic. It began 1.6 billion years ago and ended at 1.4 billion years ago.

In the period new land was formed. The supercontinent Columbia broke up during the Calymmian about 1.5 billion years ago.

Statherian

The Statherian is the last geological period in the Palaeoproterozoic. It began 1.8 billion years ago and ended at 1.6 billion years ago. 

The period is marked by new land. The supercontinent Columbia formed at the beginning of this period.

Orosirian

The Orosirian is the third geological period in the Palaeoproterozoic. It began 2.05 billion years ago (bya) and ended at 1.8 bya. 

The latter half of the period was a time of mountain-building on nearly all continents. It was the time when the supercontinent Columbia began to form.

Two of the largest known impact events on Earth happened during the Orosirian. At the beginning of the period, 2023 million years ago (mya), a large asteroid hit the earth and created the Vredefort impact structure. The event that created the Sudbury Basin structure happened near the end of the period about 1850 mya.

Rhyacian

The Rhyacian is the second geological period in the Palaeoproterozoic that began 2.3 billion years ago, and ended at 2.05 billion years ago. Before it was the Siderian It is followed by the Orosirian.

The Huronian (Makganyene) global glaciation began at the start of the Rhyacian. It lasted until 2200 million years ago.

The first known eukaryotes began to evolve in the Rhyacian period. The multicellular Francevillian Group Fossils, at 2.1-Gyr-old are from the Rhyacian period, as well as the enigmatic fossil "Diskagma".

Brandon Pirri

Brandon Pirri (born April 10, 1991, in Toronto, Ontario) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre. He currently plays the Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League (NHL).

He also played at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the ECAC Hockey conference. He was drafted by the Blackhawks with the 59th overall pick in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. He spends most of his time with the Blackhawks AHL farm team, the Rockford IceHogs.

On March 2, 2014, the Blackhawks traded Pirri to the Florida Panthers for a 2014 3rd round pick and a 2016 5th round pick.


Siderian

The Siderian is the first geological period in the Palaeoproterozoic that began 2.5 billion years ago, and ended at 2.3 billion years ago. Before it was the Neoarchaean It is followed by the Rhyacian.

Banded iron formations (BIFs) became very abundant early this period. BIFs were formed as anaerobic algae produced waste oxygen that combined with iron, forming magnetite (FeO, an iron oxide). This process cleared iron from the oceans, presumably turning greenish seas clear. Eventually, without an oxygen sink in the oceans, the process created the oxygen-rich atmosphere of today. This event is known as the oxygen catastrophe, which according to some geologists triggered the Huronian glaciation. The Huronian glaciation took place in the Siderian between 2400 Mya and 2300 Mya.

Televote 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 points.
The presenters started off by giving all contestants 12 points.

Below is a summary of all 12 points received:




Neoarchaean

The Neoarchaean (Neoarchean) is the last geological era in the Archaean eon. It began 2.8 billion years ago and ended 2.5 billion years ago. Before the Neoarchaean era was the Mesoarchaean era and before the Palaeoproterozoic.

Oxygenic photosynthesis first evolved in this era. This led to an oxygen catastrophe in the Palaeoproterozoic era. It was caused by a poisonous buildup of oxygen in the atmosphere. This was created by oxygen-producing photoautotrophs that evolved in the Neoarchaean. The supercontinent Kenorland formed during this period, about 2.7 billion years ago.

Mesoarchaean

The Mesoarchaean (Mesoarchean) is the third geological era in the Archaean eon. It began 3.2 billion years ago, and ended 2.8 billion years ago. Before the Mesoarchaean era was the Palaeoarchaean era. After the Mesoarchaean era was the Neoarchaean.

Fossils from Australia show that stromatolites have lived on Earth since the Mesoarchaean. The Pongola glaciation occurred 2.9 billion years ago. The first supercontinent Vaalbara broke up during this time, around 3.2 billion years ago. The second supercontinent Ur existed during this era, 3.1 billion years ago.

Palaeoarchaean

The Palaeoarchaean (Paleoarchean) is the second geological era in the Archaean eon. It began 3.6 billion years ago and ended 3.2 billion years ago. Before it was the Eoarchaean and after it was the Mesoarchaean. 

The name comes from the Greek word "palaios". "Palaios" means "ancient". The oldest fossil life forms are cyanobacteria found in strata 3.46 billion years old. These rocks are in Western Australia. 

The first supercontinent, Vaalbara, formed during this period.

Bridal Chorus

The "Bridal Chorus" is a piece of music from Richard Wagner's opera "Lohengrin" (1850). Transcriptions of the piece for pipe organ or other instruments are sometimes used at western world weddings as the bride enters the wedding site. The piece is slow and solemn. It is sometimes called the Wedding March or the Bridal March.

Eoarchaean

The Eoarchaean (Eoarchean) is the first geological era in the Archaean eon that began 4 billion years ago, and ended 3.6 billion years ago. Before it was the Hadean It is followed by the Palaeoarchaean. 

The Eoarchaean is the earliest period of geology after the solidification of Earth's crust. The abiotic origins of life (abiogenesis) have been dated to a time window from 4 to 3.6 billion years ago when atmospheric pressure values ranged from 100 to 10 bar.

It was formerly officially unnamed and usually referred to as the first part of the "Early Archaean" (now an obsolete name) together with the later Palaeoarchaean Era. It is the first part of the Archaean Eon, preceded by the Hadean Eon.

The Eoarchaean was followed by the Palaeoarchaean Era.

The name comes from two Greek words: "eos" (dawn) and "archaios" (ancient). The 1st supercontinent Vaalbara appeared around the end of this period around 3.6 billion years ago.

A characteristic of the Eoarchean is that Earth possessed a firm crust for the first time. However, this crust may have been incomplete at many sites and areas of lava may have existed at the surface. The beginning of the Eoarchaean is characterized by heavy asteroid bombardment within the inner solar system: the Late Heavy Bombardment. The Eoarchaean is the first phase of our planet from which solid rock formations survived. The largest is the Isua greenstone belt at the southwest coast of Greenland. It appeared during the Eoarchaean around 3.8 billion years ago. The Acasta Gneiss within the Canadian Shield have been dated to be 4.03 Ga and are therefore the oldest preserved rock formations. In 2008 another rock formation was discovered in the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt in northern Québec in Canada which has been dated to be 4.28 Ga. These formations are presently under intense investigation.

Earth's oceans formed 3.8 billion years ago.

White flight

The term white flight represents large-scale migrations of White people from large cities around Europe and the United States starting in the mid 20th century. Those large cities were primarily in Midwestern States and Northeastern States: Whites relocated out of those regions and into Southeastern and Southwestern States like Arizona and Texas. Midwestern cities like Chicago, Detroit or St. Louis, however, lost population of many Whites since the mid 20th century.

Climate of California

The climate of California varies widely from desert to alpine depending on latitude, elevation and how close the area is to the coast. That's not all, because for much of its length, it has a range of mountains on its Eastern side.

Most of the coastal and southern parts of the state have a Mediterranean climate with somewhat rainy winters and dry summers. The deserts in the south of the state have very hot summers and mild winters. Parts of the south have a dry steppe climate, for example San Diego.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) averages from 19812010, 
California is the 13th warmest state in the United States with the average annual temperature of 58.4 °F (14.7 °C) 

Northwest California has rainy cool winters and dry summers with temperatures in the summers in the upper 60s to the upper 70s. 

The Central Valley has a semi-arid climate with temperatures in the winter sometimes at nights fall below 30 °F (–1.1 °C) and at daytime rises above 80 °F (26.7 °C) with summers being from 80 °F (26.7 °C) to 100 °F (38 °C) at day. 

The desert areas in southern California has a hot and very dry climate with precipitation in some areas below 5 inches (127 mm) a year. Temperatures are mild in southern California's desert in the winter and temps can range from 60°F (15.5 °C) to 80°F (26.7 °C) at daytime with nights being chilly with temperatures ranging from 35°F (1.7 °C) to 50°F (10 °C). Temperatures are usually very hot during the day in desert places like Needles, San Bernardino and Palm Springs in the summer with daytime temperatures being from 105°F (40.5 °C) to 120°F (48°C) sometimes reaching above 120 °F (48 °C) and with nights being from 75°F (23.9 °C) to 90°F (32.2 °C). 

The hottest place in the world is in the desert of California, Death Valley. Death Valley once had a temperature of 134 °F (56.7 °C) on July 10, 1913 although some meteorologists dispute this temperature reading. The average annual temperature in Death Valley from 1981–2010 was 76.7 °F (24.8 °C) with an average July mean temperature of 101.8 °F (38.8 °C).

Religion in Vietnam

Officially, Vietnam is an atheist state. Despite this, many of its citizens are religious. The three main religions in Vietnam are Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism. Sometimes, they are grouped together as one religion called the three teachings or "tam giáo". According to many studies, 70-90% of Vietnamese people are "tam giáo". 8% are Christians (mostly Roman Catholic) and 1-2% practice indigenous, animist religions including Hinduism. About 1% are not religious but have a strong Buddhist influence in their life.

Despite strong links in the older adult population, the younger population of Vietnam is quite different, with low numbers of young people believing religious ideas. The religious ideas that don't fit state thinking aren't emphasized enough. 

The earliest established religion was Hinduism during the Cham Hindu Kingdom era. Later, Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism spread. Today, these religions are grouped into the same religion known as the "triple religion" or Tam Giao, which has many followers. Later religions in Vietnam include Christianity and Islam. New religious movements include Hoa Hao Buddhism and Cao Dai. Hinduism is still practised by a small Cham minority who live mainly in central Vietnam.

Among the religions in Vietnam, Buddhism has the most followers. According to the statistics of the Buddhist Church of Vietnam, 45 million people are taking refuge in the three jewels and about 12 million are just Buddhist making it about 57 million Buddhists. There are two main branches of Buddhism in Vietnam, Mahayana, and Theravada. Mahayana is more popular with the people while Theravada being more popular with the Khmer people.

Archie Barton

Dr Archie Barton, AM (March 1936 – 18 October 2008) was an Aboriginal Australian activist. He fought for land rights and compensation for the Maralinga Tjarutja people against the Australian and British governments in the 1980s and 1990s. He played an important role in the 20-year campaign of the Maralinga people regaining access to their land after the British nuclear weapons tests.

Barton was born in South Australia in March 1936; the exact date is unknown. He was born at a siding on the east-west Trans-Australian Railway line, about east of Ooldea. His mother was a Pitjantjatjara woman from the Maralinga lands. It is not known who his father was, and Barton never knew him, but he is believed to have been a White railway worker. He was given the surname "Barton" because that was the name of the siding where he was born (Barton Siding). Archie spent his infancy in the care of his mother at Ooldea, which at the time was a mission station for Aboriginal people.

At the age of five, Barton became a victim of the Stolen Generations. He was taken from his mother and placed into a children's home in Port Augusta run by the Christian Brethren. When he was captured, he was hiding behind the skirt of Daisy Bates, a well-known writer who was living near Ooldea at the time. Archie never saw his mother again.

He was taught by the Christian Brethren until he was 12 years old. After this, he was sent to work on agricultural stations. He worked at a number of stations during his teenage years, and was often aggravated at being treated differently to White workers. After this, he worked several jobs as a labourer, including on the railway. In his twenties, Barton moved to Adelaide where he worked digging trenches for the South Australian Gas Company. While there, he became an alcoholic, got tuberculosis and spent a year in a sanitorium. By the time he was in his thirties, his addiction to alcohol was so bad that a doctor gave him six months to live. He immediately gave up drinking, and later began working for an Aboriginal alcohol-rehabilitation service in Port Augusta.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the British government tested nuclear weapons at the Woomera Test Range in central South Australia. The first two bombs were exploded at Emu Field, located to the north of Maralinga, in 1953. Major tests were done at Maralinga in 1956 and 1957, and multiple smaller tests were made up until 1963. Barton was still a young man at the time. Maralinga was Barton's mother's country, and remains the homeland of the Maralinga Tjarutja people. Most of the indigenous families living in these lands were forced to move out of the area before the major tests began. They were placed in Aboriginal missions and settlements built by the government.

One of these settlements was Yalata, located far to the south. The community at Ooldea was relocated there in 1952. In 1981, Barton was chosen as a community adviser for Yalata. Four years later, in January 1985, the government of South Australia handed back the native title to the Maralinga Tjarutja lands. Barton was appointed administrator of the newly created Maralinga Land Rights Council. However, the land remained contaminated from the nuclear waste and was not fit to be lived in.

In his role as administrator, Barton led the Maralinga people in their campaign to get the land cleaned and restored so that they could safely return to living there. He represented his people before many enquiries and commissions, in both Canberra and London. A royal commission into the nuclear tests was done by the Australian government. This was the McClelland Royal Commission, for which Barton helped provide evidence. Ten years later, in 1995, the government paid the community AU$13.5 million in compensation. Barton and two elders travelled to London in 1991 and 1992, to negotiate with the British government. They met with the leader of the House of Lords, Viscount Cranborne, to whom Barton presented two bags of soil from Maralinga, tainted with plutonium.

The clean-up of the land was estimated to cost over AU$100 million. It took several years before the British offered an acceptable contribution, which was about £20 million. The clean-up was completed in 2000, but the test sites themselves will remain poisonous for many thousands of years.

Barton served as the administrator of the Maralinga Land Rights Council for 20 years (1985–2005). He was forced to resign the office in 2005, when it was discovered that he had stolen $230,000 of community money. His friends blamed old age and the stress of financial demands from his relatives. His reputation and position in the community was destroyed, and he became poor, unhealthy and an outcast. He lived in sheds in Whyalla and Port Augusta during this time. He was welcomed back into the community shortly before his death, but by that time he was already very weak.

Barton died on 18 October 2008, in Ceduna. He was buried at Oak Valley, the new settlement built near Maralinga when the traditional owners returned to their lands. He no children of his own, but looked after the children and grandchildren of his long-term partner Mary Harrison.

Barton was awarded the South Australian Aboriginal of the Year in 1988, and was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1989. In 1996, he was given an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Adelaide.

In 2001, he became one of the founding members of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. He served as a member of the National Indigenous Council from 2004 to 2005. He also served as a director of Imparja Television, the national Aboriginal broadcasting network.

La Soufrière (volcano)

La Soufrière (“The Sulfurer”) or Soufrière Saint Vincent is an active volcano on the island of Saint Vincent in the Windward Islands of the Caribbean.
At , La Soufrière is the highest peak on Saint Vincent as well as the highest point in the island country of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

It is in the northern part of the island of Saint Vincent in the Saint David and Charlotte parishes. The mountain is surrounded by the towns of Wallibou and Chateaubelair to the southwest, Fancy to the north, Orange Hill and Georgetown to the southeast and the Richmond Peak and Mount Brisbane to the south.
Soufrière is an active composite volcano (or stratovolcano) with a lake in the crater and is the island's youngest and northernmost volcano. It has a main crater of 1.6 km in diameter, with the northeast edge cut by another smaller crater in 1812.

The first historical eruption of the volcano took place during 1718; it and the 1812 eruption produced major explosions. Much of the northern end of the island was devastated by a major eruption in 1902 that killed 1,680 people; this eruption was just hours before the eruption of Mount Pelée on Martinique.

Several volcanoes in the Caribbean are named Soufrière (French: "sulphur mine"). Two of them are Soufrière Hills on Montserrat and La Grande Soufrière on Guadeloupe.

On 9 April 2021, the volcano erupted causing over 20,000 to evacuate.

Kelli McCarty

Kelli McCarty (born September 6, 1969) is an American model, actress and a former Miss USA. She played Beth Wallace in the television series "Passions". She also appeared in softcore adult movies in her career.

McCarty was born in Liberal, Kansas.

Liberal, Kansas

Liberal is a city in southwest Kansas, close to the Oklahoma state border. In 2020, 19,825 people lived there. The city was founded in 1888 and incorporated in the same year.

Western Australian Party

The Western Australian Party (WAP) was an Australian political party that operated in 1906. It was a liberal party which wanted to protect the rights of Western Australians and oppose the Labour Party. Its supporters came from the Protectionist Party and the Anti-Socialist Party. John Forrest, a minister in Alfred Deakin's government, became leader the party. Candidates were selected for all electorates in the 1906 federal election. By the time the election was held, support for the party had ceased. Forrest was elected, but not as a WAP member. However, the party did elect one member, William Hedges, as the member for Fremantle. He was a member of the WAP, although he sat as an independent and, like Forrest, joined the Commonwealth Liberal Party when it began in 1909.

The party policies were explained in a 12-point program. Many of these were to promote the interests of Western Australia as a member of the new Australian federation. This included keeping as much government revenue as possible. It also included items important to Western Australia such as coastal defence, and building a railway to the eastern states. It also wanted to introduce deciaml currency, and metric weights and measures.

École Centrale de Lille

École Centrale de Lille is a renowned graduate engineering school in France. It is in a campus of the University of Lille (Northern France).

Its different curricula lead to the following French & European degrees :

Academic activities and industrial applied research are performed mainly in French and English languages. Students from a dozen of nationalities participate to the different curricula at École Centrale de Lille.

Most of the 1500 graduate engineer students at École Centrale de Lille live in dedicated residential buildings nearby research labs and metro public transports on a campus that is shared with 20,000 students from Lille University of Science and Technology.

École Centrale de Lille was founded as École des arts industriels et des mines de Lille in 1854, with support from scientists such as Frédéric Kuhlmann and Louis Pasteur. It succeeded to the municipal chairs of experimental physics, applied chemistry and mechanics that were established in 1817. It became a technical university in 1872 with the integration of the Institut industriel du Nord. Since mid 19th century, the Baccalauréat and completion of undergraduate studies have been a prerequisite for admission. The initial focus was on civil engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry and manufacturing engineering. Electrical engineering full courses were added in 1892, automobile design has been taught from 1899 onwards. More than 200 students graduated in year 1914. Aerodynamics studies started in 1930. A stress on automatic control and computers was initiated in 1957. Later came courses and research in computer science (1957), supply chain management, materials science, micro-electronics, telecommunications, nanotechnologies (1994).

Since early 20th century, student admission has been based on a competitive exam after attending a French classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles or similar undergraduate studies.

It was originally in Lille central district. It then moved in 1968 in the modern campus of Lille University of Science and Technology, in the south-east suburb of Lille.

Admission to the Centralien engineering Programme implemented at École Centrale de Lille is possible after two/three year scientific undergraduate studies and requires success to either: 

The Centralien Programme typically lasts three years and results in a master's degree, augmented with international experience. Thus undergraduate studies + the Centralien Programme account for more than a cumulated 300 ECTS credits as applicable in the European education system.
However, graduate students enrolled in the TIME double degree procedure are required to spend two-years at École Centrale de Lille and spend two years in the TIME-partner institute for a total of four years resulting in a double master's degree.

Research activities at École Centrale de Lille relate to the following topics:

Observable universe

In Big Bang cosmology, the observable universe is what, in theory, can be seen from Earth. That is light, or other signals, which has had time to reach the Earth since the beginning of the cosmological expansion. The observable universe is a spherical volume (a ball) centered on the observer, regardless of the shape of the universe as a whole. Every place in the universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one centered on Earth.

The word "observable" does not depend on whether modern technology actually allows detection of radiation from an object in this region. It simply means that it is possible "in principle" for light or other signals from the object to reach an observer on Earth. In practice, there is much that we cannot see. We can see light only from as far back as when particles were first able to emit photons that were not quickly re-absorbed by other particles. Before then, the universe was filled with a plasma that was opaque to photons. 

Sometimes astrophysicists distinguish between the "visible" universe, which includes only signals emitted since recombination—and the "observable" universe, which includes signals since the beginning of the cosmological expansion (that is, the end of the inflationary epoch in modern cosmology). The radius of the visible universe, is about 14.0 billion parsecs (about 45.7 billion light years), while the comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is about 14.3 billion parsecs (about 46.6 billion light years), about 2% larger.

The best estimate of the age of the universe as of 2013 is 13.798 ± 0.037 billion years. Due to the expansion of the universe humans are observing objects that were originally much closer but are now considerably farther away (as defined in terms of cosmological proper distance, which is equal to the comoving distance at the present time) than a static 13.8 billion light-years distance. The diameter of the observable universe is estimated at about 28 billion parsecs (93 billion light-years), putting the edge of the observable universe at about 46–47 billion light-years away.

Brezhnev Doctrine

The Brezhnev Doctrine was a policy promoted in 1968 by Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. It said that the Soviet Union had the right to use military force to maintain the strict rule of the Communist Party in nearby socialist countries. The Brezhnev Doctrine was used to justify the invasion of Czechoslovakia, earlier in 1968 after Alexander Dubček introduced political reforms there. The principles of the doctrine were so broad that the Soviets used it to justify intervention in the non-Warsaw Pact nation of Afghanistan in 1979, starting the Soviet war in Afghanistan. The Brezhnev Doctrine stayed in effect until it was ended with the Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980–1981. 

Comédie-Française

The Comédie-Française or Théâtre-Français is one of the few state theatres in France. It is the only state theatre to have its own company of actors. The company's primary venue is the Salle Richelieu. The theatre is part of the Palais-Royal complex at 2 rue de Richelieu on the Place André-Malraux in the 1st arrondissement of Paris.

The theatre has also been known as the "Théâtre de la République" and "La maison de Molière" (English: House of Molière). It inherited the latter name from the troupe of the best-known playwright associated with the Comédie-Française, Molière. He was considered the patron of French actors. He died seven years before “La maison de Molière” was rechristened the “Comédie-Française,” and the company continued to be known popularly by the former name long after the official change of name.

The Comédie-Française today has a repertoire of 3,000 works and three theatre locations in Paris (salle Richelieu; théâtre du Vieux-Colombier; Studio-Théâtre)

Jim Thornton

Jim Thornton (born March 8, 1965) is an American radio and television personality. He is currently an afternoon anchor on all-news radio station KNX 1070 in Los Angeles, California. He is also the announcer on television game show "Wheel of Fortune". He was born in Huntington, West Virginia, United States.

He was confirmed as the show's new announcer on June 13, 2011. He was also a guest announcer on "The Price is Right" after previous announcer Rod Roddy's death in 2003.

William Brewster

Col. William Brewster III (1566 – April 10, 1644) was an English official who was a passenger on the "Mayflower" in 1620. He was a religious leader both in Europe and in Plymouth Colony. He was also one of the signers of the Mayflower Compact. 

William Brewster III was the son of Capt. William Brewster, Jr. (1533-1622) and Mary Smythe Simkinson (1537-1655), Capt. William Brewster, Jr. was the son of Col. William Brewster, Sr. (1500-1616) and Maud Mann (1506-1619), William III lived in Scrooby, Nottinghamshire, England.

Brewster studied at Peterhouse, Cambridge. Cambridge was a university where many people wanted to change the Church of England. People who agreed with this started different religions. They were called Separatists. In England, Separatists were put into jail.

Brewster worked for a time for William Davison in the Netherlands. Davison went to jail because he was a Separatist. When Davison went to jail, Brewster went back home to Scrooby for a time. He became a postmaster. Brewster began a Separatist church in his house. In 1607, He also went to jail for a short time for doing this in. Brewster and other members of the Church decided to move to Netherlands in 1608. They hoped that would be able to practice their religion there. To leave England without permission was illegal, so they left in secret. In 1609, he was chosen as the leader of the congregation.

In Leiden, Brewster taught English. In 1616 he was a printer and made religious books for sale in England. In 1619, Brewster and Edward Winslow published a religious booklet which disagreed with King James I and the Church of England. The King ordered Brewster's arrest. He was forced to hide. The printing press was taken by the English ambassador and Brewster's partner was arrested. The congregation had already decided to leave Leiden for the New World. While Brewster was in hiding, the other members of the church looked to others such as John Carver and Robert Cushman to make the plans. Brewster escaped and, with the help of Cushman, he and Cushman were able to get aboard the "Mayflower" with their friends. His wife and two of his sons, Love and Wrestling, were also passengers.

The Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" reached land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21. William Brewster, the only college-educated Pilgrim, most likely wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. 
Brewster became the senior religious leader at Plymouth Colony. He also served as an advisor to Governor William Bradford.

The Brewster and his wife Mary had six children: Jonathan, Patience, Fear, who married Isaac Allerton, Unnamed child, Love Brewster, and Wrestling Brewster

Brewster's son Jonathan, arrived the next year on the ship "Fortune". Brewster's daughters Patience and Fear arrived aboard the "Anne".

Brewster was given land on the islands of Boston Harbor. Four of those islands are named after him. In 1632, Brewster also received lands in nearby Duxbury and moved there from Plymouth Colony to build a farm. 

An epidemic killed many English and Indians in the region. William Brewster lost two daughters, Fear and Patience in 1634.

William Brewster died and was buried on 10 April 1644 at Burial Hill, Plymouth, Massachusetts. There is a memorial for him which says it is in honor of "Elder William Brewster Patriarch (father) of the Pilgrims and their Ruling Elder 1609–1644". The burial place of his wife Mary is unknown.

Civil rights movements

The civil rights movements was a series of worldwide political movements for equal civil and political rights. Many times in history, people have used nonviolence to show that they are equal without hurting anybody. Other times were more violent with people who began to rebel against others. Many of these movements did not fully achieve their goals. However, many of them helped make steps toward equality.

The main goal of the civil rights movements is that all people's rights are equally protected by the law, including the rights of minorities. Civil rights movements are different from each country. The LGBT rights movement, Women's rights movement, and many racial minority rights movements are still continuing to fight for equal rights.

The Angolan War of Independence was fought from 1961 to 1975. Angola fought against Portugal. Portugal was making people in Angola farm cotton. Three different groups in Angola were against Portugal. Millions of people died during the war.

Before 1974, the Portuguese Empire also controlled Portuguese Guinea. From 1963-1974, in the Guinea-Bissau War of Independence, the people in Guinea fought for their independence. In 1974 they won, and formed the independent country of Guinea-Bissau.

The Mozambican War of Independence was fought from 1964 until 1975. It was fought between Portugal, which controlled Mozambique; and the Mozambique Liberation Front or Frelimo (). The Portuguese won the conflict, using guerrilla soldiers. However, because of a coup d'état in Portugal, Mozambique became independent on June 25, 1975.

In Northern Ireland, the Campaign for Social Justice was formed in Belfast in 1964. Next the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association was formed. These groups wanted to:
These demands for reform caused a backlash by some in the unionist majority. This caused The Troubles to start. The Troubles were a civil war that lasted for more than 30 years.

They used the same methods used by the American Civil Rights Movement: nonviolent marches, pickets, sit-ins, and protests. The first civil rights march in Northern Ireland was held on 24 August 1968 between Coalisland and Dungannon.

Segregation was an attempt by white Southerners to separate the races. They did this to strengthen white pride and to be more powerful over African Americans. Segregation was often called the Jim Crow system.

Segregation became common in Southern states after the end of Reconstruction in 1877. Reconstruction followed the Civil War (1861-1865). During Reconstruction, Republican governments in the Southern states were run by black people. The Reconstruction governments had passed laws opening up economic and political opportunities for black people. However, by 1877, the Democratic Party had gained control of government in the Southern states. These Southern Democrats wanted to reverse black advances made during Reconstruction. To that end, they began to pass local and state laws that said certain places were "For Whites Only" and others for "Colored". Black people had separate schools, transportation, restaurants, hospitals, and parks. Usually, they were not as good as the white-only places. Over the next 75 years, Jim Crow signs went up to separate the races in every possible place.

The system of segregation also included not letting African-Americans vote (this is called disfranchisement). Between 1890 and 1910, all Southern states passed laws that made it difficult or impossible for black people to vote. For example, some laws said a person had to be able to read and write in order to vote. A lot of black people had no access to education and property ownership. Because black people could not vote, they were powerless to prevent whites from segregating all aspects of Southern life. They could do little to stop discrimination in public places, education, economic opportunities, or housing.

Conditions for black people in Northern states were somewhat better. Black people were usually free to vote in the North, but there were so few of them that their voices were barely heard. Segregated facilities were not as common in the North. Black people were usually denied entrance to the best hotels and restaurants. Schools in New England were usually integrated (with black and white students together). However, those in the Midwest generally were not.

On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a member of the Montgomery, Alabama, branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), was told to give up her seat on a city bus to a white person. When Parks refused to move, she was arrested. The local NAACP, led by Edgar D. Nixon, recognized that Parks' arrest might rally local blacks to protest segregated buses. Montgomery's black community had long been angry about their mistreatment on city buses, where white drivers were often rude and abusive. The community had previously considered a boycott of the buses. The Montgomery Bus Boycott was a success, with support from the 50,000 blacks in Montgomery. It lasted for more than a year. This event showed the American public that blacks in the South would not stop protesting until the end of segregation. A federal court ordered Montgomery's buses desegregated in November 1956. The boycott ended with the blacks winning the right to sit wherever they wanted.

A young Baptist pastor named Martin Luther King, Jr., was president of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization that directed the boycott. The protest made King a national figure. King became the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference when it was founded in 1957. They wanted to celebrate the NAACP legal strategy by encouraging the use of nonviolence. These activities included marches, demonstrations, and boycotts. The violent white response to black direct action eventually forced the federal government to confront the issues of injustice and racism in the South.

In addition to his large following among blacks, King had a powerful appeal to liberal Northerners that helped him influence national public opinion. His advocacy of nonviolence attracted supporters among peace activists. He formed alliances in the American Jewish community. He also developed supporters from the ministers of wealthy, influential Protestant congregations in Northern cities. King often preached to those congregations, where he raised funds for SCLC.

The Chicano Movement is a political, social, and cultural movement by Mexican Americans. The Chicano Movement addresses negative ethnic stereotypes of Mexican people in the media and by Americans. People such as Tiburcio Vasquez and Joaquin Murietta became folk heros to Mexican Americans. They refused to obey White Americans.

The American Indian Movement is a Native American activist organization in the United States. It was founded in 1968 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The organization was formed to stop issues concerning the Native American urban community in Minneapolis. They wanted to stop poverty, housing, treaty issues, and police harassment.

The first feminism equality issues was suffrage rights. This led women to get the right to vote. The second feminist issue involved economic equality (for example, getting paid the same as men if they did the same kind of work).

Lesbians are also part of women's rights. The lesbian feminist groups, such as the Lavender Menace, are a lesbian activism group.

The events of the Hawaii Supreme Court promoted the United States Congress to create the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. This act forbids the federal government from accepting same-sex relationships to get married. Currently 30 states have passed state constitutional amendments that ban same-sex marriage. However, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont made gay marriage legal.

Before 1993, lesbian and gay people were not allowed to serve in the United States military. Under the "Don't ask, don't tell" policy, they were only allowed to serve in the military if they did not tell anyone of their sexual orientation. The Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 allowed homosexual men and women to serve openly in the armed forces. Since September 20, 2011, gays, lesbians, and bisexuals have been able to serve openly. However, transsexual service-members still cannot serve openly, due to Department of Defense medical policies which consider gender identity disorder to be a medically disqualifying condition.

People who oppose gay rights in the United States have been political and religious conservatives. These people cite a number of Bible passages from the Old and New Testaments as their reason. The most opposition of gay rights are in the South and other states with a large rural population. Many organizations have opposed the gay rights movement. These include the American Family Association, the Christian Coalition, Family Research Council, Focus on the Family, Save Our Children, NARTH, the national Republican Party, the Roman Catholic Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Southern Baptist Convention, Alliance for Marriage, Alliance Defense Fund, Liberty Counsel, and the National Organization for Marriage. A number of these groups have been named as anti-gay hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

The Civil Rights Movements in Germany was a left-wing backlash against the post-Nazi Party era of the country. The movement took place mostly among disillusioned students and was largely a protest movement to others around the globe during the late 1960s.

A general strike broke out across France in May 1968. It became a revolutionary problem. It was discouraged by the French Communist Party. It was finally suppressed by the government, which accused the communists of plotting against the Republic. Some philosophers and historians have argued that the rebellion was the single most important revolutionary event of the 20th century because it wasn't participated in by a single demographic, such as workers or racial minorities, but was a popular uprising, superseding ethnic, cultural, age and class boundaries.

Seokbosangjeol

Seokbosangjeol (釋譜詳節) is the biography of Gautama Buddha written in Korean. It was made by Sejo of Joseon when he was still a prince. 

Sejo of Joseon used Chinese books as source text for the book. It features books like Lotus Sutra, Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva Pūrvapraṇidhāna Sūtra, and Amitabha Sutra. It was the first time that someone had translated Buddhist sutras into Korean language from Chinese language. The book was made after Sejo of Joseon's mother died. People from around Korea were able to buy the book. It was published in 1447. It came in 24 volumes. Many of the volumes have been lost. The National Library of Korea owns a copy.

The book is one of the first times that the "hangul" alphabet was ever printed in a book.

NML Cygni

NML Cygni or V1489 Cygni is a red hypergiant star. It is one of the largest stars known at present. One study says its radius is 1,640 times the Sun's radius (solar radii), but an older study from 2010 says its radius is only 1,183 solar radii. It is one of the brightest supergiant stars. It was discovered in 1965, by Gerry Neugebauer, D.M. Martz and Robert Leighton. The name 'NML' comes from the names of the three discoverers. 

NML Cygni's distance from Earth is about 5,250 light-years. This star has dust surrounding it. It has a bean-shaped asymmetric nebula with water vapour. It is a semiregular variable star. This means its brightness changes over 940 days. 

This star is a part of the Cygnus OB2 association, which is 1.74 ± 0.2 kpc away. This is one of the nearest massive star groups to the Sun. This group includes some of the most massive and brightest stars known, including the suspected luminous blue variable Cyg OB2 #12. NML Cygni has lots of oxygen. Molecules like HO, Silicon monoxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, carbon monosulfide, sulfur monoxide, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide are also in the star.

NML Cygni has two dense outer layers of dust and molecules. The star is also losing mass by slowly throwing gas into space. The dust envelopes are formed by this process.

Off-by-one error

An Off-by-one error is a logic error that often occurs in Computer programming and that often involves the checking of boundary conditions.
A fencepost error (occasionally called a telegraph pole or lamp-post error) is a specific type of off-by-one error. The following problem illustrates the error:

The intuitive answer 10 is wrong. The fence has 10 sections, but 11 posts.

The reverse error occurs when the number of posts is known and the number of sections is assumed to be the same. The actual number of sections is one less than the number of posts. 

More generally, the problem can be stated as follows:

The correct answer may be "n" − 1, "n", or "n" + 1, depending on the conditions. The precise problem definition must be carefully considered, as the setup for one situation may give the wrong answer for other situations. Fencepost errors come from counting things rather than the spaces between them, or vice versa, or by neglecting to consider whether one should count one or both ends of a row.

Off by one errors often occur with loops. If there are a number of fields, eg. in an array, and there is a loop over the array, an off-by-one error means that either there is one iteration too few to cover all elements, or one too many. In the first case, one element of the array is left out, in the second the index of the array will be outside its dimensions. The second error usually leads to an runtime error, because the program checks the size of the data structure, and sees that there are too few elements for the iteration. The first error is more problematic, because it usually is not detected. All that may point to the error is that one element is not initialized or does not have the expected value. 

Logic error

In Computer programming a logic error is a bug in a program, which causes it to work incorrectly. A logic error produces unintended behaviour or output. In many cases, the syntax of the program is correct. This means that the environment used to make the program will not show an error. This makes logic errors difficult to find.

This example function in C to calculate the average of two numbers contains a logic error. It is missing brackets in the calculation, so it compiles and runs but does not give the right answer.

Frankenstein (1931 movie)

Frankenstein is a 1931 horror movie. It was directed by James Whale. It is based on the book "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley. The movie stars Colin Clive, Mae Clarke, John Boles, and Boris Karloff. The movie was a great success with both audiences and critics. It was followed by multiple sequels, including "The Bride of Frankenstein" and "The Son of Frankenstein".


Cato the Younger

Cato the Younger (Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis, 95 BC, Rome – April 46 BC, Utica) was a politician and statesman in the late Roman Republic, and a follower of the Stoic philosophy. He was known as "Cato Minor" to distinguish him from his great-grandfather (Cato the Elder). A noted orator, he had great moral integrity. He could not be bribed, and disliked the political corruption of the age. He is remembered for his stubbornness and for his lengthy conflict with Julius Caesar.

Plutarch tells a story about Cato's peers' immense respect for him, even at a young age. During a Roman ritual military game, called "Troy", in which all aristocratic teenagers participated as a sort of "coming of age" ceremony, a mock battle with wooden weapons was performed on horseback. While the child of one of Sulla's surrogates was chosen by the adult organizers to lead one of the "teams," the team refused to follow him because of his character, and when they were finally asked whom they would follow, the boys unanimously chose Cato.

As a military tribune, Cato was sent to Macedon in 67 BC at the age of 28. He was given command of a legion. He led his men from the front, sharing their work, food, and sleeping quarters. He was strict in discipline and punishment but was popular with his legionaries. When in Macedon, he got the news that his brother Caepio was dying in Thrace. He set off to see him but his brother died before he arrived. Cato was overwhelmed by grief and, for once, he spared no expense to organize lavish funeral ceremonies.

On his return to Rome in 65 BC, Cato was elected to the position of quaestor. One of his first moves was to prosecute former quaestors for misusing funds and dishonesty. Cato also prosecuted Sulla's informers, who had acted as head-hunters during Sulla's dictatorship. Cato did this even when the men were well connected politically. At the end of the year, Cato stepped down from his quaestorship amid popular acclaim, but he never ceased to keep an eye on the treasury, always looking for irregularities.

As senator, Cato was scrupulous and determined. He never missed a session of the Senate and publicly criticized those who did so. From the beginning, he aligned himself with the "Optimates", the conservative faction of the Senate. Many of the Optimates at this time had been Sulla's personal friends, whom Cato had despised since his youth, yet Cato attempted to make his name by returning his faction to its pure republican roots.

In 63 BC, he was elected tribune of the plebs for the following year. He helped the consul, Cicero, deal with the Catiline conspiracy. Lucius Sergius Catilina, a noble patrician, led a rebellion against the state, raising an army in Etruria. 

When Cicero discovered a plot against the consuls and other magistrates in Rome, he arrested the conspirators. Cicero proposed to execute them without trial, which would have been legal under the "". In the Senate's discussion, Julius Caesar agreed the conspirators were guilty, but argued for distributing them among Italian cities "for safekeeping". In contrast, Cato argued that capital punishment was necessary to deter treason: it was folly to wait for the test of the conspirators' guilt. Convinced by Cato's argument, the Senate approved Cicero's proposal, and the conspirators were executed. Most of Catilina's army quit the field, much as Cato had predicted.

Cato was a supporter of Pompey, and continued the fight after Pompey was dead. The anti-Caesar forces, known as the Optimates were reinforced by forces from local rulers. They numbered about eight legions (40.000 men) plus sixty elephants. Caesar defeated the Optimates at the Battle of Thapsus in modern Tunisia, North Africa. Cato did not actually take part in the battle, which was led by a colleague, and committed suicide after the defeat. Roughly 10,000 enemy soldiers wanted to surrender to Caesar, but were instead slaughtered by Caesar's army. This was unusual for Caesar, who was known as a merciful victor. No explanation of this is known.

The Mummy (1932 movie)

The Mummy is a 1932 horror movie. It was directed by Karl Freund. It stars Boris Karloff as The Mummy, Zita Johann, David Manners, and Edward Van Sloan. The movie is about an Egyptian mummy that returns to life to stalk a woman who is the reincarnation of his lost love.

Sodium monofluoroacetate

Sodium fluoroacetate is a chemical compound that is a poison for many organisms. Pesticides used kill rodents sometimes contain Sodium monofluoroacetate. Sometimes the chemical substance is used as a marker for cancer cells in Positron emission tomography. TO act as a marker, only very small quantities of a substance are needed. For this reason, the toxicity of Sodium fluoroacetate is not a problem.

Marking knife

A marking knife is a knife used in woodworking. It is used to mark a line that is to be followed by a saw or chisel when cutting the wood.

Starburst galaxy

A starburst galaxy is a galaxy with a very high rate of star formation. The rate of star formation is so large that the galaxy will quickly use all of its gas reservoir (from which the stars are made). 

So, the starburst nature of a galaxy is a short phase in a galaxy's evolution, just tens of millions of years. Most starburst galaxies are in the midst of a galaxy merger or at least close encounter with another galaxy. 

Studying nearby starburst galaxies can help us explore the history of galaxy formation and evolution. Many very distant galaxies seen, for example, in the Hubble Deep Field are known to be starbursts, but they are too far away to be studied in any detail. Looking at nearby examples give us an idea of what was happening in the early universe. The light we see from distant galaxies left them when the universe was much younger (see redshift). 

Starburst galaxies seem to be quite rare in our local universe, and are more common further away. This suggests there were more of them billions of years ago. All galaxies were closer together then, and therefore more likely to be influenced by each other's gravity. More frequent encounters produced more starbursts as galactic forms evolved with the expanding universe.

These include:

The cricket teams of Bangladesh and England have played against each other in One Day Internationalss since 2000. They have met on 15 occasions. England is most successful with 13 victories, Bangladesh have won in only 2 games.



Messier 82

Messier 82 (also known as NGC 3034, Cigar galaxy or M82) is the nearby starburst galaxy about 12 million light years away in the constellation Ursa Major. It is five times brighter than the whole Milky Way and one hundred times brighter than our galaxy's center.

In 2005, the Hubble Space Telescope revealed 197 young massive clusters in the starburst core. The average mass of these clusters is around 2 "M", hence the starburst core is a very energetic and high-density environment. Throughout the galaxy's center, young stars are being born 10 times faster than they are inside our entire Milky Way Galaxy.

M82 is being physically affected by its larger neighbor, nearby spiral M81. Tidal forces caused by gravity have deformed M82, a process that started about 100 million years ago. This interaction has caused star formation to increase tenfold compared to "normal" galaxies.

Recently, M82 has undergone at least one tidal encounter with M81. This resulted in a large amount of gas being funnelled into the galaxy's core over the last 200 million years (myr). The most recent such encounter is thought to have happened around 2–5 years ago and resulted in a concentrated starburst together with a marked peak in the cluster age distribution. This starburst ran for up to ~50 myr at a rate of ~10 "M" per year. Two subsequent starbursts followed, the last of which (~4–6 myr ago) may have formed the core star clusters.

In April 2010, radio astronomers at the Jodrell Bank Observatory of the University of Manchester reported an unknown object in M82. The object started sending out radio waves, and the emission did not look like anything seen anywhere in the universe before.
There have been several theories about the nature of this unknown object, but currently no theory entirely fits the observed data. The object is several arcseconds from the center of M82. It has an apparent motion of four times the speed of light relative to the galaxy centre.

List of One Day International cricket matches played by Bangladesh and Scotland

The cricket teams of Bangladesh and Scotland have played against each other in One Day Internationals since 1999. They have met on 4 occasions. Bangladesh is most successful with 3 victories while Scotland has not won any games. The other game was abandoned without a ball played.




Baby boom galaxy

The Baby boom galaxy is a starburst galaxy 12.2 billion light years away.

It was discovered by NASA's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology. The galaxy is the new record holder for the brightest starburst galaxy in the very distant universe, its brightness being a measure of its extreme star-formation rate.

The Baby boom galaxy has been called "the extreme stellar machine" because it is seen producing stars at a surprising rate of up to 4,000 per year. Our Milky Way galaxy turns out an average of just 10 stars per year.

At its rate, the galaxy needs only 50 million years to grow into an equivalent of the most massive galaxy ever observed.

The discovery challenges the accepted model for galaxy formation. This has most galaxies slowly bulking up by absorbing pieces of other galaxies, rather than growing internally. Another unusual aspect is the fact that scientists are observing this galaxy at a time when the universe was only a little over 1.4 billion years old. Evidently, the galaxy was doing this when the universe was still in its infancy.

"This galaxy is undergoing a major baby boom, producing most of its stars all at once", said Peter Capak of NASA's Spitzer Science Center. To that, the principal investigator of the Cosmic Evolution Surveyor, Nick Scoville of Caltech responded:
"We may be witnessing, for the first time, the formation of one of the most massive elliptical galaxies in the universe".

The different colors in the figure of the Baby boom galaxy refers to different wavelengths. The red color refers to new born stars in the galaxy. Interfered lights are giving off as the warm dust is heated by the stars. 

Pontic Greek genocide

The Pontic Greek genocide was the killing of all Greek people who lived in the Pontus region of Ottoman Empire. This is the northeast of modern Turkey. The genocide took place between 1914 and 1923. It happened when the Young Turks and Kemalists killed or deported Pontians through the Syrian desert. The estimates of the number of people that were killed vary. Most historians say between 350,000 and 353,000 were effected.

The genocide ended with deportation of survivors to Greece. This happened during the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923. The agreement to allow this exchange of people wassigned after the Second Greco-Turkish War.

The Pontic genocide is part of the Greek genocide. It is often seen as separate because of the geographic separation of Pontus and political and historical features. 
Since 700 BC, Pontic Greeks lived near the southern coast of the Black Sea in the Pontus region. They had a strong culture with many important Greek philosophers and writers. In the 11th century, the Turks started moving to central Anatolia, This area is now Turkey. They moved into the Pontus region. Under the Byzantine Empire (395 CE-1453), the two groups got along well with each other.

However, from the start of the Ottoman Empire (1299-1922), the Pontic Greeks were not equal to the rest of the population because they were a Christian minority in a Muslim Empire. Many Christian Greeks had better education and a higher economic position in the empire. This made many Muslims angry. Religion was a sign of loyalty in the Ottoman Empire. But most Pontics did not want to change their religion to Islam. That is why they were seen as a danger to the empire.

The Young Turk Revolution was the event that changed the lives of Pontic Greeks in Anatolia. The political idea of the Young Turks movement was to "turkify" the Ottoman Empire. They wanted to bring together everyone who shared the same language, history and culture. This also meant that everyone who was not part of this group would have to leave. The people in the Ottoman Empire were scared that Christian groups like the Pontic Greeks would try to separate the Muslim Empire. This would mean that they would lose control and power over their areas. Because of this they started the genocide - to remove everyone who was not Turkish from Anatolia.

In the time between 1914-1923, about 353,000 Pontic Greeks were killed and 1.5 million were send into exile, meaning they were forced to leave their homes. The genocide came in different forms and had two main phases: Young Turk and Kemalist.

Pontic Greek men between 20 and 50 were sent to do slave work in working groups and camps of the military ("Amele Tabourou"). They were supposed to free the ways and open roads for Turkish armies all over Turkey. Many Pontic men died because they had to work a lot and there was not enough water and food for everyone. In the time between 1914-1918, 88 Pontic Greek villages were burnt down, women and girls were raped, houses were robbed and people murdered. 100,000 Pontic Greeks were killed and about 255.000 were forced to leave.

After World War I, the Ottoman Empire and Great Britain signed the Armistice of Mudros. This agreement allowed Greek survivors of the War to go back to their homes in Anatolia. However, most of their homes were destroyed and it was not safe for them to stay there. The armistice also allowed Greece to invade in Turkey if they felt like they needed to protect the Greeks in Anatolia. This is why Greece came to the city of Smyrna on May 15, 1919 and started the Second Greco-Turkish War.

The second phase of the Pontic Greek genocide took place during the Second Greco-Turkish War. It was larger by scale, than the first one, and resulted in complete dissappearance of Greeks in area.

Turks feared the permanent occupation and Hellenization of parts of Anatolia, with Ionia falling under direct Athenian governance, and separatism and revolt by Ottoman Greeks resulting in the establishment of Pontic state on the Black Sea. This concerns increased drastically after Greek landing in Smyrna on 15th of May and became one of main reasons (and justifications) for final stage of the genocide. In late May 1919, Kemal, having just arrived in Samsun, informed Constantinople that since the Armistice "forty guerilla" bands, "in an organized program", were killing Turks in order to "establish a Pontus state". But the reality was different. All this separatist hubbub resulted in almost no acts of organized rebellion and very little anti-Turk actions. Most Ottoman Greeks, in the Pontus as elsewhere in Anatolia, remained unmoved by ethnic-nationalist appeals. An American diplomat who toured the major Pontic cities in summer 1919 reported, "many of the most influential and rational Greeks... In Trebizond view this policy [of separatism] with disfavor.". The local Greek Archbishop, Chrysantonos, was also opposed. Why Ottoman Greeks by and large distanced themselves from the pan-Hellenic national message, and certainly failed to act on it, is unclear. Perhaps it was matter of poorly developed political consciousness; perhaps it was due to the centuries-long tradition of submissiveness to Islamic hegemony. Also they feared massacre - as had just befallen Armenians. Demographic realities assuredly contributed: Turks predominate in Pontus, as in Anatolia in general - and Pontic Greeks knew it, whatever their spokesmen sometimes said.
A few days after the war started, on May 19, M. Kemal Atatürk was ordered to go to Samsun, which is a city in in the Pontus region, to create order there. Instead, he brought more Turkish nationalists together and strengthened his tactics against the Pontic Greeks. Even more Greeks were kidnapped, killed, and tortured. Three hundred villages were destroyed and people were burnt alive in their homes.

Under the order of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Pontic Greeks were forced to leave their homes and had to go onto death marches through the Syrian desert. The Greeks walked for weeks, even months and many lost their lives because there was not enough food, water or protection. They were joined by two violent groups: The "Teşkilât-ı Mahsusa," which was a secret police of the Ministry of War under the Ottoman Empire, and "Çetes", who were organized criminals. Both groups created even worse conditions for the Pontic Greeks.

By early 1920 the Kemalist policy of intimidating Greeks into flight was in full swing. Nationalist army officers near Samsun toured the villages saying that "the Christians [were] the cause of the [Allied] occupation of Constantinople and advocated their extermination". At Unye and Fatsa, Turks posted placards, blaming the Christians "for all their troubles". Kemalists arrested and exiled to Ankara Polycacpos, the Greek bishop of mixed town Ordu. Turks walked arout the town fully armed, except when Allied ship was in port. "They are on their good behavior until the ships leave... Christians feared to venture out of town". In Samsun Nationalists, stressing "the religious side of the question", inflamed Turkish population "by preaching a Holy War... The Greeks are accused of violenting Turkish women, and of destroying the Holy Tombs of Sheikhs at Broussa and other captured towns". Nationalist members of Kemal's parliament in Ankara proposed a law calling for the deportation of all Christians from the Black Sea area. But no such law was passed, because Kemal preferred less publicized methods at that time. Here and there, there were fatalities. In Domuz-Dere seven Greek charcoal-sellers and two children were murdered. At Gelebek station (Hackiri), in April, some 500 Christians were reportedly murdered by irregulars.

Organized atrocities began in March 1920 in Izmit and in September 1920 in Cappadocia, but not in Pontus yet. They eliminated illusions about Nationalist policy towards Greek (and Christian in general) minority and future of Pontians.

The full-scale campaign in Pontus began in March 1921. It may have been precipitated by the launch of the large Greek spring offensive, which began on the 23th. The leader of the Turkish campaign was General Nurredin Pasha, a killer so ruthless that in January 1922 he was brought up by his own government on charges for "the mal-execution of his orders". Kemalists claimed that they were "eradicating rebellion", Greeks were massacring Turks, the Greek Black Sea fleet was periodically bombarding coastal towns, and Pontic Greeks had joined the Greek army. Western observers uniformly asserted that there was no Pontic "rebellion", either underway or in preparation. Turks and their defenders have also sought cover by pointing to the arrival in the Black Sea in summer 1921 of a Greek naval squadron, which stopped Turkish ships, took passengers prisoner, and later lightly shelled Inebolu. This may indeed have hastened the deportation process, but it wasn't the cause of the campaign, which was launched weeks before. As Count Schmeccia of the firm Lloyd Triestino in Samsun, and previously a representative of the Italian High Commission, said, the Inebolu bombardment, which produced no casualties, was merely a Turkish "excuse for the massacres".

In any event, much other evidence points to Ankara's planning for that summer's destruction of the Greek communities. An American report refers to a July 2 order from Ankara requiring deportation of all "adult male" Christians "throughout the interior of Anatolia" , not merely in the Pontus. Another report indicates that two weeks later Ankara ordered the "immediate deportation of all Ottoman Greeks", meaning women, children, and the eldery as well. At the beginning of August, the mutessarif of Bafra told a visiting American naval officer that the deportation "of all remaining Greeks, including women and children, had been ordered by Angora". That order was apparently reinforced by another, from Nurredin Pasha, who instructed a local governor "to proceed with all dispatch to carry out the orders which had been given him or that he would shortly cease to be mutassarif". The American officer concluded that this was "part of an official plan which contemplates extermination of the Greeks". There may not have been an "open and avowed policy of extermination", but there was evidence of a "popular policy" aiming at "Turkey for the Turks", as one missionary put it.

Be that as it may, the largescale massacres and deportations began already in the spring, with the rural Greek communities. In the villages of Black Sea's Duzce (Kurtsuyu) kaza, "many old men and women [were] burnt alive". Turks also attacked swaths of villages around Alacam, Bafra, and Carsamba and in the interior as far as Havza and Visirkopru. They took paints to make sure that there were no American witnesses. Missionaries were not allowed out of Samsun, the regional missionary center. But survivors reached the town and told their stories. American naval officers reported that the campaign was "under strict control of the military", "directed by high authority - probably Angora [Ankara]",and carried out, at least in part, by soldiers. A purported eyewitness stated that villagers around Bafra were subjected to "incendiarism, shooting, slaying, hanging and outranging" and that the villages were "turned to heaps of ruins". The American officers quoted an American missionary to the effect that about a hundred Greek villages south of Bafra had been destroyed. Villagers were being killed and "the priests...crucified".

By summer, the campaign reached towns. In Bafra, it kicked off with an ancient ploy, according to the Greek Patriarchate: Greek notables were invited to a dinner party at the house of Efrem Aga, arrested, and murdered. Turks then rounded up and massacred young Greek men. On June 5 Bafra was sorrounded by gendarmes, brigands, and Turkish troops - "a special corps...formed for the purpose of exterminating the Greek element" - who demanded that the men give themselves up. Some hid. Turks then searched the houses, pillaging and violating "the prettiest and best bred" women. Men were marched off, escorted by convoys. The first headed for nearby village of Blezli. Seven Bafra priests were axed to death and the rest of men were killed thereafter. One, Nicholas Jordanoglon, gave Turks 300 Turkish lira for the privilege of being shot rather than batchered with an axe or bayonet. Another 500 men, from the second convoy, were reportedly burnt alive in the church in Selamelik. And another 680 were murdered in the church at Kavdje-son. Five convoys left Bafra. At least two, according to the Greek representative to the League of Nations, were shot up by their escorts near Kavak Gorge, killing at least 900. Survivors were sent naked, "like wandering spirits", to Malaya, Charnout, Mamuret, and Alpistan. Western report claimed 1300 Greeks were murdered in the gorge on August 15 or 16. Ankara's government claimed those dead at Kavak had been killed justifiably in battle, after "Greek bands" allegedly attacked Turks. On August 8 Turks collected Bafran women and girls, "stripped and violated them and by torture compelled many to adopt Mohammedanism". Those who refused conversation were led off "to different unknown places, where many died on the way...and children were slaughtered". Some 6000 Greek women and children were deported from Bafra around August 31 and further 2500 on September 19. The only Greeks allowed to stay were the sick people who paid bribes.

On May 25, 1922, the military base in Constantinople reached out to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Greece. They informed them about what was happening in the Pontus region. By that time, there were almost no Pontic Greeks left in that area.

The genocide ended with the the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. It was signed by Greece and Tukey and led to a trade of people between these two countries. Almost 190.000 Greeks were send from the Ottoman Empire to Greece and about 350.000 Muslims were brought from Greece to the Ottoman Empire. With that, no more Christian Greeks were left in the Ottoman Empire.

On December 16th, 2007, the Pontic Greek Genocide was officially recognized by the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS). Not many people know and talk about the Genocide on Pontic Greeks. This is because of the Armenian Genocide, which happened around the same time. On February 24th, 1994 the Greek parliament officially recognized the Genocide and declared the 19th of May as the national day of remembrance. Until now, Turkey has not recognized the Genocide and did not make a statement about what happened 100 years ago in Anatolia. Many pro-Turkish scholars even say that there is not enough proof that the Young Turks wanted to start a genocide in the first place.

The Genocide was recognized by Sweden in 2010 and the Netherlands and Armenia in 2015.

Kamoya Kimeu

Kamoya Kimeu (born c. 1940), a Kamba tribesman, is one of the world's most successful fossil collectors. With paleontologists Meave Leakey and Richard Leakey, he found some of the most significant paleoanthropological discoveries. Kimeu found a "Homo habilis" skull known as KNM ER 1813, and an almost complete "Homo erectus" skeleton known as Turkana Boy or Nariokotome boy. He has two fossil primates named after him: "Kamoyapithecus hamiltoni" and "Cercopithecoides kimeui".

Kimeu began to work in paleoanthropology as a labourer for Louis Leakey and Mary Leakey in the 1950s. He was recruited for Mary Leakey's team when she took over as head of excavations at Olduvai. She preferred to hire Kamba men rather than Kikuyu, whom Louis preferred. In 1963 he joined with Richard Leakey's expeditions, accompanying him to the Omo River and Lake Rudolf (now Lake Turkana) in 1967. 

He quickly became Richard Leakey's right-hand man, controlling field operations in Leakey's absence. In 1977 he became the National Museums of Kenya's curator for all prehistoric sites in Kenya. Kimeu was awarded the National Geographic Society's LaGorce Medal by the US President Ronald Reagan in a ceremony at the White House.



John Turner (Mayflower passenger)

John Turner (c.1590 – winter of 1620/21) was a passenger on the historic "Mayflower" voyage with his two sons. Turner was also one of the signers of the Mayflower Compact.

Turner probably came from Great Yarmouth in the county Norfolk, where there were several Turner families at that time.

Turner was a member of the Separatist church. That was a religion that was not allowed in England.

Turner was one the original group who moved to Leiden Holland in 1610 to escape religious persecution with William Bradford and William Brewster. Turner was a merchant and a (political official) of Leiden. 

Many of these people lived in Middelburg, Holland. This is located in Zeeland. Turner also delivered mail to the Separatists from their family and friends in England. Turner also brought cargoes of English pewter from London to Holland. He also carried letters between people in Leiden and London. On June 10, 1620, Turner carried information to the congregation on the progress of their planned trip to the New World.

According to William Bradford, John Turner traveled on the "Mayflower" with his two sons. 
Turner left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" reached land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. John Turner signed the Mayflower Compact. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.

After they landed, Turner was part of the group who went out on exploratory trips to look for permanent places to live. Turner was one of the "Mayflower" passengers who would make first contact with the Indians.

Turner also had a daughter Elizabeth, who stayed in Leiden. She would have been one year old. Elizabeth Turner married and travelled to New England before October 1635. She joined the Salen Church.

Turner and his sons died sometime in the winter of 1620/21. Turner was buried in Cole's Hill Burial Ground in Plymouth, presumably in an unmarked grave as with most "Mayflower" passengers who died in that first winter. Their names are all on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb on Coles Hill as “John Turner and two sons.”

Christopher Martin

Christopher Martin (15821621) was a merchant by trade. He along with his family traveled on the "Mayflower" in 1620.

Martin, wife Mary, son Nathaniel and step-son Solomon all came from Billericay in Essex England.

The family did not believe in the Church of England. In 1612, Martin and his wife would not take Holy Communion. Another time, Nathaniel and Solomon made the Church Vicar angry with during a service. Martin got into trouble because he would not give church officials the financial accounts he kept.

Martin and his family joined a Separatist church. They all wanted to go to the New World. Martin sold his property and bought passage on the ship.

The people asked Martin to help them by buying supplies. He did not spent the money wisely. He purchased things like beer, wine, salted beef and pork, dried peas, fishing supplies, muskets, armor, clothing, tools, and other things to trade with the Native Americans. One thing he purchased, the screw-jack, would be very useful to keep the "Mayflower" from sinking.

There were two ships going to Virginia Colony, the "Speedwell" and the "Mayflower". Martin was assigned to be the leader of the passengers on the "Speedwell" but the ship needed repairs. A fellow passenger and official of the trip, Robert Cushman said, that Martin will not listen to them, nor allow them to go ashore in case they should run away. Some of the passengers quit the voyage to return to London and lost much or all of their money. Others boarded the "Mayflower" which became very crowded.

Christopher Martin left on "Mayflower" in company with his wife Mary, his servant John Langmore and his stepson Solomon Prower. Nathaniel Martin stayed in England.

The Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" spotted land. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor. They landed on 21 November. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. Christopher Martin signed the Mayflower Compact. His step-son and his servant were too young to sign.
When the "Mayflower" was docked in the Harbor, Martin and other men went to land to find a place where they all could live.

In the winter of 1621 Martin, his wife, son and servant became ill and died.

Martin and his wife Mary were buried in the Cole's Hill Burial Ground, Plymouth.

There is a plaque in the United Reform Church in England to honor the "Mayflower" passengers. The plaque names Christopher Martin, Marie (Mary) Martin, Solomon Prower and John Langerman.

Cycle of abuse

Cycle of abuse is the name of a theory that was developed to explain certain patterns in an abusive relationship, and in domestic violence. Lenore Walker developed the theory in the 1970s, after she had observed that there is a pattern that repeats in such relationships:
Walker's cycle of abuse theory was regarded as a revolutionary and important concept in the study of abuse and interpersonal violence. However, researchers have occasionally criticised Walker's methodology, preconceptions or findings.

Cockburn Town

Cockburn Town is the capital city of the Turks and Caicos Islands.

Cockburn Town is in the Grand Turk Island, the largest island in the Turks Islands archipelago. Historic 18th and 19th century Bermudian architecture can be seen on Duke and Front Streets in the town. The town is known for its long, narrow streets and old street lamps.

The closest area where ships can come near the city is Hawk's Nest Anchorage, which, though protected from the wind, should only be entered in good light because of reefs near the entrance.

The seat of government ever since 1766, Cockburn Town was the first permanent settlement on any of the islands, founded in 1681 by salt collectors who arrived in the Turks and Caicos Islands. The city supposedly lies on the place where Juan Ponce de León first landed on the island.

Cockburn Town is home to the Turks & Caicos National Museum, which is housed in the colonial-era Guinep House, on Front Street. The house is believed to be over 180 years old and is named after the large and old Guinep tree that is in front of the building. The site was donated to the Museum in 1990.

Some of the exhibits detail the history of the Lucayans (the original people of the islands), the Space Race, Turks and Caicos postage stamps, slavery and the history of the slave trade, the sisal and salt industries, royal events, as well as a general history of the islands. The museum also maintains a garden, which is adjacent to the Guinep House.

Also of interest are the museum's research projects, including its "Message in a Bottle" Project, recording nearly 40 years' worth of messages found in bottles on the beaches of Grand Turk.

Velasco Ibarra traveled through several Latin American countries, including Peru, and restored Ecuador's global image. His first presidency began on September 1, 1934, but he was ousted in August 1935 by the military.

In May 1944, because of the May 28 "Glorious Revolution", he was named Supreme Chief of the Republic and was later named Constitutional President by the Constituent Assembly. In August 1947, he was again deposed by the military. Three defense ministers perpetuated the coup against Velasco Ibarra; among them was minister Mancheno, who later was his successor.

In 1952, he again won the presidential election, and began his third term as president on September 1, 1952. This time, he served his entire term, which ended on August 31, 1956. His third term was a time of progress for Ecuador: 311 schools were constructed, with another 104 in progress. More than 1359 km of roads were constructed, and 1057 km more were improved.

In 1960, he was elected president for the fourth time and was removed on November 7, 1961. In 1960, he nullified the Rio de Janeiro Protocol, which led to conflicts between Ecuador and Peru, including Paquisha in 1981 and the War of El Cenepa in 1995.

Finally, in 1968 Velasco Ibarra won the presidency for a fifth time. This government ended abruptly on February 15, 1972, when once more he was deposed in a bloodless coup, which brought General Guillermo Rodríguez Lara to power. In total, Velasco Ibarra governed nearly 13 years, making him the longest-serving president in Ecuadorian history.

Edward Winslow

Edward Winslow (1595 – May 8, 1655) traveled on the "Mayflower" in 1620 so he could practice his own religion which was not allowed in England. Winslow helped to organize the voyage to the New World and was a leader at Plymouth Colony. He signed the Mayflower Compact

Edward Winslow was born in Droitwich, Worcestershire England. His parents were Edward and Magdalene Winslow. In 1613 Winslow was apprenticed to a London printer. Winslow became a Separatist which was a religion that did not believe in the Church of England.

It was illegal to be a Separatist in England, so in 1617 Edward Winslow moved to Leiden, Netherlands where he worked with William Brewster. They started to print religious booklets which were critical of the English king and his bishops. The English King ordered Brewster’s arrest, and he was forced to hide.

The Separatists were planning to move to America and they need leaders to plan the voyage. Thomas Weston helped them by providing the ship "Mayflower" for their journey. Winslow's brother Gilbert and family servant George Soule and a youth, Elias Story went with him. Elinor (Ellen) More, a girl of eight years, also went with them Elinor died in the winter of 1620 with only one brother Richard More surviving.

Edward Winslow left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" spotted land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. Winslow signed the Mayflower Compact. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.

The men went to land to explore a place where they all could live. One of the missions included William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish, Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edwary Doty. Bradford wrote that they set off in freezing weather and many of the men were ill. He said that "when the set sail the salt spray froze on their coats, as
if they had been glazed". Of this group Hopkins was the most experienced, having seen Native Americans during his time at Jamestown. During their trip they saw Native Americans who were cutting up a large whale. When the Indians saw the men they ran away. 

Plymouth Colony lost over half of its population because of sickness, lack of proper food and the cold winter. With the help of friendly Native Americans, they learned to grow food. In 1621, Winslow and the others attended what would have the first Thanksgiving.
The next year they were able to load the ship "Fortune" with furs and other supplies. This was to pay the men would helped pay for the trip to the New World. On the return trip, the "Mayflower" was attacked by the French and all the cargo was taken.

On February 21, 1621, William White died leaving a widow, Susanna, and two sons, Resolved and Peregrine. Edward Winslow had lost his wife Elizabeth on March 24, 1621. In 1621, Edward Winslow and Susanna White became the first couple to marry in Plymouth Colony. They had 5 children: A (child) who died young, Edward Winslow, Josiah Winslow and Elizabeth. Josiah became the 13th Governor of Plymouth Colony.
Winslow had a friendship with native leader Massasoit. These Native Americans were friendly and helped the Pilgrims. In January 1629 a fishing and trading post opened up on the Kennebec River near Plymouth Colony. Isaac Allerton also opened his own trading post there and this caused problems between the two men.

In 1632, Winslow explored the Connecticut River. 

Winslow was a diplomat and a spokesperson for the Pilgrims with English officials. Winslow was a governor in 1634, 1636 and 1644 and was a member of the United Colonies of New England. This was a military group which protected the pilgrims against unfriendly Native Americans.

England had a civil war in the 1640s. Some pilgrims returned to fight against the King. In 1646, Winslow began working for Oliver Cromwell. Winslow never returned to Plymouth Colony.

In 1654, Winslow fought against the Spanish in the West Indies. They won the battle but Winslow became ill and died from yellow fever. He was buried at sea. Winslow Cemetery in Marshfield, Massachusetts has a stone monument which lists the names of the Winslow family. There is another memorial stone w/plaque stating "Edward Winslow, Founder of Marshfield". Edward Winslow's first wife Elizabeth Barker Winslow was buried in 1621 in the Cole's Hill Burial Ground, Plymouth, Massachusetts.

Saturnalia tupiniquim

Saturnalia is an extinct genus of basal prosauropod dinosaur from the Triassic of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. The deposits are dated to the early Upper Triassic, about 225 million years ago (mya). The dinosaur grew to about 1.5 meters (5 ft) long.

"Saturnalia" is primitive, and its mixture of characteristics, has made it difficult to classify. It is one of the oldest true dinosaurs yet found.

The first (1999) description of the genus assigned it to the Sauropodomorpha. However, in a 2003 paper, Langer noted that features of its skull and hand were more similar to the sister group of sauropodomorphs, the theropods. Also that "Saturnalia" could be a member of the sauropodomorph "stem-lineage", rather than a true member of that group. 

José Bonaparte and colleagues, in a 2007 study, found "Saturnalia" to be very similar to the primitive saurischian "Guaibasaurus". Bonaparte placed the two in the same family, Guaibasauridae. Like Langer, Bonaparte found that these forms may have been primitive sauropodomorphs, or an assemblage of forms close to the common ancestor of the sauropodomorphs and theropods. Overall, Bonaparte found that both "Saturnalia" and "Guaibasaurus" were more theropod-like than prosauropod-like. 

However, all more recent cladistic analyses found it to be a very basal sauropodomorph,

Massasoit (c. 15811661),
was the Native American leader of the Wampanoag and "Massasoit" tribes. His name means "Great Leader".

Massasoit was born in a Pokanoket village at the site of today's Rhode Island. His village was near a spring of water which is named after him. He was liked by seven leaders. In March 1621, a Native American named Samoset entered Plymouth Colony and said to the Pilgrims in English, "Welcome Englishmen". He had learned some words from the English fishermen and traders that had visited his tribe. He said he was sent by Massasoit, “the greatest leader of the country.” After a few days, Massasoit came in person and was received with great friendship. 

Massasoit made a treaty with the Pilgrims. They promised to protect each other against unfriendly Native Americans. They promised not to hurt each other. They also promised to help each other as friends. Massasoit told the pilgrims that there was much sickness where the colonist were now living and that many had died. The treaty was kept as long as Massasoit lived.

Massasoit helped the people of Plymouth Colony in many ways, including how to plant corn. He became friends with the all of the colonial leaders.

During this time, Massasoit had five children. His oldest son, "Moanam" or Wamsutta, died within a year after his father, and his brother Metacom (Philip) became chief in 1662.

There was some bad feeling for a time when the Plymouth leaders refused to give up Squanto to Massasoit. He believe that Squanto had betrayed him. This was settled when Edward Winslow visited him in March 1623. Massasoit was ill and Winslow took care of him. After he got better, Massasoit said the English are my friends and love me. He also said that while he lives he would never forget the kindness they have showed me."

The Wampanoag and the English maintained a friendship until Massasoit's death. During this time, Massasoit sold lands to the English that they needed. When Roger Williams, was sent away from the Massachusetts colony, he spent many weeks with Massasoit. Massasoit was friendly and honest and always kept his word. He warned the pilgrims of any Native Americans who were not their friends.

Massasoit died as early as 1660. When he died, his son Wamsutta became chief. When Wamsutta died Metacom (Philip) took his place. Of Massasoit's five children, the only child to survive King Philip's War in 1676 was his daughter, Amie, wife of Tispaquin.

With this Shout out, Bailey would pull the taxi over and the contestant would ask someone on the street for help.

When the taxi had to stop at a red light and the contestant had at least $200, a "Red Light Challenge" was played. A question was asked that had more than one correct answer. The contestant had 30 seconds to give all of the correct answers to the question. If the contestant does so, $250 was added to their prize pool. If the 30 second time limit runs out, the contestant did not get a strike. In the early seasons, games had only one Red Light Challenge. Starting in the fourth season, some games had more than one. The second was played if the contestant had at least $1,000 in their prize pool.

If the contestant got to where they wanted to go without getting three strikes, they had a choice: they could leave the taxi and keep the money in their prize pool or they could risk it on a "Video Bonus" question. If they decided to play the Video Bonus question, a video clip was played and they were asked a question based on the clip. If the contestant answered correctly, their prize pool was doubled. If they gave a wrong answer, they lost all of their prize.

Starting in the fourth season, some games were "Double Ride" games. In these games, the value for a correct answer was doubled. The first four questions were worth $100, the next four were worth $200 and questions after were worth $400. The Red Light Challenge was worth $500.

In 2007, a spin-off, "Cash Cab: After Dark", started. Contestants were picked up near or after sunset. The questions were worth double the amount of "Cash Cab." The question were also harder.

Another spin-off, "Cash Cab: Chicago", started during the sixth season of "Cash Cab". It was hosted by Beth Melewski. This series used the same rules as the New York "Cash Cab". It ended after one season.

The series was also broadcast on the Discovery Channel from 2017 until 2018. A version of the program was broadcast from 2019 until 2020 on Bravo.

Eyespot

An eyespot is a simple organ in biology used to detect light. It may be called an ocellus, or pigment pit. They are quite common in small, simple invertebrates, such as "Planaria". They do not have lenses or any means of focussing. Therefore, they can sense light from dark, but do not give the animal a visual scene as our eyes do.

In many simple animals the eyespot senses light with a pigment molecule called an opsin. Then a nerve fibre goes from the eyespot to the simple nervous system. This allows the animal to move in response to (for example) a shadow passing over it.

Eyespots also occur in single-celled protists like "Euglena" and "Chlamydomonas", where it is connected to the flagellum. This allows the information from the light patch to influence the cells's movement.

The first fossils of eyes that have been found to date are from the early Cambrian period (about 540 million years ago). This period saw a burst of apparently rapid evolution, called the "Cambrian explosion". One idea is that the evolution of eyes started an arms race which led to a rapid spate of evolution. Much earlier than this organisms would have used light spots for light sensitivity, but did not have a visual scene for rapid navigation.

Managed motorway

Managed motorways in the United Kingdom are motorways which use active traffic management. Their aim is to increase traffic capacity at times of peak traffic flow. They use variable speed limits and hard shoulder running at busy times. A "hard shoulder" is an inner lane which in normal times is only used for emergencies.

Active traffic management was first used in 2005. The system is now in operation on sections of the M1, M4, M6, and M42, and there are proposals for its use on sections of the M5, M25, M60 and M62. 

Benefits include smoother traffic flows, more reliable journey times, fewer road traffic collisions, and reduced noise and harmful vehicle emissions. Where only variable speed limits are used, it is called a controlled motorway.

Mooreana trichoneura

Mooreana trichoneura is commonly known as the 'yellow flat'. It is a butterfly belonging to the family Hesperiidae. It has a wingspan of 32-36mm. Butterflies like this are called 'flats' because they fly quickly and usually rest on the underside of a leaf with their wings open flat.

Its host plant is "Mallotus paniculatus", in the spurge family Euphorbiaceae. The yellow flat is usually found in lowland forests up to 833m (2500ft).

The yellow flat has a wide distribution. It ranges from India to Thailand to Malaysia and can even be found in the Philippines. In the 4th quarter of 2012, it was discovered in Singapore.

Kiddush

Kiddush () is a blessing said by Jews at the start of Shabbat and holiday meals. The term is also used to refer to a light meal served in the synagogue after the long Shabbat and holiday morning prayers. The word comes from a Hebrew root meaning "holy".

There are two versions of the Ten Commandments in the Bible. These versions use different words. The version in Exodus says "Remember Shabbat to keep it holy." The version in Deuteronomy says "Guard Shabbat to keep it holy." Jewish custom says that "remember" means to "celebrate" Shabbat. "Guard" means "resting"—not working or doing business.

There are many things Jews do to celebrate Shabbat [see Shabbat (Celebrating Shabbat)]. The minimum way to celebrate is to say the blessing "Blessed are You, God, Who makes Shabbat holy." The Talmud adds that the blessing should be said with a cup of wine. This is because wine makes people feel happy. Because of this, the Friday evening meal in a Jewish home starts with a ceremony to say this blessing over a cup of wine.

In traditional homes, the blessing is said in the Hebrew language. This is a Simple English translation of the blessing. Words in italics "like this" are added to explain the Hebrew.

There is a different version of Kiddush for the Shabbat morning (or noon) meal. This ceremony makes the meal feel more special. 

For the morning Kiddush, a person says verses from the Torah about Shabbat. These verses are usually from and . The person ends with the same blessing over the wine:
Most Jews do not say Kiddush at the third Shabbat meal. However, Maimonides ruled that they should do so. The text for this Kiddush includes . That verse is the source of the law to have three meals on Shabbat.

Kiddush is also said in the synagogue. This does not replace saying Kiddush at home before the meal.

Kiddush is said on these Jewish holidays: 
The holiday texts are different from the Shabbat texts. The blessings are said in the same way and at the same time of day as on Shabbat, but there are two differences:

Jews usually use a fancy cup for Kiddush. The most common material for this cup is silver. Other materials are also used. These include ceramic, glass and wood. The most important part of the custom is for the cup to be special and unusual in honor of the blessing.

Colony of Virginia

The Colony of Virginia (also known as Virginia Colony) was the first of thirteen colonies in North America. The English first tried to make the Roanoke Colony in 1584. A war delayed resupply until 1590. When the ships arrived, the colonists were gone. The decision to settle Jamestown again came from a group called the Virginia Company of London. Virginia was settled again in 1607 at Jamestown, this time successfully. The Virginia Company had its charter revoked in 1624 for not showing a profit. At that time the colony of Virginia became a crown colony. It became a British colony after 1707. It remained an English colony until the American Revolution. 

The name Virginia was first applied by Sir Walter Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth I in 1584. After the English Civil War in the mid 17th century, the Virginia Colony was nicknamed "The Old Dominion" by King Charles II. He gave Virginia colony the name for its loyalty to the crown during the era of the Commonwealth of England. When Virginia colony was first settled it was a huge geographic area that was England's claim on all of North America. After the United States was formed, the entire states of West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois, and portions of Ohio were all later created from the territory that was once known in the Colony of Virginia.

Cellular automaton

A cellular automaton is a model used in computer science and mathematics. The idea is to model a dynamic system by using a number of cells. Each cell has one of many possible states. With each "turn" or iteration the state of the current cell is determined by two things: its current state, and the states of the neighbouring cells. 

A very famous example of a cellular automaton is Conway's Game of Life. Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann first described cellular automata in the 1940s. Conway's Game of Life was first shown in the 1970s. 

Some things in nature happen because of cellular automata.

The patterns of certain seashells are made by natural cellular automata. Examples can be seen in the genera "Conus" and "Cymbiola". The pigment cells are in a narrow band on the shell's lip. Each cell secretes pigments based on what pigment cells around it are doing. The cell band leaves the colored pattern on the shell as it slowly grows. For example, the species "Conus textile" has a pattern that looks similar to Wolfram's rule 30 cellular automaton.

Plants control how much gas they have with a cellular automaton. Each stoma on the leaf acts as a cell.

Moving wave patterns on the skin of cephalopods can be simulated with a two-state, two-dimensional cellular automaton, each state corresponding to either an expanded or retracted chromatophore.

Threshold automata have been made to act similar to neurons. These can do complex things, such as recognition and learning.

Fibroblasts are similar to cellular automata. This is because each fibroblast only interacts with others next to it.

Coriaria ruscifolia

Coriaria ruscifolia are shrubs or small trees with bright red fruits like berries. The fruits and the leaves are very poisonous.

This species has many names in Latin America. Some of them are:

"Coriaria ruscifolia" was described for the first time by Linnaeus in 1753 in "Species Plantarum" (Vol. 2, page 1037), from a plant from Peru.

The species is divided in two subspecies:

Shrub up to 4 metres high. Dark green leaves on the top and pale gray on the underside. Flowers grouped in terminal inflorescences on lateral branches, sepals are green to red, small petals, yellow or red anthers. Fruits look like berries but they are small nuts (achenes). The fruits are covered by the petals.

The number of chromosomes is 40.

The plants of "C. ruscifolia" subsp. "microphylla" can fix nitrogen from the air because they have bacteria in their roots.

C. ruscifolia grows in the Americas and some Pacific Islands:

It is a very toxic plant. Fruits are hallucinogens exciting the nervous system. The leaves have tannin and serve for tanning (making leather out of skins). It is recommended as an ornamental.

In Chile, the fruits are used mixed with bread to kill mice and rats.


The Little Mermaid (statue)

The Little Mermaid () is a statue in Copenhagen, Denmark. It sits on a rock in the harbor. It was inspired by a performance of a ballet based on the fairy tale "The Little Mermaid" by Hans Christian Andersen. It is tall. Sculptor Edvard Eriksen created the bronze statue. It was presented to the public on 23 August 1913.

The statue was the idea of Carl Jacobsen, son of the founder of Carlsberg. He asked ballerina, Ellen Price of Copenhagen's Royal Theatre, to pose for the statue. Only the statue's head was modelled on Price. She did not agree to pose in the nude, so the sculptor's wife, Eline Eriksen, posed for the body.

The Little Mermaid has been the victim of vandalism many times since the 1960s. Her head has been cut off, and she has had paint poured over her several times. In September 2003, the statue was knocked off its base with explosives. The statue has always been repaired after such acts.

Hangman

Hangman is a paper-and-pencil guessing game played by two or more people. One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence, and the other players have to try and guess it. They do so by calling letters or numbers that they think are in the word. The word is shown as a row of dashes. If a guessing player gives a letter or number that is in the word, the other player writes the letter or number in the places that they are in the word. If the letter or number is not in the word, the other player draws a part of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark (a form of numeral used for counting). The game ends when:


The television game show "Wheel of Fortune" is based off of Hangman. It uses a roulette-style wheel that players spin for cash and prizes.

Battle of Majuba Hill

The Battle of Majuba Hill was the main battle of the First Boer War. It happened near Volksrust, South Africa on 27 February 1881.

Also the fire and movement tactics used by the Boers were years ahead of their time. This battle and two before it convinced the British of the Boers strength. During the Second Anglo-Boer War "Remember Majuba" became a rallying cry.

Some important British historians say that this defeat marked the beginning of the decline of the British Empire.

Thomas (name)

Thorp received his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1958, and worked at M.I.T. from 1959 to 1961. He was a professor of mathematics from 19611965 at New Mexico State University, and then joined the University of California, Irvine where he was a professor of mathematics from 1965 to 1977 and a professor of mathematics and finance from 1977 to 1982.

Since the late 1960s, Thorp has used his knowledge of probability and statistics in the stock market by discovering and exploiting a number of pricing in the securities markets. Thorp is currently the President of Edward O. Thorp & Associates, based in Newport Beach, CA. In May 1998, Thorp reported that his personal investments yielded an annualized 20 percent rate of return averaged over 28.5 years.

Hydrogenosome

A hydrogenosome is a membrane-enclosed organelle of some anaerobic ciliates, trichomonads, fungi and a few metazoa. The hydrogenosomes of trichomonads (the best studied) produce ATP by a complex metabolic cycle. Unlike mitochondria, this cycle does not use oxygen. It is thought that hydrogenosomes evolved from mitochondria; their structure is rather similar.

In 2010, scientists reported their discovery of the first known anaerobic metazoans with hydrogenosome-like organelles. These organisms were Loricifera living in sediments under deep-water brine pools like the L'Atalante basin. These brine pools are completely without any oxygen (anoxic).

Medullary ray

In botany, medullary rays (pith rays or wood rays) are sheets or ribbons of cells running from the inside of the plant to the outside. That is, they run at right angles to the xylem and phloem, which run vertically. While the plant is alive, these medullary cells are alive. They carry nutrients (sap) towards the surface of the tree.

In wood products the rays can be seen running perpendicular to the growth rings. If wood is cut into boards with the growth rings roughly perpendicular to the face of the board, the medullary rays often produce beautiful "figure" such as silver grain, medullary spots, pith flecks, etc.

The function of medullary rays is to carry chemicals which fight invasion by insects and fungi, and block any damaged areas. The cells deposit tannins and resins which block up the damaged area. This process is called "tylosis".

Cytokine storm

A cytokine storm is an overreaction of the body's immune system. It can be deadly. It consists of a positive feedback loop between cytokines and immune cells.

It is believed that cytokine storms were responsible for many of the deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed a disproportionate number of young adults. In this case, a healthy immune system may have been a liability rather than an asset. Preliminary research results from Hong Kong also suggest this as the probable reason for many deaths during the SARS epidemic in 2003. Human deaths from the bird flu H5N1 usually involve cytokine storms as well.

Black Hole of Calcutta

Black Hole of Calcutta was a dungeon in old Fort William, Calcutta, India. It was 18 feet (5.5 metres) long and 14 feet (4 metres) wide, and had two small windows. 

The fort was built by the British to defend their trading interests in Calcutta. During hostilities in 1756, the fort was captured by the army of the Nawab of Bengal on 20 June. John Zephaniah Holwell, a British eyewitness, reported that those taken in the capture of the fort, numbering 146, were confined to the dungeon, and that only 23 survived. The story was told by John Zephaniah Holwell, a survivor. However, 146 people could not have fit in a room of 24 x 18 feet. Today most concede that Holwell greatly exaggerated the number of captives.

The British captured and killed the Nawab. An obelisk was later raised in memory of those who died in the Black Hole. Holwell's account of the incident has been challenged by modern historians and scholars.


Vellum

Vellum is a high-quality form of parchment. Originally, it meant calf skin, but in English the term is used more widely.

Like parchment, the skin is prepared to take writing in ink. It was one of the standard writing surfaces used in Europe before paper became available. It continued to be used for high-status documents. The vellum was used for single pages, scrolls, codices or books.

To manufacture vellum, the skin is cleaned, then bleached, stretched on a frame called a "herse", and scraped with a knife. When vellum is scraped, it is by turns wet and dry to create tension. A final finish is got by rubbing the surface with pumice, and treating it with lime or chalk. Then it is ready to accept ink.

Modern "paper vellum" (sometimes called vegetable vellum) is made out of synthetic material instead of mammal skin, but is used for the same purpose as normal vellum.

In ancient Europe, vellum meant good quality prepared animal skin. Calves, sheep, goat and even camel are known to have been used to make vellum. The very best vellum was made from unborn animals. It can be hard to identify the animal used to make old vellum without using a science lab.

French sources defined velum (or velin in French) as made from calves only. This has remained true in modern times.

Most of the best sort of medieval manuscripts were written on vellum. Some Buddhist texts were written on vellum, and all Sifrei Torah texts are written on vellum or something similar.

A quarter of the 180 copy edition of Johannes Gutenberg's first Bible printed in 1455 was also printed on vellum, presumably because his costumers expected this for a high-quality book. Paper was used for most book-printing at the time.

In art, vellum was used for paintings, especially if they needed to be sent long distances, before canvas became widely used in about 1500, and continued to be used for drawings, and watercolours. Old master prints were sometimes printed on vellum, especially for presentation copies, until at least the seventeenth century.

Limp vellum or limp-parchment bindings was used frequently in the 16th and 17th centuries, and were sometimes gilt. In later centuries vellum has been more commonly used like leather. Vellum can be stained virtually any color but mainly it is not, as many people like its faint grain and hair markings.

Many documents that needed to last long were written in vellum as it was able to last longer than paper. Some vellum-written documents are more than a thousand years old.

British Acts of Parliament are still printed on vellum for archival purposes, as are those of the Republic of Ireland. It is still used for Jewish scrolls, for luxury book covers, memorial books, and for various documents in calligraphy.

Today, because of low demand and complicated manufacturing process, animal vellum is expensive and hard to find. Only one UK company still supplies them. A modern vellum-like alternative is made out of cotton. Known as paper vellum, this material is cheaper than animal vellum and can be found in most art and crafting supply stores. Some brands of writing paper and other sorts of paper use the term "vellum" to suggest quality.

In the artistic crafts of writing, illuminating, lettering, and bookbinding, "vellum" is normally reserved for calfskin, while any other skin is called "parchment".

Paper vellum is made from cotton. Usually translucent, paper vellum in various sizes is often used in applications where tracing is required, such as architectural plans. Like natural vellum, the paper vellum is more stable than paper, which is frequently critical in the development of large drawings and plans such as blueprints.

Vellum is typically stored in a stable environment with a stable temperature. If vellum is stored in an environment with less than 11% relative humidity, it becomes fragile, brittle, and susceptible to mechanical stresses; if it is stored in an environment with greater than 40% relative humidity, it becomes vulnerable to mold or fungus growth. The best temperature for the preservation of vellum is 20 ± 1.5 °C (68 ± 3 °F)

Mary in Islam

Mary (; ), the mother of Isa (;) is venerated in Islam. Her parents are mentioned as Imran (عمران) and Hannah (حنا). She is one of the most important and righteous women in Islam. She is mentioned in the Quran more than in the New Testament (Bible). She is the only woman mentioned by name in the Quran. Many Muslim women look up to her as an example. According to the Quran, Allah (God) chose Mary above all women of all nations. The Quran states: 
Behold! the angels said: "O Mary! Allah hath chosen thee and purified thee- chosen thee above the women of all nations.
Mary is mentioned in the Quran frequently. Her life narrative occurs in the earliest chapters. The nineteenth chapter is named after her. The chapter is called "Maryam".

In the Quran, Mary is believed to be a daughter of (Imran) Amram and (Hanna) Anne. While some confuse the parents of Moses. Aaron and their Sister Miriam to be the same of the Virgin Mary, this is not correct. While Moses and Harun did have a sister named Miriam (Mary,) and while their father was also named Amram (Imran), this does not mean that the parents of both Prophet Moses and The Virgin Mary were the same. However, the outcome of this result is still unknown for certain.

the Hebrew name "Merriam" The original name for Mary. In the Qur’an, Mary is called the daughter of Imran, and sister of Aaron. This made some Jews and Christians claim that the Qur’an didn't make a difference between the time of Moses and Jesus but there is a hadith. To clarify this issue Al-Mughira reported:

"When I came to Najran, they (the Christians of Najran) asked me: You read " O sister of Aaron " in the Qur'an, whereas Moses was born much before Jesus. When I came back to the prophet I asked him about that, he said: The (people of the old age) used to give names (to their children) after the names of Apostles and pious persons who had gone before them" Meaning that Aaron here was not Moses' brother but another one. Al-Baghawi also cites a narration from Al-Kalbi that Aaron referred to here was a brother of Maryam through her father, and he was the most righteous man amongst children of Israel in that time.

The Quran states Jesus came after the Jewish prophets of Israel. So, according to the Quran, there is a long distance between Moses and Jesus. "Then in the footsteps of the prophets, We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah revealed before him." Surah Al-Ma'idah.

The birth of Mary is mentioned in the Quran in various chapters. Her father Imran () is also mentioned in the Quran. The Quran says that Hannah and Imran were old and had no children for years. One day Anne saw a bird feeding her young. Seeing this made Anne want a child for herself. She prayed to Allah for a child. She promised that if her prayers were answered, her child's life would be dedicated to the service of Allah. Anne also prayed for her child to be protected from the "touch" of Satan (; ).

The Quran says that Mary grew up in the temple of prayer and had a special place of her own in the temple. The Quran states that there was a cast of the dice to decide who would become the guardian of Mary. The person chosen through this process was the Prophet Zechariah. Often, when Zechariah would visit the chamber of Mary, he would find her with quantities of food. He always asked her where she had obtained the food, and Mary would always answer: "Allah provides to whom he will." As a prophet, Zechariah would not have questioned this response because he would have known that Allah is the provider of all things in life and, indeed, of life itself.

The birth of Isa and the Annunciation of Mary are very important to Islam. They are considered to be some of the most important miracles of Allah. The first mention of the Annunciation following the Birth of Isa is in sura 19 (Maryam) ayah 20. The Quran tells us that the Angel Gabriel (, al-Ruḥ al-Quds, Jibra'il) came to the Virgin Mary and told her that she would soon be pregnant with a holy child. The Virgin Mary asked how it would be possible for her to become pregnant when no man had touched her. The Angel Gabriel replied that nothing is impossible for Allah, and that the Birth of Jesus would be a sign for all mankind. The birth is mentioned later at sura 66 (At-Tahrim) ayah 12, where the Quran says that the Virgin Mary remained pure while Allah created Isa inside her womb.

The Quran speaks of the virgin birth of Isa many times. The Quran also states that Jesus was created when Allah breathed on Mary while her body was chaste.

The Quran's narrative of the birth of Isa is different from that of Jesus as found in the New Testament. The Quran says that Mary was suffering childbirth pains, when she saw a nearby palm tree and held on to it. While she was holding on to the tree, she heard a voice that seemed to come from the earth beneath the tree. The voice said, "Grieve not! Thy Lord hath provided a rivulet beneath thy feet. Shake the trunk of the palm-tree towards thyself and It will drop its fresh ripe dates upon thee." Mary then promised not to speak with any man that day. 

Later, after Isa's birth, Mary brought him to the temple. All of the men in the temple mocked her, except Zechariah, who believed in the virgin birth. The Israelites demanded to know how she could possibly have had a baby without a man, whereupon the Virgin Mary responded by pointing to Jesus who then spoke his first prophecy.


"O Mary! Worship your Lord devoutly: prostrate yourself".


"O Mary! Bow down in prayer with those men, who bow down." This is believed to be the command to Mary by the Angels.


"O Mary! God has chosen you and purified you and again he has chosen you above all women of all nations of the worlds"


Mary is believed to have been buried in a tomb at the foot of the Mount of Olives in the Kidron Valley. This tomb is known today as the Tomb of the Virgin Mary.

Knockout

Knockout, also known as the knockout game and knockout king, is a violent activity played by teenagers. The object of the game is to render unconscious (knockout) an innocent pedestrian with one punch. The game can result in serious injuries or death for its victims. Players face criminal charges.

In 1992, a teen stabbed an MIT student through the heart, killing him. In another case, a St. Louis, Missouri teenager allegedly attacked a pedestrian who hit his head on the ground and died in hospital. In May 2013, a 51 year-old man died from his injuries after he was attacked in Syracuse, New York, by two teenagers.

Carmine Crocco

Carmine Crocco (June 5, 1830 – June 18, 1905) was an Italian outlaw. He is also known as Donatello and for his brilliant battle skills was nicknamed “Napoleon of the brigands”.

Born in Rionero in Vulture, a town in the Basilicata region, He began the criminal activity after killing a comrade in a brawl during the military service and joined the Garibaldi's expedition of the thousand in 1860 hoping for a pardon. However, his offence wasn't cleared and Crocco was arrested. He escaped from prison with the help of the Fortunato, a bourgeois family linked to the Bourbon dynasty and became the leader of the peasants rebellion in Basilicata, who didn't get any benefit with the political change.

He fought in the service of king Francis II, heading an army of almost 2.000 men and conquering various centers of Basilicata and Campania. In every conquered territory he overthrew the Savoy government and appointed a representative of the Bourbon crown, ordering the badges and ornaments of the fallen king to be once again displayed. 

A skillful guerrilla man, was able to harass the national guards and the Piedmontese soldiers for almost four years but he lose the conflict after being betrayed by his lieutenant Giuseppe Caruso, who revealed his plans and hideouts to the Italian authorities. Thus he fled to the Papal States hoping for help from Pius IX but was arrested by his soldiers. Later was handed over to the Italian government and condemned to death but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. 

Crocco died in prison at Portoferraio, Tuscany.

A disputable personality, he is considered by some authors a fierce thief and murderer but many people of southern Italy regard him as a folk hero who represented the suffering of the lower class before and soon after the Italian unification.


Nightstand

A nightstand, (could also be called a night table or bedside table) is a small type of table. It is usually placed next to a bed or somewhere else in a bedroom. It is a coffee table which is used next to a person's bed at night time.

Before flushing toilets became common, nightstands usually had a chamber pot in them. Nightstands which were made a long time ago sometimes had a drawer, and they usually had a small cupboard at the bottom. 

Nightstands used today usually also have a drawer. Things like lamps, alarm clocks, mobile phones, water or medication, which could be useful during the night, are often put either on top of or inside nightstands.

French, Italian and Spanish antique nightstands usually have a drawer and a small cupboard with only one door. They can also have special finishes, like bronze.

It is thought that the word "nightstand" was first used in 1892. 

Rob Bourdon

Robert Gregory Bourdon (born January 20, 1979) is the drummer and youngest member of the rock band Linkin Park. Bourdon was born in Calabasas, California and now lives in Los Angeles. He grew up in the same town as the members of Incubus and Hoobastank. Bourdon started to play drums after watching an Aerosmith concert. His mother, Patty, is friends with Joey Kramer, Aerosmith's drummer. They also dated when the were much younger. This friendship meant they were able to go backstage and see the entire production. Kramer also gave Bourdon a kick pedal.

In his early teen years, Bourdon played in a few bands with his friends. It was around that time that he met his current Linkin Park bandmate, Brad Delson. They played together for about a year in a band called Relative Degree. Their goal was to play at the Roxy Theatre. After achieving their goal with a sell-out show, Relative Degree eventually broke up.

Bourdon once dated actress Shiri Appleby. He dated actress Vanessa Lee Evigan, starting in 2001 but has been single since at least early 2008. His birthday was featured on an episode of iTunes' LPTV. On January 20, 2004, Linkin Park played a show in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the band can be seen joking around backstage and saying that it is Bourdon's twentieth. Bourdon's favorite songs to play are "In the End", "Tinfoil" and "The Little Things Give You Away". His hobbies include playing the piano (although he has never done so for a Linkin Park recording) and surfing.

Bourdon wears racing shoes to get a better feel for the drum pedals; he says it gives him better control of the pedals. He also said that the song "Easier to Run" was the most difficult to play because he had to approach the drums very differently in which he was able to record the song in a few takes.

Jayne Mansfield

Jayne Mansfield (born Vera Jayne Palmer; April 19, 1933 – June 29, 1967) was an American movie, stage, and television actress. She was also a nightclub entertainer, a singer, and one of the early "Playboy" Playmates. Mansfield became a major Broadway star in 1955, a major movie star in 1956, and a major celebrity in 1957.

Mansfield was the only child of Herbert William Palmer (1904–1936) and Vera Jeffrey Palmer (1903–2000). She was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Her father was of German descent and her mother was of English descent.

After her father's death in 1936, Jayne, her mother, and stepfather Harry Lawrence Peers moved to Dallas, Texas. After high school graduation, she studied acting at Southern Methodist University and the University of Texas at Austin.

Edward Doty

Edward Doty (c. 1599 – August 23, 1655 in Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay Colony).

Edward Doty was a passenger on the historic 1620 voyage of the "Mayflower". He was a servant to Stephen Hopkins. Hopkins was making his second journey to the New World having travelled for ten years under Capt. John Smith at Jamestown in Virginia Colony.

Doty was born in England. It is thought he was from East Halton in Lincolnshire. According to author Charles Banks, Doty lived in London at some point and traveled with another Londoner, Stephen Hopkins, as his servant.

Edward Doty left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" spotted land. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land 21 November at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.

Doty was one of two indentured servants of Stephen Hopkins. The other servant was Edward Leister. They travelled with Hopkins and his family.

When they landed the men went to find a place where they could live and grow crops. One of the first exploration missions included William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish , Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edward Doty. According to William Bradford, they left in a small board in below freezing weather. Many of the men were already ill. Bradford wrote that when they set sail the salt spray froze on their coats, as if they had been glazed. Of this group Hopkins was the most experienced, having seen Native Americans during his time at Jamestown. During this trip the "Mayflower" men came upon some Native Americans who appeared to be cutting up a large whale. The Natives ran when they saw the men. The men camped while trying to protect themselves and stay warm. 

In late 1620, Doty went with Stephen Hopkins and others on other explorations of the Cape Cod area.

Doty was one of the "Mayflower" passengers that has left a record of his personality. He had a quick temper that sometimes caused him trouble. Some said he was an unfair businessman. People who made trouble were often banished from Plymouth. Isaac Allerton was forced out. Doty must have changed for the better because he lived in Plymouth his whole life.

Edward Doty became a rich land owner with servants himself. At times, he could be disagreeable with others. This caused him to be in the Plymouth court many times.

Doty’s first problem with the law came after the Pilgrims had begun building their settlement. In June of 1621 Doty fought a duel (with a sword and dagger) with Edward Leister. Edward Leister was the other servant of Stephen Hopkins. The result was that one man was wounded in the hand and one in the thigh. Their punishment was to be tied head and feet together for one day without food or drink. But soon their master Stephen Hopkins felt sorry for them and asked to end their punishment. He promised they would change their behavior. The Governor let them free.

In the 1623 Division of Land, Doty received 1 acre of land. After that he received 20 acres more. He also purchased much land and became quite wealthy. Some of his land in Plymouth is where the Mayflower Society House now stands.

Doty received some cattle in the 1627 Division of the Cattle. At that time he had finished his term of service to Stephen Hopkins. His name as “Edward Dolton”, is listed with the family of John Howland and wife Elizabeth. In Plymouth Colony records, Doty’s name was also spelled variously as Doten (Mayflower Compact), Dotey (1626 Purchasers and 1643 bear arms lists), Dolton (1627 Division of the Cattle), and Dowty (1633/34 tax lists). 

The 1632 records of the Plymouth Court has twenty-three cases that mentions Edward Doty. There were complaints that he cheated people, said bad things about people which were not true, fought with people, and stole. Doty was never punished except for paying small fines. This means that most of the cases were found to be untrue or very minor cases. Except for the duel in 1621, he never had any physical punishment. Physical punishment could have been whipping, branding, banishment, prison and public punishment.

Except for his occasional court cases, Doty lived a normal life as a freeman, paying his taxes and all his debts. He received some special property rights and benefits from being classed as a “first comer” or "Mayflower" passenger.

The joined with other members of the community in a town meeting of February 10, 1643. He was assigned with George Clark, John Shaw, Francis Billington and others to build a wolf trap in the town of Plain Dealing.”

Doty's name appears on the August 1643 Able to Bear Arms (ATBA) List. It is spelled “Edward Dotey”. This was for the protection of the colony against unfriendly Indians or other enemies.

Edward Doty married Faith Clarke. They had nine children.

The parents of Faith Clarke on January 9, 1635 were Thurston (Tristram) and Faith Clarke. They arrived in Plymouth Colony on the ship “Francis” in 1634. Many of Doty’s court cases involved Thurston and George Clarke. He had many disagreements, including fights with the family of his wife. Bradford wrote that Doty by a second wife has seven children, and all are living. They had two more children after he wrote that.

The children were named Edward, Thomas, John, Samuel, Desire, Isaac, Elizabeth, Joseph, Mary.

Edward Doty made out his will on May 20, 1655. Doty said that he was sick but still had a good memory. His will was witnessed by John Howland, John Cooke, James Hurst, and William Hoskins. Doty signed his will with a mark because he never learned to write.

Edward Doty died on August 23, 1655 in Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay Colony and was buried at Burial Hill Cemetery where there is a memorial stone for him.

Cinquecento

Cinquecento (in English: Five hundred) is an Italian term used to describe the Italian Renaissance of the 16th century, including the related styles of art, music, literature, and architecture. It is considered the century when Italy was the leader in the European civilization 

In the Cinquecento the most important center of culture in Italy was Rome, while Florence suffered from the Girolamo Savonarola rebellion and the end of the Medici power in the city.

Indeed, in Rome the Pope promoted a huge art program (like the construction of St. Peter Cathedral and the Sistine Chapel) that brought to the eternal city artists of the level of Michelangelo, Raphael, Cellini, and Bramante.
Michelangelo Buonarroti was one the most famous artists in the Cinquecento Italy: he was a painter, sculptor, architect, poet, and engineer. Along with Leonardo da Vinci, he was often called a "Renaissance man" which means that he had great talent in many areas. Michelangelo lived an extremely busy life, creating a great number of artworks. Some of Michelangelo's works are among the most famous that have ever been made. They include two very famous marble statues, "the Pieta" in Saint Peter's Basilica and "David" which once stood in a piazza in Florence but is now in the Accademia Gallery. His most famous paintings were huge frescos, the Sistine Chapel Ceiling and the "Last Judgement". His most famous work of architecture was the east end and dome of Saint Peter's Basilica.

Only Venice in Italy was able to reach a similar level to the one of Rome, mainly in paintings: Bellini, Giorgione and Tiziano created their masterpieces in this century.

The tuscan Leonardo da Vinci lived the last years of his life in the Cinquecento. He created in this century two of his pictures that are among the best-known paintings in the world: the "Mona Lisa" and the "Last Supper".

In 1532 The Prince -a masterpiece of Italian literature- was published: it was a political treatise by the Italian diplomat, historian and political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli.

In architecture the Cinquecento is famous because of Andrea Palladio (1508–80), "the most influential architect of the whole Renaissance". Palladio was to transform the architectural style of both palaces and churches by taking a different perspective on the notion of Classicism. While the architects of Florence and Rome looked to structures like the Colosseum and the Arch of Constantine to provide formulae, Palladio looked to classical temples with their simple peristyle form.

When he used the “triumphal arch” motif of a large arched opening with lower square-topped opening on either side, he invariably applied it on a small scale, such as windows, rather than on a large scale as Alberti used it at Sant’Andrea’s. This Ancient Roman motif is often referred to as the "Palladian Arch".

The second half of the Cinquecento was characterized by the development of the "Umanesimo", related even to science discoveries like the one done by Galileo Galilei in astronomy and critical thoughts like those of Giordano Bruno.

Historically the Cinquecento is characterized by the end of the process of unification of Italy, because of the French invasions and the "Sack of Rome" in 1527. Later in the century Italy was devastated by the "Italian wars" done mainly between France and the emerging Spain (a new country that enjoyed the richness and power from the discovery of America done by Cristoforo Colombo), that divided between themselves the Italian peninsula and its "Rinascimento richness".



Mickey Hargitay

Miklós "Mickey" Hargitay (January 6, 1926 – September 14, 2006) was an actor and Mr. Universe 1955. He was born in Budapest, Hungary. He was married to Jayne Mansfield.

The two fell head over heels in love. They were never seen apart. 20th Century Fox didn't want Hargitay in "Rock Hunter", because they hated Mansfield's idea of Hargitay as her "only" lover. Fox liked their sex symbols to be single. But when Jayne told the studio that she would turn the movie down, they gave in and let Hargitay appear in a bit part. 

In 1960, Jayne and Mickey would play the lead roles in "The Loves of Hercules". The movie was shot in Italy. It was never released in the United States.

Hargitay and Mansfield married on January 13, 1958. They had three children: Miklós Jeffrey Palmer Hargitay (b. December, 21 1958), Zoltán Anthony Hargitay (b. August 1, 1960), and Mariska Magdolna Hargitay (called Maria, b. January 23, 1964). 

Hargitay remodeled much of his and Mansfield's Beverly Hills mansion, "The Pink Palace". He built its famous heart-shaped swimming pool. In November 2002, the house was razed by developers. 

In May 1963, Mickey and Jayne divorced in Mexico. The divorce was ruled invalid. The two reconciled in October 1963.

After Mansfield's death in a car crash on June 29, 1967, Hargitay sued Jayne's estate for over $5,000 to support the children. In their divorce decree, she had agreed to pay child support and to give him approximately $70,000 in cash and property.

G0 phase

The G phase (called the G zero phase) or resting phase is a period in the cell cycle in which cells are inactive. Cells enter G phase from G and stop dividing. Some cells, such as neurons, remain in G for indefinite period. Some cells enter G phase semi-permanently, such as some cells of the liver and kidney. Many cells do not enter G and continue to divide throughout an organism's life, e.g. epithelial cells.

Bradford kept a written record of the new settlement at Plymouth. He wrote that: “Edward Fuller and his wife died soon after they came ashore. Their son Samuel is living and married, and has four children or more.” After the death of his parents, Samuel, then about age twelve, was taken into the household of his uncle, Samuel Fuller.

The date of death for Fuller and his wife are unknown. It was during the winter of 16/20 and 16/21. They were buried in the Coles Hill Burial Ground in Plymouth. They are remembered on the Memorial as “Edward Fuller and his wife.”

Edward had two sons: Matthew and Samuel. Samuel went to live with his uncle and became a doctor. Matthew came over to Plymouth Colony sometime after his parents.

75 (number)

Seventy-five is a natural number. It comes after seventy-four and before seventy-six.
25 * 3 is 75.
75 is a self number because there is no integer that adds up to its own digits adds up to 75. It is the sum of the first five pentagonal numbers, and therefore a pentagonal pyramidal number, as well as a nonagonal number. As the number 75 is a composite number, it has many factors other than one and the number itself. Thus, the factors of 75 are 1, 3, 5, 15, 25 and 75. What are the Multiples of 75? So, the first 10 multiples of 75 are: 75, 150, 225, 300, 375, 450, 525, 600, 675 and 750. 75 is a multiple of 3 
multiples of 3: 3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36,39,42,45,48,51,54,57,60,63,66,69,72,75,78,81,84,87,90,93,96,99. 
The number 75 is divisible by 1, 3, 5, 15, 25, 75.

Reginald Scot

Reginald Scot (ca. 1538-1599) was an English writer. He was born in Kent, England. He studied law, and served as a justice of the peace. His first book is "Perfect Platform of a Hop-Garden". This book is about growing hops. His second book is "The Discoverie of Witchcraft" (1584). This book takes a skeptical look at witches and witchcraft. It also exposes the tricks used by charlatans and magicians to fool people. Scot's purpose in writing the book was to prevent old, ill, and simple people from being charged with witchcraft. This book is important because it was one of the first to move away from medieval superstition in the Renaissance.

Conus

Conus is a large genus of small to large predatory sea snails, marine gastropod molluscs, with the common names of "cone snails", "cone shells" or "cones".

Shaped, as the name suggests, like a cone, many species have colorful patterning on the shell surface. "Conus" snails are mostly tropical in distribution. Geologically speaking, the genus is known from the Eocene to the present.

All "Conus" snails are venomous. They hunt and eat marine worms or molluscs. The larger ones prey on small bottom-dwelling fish. Cone snails use a hypodermic-like modified radula tooth and a venom gland to attack and paralyze their prey before eating it. The tooth is sometimes likened to a dart or a harpoon. It is barbed and can be extended some distance out from the mouth of the snail, at the end of the proboscis. They can "sting" humans, and should be handled with great care or preferably not at all.

Cone snail venoms are mainly peptides. The venoms contain many different toxins that vary in their effects; some are extremely toxic. The sting of small cones is no worse than a bee sting, but the sting of some larger species can be serious, occasionally even fatal to humans. Cone snail venom may be a source of new, medically important substances. 

Some Cone snails are no longer living, like Conus adversarius.

Inflation (cosmology)

In physical cosmology, the idea of inflation is a proposed theory that would explain many features of the present-day universe, including the existence of large-scale structures such as galaxies. The theory was proposed by Alan Guth in the 1970s. 

Based on the Standard Model of Cosmology, the universe has been and is expanding. The classical Big Bang theory assumes that the universe expanded at the same rate throughout universal history. Inflation says that the universe "has not" always expanded at the same rate, and that the universe has experienced many periods of brief but immense expansions in which the size of the universe nearly doubled. These periods, as said, were extremely short, lasting less than a second. After a single period, the expansion slowed down until the next rapid inflation came and, again, massively increased the size of the universe. 

The main problem solved by inflation is the origin of large-scale structures, such as galaxies. Inflation theory says that in a slow expansion of the universe, quantum fluctuations were only on the tiny distance scales; when the universe experienced a brief period of inflation, however, these quantum fluctuations are "stretched" much larger to cause density fluctuations. The places of higher density later caused matter to clump in those locations and form large-scale objects. 

Another problem is that of temperature uniformity in the universe: why is the temperature so evenly distributed? Inflation says that objects that were previously in close proximity to one another were separated very quickly during a period of inflation, so the temperature balance was still held. In the classical Big Bang theory this was a problem because the uniform expansion would mean that objects would have to travel many times the speed of light to maintain temperature balance. 

Another problem that inflation possibly solves is the problem of magnetic monopoles. Why do we no longer see magnetic monopoles in our universe? Inflation says that the few existing monopoles were so dispersed during periods of inflation that it is virtually impossible to find them now. 

Inflation theory uses General relativity to model the inflation mathematically. The metric of inflation theory is

formula_1

The main prediction of inflation theory is that particles called inflatons are created from a scalar field from Quantum field theory. These inflatons would drive the inflation periods of the universe, but they quickly decay so the inflation periods are not very long at all. It was initially thought that the Higgs boson was an inflaton, but that has recently been discredited. 

Inflation theory also suggests that there might be other universes. People's argument for the idea of multiverse is in a nutshell ""If inflation caused our universe, could it not also cause many other universes as well?"" . This prediction has no empirical basis, but it has been explored in modern physics.

Inger Stevens

Conidae

Conidae is a family of minute to quite large sea snails. They are marine gastropod molluscs in the superfamily Conoidea. Their beautiful shells are highly collectible.

The snails within this family are sophisticated predatory animals. The snails have eyes, and are active hunters. They immobilize prey with a modified radular tooth. The tooth delivers venom with neurotoxins; it is launched out of the snail's mouth in a harpoon-like action.

There have been many suggested changes to the classification of cone shells, and the details are still under investigation. The very large genus "Conus" has 600 species, and there are six other subfamilies.

Phoenician alphabet

The Phoenician alphabet was an alphabetic script that was used in the territories of modern-day Lebanon, Syria and Palestine from about the 12th century to the 5th century BC. It was written right to left. Only consonant sounds are written down, some versions have "helpers" for certain vowels.

It was used to write languages such as Phoenician and Aramaic. The script was developed from the earlier Proto-Sinaitic script. Later, the script developed into the Ancient Greek script. Most alphabetic scripts in use today are derived from the Phoenician alphabet.

Before using the modern Arabic numerals, the Arabic language used a system where each letter also had a numeric value; this system is known as Abjad.

Electronic waste

Electronic waste or e-waste is electronics that have been discarded. This includes any electronics e.g. computers, power tools and etc.

E-waste is a concern for every country in the 21st century. Because of Moore's law, the rule that states transistor numbers double every two years, people upgrade computers every 3 years on average. People usually throw away their old laptops, cameras, computers, cell phones and televisions. This creates a large amount of practically useless waste. Most countries have methods to combat e waste and find a use for obsolete technology. Some items are refurbished for use. 

Adding up the billions of computer users in the world, over 30 million tons of e-waste is created nearly every year, along with a few billions of tons of other waste.

Abderrahman Ait Khamouch

Abderrahman Ait Khamouch (born November 9, 1986) is a T46 Paralympic track and field athlete from Spain. He runs in 800 meter, 1,500 meter, 5,000 meter and marathon races. He was born in Morocco, and he later moved to Spain. He became a citizenship in August 2008. He ran for Spain at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Paralympics, and he finished second in the 1,500 meters and third in the in the 800 meters in 2008, and finished second in the marathon in 2012.

Ait Khamouch was born on November 9, 1986 in Morocco. He has an arm amputation. His arm was amputated after he fell when he was a child. The fall caused more medical problems. He eventually got gangrene. The doctors had to amputate his right arm at his shoulder.

When Ait Khamouch was 15 years old, he tried to enter Spain illegally three times via boats from Laayoune to the Canary Islands. During these trips, he saw people die. On try number four, he got a boat to Fuerteventura and entered Spain in 2001. Next, he traveled to Madrid and then to Barcelona with friends on the train.

When Ait Khamouch first got work in Barcelona, he worked at a parking lot. He got Spanish citizenship on August 25, 2008.

Ait Khamouch wrote an autobiography in Arabic titled "The Angel with the Crooked Wing." It was translated into Spanish. He speaks Spanish, French and Arabic.

Ait Khamouch is a Paralympic track and field athlete. He runs in 800 meter, 1,500 meter, 5,000 meter and marathon races. His first race was a race created French tourists in his hometown in Morocco. He won the race, and the prize of a small blue truck. After the race, he talked to the Morocco Paralympic Committee about competing in athletics, but Moroccans said no. After he got to Spain, he took part in a race in Barcelona organized by El Corte Inglés in 2003. He did well and people took notice. He then raced in other races in the area. The Athletics Federation of Catalonia and others helped Ait Khamouch get Spanish citizenship in time for him to represent Spain at the 2008 Summer Paralympics.

The first athletics club Ait Khamouch belonged to in Spain was the Athletic Club Nou Barris. In 2004, he competed the Spanish Paralympic national championships where he finished first in the 800 meters. In 2005, he got a scholarship from the Spanish Paralympic Committee. In 2008, he trained at the Center for High Performance San Cugat (Barcelona). He competed in the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships. He was one of thirty-two competitors from Spain at the competition. In 2012, he got a €2,500 coaching scholarship. He lost part of his Catalonian scholarship a year and a half before the London Paralympics. Ait Khamouch said the loss of the scholarship was politically motivated. In 2012, he set a world record at the Barcelona Marathon. He also set a qualifying time in the event for the London Paralympics at the Barcelona Marathon. In 2012, he competed in the Barcelona half marathon and he set a personal best time.

Ait Khamouch competed in the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, China. He finished second in the men's 1500 metres — T46 event and finished third in the men's 800 metres — T46 event. Four years later, he competed in the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, Great Britain. There he won a finished second in the men's marathon — T46 event. His top three finish at the 2008 Games was the first time, Paralympic or Olympic, that some one had finished in the top three by some one from Ait Khamouch's hometown in Morocco. His parents watched him compete on television in Morocco.

Ait Khamouch finished second at the London Paralympics in the T46 marathon event because he had a coughing fit with 400 meters left in the race. He was running with a cold.

Gorboduc

The Tragedy of Gorboduc is the earliest English tragedy in blank verse. It was written by Thomas Sackville and Thomas Norton. The writers took the story of the play from Geoffrey of Monmouth's "History of the Kings of Britain" (1138). The play premiered before Queen Elizabeth I on 18 January 1561. It was first printed in 1565. It was printed again in 1570 as "The Tragedy of Ferrex and Porrex".

The play is about a good king named Gorboduc. He gives his kingdom away during his lifetime to his sons. The sons quarrel over the throne. Porrex, the younger son, kills his brother, Ferrex. Their mother, Queen Videna, avenges the death of her older son by murdering Porrex. Gorboduc and Videna are then killed by their horrified former subjects.

Norton wrote the first three acts; Sackville wrote the last two. The playwrights took the tragedies of the Latin writer Seneca as their model, but ignored the classical unities of time and place. They used Classical elements such as the Chorus and the Messenger, but added non-Classical elements such as dumb shows (pantomimes) before each act.

Governorate of Dalmatia

The Governorship of Dalmatia (or "Governatorato di Dalmazia" in Italian) was a territory united to the Kingdom of Italy in April 1941, after the military conquest of the Jugoslavian Dalmatia by Italian general Vittorio Ambrosio during WWII. It lasted until September 1943.

The Governorship of Dalmatia was made up of parts of coastal Kingdom of Yugoslavia that were occupied and annexed by Italy from April 1941 to September 1943. Italy already had, since 1919, the Italian Province of Zara ("Provincia di Zara") on the Dalmatian coastline with Zara as capital and the island of Lagosta (actually called Lastovo) after World War I (for a total area of about 200 square kilometers).

The creation of the Governorship of Dalmatia fulfilled the requests of the Italian Irredentism, that already were expressed during the "Incidents of Spalato". But not all of Dalmatia was annexed by Italy, as the German puppet state - the Independent State of Croatia - took some sections of the Dalmatian areas, though the Italian army held control over all of Dalmatia.

The Kingdom of Italy divided the Governorship into three Italian provinces: "Zara" (Zadar), "Spalato" (Split) and "Cattaro" (Kotor), but never created officially an Italian region with the name "Dalmatia" (waiting for the future peace conference). While the Governorship was not officially a region of Italy, the northern Dalmatian islands of Krk ("Veglia") and Rab ("Arbe") were united to the Italian province of Fiume and became part of the Kingdom of Italy.

In September 1941 Benito Mussolini, ordered the military occupation of the entire Dalmatian coast and islands (like Ragusa, Lissa, and Pago) that belonged to fascist Croatia of Ante Pavelić: he tried to annex those areas to the Governorship of Dalmatia, but was temporarily stopped by the strong opposition of Pavelić, who retained nominal control of those areas.
The Governatorate of Dalmatia consisted of three provinces: Zara, Cattaro and Spalato. The administrative capital was Zara. After autumn 1941 also the Dalmatian islands of Pago and Lesina were annexed. These islands were occupied militarily by the Italian army, along with an area of fascist Croatia that was off the coast of Segna to the center of Bosnia (near Sarajevo and Banja Luka).
After the Kingdom of Italy changed sides to the Allies in 1943, German forces took over the area. This territory was not given to the fascist Italian Social Republic (which was a puppet state of Nazi Germany), but instead completely dissolved and added to the puppet Independent State of Croatia. Zara remained Italian (even under control of the German Army) until 1945. The city suffered a terrible bombing in 1944.

Are We Not Men? We Are Devo!

Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! is the first album released by the American new wave music band Devo. This album was produced by Queen guitarist Brian May, recorded mostly in London, England and released in the U.S. by Warner Bros. Records company in 1978.

The album received mixed reviews from critics when it was released. It reached number 12 on the UK album charts and number 78 on the U.S. "Billboard" charts. Recent reviews of the album have been mostly positive. This album is included on many "best of" lists from magazines such as "Rolling Stone", Pitchfork Media and "Spin".

Devo played the whole album live on stage for the first time on May 6, 2009. It was a part of the Don't Look Back (concert series)|Don't Look Back concert series. On September 16, 2009, Warner Bros. and Devo said they would re-release "Q: Are We Not Men?" and "Freedom of Choice", and that Devo would tour and perform both albums.

The first reaction by critics to "Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!" was mixed. Tom Carson, wrote in "Rolling Stone" that "There's not an ounce of feeling anywhere, and the only commitment is to the distancing aesthetic of the put-on", and opined that "Devo lacks most of May's warmth and much of Bowie's flair for mechanized melodrama. For all its idiosyncrasies, the music here is utterly impersonal." Critic Robert Christgau gave the album a positive rating of a B+, but noted, "In small doses it's as good as novelty music ever gets, and there isn't a really bad cut on this album. But it leads nowhere." It was voted one of the best albums of the year in the "Village Voice"'s Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1978. In January 1980, "Trouser Press" also named it one of the best albums of 1978.

Later reception of the album has been mostly positive. Steve Huey of the online music database Allmusic scored the album four and a half "stars" calling it "arguably Devo's strongest set of material, though several brilliant peaks can overshadow the remainder", and "a seminal touchstone in the development of American new wave."

Geosynchronous orbit

A geosynchronous orbit is an orbit at a height of above sea level on the Earth. At this height, the orbit takes 24 hours, so it is "in sync" with the land on Earth (the 'geo' part of geosynchronous). 

The geostationary orbit is the most common type of geosynchronous orbit. This is right above the equator, so the satellites in this orbit do not swing north or south, but stay perfectly still above a point on the equator. This is useful for communication satellites (including satellite TV).

Geosynchronous also includes orbits that are not above the equator, but since every orbit goes around the center of the Earth, the satellite must spend an equal amount of time north of the equator as it does south of the equator, so it appears to slide up and down when viewed from the Earth.

Localhost

Localhost means "this computer" in computer networking. On most computers codice_1 resolves to the IP address codice_2 in IPv6 and codice_3 in IPv4. The localhost is useful for programmers to test software independent of a network connection. Using the localhost bypasses the network card in a computer.

Applied science

Applied science is about using the findings of science to do something. In the natural sciences, this is done by engineering. In sciences such as psychology, this can mean using theoretical findings to improve a test method, for example.

Applied research is generally done to solve a problem. Applied chemists invented refrigerants long ago to cool things. Some refigerants escape into the atmosphere and damage the ozone layer, so chemists have developed new refrigerants in another example of applied research. This work not driven by a desire to know, but by a desire to solve a specific problem.


John Howland

John Howland (c. 1591 – February 23, 1672/3) was a passenger on the "Mayflower". He was an indentured servant to John Carver and travelled with him when they left England to settle in the New World. He signed the Mayflower Compact and helped to build Plymouth Colony.

John Howland was born in Fenstanton, Huntingdon, England around 1591 and was the son of Margaret and Henry Howland, and the brother of Henry and Arthur Howland. The brothers travelled later from England to Plymouth.
The Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. The first few days had good weather. They ran into a great storm with heavy winds and large waves. For days the ship could not use it's sails. The first mention of him was by William Bradford. During the storm Howland was walking on deck and was washed overboard by a large wave. He somehow caught a rope and was pulled to safety. In all there were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" reached land at Cape Cod hook. They landed on November 21.

They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.

When the "Mayflower" landed several men went to land to try to find a place where they could live. One of the earliest exploration missions included William Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish, Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edward Doty. Hopkins was the most experienced. He had seen Native Americans when he was at Jamestown. According to Bradford, they set off in below freezing weather, many of the men already being ill, "and when the set sail the salt spray froze on their coats, as if they had been glazed". During their trip they saw Indians who looked like they were cutting up a large whale. When the Indians saw the men they ran away. The men camped and protected themselves from the cold and the Indians.

Half of the Pilgrims died by the end of the first winter. Howland lived with the Carver family The following spring, on an very warm day in April, Governor Carver was planting corn when he came out of a cornfield feeling ill and he soon died. Carver was much loved by the passengers. He was a wealthy man who very hard worked along with all of the pilgrims. Bradford wrote Carver had worked himself to death. After Carver's death, Howland became a freeman. This meant that he could own his own land and could vote in Plymouth affairs. Howland was given an acre for each member of the Carver household including himself and Elizabeth Tilley, Desire Minter, and a boy named William Latham.

Howland was one of eight settlers who agreed to help to pay the colony's debt to the men in England who had paid for the voyage. From 1641 to 1655 Howland was voted deputy to the Massachusetts General Court. He was elected again in 1658.

Howland went with Edward Winslow to exploration of Kennebec River (in current day Maine), looking for possible fur trading sites and natural resources that the colony could use. While Howland was in charge of the colony's trading post, an sad incident happened there. William Bradford wrote was that it was "one of the saddest things that befell the Pilgrims." A group of traders from the Piscataqua River, was led by a man named John Hocking. Hocking started to trade in an area that did not belong to him. Howland warned Hocking to depart, but Hocking, took out a pistol and refused. Howland ordered his men to set the canoe adrift. The Plymouth men managed to cut one cable when Hocking put his pistol to the head of Moses Talbot, one of Howland's men, and shot and killed him. Another of the Howland group shot Hocking.

In Plymouth the Howlands lived on the north side of Leyden Street. They lived in other places such as Duxbury and Kingston where they had a farm. The farm burned down in 1675 during King Philip's War. By that time, John had died and Elizabeth moved in with her son, Jabez.

Until Bradford's "Of Plymouth Plantation" was discovered in 1856, it was presumed that John Howland's wife, formerly Elizabeth Tilley was the adopted daughter of Carver's. Actually her parents, uncle and aunt came to the New World but died of sickness during the first winter.) This mistake was even recorded on a gravestone that was erected for Howland on Burial Hill, in 1836.

They had ten children. Desire, John, Hope, Elizabeth, Lydia, Hannah, Joseph, Jabez, Ruth and Isaac.
John Howland died February 23, 1673 at the age of 80. He had outlived all other male "Mayflower" passengers except John Cooke, son of Mayflower passenger Francis Cooke. He is buried on Burial Hill in Plymouth, Massachusetts.

Million Dollar Password

Million Dollar Password is a television game show that aired on CBS. It is an updated version of the game show "Password". It aired from June 1, 2008 to June 14, 2009. It was hosted by Regis Philbin.

The game is played in two parts. The first part of the game has two contestants and two celebrities. Both contestants play 30-second rounds where they try to get five words from clues given by their celebrity partner. Clues have to be one word. The celebrity can give as many clues as they want for each word. They must wait for a response from the contestant before giving a new clue. Only one clue can be given at a time. After each contestant plays, they switch partners. The contestant who gets the most words after four rounds wins and moves on to the Million Dollar Password round. If the contestants are tied after four rounds, a tie-breaking word is given to both teams, starting with the team who won a coin toss. The contestant who gets the word wins.

This round has a six-step prize ladder with a top prize of $1,000,000. The contestant's celebrity partner is the one who they got the most words with. If they got the same amount of words with both celebrities, their partner is the one that they last played with. The contestant can give or receive the clues for this round. For each step of the ladder, the clue giver has to get their partner to say five words in 90 seconds. Up to three clues can be given for each word. The clue giver can pass on a word, but cannot come back to it.

If the clue giver is successful in getting their partner to say five words, the contestant wins the amount on the level that they are on. They can then decide if they want to take the money they have or go on to the next level. Each level has one less word than the last one. If a contestant fails on a level, the game ends. Failing on the first two levels means that the contestant leaves with nothing. Failing on the $50,000, $100,000 or $250,000 levels means that the contestant leaves with $25,000. If the contestant gets to the $250,000 level, they can play the $1,000,000 level with no risk of losing the $250,000.

If the contestant is giving the clues, starting at the $250,000 level, they are shown the words for that level before they decide if they want to take the money they have or go on to the next level.

Geoffrey of Monmouth

Geoffrey of Monmouth (c. 1095 – c. 1155) was a clergyman and writer. He was probably born in Wales. He was made the bishop of St Asaph on 21 February 1152.

Stories about in Geoffrey's book helped to make Arthur a popular character. Shakespeare consulted Geoffrey's book when he wrote "King Lear" and "Cymbeline".

As early as 1190, William of Newburgh wrote "it is quite clear that everything this man wrote about Arthur and his successors, or indeed about his predecessors from Vortigern onwards, was made up, partly by himself and partly by others".

It is the third largest party in the United States in terms of the popular vote in the country's elections and number of candidates run per election, and it is also identified by many as the fastest growing political party in the United States.

The political ideas of the Libertarian Party reflect the ideas of libertarianism: supporting less regulated markets, a less powerful state, strong civil liberties (favoring same-sex marriage and other LGBT rights), the legalization of cannabis, separation of church and state, open immigration, neutrality in diplomatic issues, staying out of other countries' wars, freedom of trade and travel to all foreign countries, and a better democracy. They also support more lenient gun laws.

As of February 2024, there are over 650,000 voters registered as Libertarians. Hundreds of Libertarian candidates have been elected or appointed to public office, and thousands have run for office under the Libertarian banner.

The Libertarian Party has had a number of records, such as being the first party to get an electoral vote for a woman in a United States presidential election. On May 5, 2012, Gary Johnson received the Libertarian Party's official nomination for President of the United States in the 2012 election. In 2016, Johnson once again became the party's nominee with running mate William Weld. In the United States presidential election, 2016 they won more popular votes than ever before. In 2020, Jo Jorgensen became the Presidential nominee with the running mate Spike Cohen.
Given the diverse nature of libertarianism, there are several political factions within the Libertarian Party that have formed caucuses. Currently, the Mises Caucus runs the party.

Begoniaceae

The Begoniaceae are a family of flowering plants with about 1400-1500 species occurring in the subtropics and tropics of both the New World and Old World. All but one of the species are in the genus "Begonia". The only other genus in the family, "Hillebrandia", is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands and has only one species.

Many varieties (or cultivars) of some species and hybrids of the genus "Begonia" are used as ornamental plants.

Most of the plants in this family are perennial herbaceous plants and very few are shrubs o subshrubs; they are from only a few centimetres to 3 metres tall. Their leaves and stems are succulents, that is, leaves and stems are juicy and store water.

Stems are upright (vertical) and many species form rhizomes or tubers (fleshy, thickened underground stems). In some cases, the stems are very short and the leaves are in a group close to the soil.

The leaves of most species are simple, undivided and with sides more or less unequal; in very few cases they are compound (divided). They are alternate or, when the stem is very short, they are all in a group.

Begoniaceae plants are mostly monoecious, so there are male and female flowers on the same plant; very few are dioecious, with only one kind of flower so the plants are either male or female. Flowers are grouped in inflorescences.

The fruits are capsules (simple, dry fruits) and sometimes berries; they have many very small seeds.

The chromosome number is variable, n=10-21 or more.
The family Begoniaceae was named in 1820 as Begoniae by the Bohemian scientists Friedrich Graf von Berchtold and Jan Svatopluk Presl in "Prirozenosti Rostlin", 1:270, and then in 1824 as Begoniaceae by the Swedish botanist Carl Adolph Agardh, published in "Aphorismi Botanici".

There are two genera in this family:

The New Guinean genus "Symbegonia" Warb. has recently been reduced to a section of "Begonia".

The species of this family are found abundantly in all moist tropical countries, absent only from the Australian tropical forests.

One species, "B. grandis" grows in the temperate zone, growing as far north as near Beijing (China).

Some species, hybrids and cultivars of the genus "Begonia" are used worldwide as ornamental plants in parks, gardens, balconies and as houseplants because they have beautiful leaves and flowers.

Vegetative reproduction

Vegetative reproduction is a kind of asexual reproduction. Many plants do it. By vegetative reproduction plants can cover the ground quickly: ground taken by one plant is difficult for other plants to take. This occurs naturally, and can also be done on purpose by horticulturists. 

Vegetative reproduction uses mitosis. This means that the newly created cell is a clone, and identical to the parent cell. Some plants put out new roots underground, have bulbs, or grow new vines and shoots above ground.

By this process, new plants can be grown naturally without any seeds or spores. Therefore, it is widely used especially in agriculture to spread the trees that are of great value to the economy. 

In gardening and farming, vegetative reproduction means cutting a tree branch below its center joint, planting it in some other earth, and letting it form new roots. In this way, many kinds of useful plants can be easily reproduced without any seeds, for example: apple, avocado, banana, cacao, hemp, orange/lemon, date, fig, grape, almond, pineapple, potato, strawberry, sugar cane and tea.

Xi Jinping

Xi Jinping (; born 15 June 1953) is a Chinese politician who is currently the leader of the People's Republic of China. As paramount leader, he holds the offices of General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the President of the People's Republic of China, and the Chairman of the Central Military Commission. As General Secretary, he is also a member of the CPC Politburo Standing Committee, China's top decision-making body.

Xi Jinping is the son of former Chinese Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun and Qi Xin. He rose politically in China's coastal provinces. He was the Governor of Fujian between 1999 and 2002. Between 2002 and 2007, he was Governor and CPC party chief of Zhejiang. After the dismissal of Chen Liangyu, Xi was transferred to Shanghai as the party secretary for a short time in 2007. Xi was promoted to the central leadership in October 2007 and trained to become Hu Jintao's successor.

In November 2012, he was elected as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and the Chairman of the Central Military Commission in the CPC convention. In March 2013, he was elected as the President of the People's Republic of China by the Chinese Congress. This started his first term as China's leader.

Chinese leadership changes every 5 years, and it happens roughly in October/November (for CPC and military) and March next year (for government). In October 2017 and March 2018, Xi was re-elected as party, military and government leader. This started his second term.

By tradition in recent decades, the Chinese leader leads two terms (10 years in total). The second term identifies his successor and prepares for the power transfer. However, Xi stopped this tradition and abandoned his potential successors Hu Chunhua and Sun Zhengcai.

On 11 March 2018, the National People's Congress approved an amendment to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, so that Xi and the future presidents could be reelected for president without term limits.

In July 2018, a trade war started between the US and China. At the early stage Xi showed China's muscle by declaring to fight "a tooth for a tooth". As the conflicts continues to worsen, China softened its stance. There were reports that Xi's authority got damaged by his handling of the trade dispute with US.

Xi was born on 15 June 1953 in Beijing, China. His father held lots of posts, including party propaganda chief and vice premier. He has been married to Peng Liyuan since 1987. They have one daughter, Xi Mingze, who graduated from Harvard University in 2015. Xi lives in Zhongnanhai, China.

Maya Angelou

Maya Angelou (; born Marguerite Annie Johnson; April 4, 1928 – May 28, 2014) was an American poet, author, writer, memoirist, and civil rights activist. She published seven autobiographies, three books of essays, several books of poetry, and was credited with a list of plays, films, and television shows spanning over 50 years. She received dozens of awards and more than 50 honorary degrees. Angelou was best known for her series of seven autobiographies, which focus on her childhood and early adult experiences. The first, "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" (1969), tells of her life up to the age of 17 and brought her international recognition and acclaim.

Angelou was born Marguerite Annie Johnson in St. Louis, Missouri on April 4, 1928, the second child of Bailey Johnson, a doorman and navy dietitian, and Vivian (Baxter) Johnson, a nurse and card dealer. Angelou's older brother Bailey, Jr., nicknamed Marguerite "Maya," derived from "My" or "Mya Sister." When Angelou was three and her brother four, their parents' "calamitous marriage" ended, and their father sent them to Stamps, Arkansas, alone by train, to live with their paternal grandmother Annie Henderson. In "an astonishing exception" to the harsh economics of African Americans of the time, Angelou's grandmother prospered financially during the Great Depression and World War II because the general store she owned sold needed basic commodities and because she "made wise and honest investments".

Four years later, the children's father "came to Stamps without warning" and returned them to their mother's care in St. Louis. At the age of eight, while living with her mother, Angelou was sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, a man named Freeman. She told her brother, who told the rest of their family. Freeman was found guilty but was jailed for only one day. Four days after his release, he was murdered, probably by Angelou's uncles. Angelou became mute for almost five years, believing, as she stated, "I thought, my voice killed him; I killed that man, because I told his name. And then I thought I would never speak again, because my voice would kill anyone..." According to Marcia Ann Gillespie and her colleagues, who wrote a biography about Angelou, it was during this period of silence when Angelou developed her extraordinary memory, her love for books and literature, and her ability to listen and observe the world around her.

Shortly after Freeman's murder, Angelou and her brother were sent back to their grandmother. Angelou credits a teacher and friend of her family, Mrs. Bertha Flowers, with helping her speak again. Flowers introduced her to authors such as Charles Dickens, William Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, Douglas Johnson, and James Weldon Johnson, authors who would affect her life and career, as well as black female artists like Frances Harper, Anne Spencer, and Jessie Fauset.

When Angelou was 14, she and her brother moved in with their mother once again, who had since moved to Oakland, California. During World War II, Angelou attended the California Labor School. Before graduating, she worked as the first black female streetcar conductor in San Francisco. Three weeks after completing school, at the age of 17, she gave birth to her son, Clyde (who later changed his name to Guy Johnson).

Angelou became a poet and writer after a series of jobs as a young adult, including fry cook, sex worker, nightclub dancer and performer, cast member of "Porgy and Bess", coordinator for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and journalist in Egypt and Ghana during the decolonization of Africa. She was an actress, director, producer of plays, movies, and public television programs, and writer. In 1982, she earned the first lifetime Reynolds Professorship of American Studies at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Angelou was active in the Civil Rights Movement and worked with Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X. Beginning in the 1990s, Angelou made around 80 appearances a year on the lecture circuit, something she continued into her eighties. In 1993, Angelou recited her poem "On the Pulse of Morning" (1993) at Bill Clinton's inauguration, making her the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy's inauguration in 1961.
With the publication of "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings", she publicly discussed aspects of her personal life. She was respected as a spokesperson for black people and women, and her works have been considered a defense of black culture. Her works are widely used in schools and universities worldwide though attempts have been made to ban her books from some U.S. libraries. Angelou's most celebrated works have been labeled as autobiographical fiction, but many critics consider them to be autobiographies. She made a deliberate attempt to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing and expanding the genre. Her books center on themes such as racism, identity, family and travel.

On May 28, 2014, Angelou died in her home in Winston-Salem, North Carolina of natural causes at the age of 86.

In 2021, the United States Mint announced that Angelou would be among the first women shown on the reverse of the quarter as a part of the American Women quarters series. The coins were released in January 2022. She is the first Black woman to be seen on a quarter.


Promises! Promises!

Promises! Promises! is a 1963 movie. It was the first Hollywood sound movie to feature a major star—Jayne Mansfield—in the nude. She was in three nude scenes that together lasted a bit over a minute.

"Playboy" publisher Hugh Hefner was charged with obscenity when he printed nude photos of Mansfield on the set in his magazine. The movie was banned in some American cities. It was a big box office success in cities where it was shown.

Sandy Brooks (Jayne Mansfield) wants to get pregnant. Her husband Jeff (Tommy Noonan) is too stressed out with work to make love to her. They take a cruise, and meet another couple (Marie McDonald and Mickey Hargitay).

The four get drunk. They change partners when going to their rooms. Later, both women learn they're pregnant. They wonder whether the fathers are their own or the other's husband.

"Promises! Promises!" was the first Hollywood sound movie to feature a big star in the nude. For some, the nude scenes were the movie's main attraction.

Together, these three scenes last a little bit over one minute. Mansfield was seen only topless in the movie, but the book "Hollywood Babylon" shows her on the set completely nude. Her pubic hair can be seen.

In June 1963, "Playboy" published a photo article about the movie. In the photos, Mansfield plays with one of her breasts. Publisher Hugh Hefner was arrested and charged with obscenity. He was acquitted by the jury.

"Promises! Promises!" was banned in several American cities. Both the original movie and an edited version had box office success in places where it was not banned.

Mansfield was voted one of the Top 10 Box Office Attractions by theater owners that year. Movie critic Roger Ebert wrote about Mansfield, "Finally in "Promises! Promises!" she does what no Hollywood star ever does except in desperation. She does a nudie. In 1963, that kind of box office appeal was all she had left."

Deloraine is a town on the Meander River, in the central north of Tasmania, Australia. It is 50 km west of Launceston and 52 km south of Devonport along the Bass Highway. It is part of the Meander Valley Council. There were 2,848 people living there in the .

The region was explored in 1821 by Captain Roland, who was searching for farm land. Land was granted to new settlers, and the town is now a major farming centre. There are a large number of farms of all types in the area.
Deloraine Post Office opened on 29 October 1836.

The town won the State Tidy Towns award in 1992, 1993 and 1995, and the Australian Community of the Year award in 1997.

The town is a cultural centre and is home to the largest craft fair in the Southern Hemisphere. About 40,000 people come to the annual fair which has 13 venues and over 200 stalls around the town.

The town was bypassed by the new Bass Highway in the early 1990s. However the town is still a popular resting place for travellers. It also serves as a base to explore areas such as Cradle Mountain, the Great Western Tiers, Mole Creek and the Central Highlands.

Deloraine is the educational centre for the region with both primary (Deloraine Primary School and Our Lady of Mercy Catholic School) and high schools (Deloraine High School). Students from other towns come to Deloraine's schools by bus.

Deloraine is served by ABC Television, SBS Television, Tasmanian Digital Television, Southern Cross Tasmania, WIN Television, 91.7 ABC Northern Tasmania and other ABC radio networks, commercial stations 89.3 LAFM and 90.1 Chilli FM and community station 96.9 Meander Valley FM.

Der Stürmer

Der Stürmer was a weekly newspaper published from 1923 to 1945. It contained propaganda for the policies of the Nazi Party in Germany. It was styled like a tabloid. It printed obscene antisemitic material with the intent to make people hate Jews. This included racist caricatures, accusations of blood libel and sex crimes, and articles about why Jews are a problem.

The paper was published by Julius Streicher. It was first printed in Nuremberg on 20 April 1923. This was at a time when Adolf Hitler was trying to seize power and control over the government. "Der Stürmer" continued to be published until the end of World War II. After the war, Streicher was executed for authorising the publication of articles that demanded the extermination of the Jewish race.

Richard Barthelmess

Richard Semler "Dick" Barthelmess (May 9, 1895 – August 17, 1963) was an Oscar-nominated American movie actor. He was nominated for the first Academy Award in the Best Actor category in 1928.

Barthelmess was born in New York City. He went to Hudson River Military Academy and Trinity College at Hartford, Connecticut. He worked in theaters during his school days doing "walk-ons". In college, he played in amateur productions. 

He made his first movie appearance in 1916 in a movie serial as an extra. At this time, he also appeared as a supporting player in several movies. Director D. W. Griffith saw him. He cast Barthelmess opposite Lillian Gish in "Broken Blossoms" (1919) and "Way Down East" (1920). 

He soon became one of Hollywood's highest paid actors. He was nominated for Best Actor at the first Academy Awards in 1928. He founded a production company, Inspiration Film Company. He starred in the company's "Tol'able David" (1921). This movie was a great success.

Barthelmess made several "talkies". He failed to hold on to the star status of his silent movie days. He joined the United States Navy Reserve during World War II. He was a lieutenant commander. He never went back to movies. He died of cancer in 1963. He was 68. He was buried at Ferncliff Cemetery and Mausoleum in Hartsdale, New York.

Barthelmess married Mary Hay, a stage and movie star. They had one daughter Mary Barthelmess. In 1927, Barthelmess became engaged to Katherine Young Wilson, a Broadway actress. The engagement was called off, possibly due to his affair around this time with the journalist Adela Rogers St. Johns. In 1928, Barthelmess married Jessica Stewart Sargent.

Barthelmess was one of the founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Barthelmess received the George Eastman Award for distinguished contribution to movies.

Composer Katherine Allan Lively dedicated her piano piece, "Within the Walls of China: A Chinese Episode", to Barthelmess. It was published in 1923 by G. Schirmer, Inc. An article in "The Music Trades" reported that Mrs. Lively was inspired by a seeing "Broken Blossoms". She played the piece for Barthelmess and his friends in New York in the summer of 1922.



Tol'able David

Tol'able David (1921) is a silent movie starring Richard Barthelmess. It is based on a story by Joseph Hergesheimer. The movie was produced and directed by Henry King for Inspiration Pictures. 

The movie was voted a Photoplay Magazine 1921 "medal of honor". In 2007, "Tol'able David" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". 

Young David Kinemon, son of West Virginia tenant farmers, wants to be treated like a man by his family and neighbors. He is constantly reminded that he is still a boy and he is only "tol'able" but not a man. He proves himself a man when outlaws move onto a nearby farm.


Attack aircraft

Attack aircraft are military aircraft. They are designed for attacking enemy ground or naval forces, especially moving ground or naval forces, like tanks, soldiers, and warships.

Vashi Bridge

The Vashi Bridge, also called Thane Creek Bridge, is a bridge that connects the city of Mumbai to the mainland of India at New Delhi. It is built across the Thane Creek. The bridge links Mankhurd in Mumbai with Vashi in Navi Mumbai, the satellite city of Mumbai. It is one of four entry points into Mumbai, and handles traffic in the region to the west and north of Mumbai.

The first bridge to connect Mumbai to Navi Mumbai was made in 1973. The bridge is 1837 metres in length and has a below-requirement 3 lane carriageway. Within two years of its opening to traffic, corrosion cracks were noticed on some parts of the bridge. This led to a series of extensive repairs. It was then decided to construct a new bridge to replace the faulty one. 

Construction on a new bridge began in 1987 and opened in 1997. The original Vashi Bridge or the 1st Thane Creek Bridge remains closed to traffic.

The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has plans to add six more lanes to the Vashi Bridge at an estimated cost of 400 crore.

Stress (biology)

Stress is a word used in psychology and medicine to describe a condition which may be seen in organisms.

Stress describes a living thing's response to a threat or some adverse change in its environment. In psychology, stress is a feeling of emotional strain and pressure. Stress is a type of psychological pain. Small amounts of stress may be beneficial, but more stress can increase the risk of strokes, heart attacks, ulcers, and mental illness, such as depression

There are different types of stress. Each type has different characteristics and symptoms.


Organisms can respond to stress in different ways.


Stress may also lead to adaptations, which allow certain organisms to better deal with the stressors. Stress happens every day, and is part of every living thing's life. Too much stress is bad and can cause health problems. Stress plays a part in some physical problems, like heart disease. Stress also plays a part in many mental illnesses, like anxiety, Acute Stress Disorder, and PTSD. Acute Stress Disorder and PTSD are mental illnesses that can happen when a person experiences something that is very terrifying, like a major accident or a war. Another type of stress disorder is a "psychosomatic illness" where a person has physical symptoms that are caused by an emotional stress, not by physical harm.

There are different ways to deal with stress. One tip is to remove yourself from the stressor. For example if a school assignment is causing stress, taking a break from the assignment can be good. This break can include sleeping or engaging in hobbies. Physical activity and exercise reduce stress. Social support from friends and family can be helpful. Health care professionals can help when stress is bad and affects physical or mental health. Relaxing with meditation and deep breathing can also manage stress. 

Hawking radiation

Hawking radiation is black body radiation which is emitted by black holes, due to quantum effects near the event horizon. It is named after the physicist Stephen Hawking, who provided a theoretical argument for its existence in 1974.

As a result of quantum fluctuations, particle-antiparticle pairs can appear from the vacuum of space near the event horizon of a black hole in which the net energy of the particles is zero due to the matter and antimatter nature of the particles. In normal conditions, particle-antiparticle pairs that appear due to the quantum fluctuations annihilate each other. But if one member of the pair falls beyond the event horizon of the black hole, the other particle will not have a sister with which to annihilate. The member that does not fall into the black hole is then emitted from the black hole as hawking radiation. The particle that falls into the black hole effectively has negative energy, meaning that it will subtract from the overall mass-energy content of the black hole. Thus, after enough time has passed, the black hole will evaporate from these negative particles, while seeming to emit positive ones. Hawking radiation reduces the mass and the energy of the black hole and is therefore also known as black hole evaporation. Because of this, black holes that lose more mass than they gain through other means are expected to shrink and ultimately vanish.

Hawking radiation is such a small effect that it has never been measured. Micro black holes (MBHs) are predicted to be larger net emitters of radiation than larger black holes (and should thus shrink and dissipate faster), but MBHs have yet to be observed. 

High-level programming language

In computer science, a high-level programming language is a programming language that does not require knowledge of computer hardware. The advantage with high-level programming languages is that programmers only need to understand the syntax (i.e. the type of structure of the code) of the programming language and don't have to understand computer hardware to program well. Low-level programming languages require knowledge of both the syntax and the hardware they are programming for.

What determines a programming language as "high-level" depends on how much the programming language relies on hardware knowledge. Programming languages that require less knowledge about computer hardware are called "high-level" programming languages. It doesn't matter whether a programming language is considered easy to learn or not.

Rather than dealing with functions of computer hardware, high-level programming languages deal with more abstract concepts. High-level programming languages focus more on what the program will output. An interpreter is required to translate high-level programming language for low-level programming languages to tell the hardware what to do.

High-level programming languages can use variables, arrays, conditional statements, subroutines, loops, and among other functions to help produce the output. High-level programming languages are generally easier to do than low-level programming languages. The syntax used to make a program generally has clearer language than lower-level programming languages.


Low-level programming language

In computer science, a low-level programming language is a programming language that involves knowledge of both computer hardware and the coding used to make the computer hardware do actions. The advantage of low-level programming languages compared to high-level programming languages is that they can directly communicate with the computer hardware to do actions. There is less need for an interpreter to convert programming languages into code that the computer understands. Low-level programming languages require knowledge of the hardware to make the most of what the hardware can do. The term "low-level" usually refers to assembly language.

A programming language can be called "low-level" because the actions the code describes are close to the computer hardware. A "high-level" language can be seen as "far away" or "high above" the computer hardware and closer to the programmer.

What determines a programming language as "low-level" depends on how much the programming language relies on hardware knowledge. Programming languages that require more knowledge about computer hardware are called "low-level" programming languages. It doesn't matter whether a programming language is considered easy to learn or not.

Rather than focus on what the program will output regardless of computer hardware, low-level programming languages deal directly at the computer hardware. Low-level programming languages will aim at what the hardware will actually do to make the actions that have been programmed. An interpreter is required to translate high-level programming language for low-level programming languages to tell the hardware what to do.

Low-level programming languages often use more technical code that is clearer for the hardware to understand. Low-level programming languages are generally harder to do than high-level programming languages due to how technical the syntax is (i.e. the structure of the coding is difficult to understand because of how complex it is).

Low-level programming languages are often tied to a particular CPU or instruction set. For example, a program written in ARM assembly language cannot run on an x86 processor without emulation.

Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)

Sir Alexander Mackenzie (1764-1820) was a Scottish explorer who explored the area that is now the Northwest Territories. Mackenzie was born in Stornoway, on the Scottish island of Lewis with Harris in 1764. Mackenzie made his fortune as a fur trader in northwest Canada. 

In 1789, Mackenzie left Fort Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca with a small party of Canadians and native guides. He travelled north to Great Slave Lake on a boat or a canoe. Then he followed the river that now bears his name, the Mackenzie River. He was the first European to travel on the Mackenzie River. It took him to the Arctic Ocean. He had hoped the river would lead him to the Pacific Ocean.

In 1801 he wrote the book "Voyages on the River Saint Lawrence and Through the Continent of North America, To the Frozen and Pacific Oceans in the Years 1789 and 1793". This book contains information on native tribes and Canadian history of that time period.

He spent his last years in Scotland.

Jerusalem artichoke

The Jerusalem artichoke ("Helianthus tuberosus"), also called sunroot, sunchoke, earth apple or topinambour, is a species of sunflower native to eastern North America, and found from eastern Canada and Maine west to North Dakota, and south to northern Florida and Texas. It is also cultivated widely across the temperate zone for its tuber, which is used as a root vegetable.
The herbaceous plant is perennial. It can reach heights of up to . The leaves are oval, and grow to to wide, and to long. The plant has been imported to Europe, and it is seen as an invasive species - few animals eat it, and it will take away the space of other plants. This means that often, there is uncontrolled growth.

The plant has been used to make spirits and sugar. It is a food plant for animals such as horses and pigs. People who suffer from diabetes often use it: Up to sixteen percent of the plant is made of the polysaccharide inulin.

In the 1980s, the Jerusalem artichoke also gained some notoriety when its seeds were planted by midwestern US farmers at the prodding of an agricultural pyramid scheme. There was little market for the tuber in that part of the US at the time, but farmers were assured it would soon appear on the commodity market. The only profits were realized by the initial distributors and the first few levels of farmers (who sold their seeds to other levels of the pyramid). As a result, many of the farms that had planted large quantities of the crop were ruined.

Elsa Lanchester

Elsa Sullivan Lanchester (28 October 1902 – 26 December 1986) was an English actress in theatre, movies, and television.

Following Laughton's death in 1962, Lanchester resumed her career with appearances in such Disney films as "Mary Poppins" (1964), "That Darn Cat!" (1965) and "Blackbeard's Ghost" (1968). One of her last roles was in "Murder By Death" (1976). 

Moses Fletcher

Moses Fletcher (c.1564–1620/1) was a passenger on the "Mayflower" in 1620 and was one of the signers of the Mayflower Compact.

Fletcher was born in Sandwich in England. He married Mary Evans in 1589 and had 10 children. Fletcher worked as a blacksmith.

Fletcher did not want to be a member of the Church of England. He did not follow some of the Church rules and told others that he did not believe in the teachings of the Church. On June 12, 1609, Moses Fletcher, along with the wife of future "Mayflower" passenger James Chilton and several other persons were excommunicated from the church for the illegal burial of a child.

Fletcher became a Separatist. This religion was illegal in England. He and his family left England with the Chilton family and moved to Leiden in Netherlands. His wife Mary died and he married Sarah, a widow from Leiden.

Fletcher came on the Mayflower without his family.

The "Mayflower" left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, they spotted land. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was damaged and they were forced to land 21 November at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. 

Fletcher died in the winter of 1620–1621 in the general sickness.

Fletcher was buried in the Cole's Hill Burial Ground in Plymouth. His name is on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb.

The Bass Highway is a highway in Tasmania, Australia. It is a part of the National Highway, named National Highway 1. It joins the major cities across the north of the state - Burnie, Devonport and Launceston. The Bass Highway is, like Bass Strait, named for explorer George Bass.

The highway connects the following towns:

From Burnie, the Bass Highway is no longer a National Highway, and connects the following towns:


As part of the National Highway, there have been many changes to the highway. In the 1980s it was made longer to join the southern exit at Launceston which connects to the Midland Highway. Almost the entire length of the highway has been re-aligned to allow for dual carriageway, overtaking lanes, and the bypass of small towns.

Between Launceston and Deloraine, this had included Carrick and Hadspen in the 1980s and Deloraine in the early 1990s. The longest stretch of highway, the Hagley-Westbury bypass, was completed in 2001. People living in the small towns have been concerned that they no longer get passing trade. The 'old' highway, now known as the Meander Valley Highway, is promoted as a tourist route.

The highway between Latrobe and Somerset has had a similar re-alignment. This section of the highway is more of a commuter highway than a tourist highway, and as such the local economy does not rely on passing tourists.

Neonatal diabetes mellitus

Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is a type of diabetes. It happens during the first 6 months of human life. Infants with this condition do not produce enough insulin. This causes an increase of blood sugar. NDM is often mistaken for the much more common Type 1 diabetes, although type 1 often happens after the first 6 months of life. In almost 60% of those with NDM, this condition lasts their whole life.

Symptoms of NDM include thirst, frequent urination and dehydration. Most fetuses with NDM do not grow properly in the uterus. Newborns are much smaller than most other newborns. After birth, many babies do not gain enough weight or grow as rapidly as other babies.

Rosacea

Rosacea is common chronic inflammatory skin disorder that is characterized by redness, erythema, telangiectasis, papules or pustules, hyperplasia, or a combination of these manifestations. It gets worse if left untreated. There are four types of rosacea, three involving human skin and the fourth affecting eyes.
Rosacea affects approximately 5.46% prevalence in the world's adult population, especially affects mostly Caucasians (northern European descendants) and light-skinned populations. Rosacea affects both males and females. Females are three times more likely than males to get rosacea. It can happen to people of any age. 
Things that can cause rosacea are several environmental factors like exposure of the face to extreme temperature, the heat of sunlight, severe sunburn, stress, depression, anxiety, alcohol and spicy foods. Also a genetic predisposition with a neurogenic inflammation and the family inheritance are relationated with this condition. Most people with rosacea have only mild redness and are never officially diagnosed or treated.

What is the point of learning
Ur (supercontinent)

UR was a supercontinent, on the Earth, that formed 3.1 billion years ago in the early Archaean eon (during the Mesoarchaean era). It might have been the oldest continent on Earth, half a billion years older than Arctica. However, one other supercontinent, Vaalbara, may have come before Ur. Vaalbara might have formed about 3.6 billion years ago. 

Ur joined with the continents Nena and Atlantica about 1 billion years ago to form the supercontinent Rodinia. Ur had survived as a single unit, until it was separated when the supercontinent Pangaea broke apart into Laurasia and Gondwana.

Rocks that made up Ur are now parts of Africa, Australia, and India.

In the early period of Ur's existence, it was probably the only continent on Earth. Therefore, scientists call Ur a supercontinent, even though it was probably smaller than Australia is now. Today's New Zealand is similar to Ur, but rotated 90 degrees out of phase, and about too far south. 

When Ur was the only continent on Earth, all other land was in the form of small granite islands and small land-masses like Vaalbara, which were not large enough to be continents.

1931 Belize hurricane

The 1931 Belize hurricane was a severe tropical cyclone that took place in September 1931. It killed more than twenty-five hundred in Central America, including Belize (called British Honduras at that time). The hurricane struck Belize City with winds near 135 miles per hour. The storm hit on September 10, and then traveled westward over the Yucatán Peninsula of eastern Mexico. It later weakened over the Bay of Campeche, made its final landfall near the northern Mexico-south central Texas border, and then died.

Squanto

Squanto (or Tisquantum, 1580? – November 1622) was a Native American who helped the Pilgrims survive in the New World. He learned to speak English and was hired as a guide and interpreter. He taught the Pilgrims to plant corn. Squanto had much power among the Native Americans and the Pilgrims. He abused it, and barely escaped an Indian execution. He died in 1622 while making a trip around Cape Cod.

Squanto was born around 1580 in the area of present day Plymouth, Massachusetts. He was a member of the Paxutet people. Little is known about his early life. Squanto is thought to have been kidnapped as a young boy along the coast of Maine, and taken to England in 1605. He was taught English. He was hired as a guide and interpreter. He returned to his homeland with John Smith in 1614.

In 1614, Squanto and 23 other Indians were kidnapped by a lieutenant under Smith. This lieutenant sold him and the rest of the Indians as slaves in Malaga, Spain. Many historians have disputed what happened in this period of his life, as there is no written record. One theory is that once the Spanish found out these slaves were from the New World, Spanish friars rescued the remaining Indians, including Squanto, by purchasing them. They sent him on his way to England. It is not known what happened to the others. This is where he was taught English and the ways of the white man. He was employed by John Slaney of the Newfoundland Company, and was sent to Newfoundland around 1617, as an interpreter. He returned to his homeland in North America in 1619.

Upon Squanto's arrival, he discovered his people had been wiped out by disease; he was the sole survivor of the Paxutet people. The Wampanoag people adopted him, although not without hesitation. The chief, Massasoit was suspicious of Squanto due to his exposure with the white man and his new ability to speak their language. He knew Squanto's knowledge of English would help with trade, so he kept him.

In the spring of 1620, the Mayflower made landfall in Cape Cod, then mainland. They set camp on the same grounds of Squanto's people—they called this colony, Plymouth. After the harsh conditions of winter, about half of the colonists died. In the spring of 1621, an Indian who made friend with the English settlers, Samoset took Squanto to the Pilgrim settlement of Plymouth. Samoset could only speak broken English, while Squanto was seen as a master. Squanto was soon living with the people of Plymouth.

He joined them in meeting with Indian tribes. He helped to keep the peace. Tradition says he taught the Pilgrims to catch eels. William Bradford wrote that Squanto was of great help in the first year's spring planting of corn. He showed the Pilgrims both how to plant it and how to tend it. He showed them how to use fish as a fertilizer.

Over the year, Squanto's power went to his head. He told the natives that he had the power to send the white man's plague or to make them attack.This was one of many shady deals he conducted with both the Pilgrims and the natives. He was found out, and barely escaped an Indian execution.

In November 1622, Squanto fell ill with a fever while on a trip around Cape Cod with William Bradford. He may have been poisoned by the Wampanoag. He bled at the nose, and said it was a certain sign of death. He asked Bradford to pray to the Christian god so he might enter Heaven. He gave some gifts to others. He died a few days later in what is now Chatham, Massachusetts.

A Disney movie loosely based on Squanto's Life, "", was released a year before "Pocahontas".

Sacrifice

A sacrifice is giving something up. In many religions, it usually is about giving something to God or gods. Many Pagan peoples made human sacrifices and animal sacrifices. The Greek play "Iphigenia" by Euripides contains an example of this. In the Old Testament, Jewish people followed the laws about animal sacrifices in the book of Leviticus. Cows and pigeons were killed to make atonement with God. In the New Testament, Christ's death on the cross is seen as substitutionary atonement for sin.

Kaufman died on May 16, 1984 in West Hollywood, California from a rare case of lung cancer, aged 35. He was buried at Beth David Cemetery, Elmont, New York.

Kaufman allegedly told many people—including Bob Zmuda—that he wished to fake his own death. This had caused some fans to believe Kaufman was still alive when he died. Kaufman himself said that if he were to fake his death, he would return 20 years later, which would have been in 2004. Many of Kaufman's fans saw a picture that looks similar to that of Andy.

There is a website related to this theory, and, recently, "a grainy video has surfaced that purports to show Kaufman living under an assumed name in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

32 fouettés en tournant

32 fouettés en tournant is a movement in classical ballet. It is 32 "fouettés en tournant" performed without stopping.

One "fouetté rond de jambe en tournant" is an action where the dancer stands for a moment on flat foot with the supporting knee bent as the other "working" leg is whipped around to the side, creating the impetus to spin one turn. The working leg is then pulled in to touch the supporting knee as the dancer rises up "en pointe" on the supporting foot. 

32 fouettés were first performed by Pierina Legnani in Marius Petipa's "Cinderella" in 1893.

Konstantin Skalkovsky, the dance critic for the "St. Petersburg Gazette", went to the first performance of "Cinderella". He reported that "...in the last act Legnani positively outdid herself. When Emma Bessone danced the lead in "The Haarlem Tulip" she did 14 fouettés. In her variation Legnani performed 32 of them without stopping, and without travelling one inch! The public delightedly applauded the Ballerina and compelled her to repeat this variation as well. On the repetition she nevertheless did 28 fouettés. To count them became the favourite occupation of the public."

Legnani repeated this feat again in many other ballets during her career. She performed them as Odile in the "Black Swan Pas de Deux" from "Swan Lake" (1895).

Autism rights movement

The autism rights movement is a social movement that wants changes for autistic people and their caregivers. It wants the autism spectrum to be accepted by society as just a difference in ability to function in daily life. It does not believe autism is a mental disorder that needs to be cured.

The autism rights movement is sometimes controversial. It argues against the belief that most people with autism have low intelligence. Some people in the movement do not agree that this is true. There is fear that professionals, such as social workers, may try to prevent autistics from being married or having children. Also, people in the movement say that autistic people should not be treated differently from anyone else.

The movement has a variety of goals:

Autism rights activists are sometimes called neurodiversity activists. Neurodiversity is a word for how everyone's brains are different. Autistic people have different brains to people who do not have autism. People who do not have autism are called neurotypical people. The word 'neurodiversity' is preferred to 'autism' because it is not saying that autism is a medical condition. 'Neurotypical' is said instead of 'normal' because people think that normal means better.

Oral cancer

Oral cancer is cancer of any part of the mouth. It can start in the mouth, lips, or the oropharynx (the part of the throat at the back of the mouth).

A person can get oral cancer without having any other type of cancer. Oral cancer can also happen because of "metastasis". This means that the person had cancer in some other part of their body, and it spread to the mouth. The person's cancer may be far away from the mouth, or it may be in a part of the body near the mouth. For example, if a person has cancer of the nasal cavity, the cancer can spread to the mouth.

There are a few different types of oral cancers. But about 90% are squamous cell carcinomas. Squamous cells make up the main part of the outer layer of the skin. These cells line the lips, mouth, and throat. A "carcinoma" is a type of cancer that can start in these cells in the skin.

Squamous cell carcinomas most often start in the tongue. But they can also start in any other part of the mouth, including the floor of the mouth (under the tongue); the inside lining of the cheek; the gums; the lips; or the palate (the roof of the mouth).

Other oral cancers include:

Water scarcity

Water scarcity is a lack of fresh water. For us, and most land animals, fresh water is drinkable, and sea water is not. This is because sea water has a high salt content, which we and most land animals cannot deal with. 

The need is not just for fresh water, but for "clean water". That usually means water which is free of harmful bacteria and parasites and general dust and dirt. 

In the 1860s the English engineer Joseph Bazalgette organized the London sewers to keep water free of cholera. This was followed by British engineers designing similar waterworks in many countries round the world. Later population growth has increased the demand for fresh water beyond the scope of these original water systems. 

There are arid and desert areas, and places where the water is too polluted to drink. The situation has been made worse by population growth and industrial uses of water. Global warming tends to increase the need for fresh water for all land animals, including humans.

Therefore, water scarcity may be the result of both human and natural causes. Changes in climate and weather patterns can cause the availability of water to drop. Common human causes include over-consumption, bad governance, pollution, and increases in the demand for water.

Different terms are used to describe different types of water scarcity:

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that by 2025, 1.9 billion people will be living in countries or regions with total water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions. The World Bank has said that climate change could heavily change the future of water availability and use, and therefore increase water stress on a global scale.

Fresh water scarcity has negative effects on ecology, biodiversity, agriculture and human health. It has also led to armed conflicts in several cases. Some countries upriver have built dams to satisfy their needs for drinking water, irrigation and electric power. These needs have grown as populations has grown, and as climate changes has reduced rain in some places. Down river from the dam, supply is usually reduced. This creates tension between countries. The River Jordan in the Middle East, and the Nile are two good examples of where this is happening.

Banks was born on 16 February 1954 in Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland. He studied at University of Stirling. Banks was married to Annie Banks from 1992 until they separated in 2007. Then he was married to Adele Hartley from March 2013 until his death. He had no children. Politically he supported the Scottish Socialist Party. Banks died on 9 June 2013 from gallbladder cancer after being diagnosed in early April. He was 59 years old. 


The Little Colonel

The Little Colonel is a 1935 movie. It was directed by David Butler. The screenplay by William M. Conselman was adapted from a book of the same name by Annie Fellows Johnston. The movie features the famous staircase dance by Temple and Robinson.


Andre Sennwald in his "New York Times" review of March 22, 1935 wrote, "[a]ll adrip with magnolia whimsy and vast, unashamed portions of synthetic Dixie atmosphere". He further wrote that the movie was "so ruthless in its exploitation of Miss Temple's great talent for infant charm that it seldom succeeds in being properly lively and gay". He finished his review noting the audience applauded for a full eleven seconds after the final fade-out, and that the movie "ought to bring out the best in every one who sees it."


Curly Top

Curly Top is a 1935 musical movie starring Shirley Temple. It was directed by Irving Cummings. It is loosely based on the 1912 children's book "Daddy-Long-Legs" by Jean Webster. The movie tells the story of an orphan adopted by a rich man. Temple introduced one of her signature songs, "Animal Crackers in My Soup", in the movie.

"Curly Top" was a box office hit, but it was banned in Denmark for unspecified "corruption". In China, Madame Chiang Kai-shek asked for repeated private showings.


The Little Princess

The Little Princess is a 1939 movie. It was directed by Walter Lang. It stars Shirley Temple. It is loosely based on the book "A Little Princess" by Frances Hodgson Burnett. It was the first Shirley Temple movie to be filmed completely in Technicolor. It was also her last major success as a child star.


Captain Crewe is called to fight in the Second Boer War. He leaves his daughter Sara at Miss Minchin's School for Girls. One day, his lawyer arrives in the school with news that Captain Crewe has died and his real estate has been confiscated. Sara is now a poor orphan. She becomes a servant in the school. Sara tires of her servant duties. She sneaks off to Veterans Hospital, convinced her father is not dead. She finds him wounded. They reunite joyfully.

According to "Variety", "Transposition of the Frances Hodgson Burnett several-generation favorite, Sara Crewe, is accomplished most successfully. The fairy-tale story is still saccharine to the nth degree, but once the basic premise is established, it rolls along acceptably. And, while the story has been changed for screen purposes, the general line is close enough."

Benjamin R. Crisler reviewed the film when it opened in New York City at the Roxy Theatre. He wrote, "With any other child on earth, it is amazing to reflect, "The Little Princess" would stand out as one of the most glaring exhibits of pure hokum in screen history; with Mistress Temple, it may very well be, as Mr. Zanuck unflinchingly proclaims, the greatest picture with which Mr. Zanuck has ever been associated."

Janet Maslin, writing for "The New York Times" 44 years later, called it "antiquated enough to seem charming" and concludes "[t]he movie's music, its corny but likable histrionics and its rousing patriotism (it was made in 1939) culminate in a happy ending sure to make even grown-up viewers cry."


Gouache

Gouache, also spelled guache, is a type of paint. It is also commonly called poster paint. It comprises pigment, a binding agent (usually gum arabic), and some additives to make it opaque. An inert white pigment such as chalk is usually added. Gouache covers up whatever is underneath. Water colours, in contrast, are somewhat transparent.

After gouache has dried, any form of paint can be used on the surface, also pastels and crayons. Watercolours on top of a gouache surface are not so runny (fluid) as they are on plain paper. 

The fast-drying quality of gouache makes it a favourite for "en plein air" (outdoor) paintings. It was also a favourite of J. M. W. Turner. 

Gouache also refers to paintings that use this type of paint.

Acrylic paint

Acrylic paint is a fast-drying paint containing pigment in an acrylic polymer emulsion. Acrylic paints can be diluted with water, but are water-resistant when dry. Depending on how much the paint is diluted (with water) or modified with acrylic gels, media, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a watercolor or an oil painting, or have its own unique appearance.

Acrylic paint can give a much brighter, more vivid colour than oil paints. It has been much used in modern art, and is cheaper than oil paint, which is rather an expensive material. When dry, acrylic paint usually cannot be removed from a solid surface. 

The Drying time of Acrylic Paints. Galeria Acrylic: Thin color films dry in 10 to 20 minutes, whereas more significant films might take an hour or more to dry. Professional Acrylic: Thin coats dry in 20 to 30 minutes, but more significant layers might take an hour or two. 

In 1934, a German chemical company created acrylic resin. It was first used in the 1940s. Acrylics were commercially available as paint for artists in the 1950s. Later, many advances were made to acrylic paint as more and more people began using it.

ʻIolani Palace

Iolani Palace is a building in downtown Honolulu, Hawaii, United States. It was a palace for the kings and queens of Hawaii. It is the only palace in the United States that was used as an official residence by a reigning monarch. Two monarchs governed from Iolani Palace. They were King Kalākaua and Queen Liliuokalani. After Hawaii stopped having kings and queens in 1893, the building was used as the state's capitol building until 1969.

In 1962, Iolani Palace became a National Historic Landmark. The palace was restored and opened to the public as a museum in 1978.

Iolani Palace was built when the king of Hawaii was David Kalākaua. Kalākaua had seen royal palaces in Europe. He had Iolani Palace designed to be like those. It was built of brick and concrete. The building was completed in November 1882. It cost over $340,000. It measures about . It is two stories high. It has a basement. It has four corner towers. It has two towers in the center that are high.

Iolani Palace is the only building of its architectural style. The style is called "American Florentine". The palace had electricity and telephones even before the White House had them.

After Hawaii stopped having kings and queens in 1893, the new government of Hawaii took over Iolani Palace. The palace was renamed the "Executive Building" for the Republic of Hawaii. Officials made a record of what was in the building. The things that could not be used by the new government were sold at public auctions.

Queen Liliuokalani was imprisoned for nine months in a small room on the upper floor after a rebellion in 1895. The quilt she made is still there.

In 1930, the inside of Iolani Palace was remodeled. The wood framing was replaced by steel and reinforced concrete. In 1935, the name was changed back to Iolani Palace.

Iolani Palace was made an official National Historic Landmark on December 29, 1962. On October 15, 1966, it was added as site 66000293 to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Oahu. Government offices left the Palace in 1969 and moved to the new Hawaii State Capitol building.

Many things that used to be in the palace have been returned. Money from the government and private donations paid to help make rooms in the palace look like they did during the monarchy era. Iolani Palace opened to the public in 1978. In the basement is a photographic display of the Palace, the Hawaiian crown jewels, awards given by the monarchs, and regalia worn by the high chiefs of the islands.

The grounds of Iolani Palace are managed by the Hawaii State Department of Land and Natural Resources. The palace building itself is managed as a historical house museum by the Friends of Iolani Palace, a non-profit non-governmental organization. The birthdays of King Kalākaua (November 16) and Queen Kapiolani (December 28) are celebrated with ceremonies.


Gesso

Gesso is a primer or foundation for art painting on wood or canvas. It is a white paint mixture. It has a binder mixed with a pigment. Traditionally, the binder is glue or gelatin, the pigment is chalk, plaster or gypsum. 

Gesso is used in art to prepare a surfaces (wood panels, canvas and sculpture) for painting. Paint and/or other materials are applied on top of the gesso. One reason for covering the surface with gesso is that wood or canvas has a rough or uneven surface, and a colour. Gesso "priming" lets the artist's chosen subject show more clearly than it would otherwise. 

Even if a surface has no roughness, many artists still prime it before starting the painting proper, though they might use a paint or "wash" of their own choosing. They do this because the primer, though it cannot be seen directly, may change and help the quality of light reflected from the surface. Gesso, however, is specially useful for a rough or uneven surface. 

Acrylic gesso, a widely used "ground", is a modern version which is cheaper and easier to use than the traditional type of gesso. It is a combination of calcium carbonate with an acrylic polymer medium latex, a pigment and other chemicals to ensure flexibility and increase life. It is technically not "gesso" at all.

"The Painter's Handbook" notes a problem with using oil paints over an acrylic gesso ground instead of a traditional oil ground, citing a mismatch in flexibility over time that could cause the oil paint to delaminate (flake off).

John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern first described game theory. Other people known for their work in game theory include Émile Borel.

Archimedes' screw

Archimedes' screw is a machine. It is a type of pump used for raising water up. It is a screw inside a fairly tight-fitting cylinder. With the bottom end in water, the screw lifts water up to the top, where it pours out of a spout. The screw can be turned by hand, or by a windmill, or by an engine. The screw is often used for filling irrigation ditches.

Archimedes wrote about it when he was in Alexandria, Egypt. It is not known for certain whether he did invent it, but it is always attributed to him. The Archimedes screw is still much in use all over the world.

There is also a kind of reverse Archimedes' screw. Water poured in on top turns the screw. The turning drives an electric generator, which makes electricity. It is good for rivers with modest water drops ('low heads'). The reverse screw has the same benefits as using the screw for pumping: it can handle very dirty water and widely varying rates of flow, with high efficiency.


Ezra

Ezra (; , "Ezra"; fl. 480–440 BC), is a highly respected figure in Judaism.

He is called Ezra the Scribe (, "Ezra ha-Sofer") and Ezra the Priest in the Book of Ezra. In an early Greek translation of the bible, the Septuagint, the name is written as "Esdras" (), from which comes . His name may be an abbreviation of "", "God-helps".

In Islam he is known as Uzair (). He was mentioned in the Qur'an.

The "Book of Ezra" and "Book of Nehemiah" are the oldest sources for the history of Ezra. Many of the other books they say are written by Ezra (First Esdras, 3-6 Ezra) are written after that. Those books take the story from the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.

Ezra was a member of the family of Seraiah the high priest. He lived in Babylon when in the seventh year (~ 457 BCE) of Artaxerxes, king of Persia, the king sent him to Jerusalem to teach the laws of God to any who did not know them.

Ezra led a large group of exiles back to Jerusalem. He discovered that Jewish men had been marrying non-Jewish women. He worked to stop this from happening again.

Some years later the king Artaxerxes sent a Jewish nobleman, Nehemiah, to Jerusalem. He had to rebuild the city walls. Once this was done, Nehemiah asked Ezra to read the Law of Moses (the Torah) to the people. The people and priests agreed to keep to this law and to separate themselves from all other peoples.

The second book of Esdras was written a lot later, c. AD 100. In this book, Ezra talks with an angel or God three times and has four visions. At the end, he is taken up to heaven like Enoch and Elijah. Ezra is seen as a new Moses in this book.

Judaism believes Ezra started the Great Assembly of scholars and prophets. Later, this would become the Sanhedrin, the authority when it comes to religious law.

It is said that Ezra was the writer of the Books of Chronicles.

His tomb at Al-ʻUzair on the banks of the Tigris near Basra, Iraq, is a pilgrimage site for the local Marsh Arabs.

Turkana boy

Turkana boy, or Nariokotome boy, is the fossil KNM-WT 15000. It is a nearly complete skeleton of a hominid who died in the early Pleistocene 1.5 million years ago (mya), near present-day Lake Turkana in northwest Kenya. This specimen is the "most complete early human skeleton ever found". It was first classified as "Homo erectus"; after much heated debate, it was re-classified as "Homo ergaster".

His age at death has been estimated from 7 years six months to as old as 15 years. The most recent scientific review suggests 8 years of age. It was first thought that he would have grown to 1.85 m tall, but recently a height of 1.63 m was proposed. Research showed that his growth differed from that of modern humans: he would have had a shorter and smaller adolescent growth spurt.

The skeleton was discovered in 1984 by Kamoya Kimeu, a member of a team led by Richard Leakey, at Nariokotome near Lake Turkana in northwest Kenya.

The shape of the pelvis identifies that the specimen was a male. His estimated age at death depends upon whether the maturity stage of his teeth or skeletal is used, and whether that maturity is compared to that of modern humans or chimpanzees.

A key factor here is that while modern humans have a marked adolescent growth spurt, chimpanzees do not. While initial research assumed a modern human type of growth, more recent evidence from other fossils suggests this was less present in early "Homo". This affects the estimation of both his age and his likely stature as a fully grown adult.

The pelvis is narrower than in "Homo sapiens", which might indicate more efficient running, whether to run down small game or to avoid predators. The Boy was relatively tall, which would have increased his surface area and helped him to lose heat.

Body hair may also have been thinner to hasten cooling. Body hair was lost in the shift towards savanna living. In equatorial Africa, modern humans evolved this trait an estimated one million years ago.

The skeleton still had features (such as a low sloping forehead, strong brow ridges, and the absence of a chin) not seen in "H. sapiens". The arms were slightly longer. Turkana Boy had a projecting nose rather than the open flat nose seen in apes.

Some of the Preludes were written during Chopin and George Sand's stay at a monastery in Valldemossa, Majorca in 1838. In her "Histoire de ma vie", Sand told how one evening she and her son Maurice, returning from Palma, Majorca, in a terrible rainstorm, found a frantic Chopin who cried, "Ah! I knew well that you were dead." While playing his piano he had a dream:
"He saw himself drowned in a lake. Heavy drops of icy water fell in a regular rhythm on his breast, and when I made him listen to the sound of the drops of water indeed falling in rhythm on the roof, he denied having heard it. He was even angry that I should interpret this in terms of imitative sounds. He protested with all his might – and he was right to – against the childishness of such aural imitations. His genius was filled with the mysterious sounds of nature, but transformed into sublime equivalents in musical thought, and not through slavish imitation of the actual external sounds."

Sand did not say which prelude Chopin played for her at that time. Most music critics think it was no. 15, because of the repeating A flat, with its suggestion of the "gentle patter" of rain. Peter Dayan points out that Sand accepted Chopin's protests that the prelude was not an "imitation" of the sound of raindrops, but a "translation" of nature's harmonies within Chopin's "génie". Frederick Niecks says that the prelude "rises before one's mind the cloistered court of the monastery of Valdemosa, and a procession of monks chanting lugubrious prayers, and carrying in the dark hours of night their departed brother to his last resting-place.

The prelude opens with a "serene" theme in D flat. It then changes to a "lugubrious interlude" in C sharp minor, "with the dominant pedal never ceasing, a basso ostinato". The repeating A flat, which has been heard throughout the first section, here becomes more insistent. Following this, the prelude ends with a repetition of the original theme. Niecks says, "This C sharp minor portion...affects one like an oppressive dream; the re-entrance of the opening D flat major, which dispels the dreadful nightmare, comes upon one with the smiling freshness of dear, familiar nature – only after these horrors of the imagination can its serene beauty be fully appreciated.

GSSP

A GSSP, more fully a Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point, is an internationally agreed point which defines the start of a stage on the geologic time scale.

The work is done by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, a part of the International Union of Geological Sciences. As of 2012, 64 of the 101 stages that need a GSSP have been decided.

A geologic section has to follow the rules to be adapted as a GSSP by the ICS. The list below are the rules:


This list shows some of the GSSPs.

Because defining a GSSP depends on finding well-preserved geologic sections and identifying key events, this task becomes more harder as one goes farther back in time. Before 640 million years ago, boundaries on the geologic timescale are defined simply by reference to fixed dates, known as "Global Standard Stratigraphic Ages". The oldest GSSP is the one that marks the start of the Ediacaran at 635 million years ago.

Neurodiversity

Neurodiversity is a word for differences in people's brains. It is a type of biodiversity (diversity in living creatures).

Examples of neurodiverse conditions include autism, Tourette syndrome, ADHD, and dyslexia.

The neurodiversity movement is an approach to mental disability in which some neurological conditions are variations of the human brain. The term was first used in the late 1990s as a challenge to the idea that neurological differences are disorders instead of features. The movement believes that these variations should be recognised as a social category along with gender, human race and sexual orientation.

Some people claim that neurodiversity would not be good for individuals with severe disabilities, such as low-functioning autism. They state that the difficulties are far greater than any potential strengths.

May Disease describes this common feeling of disappointment or being let down.

Gravitational field

In physics, a gravitational field is a model used to explain the influence that a massive body has. The influence extends into the space around itself, producing a force on another massive body. Thus, a gravitational field is used to explain gravitational phenomena (effects). It is measured in newtons per kilogram (N/kg). 

In the original Newtonian concept, gravity was a force between point masses. Following Newton, Laplace attempted to model gravity as some kind of radiation field or fluid. Since the 19th century explanations for gravity have in terms of a field model, rather than a point attraction. This revolution was brought about by Einstein's general theory of relativity. Most scientists believe that the gravitational field and its gravitational waves are the physical interpretations of Einstein's equations of general relativity.

In a field model, rather than two particles attracting each other, the mass of objects distort spacetime. This distortion is what is perceived and measured as a "force". In such a model matter moves in certain ways in response to the curvature of spacetime. One can say either "there is no gravitational force", or that "gravity is a fictitious force".

Asparagus officinalis

Asparagus officinalis is a perennial from the genus "Asparagus" of the Asparagaceae family. It is commonly grown as a vegetable, eaten in spring. When people talk about Asparagus as a vegetable, they usually mean this plant. It was once classified in the lily family, like its "Allium" cousins, onions and garlic, but the Liliaceae have been split and the onion-like plants are now in the family Amaryllidaceae and asparagus in the Asparagaceae. "Asparagus officinalis" is native to most of Europe, northern Africa and western Asia, A. officinalis is widely cultivated as a vegetable crop.

Allium

Allium is a genus of flowering plants. It contains garlic, leek, onions and chives. There are hundreds of species, some of which have been cultivated for much of human history. Today, about a dozen species are economically important. The type species of the genus is "Allium sativum", commonly known as "garlic". The taxonomy of "Allium" is difficult, because the boundaries between species are often unclear. For this reason, the number of recognised species varies between 260, and 860. Most people think there are about 750 species.

Marimekko

Marimekko is a textile design company. It was started in 1951 in Finland. It is famous for its original prints, for instance, prints of red and blue flowers. The company makes high-quality items, not only furnishing fabrics to tableware but also clothes, bags and other accessories. Its fabrics have been introduced inside the airplanes of Finnair.


Environmental economics

Environmental economics is a domain of economics that looks at problems of the environment from an economical perspective. Natural resources, such as clean water are limited, because of pollution. They are also seen as "free" public goods. This means that if there are no rules on how to use these goods, they will be used too much. There are externalities for using these goods, and there is the problem of free riders. In this perspective, the solution is to convert these resources into economic goods, which are integrated in the market. This will lessen the problem of free-riding, and give incentives to use these goods sparingly. An example for this is a tax which is tied to pollution. Proper legislation and observation of property right on how to regulate the use of these public goods is also another important factor in ensuring that market inefficiencies don't result.


Kate Flannery

Katherine Patricia "Kate" Flannery (born June 10, 1964) is an American actress. She acts mostly on television. She played Meredith Palmer in the NBC sitcom "The Office". Flannery was born in Philadelphia.

Free rider problem

In economics, the term free rider refers to someone who benefits from resources, goods, or services without paying for the cost of the benefit. The term "free rider" was first used in economic theory of public goods, but similar concepts have been applied in to other contexts, such as collective bargaining, antitrust law, psychology and political science. Free riding may be considered as a free rider problem when it leads to under-provision of goods or services, or when it leads to overuse or degradation of a common property resource. 

Although the term originated in economic theory, similar concepts have been cited in political science, social psychology, and other disciplines. Some individuals in a team or community may reduce their contributions or performance if they believe that one or more other members of the group may free ride.

Gauss-Bonnet theorem

The Gauss-Bonnet theorem is a theorem that connects the geometry of a shape with its topology. It is named after the two mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauß (1777-1855) and Pierre Ossian Bonnet (1812-1872) who both found it, independently of one another. The Curvature of the shape is used, as well as its Euler characteristic.

Bangladesh–Russia relations

Relations between Bangladesh and Russia. Russia has an embassy in Dhaka and Bangladesh has an embassy in Moscow. Diplomatic relations were established on 25 January 1972, when Russia was the Soviet Union.

Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has visited Russia twice to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The first time was in 2009 and then in 2013.

Relations between the Soviet Union and Bangladesh were good in the years immediately after Bangladesh's independence in 1971. The Soviet Union supported Indian actions in aiding the war of liberation, and after the war the Soviet Navy sent a floating workshop to Bangladesh for clearing Pakistani mines from the Chittagong and Chalna harbors. Mujib visited Moscow in 1972, and high-level officials from both countries made numerous reciprocal visits until 1975. The Soviets supported the socialist programs of the Mujib government and its very exceptionally close ties with India. Early Soviet aid was limited, however. During the first four months of its existence, Bangladesh received economic aid worth US$142 million from India, but only US$6 million from the Soviet Union.

It also believed that the Communist Party of Bangladesh was funded and supported in the erstwhile volatile region of the former "East Pakistan" since then it was part of a United Pakistan itself allied with the United States and the China which were hostile towards rival Soviet Union, the party itself was based on the idealogical principals of Marxism.

Bangladeshi-Soviet relations rapidly improved in 1984 and regained a level of cordiality in the mid- and late 1980s. In 1985 the Soviet Cultural Centre reopened in Dhaka. In 1986 a Soviet special envoy visited Dhaka, and later the Bangladeshi foreign minister visited Moscow. Although Soviet aid to Bangladesh was still small compared with assistance from Japan, the United States, or even China, by 1987 Bangladesh had entered into sixteen different economic accords with the Soviet Union. Soviet assistance has concentrated on the energy sector, especially several power plants at Ghorasal, near Dhaka.

The White Guard

The White Guard () is a novel by the 20th century Ukrainian writer Mikhail Bulgakov. His later work "The Master and Margarita" brought him posthumous fame.

"The White Guard" first appeared in serial form in the Soviet-era literary journal "Rossiya" in 1925, but the magazine was closed down before the serial was completed. It was not reprinted in Russia until 1966.

After the first two parts of "The White Guard" were published in "Rossiya", Bulgakov was invited to write a version for the stage. He called the play "The Days of the Turbins." This was produced at the Moscow Art Theatre, to great acclaim:

In fact, the play completely overshadowed the book, which was in any event virtually unobtainable in any form.

Since Bulgakov was refused permission to publish his most important works, he pleaded with Stalin to be allowed to leave the country. Stalin personally arranged for a job for him at the Moscow Arts Theatre. Bulgakov was still writing and re-writing his uncompleted novel, "The Master And Margarita", when he died in 1940.

His widow had "The White Guard" published in large part in the literary journal "Moskva" in 1966, at the end of the Krushchev era. This was the basis for the English translation by Michael Glenny published in 1971 (New York: McGraw-Hill; London: Collins; reissued 2005 by Academy Chicago Publishers. This lacks the dream flashback sections. In 2008 Yale University Press published a translation by Marian Schwartz of the complete novel, an edition which won an award.

Set in the Ukraine, beginning in late 1918, the novel concerns the fate of the Turbin family as the various armies of the Russian Civil War the Whites, the Reds, the Imperial German Army, and Ukrainian nationalists – fight over the city of Kiev. Historical figures such as Petlyura and Pavlo Skoropadsky appear as the Turbin family is caught up in the effects of the October Revolution.


The novel contains many autobiographical elements. Bulgakov gave the younger Turbin brother some of the characteristics of his own younger brother. The description of the house of the Turbins is that of the house of the Bulgakov family in Kiev. (Today it is preserved and operated as the Mikhail Bulgakov Museum).

Edward Snowden

Edward Joseph Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American-Russian former contractor who worked for the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States. He released top secret NSA documents proving the United States Government was monitoring phone calls, emails, webcams of its own citizens. His job at the NSA allowed him access to them. He has said, "I do not want to live in a world where anything I do or say is recorded."

Snowden traveled to Moscow after giving the documents to American journalists in Hong Kong. He had asylum in Russia for one year. Then he was granted permission to stay in the country for three more years. This has increased tensions between Russia and the United States. In October 2020 he was granted permanent residency in Russia.

In 2013 Snowden was voted Person of the Year by "The Guardian".

After Snowden published information that pointed to mass surveillance by the US government, NPR reported sales of the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell had gone up.

Dora Baltea

Dora Baltea or Doire Baltée ( or "Duria Bautica"; Valdôtain dialect: "Djouire"; Piemontes: "Deura Bàotia"), is a river in northern Italy. It is a left-hand tributary of the Po River, and is about long.

Dora Baltea is formed on the Mont Blanc by the confluence, near Entrèves, of two small rivers: Dora di Ferret, that comes from the Pré de Bar Glacier in Val Ferret; and Dora di Veny, that comes from the Miage Glacier in Val Veny.
As it crosses the Aosta Valley, the Dora Baltea flows through the city of Aosta (where the Buthier, a small river, runs into it) and near all the main cities of the lower Aosta Valley: Châtillon, Saint-Vincent, Verrès and Pont-Saint-Martin. After it enters the Piedmont region, it passes through the city of Ivrea and a good part of Canavese, gets from its right hand the waters of the Chiusella and reaches the Po at Crescentino.

The watershed has an area of , and its discharge (volume of water which passes through a section of the river per unit of time) is 96 cubic metres per second when it gets to the Po river.

The main tributaries of the Dora Baltea are (beginning at the source):


The mean monthly discharges (in m³) for the years 1951-1991 in the confluence with the Po river were:

Dora Baltea is a popular place for the practice of sports like canoeing, kayaking and similar water sports.

Blohm &amp; Voss Bv 142

The Blohm & Voss Bv 142 was a German reconnaissance aircraft of World War II. Its maiden flight was in October 1938. It was built at the beginning like an airliner. But just one was used by Lufthansa. The others were used by Luftwaffe for far reconnaissance. Fragile and unwieldy, it was stopped in 1942, just two years after it commissioned. Only four examples were built.

Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction

The Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction (often shortened to "BZR" or "BZ") is an example of a chemical oscillator. It is often used to illustrate a chaotic system. The BZR is made of several chemical reactions, that occur in sequence. It shows chemical oscillation, which is unusual for chemical reactions. At first it was thought to be a measurement error, or an artifact. It was thought that according to the Second law of thermodynamics, this should not occur. According to this law, a system that is in an unordered state will not assume an ordered state on its own, that is without the provision of energy. However, this is only applicable in a closed system, and does not apply to the BZ reaction.

The reactions are theoretically important because they show that chemical reactions do not have to be dominated by equilibrium thermodynamic behavior. These reactions are far from equilibrium and remain so for a significant length of time. In this sense, they provide an interesting chemical model of nonequilibrium biological phenomena. The mathematical models of the BZ reactions themselves are of theoretical interest.

An essential aspect of the BZ reaction is called"excitability": under the influence of stimuli, patterns develop in what would otherwise be a perfectly calm medium. Some clock reactions such as Briggs–Rauscher and BZ using the tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride as catalyst can be made to show self-organising activity through the influence of light.

Similar processes were already known in the 19th century. Wilhelm Ostwald gave a detailed account in 1899 and 1900, describing the oscillations of Chrome in Hydrochloric acid and of iron in Nitric acid. Boris Pavlovich Belousov accidentally discovered the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction in the 1950s. Ilya Prigogine was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977. His research focused on systems which were far away from an equilibrium state, the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction was included. Beloussow was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1980, after his death. The Lenin prize was the highest distinction for scientific achievement in the Soviet Union.

Moomins

The Moomins () are the main characters in a series of books and a comic strip by Swedish-speaking Finnish illustrator and writer Tove Jansson, originally published in Swedish by Schildts in Finland. 

They are a family of white, roundish fairy tale characters with large snouts that make them look like hippopotamuses. The carefree and adventurous family live in their house in Moominvalley, though in the past, their part-time residences have included a lighthouse and a theatre. They have had many adventures along with their various friends.

In all, nine books were released in the series, together with five picture books and a comic strip being released between 1945 and 1993.

The Moomins have since been the subject for many television series, movies and even a theme park called Moomin World in Naantali, Finland.

Anggun

Anggun Cipta Sasmi ( [aŋˈɡun ˈt͡ʃipta ˈsasmi]; born 29 April 1974) is an Indonesian and French-naturalised singer-songwriter. Born in Jakarta, she began performing at the age of seven and recorded a children's album two years later. With the help of famed Indonesian producer Ian Antono, in 1986 Anggun released her first rock-influenced studio album, "Dunia Aku Punya". She became further well known with the single "Mimpi" (1989), which was listed as one of the 150 Greatest Indonesian Songs of All Time by "Rolling Stone". She followed it with a series of singles and three more studio albums, which established her as one of the most prominent Indonesian rock stars of the early 1990s.

Anggun left Indonesia in 1994 to pursue an international career. After two years struggling in London and Paris, Anggun met French producer Erick Benzi and signed to Sony Music Entertainment. Her first international album, "Snow on the Sahara" (1997), was released in 33 countries and became the best-selling album by an Asian artist outside Asia. The album spawned her signature hit "Snow on the Sahara", which reached number one in several countries. Since her international breakthrough, Anggun has released five English-language studio albums and six French-language studio albums, as well as a soundtrack album to the Danish film "Open Hearts" (2002). She represented France in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Baku, Azerbaijan, with the song "Echo (You and I)". She joined the judging panel of talent shows "X Factor Indonesia" (2013) and "Asia's Got Talent" (2015); the former made her the highest-paid judge in Indonesian television history.

Anggun is the Asian artist with the highest album sales outside Asia, with her releases being certified gold and platinum in some European countries. She is the first Indonesian artist to have success in European and American record charts. She has received a number of accolades for her achievements, including the Chevalier des Arts et Lettres from the Government of France and the World Music Award for World's Best-Selling Indonesian Artist. Aside from her musical career, Anggun has been involved in numerous environmental and humanitarian works. She has been appointed as the global ambassador of the United Nations twice, first for the International Year of Microcredit in 2005 and then for the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 2009 onwards.

Samuel Fuller

Samuel Fuller (1580 - 1633) was a passenger on the 1620 voyage of the Pilgrim ship "Mayflower" and singed the Mayflower Compact. He became a respected church deacon and the physician for Plymouth Colony.

Fuller was a son of Robert Fuller, a butcher. He was baptized on January 20, 1580 at Redenhall, co. Norfolk, England. He was a member of the Separatist religion which was not allowed in England.

In 1610, Fuller moved to Leiden, Netherlands. He was a friend of Degory Priest and Sarah Allerton. Sarah was the sister of Isaac Allerton. Fuller was an active church congregation member. In Leiden records Fuller was referred to as “a serge worker of London.” 

Samuel’s wife and son died in 1615 and he married Bridget Lee.

Samuel Fuller helped to plan for the Separatists to move to the Colony of Virginia. They made an agreement with the Virginia Company. Fuller, along with Edward Winslow, William Bradford and Isaac Allerton, sent a letter on June 10, 1620 to John Carver and Robert Cushman. These men were in London and were also making plans for the voyage. They learned that Thomas Weston and the Company had changed the agreement. One of the changes was that the merchants would keep half of the houses and lands. The pilgrims would also have one day off from work per week. These problems were not solved until Robert Cushman arrived in the "Fortune" in November 1621.

Samuel Fuller learned about medicine before he traveled to the New World so that he could help the others if needed. There would be no doctor on the "Mayflower" or at Plymouth Colony.

It is said that the town of Fullerton, North Dakota, is named after Samuel Fuller.

Samuel Fuller boarded the "Mayflower" with only his servant William Butten, leaving his wife behind in Leiden until he could get settled. William Butten died before the "Mayflower" landed.

The Mayflower left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the "Mayflower" spotted land. They landed on 21 November and wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other. The "Mayflower" was supposed to land in the Colony of Virginia, but the ship was damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor.

Samuel's wife came on the ship "Anne" and in a few years Samuel would receive two acres of Land. His wife Bridget received one acre of land near a pond. In 1627, Samuel and his wife received several livestock for their farm.

In 1629, a group of people arrived led by John Endicott. They became sick and Fuller was sent to assist them. Endicott sent a letter of thanks to William Bradford. He also helped people at Charleston when they were sick.

Not everyone thought Fuller was a good doctor. In 1637, Thomas Morton, wrote a letter calling Fuller a quacksalver which is where the word "quack" comes from. 

In the summer of 1633, Fuller fell ill with a sickness that had spread through Plymouth. Author Nathaniel Morton wrote about Samuel Fuller’s in his 1669 New England’s Memorial. He praised Fuller and his work.

Fuller was married two times. He married Sarah Dunthorne who was probably born in England in 1584. His second wife was Bridget Lee who died in 1667. He and Bridget had four children: Mercy and Samuel, Jr., unknown female and Elizabeth.

Samuel Fuller made out his will in 1633. He said he was sick and weak. Samuel Fuller died in 1633.

The burial place of Samuel Fuller is unknown.


Airbus A300

The Airbus A300 is a jet airliner which was made by Airbus. Airbus Industries launched the plane in 1972, and it was the first plane with two engines to have more than one aisle between the seats (the first twin-engined wide-body aircraft). The A300 can hold 266 passengers in two classes. It can fly for a maximum of when it is full, but this depends on the type of A300.

Air France was the first airline to get an A300. Air France began to use its A300s on 30 May 1974. Airbus stopped making A300s in July 2007. When Airbus stopped making A300s, it also stopped making A310s. The freighter version of the A300 has been replaced by the A330-200F.

In 1966, Frank Kolk, a member of American Airlines, asked for a plane to replace the Boeing 727. He wanted a plane which could hold 250 to 300 passengers, with two engines. American plane makers made planes with three engines, like the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar, because the FAA had banned planes with two engines from flying on certain routes.

In September 1967, the British, French, and German governments agreed to begin designing the Airbus A300, which would have 300 seats.

After this agreement, both the French and British governments were worried about the plane. The plane needed a new type of engine from Rolls-Royce, the RB207. In December 1968, the French and British companies (Sud Aviation and Hawker Siddeley) thought of a different design: the Airbus A250, which would have 250 seats. This design had its name changed to the A300B, and it did not need a new type of engine, which saved money. To get more U.S. airlines to buy the plane, American General Electric CF6-50 engines were used for the A300 instead of Rolls-Royce engines. The British government was upset and decided to stop supporting the A300. However, Hawker-Siddeley did not leave, and designed the wings for the A300.

In 1972, the A300 flew for the first time. The first type of A300 to be made, the A300B2, began to be used by airlines in 1974. The A300B4 began to be used one year later. At first, Airbus Industrie did not sell many planes. However, by 1979, 81 aircraft were being used. It was the A320 which made Airbus the very big company that it is today.

Parts of the A300 were made by many different companies from all over Europe. These were taken to Toulouse-Blagnac by some Aero Spacelines Super Guppy aircraft so that the parts could all be put together to make the plane. This method turned out to be much better than simply building the aircraft in one place. 

Some of the technology used for the Airbus A300 was taken from Concorde. When it began being used in 1974, the A300 was an advanced plane. Some advanced features were:

A300s made later have other features, like:

The A300 did not sell very well at first. Most of the orders were from airlines of countries which made up Airbus Industrie, like Air France and Lufthansa.

In 1974, Korean Air ordered 4 A300s. This made it the first airline outside of Europe to order an Airbus Industrie plane. Airbus Industrie thought that South-East-Asia was a good place to sell planes. It also thought that Korean Air was the 'key' to selling planes in that area.

Airlines which used the A300 to fly on short flights needed to have fewer flights so that the aircraft could be filled, so these airlines lost customers to other airlines which used smaller aircraft and had flights more often. Eventually, Airbus had to make the A320 to rival the Boeing 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9/MD-80.

In 1977, Eastern Air Lines leased four A300s. Frank Borman, who was the CEO of Eastern, was happy that the A300 used much less fuel than the planes the airline already had. He ordered 23 A300s. After this, Pan Am also ordered some A300s. From then on, many A300s were sold, and 878 planes were given to airlines.

The body of the A300 was made longer (on the A330 and A340), shorter (on the A310), or was changed (for the A300-600ST "Beluga" Super Transporter).

In March 2006, Airbus said that it was no longer making the A300/A310. The last A300 first flew on 18 April 2007. It was delivered to FedEx on 12 July 2007.

Only two of these were built: the prototype, and a second aircraft. It can hold 300 passengers or 323 passengers, and it has two General Electric CF6-50A engines.

The first version to be made for airlines. It had General Electric CF6 or Pratt & Whitney JT9D engines. Air France was the first airline to use it, in May 1974.

The version which was made the most. The first A300B4 made its first flight on 25 December 1974. Germanair got the first one on 23 May 1975.

This type's official name is the A300B4-600. It has more powerful CF6-80 or Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines, and it has the Honeywell 331-250 auxiliary power unit (APU). The A300-600 began being used in 1983 by Saudi Arabian Airlines The A300-600 also has a different cockpit (similar to the A310), so the flight engineer was not needed for this type.

This type is shorter and does not need a flight engineer. 
It can also be used as a military plane. It is currently being used by the Canadian Forces and German Air Force. 260 of these planes were sold, but five of these were never made.

As of 2010, the A300 has had 54 accidents. There have been 26 hull-losses. 1,434 people have died on A300s. A hull-loss accident is an accident where the plane is completely destroyed, or if it is damaged so much that it cannot be fixed.

As of July 2020, there are more than 200 A300s still flying.

Electroencephalography

Electroencephalography is a way to record certain patterns of brain activity, on the skin of the head. Nerve cells use electricity to transmit information. It is one of the methods of diagnosis which can be used for conditions that affect the nerves. An electroencephalogram is a recorded electroencephalography. Both are abbreviated EEG. Electroencephalography is used to detect epilepsy, coma, sleep and brain death. Special adaptations exists to research sleep, for example the length of sleep rhythms. Sleep occurs in different phases, the specially adapted EEG can show the length of these phases.

One way that scientists study EEG recordings is by looking at different waves in the EEG. These waves do not move across the body, but occur as changes in the signal at one place over time. They are studied using mathematical techniques for separating a signal into different frequencies. The slowest waves are called delta, and they occur at 1 to 4 cycles per second. Delta occurs in sleep and during anesthesia. The next frequency is called theta, and it occurs at 4 to 8 cycles per second. Theta is seen when a person is trying to keep many different things, such as numbers or words, in memory. It is also seen when a person is drowsy. After theta comes alpha, a wave occurring at 8 to 12 cycles per second. Alpha is seen over the back of the head when a person has his or her eyes shut. It is also seen when a person is resting or meditating. Faster than alpha is beta, a wave that occurs at 12 to 30 cycles per second. It is seen when a person is getting ready to move or no longer resting. It is also seen when a person takes benzodiazepine drugs. Finally, gamma is the fastest wave seen in EEG, occurring at 30 to 100 cycles per second. It is seen when a person is thinking or paying attention to something. 

Book of Shadows

The Book of Shadows is a mix of religious text and personal diary content caried by many Wiccans. Gerald Gardner started the idea and said Wiccans should write down rituals and magical instructions inside.


Regional language

A regional language is a language spoken in an area that is part of a larger nation state.

Internationally, the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, ""regional or minority languages" means languages that are:"

A regional language is, in terms of political status, different from the official language of the country where it is spoken. The regional languages are sometimes recognized and protected by the regional government or the state: many states across the world recognize regional languages, and give them a status, as is the case, for example, of Wallonia, Spain, Italy or Switzerland. In other cases the state does not grant official status as an official language of the country; it is the case with the regional languages of France, which can be studied but cannot be used in the government or any public service, where only French is official.

In some cases, a regional language may be the main or official language of another country; that is the case, in Europe, of French in the Valle d'Aosta, or Slovene in Austria.

Status changes may take place either by laws within a state or is by political and territorial changes.

An example of the first case is Belgium, where only French was the official language since the independence in 1831. In 1878, it was allowed that the provinces and districts where Flemish was spoken to use either French or Flemish; then, in 1938, Flemish became the official language of the northern part of Belgium.

For the second case, an example is the fragmentation of the Soviet Union where some regional languages, such as Latvian, Romanian or Georgian, became official languages in the new states formed after the fragmentation: Latvia, Moldova and Georgia.

Cuban Spanish

Cuban Spanish is a dialect of the Spanish language. It is the dialect spoken in Cuba. It shares many of the same features as other Caribbean dialects of Spanish.

Much of Cuban Spanish derives from the Spanish spoken in the Canary Islands of Spain. This is because large numbers of Canarian people moved to Cuba in the 19th and early 20th centuries. People from other Spanish communities, such as Galicians, Catalans, Basques and Asturians, also moved here, but did not have as much influence on the language as the Canarians did. Many words in Cuban Spanish come from the Canarian dialect, but some words are from other parts of Spain. There are also words that come from West African languages, French, or from the indigenous Taíno language.

The language is spoken differently from east to west. The eastern part of the island had large plantations where many African slaves worked during the 18th and 19th centuries. Therefore, the east has a stronger influence from African languages (such as Yoruba and Kikongo) than the west. It is closer to Dominican Spanish than to the Spanish spoken in the western part of the island. The Haitian Creole language influenced the eastern Cuban culture after the Haitian Revolution. Some words of the eastern dialect can be traced back to Haitian Creole words used every day locally. Some Cubans can still speak Haitian Creole.

James Douglas, Lord of Douglas

Sir James Douglas (also known as Good Sir James and James the Black Douglas), (died 1330), was a Scottish soldier, knight and leader during the Wars of Scottish Independence. He is considered one of Scotland's greatest heroes. He was a follower and close friend of king Robert I of Scotland (also called Robert the Bruce).

James Douglas was the oldest son of William, Lord of Douglas and Elizabeth Stewart. His father, William, had refused to support king Edward I of England who had taken over Scotland in 1290. The English king put William in prison and took his lands. This left young James with no land and no father. Douglas then went to France where he lived a simple life for three years. On hearing of his father's death he returned to Scotland and went to see William of Lamberton, Bishop of St. Andrews. The bishop took James in and in due time Bishop Lamberton took James to see King Edward I of England. When the bishop asked for the lands of Douglas to be returned to James, the king grew angry and said no. The lordship of Douglas had been given to Robert Clifford and the king would hear no more of the matter. Douglas remained in the service of the bishop and did nothing to rebel against the king of England. He hoped to get his family's lands returned to him. But in 1306 Robert the Bruce claimed the crown of Scotland as king Robert I. Now Douglas had a choice between two kings who might restore his lands.

In 1307 Douglas joined king Robert against the English king, Edward I That spring James Douglas with some of his men attacked his father's castle of Douglas and defeated the English soldiers there. Douglas then burned his castle and destroyed all stores of wine and grain. He poisoned the wells and executed the English soldiers they . This event became known as Douglas' larder. Even though Douglas did not yet possess his father's lands he had influence in that region. He and his men of Douglas harried the English forces in the region all that summer. The tactics used by Bruce and his followers including Douglas were limited to surprise attacks and quick escapes. They burned enemy lands and rendered castles they captured useless to the English. On learning the Earl of Pembroke was moving a large army into Scotland, Douglas went to warn Robert Bruce. Bruce and Douglas split up and agreed to meet at another place. When they rejoined their forces they attacked the English and defeated them.

In several raids in 1307 and 1308 James Douglas provided support to King Robert in the south of Scotland. On the night of Tuesday 19 February 1314 James Douglas and his men wearing black coats to cover their armor attacked Roxbrugh Castle. Roxbrugh was the main English stronghold in south central Scotland. It was defended by 100 English soldiers. The fall of Roxbrugh Castle caused many in the area to flee back to England. Now held by Douglas it was the beginning of his reputation as "the Black Douglas". To the people of Scotland he was "the Good Sir James". He was now one of the king's greatest supporter and a model of chivalry. But James had black hair and a reputation so feared by the English they named him "the Black Douglas." They said his evil success against them was because he was a demon himself. His son and grandson also used the feared name themselves continuing the family reputation.

Edward II of England had kept up the wars against the Bruce and his followers. He was growing more and more angry with each victory of Robert the Bruce and his followers. Determined to put an end to Bruce once and for all he assembled a very large army. It consisted of mounted knights, archers, crossbow-men, and foot soldiers led by Edward himself. the exact size of his army is unknown, but it was several times larger than that of Robert the Bruce. King Robert chose the place for the upcoming battle at Bannockburn very carefully He chose a position with several natural defenses many of which prevented heavy cavalry or large mass formations to operate. He formed his army into four 'battles' or Battalions, three of which consisted of 'hedgehog' or schiltrons Just before the battle began king Robert knighted Sir James Douglas, his cousin Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland, and many others. James and Walter were joint leaders of the left battalion.

When the English army was still approaching, king Robert sent Douglas and Sir Robert Keith, Marischal of Scotland to observe the English and report back to him. Douglas and Keith reported king Edward was approaching with a very large army. During the battle most of the fighting was directed at the other two battalions. When the center battalion led by Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray was in trouble, Douglas went to their rescue of his close friend. But the English retreated before Douglas could help. Finally the Scots won the battle and the English fell back in confusion, king Edward with 500 mounted knights fled the field. James Douglas with a small mounted force gave chase to the English king. They chased them all the way to Dunbar, but Edward escaped back to England.

After English defeat at Bannockburn the northern border of England was very lightly defended. In August of 1314 James Douglas, along with Edward Bruce (the king's brother), and John of Soules led a large raid into England. From 1314 to 1319 Douglas was raiding northern England at least once a year. When Edward Bruce left for Ireland in 1317 Douglas took his place as leader in the south of Scotland. These raids were not just to frighten the English but to get cash payment for king of Scotland for not attacking that village. It was also to prove to the English that their king Edward II could not protect them. Douglas was the one of the main leader in the wars on the English border until the final peace in 1328.

Two times, in 1319 and in 1322, when Douglas raided into Yorkshire he tried to capture King Edward II and his wife Queen Isabella of France. While he did not succeed this only added to his reputation by the English as "the Black Douglas." On 25 December 1319 the Scots and English signed a two year truce. In 1320, James Douglas put his seal on the Declaration of Arbroath. This declaration of Scottish independence was in the form of a letter to Pope John XXII.

During this period Douglas was rewarded many times with grants of lands. One grant was not of land but of privileges. Called the Emerald Charter, it gave James Douglas and his heirs freedom from many obligations to the king. It also made Douglas and his heirs a judge in their own lands. In giving James Douglas this special grant the king took an emerald ring from his finger and placed it on Douglas' finger. His importance to King Robert and to Scotland was increasing as time went on. 

In 1328 Robert the Bruce was in poor health and was dying. One thing he had not been able to do was to go on a crusade. He asked his friend Sir James Douglas to take his heart to the Holy Land. The king died on 7 June 1329. After the king's death James Douglas had a silver casket made and placed in it the heart of Robert the Bruce. He kept it safe on a chain around his neck. In 1330 he and six knights set out in a ship with royal banners. This is so all who saw it would know the heart of Robert, King of Scotland was on its way to Jerusalem in the Holy Land. The ship waited at Sluys, Flanders for other knights to join them before continuing on their voyage. They sailed to Spain where they stopped at Seville. They were welcomed by Alfonso XI, King of Castile and Leon as well as many English knights who had come to Spain to fight against the Moors. In August 1330 outside the walls of the Moorish town of Teba de Ardales Douglas and his knights joined the king's army. King Alfonso asked Douglas if he would lead the vanguard and placed all the English and Scottish knights under his command. Douglas ordered the charge and the fighting began right away. When the moors pretended to retreat, Douglas and ten of his knights chased after them. But it was a trick and the Moors turned and surrounded them. Trying to rescue a fellow knight Douglas and all his knights were killed. Sir James Douglas was found with the silver casket still around his neck. His body was made ready for the trip home. The silver casket containing the heart of Bruce never reached the Holy Land. It was buried at the Abbey of Melrose. Sir James Douglas was buried at the Kirk of Douglas.

List of dialling codes in the United Kingdom

This is a list of dialling codes for telephones in the United Kingdom. Dialling codes are the basis for the national telephone numbering plan. They are prefixed to all telephone numbers, generally depending on the type of number and its geographic location. The numbering plan is maintained by Ofcom, which is an independent communications authority. This list is based on the official standard, but it also shows older codes and historical changes. Dialling codes do not match any specific political boundaries. For example, the dialling code for Coventry covers a large area of Warwickshire and the Manchester dialling code covers part or all of several neighbouring towns. When dialling a number from within the United Kingdom, all area codes start with a 0. When dialling from outside the country, the prefix is not dialed.

"For an explanation of the two letter STD codes used below, see Introduction of area codes"

01426, 01523 and other non-standard 01 prefixes were briefly used for pagers in the late 1990s and then moved to new 076 prefixes in the Big Number Change in 2000/2001.

The 01632 area code is set aside for use as fictional numbers for drama as are parts of a number of other area codes.

The length of the area code part and the local number part is found as follows:
The number format '2+8' refers to, e.g. London, numbers using the (020) xxxx xxxx format.

The number format '5+4' refers to, e.g. Brampton, numbers using the (0169 77) xxxx format.

In the following area local calls must be dialled using the area code from the date shown.
Unlike the Crown Dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man which use the UK area codes 01534, 01481 and 01624 respectively, telephone numbers in British Overseas Territories do not come under the UK telephone numbering plan. Some are within the North American Numbering Plan (NANP). These calls are treated as international calls. Below are the access codes for the overseas territories:

Anosmia

Anosmia is losing the sense of smell. The word is also used for people who never had this sense. The loss can be temporary, or permanent. The conditions that cause a temporary loss of this sense include:

Smelling things depends on two nerves (Nervus olfactorius and Nervus trigeminus), as well as the part of the brain which processes the information. Damage to this system will affect the sense of smell; permanent damage may lead to a permanent loss of the sense of smell.

There are tests that can be done to find the cause of the problem.

The sense of smell also affects the sense of taste. People who cannot smell have only the basic tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami.

Note also that the sense of smell changes with age. Anosmia can also point to different neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease,
Alzheimer's disease, or Schizophrenia. Certain plants, such as tobacco also contain substances which change olfaction.

In general, anosmia which has its cause in the brain cannot be treated. Anosmia which is caused by blocking the nose can be treated by removing the block. In some cases, accupuncture was successfully used to treat anosmia.

Nasal congestion from a cold, allergy, sinus infection, or poor air quality is the most common cause of anosmia. Other anosmia causes include:


The Boston Post

The Boston Post was a newspaper published in Boston, Massachusetts between 1831 and 1956. It was one of the most popular daily newspaper in New England for over a hundred years. The "Post" was founded in November 1831 by two businessmen: Charles G. Greene and William Beals. By the 1930s, "The Boston Post" had grown to be one of the largest newspapers in the country, with well over a million readers.

During the 1940s, the newspaper faced more and more competition from papers published by William Hearst. More people began listening to the news on radio and television, and the paper's business began to suffer. It stopped being published in October 1956. At the time, it was printing about 255,000 copies of its daily issue, and about 260,000 of its Sunday edition.


In the Sunday paper every week was included a weekly magazine. It was originally called "The Sunday Magazine of "The Boston Sunday Post"" and later ""The Boston Sunday Post" Sunday Magazine".


The "Boston Post" Cane was an award given by many New England towns to their oldest citizen. It was originally done in 1909, when the newspaper was owned by Edwin A. Grozier. The newspaper had several hundred ornate, gold-tipped canes made, and then given presented in a ceremony to each town's oldest living man. The custom was expanded to include a community's oldest women in 1930. Many towns in New England still carry on the "Boston Post" cane tradition with the original canes they were awarded in 1909. When a recipient dies (or leaves the community), the cane passes to a successor who is the town's next oldest living resident.

Sniper team

A sniper team (or sniper cell) is made up of one or more snipers and support personnel such as a spotter. Members can sometimes fulfill several roles. The spotter helps to closely observe the targets and their surroundings. The sniper fires the shots. Sometimes there may be extra members in the team, including someone to secure and the team's position, and to communicate with other teams. This third member is known as the flanker.

The spotter finds, watches, and assigns targets, and also watches to see whether the shot has hit or missed the target. They use a specialised telescope to do this. They also make calculations for distance and angle, and try to read the direction and strength of the wind. This is so that the sniper can make adjustments to the aim to make the shot more accurate.

As well as their long-range rifle, a sniper team is usually armed with a shorter-ranged weapon. This is to defend the team in case enemies come in close contact. Equally important is remaining hidden from view. Teams use camouflage, and choose locations where there is something for them to hide behind.

Rock Me (One Direction song)

"Rock Me" is a song by One Direction from their second album "Take Me Home". The song was written by Peter Svensson, Sam Hollander, Lukasz Gottwald, Henry Walter, and Allan Grigg and was produced by Dr. Luke, Cirkut, and Kool Kojak. The song has a mid-tempo beat and a clapping riff reminiscent of "We Will Rock You" by Queen. The song received mixed reviews from critics, some of whom criticized its lyrics and others of whom praised its rock elements and production. "Rock Me" appeared on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. 

"Rock Me" was written in one day by guitar player Peter Svensson of the Swedish band the Cardigans, Sam Hollander, and Allan 'Kool Kojak' Grigg for One Direction's second album "Take Me Home", which was released in November 2012. Grigg began by making a mid-tempo beat. Svensson has said that Hollander "had an idea for a title that's like 'rock me' instead of ‘rock you,’ and the melody just came." Lukasz 'Dr. Luke' Gottwald and Henry 'Cirkut' Walter co-produced the song.

"Rock Me" is a mid-tempo pop rock song. Both "Billboard" and BBC Music said that the song was a departure from One Direction's signature bubblegum pop sound. One Direction's members’ voice ranges on the song span from F to C. The instrumentals feature guitar strings and piano lines. The song is in the key of Ab major, the time signature is common time, and the tempo is a moderate 84 beats per minute. 

Critics have also remarked that the song has beat and clapping riff similar to those in Queen's "We Will Rock You". The lyrics have a nostalgic message about a former significant other and a double entendre for sexual intercourse. Regarding the double entendre, Grigg noted, "but at the same time, there's a vulnerability in it that's, like, so sweet for girls. It's a little self-deprecating. There's not a lot of overt machismo in the song.” "I approached it like high school," said Hollander, who wrote lyrics for "Rock Me": "On the first record, they were freshmen, innocent and wide-eyed. Now it's sophomore year, there are parties and driver’s licenses, and the world is theirs for the taking. That's what I wanted to capture."

Alexis Petridis of "The Guardian" criticized the song as “excruciating” and called the lyrics tedious and uninspiring. "The New Zealand Herald" writer Lydia Jenkin deemed "Rock Me" one of "the most banal songs ever written," but noted that the group "know what teenage girls want to hear." Idolator critic Sam Lansky praised the track as "irresistible" and commended its sonic palette as "explosively punchy." Writing for HitFix, Melinda Newman favored its "nearly hypnotic anthemic" beat, and noted that "Rock Me" seemed perfectly tailored to become a live staple. Ben Rayner of the "Toronto Star" thought the song's Queen references were “clever” and “show[ed] that One Direction’s puppeteers aren't totally operating on autopilot." Robert Copsey from Digital Spy opined that the song's "simple-yet-genius catchiness" was its strongest attribute. "Billboard" reviewer Chris Payne applauded its rock elements, regarding it as a “welcome” deviation from the rest of "Take Me Home"'s bubblegum pop sound.

During the week of November 18, 2012, "Rock Me" debuted at number one on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart due to very high digital download sales. As a result of an "end-of-year download rush" in the week ending December 30, 2012, the track made it onto the US "Billboard" Hot 100 at number 98, which was its peak position on the chart.

Watson (computer)

Watson is an artificially intelligent computer system that can answer questions asked in a natural language. It was made by IBM to compete on the American television game show "Jeopardy!". In February 2011, Watson played as a contestant on "Jeopardy!" against past champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. Watson won the first place prize of $1 million. It was named after Thomas J. Watson, who was the chairman and chief executive officer of IBM from 1914 to 1956.

During a game, Watson had access to 200 million pages of content, including the full text of Wikipedia. Sources of information for Watson included encyclopedias, dictionaries, thesauri, news articles, and books. It was not connected to the internet, meaning that it had to use what was in its system to answer clues. For each clue, Watson's three most likely responses were displayed on the television screen along with its amount of confidence in those answers. If its confidence in a response was high enough, it would ring in to give the response.

After "Jeopardy!", Watson continued to be part of IBM's research in artificial intelligence. On new problems such as medical records and genetics, Watson technology was unable to compete with new methods such as deep learning.

Cractston's name is spelled “John Craxston Sr.” on the Tomb.

Waterloo International railway station

Waterloo International was the first London station for Eurostar trains to France and Belgium. It was treated as a separate station to the main station at London Waterloo, but its 5 platforms were numbered 20 to 24.

Dog coat

A dog's coat is the hair covering its body. A dog can have a "double coat" that has short, soft hair underneath a layer of long, coarse hair, or a "single coat" that has only the long, coarse hair. A dog's coat may also be called hair or fur.

Dog coats can come in many different colors, patterns, lengths, and textures.

Dog coats come in four main colors: black, brown, white, and red. The same main color can have many shades. These shades are sometimes common enough that they are given their own color names, such as gold, yellow, cream, blue, and grey.

There may be several of these colors on one dog.

Dog coats can also have many different patterns based on spots, patches, and mixing colors.

A dog's coat can be long or short. For most dogs, their hair reaches one length and then stops growing, but there are some dogs whose hair will keep growing longer and longer.

Some breeds of dog do not grow hair on parts of their bodies. These dogs are called "hairless". Examples of "hairless" dogs are the Xoloitzcuintli (Mexican Hairless Dog), the Peruvian Inca Orchid (Peruvian Hairless Dog) and the Chinese Crested.

Hakodate was bigger than Sapporo. In 1886, she got an English teaching job at the Public Teacher’s College of Sapporo. The next year, she could start a Christian school by herself. It was called Smith Girls' School ( "Sumisu Joshi Gakkou").

In the Meiji Era (1868–1912), Hokkaido was a new land in Japan. Also the land was big, so there were many farms. Most schools were farming schools. Smith Girls' School had some farming and Christian education. In 1890, Smith introduced lilacs to Sapporo from the United States. Now, lilac is the official tree of Sapporo and the city has a lilac festival every year in downtown Odori Park.

Angela Davis

Angela Yvonne Davis (born January 26, 1944 in Birmingham, Alabama) is an African American political activist and author. She first became famous because she was a prominent member of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) and was involved in Black Power movements in the 1960s and 1970s. Since then she has become known for her work as a writer and speaker while teaching at the University of California. She has done research in the areas of feminism and critical theory and is a prison abolitionist.

Davis grew up in Alabama, then went to college at Brandeis University and University of California, San Diego. She was involved in activism from her youth. After becoming a Doctor of Philosophy in Germany, she returned to the US and began teaching as a professor. In 1969, she was fired from teaching for being a member of the Communist Party. A judge decided it was an illegal firing and the school eventually hired her back.

In 1970 she was put in prison by FBI agents. Some black revolutionaries tried to break their allies out of prison by kidnapping a white judge and some jurors in Marin County, but the police didn't let them get away and the revolutionaries and judge were shot to death. The FBI suspected that she bought the gun one of the revolutionaries used and decided to accuse her of the murder of the judge. In 1971 she appeared at the Marin County Superior Court and said, "I now declare publicly before the court, before the people of this country that I am innocent of all charges which have been leveled against me by the state of California." She was released from jail in 1972. Ronald Reagan said that she should never be allowed to teach at a California university. The English rock band The Rolling Stones recorded a song called "Sweet Black Angel" that was on their 1972 album "Exile on Main St." and dedicated to Davis.

In the 1990s, she left the Communist Party and began to focus her activism on prisons. She gave a speech in 1997 called "The Prison Industrial Complex". In it she said "prisons are becoming an integral part of the US economy." She said that fear of young people of color was being exploited to create a fast-growing industry, the prison-industrial complex (PIC). She created a prison abolitionist group called Critical Resistance in the same year. She wants there to be no prisons or police because she believes that the US prison system is more like a new form of slavery than a criminal justice system.

Since she started focusing on prisons, she has also supported Democrats like Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Joe Biden in presidential elections.

Davis is Distinguished Professor Emerita at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

She was married to Hilton Braithwaite in the 1980s.

She was the daughter of the strip's main character, Henry Tremblechin. She constantly annoyed her father with pranks and practical jokes. The character of Iodine became very popular, so Hatlo promoted the character into her own strip in 1943.

Iodine's antics were on the Sunday comics page for over forty years. It came before "Dennis the Menace". From 1943 to 1963, "Little Iodine" was written and drawn by Hatlo.

A movie based on the comic strip was released in 1946. It was by Comet Productions. The 56-minute movie stars Jo Ann Marlowe as Little Iodine, Hobart Cavanaugh as her father Henry, and Irene Ryan as her mother Cora.
In the movie, Iodine thinks that her mother is having an affair with Professor Simkins (played by Leon Belasco). She tries one antic after another to break up the couple. Her efforts backfire when they cause conflict between her father and his employer, Mr. Bigdome (Emory Parnell).

The movie was planned to be released earlier than October 20, 1946 (its actual distribution date), but that date was delayed due to an epidemic of polio that prevented children across the United States from attending movies. The movie is believed to be lost.

Transistor radio

A Transistor radio is a radio receiver which uses transistors to amplify the sound. Transistor radios can be cheap and small and some use very little electric power. Some can amplify the weak radio waves that are usually not picked up by weaker vacuum tube radios. Transistor radio broadcasting receivers for portable use were sold in great numbers starting in the late 1950s. Soon, vacuum tube radios became rare. 

Cargo aircraft

A cargo aircraft is an aircraft that can carry cargo. In some cases, it may also carry passengers.

Civilian cargo aircraft carry cargo or mail. This is generally a kind of airliner, designed for passengers but modified for cargo. Some civilians cargo aircraft are specially equipped for carrying oversized cargo such as aircraft wings, tank-trucks, rocket pieces, or sometimes military heavy trucks and tanks.


Military transport aircraft can carry cargo and passengers. Passengers are usually troops, including paratroopers. The seats are usually simple. These aircraft typically have a sloping loading door at the rear of the fuselage for quick loading and unloading. Some use turbojets, others use turboprop engines.



Subwoofer

Subwoofer is a type of loudspeaker that is designed to produce low frequencies, example 20 - 200 Hz. Usually subwoofers are quite big and heavy.

Liquor stores, like grocery stores, are essential businesses, meaning that they remained open during the COVID-19 pandemic. The reason they are essential businesses is because people who have alcohol use disorder consume alcohol to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

Hoag's object

Hoag's object is a ring galaxy. The galaxy is named after Arthur Allen Hoag who discovered it in 1950. He identified it as either a planetary nebula or an unusual galaxy. The object has about eight billion stars, and is ~600 million light-years away in the constellation Serpens.

A nearly perfect ring of young hot blue stars circles the older yellow nucleus of this ring galaxy. The inner core of the galaxy is about (), while the surrounding ring has an inner 28″ diameter of () and an outer 45″ diameter of (), which is slightly larger than the Milky Way Galaxy. The gap separating the two stellar populations may contain some star clusters that are almost too faint to see.

As rare as this type of galaxy is, another more distant,reddish (and unnamed) ring galaxy can be seen through Hoag's object, between the nucleus and the outer ring of the galaxy, at roughly the one o'clock position in the picture to the right.

Art Hoag suggested the visible ring was a product of gravitational lensing. This idea was later discarded: the nucleus and the ring have the same redshift, and the ring shows knotty structure which would not be visible with gravitational lensing.

Many of the details of the galaxy remain a mystery, especially how it formed. "Classic" ring galaxies are usually formed by the collision of a small galaxy with a larger disk-shaped galaxy. This collision produces a density wave in the disk which leads to a characteristic ring-like appearance. Such an event, 2–3 billion years in the past, may have formed polar-ring galaxies. However, there is no sign of any second galaxy which would have acted as the "bullet", and the core of Hoag's object has a very low velocity relative to the ring, making the typical formation hypothesis unlikely.

Noah Brosch suggested that Hoag's object might be a product of an extreme "bar instability" which occurred a few billion years ago in a barred spiral galaxy. Schweizer "et al" claims that this is unlikely because the nucleus of the object is spheroidal, whereas the nucleus of a barred spiral galaxy is disc-shaped. However, evidence is somewhat thin for this dispute to be settled. A few other galaxies share the characteristics of Hoag's object, including the bright detached ring of stars, but their centers are elongated or barred, and they may exhibit some spiral structure While none match Hoag's object in symmetry, this handful of galaxies are known to some as Hoag-type galaxies.

Haredi Judaism

Haredi ( ') is the most conservative form of Orthodox Judaism and is known as Ultra-Orthodox Judaism

Haredi Judaism consists of many spiritual and cultural groups, and is divided into Hasidic sects with streams from Eastern Europe and Sephardic Haredim. The two are different in many aspects, including their beliefs, lifestyles, religious practice and philosophy, and isolation from the general culture where they live.

Most Haredi Jews currently live in Israel, North America and Western Europe. Their population is growing very fast due to a high birth rate. It doubles every 12 to 20 years.

The Me'a She'arim neighbourhood in Jerusalem is mainly populated by Haredi Jews.

Jews as the chosen people

The Jewish belief of Jews as a chosen people is that Jews are the chosen people of God. Some Jews believe that God has given them a special job to repair the world and make it a better place. According to this view, they must use the things in the world to increase good and come closer to God, and as God’s partner in repairing the world – to find ways to lessen suffering of people and animals, to make more peace and respect between people, and to protect the earth’s environment from destruction. This process is known as “"tikkun olam"” (from Hebrew) – repairing the world. 

This origin of the idea in the Torah (the first five books of the Tanakh, which are also included in the Christian Bible). Much is written about these topics in rabbinic literature:

According to Judaism, God made an agreement called a “covenant” with Abraham, the ancestor of the Jewish people. The Bible says that God promised to bless Abraham and his descendants if they worshipped God and were faithful to him. God made this covenant with Abraham's son, Isaac, and with Isaac's son, Jacob. God also gave Jacob another name – Israel. This is how Jacob’s descendants got the name the “Children of Israel” or “Israelites.” The Jewish religion, God later gave the Israelites the Torah to the Israelites through their leader, Moses. The Torah told the Israelites how to live and build their community. God gave the Israelites the Ten Commandments and other laws in the Torah.

The Jews are sometimes called the “Chosen People" because the Bible says God told them “you will be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation” (Exodus 19:6) and “For you are a holy people to the Lord your God, and the Lord chose you to be His own special nation out of all peoples on the earth” (Deuteronomy 14:2). Religious Jews ("orthodox") understand this means that they have special duties and responsibilities commanded by God - for example, that they must build a just society and serve only God. They believe that this covenant works in two ways: if they follow God’s laws, He will give them his love and protection, but they are also responsible for their sins – bad actions – and not doing what God told them. Religious Jews believe that they must teach other people that God exists and that God wants all people to do good actions. Jews believe that their job in the world is to be "a light to the nations" (Isiah 49:6) by showing the people of the world ways to make the world a better place.

The idea of chosenness has traditionally been interpreted by Jews in two ways: one way is that God chose the Israelites, while the other is that the Israelites chose God. Another opinion is that even though the Jews chose to follow God, the Kabbalah and Tanya teach that even prior to creation, the "Jewish soul" was already chosen. However, Jews do not believe that being a member of the Chosen People gives them any special talents or makes them better than anyone else, and many of whose who are considered "Jewish" (especially secular/(non-religious ones) do not believe they are "Chosen" in any way at all. 

Jews generally do not try to convince other people to believe in Judaism. Jews believe they have a special job to show all peoples that God exists, but people do not have to be Jewish to follow God. All people can serve God by following the Seven Commandments (rules) given to Noah. But, Judaism accepts people who choose to change their religion to Judaism. 

The Jewish people have a special status in the Islamic book, the Quran:
O children of Israel, remember my favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I favored you above all creation. (Qur'an 2:47). 2:122).

Many Christians also believe that the Jews were God's chosen people (), but because of Jewish rejection of Jesus, the Christians in turn received that special status (). This doctrine is known as Supersessionism.

Ketuvim

Ketuvim (in Biblical Hebrew: "writings") is the third and final section of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), after Torah (instruction) and Nevi'im (prophets). It includes: 













Crest (feathers)

The crest, in some cases called a crown, of a bird, is a group of feathers that some species of birds have on top of the head. The feathers of these crests can move up and down or be permanently up, depending of the species. For example, the crests of cockatoos and the hoopoe could be up or down but the feathers in the crest of the grey crowned crane are always up.

Crests on birds are generally used for display purposes. Birds with crests often use them to communicate with others and as a part of their courtship. They also tend to display their crests when they are frightened or ready to fight because the birds may appear larger than they really are.

Cockatoos and their smaller cousins, cockatiels, are part of the Cacatuidae family of parrots found in Australia, the Bismarck Archipelago and the Philippines, and are probably the most recognizable birds to feature crests. Cockatoos and cockatiels possess crests which may be raised or lowered at will. Their crests are used to communicate with fellow members of their species, or as a form of defense to frighten away other species that approach too closely, making the bird appear larger when the crest is suddenly and unexpectedly raised.


Chumash (Judaism)

The Hebrew term Chumash (also Ḥumash, ) is a term for "Torah" in printed form, unlike the Torah scroll.

Theory of the Earth

Theory of the Earth was a publication by James Hutton which laid the foundations for geology. In it he showed that the Earth is the product of natural forces. What could be seen happening today, over long periods of time, could produce what we see in the rocks. This idea, uniformitarianism, was a major step in the History of the geologic time scale. It was used by Charles Lyell in his work, and Lyell's textbook was an important influence on Charles Darwin.

Hutton recognized that rocks record the evidence of the past action of processes which still operate today. He also anticipated natural selection, as follows:

Hutton's prose hindered his theories. John Playfair in 1802 restated of Huttton's geological ideas in clearer English. However, he left out Hutton's thoughts on evolution. Charles Lyell in the 1830s popularised the idea of an infinitely repeating cycle (of the erosion of rocks and the building up of sediment). Lyell believed in gradual change, and thought even Hutton gave too much credit to catastrophic changes.

Hutton's work was published in different forms and stages:

Kill Your Darlings

The movie Kill Your Darlings is a 2013 historic drama set in 1944. The cast includes Daniel Radcliffe as Allen Ginsberg, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Naomi and Kyra Sedgwick as Marian Carr. This movie got very positive reviews from the critics.

Accusative case

The accusative case is the grammatical case which marks the direct object of a transitive verb. This is best explained with examples:

In the sentence ""He" sees the woman", "he" is the subject of the sentence. In the sentence "The woman sees "him"", "him" is the object. 

So, in English we use different forms of the pronoun: he/him. "Him" would be the accusative case. If we use a noun, there is no difference in English. We use the same word "man": The man sees the woman" and "The woman sees the man. 

In many languages different forms of the word are used, depending on what function it has in the sentence - subject or object. 

For example, in Latin. "The man sees the woman" = "Vir feminam videt", while "The woman sees the man" = "Femina virum videt". For "man", Latin uses "vir" for the subject, and "virum" for the object. Also, in the same sentences, we have "femina" for a subject and "feminam" for object. The form used for the direct object ("him", "virum", "feminam") is known as the "accusative case", while the form used for the subject ("he", "vir", "femina") is known as the nominative case.

In some languages, like German, the accusative case is applied to the definite article and not to the noun. In German, "the car" as the subject of a sentence may be "der Wagen". This is the form in the nominative case. When "the car" is used as the object in a sentence, it becomes "den Wagen", the accusative.

Cavan is known as 'The Lakeland County' and it is said it has 365 lakes, one for every day of the year. At , Lough Sheelin is the county's largest lake in the south of the county. A large area of lakes in the north and west of Cavan are marked as Specially Protected Areas (SPA), example of this being Lough Oughter. Other important wildlife protected lakes such as Lough Gowna and Lough Ramor are in the south and east of the county. The county contains forests such as Bellamont Forest near Cootehill, Killykeen Forest Park at Lough Oughter (a Coillte state forest), Dún na Rí Forest Park and the Burren Forest.

Many rivers in Ireland start in County Cavan. The Shannon Pot is the source of the River Shannon, the longest river in Ireland at . The River Erne is a major river which starts from Beaghy Lough south of Stradone in Cavan and flows for to Lough Erne.

In medieval times, the area of Cavan was part of East Bréifne after its ruling Gaelic family. This in was a division of the 11th century Kingdom of Bréifne. For this reason the county is also sometimes known as the Breffni County. The natural landscape of drumlin hills and loughs made a good defence against invaders.

Historically, Cavan was part of the western province of Connacht, but was transferred to Ulster in 1584 when Bréifne was shired and became the county of Cavan. In the south, the Lough Sheelin area was part of Leinster until the late 14th century.

Parts of Cavan were under Norman influence from the twelfth century. The remains of several buildings from the time can still be seen at Castlerahan and Clogh Oughter castle. There are also some remains of early abbeys in the county, like at Drumlane and Trinity Island.

The Plantation of Ulster from 1610 saw the settlement and origins of several new towns within the county like Bailieborough, Cootehill, Killeshandra and Virginia. Existing towns such as Cavan and Belturbet became over time more important as trading centres. Wars aimed at trying to unsettle the Plantation only led to further plantations of English and Scottish settlers into the county and the beginnings of a thriving flax and linen industry.

Agriculture is the largest industry in the county, especially dairy milk processing as well as pig and beef farming. Much of Cavan's land is clay soils, which are rich in minerals, but heavy and poorly drained, making pasture farming the dominant farming system in the county. The total farmed area is in the county, and there are approximately 219,568 cattle in Cavan.

Peat cutting exists in the northwest of the county, in the Cuilcagh range.

Cavan has expanded in other industries, mainly quarrying, energy production and manufacturing facilities.

The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection

The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection is a book by R.A. Fisher first published in 1930 by Oxford University Press which combines Mendelian genetics with Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. It is one of the most important books of the modern evolutionary synthesis.

A second, slightly revised edition was published in 1958. In 1999, a third variorum edition, with the original 1930 text, annotated with the 1958 alterations, notes and alterations accidentally omitted from the second edition was published.

When Fisher started his career, genetics was not a well-understood science. There were biologists who did not see how evolution by natural selection could happen with heredity as they understood it. The main effect of the book was to show the small changes in genes could indeed lead to the large changes seen in the fossil record. Fisher's second chapter, the "Fundamental theory of natural selection", convinced most biologists that Darwin's idea and modern genetics were compatible (could work together). Fisher's view was reinforced by Julian Huxley, J.B.S. Haldane, Sewell Wright, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and G. Ledyard Stebbins. All of these men were in touch with genetics. With the addition of two field biologists, Ernst Mayr and Bernhard Rensch and a palaeontologist, George Simpson, the group put together the modern synthesis.

Fisher also developed ideas on sexual selection, mimicry and the evolution of dominance. He showed that mutations with big effects usually reduce the fitness of the individual. He also proved that larger populations carry more variation and have a greater chance of survival. He set the foundations for population genetics.

About a third of the book concerned the applications of genetics to humans. Using the British census data of 1911, he showed there was an inverse relationship between fertility and social class. This was partly due, he believed, to the rise in social status of families who were not capable of producing many children but who rose because of the financial advantage of having a small number of children. Therefore he suggested subsidies (he called them allowances) to families with larger numbers of children, with the allowances proportional to the earnings of the father. He himself had two sons and six daughters.

The book was reviewed, among others, by physicist Charles Galton Darwin, a grandson of Charles Darwin's. After his review, C.G. Darwin sent Fisher his copy of the book, with notes in the margin. The marginal notes became the food for a correspondence running at least three years.

Although Fisher's book was immediately understood by the few who understood genetics, it was a long time before the general biologist appreciated it. It is now agreed to be one of the foundations of modern population genetics and evolution.

Fisher's book also had a major influence on W.D. Hamilton and the development of his theories on the genetic basis for kin selection. Hamilton, a leading theoretician of the later 20th century, said:

Aseptic meningitis

Meningitis happens when the brain's lining becomes inflamed. This lining is called the meninges. Aseptic meningitis occurs when there are signs of meningitis. However, when a sample of brain fluid is taken, bacteria do not grow. This condition is often treatable. In many cases, recovery takes 7–10 days.


These factors increase the chance of developing aseptic meningitis:

County Meath

County Meath () is a county in Ireland. It is part of the province of Leinster. It is named after the ancient "Kingdom of Mide" (in Gaelic "Mide" means "middle"). 184,135 people lived in the county according to the 2011 census. The county town is Navan, this is where the county hall and government are located. Trim used to be the county town. 

The River Boyne flows through the county.


The county is sometimes known by the nickname "The Royal County" because of its history as the seat of the High King of Ireland. 

County Meath formed the eastern part of the former Kingdom of Mide. The seat of the High King of Ireland was at Tara which is not far from Navan. 

The archaeological complex of "Brú na Bóinne" is 5,000 years old. It includes the burial sites of Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth, in the north-east of the county. It is a UNESCO designated World Heritage Site.

The county has a lot of farms, mainly cattle, dairying, potatoes and grain. Meath is Ireland's leading county producer of potatoes, and a significant producer of beef, barley, milk, wheat, and root vegetables. Europe's largest underground lead-zinc mine, Tara Mines, has operated since 1977, at a location to the west of Navan. 



Eddington limit

The Eddington limit, or Eddington luminosity was first worked out by Arthur Eddington. It is a natural limit to the normal luminosity of stars. The state of balance is a hydrostatic equilibrium. When a star exceeds the Eddington limit, it loses mass with a very intense radiation-driven stellar wind from its outer layers.

Eddington's models treated a star as a sphere of gas held up against gravity by internal thermal pressure. Eddington showed that radiation pressure was necessary to prevent collapse of the sphere.

Most massive stars have luminosities far below the Eddington luminosity, so their winds are mostly driven by the less intense line absorption. The Eddington limit explains the observed luminosity of accreting black holes such as quasars.

Eddington limit explains the very high mass loss rates seen in the outbursts of η Carinae in 1840–1860. The regular stellar winds can only stand for a mass loss rate of about 10–10 solar masses per year. Mass loss rates of up to 0.5 solar masses per year are needed to understand the η Carinae outbursts. This can be done with the help of the super-Eddington broad spectrum radiation driven winds.

Gamma-ray bursts, novae and supernovae are examples of systems exceeding their Eddington luminosity by a large factor for very short times, resulting in short and highly intensive mass loss rates. Some X-ray binaries and active galaxies are able to maintain luminosities close to the Eddington limit for very long times. For accretion powered sources such as accreting neutron stars or cataclysmic variables (accreting white dwarfs), the limit may act to reduce or cut off the accretion flow. Super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass black holes is one possible model for ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs).

For accreting black holes, all the energy released by accretion does not have to appear as outgoing luminosity, since energy can be lost through the event horizon, down the hole. Effectively, such sources may not conserve energy.

Maria Schneider (actress)

Maria Schneider (born Marie Christine Gélin, Paris, 27 March 1952 - 3 February 2011) was a French actress. She was in many movies. She played Jeanne in the 1972 erotic movie "Last Tango in Paris" opposite Marlon Brando. Schneider died in Paris from cancer at age fifty-eight.

Oregon spotted frog

The Oregon spotted frog ("Rana pretiosa") is a medium-sized water frog. The name "Rana pretiosa" means "precious frog". It comes from the Pacific Northwest area of North America. It can be found in the Puget Trough/Willamette Valley province and the Cascade Mountains of south-central Washington and Oregon. It is a rare frog and is listed by the IUCN as a vulnerable species.

Spiritualism

Spiritualism is a belief that humans can communicate with the spirits of the dead. It was popular in the nineteenth century up to the 1930s. The main centres were in America and Europe, with the Caribbean and South America, where it is usually called Spiritism.

Spiritualism did not have a book with authority, but it had pamphlets, meetings and mediums. A medium is a person, often female, who acts as a go-between between the living and the dead. 

At its peak, spiritualism was very popular, and its followers formed Spiritualist churches.

Debra Jo Rupp

Debra Jo Rupp (born 24 February 1951) is an American actress. She appears in television and movies. She played Kitty Forman in "That '70s Show". She played Alice in "Friends". Debra was born in Glendale, California. She was raised in Massachusetts.

Rita Rudner

Rita Rudner (born September 17, 1953) is an American actress and comedian. She appeared in August 2012 as Melissa's Mom in "Melissa & Joey". Rita Rudner was born in Miami, Florida.

Wrestling Brewster

Wrestling Brewster (ca. 1614 - ?) was a passenger on the ship "Mayflower" in 1620 when it sailed from England to North America. He was born in Leiden, The Netherlands about 1614 to William and Mary Brewster. He was alive during the 1627 Division of Cattle at Plymouth, and was listed in his father's household at that time. He is not mentioned again in any record, or in his father's will of 1644, or in the inventory of his father's estate. He did not marry. It is probable that he died some time between 1627 and 1644.

Correction, according to

Vasodilation

Vasodilation is where blood vessels widen. It results from relaxation of muscle cells within blood vessel walls. The process is essentially the opposite of vasoconstriction, which is the narrowing of blood vessels. 

When vessels widen, blood flow is increased. This in turn decreases blood pressure. Drugs that cause vasodilation are called vasodilators.

Love Brewster

Love Brewster was a passenger on the "Mayflower" in 1620. He was born about 1611 in Holland to William and Mary Brewster. 

He married Sarah Collier at Plymouth, Plymouth Colony in 1634, and sired four children upon her. He was active in the community, and died at Duxbury, north of Plymouth, about 1651.
Love was born in Leiden, The Netherlands about 1611 to Mary and William Brewster. On 15 May 1634, he married Sarah Collier at Plymouth. They had four children: Sarah, Nathaniel, William, and Wrestling.

Brewster became a freeman (able to vote and hold land) in Plymouth Colony on 2 March 1636. He volunteered to fight in the Pequot War (1634-1638), but saw no action because Plymouth's volunteers were not needed.

In 1642, Thomas Granger, Brewster's 16-year old servant, was caught committing bestiality upon Brewster's livestock. He admitted his transgression, and was executed with the animals, as the Bible commanded in Leviticus 20:15.

Brewster and his family moved to Duxbury, Plymouth Colony, north of the settlement at Plymouth. He served in the militia under Myles Standish. Brewster died at Duxbury between 6 October 1650 (when his will was written) and 31 January 1651 (when the will was probated).

Ocean County, New Jersey

Ocean County is a county in New Jersey that contains most of the Jersey Shore. The county seat is Toms River. The population is 637,229 as of 2020.

Oliver Hill

Oliver White Hill, Sr. (May 1, 1907 – August 5, 2007) was an American civil rights lawyer from Richmond, Virginia. His work against discrimination helped end "separate but equal". This was a reason used to support segregation in the United States. He also helped win important legal decisions, such as equality in pay for black teachers, access to school buses, voting rights, jury selection, and employment protection. He retired in 1998 after practicing law for almost 60 years. Along with his other awards, he earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom. This was given to him by President Bill Clinton in 1999. During the 1940s and 1950s, Hill was unsafe because of what he did. Because people called to threaten Hill, Hill's young son was not allowed to answer the telephone. A cross was burned on the Hill family's lawn. Still, Hill continued to work for civil rights. Hill died at the age of 100 in 2007 in Richmond, Virginia. 

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (which is also known as "B-cell" and "T-cell lymphomas") is a cancer of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. It is also part of the immune system. Clear fluid called "lymph" flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as "lymphocytes".

In lymphoma, these lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way. A lot of them appear in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties making you more vulnerable to infection.

The most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.

The usual way to know that a person has non-Hodgkin lymphoma is to do a biopsy (testing a sample of affected lymph node tissue).

Mary Brewster

Mary Brewster (ca. 1569 - 17 April 1627) was a passenger on the "Mayflower" in 1620 when the ship sailed from England to the New World. She was probably born in England, but her exact birthdate, birthplace, and birth surname are not known with certainty. She married William Brewster about 1592, and bore him six children. 

She lived in The Netherlands several years before emigrating to North America with her family. She survived her first harsh winter of 1620 in the New World, and was one of the four women still alive in 1621 to observe the first Thanksgiving. She died in Plymouth Colony in 1627. 

Mary was born in England about 1569, probably in Doncaster, Yorkshire or Scrooby, Nottinghamshire. Her maiden name is not known with certainty. Wentworth, Wyrall, Stubbe, Love and others have all been proposed, but none have been proven to be her surname.

She married William Brewster about 1592. It is not known if she was Brewster's first or second wife. She bore him six children: Jonathan, Patience, Fear, an unnamed child who died young, Love, and Wrestling.

Mary's husband was the leader of a Separatist congregation near Scrooby. The law required Englishmen to attend the Church of England, but these people secretly met in the Brewster home to worship in their own way. 

The authorities persecuted them for their unconventional religious beliefs and for flouting the law. In 1608, Mary Brewster and her family went to Leiden, The Netherlands to escape the persecution and to practice their religion in peace.

Unhappy with life in Leiden, the Brewster family decided to emigrate to North America. Mary sailed on the "Mayflower" in 1620 with her husband and her two youngest children, Love and Wrestling. Son Jonathan arrived in Plymouth in November 1621, and daughters Patience and Fear in 1623.

Mary Brewster was one of only five women to survive the first winter in the New World, and one of only four women who were still alive for the first Thanksgiving in 1621. She died on 17 April 1627 at Plymouth. Her resting place has not been found.

Dorothy Eaton

Dorothy Eaton (? - probably no later than 1624) was a passenger on the "Mayflower" in 1620. She was John Carver's maidservant. Her maiden name is unknown. William Bradford wrote of Carver's maidservant, "[she] married, and died a year or two after here in this place." She may have been Francis Eaton's second wife. A 1626 apprenticeship record from Bristol, England, mentions Francis Eaton, carpenter in New England, and his wife Dorothy.

Dorothy

Dorothy is a female given name. It comes from the Greek Δωροθέα ("Dōrothéa") meaning "God's Gift", from δῶρον ("dōron"), "gift" + θεός ("theós"), "god". There are also male names in English such as "Dorie" from the Greek word "Δωρόθεος" ("Dōrótheos"). Also, the given names Theodore and Theodora come from the same two Greek words as Dorothy, but in the reverse order.

Dorothy became one of the most popular girl's names in the United States between 1904 and 1940. It was ranked among the top 10 most popular names given to American newborn girls. The name was in the top 100 most popular names for American girls until 1961. In 2006 it was ranked 986 in the top 1,000 most popular names for American newborn girls. There were 235 newborn American girls given the name in 2010. 

In fiction:

Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden

Gustav II Adolf (19 December 1594 – 16 November 1632) was the King of Sweden from 1611 to 1632. He is known in English as Gustavus Adolphus.

He is often said to have made Sweden a great power. (). He is also said to be one of the best military leaders of all time. Gustav led Sweden to be a military power during the Thirty Years' War and spent most of his reign fighting.

Gustavus Adolphus was born in Stockholm. His parents were Charles IX of Sweden and his second wife, Christina of Holstein-Gottorp. When his father died in October 1611, while Gustavus was only 16 years old, he became King of Sweden.

Gustavus married Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg, daughter of John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg. Their daughter Christina later became Queen of Sweden.

In June 1630 he landed in Germany, starting the Swedish fight in the Thirty Year's War on the Anti-Imperial Protestant side, which was losing at the time. With Sweden's help the situation flipped so that the Protestants were winning.

Gustavus died in the Battle of Lützen in 1632 while leading a cavalry attack.

Gustavus Adolphus Day is on 6 November. Every year it is celebrated in Sweden, Estonia and Finland. On this day only, a special pastry is sold that has a chocolate or marzipan medallion of the king.

Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions

The Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions is a yearly tournament on the American television game show "Jeopardy!". It features 15 players who have won the most games from the past season. It started in 1964 when Art Fleming was host of the show; it is also played on the show with Alex Trebek as host until 2019, with Buzzy Cohen guest hosting the 2021 Tournament of Champions. Ken Jennings is now the host of the tournament starting with the 2022 Tournament of Champions. Winners of the College Championship (since 1989) and the Teachers Tournament (since 2011) also play in the Tournament of Champions.

"Jeopardy!"'s Tournament of Champions takes two weeks. The first five games are the quarterfinals, with three new contestants each day. The winners of the five games move on to the semi-finals. The four players with the highest scores who did not win their quarterfinal game also move on as "wild card" players. If there is a tie at the end of a game, one final answer is given, and the first player to ring in with the correct response wins the game. If all three players have a score of zero, none of the players move on to the semi-finals, and another wild card spot is added. The next three games are the semi-final games. The three winners of the semi-finals move on to the finals, which happens over two games and two days. Unlike the quarterfinals, if all three players have a score of zero, one final answer is given, with the first player to ring in with the correct question wins the game. This rule change was first implemented in 2013 to avoid a repeat of the November 2012 taping of the Teen Tournament which made it unfair for contestants who played in the semifinal before the zero loss. In each finals game, the players start with zero scores; after the second finals game, each player's score is added to their score from the first game, with the highest score being the winner, or "Grand Champion." The other two players win smaller cash prizes or their two-day total, whichever is higher.

In 2022 (Season 38) the tournament took a new format which expanded the field to 21 contestants. The top three seeded contestants will qualify for the semifinal rounds; the remaining 18 contestants will play six quarterfinal games, with no wild-card spots given. The six winners will advance to the semifinals and join the top three seeds. The winners of the semifinal matches will advance to the finals, which will consist of a minimum of three and a maximum of seven games, similar to the "Greatest of All Time" tournament (see below). The first finalist to win three games will win the tournament and the $250,000 top prize. The second-place and third-place prizes will be determined first by number of wins, then by number of second-place finishes, and finally by total score across all games played, and will win $100,000 and $50,000, respectively. 

From time to time, special Tournaments of Champions have been played. In 2002, the show held a Million Dollar Masters tournament. This was a two-week tournament where the winner won $1,000,000. It was taped at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. In 2005, the show held an Ultimate Tournament of Champions. It was a 15-week tournament with 145 players. The two players who made it to the finals would play against Ken Jennings for $2,000,000. In 2014, the show held a Battle of the Decades to commemorate the show's 30th anniversary. It was a 5-week tournament featuring 45 players; the field of contestants was broken up into three decades. The first three weeks featured players from their respective decades. Five winners from each decade advanced to the quarterfinals to compete for a $1,000,000 grand prize.

The following is a list of contestants and where they placed in the tournament. Prize amounts for the non-winning finalists who won more than the minimum guarantees are as indicated in parentheses.

Jeopardy! Teen Tournament

The Jeopardy! Teen Tournament is a yearly tournament on the American television game show "Jeopardy!" It features middle school and high school students between the ages of thirteen and eighteen.

The tournament plays like the Tournament of Champions. 15 contestants play in a two week tournament. The first five games are the quarterfinals, with three new contestants each day. The winners of the five games move on to the semi-finals. The four losing contestants with the highest scores also move on as "wild card" players. If there is a tie at the end of a game, a Final Jeopardy!-type answer is given, and the first player to ring in with the correct response wins the game. If all three players have a score of zero, none of the contestants move on to the semi-finals, and another wild card spot is added. The next three games are the semi-final games. The three winners of the semi-finals move on to the finals. The last two games are the two-day finals. In both games, the contestants start with zero scores, and the contestants' final scores from the two days are added together to see who is the winner. The contestant with the highest score from the two days wins. The other two contestants win smaller cash prizes.

Would-be contestants mailed postcards with their names and addresses to "Jeopardy!". 1,200 teens were selected at random from the postcard entries and were invited to come (at their own expense) to one of four regional test centers ("e.g." Houston, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles) to take a timed written qualifying examination with the 50 clues read by Alex Trebek on a video monitor at the front of an exam room. Passing scorers were invited back for an interview and mock game using an electronic buzzer system. Their photographs are taken for their files, and they are asked to fill out a short information sheet with interesting facts about themselves that may be later used by Alex Trebek during the interview portion of the show. Selected contestants and alternates were notified that they had been chosen to appear on the show one to two months later. They are then flown to Los Angeles to tape the show. Taping occurs over a period of two days, with the five quarterfinals played on the first day and the three semifinals and two final games played on the second day. Accommodations were provided for the contestants at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, with taping taking place at the Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California.

Contestants registered on the "Jeopardy!" web site rather than submitting postcards. As before, a select number of registrants were invited to audition and take a written test at a regional audition. Accommodations for contestants are provided at the Hilton in Universal City, California.

All web site registrants take a 50-question timed online test at one set test time, usually late February. The test is given using Adobe Flash and takers are given 15 seconds per clue to type in their responses. A random selection of those who pass the test are invited to attend regional auditions in November at 4 locations around the United States at which another 50-question written test is given, followed by interviews and mock games. The number of students selected for the regional auditions is usually around 300, from which 15 are selected for the show.


The following is a list of contestants and where they placed in the tournament. Winners and runners-up who earned more than the minimum guarantees are as indicated in parentheses.

A console game based upon the Teen Tournament was released in the mid 1990s for the Nintendo Game Boy.

The "Jeopardy!" Teen Reunion Tournament was a special one-week tournament held in November 1998 at the Boch Center in Boston, Massachusetts that invited back 12 former Teen Tournament contestants from the first three tournaments on "Jeopardy!"

Twelve former Teen Tournament contestants competed three at a time in four qualifying round matches. Winning contestants who were among the top three scorers would play in the final match for $50,000. Losing qualifiers took home $5,000, while the non-playing finalist took home $7,500. The third-place finisher took home a minimum guarantee of $10,000, while the second-place finisher was entitled to a minimum guarantee of $15,000. The highest scoring player in the finals took home $50,000.

The two nonwinning finalists also received the board game "Game of the Year" by University Games as well as a Tigris Pyramid and Movana.

Capozzola, Javerbaum, and Newhouse advanced to the finals.


Jeopardy! College Championship

The Jeopardy! College Championship is a yearly tournament on the American television game show "Jeopardy!" It features full-time undergraduate college students who have not yet gotten a degree.

The Jeopardy! College Championship is one of the traditional tournaments held each season on the TV quiz show Jeopardy! Contestants in this tournament are full-time undergraduate college students with no prior degrees and traditionally wear a sweater bearing the name of their college or university during their appearances. The existence of this tournament does not disqualify college students from auditioning for the regular shows, but tournament participants cannot later compete in regular play. The tournament began during the 1988-89 season (Season 5) and has been played every season (except for seasons 31, 35, and 37), always during any one of the three traditional sweeps ratings periods (November, February, or May) with the exception of being held in April 2018 due to Alex Trebek's brain surgery and April 2020 due to The Greatest of All Time Tournament. Some contestants for the inaugural tournament were selected through contestant searches held in Daytona Beach, Florida, and Palm Springs, California, during the Spring break season in 1989.

The College Championship uses a ten-game format similar to that used for the Tournament of Champions and the Teen Tournament: 15 players, in groups of three, play in five quarterfinal games; the winners of those five games and the four highest-scoring nonwinners as wild cards become the nine semifinalists who compete in three games, with no two players rematching each other in the semifinal round. The three semifinal winners advance to the two-day final round, in which contestants play two separate matches, with the contestants' combined scores for both matches determining the champion (contestants start with $0 each day).

All College Championship contestants receive cash prizes, based on their progress through the tournament. Contestants eliminated prior to the finals receive fixed payouts, while contestants in the finals receive guaranteed minimums, but can earn more. Over time, the prizes have increased in value, as shown below:

Winners also receive a small replica trophy of the larger College Championship trophy, which is retained by "Jeopardy!" in Southern California. On the larger trophy are engraved the names of every year's winner.

From 1993–2004, the winner also won a new car (Dodge from 1993–1994, Volvo from 1995–2003, and Volkswagen in 2004), and the company who manufactured the car matched each finalists' totals and set up scholarships in those amounts earned for the finalists' schools.


In addition to the above-mentioned winnings, the winner earns an automatic position in the next Tournament of Champions, though two winners (Vinita Kailasanath in 2001 and Joey Beachum in 2008) deferred their berths in their intended tournament until the following installments due to scheduling conflicts. Three College Champions have made the Tournament of Champions finals (Tom Cubbage in 1989, Jeff Stewart in 1994, and Cliff Galiher in 2007), but only Cubbage won the event.

Many college champions have been invited to later Jeopardy! "all-time best" tournaments as well, with varying degrees of success:

The following is a list of contestants and where they placed in the tournament. Finalists who earned more than the minimum guarantee are as indicated. 

Stanford University is the only college to have two winners.

The only College Champions from Ivy League schools are Terry O'Shea of Princeton University in 2014 and Dhruv Gaur of Brown University in 2018.


Julius and Ethel Rosenberg

Ethel Greenglass Rosenberg (September 25, 1915June 19, 1953) and Julius Rosenberg (May 12, 1918June 19, 1953) were Americans accused of being spies for the Soviet Union. They were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage during a time of war. They were both executed. Their crime was related to giving information about the atomic bomb to the Soviet Union. At that time and even later, many people in many countries thought they were innocent and had tried to convince the U.S. authorities not to kill them. After the fall of the Soviet Union, evidence came out that showed that Julius Rosenberg had been a spy but that his wife had not.

Its purpose was to surprise the enemy with attacks against military and civilian commands and control centers in South Vietnam.

Eventually, the Americans and the South Vietnamese managed to fight off the communist forces for a military victory. However, the massive fighting during the Tet Offensive made most Americans go from supporting the fighting in Vietnam to opposing it. The military and the government had told the Americans that the their country was close to winning. After that was disproved by the offensive, the US was said to have won the battle but to have lost the war.

Digital Audio Tape

Digital Audio Tape is a magnetic tape that permits to record audio. The recording is digital, its quality is similar to that of a compact disc. It was developed in the 1980s to replace the compact casette. Like tapes used for recording video, the tape can only be played in one direction, the "cassette" only has one side. It competed with Digital Compact Cassette (DCC), and the Minidisc. Unlike these however, it allows for an exact digital copy of the source; DCC and Minidisc use lossy data compression.

DAT tapes were also used to back up computer data in the 1990s and early 2000s. Most computer DAT drives will not read audio DAT tapes.

Sex segregation

Sex segregation is a highly controversial culture-related definition for separation of people according to their sex. This can occur in both public and private areas. There are four levels for sex segregation: permissive, voluntary, administrative and mandatory. 

It is always done in prisons and in military service. Socially it is done in sports, but not necessarily in mental sports. It is always done in schools in countries where the religion dictates it. Sex segregation is very unusual at primary school level.

Religion has its effects, but the Christian religion no longer mandates separation. It once did.

Clothing is the other area where differences occur. Again, Moslem countries still demand a dress code for women, but the rest of the world is more diverse. A point which is rarely made is that the simple wearing of clothes is often mandatory, and nudes may be arrested. Practice varies at certain places, such as the seaside.


Digital Compact Cassette

The Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) was a format of magnetic tape, developed to replace the compact cassette. It competed with the Minidisc and the Digital Audio Tape (DAT), but neither format could replace the compact cassette. It was marketed as a cheaper alternative to DAT. 

Equipment for the digital compact cassette was able to playback analog compact cassettes as well; recording could only be done to DCC, though. A DCC tape is similar in appearance to a regular cassette, except that it has reel access holes on only one side, and has a shutter covering both the tape and reel access holes, similar to the shutter on a floppy disk. This protects the tape and also prevents it from being accidentally inserted into an analog cassette deck.

Unlike DAT, DCC uses lossy data compression. This means that the copy of the data is not identical to the original. Audio data could be compressed to about 25% of its original size. 

The main problem of the format was tied to handling: Finding a song in the middle of a 90 minute tape takes several minutes. With Minidisc it is instantaneous. Minidisc allows to delete or move tracks, features which the digital compact cassette cannot offer. 

Even though some of the features were addressed (like rewinding a 90 minute tape in less than a minute), the format never gained much market share. The compression format used by DCC is based on MP1, which came before MP3. The CD-R, which is compatible with standard CD players, eventually replaced both DCC and MiniDisc for home audio recording. The CD-R also replaced analog tape.

Fat acceptance movement

The term fat acceptance movement refers to social movements seeking to change social attitudes regarding being overweight. The movement has a political and culture related background, and its activities include although are not limited to sports, shopping and fashion matters.

Forty-seven Ronin

The revenge of the Forty-seven Ronin took place in Japan at the start of the 18th century. It describes a historical event, but there is a lot of fiction added to the story too.

The story tells of a group of samurai who were left leaderless (becoming "ronin") after their daimyo (lord) Asano Naganori had to kill himself by committing "seppuku" (ritual suicide). He had to do this because he assaulted a court official named Kira Yoshinaka. The "ronin" waited and planned almost two years, and then killed Kira to avenge their master's honour. They delivered Kira's head to Asano's grave. After that, the "ronin" had to kill themselves by committing "seppuku" as they had committed the crime of murder.

One noted Japanese scholar described the tale, the most famous example of the samurai code of honor, "bushidō," as the country's "national legend." 


Femicide

The term femicide refers to killing women. Feminist Diana Russell is one of the many early pioneers of the term; she defines the word as referring to killing women because of their gender. The term was first used around 1801 in England to represent the killing of women. The term has created controversy, and other feminists differ on what the word "femicide" really means.
In Brazil, crime is in the Brazilian Criminal Code since 2012. The penalty for this crime is 12 to 30 years in prison.

Cinephilia

The term Cinephilia refers to when someone has a strong interest in cinema, movie theories and movie criticism. Since the silent era, there have been various waves of cinephiles, people with strong interest for cinema and movies. The movie community which may have been best noted in relations to cinephilia, however, are one that was developed during World War II around Paris, France. A major influx of foreign movies, alongside a screening program used with certain local movie clubs, generated interest for world cinema among the intellectual youth culture of the city. This community fostered a strong interest in directors and movies which may have been neglected, forgotten or simply not known in the West. Notable directors of French cinephiles in this period include although are not limited to Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles. This profession has become less connected with movie going due to presence of DVDs and VHS cassettes.

Declaration of Arbroath

The Declaration of Arbroath is a declaration of Scottish independence, made in 1320. It was a letter sent to Pope John XXII, dated 6 April 1320. The declaration confirmed Scotland's status as a independent, sovereign state and defended Scotland's right to use military action when unjustly attacked. The letter was signed at Arbroath by eight earls and thirty-one barons.

When King Alexander III of Scotland died in 1286, his heir was his granddaughter Margaret, Maid of Norway. In 1289, King Edward I of England negotiated to have his son, Edward II of England become her husband and share the crown of Scotland. But Margaret died on her way from Norway to Scotland in 1290. This began a period in Scotland called the First Interregnum (1290–1292). Scotland was without a monarch. Edward I stepped in to choose who would be king from among the candidates who had any claim to the throne. He chose John of Scotland. But, Edward treated the Scottish king badly. When King John tried to break free, Edward put him in prison, then allowed him to live in France. In 1296 Edward invaded Scotland with his army to take everything for himself. Scotland remained without a king until 1306 when Robert the Bruce declared himself king of Scotland defying Edward I. Just before doing this, Robert the Bruce had been involved in a dispute with John Comyn. The two met before the altar in Greyfriars Church in Dumfries in 1306 and a fight broke out. John Comyn was killed and Robert the Bruce was crowned king three weeks later at Scone. Accused of murdering Comyn, the Bruce was excommunicated by the Pope. During the wars that followed, the Scots won a major battle at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. In 1317 the pope called for a two year truce, which Scotland ignored. For failing to listen to him, he excommunicated all of Scotland.

The Declaration was part of a larger plan to show the Pope and others that Scotland was an independent kingdom and had a right to rule itself. The English king Edward I had written to the pope before confirming his right to rule Scotland. For his part, the pope refused to accept Robert the Bruce as King of the Scots. 
Dated April 1320, the Declaration of Arbroath was a letter to Pope John XXII at Avignon from fifty leading men of Scotland. There were 39 names, (eight Scottish earls and thirty one barons), who signed the document with their seals. On strips on the bottom of the letter are seals and names of eleven more who signed. Bernard Linton, Chancellor of Scotland and Abbot of Arbroath is believed to be the author. It was written at the monastery of Arbroath in Scotland. 
The letter began by reminding the pope of Scotland's conversion to Christianity by Saint Andrew. That under the protection of the church, Scotland had lived in peace until King Edward I of England pretended to be their friend. He then invaded their country while it was without a king. The letter then told of the hardships they faced under English rule. Showing their resolution the letter stated:

The pope was impressed by the declaration and with the promise by the Scottish barons to support the pope's crusade. He encouraged Edward II to make peace with the Scots. The pope sent two delegates. The French king also wanted to see peace between England and Scotland and he sent two delegates. Peace talks went on until 1321 without the English recognizing Scottish independence. 
The English convinced the pope it was the fault of the Scottish that there was no progress. The pope issued six rulings against the Scots stating all invaders of England would be excommunicated and re-issued the excommunication against Robert the Bruce.

Finally in October 1328 a peace treaty was agreed to between Scotland and England. Edward III gave up all claims on Scotland. The interdict on Scotland and the excommunication of its king were finally removed. The second part of the treaty agreed that the son of Robert the Bruce, David II of Scotland and the sister of Edward III of England would marry. The wedding took place on 12 July of 1338 when David II, then four years old married Joan of the Tower, aged six, at the church at Berwick, Scotland.

In 1998 The United States Congress resolved that the US Declaration of Independence has been modeled on the Declaration of Arbroath. It was further resolved that April 6th was from that day on officially National Tartan Day in commemoration of that famous document.

Over the River and Through the Wood

"Over the River and Through the Wood" is a Thanksgiving poem by Lydia Maria Child. It appeared in the second volume of her "Flowers for Children" in 1844. The original title of the poem is, "The New-England Boy's Song About Thanksgiving Day".

Boston College writes: "Starting with the familiar line, "Over the river and through the wood", this poem is easily Child’s most famous work. Child never revised the poem herself, but the verses changed over time, especially when they were set to music.

With its bouncing rhythms and high spirits, the poem draws on the writer’s childhood memories of visiting her grandfather’s house on Thanksgiving. Having gained notoriety for her ideas about race, Child kept her antislavery ideals out of this volume in an effort to avoid controversy and boost sales. "Flowers for Children" contains only two stories involving race, and they both avoid addressing racial prejudice head on. In this nostalgic poem, Child takes us back to the simple pleasures of a family holiday."

Cheer pheasant

The cheer pheasant ("Catreus wallichii") also known as Wallich's pheasant (in Nepal: "Kahir", "Chihir") is a vulnerable species of the pheasant family, Phasianidae. It is the only member of the genus "Catreus".

The species was named as "Phasianus wallichi" by the English zoologist Thomas Hardwicke in 1827; he named it after the Danish botanist Nathaniel Wallich. Later the name was changed to the present name by the English ornithologist John Gould.

The Cheer pheasant lacks the color and brilliance of most pheasants. The male has a brownish yellow plumage with black markings and a long gray crest; the skin of the face is red. Its long tail is mainly gray and brown, and has 18 feathers, something that puts this pheasant apart from similar species.

The female is smaller than the male, somewhat duller in plumage and more heavily marked, with reduced red facial skin, a shorter crest and lacking the male’s .
The Cheer pheasant is endemic to the western Himalayas; it is distributed in the highlands and scrublands (a place where small shrubs are abundant as well as small herbaceous plants, without trees) of the southern foothills, most frequently from of the western Himalayas, from north Pakistan, through Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal, India, to east to central Nepal.

Surveys in 1981 and 2003 in the Dhorpatan area of western Nepal found that there were 70 places where the birds were heard, suggesting that many birds exist in this area (approximately 200 birds). In another survey in 2010, Cheer pheasant was detected in 21 calling sites in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh.
These pheasants tend to be fairly (traveling in groups) for much of the year, with groups of five to fifteen birds, but form monogamous pairs during the breeding season from late April to June. They breed on steep cliffs during summer and the number of eggs in a nest is relatively large; there are usually ten to eleven eggs in each nest, though in some cases there as many as 14.

The Cheer pheasants get most of their food from the ground, digging with is powerful beaks; they eat roots, tubers, bulbs, seeds, insects and other small animals. They look for food mainly during the morning and evening, walking in pairs or, sometimes, in family groups.

In studies made in upper Beas Valley, it was found that the Cheer pheasants were sensitive to the presence of humans.

Due to ongoing habitat loss, small population size and hunting in some areas, the Cheer pheasant is evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES. The Cheer pheasant is legally protected in Nepal and India, and occurs in at least 12 protected areas in Himachal Pradesh, three in Uttar Pradesh and three in Nepal.

Attempts to reintroduce captive bred Cheer pheasants in Pakistan have been unsuccessful.

Sake Dean Mohammed

Sake Dean Mahomed (; 1759 – 24 February 1851) was an Indian traveler, surgeon and entrepreneur. He introduced South Asian cuisine (and Indian) and shampoo baths to Europe, where he also offered therapeutic massage., in addition to that he was the first Indian writer to be published in English.

At the age of 11, Mahomed joined the East India Company Army and rose to the rank of captain. He fought in a number of campaigns until 1782 when he resigned from the army and two years later arrived in Britain. Staying in Ireland he wrote and published his book, The Travels of Dean Mahomet. He later moved to Portman Square where he became an assistant to Sir Basil Cochrane at his vapour bath.

This is where Mr Mahomed is said to have added an Indian treatment, champi (shampooing) or therapeutic massage, to Cochrane's bath which became very fashionable.

Sake Dean Mahomed also developed a fashionable massage.

In 1810 he opened the Hindoostane Coffee House which was located off of George Street, near Portman Square, Central London. The restaurant served Hookah with real Chilm tobacco and Indian-style dishes. The premises is now a building called Carlton House.

To many who are now part of the city's expansive curry house business, Mahomed was a pioneer.

Although forced to declare bankruptcy in 1812, he created a concept that was to become something of a phenomenon 100 years later, said Vivek Singh, chef at the Cinnamon Club, a Westminster restaurant serving New Indian cuisine.

Mr Mahomed's plan had been to serve "Indianised" British food which would appeal to the Indian aristocracy in London as well as British people who had returned from India, he said.

"The Indian aristocracy however would not come out to eat in the restaurant because they had chefs at home cooking more authentic food - it was just not a big enough draw to come out."

A few years later he opened special treatment baths on the seafront at East Cliff, Brighton.

He died in 1851 and was buried in St Nicholas' churchyard in Brighton

Tuber

A tuber is the thickened part of an underground stem of a plant, such as the potato, with buds from which new plant shoots (stems and young leaves of a new plant) grow.

Most tubers are formed in the ground, but sometimes they can be formed above the ground, in the aerial stems; that is the case of the air potato ("Dioscorea bulbifera").

Tuber stems (or part of stems) are made bigger to store nutrients. Starch (formed by a lot of glucose molecules) is the most commonly stored food in the tubers, although other carbohydrates, such as inuline (formed by many fructose molecules), are stored in the tubers of certain kinds of plants, like the Jerusalem artichoke ("Helianthus tuberosus").

The purpose of tubers are saving food and reproduction. Under natural conditions, the parts of the stem that connect the tubers with the main stem die in the autumn or winter. The tubers are left in the ground and are able to produce shoots from their buds the following spring.

Potatoes are also artificially reproduced by tuber pieces, called "seed pieces". A tuber is cut into pieces, each with one or more "eyes" (an "eye" of potato is a group of buds covered by very small leaves). These pieces are planted and each produces a new plant from one of its "eyes".

A tuberous root or storage root, is a modified lateral root, made bigger to function as a storage organ; sometimes these roots are called "tubers" but they are roots, not modified stems like the true tubers. They are thus different in origin but similar in function and appearance to tubers. Examples of plants with important tuberous roots include the sweet potato, cassava, yam and dahlia.

PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale

PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale is a crossover fighting video game for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita game consoles. It was developed by SuperBot Entertainment and published by Sony Computer Entertainment America. It was released in North America on November 20, 2012, in Europe on November 21, 2012, and in Japan on January 31, 2013.

The game plays similar to Nintendo's "Super Smash Bros." series. The point of the game is to beat the character(s) you are fighting by knocking them off of the stage. During a match, players can collect orbs that are in a stage. Collecting orbs builds up a power meter that is at the bottom of the screen. When a player is hit, their meter goes down. When the meter is full, the player can use one of three very powerful attacks that can be used to beat opponents and get points. Up to four players can battle with characters from Sony's video games, including "God of War", "Sly Cooper" and "PaRappa the Rapper".


There are many different items from Sony's different series that can be picked up and used by players. They can be used by players to do better in the match or hurt opponents.

There are 14 stages in the game. Each stage is based on a combination of two games. For example, the stage "Stowaways" is based on the games "Uncharted" and "Bioshock Infinite".

Monarchy of Pakistan

The Monarchy of Pakistan was the form of government of the Dominion of Pakistan from 1947 to 1956. Under this system, Pakistan was an independent Commonwealth realm with a hereditary, constitutional monarch as the head of state. The monarch was the monarch of the United Kingdom, and was also shared with a number of other countries. The role of the monarch was defined under the Constitution. Most of the monarch's duties were carried out by the Governor-General of Pakistan.

The monarchy of Pakistan was created by the Indian Independence Act of 1947. This act, made by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, divided its British India into two new countries: India and Pakistan, each of which became an independent constitutional monarchy. Succession to the throne of Pakistan was, like that of the United Kingdom, governed by the Act of Settlement 1701.

Pakistan Adopted a New constitution on the 23rd of March in 1956. This constitution abolished the monarchy, making Pakistan a Republic in the Commonwealth of Nations. Pakistan left the Commonwealth on the 30th of January in 1972 over the Rebellious issue of the former East Pakistan province becoming a separate Independent Bangladesh. It re-joined on the 1st of October in 1989, then was Suspended from the Commonwealth twice: firstly from the 18th of October in 1999 to the 22nd of May in 2004 and secondly from the 22nd of November in 2007 to the 22nd of May in 2008-present.

Silvertip shark

The silvertip shark ("Carcharhinus albimarginatus"), is a large species of requiem shark, family Carcharhinidae, found in the Indian and Pacific Ocean. This shark has white tips on its fins. With an average length of 2-2.5 metres, the silvertip shark rarely reaches the length of 3 meters.

The silvertip shark is slender with a long and broadly rounded snout. The eyes are large and round. An interdorsal ridge is present on this species. The first dorsal fin is large with a pointed apex. It originates over or slightly in front of the free tips of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin originates over or just behind the origin of the anal fin. The pectoral fins are large and semifalcate with narrowly rounded or pointed tips. The caudal fin is asymmetrical in shape with a rather large upper lobe. 
The top of the body is dark grey or grey-brown with a bronzy sheen, and the underside is white. A white band, which is not clearly visible, is on its flank. 

The silvertip shark may be confused with the grey reef shark ("Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos"), but the grey reef shark has dark tips on the pectoral fins and trailing edge of the caudal fin. Also, the whitetip reef shark ("Triaenodon obesus") is similar in appearance to the silvertip shark. Although both shark species have white markings on the dorsal and caudal fins, the whitetip reef shark doesn't have these markings on the tips of the pectoral fins. The whitetip reef shark also has a more square-shaped snout.
The silvertip shark has 12-14 teeth on each jaw. The upper teeth are broad and strongly jagged. 

Silvertip sharks are found over continental and island shelves and offshore banks. They prefer offshore islands, coral reefs and banks to depths of 800 m. They are common in tropical oceans. 

They have been found in the western Indian Ocean: the Red Sea and of East Africa, including Madagascar, Seychelles, Aldabra Group, Mauritius and the Chagos Archipelago. In the western Pacific they are found off southern Japan to northern Australia and French Polynesia. In the eastern central Pacific they are found off southern Baja California, Mexico to Colombia, including the Cocos, Galápagos, and Revillagigedo Islands. 

This shark is a great hunter and is very stealthy. They are usually found in shallow waters, making them one of the most commonly seen sharks. Its unpredictable behaviour and aggressive hunting tactics make it a higher threat to humans than most other sharks.

Prey of the silvertip shark include benthic and midwater fish such as wahoo, eagle rays, wrasses, and tunas as well as small sharks. This shark also feeds on octopuses and squid. The silvertip shark has been observed swimming along the edge of a group of other species of feeding sharks, taking food from them.

The silvertip shark is viviparous, meaning that they give live birth. Courtship is a little different in these sharks and they are known to hold each other. Bites are normal, so much so that a female Silvertip shark has been found without a part of the dorsal fin after mating. Mating occurs in the summer. During the gestation period that could extend to a year, the embryos feed from the yolk and once the yolk is exhausted, the yolk-sac modifies itself into a placental connection through which the newborns feed from the mother.

The newborns are born in litters (normally 5 to 6 but can be from 1 to 11) and are anywhere between 63 to 81 centimeters or 25 to 32 inches long. The females are considered sexually mature once they grow to be about 2 meters long and in the case of males, it is 1.8 meters. The pups are known to swim with the mother shark in shallow waters before becoming independent.

Silvertip sharks are somewhat dangerous. According to the International Shark Attack File (ISAF), there have been four unprovoked attacks by this species on humans, with no deaths. Arguably, humans are much more dangerous to the shark. Silvertips are caught by commercial and artisan fisheries across their range using longlines, gillnets, and trawls, both intentionally and as bycatch. Their fins are highly valued for shark-fin soup and are sold on the export market, along with their skin and cartilage.
This species is vulnerable to overfishing (like almost all sharks) due to its slow reproductive rate. The IUCN has listed the silvertip shark as near threatened, and has noted that it may be approaching the criteria for vulnerable.

The silvertip shark is caught by fisheries in Indonesia, Myanmar and the Philippines. In the Philippines, it is in the top ten most caught species by number (0.73%), and weight (2.6%), with individuals ranging in size from 2.1-2.4 metres, and averaging 23 kg in weight.

Open University

The Open University (OU) is a distance learning and research university founded by Royal Charter in the United Kingdom.

The university is funded by the British state, and by student fees and contract income. It has an open entry policy. This means that students' previous academic achievements are not taken into account for entry to most undergraduate courses. Most OU undergraduate students are based in the United Kingdom and study off-campus. Many of its courses (both undergraduate and postgraduate) can be studied off-campus anywhere in the world.

There are a number of full-time postgraduate research students based on the 48 hectare university campus where they use the OU facilities for research, as well as more than 1000 members of academic and research staff and over 2500 administrative, operational and support staff.

The OU was established in 1969 and the first students enrolled in January 1971. The University administration is based at Walton Hall, Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, but has regional centres in each of its thirteen regions around the United Kingdom. It also has offices and regional examination centres in most other European countries. The University awards undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, as well as non-degree qualifications such as diplomas and certificates, or continuing education units.

With more than 250,000 students enrolled, including around 32,000 aged under 25 and more than 50,000 overseas students, it is the largest academic institution in the United Kingdom (and one of the largest in Europe) by student number. It is one of the world's largest universities. Since it was founded, more than 1.5 million students have studied its courses.

The OU was rated top university in England and Wales for student satisfaction in 2005, 2006, second in 2007, and top in 2012. These were United Kingdom government national student satisfaction surveys. Out of 132 universities and colleges, the OU was ranked 43rd (second quartile) in the "Times Higher Education" Table of Excellence in 2008. It was rated highly in Design, Art History, English, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Computer Science, Development Studies, Social Policy and Social Work, and Sociology. It was ranked overall as a nationally top forty, and globally top five hundred university by the "Academic Ranking of World Universities" in 2011, as well as being ranked 247 for citations of its academics.

The Open University is also one of only three United Kingdom higher education institutions to gain accreditation in the United States of America by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, an institutional accrediting agency, recognized by the United States Secretary of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation.

The Open University enrollments for undergraduate courses have dropped from a peak in 2009/10 of 209,705 to the latest published figure of 121,395 in 2016/17. According to The Guardian, this was caused mainly by the government. In 2012 it allowed fees for part-time degrees to rise to £6,750 per year, whilst severely limiting maintenance grants for students. Part-time courses at traditional universities in the U.K. have also suffered a drop in enrollment.

In her middle teens, Warren briefly taught school in Middleborough, then began appearing as an exhibit in a relative's "floating palace of curiosities" on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.

American showman P. T. Barnum heard of Warren in 1862. He invited her and her parents to visit him in his Bridgeport, Connecticut home. They did so, and Barnum found Warren, "a most refined and intelligent young lady, well educated, and an accomplished, beautiful and perfectly developed woman in miniature."

He hired her for his American Museum in New York City. She lived quietly in the home of one of his daughters in New York while he made arrangements for her debut. He assembled "a very splendid wardrobe" for Warren and provided her with "costly jewelry". She made her debut and created a sensation with the public.

Unfortunately, she was exhibited with Commodore Nutt, another little person several years her junior. He fell in love with her. She however did not reciprocate his feelings, and considered him nothing more than a "nice little boy". 

Barnum gave Warren a ring, which did not fit properly, so he told her that she might give the ring to Nutt while he provided her with another. She gave the ring to Nutt, and he regarded it as a love token. Warren was in great distress. She did not want to offend Nutt by repelling his attentions, but she did not want to encourage him either.

Barnum offered her $1,000 a week to exhibit herself at his Museum. She accepted and was an instant hit. The press adored her. She rivaled Stratton in popularity, and earned $3,000 a day for the Museum.

Warren met Stratton in 1861. They were married in Grace Episcopal Church, New York City, on February 10, 1863. Two thousand people attended their wedding, including the most celebrated persons of the day. 

Their "round the world" honeymoon included meetings with the Lincolns in Washington, D.C., and Queen Victoria in London. Barnum manufactured a hoax of the couple becoming parents (fueled with photographs), but Warren was, in fact, unable to bear children.

The couple travelled widely. They returned to Barnum's employ in 1881. Thumb died in 1884, leaving his wife penniless and depressed. On April 6, 1885, Lavinia married Count Primo Magri, an Italian miniature person who had come to America seeking his fortune. 

The couple toured, then exhibited themselves at Lilliputia (aka Midget City) on Coney Island. She met United States President William Howard Taft in 1911. She once boasted that she had met Lincoln and every president after him. Lavinia died in Middleborough in 1919.



Soccer mom

In America, a soccer mom is a middle-class woman in the suburbs who spends a lot of time taking her school-aged children to sports events and other activities. The soccer mom often drives a minivan, SUV or station wagon. Soccer moms are often completely involved and coach their children from the sidelines.The term "soccer mom" dates back to the early or mid 1980s. The term became more popular when newspapers began using it a lot in 1994 or 1995. It became very popular around 1996, when politicians were constantly using it during the presidential election of 1996, including then-President Bill Clinton.

General Tom Thumb

General Tom Thumb (January 4, 1838 – July 15, 1883) was an American entertainer. He was a four year old child when P. T. Barnum introduced him to show biz. The boy (who was passed off as a young adult) created a sensation at Barnum's American Museum in New York City. He toured Europe, appeared before royals, and returned to America rich. Thumb married Lavinia Warren in 1863, and continued to tour. Show biz took its toll on his health however. He died of a stroke in 1883. 
General Tom Thumb was born Charles Sherwood Stratton in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to Sherwood Edward Stratton, a carpenter, and Cynthia (Thompson) Stratton, an inn worker. He stopped growing at 18 months. He was 25 inches tall and weighed 16 pounds in 1842 when P. T. Barnum persuaded his parents to exhibit him at $3 a week. The boy was four years old when he left home for Barnum's American Museum in New York City.

Barnum molded the boy into an entertainer, and provided the child with an expensive and exquisitely tailored wardrobe. He was presented as General Tom Thumb and his age bumped up to eleven years. 

He debuted on December 8, 1842. At first, he was shy about appearing in public, but he took to the stage and began imitating famous little people like Napoleon and Cupid. The General was a hit. Thirty thousand people attended his first week performances.

Barnum and Thumb toured Europe in 1844 with an appearance before Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at Buckingham Palace. Other European royals also fêted him. In America, Thumb remained the principal attraction at the American Museum for many years.

In 1847, Thumb returned to America very rich. Thumb eventually bought a mansion in Bridgeport, and toured alone for a time. He teamed up with Barnum at times when the showman's bank account was running low. 

In 1862, Thumb met Lavinia Warren, another of Barnum's oddities, and the miniature couple were married on February 10, 1863, in Grace Episcopal Church, New York City. The wedding was attended by 2,000 guests, many of them the A-list celebrities of the day.

The couple toured for many years, and made a large fortune. In 1881, Thumb and his wife were caught in a hotel fire that almost took their lives. They joined the Barnum & London Circus. Show biz took its toll on Thumb, however. His health declined. On July 15, 1883, Thumb died following a stroke, age 45. He is buried in Bridgeport, Connecticut. More than 10,000 people attended his funeral.

Extended family

Extended family means a family including aunts, uncles and cousins. It also means married people living under parents of their husbands or wives. Within an extended family are several "immediate families".

A family with more than two adults is called a complex family. This includes extended families or families where there are more than just one mother and one father.

Juvénal Habyarimana

Juvénal Habyarimana (8 March 1937 – 6 April 1994) was the second President of Rwanda. He was president for almost twenty years, from 1973 until 1994. During his government, he favoured his own ethnic group, the Hutus. He was nicknamed "Kinani", a Kinyarwanda word meaning "invincible". Habyarimana was a dictator. He was suspected to have cheated in all of his elections.

On 6 April 1994, he was killed when his airplane was shot down close to Kigali. It was also carrying the President of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira. His assassination caused tensions between Hutus and Tutsis to worsen, and helped start the Rwandan Genocide. Within 100 days, somewhere between 800,000 and 1 million Rwandans were massacred.

Emmett Kelly

Emmett Leo Kelly (December 9, 1898 - March 28, 1979) was an American circus performer. He created the clown, "Weary Willie".

Jumbo

Jumbo (about Christmas 1860 – September 15, 1885) was the first international animal superstar. He was the first African bush elephant to reach modern Europe alive. He was born in eastern Africa, and captured there by Arabian hunters in early 1862. He was sold first to a traveling zoo in Germany, then to the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. He was traded to the London Zoological Gardens for a rhinoceros.

Jumbo lived in the London Zoo about 16 years. He was the biggest elephant in captivity. American circus showman P. T. Barnum simply had to have this huge elephant in his circus. He bought Jumbo in 1882. The elephant made his debut in the United States on Easter Sunday 1882 at Madison Square Garden in New York City. He toured with Barnum's circus for three years. In September 1885, he was killed in a railroad accident in Canada.

Jumbo attracted as much attention after his death as he did in life. His hide was stuffed and his bones preserved. His hide and skeleton were displayed first with Barnum's circus and then with museums. His hide was destroyed in a fire at Tufts University in 1975. His skeleton was displayed for many years in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. As time passed, children forgot about him. His skeleton was put away.

Jumbo's sale in 1882 created public anger in Britain. It drew the attention of people around the world. "Jumbomania", a fad for all things Jumbo, was born. The civilized world was flooded with Jumbo neckties, jewelry, and other souvenirs. People around the world were sad when he died. Jumbo's greatest legacy is his name. In the English language, it is now a word that means "very large".

It is impossible to know exactly where or when Jumbo was born. In February 1862, a British explorer met Jumbo in the desert camp of Arabian elephant hunters. This camp was on the border of eastern Sudan and Abyssinia (now, Eritrea). The hunters had been hired to capture wild animals for export to European zoos.

The explorer estimated that Jumbo was tall and weighed about . Based on his height and weight, Jumbo was about one year old. He was probably born at Christmas 1860.

Jumbo had a long, hot journey ahead of him. He walked several hundred miles with other wild animals to the Red Sea. At the port of Suakin, the little elephant was put aboard a steamship. In time, he arrived in Trieste, Italy. From Italy, he was taken by train to Dresden, Germany. He was then sold to a traveling zoo.

In late 1862, Jumbo was sold to the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. Jumbo was probably brought to his new home in either late 1862 or early 1863. The French were disappointed with him; they thought he would be larger. Jumbo lived in the Rotunda for Large Herbivores with two Asian elephants, several camels and giraffes, and a hippopotamus.

In October 1863, two more baby African elephants and several camels were brought to the Rotunda. The little elephants were called Castor and Pollux. They played together and slept together. Children loved the new elephants. The two animals came to be called "the pets of young Paris". Jumbo did not want attention from people; he stayed in his stable. Five elephants now lived in the Rotunda of the Jardin.

In April 1865, the government found that the living conditions in the Jardin were very bad. Officials thought some of the elephants should be sent to zoos in other countries. The officials of the London Zoological Gardens in Regent's Park wanted an African elephant. They traded an Indian rhinoceros and a few other animals for Jumbo. He was brought to the London Zoo in June 1865. Jumbo was lucky. Castor and Pollux were killed during a war with Prussia in 1871. They were eaten by the French.

Jumbo was very ill when he arrived at the London Zoo. He had not been fed properly. His hide was covered with filth that had to be scraped and scrubbed off. The nails on his feet were overgrown, and the soles of his feet were covered with sores.

Abraham Bartlett, the Superintendent of the London Zoological Gardens, put the little elephant into the care of animal keeper Matthew "Scotty" Scott. Scotty had a talent for understanding and managing animals. Jumbo grew stronger and healthier under Scotty's care.

The little elephant was named Jumbo. There is no record of the origin of this name. He may have been named after Mumbo Jumbo, a west African tribal holy man. This is not certain though. Bartlett may have named the elephant Jumbo because he liked the sound of the word. He had once named a gorilla Mumbo. There is a very slim possibility that Jumbo may have been named in Paris.

Jumbo became a great attraction in the London Zoo. Queen Victoria and members of the Royal Family adored him. Children rode in the saddle ("howdah") on his back for a penny. The young Winston Churchill (and probably Queen Victoria's children Prince Leopold and Princess Beatrice) rode in Jumbo's "howdah".

By the time Jumbo was seven years old, he had a huge appetite. Every day he ate of hay, a barrel of potatoes, two bushels of oats, fifteen loaves of bread, and lots of onions. He also drank several pails of water. If Scotty thought Jumbo needed some medicine, the elephant was given a gallon or two of whiskey.

In 1880, Jumbo hit his iron cage doors with his tusks and broke both off near the jawbone. He was in pain. He stopped eating. He leaned against the walls for support. Bartlett and Scotty were forced to perform some crude surgery with a harpoon-like tool they had made. Bartlett was disappointed with the damage to Jumbo's tusks. He had been hoping that Jumbo would grow to be a "tusker" an elephant with huge tusks. After the surgery, Jumbo kept his tusks worn away by rubbing them against the walls of the Elephant House. They never grew more than a few inches long.

In 1882, Jumbo was tall at the shoulder. He weighed more than . His trunk was long. It could reach high into the trees. In the magazine "Harper's Weekly", Jumbo was said to be "as gentle with children as the best-trained poodle dog." The magazine said he gently took biscuits and lumps of sugar from zoo visitors.

When Jumbo was brought to the zoo in 1865, Bartlett had wanted to raise the elephant himself. He needed a keeper who would obey him. He chose Scotty because he was rather inexperienced. Bartlett would be disappointed. Scotty had his own opinion on how to raise Jumbo. The close relationship that grew between the keeper and the elephant was something Bartlett hated.

In 1882, Jumbo was the biggest elephant living in captivity. Bartlett thought it best to find a new home for Jumbo for two reasons. First, he thought Jumbo was about to enter "musth". This is a difficult time in a male elephant's life. Certain glands in the elephant's head become inflamed causing the animal to behave violently. The other reason Bartlett wanted to move Jumbo was the elephant's close relationship with Scotty. Bartlett thought Jumbo might go on a dangerous rampage if Scotty should die.

Jumbo had tantrums. He would try to damage the Elephant House at night. He may have been frightened and angry because Scotty went home every night. He was only calm during the day when Scotty was nearby or when he carried children around the zoo in his "howdah". Jumbo's behavior only made Bartlett more sure that he must find another home for the elephant. Years after Jumbo's death, zoologists studied casts of the elephant's teeth. They discovered that his molars were erupting abnormally and probably causing him pain. This was likely the reason for Jumbo's tantrums.
