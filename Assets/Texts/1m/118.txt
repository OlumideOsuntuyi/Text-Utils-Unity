The show's unique name has been taken from common Bengali childhood rhyme. It truly captures the free-spirited love and chemistry between the protagonists - Abir and Shaluk. Life takes a turn when introvert city-bred boy 'Abir' meets the vivacious village girl 'Shaluk'. Their unusual friendship clicks in an instant and soon a sweet innocent chemistry develops between the two. Soon they realize their feelings towards each other. Thus, starts the story of their 'first love'. 'Eii Chhele Ta Bhelbhele Ta' is a tale of love, which follows the protagonists through myriad of situations and sees them unite against all odds. The story showcases a pure love story between two teenagers and how their love matures over time and rises above the different obstacles of life.

The show however has a lot of exist undertones too. The lead female character Shaluk is characterized as an all virtuous young lady without any faults .The writers and producers of the show, portray female lead characters idealistically instead of celebrating their faults as part of normal human nature. The supporting characters on the other hand are extremely blatant and malleable. They never show any strong or original viewpoints, as if the only reason for their casting is to complete a joint Bengali family. The male lead Abir is a polygamist and also narcissistic. He is a postgraduate student in Physics(it remains to be seen how that is possible because he is really stupid); without any source of income while staying in his parents house and without even trying is able to seduce two women to marry him. This is either because the women married him for the family heirloom or testimony to the dystopian mindset of the writers.

But in 1983, dissensions within the party led to a break-up of the MMM and the dissolution of the government in 1983. Twelve of his ministers, including Paul Berenger, resigned from the government. Anerood Jugnauth founded the Socialist Militant Movement (MSM) and built an alliance with the Labor Party of Mauritius on the one hand, and with the Mauritian Social Democrat Party (PMSD), Gaétan Duval, on the other. This alliance won the general elections held in 1983 and 1987. A coalition in 1990 with the MMM, sealing the occasional reunion between these two formations, allows him to win the elections of 1991, while the island prepares to abolish the monarchy to become a republic.

He remained prime minister until 1995. From 1982 to 1995, during which he led the Mauritian government, Mauritius experienced a profound economic evolution. In particular, from 1984 to 1988, the growth rate is around 7%. These are years of economic boom with the creation of a local industry. He had as Minister of Economy and Finance, successively in his various governments, Paul Berenger and Vishnu Lutchmeenaraidoo and Rama Sithanen.

He was Prime Minister after the elections of September 2000, then after 3 years, as agreed, ceded his position to his ally of the militant Movement Mauritian, Paul Berenger.

In October 2003, he became President of the Republic. In this republic born in 1992, the president has no decision-making power: his role is the symbolic representation of Mauritius abroad. The holder of the executive power is therefore the Prime Minister, a position he held for 12 years. He resigned from the presidency in March 2012.

In 2007, he threatened to leave the Commonwealth to protest the UK's treatment of Chagos residents. He said he could take the United Kingdom to the International Court of Justice over the fate of the islanders. The Chagos Islands, a British colony in the Indian Ocean, were leased to the United States in the 1960s to build a military base. The inhabitants were driven out and the government says they can not come back, but have obtained British citizenship. Most people live in poverty in Mauritius, or as refugees in the UK. The American base was built on the large island of Diego Garcia in the Chagos Archipelago. Mauritius claims the islands as part of its territory, and he claimed that his country was forced by the British to accept the Chagossians as a condition for independence.

On March 30, 2012, he announced his resignation, which took effect the next day, because of his disagreement with the members of the government.

He won the parliamentary elections in December 2014.

On January 21, 2017, he announced his resignation in a televised speech. On January 23, 2017, he is replaced by the Minister of Finance, his son, Pravind Jugnauth.

Jugnauth died in Floréal, Mauritius on 3 June 2021, aged 91.

Ke Apon Ke Por

The show comes from Boyhood Productions, one of the leading production houses in Kolkata.

Ke Apon Ke Por focuses on the journey of a girl that started out as a domestic help and went on to establish herself as someone who’s well suited to be the daughter-in-law of the household and a Lawyer by profession. Alternatively, what forms the core of the show is also reflected in the beautiful love story between Joba and the son of the very affluent family, Param. 

This story also brings to light the trials of a joint family where sons and daughters try to break away. Joba however, still tries to hold the family together. As parents try to build a family with a lot of love and care, sons and daughters grow up to be selfish and remain concerned only about parents’ money and property. As parents fear divisive tendencies in the family, circumstances get Param and Joba to tie the knot. Siblings rot over possibilities of paternal property going entirely to Joba and Param and eventually seize riches and drive the parents out. Param and Joba toil endlessly to hold pieces of the family together.

In the recent past, the story has taken a successful leap as Joba and Param face the bitter-sweet realities of being parents to kids that continue to grow up and grow apart. The show is also simultaneously establishing the position of Itu who happens to resemble Joba in more ways than one. Fate intervenes and Itu gets married to Sarthak, Joba and Param’s Son.

She lived with Joseph Smith and his family in Nauvoo, Illinois. She traveled with her husband to Utah, spending the winter of 1846–1847 at Winter Quarters. Winter Quarters was a camp where members of the church stayed during the winter. James asked the church leaders to be endowed and sealed. Endowment and sealing are special Mormon rituals for really good members. James was good enough for the rituals, but because she was black, church leaders said that she could not have the endowment. James kept asking, even though they said no. James was adopted as a servant into the Joseph Smith family through a specially created temple ceremony. After her death, she was endowed through another person in 1979.

In 1842, two LDS missionaries were preaching in the Wilton, Connecticut area. One of the missionaries was Charles Wesley Wandell. Ms. James' Presbyterian preacher told her that she could not meet with the missionaries. But she still wanted to listen to them. She wrote, "I went on a Sunday and was fully convinced that it was the true Gospel." James believed what they said. On the next Sunday, she was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. She later met many friends with her new beliefs. James and her family wanted to live near other members of their new faith. So, a year later, James and eight other members of her family moved from Wilton to Nauvoo, Illinois. It was her mother, three brothers, two sisters, and a brother and sister-in-law that moved with her. Wandell helped the group of nine and some other Latter-Day Saints start their journey. But their group had to stay in Buffalo, New York, because they could not pay the ticket price of the train going to Ohio. To get to Ohio, James and her family walked about 800 miles (1287 km). In a book that was written about her life in 1893, James talked about their journey. She said that their shoes broke, their feet hurt and started to bleed. She said, "We walked until our shoes were worn out, and our feet became sore and cracked open and bled until you could see the whole print of our feet with blood on the ground." James and her family were welcomed to Nauvoo by the Prophet Joseph Smith. Over the next year, her family was able to build their own homes. But James lived with Joseph Smith's family in Nauvoo until Smith's death in 1844.

The Spirit of the Laws

The Spirit of the Laws (French: "De l'esprit des lois", originally spelled "De l'esprit des loix"; also sometimes translated The Spirit of Laws) is a book published in 1748 by Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu. It is a book about law, comparing different ideas. The Books published by Montesquieu were subject to censorship. For this reason, the book was published anonymously, at first. The work was rapidly translated to other languages. In 1750 Thomas Nugent published the first English translation. In 1751 the Roman Catholic Church added "De l'esprit des lois" to its "Index Librorum Prohibitorum" ("List of Prohibited Books"). Yet Montesquieu's treatise had an enormous influence on the work of many others, most notably: Catherine the Great, who produced "Nakaz" ("Instruction"); the Founding Fathers of the United States Constitution; and Alexis de Tocqueville, who applied Montesquieu's methods to a study of American society, in "Democracy in America". Macaulay offers us a hint of Montesquieu's importance when he writes in his 1827 essay entitled "Machiavelli" that "Montesquieu enjoys, perhaps, a wider celebrity than any political writer of modern Europe."

Montesquieu spent around twenty one years researching and writing "De l'esprit des lois", covering many topics including law, social life and the study of anthropology, and providing more than 3,000 commendations. In this treatise Montesquieu argued that political institutions needed, for their success, to reflect the social and geographical aspects of the particular community. He pleaded for a constitutional system of government with separation of powers, the preservation of legality and civil liberties, and the end of slavery.

Oxalaia

Oxalaia was a large predatory dinosaur. It lived during the Upper Cretaceous of what is now Brazil, sometime between 100.5 to 93.9 million years ago. "Oxalaia" is known only from two bones of the skull, which were discovered in 1999. The animal was named in 2011 by a group of Brazilian palaeontologists.

It was a member of the Spinosauridae family, a group of crocodile-like theropod dinosaurs. Like other spinosaurids, "Oxalaia" had a long nose or snout with jaws and teeth shaped to feed on fish. "Oxalaia"'s habitat was tropical, an area of large forests around which were dry deserts. "Oxalaia" shared this environment with many other animals, most of which are also known from other Cretaceous fossils discovered in Africa.

In 1999, two fossil bones of "Oxalaia" were found in rocks on an island in the Northeast Region of Brazil. This part of the island gets covered up by the sea at high tide. Because of the action of the waves which cause erosion, the fossils were almost lost. Hundreds of other fossil teeth were also found at the same place.

The full name of the dinosaur is "Oxalaia quilombensis". The animal was named by Brazilian palaeontologists Alexander Kellner, Elaine Machado, Sergio Azevedo, Deise Henriques, and Luciana Carvalho. The first part of the dinosaur's name (the genus) comes from an African god. The second part of the name (the species) comes from the "quilombos", a group of Brazilian towns.

In 2011 the discovery of "Oxalaia" was presented at the Brazilian Academy of Sciences. Machado said that people are interested in spinosaurids: because of how different they are from other carnivorous dinosaurs, and because they are known by the public through the "Jurassic Park" movies.

Only two pieces of bone are known from "Oxalaia." The first is the tip of its snout, called the premaxilla bone. The second is a piece of its left maxilla, or main upper jaw bone. The two pieces were put on display in the National Museum of Brazil in 2011. The museum was burnt down in a large fire in 2018, and the "Oxalaia" fossils may have been destroyed.

"Oxalaia" is the third spinosaurid named from Brazil so far. The other two are "Irritator" and "Angaturama" (which might be the same animal as "Irritator"). These two animals are known from another part of Brazil, and lived nine to six million years before "Oxalaia".

To estimate its size, "Oxalaia"'s skull bones were compared with those of its close relative, "Spinosaurus". "Oxalaia" was probably long, and likely weighed . This makes it the largest known carnivorous dinosaur from Brazil.

The tip of "Oxalaia"'s snout, called the premaxilla, was long. "Oxalaia"'s complete skull was probably long. This is shorter than the skull of "Spinosaurus," which was long"."

The front of "Oxalaia"'s upper jaw was spoon-shaped, or larger at its front end than at its rear end. The bottom of the snout tip was curved inwards. This shape would have joined with the lower jaw, or mandible, which was also spoon-shaped. The roof of "Oxalaia"'s mouth had a very complex and bony surface, called a secondary palate. This structure made the upper jaw more sturdy, so it would bend less when feeding. The fossil snout preserves broad and deep holes. These probably contained blood vessels and nerves.

The snout of "Oxalaia" had seven tooth sockets on each side. It had one tooth in each socket, and there were two teeth underneath to replace it if it fell out. This feature is common in sharks, but not in most theropod dinosaurs. "Oxalaia"'s teeth were also oval in cross section, instead of flattened somewhat sideways like in most theropods.

"Oxalaia" is more closely related to the African than Brazilian members of its family. "Oxalaia", "Irritator", "Angaturama", "Ichthyovenator", and "Spinosaurus" are the only known dinosaurs from their clade that don't have knife-like (or serrated) teeth. This places them in their own subfamily, called the Spinosaurinae"."

"Oxalaia" can be separated from "Spinosaurus" by differences between their jaw bones"." For example: "Oxalaia" had a rounder snout, and more closely spaced teeth than "Spinosaurus". "Oxalaia"'s two replacement teeth per socket, and less smooth secondary palate, also make it unique among the other known spinosaurs.

The cladogram below shows "Oxalaia"'s relationship with other spinosaurids. It is from a study by Marcos Sales and Cesar Schultz:

Spinosaurids likely spent most of their time near or in water, feeding mostly on aquatic animals like fish. This way, they would avoid competing with other large predatory dinosaurs. Fossil evidence shows that spinosaurs sometimes also ate pterosaurs and small dinosaurs. 

The cone-shaped teeth of "Oxalaia" were built for impaling prey, instead of cutting flesh like those of most theropod dinosaurs. "Oxalaia"'s nostrils were placed far back on the head. This was probably to avoid water getting inside its nostrils when fishing. Both of these features were unique to spinosaurid dinosaurs, and were useful for catching and feeding on fish. The spoon-shaped front jaws and piercing teeth of spinosaurs worked as an efficient fish trap. This trait is also seen in the Indian gharial—the most fish-eating of modern crocodilians.

"Oxalaia" is known from the Alcântara Formation, a geological formation in northeastern Brazil. This formation dates to the Upper Cretaceous Period, sometime between 100.5 to 93.9 million years ago. Back then, the environment of the formation had a wet climate. There were large tropical forests made of plants like conifer trees, ferns, and horsetails. These forests were surrounded by an arid, or dry, landscape.

"Oxalaia" shared this habitat with many different kinds of animals. Other dinosaurs found in the formation included giant carnivores like "Carcharodontosaurus", and perhaps "Spinosaurus". Smaller predators lived there too, such as dromaeosaurids, and an animal very similar to "Masiakasaurus". There were also large sauropods, a group of herbivorous (plant-eating) dinosaurs. Fish found in the formation included bony fish, ray-finned fish, and lungfish. There were also giant coelacanths and sawfishes. Besides dinosaurs, there were other reptiles, like pterosaurs and crocodilians. Fossils of snakes and molluscs have also been found.

The fauna from the Upper Cretaceous of Brazil is very similar to that of Morocco and Egypt during the same time period. This is because South America and Africa used to be connected, in a giant supercontinent called Gondwana.

Ichthyovenator

Ichthyovenator was a meat-eating theropod dinosaur. It was from the Early Cretaceous, about 113 to 125 million years ago. Its fossils were found in Laos in 2010. "Ichthyovenator" was a spinosaurid, they were crocodile-like dinosaurs that ate fish.

It is one of three spinosaurids found in Asia, the other two are Siamosaurus, and "Sinopliosaurus" fusuiensis.

The first parts of the skeleton were found in 2010. They include: One rib, part of the animal's backbones (or vertebra), and most hip bones. They did not find the skull.

The only known species is "Ichthyovenator laosensis." It was named and described by Ronan Allain and his colleagues in 2012. It was found in the Grès supérieurs Formation.

The name "Ichthyovenator" comes from the Greek word for "fish" and the Latin word for "hunter", The name refers to the fact that it ate fish. The species name is "laosensis", because it lived in what is now Laos.

While "Ichthyovenator" was being described, paleontologists were still digging up more of its bones.

Ronan Allain was one of "Ichthyovenator's" original describers. In 2014, he mentioned that more of "Icthyovenator's" skeleton was dug up in 2012. He wrote this in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. These new bones include: several teeth, a hip bone, most neck bones, and a few back and tail bones. The description of the new bones has not been officially published.

In 2015, some of "Ichthyovenator's" bones were compared to the ones of "Sigilmassasaurus. Sigilmassasaurus" is another spinosaurid.

Paleontologists estimate "Ichthyovenator" was about long. That's about as big as Baryonyx, one of its close relatives.

It had a half-meter sail or hump on its back, similar to "Suchomimus", or "Spinosaurus". Ichthyovenator's sail was unusual because it was split in two at the hips. Scientists don't know why it was like that.

"Ichthyovenator" was first classified as a spinosaurid, inside the subfamily baryonychinae. This is the same subfamily that includes "Baryonyx" and "Suchomimus".

In 2014 it was found that "Ichthyovenator" was part of the subfamily spinosaurinae instead. This was because of specific features on its teeth, and because its backbones look much like the ones of "Sigilmassasaurus".

Some sources say "Ichthyovenator" might not have been a spinosaurid. They say it may have been a sail-backed carcharodontosaurid, and that it was related to "Concavenator". But this hypothesis has not been published in an academic place.

The diagram below is called a cladogram. It shows how "Ichthyovenator" is related to other dinosaurs in its family tree. This cladogram is by Allain "et al." (2012):

Shanghai Water Gate Museum

The Shanghai Water Gate Museum is a museum in Shanghai, China. It lets people see a water gate from the old path of the Wusong River (today's Suzhou Creek) from 700 years ago. It is free.

The gate itself is an important historical and cultural place protected by China's national government.

The museum's full name the . Its Chinese name is the "Shánghǎi Yuándài Shuǐzhá Yízhǐ Bówùguǎn". It is written as in the older writing used on Hong Kong and Taiwan and in the easier writing used on the mainland.

The museum is at 619 West Yanchang Road in Shanghai's Putuo District. It's at the corner of West Yangchang and Zhidan Roads.

Ren Renfa and his workers built the water gate on the Wusong River around 1300 during the Yuan Dynasty. Today, Suzhou Creek is small and less important than the Huangpu River, but it used to be bigger and more important for all the cities between Suzhou and the East China Sea. Dirt and sand in the river ("silt") slowly made it narrower and narrower. People built the water gate to help stop and wash away some of the dirt. The river changed its path to the south, the old gate became covered with dirt, and people forgot where it was.

Workers found the water gate in May 2001 while they were building new apartment buildings in the area. Once they understood that the stone their machines hit was a very old building, archaeologists came to look at it. The archaeologists started digging in January 2004 and finished in May 2006.

Workers started building the museum in November 2009 and finished on December 31st, 2012.

He has been praised by the media as having promoted the process of Đổi mới and policy reform in Vietnam since 1986. He was the master engineer of many of the bold projects of the Đổi mới period.

Đổi mới

Đổi mới is the official title given to the current economic system in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. It is described as a multisectoral market economy, where the state sector plays a crucial role in managing economic development with the possible long-term goal of developing socialism.

The socialist-oriented market economy is a product of Đổi mới economic reforms, which led to the replacement of the centrally planned economy with a market-based mixed economy based on state-owned industry. These reforms were implemented to allow Vietnam to participate in the global market economy.

Đổi mới-economic reforms were initiated by the Communist Party of Vietnam in 1986 during the party's sixth national congress. These reforms allowed private ownership of small businesses together with state-owned and collectively-owned companies. In addition, these reforms also played a greater role in market forces in order to coordinate economic activity between companies and public authorities.

Ferdinand de Saussure

Ferdinand de Saussure (26 November 1857 – 22 February 1913) is considered a founding father of modern day linguistics and semiotics. Semiotics is the study of how we attach meaning to the world around us and how we communicate that meaning to others. 

1857- Saussure was born in Geneva, Switzerland.

1870s- Saussure studied Sanskrit, Latin and Ancient Greek at the University of Geneva.

1876-1880- Saussure studies historical linguistics in the German cities of Leipzig and Berlin.

1880- Saussure received his doctorate in Leipzig. He moved to Paris to become a professor in historical linguistics.

1891- Saussure accepted the title of “Chevalier of the Legion of Honor” after teaching for 11 years in Paris, at the École Pratique des Hautes Études. He returned to Geneva, accepting a job as a professor.

1907-1911- For three years in a row, Saussure holds a lecture series about general linguistics.

1913- Saussure dies.

1916- Saussure’s students put together notes from the lectures and publish them in a book called "Cours de linguistique générale" or "Course on General Linguistics"

Saussure was a professor in historical linguistics, which is concerned with how languages relate to each other and how they change over time. This interest in how language changes over time can be called diachrony. Saussure was more interested in synchrony, which doesn’t change over time. This means he looked at the parts of a language, as if they didn’t change. Saussure studied the structure of language without comparing it to other languages and without focusing on change. 

Saussure distinguished two different parts of language, "langue" and "parole". "Langue" is the system of the language or the theory of the language. When we learn a language in school we are learning the “langue” of the language: vocabulary words, grammatical structures, the order of words, etc. "Parole" is how the language is actually spoken. Often times, people speak in a way that is different from how language is taught in schools. We make mistakes, use slang words, and use figurative language. This is all part of parole. Saussure was more interested in studying the langue of a language. Parole was harder to study because the language people speak changes often. Studying the langue allowed Saussure to understand the basic structure of language. 

Saussure wanted to know how people communicate language with each other. In his “Course in General Linguistics”, Saussure first defines language and how it is involved in speech.

Many different factors work together to create language. 
To summarize, Saussure describes language as our ability to represent meaning by using signs (the words themselves and the way they sound when spoken). In the process of communicating with another individual, language can be found in the process of taking meaning from the words that we hear (which make up an “auditory image”). This process is psychological, while producing signs is the physiological process of speech. To study language, we focus on the psychological process.

Language is studied apart from speech. It does not exist among one person but among the community of people that use it. Each member of the community shares a knowledge of the language but cannot change the system of the language individually. Language as a stable system can be studied scientifically, which is the goal of linguistics. 

Saussure also focuses on the arbitrary nature of signs.This means that a word and the sounds that make up a word don’t tell us anything about word means. For example, the word “dog” doesn’t tell us about what a dog is. The letters and sounds chosen are not special.  Most words are chosen in this way. A small amount of words are not. For example in the word “slap”, the letters sound like the noise you hear when you slap something. The arbitrary nature of sounds allows us to make many words. If every letter had a single meaning, then we could only create a small number of words with that letter.

United States federal government shutdown of 2018

A shutdown of the United States federal government began at midnight EST on Saturday, January 20, 2018, after a failure to pass a legislation funding bill for government operations and agencies and ended on Monday, January 22, 2018.

The shutdown was caused from disputes over the status of protection of persons affected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration policy, and therefore whether those covered under the program should face deportation. There was also a dispute over whether funding should be funded towards building a Mexico–United States border wall, a keystone policy during Donald Trump's presidential campaign.

This is the first shutdown in United States history to occur while both chambers of Congress as well as the White House are controlled by the same party (in this case, the Republican party). The 2018 shutdown began when the Senate failed to approve a House-passed bill to keep the government open. The shutdown began on the first anniversary of Donald Trump taking office.

Spinosauridae

Spinosauridae (meaning 'spined lizards') is a family of carnivorous theropod dinosaurs from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. They are unique among other meat-eating dinosaurs from their more water-based lifestyle, which involved a diet of mostly fish. Spinosaurid fossils have been found all over the world, including Asia, South America, Europe, Africa, and Australia.

Spinosaurids had longer arms than most theropods, the claw on the first finger was usually the largest. They evolved jaws like those of crocodiles, and their teeth were long and cone-shaped, made to trap prey in their mouths instead of tearing them apart. Because of this, their teeth usually did not have the strong knife-like edges (called serrations) of a lot of other meat-eating dinosaurs.

The family contains Spinosaurus, the first spinosaurid discovered, and the largest carnivorous dinosaur we know of. Paleontologists suggest it might have reached up to 15 meters (49 ft.) in length.

A study made in 2010 by Roman Amiot and his colleagues found that spinosaurids had very semiaquatic (living partly in water, and partly on land) lifestyles, this means they lived in habitats like those of hippopotamuses, crocodiles, and turtles, making them very unusual compared to other theropods. It also means they could exist at the same time and place as other large predators without competing for food. For example; Carcharodontosaurus, which lived at the same time as Sigilmassasaurus and Spinosaurus, did not need to fight with either of those animals for prey; those spinosaurids ate fish, while Carcharodontosaurus was on land most of the time, hunting smaller dinosaurs.

The family "Spinosauridae" was named by the German paleontologist Ernst Stromer in 1915, he was the one that discovered the first genus in the group, "Spinosaurus". And as scientists discovered more fossils of its close relatives, the family was eventually split into two subfamilies: Baryonychinae, and Spinosaurinae. This was done because of differences in the anatomy of their skulls and teeth.
This is a cladogram made in 2017 showing the relationships between different spinosaurids inside of megalosauroidea.

Pathet Lao

Pathet Lao was a political and communist movement in Laos that was established in the mid-20th century. The organization eventually succeeded in gaining the highest power in Laos after an internal war. war or revolution (against the French and American) that lasted from the 1950s to 1975. The organization had very close relationship with the Vietnamese communists. During the Indochina War, the organization was effectively organized, supported and equipped by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Battle of Route Coloniale 4

Battle of Route Coloniale 4 was a campaign in the First Indochina War carried out by the Việt Minh Army from 16 September to 17 October 1950 to break the isolation of the Việt Bắc base, clear the Vietnam-China border Bridge to receive aid. Another objective was to expand the base and destroy some of the French garrison force, experimenting with tactics for the People's Army of Vietnam at that time with little experience in combat.
In 1949 the French Army was still unable to advance into the Việt Bắc area. The control of the Northern Delta was slow but unstable. Việt Minh gradually reorganized its apparatus and forces, and began organizing large-scale battles against French forces.During the five years of the war against the French in isolation, the Việt Minh actively expanded relations to seek international support. On October 1 1949 the People's Republic of China was established and quickly recognized and established diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Then on January 18, 1950 the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries recognized and established diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The prestige and military capabilities of the Việt Minh Front are growing in the people.

During the same five years, the Việt Minh also adopted overseas Vietnamese organizations in France and left-leaning organizations to fight politics strongly influencing the French people's rising resistance to Indochina War. France fell into an unprecedented political crisis. The Vietnamese State lacked credibility among the people as a puppet government, and its army was too weak to cooperate with French troops in Indochina to win the war. The French government was forced to take into account the US government's plan to accept economic and military aid to pursue the war.

However, after five years of war French troops in Indochina became more and more bogged down in defense. In addition, although the development of the native force, but the quality and the fighting spirit is low it is almost impossible to undertake military tasks instead of the French.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals

The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) was an American immigration policy that allowed some individuals who entered the country as minors, and had either entered or remained in the country illegally, to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and to be eligible for a work permit. 

As of 2017, about 800,000 individuals—referred to as Dreamers after the DREAM Act bill—were enrolled in the program created by DACA. The policy was established by the Obama Administration in June 2012 and rescinded by the Trump Administration in September 2017. In November 2014 President Barack Obama announced his intention to expand DACA to cover additional illegal immigrants. But multiple states immediately sued to prevent the expansion, which was ultimately blocked by the courts.

Siamosaurus

Siamosaurus (meaning 'Siamese lizard') is a carnivorous theropod dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous of Thailand. It is only known from fossil teeth, so paleontologists don't know much about its size, but it might have reached a length of 9.1 meters (30 ft). The teeth that were discovered looked a lot like those of Spinosaurus, so it probably ate fish.

A study made in 2010 by Roman Amiot and his colleagues compared the teeth of spinosaurids like "", "", "Siamosaurus", and "" to other meat-eating dinosaurs. They found that spinosaurids had very semiaquatic (living partly in water, and partly on land) lifestyles. This means they lived in habitats like those of hippopotamuses, crocodiles, and turtles. It also means they could exist at the same time and place as other large predators without competing for food.

Cristatusaurus

Cristatusaurus was a carnivorous theropod dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous of West Africa. Its fossils look very similar to the ones from "Baryonyx" and "Suchomimus." 

The first specimens were found in Niger in 1973 by a French paleontologist named Philippe Taquet. The name of the animal refers to the Latin word for crest, ""crista"," because it had a crest on its snout. The species ""lapparenti"" is named after another French paleontologist called Albert-Félix de Lapparent. The fossils discovered so far include two broken snout bones, some pieces from the upper and lower jaws, a claw, and four backbones (also called <nowiki>"vertebrae"). Scientists aren'</nowiki>t sure if "Cristatusaurus" is a new species, some of them say it could be the same dinosaur as "Suchomimus" or "Baryonyx."

Sigilmassasaurus

Sigilmassasaurus was a carnivorous theropod dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of Africa. Its name means "'"'Sijilmassa lizard", referring to the name of the city near the place where its fossils were found. Its species name "brevicollis" is Latin for "short neck", because the neck bones of the animal are very short.
It was found and named by a Canadian paleontologist called Dale Russel in 1996, he found the fossils in Morocco at a fossil site called the Kem Kem Formation. The rocks the skeleton was found in are as old as the Cenomanian, which is the earliest stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, 100 to 94 million years ago.

Several large predatory dinosaurs weighing more than one tonne are known from the Late cretaceous of North Africa, this made paleontologists wonder how so many of them would have lived together. "Sigilmassasaurus" existed in the same time and place as other huge meat-eating dinosaurs like "Spinosaurus, Carcharodontosaurus, Deltadromeus," and "Bahariasaurus." The situation is a lot like in the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation of North America, where there were up to five meat-eating dinosaurs weighing more than a tonne, as well as many smaller ones. The difference between their sizes and what they ate could explain why they could live so close to each other, scientists compared this to how predatory animals live alongside each-other in the African savanna.

Suchosaurus

Suchosaurus (meaning "crocodile lizard") is a carnivorous theropod dinosaur from Cretaceous England, it was mistaken for a genus of Crocodile when it was found. The first fossils were of its teeth, two species have been named so far.

In 1820, scientist Gideon Mantell got hold of some fossilized teeth discovered near East Sussex, and in 1822, the British naturalist William Clift identified them as crocodile teeth. Two years later in 1824, Georges Cuvier mentioned them in the first interpretation of a spinosaurid fossil. But at the time, paleontologists didn't know about the crocodile-like teeth of spinosaurids

In 1897 the second species ""Suchosaurus girardi"" was named, after two pieces of its jaw and one tooth were found in Portugal.

During the nineteenth and most of the twentieth century, scientists thought that "Suchosaurus" was probably some kind of obscure Crocodilian. But in 1998, paleontologist Angela Milner was publishing a new description of "Baryonyx", and she realized that the teeth of that spinosaurid dinosaur were extremely similar to those from "Suchosaurus". Later in 2003, she suggested that they could be the same animal. "Suchosaurus" teeth are also very close to the ones from "Cristatusaurus" and "Suchomimus", all this means it has the general features of a member from the family Baryonychinae.

Robert Lowie

Robert Harry Lowie (born ""; June 12, 1883 – September 21, 1957) was an Austrian-born American anthropologist.

He was born on June 12, 1883 to an Austrian mother and Hungarian father in Vienna. He lived there until he was ten years old then moved to New York City. In New York he surrounded himself with German friends and family and even continued to speak Viennese at home. For the rest of his life he felt like a member of both American and German-Austrian cultures. He studied Latin, Greek, philosophy, and science at the City College of New York until he graduated in 1901. Then he worked as a teacher in New York City public schools for three years. In 1904 he started to go to Columbia University for graduate school and it was there that he met Franz Boas, a famous anthropologist. Boas became Lowie's teacher and role model. Lowie liked Boas because of their shared German background and similar interest in details rather than abstractions about human cultures. As a student of Boas, Lowie was tasked with writing a thesis about the Native American Crow tribe, which is what ended up sparking his interest in other tribes. He graduated from Columbia with his Ph.D in 1908 and worked at the Natural History Museum in New York City from then until 1921. He enjoyed researching and writing, so he continued to do those things throughout his life. He did extensive ethnographic field work during this time and studied more than nine Native American tribes throughout his lifetime. He was a teacher at UC Berkeley from 1921 to 1950.

One of Boas's main interests and most passionate arguments was that of individual variation. As Stefan Bargheer writes, "the notion of individual variability in the work of Lowie […started] in the 1910s […]. Lowie's argument was initially directed against race scholars […] who argued that the Nordic race displayed a higher range of variation than other races and could thus be assumed to produce a particularly high number of exceptional individuals, which ensured the superiority of the culture produced by this race." Instead he argued that there really were no differences in the range of variation between races. 

Although the popular belief in the early 20th century was that the white race was better than all others, Lowie argued against racism, saying that all races had individual variation present within them and that no one race was superior. He used statistics to argue that "the differences in cultural achievements between groups was a function of their population size and thus of the total number of outstanding individuals-not of the rate at which such individuals occurred."

He realized that because bigger populations have more people they are more likely to have a higher number of very smart individuals. He also applied his beliefs to primitive societies, arguing that they too had individual variation. In Primitive Society (1920) he argues "that mental processes are not only comparable but identical in the simpler and the higher civilizations." His interests were always primarily in culture and psychology. He specifically studied issues in race, environment, nature, and relationships. He believed that people were different, but he did not believe that one race was superior to others even though this belief was common during WWII when he was alive.

He fought for German scientists during the war, and against scientific racism, which is when scientific evidence is used to try to justify the discrimination against certain peoples. He also argued against the belief that cultures create people with identical personalities, spread by his two peers Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict. Mead and Benedict thought people within the same culture had very similar personality traits and that at least primitive cultures were more or less invariant.

His most famous books are Primitive Society (1920), Culture and Ethnology (1917), History of Ethnological Theory (1937), Primitive Religion (1924), Are We Civilized (1929), Introduction to Cultural Anthropology (1934), The German People (1945), and Toward Understanding Germany (1954). He even contributed 33 papers to Selected Papers in Anthropology (1960) between the years 1911 and 1957.

Maillard reaction

The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction between an amino acid and a reducing sugar that gives browned food its distinctive flavor. Seared steaks, pan-fried dumplings, cookies and other kinds of biscuits, breads, toasted marshmallows, as well as many other foods, undergo this reaction.

The reactive carbonyl group of the sugar reacts with the nucleophilic amino group of the amino acid, and forms a complex mixture of poorly characterized molecules responsible for a range of aromas and flavors. At higher temperatures, caramelization and subsequently pyrolysis become more pronounced. In other words, sugar and baked things become brown and caramelized due to this reaction. 

For example, the Maillard reaction happens when searing a steak.

Hardy also won a British Comedy Award for his work with Irish comedian Dave Allen.

In 2007, Hardy’s novel "Each Day A Small Victory" was published in the form of frontline despatches from amongst the embattled wildlife in an English country lay-by, illustrated by Oscar Grillo.

"Blue on Blue", Hardy’s darkly comic play on self-harm, was first showcased at the Latchmere 503 in London in 2007. The play was revived in 2016 at the Tristan Bates in London in partnership with BLESMA, the British Limbless Ex-serviceman’s Association. In 2008, Hardy’s one woman dysfunctional Cabaret, "There’s Something In The Fridge that Wants To Kill Me!", ran notably at the Edinburgh Festival.

Test cricket

Test cricket is the longest and oldest type of international cricket. The first officially recognized Test match took place on 15–19 March 1877 and was played between England and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where Australia won by 45 runs. 

The early test matches were played by England against other sides in the British Empire. First test matches took place in these years:


Test matches eventually spread to other countries around the world. Later came One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 internationals (T20s). 

Test matches are a series of 5-day matches. Each team's two innings' scores are added to find the total runs. The team with more runs wins the match if the other team has completed both of their innings, with there being a tie if they have an equal number of runs; otherwise it is a draw. 

Follow-on is a rule by which the team batting in second innings can be enforced to bat again just after the end of their first innings. The follow-on can be enforced by the team batted in the first innings only if their first-innings lead is at least 200 runs.

Minimum Lead Required


Timeless Test matches are Test matches with no limit on the number of days the game can be played for.

Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua

Zhong Zhong ( pinyin:"Zhōng Zhōng", born 27 November 2017) and Hua Hua ( pinyin:"Huá Huá", born 5 December 2017) are identical macaques that were made through somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), the same cloning technique that made Dolly the sheep in 1996.

Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua are the first cloned primates made this way. When other scientists tried to clone monkeys before this, they used donated embryonic stem cells, but Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua came from donated nuclei from fetal cells, which is harder to do. The two baby monkeys were both born at the Institute of Neuroscience of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai.

Scientists made the first cloned mammal, Dolly the sheep, in 1996 using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Since then, scientists have cloned 23 different kinds of mammals, including cows, cats, dogs, horses, and rats. But primates have been very hard to clone. Reprogramming nuclei that have been moved from one cell to another is very difficult. A monkey named Tetra (born October 1999), a female rhesus macaque, was made by a team led by Gerald Schatten of the Oregon National Primate Research Center using a different technique, called "embryo splitting," which is a way of making an artificial twin. Embryo splitting is not as hard as somatic cell nuclear transfer, and it can only be done from an embryo. So some people say Tetra is the first cloned primate and other people say Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua are.

In January 2019, scientists in China said they had made five identical cloned gene-edited monkeys using somatic cell nuclear transfer, like with Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua. They also used a gene-editing Crispr-Cas9 technique that He Jiankui said was used to create the first gene-modified human babies Lulu and Nana. These monkey clones were made to study several medical diseases.

Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua were made by scientists from the Institute of Neuroscience of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai. Team leaders were Qiang Sun and Muming Poo. They took nuclei from fiber cells of a fetal crab-eating macaque monkey or "Macaca fascicularis"). A fetus is an animal that has grown bigger than an embryo but has not been born or hatched yet. They removed the nuclei from egg cells (ova) and then put the nuclei from the fetal cells into these ova. The team used two enzymes to change the epigenetic memory of the donated nuclei so they would act like embryonic nuclei. They then put 21 of these ova with donated nuclei into surrogate mother monkeys. There were six pregnancies, and finally two living animals. These monkeys were named Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, after "Zhonghua" (, a Chinese name for China). Although this was still not many baby monkeys born, scientists think methods could become better in the future. The Scotland-based team that created Dolly the sheep in 1996 needed to try 277 times and produced only one baby sheep.

The older the donated nucleus is, the harder it is to make a clone. Fetal cells are harder to clone than embryonic cells, and adult cells are harder than fetal cells. The same team of scientists also tried to clone macaques using nuclei from adult monkeys, but it did not work. They implanted 42 mother monkeys, and 22 of them became pregnant, but there were only two infant macaques, and they died soon after birth.

Muming Poo said the birth of Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua does show people could make human clones, but Poo does not plan to do so. Poo also says it is important because it shows somatic cell nuclear transfer could be used to make monkeys that are genetically exactly the same, for experiments. Doctors that study the human heart already use crab-eating macaques as a model organism when they study problems with the blood vessels around the heart. Poo said monkeys like Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua could be used to learn more about neuroscience, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease when he talked on the radio news program "All Things Considered" in January 2018.

Academics who study right and wrong in science, like Insoo Hyun of Case Western Reserve University, asked if people would make human clones anyway. Poo told "All Things Considered", "Technically speaking one can clone human[s] ... But we're not going to do it. There's absolutely no plan to do anything on humans."

Parathyroid glands

Parathyroid glands are small endocrine glands in the neck of humans and all tetrapods ,embedded in the posterior surface of the Thyroid glands .

These glands produce parathyroid hormones (PTH). This has an important role in controlling the amount of calcium in blood and bones. Calcium is an important element in our body: it is the only element with its own control system (the parathyroid glands).

There are two pairs of parathyroid glands, just behind the thyroid glands. Each gland is about 6 mm long and 3–4 mm wide. Parathyroid glands get their blood supply from the inferior thyroid arteries.

DigiCel FlipBook

DigiCel FlipBook is 2D animation software that runs on Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X. It is intended to closely recreate the traditional animation process, very similar to the likes of TVPaint and Toon Boom Harmony.

FlipBook supports scanning physical drawings with a TWAIN-compliant scanner or webcam, or direct input via a Wacom tablet. In either case, the internal format is raster-based, not vector-based. Each frame must be drawn separately; FlipBook intentionally does not support skeletal animation or morph target animation, as these are not part of the traditional animator's toolkit.

FlipBook is available in four versions: Lite, Studio, Pro and Pro HD. The Lite edition supports one foreground and one background layer, one soundtrack, and up to three hundred frames per shot. The other editions support more layers, more frames, multiple soundtracks and higher output resolutions.

A free, full-featured demo version which produces watermarked output is also available for download.

FlipBook has been used on "The Simpsons Movie", "Enchanted", "The Princess and the Frog" and others, and has been endorsed by Don Bluth.

Kaduna State

Kaduna State is one of the states in the central northern region of Nigeria. Its capital is the city of Kaduna. It is one of the 36 states located in the northern area of Nigeria, and is the ninth largest state in the country. Hausa is Kaduna State's most widely spoken language, while English is its official language. Other local languages are also spoken, such as Yoruba, Igbo, Fula and English Creole among others. Some of these local languages are also used in written form. The total population of the state was projected to be 8,252,400 as of March 21, 2016.

The word "Kaduna" is thought to be derived from a Gbagyi word for river. Another proposed origin links the name to the Hausa word for crocodile, but this is challenged by the Gbagyi people who are known to have lived in the area for centuries. What is now known as "Kaduna State" is mostly made up of land said to have been inhabited by people of the "Nok" culture. The name "Nok" is derived from the village of Nok in Kaduna, where some of the first major artifacts from the Nok culture were found. The British colonial capital moved from Jebba to Zungeru in 1902, and then to Kaduna in 1916. The name Kaduna was taken up by Lord Frederick Lugard and his colleagues during the move to Kaduna.

Kaduna State is located at the center of northern Nigeria. It has political significance as the former administrative headquarters of northern Nigeria during the British colonial era.

Nihonium

Nihonium (ニホニウム) is a chemical element. It is also named eka-thallium. It has the symbol Nh. It has the atomic number 113. It is a transuranium element. The name "nihonium" comes from the name of Japan in Japanese, 日本 ("nihon").

Nihonium does not exist in nature, and can only be made artificially. It is made from the alpha decay of moscovium.

There are no known uses for nihonium. What nihonium looks like is not known because not enough has been made to see it with human eyesight. Based on trends in the Periodic Table it could be soft, silver color, very reactive metal like sodium.

On February 1, 2004, Nihonium and moscovium were discovered. A team of Russian scientists at Dubna from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and American scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory first reported the chemical elements.

On September 28, 2004, a team of Japanese scientists said that they had made the element.

In May 2006, in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research made nihonium using a different method. They found the identity of the last products of the radioactive decay of the nihonium they made.

Ununtrium was a temporary IUPAC systematic element name meaning "one-one-three" in Latin. 
Scientists from Japan suggested the name "japonium" (symbol "Jp") or "rikenium" ("Rk"). However, they picked Nihonium because not only is it discovered in Japan, but it means Japan, too, as Nihon is Japan or Japanese in Japanese.

Padmavati

Padmini, also known as Padmavati, was a legendary 13th–14th century Indian queen (Rani). Several 16th-century texts mention her, of which the earliest source is "Padmavat". "Padmavat" is an epic fictionalized poem written by Malik Muhammad Jayasi in 1540 CE. The Jayasi text describes her story as follows: Padmavati was an exceptionally beautiful princess of the Singhal kingdom (Sri Lanka). Ratan Sen, the Rajput ruler of Chittor Fort, heard about her beauty from a talking parrot named Hiraman. After an adventurous quest, he won her hand in marriage and brought her to Chittor. Alauddin Khalji, the Sultan of Delhi, also heard about her beauty, and laid siege to Chittor to obtain her. Many events occurred during the period of the siege, till the fort was finally taken. Meanwhile, Ratan Sen was killed in a duel with Devpal, the king of Kumbhalner, who was also enamoured with Padmavati's beauty. Before Alauddin Khalji could capture Chittor, Padmavati and her companions committed Jauhar (self-immolation) to protect their honour. After her sacrifice, the Rajput men died fighting on the battlefield. There is also a Bollywood movie called " Padmavati " which explains the story very well.

Many other written and oral tradition versions of her life exist in Hindu and Jain traditions. These versions differ from the Sufi poet Jayasi's version. For example, Rani Padmani's husband Ratan Sen dies fighting the siege of Alauddin Khalji, and thereafter she leads a jauhar. In these versions, she is characterised as a Hindu Rajput queen, who defended her honour against a Muslim invader. Over the years, she came to be seen as a historical figure, and appeared in several novels, plays, television serials and movies. However, while Khalji's siege of Chittor in 1303 CE is a historical event, many modern historians question the authenticity of the Padmini legends.

He also raced for former NASCAR driver Tony Stewart in 2007. Stenhouse signed a contract with NASCAR team Roush Fenway Racing in 2007, running in the ARCA Racing Series in 2008. In only his sixth stock car race, Stenhouse won for the first time at Kentucky Speedway. He won another race at Pocono Raceway and was running for the championship with Scott Speed before he and Speed crashed twice in the race so that both of them wouldn't win the championship.

After running in the ARCA series, Stenhouse drove for Roush Fenway Racing in seven Nationwide Series races in 2009 with Greg Biffle, Colin Braun and Jamie McMurray completing the schedule.

The following year, Stenhouse finished a career-best second at Bristol Motor Speedway; however, his crew chief was suspended the following week for a steering wheel problem. Overall, it was the best year of his Cup career.

Stenhouse finally broke through to Victory Lane in the Cup Series in 2017, winning at Talladega Superspeedway in his 158th career start. A couple months later, he won again, this time at Daytona International Speedway. Both of his wins came on restrictor plate tracks.

Video camera tube

The video camera tube was a type of vacuum tube used to capture television images between the 1930s and 1980s.

A video camera tube uses a lens to focus the image on a photoelectric material (a material which emits electrons when light hits it) housed at the front of a glass tube.

An electron gun at the back of the tube, like those used in a cathode ray tube, fires electrons at the material. When the photoelectric material is hit with brighter light, it produces more electrons, which cause more of the electrons fired by the electron gun to bounce back.

By measuring the number of electrons which bounced back, the video camera tube is able to tell how bright each part of the image is, and create a signal suitable for display on a cathode ray tube.


Martinism

Martinism is a form of Christian mysticism following with the fall of the first man, his state of material divine source, and the process of his return, called 'Reintegration' or illumination.

Tu Sooraj Main, Saanjh Piyaji

The story is based on the life of the children of Sooraj and Sandhya, focusing on their daughter, Kanak. Her grandmother Bhabho ignores and looks down upon Kanak because according to her, Kanak is to blame for her (Kanak's) parents' death, but later upon realising her love for Kanak, Bhabho accepts her as family. Later, Kanak gets married to a superstitious but good-hearted gentleman, named Uma Shankar. He is a blind believer in morals taught by his greedy and hypocrite maternal aunt, Nanda Devi. Kanak sets off on a journey with Uma Shankar to teach him the greatest moral of life - humanity - while she is criticized by Palomi and repeatedly harmed by Maasi Saa, and later, her lewd son, Aditya. In the process, she herself falls in love with Uma after establishing herself as the perfect wife for him. In a subplot taking place in Bangkok, Uma and Kanak plot to expose Maasi Saa and Aditya, and prove that Palomi is alive. They succeed in doing so and are about to live happily until Uma shockingly marries Meera Mittal, daughter of a rich businessman.

The story then takes a two-year leap and Kanak eventually reappears in Uma's life, who is now shown as a successful business tycoon. After a lot of misunderstandings, it is revealed that Uma still loves Kanak and he was actually blackmailed and forced into marrying Meera to save his sister Suman's life. Meera gets mad with jealousy and vows to destroy Kanak’s life. She and Aditya try to separate them including attempting to marry off Kanak to a man who is also after her, but fails every time and eventually get arrested thanks to a cunning plan made by Kanak. Aditya also realises his mistake and has a change of heart, becoming loyal towards his brother. Kanak gets rid of her hatred towards Uma and the couple are united again. It is then that Maasi Saa comes out of jail with the same evil intention.

Saras (Uma's sister) meanwhile suffers a miscarriage, and seeing Uma's grief over the matter Kanak with the help of Aditya launches a Bike Ambulance so that every emergency patient gets admitted to the hospital as quickly as possible. But this noble idea creates many enemies for Uma and Kanak and Dr. Parag, Dean of Pratistha Medical College joins hands with Maasi Saa to cancel Uma's license so that he can use the idea to build his own Medical College and take the credit wholly upon himself. Kanak decides to study Paramedicine and become a doctor herself to save the license from being cancelled so no one can label her as amateur when she treats any patient. After facing several hurdles and hindrances in the college set up by Dr. Parag, she at last succeeds in removing the mask out of Dr. Parag's face, unveiling his true nature in front of the public and gets him put in prison. It is revealed that Maasi Saa was ill-treated by Dr. Parag while in jail, and she was planning for revenge ever since she got out of jail. She later stops plotting against Uma and Kanak and becomes kind towards them.

Uma at this time receives a fake call and gets attacked by some goons who also trash his Bike Ambulance. He recovers some months later, but loses his memory and to everyone's surprise turns into that same superstitious person he used to be before. He asks Kanak to either choose him or to pursue the Paramedics course as he is against the idea of her studying. However, Kanak chooses to continue her dream of becoming a doctor. Uma supports her decision and Aditya then reveals that it was Uma's plan all along to infuse some confidence and passion inside Kanak which she was lacking, and that he never lost his memory. With her husband at her side, the story finally ends on a happy note as Kanak sets off for her new career with the blessings of Bhabo and other elders.

Synthetic division

Synthetic division is a way to divide polynomials. It takes up less space than polynomial long division. It is mostly used to divide a polynomial by a binomial that looks like this:
but it can be divided by any polynomial with one variable.

Synthetic division can be used to make calculations without writing variables. It also uses a small number of calculations, and takes less room on paper than long division. The subtractions in long division are changed to additions by changing the signs at the very beginning, which keeps sign errors from happening.

Synthetic division for linear denominators is also called division in Ruffini's rule.

The first example is synthetic division with a denominator formula_2 that only has one variable.
The coefficients of the polynomial to divide are put at the top (the zero is for the unseen formula_4).
Make the coefficients of the denominator their opposite.
Put every coefficient of the divisor except the first one on the left.
Put the first number after the bar, 1, at the bottom.
Multiply the dropped number by the number before the bar, and put it under the next coefficient, 12.
Add the numbers in the second column (which equals -9 in this example).
Do the last two steps again to get this:
Count the terms to the left of the bar. Since there is only one, the remainder has degree zero, which means it is a constant that is more than zero. Put an up and down line next to the last number, -123.
The terms are written with a rising degree from right to left. It begins with degree zero for both the remainder and the result.
The last part of the division is:

Duty

Duty is a term that conveys a sense of moral commitment or obligation to someone or something. The moral commitment usually results in action and is not a matter of passive feeling or mere recognition. When someone recognizes a duty, that person theoretically commits himself to its fulfillment without considering their own self-interest. This is not to suggest that living a life of duty entirely precludes a life of leisure; however, its fulfillment generally involves some sacrifice of immediate self-interest. Typically, "the demands of justice, honor, and reputation are deeply bound up" with duty.

Cicero discusses the concept of duty in his work “On Duty". There, he suggests that duties can come from four different sources:

Other uses of the word have sprung from the root idea of obligation, a concept involved in the notion of duty. For example, the concept is used to describe the services performed by a minister of a church, by a soldier, or by any employee or servant.

Many schools of thought have debated the idea of duty. Many assert mankind's duty on their own terms, but some philosophers have absolutely rejected a sense of duty.

Duty has to be accepted and understood on the basis of one's foundation of sense and knowledge. Therefore, duty and its manifestations vary with values from culture to culture. On one hand duty may be seen as terms of reference, job description, or behavior - and it is all of that ... but duty is not only about doing things right, it is about doing the right thing.

History of pizza

The history of pizza begins when different ancient cultures produced flatbread with toppings. Toppings are food added to pizza, like pepperoni, cheese or sausage. Foods similar to pizza have been made since the Neolithic Age. The food that came before pizza was probably focaccia (a flatbread to which toppings were added). The word "pizza" was first documented in AD 997 in Gaeta, Italy. The word came later in parts of Central and Southern Italy.

The innovation that led to flatbread pizza was the use of tomato as a topping. For some time after the tomato was brought to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, it was believed by many Europeans to be poisonous.

Modern pizza was developed in Naples, Italy, when tomato was added to focaccia in the late 18th century. Pizza, though, was mainly eaten "in" the country of Italy.

By the late 18th century, it was common for the poor in and around Naples to add the tomato to their yeast-based flatbread. That's when pizza began.

Pizzas need to be baked at temperatures of 200250 °C. Not many household ovens could reach such temperatures before the late 1800s. Because of this, pizza was made at home, and then given to the town bakery to bake.

In June 1889, Raffaele Esposito, a chef from Naples, created the "Margherita" in honour of Queen Margherita. It was the first pizza to include cheese. Most pizzas include cheese as a topping.

Pizza first made its appearance to the United States in the 19th century when Italian immigrants came to the country. It was very popular with Italian people in New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia and St. Louis.

Allied troops in Italy came to enjoy pizza and other Italian foods during World War II.

The first printed reference to the word "pizza" in the U.S. was in 1904 in "The Boston Journal".

Non-cooperation movement

The "'Non-Cooperation Movement" was a significant phase of the Indian independence movement from British rule. It was led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi after the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre. It aimed to resist British rule in India through non-violent means or "satyagraha". Protestors would refuse to buy British goods, adopt Nihal use of local handicrafts and picket and liquor shops. The ideas of Ahimsa and nonviolence, and Gandhi's ability to rally hundreds of thousands of common citizens towards the cause of Indian independence, were first seen on a large scale in this movement through summer 1920. Gandhi feared that the movement might lead to popular violence. The non-cooperation movement was launched on 4th September 1920. This movement became a breakthrough and in a way helped India achieve Independence.
It was called off in February 1922 when a group of peasants lit fire to the police station in chauri chaura located in Uttar Pradesh and ended the non-cooperation.

Three Kingdoms

Three Kingdoms is the name of a historical period in Ancient China. This period lasted from about 180 or 220, to about 280. During this period, China was split between the kingdoms of Wei, Shu Han and Wu. After the fall of the Han dynasty, there were three important successors. However, none of the three was strong enough to win against the two others. During the Han dynasty, China had an emperor. After the end of the Han dynasty, three kingdoms were left. Chinese historians were unable to decide if there was a legitimate sucessor to the last Han emperor. 
The last Han emperor Xian left power in 220, and handed it to Xao Pi. Jin Wudi was able to unite China again in 280. Between the two years was the period of the three kingdoms. 

In the year 189, the central government lost most of its power. For this point on, it was unable to do much. For this reason, many people think that the time of the Three Kingdoms already started in 189.

MPB representative Laszlo Szabó said of this, "The successes at the Rio Games gave new impetus to Hungarian athletes. We are proud to be able to represent our country at the Winter Paralympics, and in the last Winter Games organized in Sochi there was no Hungarian sportspeople. It's a great success that we can start in three of the six sports contested Winter Paralympic Games, thanks to the great athletes and their coaches whose work here is to be thanked." The three spots was one more than the government had been targeting earlier in the year. The goal was to earn two spots.

In autumn of 2017, responsibility for sending a team to the Paralympics was changed from Parasport Denmark, the National Paralympic Committee of Denmark, to National Olympic Committee and Sports Confederation of Denmark (DIF). The decision was made because people wanted to make Olympic and Paralympic sport more equal. Niels Christiansen, secretary general of Parasport Denmark, said, "We are very happy with the move, and we look forward to working together with DIF. The Paralympics and the development and preparation of world class Para-athletes is still very much a focal point of our work in Parasport Denmark, but allowing DIF to take the reigns sends an important message and hopefully it will lead to even more Paralympic success for Denmark." Despite this change, Parasport Denmark was still in charge of preparing to send a team to the Winter Paralympic Games.

Denmark first went to the Winter Paralympics in 1980 in Geilo.  Before South Korea, they had won a total of two gold medals, one silver medal and three bronze medals at the Winter Games. Both of their gold medals and all of their bronze medals were won by para-Nordic blind skier Anne-Mette Bredahl. Her gold medals were in the biathlon 7.5 kilometres free technique B 1-3 race.

I am very glad that successful athletes are being prepared in our region to achieve great results. When the representatives of the Center approached me with the request for support and support, I did not hesitate and I am glad that the Hradec Králové Region is one of the partners of the Czech representatives."

Patrik Hetmer was the first skier to be nominated for inclusion on the 2018 team going to Pyeongchang. He competed at the 2014 Winter Paralympics. Hetmer has a vision impairment. The blind skier races with guide skier Miroslav Máčka. Anička Pešková was the only woman representing the Czech Republic in Pyeongchang.

The team had a goal of winning a bronze at the 2018 Winter Paralympics. They thought their biggest competition would be the United States and Canada. It was the third time the Czech Republic had gone to the Winter Paralympics. Their first appearance at the Winter Games was in 2010. They went again in 2014.

In the two years before the start of the Winter Games, the sledge hockey team dealt with financial difficulties. Corruption in the Czech Republic involving subsidies for sport resulted in the national team getting less money to support their training and ability to compete in tournaments. FAČR Chairman Miroslav Pelta was arrested as part of the corruption issues. About the corruption, team captain Zdeněk Šafránek said, "The subsidy scandal has radically reduced the amount we receive. For the sake of illustration, the Czech Paralympic Committee has now gotten less money than last year's sledge hockey players, and it has to be divided into a lot of sports." The team could not buy time to use ice at skating rinks to train much before their final qualifying competition in Sweden. They also could not buy new equipment like sledges, hockey sticks or hockey gloves. To make sure they were ready to qualify, the captain thought the team needed around 1 million Czech Koruna () to pay for all the costs of training and traveling. Because they could not get funding from the government, players had to ask individuals to support them financially.

The team went to Nagano to compete in a tournament in February 2018 to prepare for the Games.

Japan, Sweden and the Czech Republic were the last 3 teams that were able to go to the 2018 Games. They could go because of how they finished at the Qualification Tournament in October in Ostersund, Sweden in October 2017.

Blind skier Jon Santacana and guide skier Miguel Galindo Garces competed at the Paralympics before in 2002, 2006, 2010 and the 2014. Astrid Fina Paredes went to the 2014 Winter Paralympics.

Spain sent 4 people to the 2018 Winter Paralympics. They were snowboards and alpine skiers. The team went to an event in Madrid on 26 February 2018 in Madrid. After the event, they went to South Korea.

The table below contains the list of members of people (called "Team Spain") that will be participating in the 2018 Games.
Traditionally, the United States, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden have been the best countries at the Winter Paralympics. Spain has not sent many people, and has not won many medals. One of the reasons is that there are not many places to ski, and it is very expensive. This discourages people from trying winter sports. Paralympic sports are also treated the same as women's sports in Spain. They are hidden away, and the media gives little coverage to the sporting accomplishments of its elite Paralympic sportspeople. While Olympic people have guaranteed money because of Plan ADO, Paralympic people get much less money from Plan ADOP. The money they get is also much less secure, changing from year to year. This makes it difficult for Spanish Paralympic people to plan in advance their practice and competition calendar. Olympic people get money for the year. Paralympic people only get money for a month. The next month, they may not get any money from Plan ADOP. While Spain has a lot of people with disabilities, only 0.5% have a sports license.

There were some issues related to clothing making Joma sponsoring the Winter Paralympic team. The company already sponsored the 2018 Spanish Winter Olympic team. This started during preparations for the 2016 Summer Paralympics. Joma wanted to provide clothing for only some members of the Spanish team going to Rio de Janeiro. They did not want to provide clothes for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the Summer Paralympics. The company cited a lack of commercial visibility for the Paralympic Games as the reason they wanted to do this. While Joma was not providing clothing for all team members for all parts of the Summer Paralympics, the company created advertising saying they were official sponsors of the team. The Spanish Paralympic Committee did not consider them to be sponsors as they were not providing everyone with clothing. They asked Joma to stop what they thought was deceptive advertising. The Spanish Paralympic Committee also considered taking legal action against Joma. The Summer Paralympics became the first Paralympic Games in 20 years where the Spanish Olympic and Paralympic teams did not have the same clothing sponsor. This situation continued with the 2018 Winter Paralympics.

Jon Santacana competed at the 2002, 2006, 2010 and the 2014 Winter Paralympics with his guide, Miguel Galindo Garces. He won eight medals between 2002 and 2014 at the Paralympics. Three were gold. Three were silver. Two were bronze.

Spain sent two snowboarders to the Paralympic Games in South Korea. They were Astrid Fina Paredes and Víctor González. They are members of Federación Española de Deportes de Personas con Discapacidad Física, a sport organization for people with physical disabilities.

Astrid Fina Paredes went to the IPC World Cup 2017 in La Molina, Spain.  She won two silver medals.  The World Cup was part of her training for the 2018 Winter Paralympics.  In February 2017, she went to the IPC Para-Snowboarding World Championships in Big White, Canada. She finished fourth in the snowboard slalom race and fifth in the snowboard cross race. In 2017, she wanted to go to the 2018 Paralympic Games and win a medal. Her fear was she would get hurt. This would make it difficult to race and get a medal. She leaves for South Korea on 2 March 2018, with her first race on 12 March and her second one 15 March.

Astrid Fina Paredes was at the 2014 Winter Paralympics, with the 2018 Games being her second Games. At Sochi 2014, she finished sixth in snowboard cross. From Barcelona, Fina Paredes has a physical disability because of a traffic accident in 2009. In 2013, her leg was amputated. She started para-snowboarding that year. It was one year from when she start that she went to Sochi. Participating in snowboarding costs a lot of money. To continue to practice and compete in the southern hemisphere during 2016, she needed to rent out her apartment in Spain. Team Spain had no money to help her.

Víctor González was a snowboarder. He had an accident. Because of the accident, he got a disability in his legs. After the accident, he switched to para-snowboarding.

The snowboard cross event starts on 12 March, running from 10:30 AM to 5:00 PM for all classes for both men and women. The slalom race is scheduled to take place on 16 March, going from 10:30 AM – 4:55 PM for men and women in all classes.

The Government of Spain said there was 135,000 € total to give to Spanish sportspeople who won medals at the 2018 Games. If a person won a gold medal, they got up to 30,000 €.  If a person won a silver medal, they got up to 15,000 €.  A person with a bronze medal got up to 9,000 €. These totals have been criticized. At the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, the government allocated 1,861,000 € for Olympic medalists but only 684,000 € to people who won medals at the Paralympics. The individual totals are still better than the past. At the 2012 Summer Paralympics, Olympic gold won a person 94,000 € but a gold medal at the Paralympics only won a person 10,000 €.

South Korea at the 2018 Winter Paralympics

South Korea sent people to compete at the 2018 Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. South Korea and North Korea will enter the Opening Ceremonies as one team, walking behind a unification flag. South Korea is competing in sledge hockey.

The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) said North Korea was going to participate in the Winter Games for the first time. The North Koreans will competing under a Korean unification flag like their delegation for the 2018 Winter Olympics did. This is the first time that North Korea went to the Winter Paralympics. The country had gone to the 2012 Summer Paralympics and the 2016 Summer Paralympics. On 1 January 2018, Kim Jong-un said he wanted to have North Koreans competing at the 2018 Winter Olympics and Paralympics. North Koreans had a meeting with the IPC in Lusanne, Switzerland on 20 January 2018. At the meeting, North Korea and South Korea asked the IPC if they could compete as one team.

I expect that now the preparations for the Paralympic Games will be relaxed and fully dedicated." Slivnik said after qualifying for the Paralympics, "Before the first run there were some problems with the track, but the Kranjska Gora team did a great job and prepared a track that was excellent. In the second, the track was already slightly slapped. I made a little mistake, but I did not want to give in, I wanted to aim. I did it.

At the 2010 and 2014 Games, Romania was represented by one skier, Laura Văleanu.

Romania sent only one person to the 2018 Games. The person was Mihaita Papara. He competes in para-snowboarding 

The table below contains the list of members of people (called "Team Romania") that will be participating in the 2018 Games.
The Romanian National Paralympic Committee has few employees. They also have very little money. Despite this, they try very hard to help all sportspeople with disabilities in Romania. Their 2014 budget was for twelve sports. Snowboard became their thirteenth sport. This happened after Mihaita Papara asked the Committee Chairperson Sally Wood Lamont to support him. In 2016, the budget for the Romanian National Paralympic Committee increased. The year of the Summer Paralympics, their budget was . In comparison, Croatia had a budget of in 2015. They money increased because Romanians did well in international competitions. Because the costs to compete are very high, the money was still not enough. There are few sponsors for disability sportspeople in Romania. The Paralympic Games do not get much media coverage. This makes it very difficult for people in Romania to go to the Paralympic Games.

Papară started snowboarding after a car accident. Snowboarding made his life more normal. It was more like life before his accident. He started using a new knee prosthesis in 2012. It was exhausting. He could have tried to go to the 2014 Winter Paralympics. He chose not to. Because he would not have been at his best, Papară thought it was not honorable to go. He also did not have much experience competing at snowboarding. By 2018, things had changed. Papară had participated in a lot more races. He had more experience. His fitness was better. He entered his first international snowboard race in November 2014. Before his first race, a little voice in his head said, "Wait, what you're doing, it's too risky, you're going to hurt yourself, give up!" The prosthetic he uses to snowboard costs . The Romania Olympic Committee assisted in paying for part of his prosthetic.

Laura Văleanu is Papară's role model. Her amputation is similar to his. She was a skier. She represented Romania at the 2010 Winter Paralympics. Those were the first Winter Paralympics Romania went to. Sport was a passion for her. It assisted in her recovery. Papară tried to do the same as Văleanu. Sport became a way to regain life.

Papară was in a car accident in 3 September 2005. Because of the accident, doctors amputated his leg. After the accident, he tried to live a normal life.  He tried to make sure his amputation did not mean he could not do things he wanted to do. He said, "The recovery after such an accident, after an amputation is very difficult and lasting. If I were to give advice to a person in the same situation, I would tell them to start a physical activity, to start sport as soon as possible."

Papară is from Gheorgheni, Harghita. He was born in Harghita.

In early February, Papară went to a World Cup in Canada. He was in the banked slalom and snowboard cross races. He said it was important people in Romania saw him snowboarding. He thinks it will help change people's mind about what people with disabilities can do. He wants to be a role model for others with disabilities.

The snowboard cross event starts on 12 March. It starts at 10:30 AM and goes to 5:00 PM for all classes for both men and women. The slalom race is scheduled to take place on 16 March. It goes from 10:30 AM – 4:55 PM. Men and women in all classes are racing at that time.

Poland at the 2018 Winter Paralympics

Poland sent people to compete at the 2018 Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. People will compete in cross-country skiing, para-alpine skiing, biathlon and para-snowboarding. Team members include Katarzyna Rogowiec and Igor Sikorski.

In January 2018, Poland thought their team for the 2018 Games would include ten sportspeople in four sports: cross-country skiing, para-alpine skiing, biathlon and para-snowboarding. The complete list of all members of Team Poland was shared in February 2018.

The table below contains the list of members of people (called "Team Poland") that will be participating in the 2018 Games.

It can be difficult for people with disabilities to participate in winter sports. Katarzyna Rogowiec said the reason is because people are more dependent on others. They need help to put on jackets. They may need help to get into a special chair. It can be difficult to stay warm when you do not have hands. Winter sports are also very expensive. The cost makes it difficult for many people to participate.

Poland did not win any medals at the 2014 Winter Paralympics. Poland won a bronze medal at the 2010 Winter Paralympics. Polish Paralympic Committee President Łukasz Szeliga said the goal of Poland is to have better finishes than 2010 and 2014. They would like to win at least one medal.

The team includes Igor Sikorski. Sikorski is from Krakow.

In January 2018, Igor Sikorski went to the World Cup in Zagreb, Croatia. He skied really well at the competition.

Neutral Paralympic Athletes at the 2018 Winter Paralympics

Russia sent people to compete at the 2018 Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. They competed as "Neutral Paralympic Athletes" in 5 sports. Only Russian sportspeople that had not participated in doping were allowed to compete. On 26 February 2018, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) said which people from Russia could compete as Neutral Paralympic Athletes at the 2018 Winter Paralympics. The list included 30 people. They were going to compete in para-alpine skiing, para-Nordic skiing, para-snowboarding and wheelchair curling.

Ekaterina Rumyantseva won gold and  Anna Milenina won silver in the women's 6 km biathlon standing race. In the women's 6 km biathlon visually impaired race,  Mikhalina Lysova won gold.  The medals were won on 10 March, the first day of para-Nordic skiing competition at the 2018 Games.

On 26 February 2018, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) said which people from Russia could compete as Neutral Paralympic Athletes at the 2018 Winter Paralympics. The list included 30 people. They were going to compete in para-alpine skiing, para-Nordic skiing, para-snowboarding and wheelchair curling. 10 people are competing in para-alpine skiing, 12 in para-Nordic skiing, 3 in para-snowboarding and 5 in wheelchair curling.  The team also includes 6 guide skiers.  There are also going to be 39 support people and officials. Despite limitations on who can compete because of the doping scandal, Neutral Paralympic Athletes from Russia will be one of the largest delegations at the Games.

The table below contains the list of members of people (called "Team NPA") that will be participating in the 2018 Games.
The following is the list of number of competitors that could participate at the Games per sport/discipline.

After the 2014 Winter Paralympics, the McLaren report said 35 people from Russia had done doping during the Games in Sochi. A decision had been made by mid-2016 that Russia would not be able to compete under the Russian flag at the 2018 Games. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) set conditions for Russia's membership in November 2016. The McLaren Report, printed in December 2016, said more than 1,000 Olympic and Paralympic people had been involved with Russia's government sponsored doping program.

In early January 2017, the Russians asked the ban be removed. They wanted to be able to participate in specific qualifying competitions. In April 2017, a proposal was made to allow Russians to compete using a neutral flag. This was rejected. The IPC explained that people could only use a neutral flag if they were refugees or had no National Paralympic Committee.

In May 2017, the IPC said the Russians had until September 2017 to meet all the conditions if they wanted to go to the Winter Paralympics. If they did not meet the conditions, the Russians probably would not be able to go.

15 National Paralympic Committees and the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation signed a letter expressing support for the National Paralympic Committee of Russia in August 2017.  The countries included Armenia, Belarus, Bulgaria, Vietnam, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Laos, Moldova, Mongolia, Serbia, Tajikistan, Montenegro, and South Korea.  They asked the IPC Governing Board to consider letting Russia compete at the 2018 Winter Paralympics.  The letter was signed weeks before the IPC Governing Board met in Abu Dhabi. In September 2017, this decision was reviewed and upheld. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) still had concerns about doping in Russian sport. All the conditions the IPC required of the Russians were not met.

In October 2017, Russians were allowed to compete in qualifying as Neutral Paralympic Athletes. They were allowed to do this in alpine skiing, biathlon, cross-country skiing and snowboarding. A decision was not made in October about their participation at the 2018 Games.

Because the IPC thought Russia had a doping program run by the government, Russian people were stopped from going to the Games with the Russian flag at the 2018 Games. Some Russian people competed as "Neutral Paralympic Athletes" if the IPC thought they were had not done doping. Because of this, Russians were allowed to compete in 5 sports: para-alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, biathlon, snowboarding and wheelchair curling. Russians were allowed to compete because the IPC thought their National Paralympic Committee had met some of the conditions the IPC had demanded of them. More improvements were still needed though before they could compete at the Paralympics as Russia. Russia's Paralympians currently face more difficult conditions than those of Russia's Olympians. The Government of Russia has said the allegations about doping are not true. They blame the United States, saying it is a conspiracy to make sure they cannot compete. Vladmir Putin said the United States was doing this to try to prevent him from winning the election for President of Russia.

All eligible people from Russia would need additional testing for use of banned substances. The testing would be more than people from other countries would have to do. As of 29 January 2018, the IPC said 30 to 35 Russian sportspeople might be able to go to the Games the way to decide who was going was still taking place. The last date to win a spot at the 2018 Paralympics was 23 February.

The situation mirrors what happened at the 2016 Summer Paralympics, where Russian sportspeople were not allowed to compete using the flag of Russia.

On 28 January 2018, it looked like 14 skiers from Russia could go to South Korea.

The first event on the para-alpine program was the downhill. It starts on 10 March, running from 9:30 AM to 1:30 PM. The second event on the program was Super-G. All skiers raced between 9:30 AM and 1:00 PM on 11 March. The super combined takes place on 13 March. The Super-G part of the event is in the morning. The slalom part is in the afternoon. The slalom event gets underway on 14 March and conclude on 15 March. Women and men both race during the same sessions in the morning. The afternoon sessions start with the women doing their second run. Then the men go.The last para-alpine skiing race of the 2018 Games is the giant slalom. It takes place on 17 - 18 March.  Men and women both race at the same time in the morning sessions.  Women race first in the afternoon sessions, with the men racing a half hour after they end.


On 28 January 2018, it looked like 6 women and 10 men from Russia could go to South Korea. One Russian woman in her early 30s said she intended to compete in Pyeongchang. Vladimir Kiselev said he was not allowed to compete in South Korea. He said he had also been stopped from going to the 2016 Summer Paralympics.

For the 2018 Winter Paralympics, Nord-Trøndelag County Council has some goals. These included getting more people to compete in disability sports. They also wanted to increase the level of accessibility to sports buildings and sports field in Nord-Trøndelag County and the rest of Norway.

In December 2017, Norway said it would not send any anti-doping officials to the Winter Olympics or Paralympics. They are tired of needing to use unpaid volunteers. They think anti-doping officials need to be paid. Anti-doping Norway chief executive Anders Solheim said, "If you sell TV rights for this arrangement for billions of dollars, then we think it's wrong that we pay for Norwegian doping controllers to help with the controls. An inspector should receive a reasonable salary and his trip paid for the three weeks he or she will be there. By not paying doping controllers, the organisers are "de facto" relying on volunteers. Anti-doping work should not be a voluntary profession for those who want to. It is downplaying the priority of our work, and we are tired of it."

Birgit Skarstein competes in two sports: adapted rowing and para-Nordic skiing.  She won a gold medal at the 2017 World Rowing Championships in the PR1 W1x.  Skarstein also went to the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and she finished fourth.  Skarstein has also went to the 2014 Winter Paralympics, competing in para-Nordic skiing.

Lowest common denominator

The lowest common denominator (also least common denominator and LCD) is the least common multiple of the denominators (bottom parts) of a group of fractions. It makes it easier to add, subtract, and compare fractions.

The LCD of formula_1 and formula_2 is 6. This is because formula_1 and formula_2 equal formula_5 and formula_6. 6 is the smallest number that can be at the bottom of both of those fractions.

The same thing also works with variables:

2016 Donald Trump Chicago rally protest

On March 11, 2016, the Donald Trump presidential campaign cancelled a planned rally at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), in Chicago, Illinois, due to "growing safety concerns" due to the protest of thousands of protesters in and outside his rally.

Thousands of anti-Trump protesters responding to civic leaders' and social media calls to shut the rally down had gathered outside the arena, and several hundred more filled seating areas within the UIC Pavilion, where the rally was to take place. When the Trump campaign announced that the rally would not take place, there was a great deal of shouting and a few small fights between Trump supporters and anti-Trump protesters.

Trump blamed Senator Bernie Sanders Sanders for the clashes in Chicago. He said that the protesters were "Bernie's crowd" and that a protester who charged the stage at an event in Dayton, Ohio the following day was a "Bernie person", calling on Sanders to "get your people in line." Sanders later called out Trump as a "pathological liar" who leads a "vicious movement", and said that "while I appreciate that we had supporters at Trump's rally in Chicago, our campaign did not organize the protests."

Korea at the 2018 Winter Paralympics

Korea sent people to compete at the 2018 Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. While North Korea and South Korea compete as separate countries at the 2018 Winter Games, the two countries will enter the stadium during the Opening Ceremonies under one flag. The two countries are still officially at war as the Korean War never officially ended. They had entered the Olympic Games under one flag before, including at the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics and the 2006 Winter Games. Reciprocal military threats made in August and September 2017 by the governments of North Korea and the United States made this possibility at the 2018 Games more complicated.

The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) said North Korea was going to participate in the Winter Games for the first time. The North Koreans will competing under a Korean unification flag like their delegation for the 2018 Winter Olympics did. This is the first time that North Korea went to the Winter Paralympics. The country had gone to the 2012 Summer Paralympics and the 2016 Summer Paralympics. On 1 January 2018, Kim Jong-un said he wanted to have North Koreans competing at the 2018 Winter Olympics and Paralympics. North Koreans had a meeting with the IPC in Lusanne, Switzerland on 20 January 2018. At the meeting, North Korea and South Korea asked the IPC if they could compete as one team. On 27 February, the two countries met at a small village on the border with South Korea. They discussed how the two countries would compete together at the Winter Games. The Government of South Korea thinks the North going to the Games is important. They think it can reduce the tensions between the two countries.

North Korea remains officially at war with South Korea, with the Korean War ending in 1953 with an armistice and not a peace treaty. The two Koreas each claim the territory of the other, and do not recognize each other as legitimate sovereign states. North Korea had nevertheless asked for the right to co-host the Summer Olympics in 1988, when Seoul made their bid to have the Games. Faced with the refusal expressed by the International Olympic Committee, the North boycotted the Games. The country then orchestrated an attack which destroyed Korean Air flight 858, killing one hundred and fifteen people. Despite these problems, at the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics and the 2006 Winter Games, the two Koreas marched together under the banner of Korean unification at the opening ceremony as a sign of reconciliation.

The issue of North Korea's participation in the 2018 Games is complicated by the reciprocal military threats made in August and September 2017 by the governments of North Korea, under the leadership of dictator Kim Jong-un, and the United States, led by President Donald Trump. This included North Korea conducting a nuclear test on September 3 and the firing of North Korean missiles over the territory of Japan. On January 17, following discussions between the two countries in Panmunjeom, it was confirmed that North Korea will participate in the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Pyeongchang.

Ernest P. Worrell

Ernest Powertools Worrell commonly known as Ernest P. Worrell is a fictional character portrayed by the late Jim Varney. Ernest was created by the Nashville advertising agency Carden & Cherry and was used in various local television ad campaigns.

Ernest, almost always dressed in a denim vest and baseball cap, appeared at the door of an unseen and unheard, but seemingly unwilling, next door neighbor named Vern. The spots were structured in a way to allow the viewer to be "Vern" as Varney looked directly at the camera whenever Vern was addressed. Ernest's seemingly pointless conversations with Vern – which were actually a monologue due to Vern never responding – inevitably rambled around to a favorable description of the sponsor's product, followed by his signature close, "KnowhutImean?" While Vern is never shown to ever say anything, it is implied that he finds Ernest to be an unwelcome pest due to him trying to slam his door in Ernest's face on a few occasions. Vern also shakes his head no whenever Ernest invites him to do something. Despite having good intentions, Ernest is utterly oblivious to Vern's apparent distress regarding him and always regards Vern as his closest friend and confidant.

Battle of Hill 60 (Western Front)

Hill 60 was a man-made hill created in the 1860s from what was dug out from a nearby railway line. It had a height of 150 feet and was situated to the south-east of Ypres. It had been captured by the Germans in December 1914, giving them a strategic advantage due to its height.
Naturally the British wanted to take it back and so in April 1915 they began tunnelling. This use of offensive mining involved digging tunnels into and under the hill in order to place 5 mines beneath the hill. When they were detonated they literally blew the top off Hill 60 allowing the British to retake the crucial position.

All the men who joined the Tunnelling Companies were experienced miners; they came from the coal mines in Northumberland, from the sewers in Manchester and the tubes in London. Most of them had been digging since they were 10 years old, with generations of mining history and were often shorter than regular soldiers.
In the barbaric, secret wars below ground; it was these men who experienced one of the highest death rates.

Unfortunately almost as soon as the battle for Hill 60 was finished, the Second Battle of Ypres began. In these significant battles, the Germans used chlorine gas for the first time. And by the end of the battle, the Germans had moved two miles closer to Ypres, on the eastern side of the salient.

Eastern Front (World War II)

The Eastern Front during World War II or the Great Patriotic War was where the Axis countries and the Soviet Union fought. It began in 1941 with Operation Barbarossa and ended in 1945 by the Soviet soldiers capturing Berlin. Both the Axis countries and the Soviet Union had many millions of soldiers, and both sides lost millions.

Romania, Italy and other Axis members joined the war, and Finland fought the Continuation War against the Soviet Union in cooperation with the bigger Axis war.

The Eastern Front is called the "Great Patriotic War" in Russia, and it is sometimes called the "Soviet-German War" in the West. 

About four fifths of the Axis soldiers killed in World War II died on the Eastern Front. Even more millions of Soviet soldiers died. Many war crimes were committed by German troops. The Eastern Front was the most important conflict in Europe during World War II.

The winter of 1941-1942 began unusually early. It was not noted as being particularly bad by the Soviets, but the Germans were accustomed to warmer temperatures and so were ill-prepared. The Germans' equipment broke down in the cold, and some men were still wearing summer uniforms, which they stuffed with newspapers in an attempt to stay warm. Many German soldiers froze to death in the extreme cold.

The partly successful Operation Barbarossa was followed in 1942 by the failed "Fall Blau" (Case Blue), which was intended to take the Caucasus region and its oilfields.

A few years later, the Soviets pushed the German soldiers and invaded the German-occupied territories in Eastern Europe. The Soviets then invaded Germany itself and fought the Battle of Berlin, the final battle before Germany's surrender. Although the Soviets eventually repelled the Germans, the tremendous cost was five times as many Soviet deaths as Germans.

Central business district

This is quite common for European cities such as Paris or Vienna. In cities in the New World a single central area or downtown will often contain most of the metropolitan area's tallest buildings and act both as the CBD and the commercial and cultural city centre. Increasing urbanization in the 21st century has created megacities, particularly in Asia, that will often have multiple CBDs scattered across the urban area.

Paralympic Nordic skiing

Para-Nordic skiing is a type of skiing for people with disabilities. It includes two sports. They are cross country skiing and biathlon. Both sports are for blind people and people with physical disabilities.

Biathlon uses the same rules created by the International Biathlon Association (IBU). Some changes have been made to the rules by the International Paralympic Nordic Skiing Committee (IPNNC).

Biathlon is two sports combined. These sports are shooting and cross country skiing. Biathlon has several types of races. They are 7.5 km, 12.5 km, and pursuit. During the race, people shoot their guns two to four times. Each time they shoot, they take five shots. Depending on the competition, there are two different consequences for missing. They may get a points penalty. They may have to ski a penalty distance.

Blind people and people with physical disabilities compete in the biathlon. People with physical disabilities are separated into two groups. These are standing skiers and sitting skiers.

Blind people use a special electro-acoustic firing system. Their helmets have a wireless connection with their weapons. Using their headphones, they can locate the target. The closer their weapon is aimed at the target, the louder the sound.

The rules for cross country skiing are similar to the ones created by International Ski Federation (FIS). They have been modified by the International Para Nordic Skiing Committee (IPNNC). Blind people and people with physical disabilities compete in cross country skiing. People with physical disabilities are separated into two groups. These are standing skiers and sitting skiers. People with physical disabilities who ski while standing are classified from LW2 to LW9. People with physical disabilities who use a sit ski are classified from LW10 to LW12. People who are blind are classified from B1 to B3. People who are blind use a guide skier. Guide skiers tell a blind skier which direction to ski.

Because people with different types of disabilities ski against each other, a system has been created to make the results more fair. The person with the best time does not always win. Instead, the finishing time is multiplied against a percentage. The percentage is based on how difficult a person's disability makes it to ski. The time multiplied by the percentages gives a new time result. This new time is used to determine who wins a race.

Wheelchair curling

Wheelchair curling is a type of curling. It is for people with physical disabilities.

Curling started to be at the Olympic Games in 1998. Wheelchair curling was introduced to the Winter Paralympics program in 2002. People from 16 countries played wheelchair curling in 2017.

Wheelchair curling is governed by the World Curling Federation. Wheelchair curlers play on teams of four people. One person on the team throws a 19.96 kilogram granite stone across an ice track. The track is 45 meter long. At the end of the track is a big circle. It has 4 rings. The diameter is 183 centimeters. There is a dot in the center. A team tries to get their stones the closest to the center. After each team throws ten stones, the team with the most stones closest to the center wins.

The person who throws the stone sits in their chair on a rubber mat. They use a special stick to assist in throwing the stone.

People who can play wheelchair curling have to have a disability. There are several eligible types of disabilities. They include paraplegics, people with cerebral palsy, people with amputations of the lower limbs, and people with multiple sclerosis.

Para-snowboarding

Para-snowboarding is a type of snowboarding. People with physical disabilities compete in para-snowboarding.

Because people with different types of disability snowboard, people are separated into three groups. In Paralympic sport, these are called classes. The classes are SB-LL1, SB-LL2 and SB-UL.

Mountain pine beetle

Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) is a species of insect pest which lives in the forests of western Canada and the United States. The beetle feeds on the inner bark of pine trees like the lodgepole pine, forming tunnels under the bark to lay their eggs. Normally, the mountain pine beetle prefers to attack sick or old trees because they can't defend themselves easily. However, sometimes the beetles become so numerous that they will group up and start attacking healthy trees in massive outbreaks. This makes the control and monitoring of mountain pine beetle very important for the forest industry in Canada and the U.S., because massive outbreaks of mountain pine beetle can kill entire forests.

Recently, a large outbreak of the beetle in British Columbia became a major problem, killing millions of trees across the province. Due to global warming making it easier for the beetle to survive high in the Canadian Rockies, the beetle was able to spread into Alberta, Canada, where the beetle has never been seen before. Scientists are worried that there is nothing stopping the mountain pine beetle from spreading across the entire continent now.

Arnold Henry Guyot

Arnold Henry Guyot ( ) (September 28, 1807February 8, 1884) was a Swiss-American geologist and geographer. The guyot was named after him.

Guyot was born on September 28, 1807 at Boudevilliers, near Neuchâtel, Switzerland. He schooled at the college of Neuchâtel, Chaux-de-Fonds. In 1825, he traveled to Germany and lived in Karlsruhe where he met Louis Agassiz. From Karlsruhe he moved to Stuttgart, where he studied at the gymnasium. He returned to Neuchâtel in 1827. He determined to enter the ministry and started at the University of Berlin to attend lectures. While in college, he also attended lectures on philosophy and natural science. His leisure time was spent in collecting shells and plants, and he received an entrée to the Berlin Botanical Garden from Humboldt. In 1835, he received the degree of PhD from Berlin.

In 1838, his friend, Agassiz, suggested that he visited the Swiss glaciers. He visited the Swiss glaciers and communicated the results of his six-week investigation to the Geological Society of France. He was the first to point out certain important observations relating to glacial motion and structure. He also noted the more rapid flow of the center than of the sides, and the more rapid flow of the top than of the bottom of glaciers; described the laminated or ribboned structure of the glacial ice; and ascribed the movement of glaciers to a gradual molecular displacement rather than to a sliding of the ice mass as held by de Saussure. He also went on to collect important data concerning erratic boulders.

In 1839, he became the colleague of Agassiz as professor of history and physical geography at the College of Neuchâtel (a.k.a. Neuchâtel Academy). When the institution got suspended in 1848, Guyot travelled to the United States, where he settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He delivered lectures for a course at the Lowell Institute which were later published as "Earth and Man" (Boston 1849). For several years the Massachusetts Board of Education employed him as a lecturer on geography and methods of instruction to the normal schools and teachers' institutes.

He was occupied with this work until in 1854, when he was appointed professor of physical geography and geology at Princeton University. This was his office until his death. He was also for several years lecturer on physical geography in the State Normal School in Trenton, New Jersey, and from 1861 to 1866 lecturer in the Princeton Theological Seminary. He also gave courses in the Union Theological Seminary, New York, and at Columbia College. He founded the museum at Princeton, many of the specimens of which are from his own collections.

His scientific work in the United States included the perfection of plans for a national system of meteorological observations. Most of these were conducted under the Smithsonian Institution. His extensive meteorological observations led to the establishment of the United States Weather Bureau, and his "Meteorological and Physical Tables" (1852, revised ed. 1884) were long standard.
A guyot, also known as a tablemount, is an isolated underwater volcanic mountain (seamount), with a flat top over 200 metres (660 feet) below the surface of the sea. The diameters of these flat summits can be more than . The term "guyot" was coined by Harry Hammond Hess and named after Arnold Guyot.

Guyot rejected Darwin's theory of human evolution and, at the same time, he accepted Hugh Miller's views on the book of Genesis, thinking that the days described there might have taken a longer period of time. Scientist James Dwight Dana described Guyot as "a fervently religious man, living as if ever in communion with his Heavenly Parent; a Christian, following closely in the footsteps of his Master."

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (released in the United States and India as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) is a 2001 fantasy movie directed by Chris Columbus and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, based on 1997 novel of the same name.

One night, Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall, professors at Hogwarts, with Rubeus Hagrid deliver orphaned infant named Harry Potter to his remaining relatives, the Dursleys. 

Ten years later, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) begins receiving strange letters by owls. He and the Dursleys escape to an island from intrusive letters. There appears Hagrid and informs Harry that he is wizard and his parents were wizards too. Harry has been accepted into Hogwarts, a school where young witches and wizards are taught magic. 

Hagrid also tells Harry that his parents were killed by an evil wizard called Lord Voldemort when he was just a baby. Because Harry's mother let herself die to protect Harry, Voldemort could not kill Harry and died instead. Harry is well-known as "The Boy Who Lived". 

Harry enters King's Cross station to board a train to Hogwarts, where he meets Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). After arriving at school the students gather in the Great Hall, where the first-years are sorted by the Sorting Hat among four houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff. Harry is placed into Gryffindor despite the fact that the Sorting Hat offers him Slytherin, where Voldemort studied. 

At Hogwarts, Harry begins learning magical spells, plays Quidditch. One night the stair cases change paths leading Harry, Ron and Hermione to the forbidden floor of Hogwarts. There is a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy which guards the Philosopher's Stone, as it turns out later. Harry suspects that the Potions teacher Severus Snape is trying to obtain the stone to return Voldemort to physical form. 

One day Hagrid reveals to Harry, Ron and Hermione that Fluffy will fall asleep if the music is played to him. The trio decide to find the stone before Snape does. They discover an already asleep Fluffy and face a series of obstacles before Harry find the stone. 

After getting past the tasks, Harry find out that it is the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Quirrell, who is trying to claim the stone. Snape had been protecting Harry all along. Quirrell removes his turban and reveals that Voldemort's face is living on the back of his head. Harry manages to get the Philosopher's Stone by looking into a magic mirror. Voldemort/Quirrell tries to kill Harry but because Harry is still protected by his dead mother's love, Quirrell cannot touch Harry and he turns to dust. Voldemort's soul escapes. 

Harry recovers in the school's hospital wing. The headmaster, Professor Dumbledore explains him that the stone is destroyed and his friends are safe. He also reveals the cause of defeat Quirrell by Harry: because of his mother Harry has love-based protection from Voldemort. 

Harry, Ron and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances. Harry returns home for the summer, happy to finally have a real home in Hogwarts.

Apollo command and service module

The Apollo command and service module (CSM) was one of two spacecraft, along with the Lunar Module, used for the United States Apollo program which landed astronauts on the Moon. It was built for NASA by North American Aviation. It was launched by itself on three suborbital and low Earth orbit Apollo test missions using the Saturn I launch vehicle. It was also launched twelve times on the larger Saturn V launch vehicle, both by itself and with the Lunar Module. It made a total of nine manned flights to the Moon boosted by the Saturn V.

AS-202

AS-202 (also referred to as SA-202) was the second uncrewed, suborbital test flight of a production Block I Apollo command and service module launched with the Saturn IB launch vehicle. It was launched on August 25, 1966, and was the first flight which included the spacecraft guidance and navigation control system and fuel cells. The success of this flight enabled the Apollo program to judge the Block I spacecraft and Saturn IB ready to carry men into orbit on the next mission, AS-204.

AS-202 was the third test flight of the Saturn IB engine, because a delay in the readiness of the Apollo spacecraft 011 pushed its launch past the July 1966 launch of AS-203. It was designed to test the rocket more than had been done on AS-201 by launching the rocket higher and having the flight lasting twice as long. It would also test the command and service module (CSM-011) by having the engine fire four times during the flight.

The flight was also designed to test the heat shield by subjecting it to intense heat during reentry. Over the course of the reentry it generated equivalent energy needed to power Los Angeles for over one minute in 1966.

CSM-011 was basically a production model capable of carrying a crew. However it lacked the crew couches and some displays that would be included on later missions for the astronauts. This was the first flight of the guidance and navigation system as well as the fuel cell electrical system.

Cutoff frequency

The cutoff frequency is the minimum frequency that is required for the emission of electrons from a metallic surface, due to incident radiation. Below the cutoff frequency, the phenomenon of the photoelectric effect stops altogether.

When electromagnetic radiation is incident upon a metallic surface, if the radiation has a frequency greater than the threshold frequency, a part of the energy of the incident radiation (known as threshold work function) is absorbed by the electrons on the metallic surface; facilitating electronic excitement. The remaining portion (i.e, energy of incident radiation - threshold work function) is transformed into the kinetic energy of the electrons and accounts for their ejection.

Anchiceratops

Anchiceratops was a kind of plant-eating dinosaur. It had a long frill on the back of its head and three horns on its face. There were two long ones above its eyes and one shorter one on its nose. It was similar to "Triceratops", which also had these features. "Anchiceratops" was found in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, which is a fossil site in Alberta. There is just one species of "Anchiceratops", "A. ornatus".

Barnum Brown found the first "Anchiceratops" skulls in 1912. He gave them their name, "Anchiceratops ornatus", in 1914, two years later. "Anchiceratops" means "almost "Ceratops"" and "ornatus" means "ornate". In 1924, C. M. Sternberg discovered another skull. It was smaller and had a long beak. In 1929, he named this species "A. longirostris", meaning "long snout." However, in 1990, Leham decided that "A. longirostris" was only the female of "A. ornatus". Another study done by Dodson and Currie in the same year agreed with this idea. In 1925, Sternberg found a headless skeleton that he thought belonged to "Anchiceratops". However, it could belong to "Arrhinoceratops" or a new genus. Other skulls have been found but they have never been described.

"Anchiceratops" could be 4.5 meters (15 feet) long and 1.5 tonnes (1.65 tons) in weight. If the unnamed skeleton belonged to "Anchiceratops", then it would only be 4.3 meters (14 feet) and weigh just 1.2 tonnes (1.32 tons).

"Anchiceratops" had a short nose horn that went forwards. The horns above its eyes (brow horns) were long and went a bit to the side. They were slightly curved. The frill was narrow and had many small hornlets on its outside edge. It did not angle upwards very far. The snout on some specimens is very long.

The skeleton that may belong to this dinosaur was strange. It was smaller than in most other ceratopsids. It had a long neck and strong arms, but it had a short tail with only 38 vertebrae instead of 45. The length of its thighbone was 74 centimeters and its shin was 51.5 centimeters long.

"Anchiceratops" was classified like this by Scott Sampson in 2010. This family tree shows many related ceratopsids.

"Anchiceratops" lived in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. "Arrhinoceratops" and one other ceratopsid may also have lived there. When "Anchiceratops" was alive the Horseshoe Canyon Formation was a floodplain with forests. "Anchiceratops" seems to have liked marshy places, unlike other ceratopsids that liked drier locations.

Most of the songs were new, though Cohen did debut "Born in Chains" onstage in 2010 and "My Oh My" was played during a soundcheck the same year.

Upon its release the album received uniformly positive reviews from critics. "The New York Times" gave a moderately positive review, calling Cohen "one of rock’s most profound aphorists".

The album peaked at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 20,000 copies in its first week.

You Want It Darker (song)

"You Want It Darker" is a single by Canadian poet and musician Leonard Cohen. It was released on October 21, 2016, three weeks before Cohen's death. The song is the title track from Cohen's album "You Want It Darker". 

It earned Cohen a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance.

Various Positions

Various Positions is the seventh studio album by Leonard Cohen, It was released in December 1984 (and February 1985). It marked not only his turn to the modern sound, but also, after the harmonies and backing vocals from Jennifer Warnes on the previous "Recent Songs" (1979). The album included Cohen's best known work "Hallelujah". 

"Various Positions" made the top ten in Spain, Portugal, and Scandinavia, and fared modestly well in the United Kingdom. In the original 1985 "Rolling Stone" review, Don Shewey complimented Lissauer's "lucid and beautiful production".

Dance Me to the End of Love

"Dance Me to the End of Love" is a 1984 song by Leonard Cohen. It was first performed by Cohen on his 1984 album "Various Positions". It has been recorded by many artists and in 2009 was described as "trembling on the brink of becoming a standard." The song has many references to Greek gods.

I'm Your Man (Leonard Cohen song)

"I'm Your Man" is a song written by Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, first released on the album of the same name. Originally released as a single in 1988, it reached number 57 in the French charts after Cohen's death in 2016. "Everybody Knows" was first released on Cohen's album "I'm Your Man", February 1988.

Rolling Stone said, "Set to a cheesy drum-machine beat and sotto voce horn riffs, with more than a little suggestion of a country ballad, Cohen conversationally throws himself at the feet of a woman he's done wrong. He'd never beg for her forgiveness, of course. But if he did: 'I'd crawl to you baby and I'd fall at your feet/And I'd howl at your beauty like a dog in heat...'"

I'm Your Man (Leonard Cohen album)

I'm Your Man is the eighth studio album by Leonard Cohen, released in 1988. The album marked Cohen's further move to a more modern sound.

"I'm Your Man" was recorded in Los Angeles and Montreal and employed four producers: Roscoe Beck, Jean-Michel Reusser, Michel Robidoux, and Cohen himself.

The album includes some of the singer's most popular songs and concert staples, including the single "Ain't No Cure for Love", "First We Take Manhattan", "Tower of Song", and "Everybody Knows", which was a collaboration with Cohen's backup singer Sharon Robinson.

First We Take Manhattan

"First We Take Manhattan" is a song written by Leonard Cohen. It was originally recorded by Jennifer Warnes on her 1986 Cohen tribute album "Famous Blue Raincoat", which consisted entirely of songs written or co-written by Cohen.

Ben Hewitt writing for "The Guardian" in 2015 drew attention to the lyric's apocalyptic nature, imagining Cohen "greedily eyeing world domination like a Bond villain".

Joe Cocker covered "First We Take Manhattan" on his 1999 album "No Ordinary World".

Cohen explained himself in a backstage interview: "I think it means exactly what it says. It is a terrorist song. I think it's a response to terrorism. There's something about terrorism that I've always admired. The fact that there are no alibis or no compromises. That position is always very attractive. I don't like it when it's manifested on the physical plane – I don't really enjoy the terrorist activities – but Psychic Terrorism. I remember there was a great poem by Irving Layton that I once read, I'll give you a paraphrase of it. It was 'well, you guys blow up an occasional airline and kill a few children here and there', he says. 'But our terrorists, Jesus, Freud, Marx, Einstein. The whole world is still quaking.'"

The Future (Leonard Cohen album)

The Future is the ninth studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, released in 1992. Political events and history are found elsewhere on the album, with Cohen making references to Tiananmen Square, Stalin, World War II and Hiroshima.

The title track was originally called "If You Could See What's Coming Next", and underwent extensive rewrites, taking up almost sixty pages in Cohen's notebook, while "Closing Time" took two years with Cohen even starting over from scratch on the song as late as March 1992.

Suzanne (Leonard Cohen song)

"Suzanne" is a song written by Canadian poet and musician Leonard Cohen in 1968. First published as a poem in 1966, it was recorded as a song by Judy Collins in the same year. Cohen performed it as his debut single, from his 1967 album "Songs of Leonard Cohen". 

In 2006, Pitchfork Media listed the song #41 on their list of "The Top Songs of the 1960s".

So Long, Marianne

"So Long, Marianne" is a 1967 song written by Canadian poet and musician Leonard Cohen. It was featured on his debut album, "Songs of Leonard Cohen". Pitchfork Media placed it at number 190 on their list of "The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s."

Songs of Leonard Cohen

Songs of Leonard Cohen is the debut album by Canadian folk singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen. It was released on December 27, 1967 on Columbia Records. The best known song from the album is "So Long, Marianne".

"Songs of Leonard Cohen" foreshadowed the kind of chart success Cohen would go on to achieve. It reached number 83 on the "Billboard" 200 and achieving gold status in the US only in 1989, but peaked at number 13 on the UK Albums Chart, and spent nearly a year and a half on it.

Take This Waltz (song)

"Take This Waltz" is a song by Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen. It was originally released as part of the 1986 Federico García Lorca tribute album "Poet in New York" ("Poeta en Nueva York") and as a single.

The song was later included in Cohen's 1988 studio album "I'm Your Man". The song's lyrics are a loose translation, into English, of the poem "Pequeño vals vienés" (Little Viennese Waltz) by the Spanish poet Federico García Lorca (one of Cohen's favorite poets). The poem was first published in Lorca's seminal book "Poeta en Nueva York". 

The song reached number one in Spain in 1986.

Pan-Africanism

Pan-Africanism is a political movement about improving the position of Africa, and people with ancestors from Africa in the world. In essence, Pan-Africanism is the belief that people of African descent have common interests and should be unified. Pan-Africanists believe the slave trade and colonialism have hurt African nations and people, and the solution that they see is for Africans to unite politically.

Diomedes

Diomedes (, "Diomēdēs" - "God-like cunning, advised by Zeus") was an ancient Greek hero and one of the central figures of the "Iliad". Son of King Tydeus and Queen Deipyle, he was the leader of the Argive contingent during the Trojan War. Diomedes was, alongside Greater Ajax, regarded as one of the greatest of all the Achaean warriors, second only to Achilles in terms of prowess.

Hexadecagon

An hexadecagon or hexakaidecagon is a shape with 16 sides and 16 corners.

A "regular hexadecagon" is a hexadecagon in which all angles are equal and all sides are congruent. Its Schläfli symbol is {16} and can be constructed as a truncated octagon, t{8}, and a twice-truncated square tt{4}. A truncated hexadecagon, t{16}, is a triacontadigon, {32}.

The area of a regular hexadecagon with edge length "t" is

Because the hexadecagon has a number of sides that is a power of two, its area can be computed in terms of the circumradius "R" by truncating Viète's formula:

Since the area of the circumcircle is formula_3 the regular hexadecagon fills approximately 97.45% of its circumcircle.

Coxeter states that every parallel-sided 2"m"-gon can be divided into m(m-1)/2 rhombs. For the "regular hexadecagon", "m"=8, and it can be divided into 28: 4 squares and 3 sets of 8 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 8-cube, with 28 of 1792 faces. The list A006245 enumerates the number of solutions as 1232944, including up to 16-fold rotations and chiral forms in reflection.

A skew hexadecagon is a skew polygon with 24 vertices and edges but not existing on the same plane. The interior of such an hexadecagon is not generally defined. A "skew zig-zag hexadecagon" has vertices alternating between two parallel planes.

A regular skew hexadecagon is vertex-transitive with equal edge lengths. In 3-dimensions it will be a zig-zag skew hexadecagon and can be seen in the vertices and side edges of a octagonal antiprism with the same D, [2,16] symmetry, order 32. The octagrammic antiprism, s{2,16/3} and octagrammic crossed-antiprism, s{2,16/5} also have regular skew octagons.

In the early 16th century, Raphael was the first to construct a perspective image of a regular hexadecagon: the tower in his painting "The Marriage of the Virgin" has 16 sides, elaborating on an eight-sided tower in a previous painting by Pietro Perugino.
Hexadecagrams (16-sided star polygons) are included in the Girih patterns in the Alhambra.
An octagonal star can be seen as a concave hexadecagon:

Parallelepiped

In geometry, a parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure formed by six parallelograms (the term rhomboid is also sometimes used with this meaning). By analogy, it relates to a parallelogram just as a cube relates to a square or as a cuboid to a rectangle. In Euclidean geometry, its definition encompasses all four concepts (i.e., "parallelepiped", "parallelogram", "cube", and "square"). In this context of affine geometry, in which angles are not differentiated, its definition admits only "parallelograms" and "parallelepipeds". Three equivalent definitions of "parallelepiped" are
The rectangular cuboid (six rectangular faces), cube (six square faces), and the rhombohedron (six rhombus faces) are all specific cases of parallelepiped.

Any of the three pairs of parallel faces can be viewed as the base planes of the prism. A parallelepiped has three sets of four parallel edges; the edges within each set are of equal length.

Parallelepipeds result from linear transformations of a cube (for the non-degenerate cases: the bijective linear transformations).

Since each face has point symmetry, a parallelepiped is a zonohedron. Also the whole parallelepiped has point symmetry "C" (see also triclinic). Each face is, seen from the outside, the mirror image of the opposite face. The faces are in general chiral, but the parallelepiped is not.

A space-filling tessellation is possible with congruent copies of any parallelepiped.

The volume of a parallelepiped is the product of the area of its base "A" and its height "h". The base is any of the six faces of the parallelepiped. The height is the perpendicular distance between the base and the opposite face.

An alternative method defines the vectors a = ("a", "a", "a"), b = ("b", "b", "b") and c = ("c", "c", "c") to represent three edges that meet at one vertex. The volume of the parallelepiped then equals the absolute value of the scalar triple product a · (b × c):

This is true because, if we choose b and c to represent the edges of the base, the area of the base is, by definition of the cross product (see geometric meaning of cross product),
where "θ" is the angle between b and c, and the height is 
where "α" is the internal angle between a and "h".

From the figure, we can deduce that the magnitude of α is limited to 0° ≤ "α" < 90°. On the contrary, the vector b × c may form with a an internal angle "β" larger than 90° (0° ≤ "β" ≤ 180°). Namely, since b × c is parallel to "h", the value of "β" is either "β" = "α" or "β" = 180° − "α". So 
and 
We conclude that 
which is, by definition of the scalar (or dot) product, equivalent to the absolute value of a · (b × c), Q.E.D.

The latter expression is also equivalent to the absolute value of the determinant of a three dimensional matrix built using a, b and c as rows (or columns):
This is found using Cramer's Rule on three reduced two dimensional matrices found from the original.

If "a", "b", and "c" are the parallelepiped edge lengths, and α, β, and γ are the internal angles between the edges, the volume is

The volume of any tetrahedron that shares three converging edges of a parallelepiped has a volume equal to one sixth of the volume of that parallelepiped (see proof).

For parallelepipeds with a symmetry plane there are two cases:
See also monoclinic.

A rectangular cuboid, also called a "rectangular parallelepiped" or sometimes simply a "cuboid", is a parallelepiped of which all faces are rectangular; a cube is a cuboid with square faces.

A rhombohedron is a parallelepiped with all rhombic faces; a trigonal trapezohedron is a rhombohedron with congruent rhombic faces.

A "perfect parallelepiped" is a parallelepiped with integer-length edges, face diagonals, and space diagonals. In 2009, dozens of perfect parallelepipeds were shown to exist, answering an open question of Richard Guy. One example has edges 271, 106, and 103, minor face diagonals 101, 266, and 255, major face diagonals 183, 312, and 323, and space diagonals 374, 300, 278, and 272. 

Some perfect parallelopipeds having two rectangular faces are known. But it is not known whether there exist any with all faces rectangular; such a case would be called a perfect cuboid.

Coxeter called the generalization of a parallelepiped in higher dimensions a parallelotope.

Specifically in "n"-dimensional space it is called "n"-dimensional parallelotope, or simply "n"-parallelotope. Thus a parallelogram is a 2-parallelotope and a parallelepiped is a 3-parallelotope.

More generally a parallelotope, or "voronoi parallelotope", has parallel and congruent opposite facets. So a 2-parallelotope is a parallelogon which can also include certain hexagons, and a 3-parallelotope is a parallelohedron, including 5 types of polyhedra.

The diagonals of an "n"-parallelotope intersect at one point and are bisected by this point. Inversion in this point leaves the "n"-parallelotope unchanged. See also fixed points of isometry groups in Euclidean space.

The edges radiating from one vertex of a "k"-parallelotope form a "k"-frame formula_9 of the vector space, and the parallelotope can be recovered from these vectors, by taking linear combinations of the vectors, with weights between 0 and 1.

The "n"-volume of an "n"-parallelotope embedded in formula_10 where formula_11 can be computed by means of the Gram determinant. Alternatively, the volume is the norm of the exterior product of the vectors:

If "m" = "n", this amounts to the absolute value of the determinant of the "n" vectors.

Another formula to compute the volume of an "n"-parallelotope "P" in formula_13, whose vertices are formula_14, is 

where formula_16 is the row vector formed by the concatenation of formula_17 and 1. Indeed, the determinant is unchanged if formula_18 is subtracted from formula_16 (), and placing formula_18 in the last position only changes its sign. 

Similarly, the volume of any "n"-simplex that shares "n" converging edges of a parallelotope has a volume equal to one 1/"n"! of the volume of that parallelotope.

The word appears as "parallelipipedon" in Sir Henry Billingsley's translation of Euclid's Elements, dated 1570. In the 1644 edition of his "Cursus mathematicus", Pierre Hérigone used the spelling "parallelepipedum". The "Oxford English Dictionary" cites the present-day "parallelepiped" as first appearing in Walter Charleton's "Chorea gigantum" (1663).

Charles Hutton's Dictionary (1795) shows "parallelopiped" and "parallelopipedon", showing the influence of the combining form "parallelo-", as if the second element were "pipedon" rather than "epipedon". Noah Webster (1806) includes the spelling "parallelopiped". The 1989 edition of the "Oxford English Dictionary" describes "parallelopiped" (and "parallelipiped") explicitly as incorrect forms, but these are listed without comment in the 2004 edition, and only pronunciations with the emphasis on the fifth syllable "pi" () are given.

A change away from the traditional pronunciation has hidden the different partition suggested by the Greek roots, with "epi-" ("on") and "pedon" ("ground") combining to give "epiped", a flat "plane". Thus the faces of a parallelepiped are planar, with opposite faces being parallel.

Pentacontagon

In geometry, a pentacontagon or pentecontagon or 50-gon is a fifty-sided polygon. The sum of any pentacontagon's interior angles is 8640 degrees.

A "regular pentacontagon" is represented by Schläfli symbol {50} and can be constructed as a quasiregular truncated icosipentagon, t{25}, which alternates two types of edges.

One interior angle in a regular pentacontagon is 172°, meaning that one exterior angle would be 7°.

The area of a regular pentacontagon is (with )

and its inradius is

The circumradius of a regular pentacontagon is

Since 50 = 2 × 5, a regular pentacontagon is not constructible using a compass and straightedge, and is not constructible even if the use of an angle trisector is allowed.

Coxeter states that every zonogon (a 2"m"-gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into "m"("m"-1)/2 parallelograms.
In particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi. For the "regular pentacontagon", "m"=25, it can be divided into 300: 12 sets of 25 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 25-cube.


Hexacontagon

A hexacontagon or 60-gon is a shape with 60 sides and 60 corners.

A "regular hexacontagon" is represented by Schläfli symbol {60} and also can be constructed as a truncated triacontagon, t{30}, or a twice-truncated pentadecagon, tt{15}. A truncated hexacontagon, t{60}, is a 120-gon, {120}.

One interior angle in a regular hexacontagon is 174°, meaning that one exterior angle would be 6°.

The area of a regular hexacontagon is (with )

and its inradius is

The circumradius of a regular hexacontagon is

This means that the trigonometric functions of π/60 can be expressed in radicals.

Since 60 = 2 × 3 × 5, a regular hexacontagon is constructible using a compass and straightedge. As a truncated triacontagon, it can be constructed by an edge-bisection of a regular triacontagon.

Coxeter states that every zonogon (a 2"m"-gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into "m"("m"-1)/2 parallelograms.

In particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi. For the "regular hexacontagon", "m"=30, and it can be divided into 435: 15 squares and 14 sets of 30 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 30-cube.

Government of India Act 1858

The Government of India Act 1858 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (21 & 22 Vict. c. 106) passed on August 2, 1858. Its provisions called for the liquidation of the British East India Company (who had up to this point been ruling British India under the auspices of Parliament) and the transference of its functions to the British Crown.

The Act ushered in a new period of Indian history, bringing about the end of Company rule in India. The era of the new British Raj would last until Partition of British India in August 1947, at which time all of the territory of the British Raj was granted Dominion status within the Dominion of Pakistan and the Dominion of India.

Indian Independence Act 1947

The Indian Independence Act 1947 (1947 c. 30 (10 & 11. Geo. 6.)) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that partitioned British India into the two new Independent Dominions of India and Pakistan. The Act received the royal assent on 18 July 1947, and Pakistan came into being on 14 August and India came into being on 15 August.

There was much violence, and many Muslims from what would become India fled to Pakistan; and Hindus and Sikhs from what would become Pakistan fled to India. Many people left behind all their possessions and property to avoid the violence and flee to their new country.

The Indian Independence Act was subsequently repealed in Article 395 of the Constitution of India and in Article 221 of the Constitution of Pakistan of 1956, both constitutions being intended to bring about greater independence for the new states. Although the new constitutions did not have the legal authority to repeal the Act, the repeal was intended to establish them as independent legal systems based only on home-grown legislation. The Act has not been repealed in the United Kingdom, where it still has effect, although some sections of it have been repealed.

Isosceles triangle

In geometry, an isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two sides of equal length. Sometimes it is specified as having two "and only two" sides of equal length, and sometimes as having "at least" two sides of equal length, the latter version thus including the equilateral triangle as a special case.
Examples of isosceles triangles include the isosceles right triangle, the golden triangle, and the faces of bipyramids and certain Catalan solids.

The mathematical study of isosceles triangles dates back to ancient Egyptian mathematics and Babylonian mathematics. Isosceles triangles have been used as decoration from even earlier times, and appear frequently in architecture and design, for instance in the pediments and gables of buildings.

The two equal sides are called the legs and the third side is called the base of the triangle. The other dimensions of the triangle, such as its height, area, and perimeter, can be calculated by simple formulas from the lengths of the legs and base.
Every isosceles triangle has an axis of symmetry along the perpendicular bisector of its base. The two angles opposite the legs are equal and are always acute, so the classification of the triangle as acute, right, or obtuse depends only on the angle between its two legs.

The national flag of Nepal () was created in December 1962. It is the only national flag in the world that doesn't have four sides.

The current flag was adopted on 16 December 1962, along with the formation of a new constitutional government. It borrows from the original, traditional design, used throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and is a combination of the two individual flags used by rival branches of the ruling dynasty.

It has a combination of two red pennants with the large blue border around the unique shape of two overlapping right triangles: the smaller upper triangle bears the white stylised moon (the rising sun on the horizontal crescent moon) and the larger lower triangle displays the white twelve-pointed sun.

Because of the Nepalese flag's unique shape, its large-scale reproduction is difficult. It is sometimes put on a white area to make the flag a rectangle; an example is the Nepalese flag used at some venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics where the flag design was placed on a cloth with the same shape as other flags at the Olympics, with the rest of the flag left white.

During a visit of the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Janakpur, a version of the flag with incorrect shape was flown by officials, causing controversy.

Nephritis is inflammation of the kidneys. It may involve the glomeruli, tubules, or interstitial tissue surrounding the glomeruli and tubules.

Nephritis is often caused by infections, and toxins, but is most commonly caused by autoimmune disorders that affect the major organs like kidneys.

This can lead to reduced glomerular blood flow, leading to reduced urine output (oliguria) and retention of waste products (uremia). As a result, red blood cells may leak out of damaged glomeruli, causing blood to appear in the urine (hematuria).

Because they are a hybrid dog from two purebreds, they are known to have hybrid vigor (extra strength and health).

Zuchons love to spend time with their master and therefore it is not uncommon for them to suffer from separation anxiety which can be troublesome when they are left alone. They are better behaved and less stressed when they are kept company.

False titles of nobility

False titles of nobility are titles of nobility which are fake. They have been invented or taken by a person or family. They are not recognised by the present or past government of the country. 

There are a number of schemes that pretend to confer or sell such titles. They have flourished by use of the internet. 

In monarchies, genuine titles do exist. But they may no longer be recognised by a successor state (such as a republic). Such is the case with French titles, for example. Formerly noble families often still use their old titles, and this is generally acceptable in that society. The title is borne or claimed by a hereditary heir. That is different from an invented or falsely-attributed noble title which is claimed without any historic basis.

Self-assumption of a title is not necessarily illegal. It depends on the law in the particular country. The bearers of some self-assumed titles do not claim that the titles have been recognized by any nation at any time. 

Some individuals, associations or companies pretend to give a legal or official right to a title, to an individual or family. Naturally, this requires a remittance or donation, and hence the transaction may be illegal. Also, pretending to be a titled person with intent to deceive also may be an offence.

2017–2018 North Korea crisis

In 2017, a crisis began when North Korea threatened the United States with a nuclear weapon. They began testing missiles, which proved that North Korea could attack the United States with a missile.

North Korea also threatened Australia with a nuclear weapon, saying that they were following the United States for no reason.

By 2018, the crisis had slowed down after North Korea went into talks with South Korea. They also agreed to take part in the 2018 Winter Olympics under one team for both Koreas. North Korea then began to stop doing nuclear tests. In September 2018, a summit between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump happened in Singapore. North Korea agreed to stop making nuclear weapons.

Two other summits happened in 2019, but these did not go well and broke down.

Ultra

Ultra was the name given by British military intelligence for the attack on German military codes in World War II. It included the Enigma machine and, later, the Japanese Purple machine.

The work on Enigma started before the war, when Polish cryptographers smuggled out an Enigma machine to England. The codename 'Ultra', however, was only given to the work in 1941.

Work on understanding the Enigma, and on breaking German military signals, was of vital importance in the Battle of the Atlantic, the greatest threat to Britain during the war. The key event occurred in 1941, when not just a machine, but also a codebook, was got from a German submarine.

Wartime signals intelligence (SIGINT) were got as follows. First of all, encrypted German radio messages in Morse code were recorded in Britain. Their place of origin was got by recording the messages at two different receiving places. The attack on the codes was done at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park.

Ultra became the standard term among the western Allies for all such intelligence. The name arose because the intelligence got was thought more important than the highest British security classification ("Most Secret").

Eleusinian Mysteries

The Eleusinian Mysteries () were a series of initiations held every year in honor of the Greek goddesses Demeter and Persephone. They were held at or near the city of Eleusis. They are the "most famous of the secret religious rites of Ancient Greece". Some think the power of the Eleusinian Mysteries came from drinking a psychedelic potion called "kykeon". 

The mysteries were about the myth of the abduction of Persephone from her mother Demeter by Hades, the god of the underworld. This myth had a cycle of three phases: the "descent" (loss), the "search", and the "ascent". The main theme was the "ascent" (άνοδος) of Persephone to the mortal realm and her reunion with her mother. 

Those who took part in these mysteries were sworn to secrecy. Initiates were promised a reward in the afterlife. It was a major festival of the Hellenic era, and later spread to Rome. Similar religious rites appear in the agricultural societies of the Near East and in Minoan Crete.

Charles VIII of France

Charles VIII of France (June 30, 1470 – April 7, 1498) was the King of France and Charlotte of Savoy. He was the son of Louis XI. He was born on June 30, 1470 in the Chateau d'Amboise, France.

Charles became King when aged 13. Because Charles was a minor, his older sister Anne acted as his regent, until he was 21-years-old. 

In 1488, Anne, Duchess of Brittany was chosen to be Charles's wife. Anne, who was a wealthy, independent ruler had already agreed to marry Maximillian, the heir to the Austrian throne. To prevent the marriage, France invaded Brittany, and forced Anne to change her mind. Charles and Anne were married in December 1491.

As a king he was both militarily successful and diplomatically clever, and between 1494 and 1498 he completed an invasion of Italy without much opposition. 

Although the young king was active and healthy, his children with Anne were not, and all died in infancy. So, when Charles died in an accident in April 1498, his cousin Louis succeeded him as Louis XII.

Earwax

Earwax is a sticky yellow or grey substance like wax produced by the ears. The earwax sticks to dust that gets in the ears to keep them clean. It also protects the skin of ear and protects ear from insects, water, fungi and bacteria. Some people try to remove earwax, which may damage the eardrum. The movement of jaws helps to clean the earwax naturally.

Primary progressive aphasia

Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a type of neurological syndrome and rare type of dementia in which language capabilities slowly and progressively get worse. 

The symptoms of PPA depend on what parts of the left cerebral hemisphere are damaged.

Neurological disorder

A neurological disorder is any disorder of the nervous system. Structural, biochemical or electrical abnormalities in the brain, spinal cord or other nerves can result in a range of symptoms. 

Examples of symptoms include paralysis, muscle weakness, poor coordination, loss of sensation, seizures, confusion, pain and altered levels of consciousness. Many neurological conditions cannot be cured. Some can be prevented

Conditions such as stroke, dementia and migraine are the biggest global cause of ill-health. 3.4 billion people suffered a nervous system condition in 2021. The number of disability-adjusted life years due to neurological problems from 375 million in 1990 to 443 million in 2021. That is because the population has increased and people are living longer. The problems are much worse in poorer countries.

Raymond Specht

Raymond Louis Specht (July 19, 1924 – February 13, 2021) was an Australian plant ecologist, conservationist and academic, who participated in the Arnhem Land Scientific Expedition of 1948.

Raymond Louis Specht was born in 1924 in Adelaide, South Australia to Louis and Harriet Specht. He attended Richmond Primary School and Adelaide High School, finishing high school as dux in 1941. Specht intended to pursue teaching as a career. In 1942 he was a student teacher in physics, chemistry and mathematics at Riverton High School. After attending a short course in teaching at the University of Adelaide, he enrolled in Adelaide Teachers College studying biology in 1943. He combined this with studies at the University of Adelaide, and ultimately took his BSc in botany and zoology in 1945 before taking first class honours in plant ecology in 1946.

Specht was invited to join the National Geographic Society and Smithsonian Institution sponsored Arnhem Land Scientific Expedition in 1946. After completing his Honours project he and the 15 other members of the group set out from Adelaide in March 1948. As the botanist for the group, Specht would spend 8 months with the team, collecting 25 tonnes of specimens. After the expedition ended, Specht and his specimens flew to Brisbane in 1949 where the collected materials were identified and prepared for distribution around the world. Materials were sent to six herbaria within Australia, to Kew in England, the Rijksmuseum in Leiden, the Smithsonian Institution and Arnold Arboretum in the U.S.

Specht returned to Adelaide and worked steadily on recording the materials recovered from the expedition over the next 14 years. The results of this would become Volume 3 of the Expedition, Botany and plant ecology (1958), co-edited with Charles P. Mountford. He also edited Volume 4 entitled Zoology (1964).

Specht worked as a senior research fellow at the University of Adelaide from 1950 while he worked on his MSc. He was appointed a lecturer in botany in 1951, and worked on his PhD for the next two years, on mineral nutrition and biomass relationships of the heath vegetation at Dark Island, South Australia. He rose to Senior Lecturer in 1955. In 1956, Specht earnt Fulbright, Smith Mundt and Carnegie grants to study in the U.S.

Specht took up a position as Reader in plant ecology at the University of Melbourne in 1961, and became Acting Head of the Department of Botany in 1964. He moved to the University of Queensland in 1966 as Professor and Head of the Department of Botany and remained there until 1989. He was visiting professor in the Department of Forestry at the University of Oxford in 1970. He was visiting professor in the Department of Botany at the University of Leeds in 1975.

Ray Specht married Marion Gilies in 1952. They met on a University of Queensland Science Student Expedition to Fraser Island in 1949. They had one daughter, Alison.

Specht died on February 13, 2021 in Brisbane, Queensland at the age of 96.




Saturated and unsaturated compounds

In chemistry, a saturated compound is a chemical compound which can't usually do addition reactions, such as hydrogenation, oxidative addition, and the binding of a Lewis base. Therefore an unsaturated compound is the opposite. Saturated compounds are compounds like alkanes. Saturated hydrocarbons contain only carbon to carbon single bonds. Unsaturated compounds are compounds like alkenes or alkynes. Unsaturated hydrocarbons contain a carbon to carbon double bond, or carbon to carbon triple bond.

Hong Kong Time (abbreviation: HKT ; ) () is 8 hours earlier than Greenwich time ().

Tinda

Tinda (), also called "Indian squash", "round melon", "Indian round gourd", "apple gourd" or "Indian baby pumpkin", is a squash-like cucurbit grown for its immature fruit. The fruit is a vegetable that is especially popular in Southern Asia. It is NOT the ""National vegetable of India"."

Indian mackerel

The Indian mackerel ("Rastrelliger kanagurta") is a species of mackerel in the scombrid family (family Scombridae) of order Perciformes. It is commonly found in the Indian and West
Pacific oceans, and their surrounding seas. It is an important food fish and is commonly used in South and South-East Asian cuisine. It is the ""National fish of India"."

It is known by various names, such as 'Kembung' in Indonesia, "Bangda"(बांगडा) in Marathi, "Aiyla"(അയല, ഐല) in Malayalam, "Kumula" (குமுளா) or "Kanaangeluthi" (கானாங்கெளுத்தி) in Tamil and "Bangude" (ಬಂಗುಡೆ) in Tulu, Konkani and Kannada.

Lebensraum

Lebensraum means "Living Space" in German. It is especially associated with Nazi Germany and Hitler's desire to expand the country. This belief led to the Invasion of Poland (1939) and Germany's conquering of the Sudentenland. On June 22, 1941, Nazi Germany launched Operaton Barbarossa, an invasion of the Soviet Union. One of the goals for the operation was achieving Lebensraum.

Mineralocorticoid

Mineralocorticoids are corticosteroids, a type of steroid hormone. Mineralocorticoids are produced in the adrenal cortex. They influence salt and water balances (electrolyte balance and fluid balance). The main mineralocorticoid is aldosterone.

Glucocorticoid

Glucocorticoids (GCs) are steroid hormones made in our adrenal glands. They bind to cell receptors. Glucocorticoids regulate glucose metabolism. 

GCs are part of the feedback system for the immune system. They do things like reducing inflammation. They stimulate the creation of glucose from non-carbohydrate carbons, such as proteins. 

They are important in foetal development, promoting the maturing of the lungs, and are essential for brain development. 

Glucocorticoids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor on cells. The newly formed complex moves into the cell nucleus, where it binds to a region on the target genes. This regulates gene expression. This process is referred to as transcriptional activation, or transactivation.

The proteins encoded by these up-regulated genes have a wide range of effects, including, for example:

A variety of synthetic glucocortisoids have been developed for medical use. In addition to the above two purposes, glucocorticoids play important roles in foetal development, and body fluid homeostasis.

Rational function

A rational function is a polynomial divided by a polynomial. formula_1 is a rational function.

An asymptote is a line that a curve gets closer and closer to touching but never does.

Alphanumeric

An alphanumeric code is one made only of letters and numbers.

However, humans can make mistakes, so the code is used so as to cut out common mistakes. Letters and numbers can be misread. The letters I, O and Q are similar to the numbers 1 and 0. 


"Merriam-Webster dictionary" suggests that the term "alphanumeric" may often additionally refer to other symbols, such as punctuation and mathematical symbols. This opens up a whole range of other possibilities, and a whole range of other confusions. It is not the usual way the term 'alphanumeric' is used. The "Shorter Oxford English Dictionary" defines the term as given above in our first line (though not quite in the same words).

Lastly, it is usual for alphanumeric codes to be "case insensitive", which means it does not matter whether you write them in upper case (capital letters) or lower case (small letters).

Reuleaux triangle

A Reuleaux triangle is a shape made when three circles cross. It looks like a triangle with round sides and pointed corners.

To make one, first draw two dots. Then put a compass on the two dots and draw a circle. Do the same thing again, this time with the other dot as the middle of the circle. Choose either the top or bottom points of the connecting circles as a new center, using the two drawn dots as the edge, and draw the third circle.

If "a" is how wide the Reuleaux triangle is, the area is formula_1. The perimeter is formula_2.

A Reuleaux polygon is a shape like the Reuleaux triangle with an odd number of sides.

A Reuleaux tetrahedron is made when four spheres cross. It looks like a Reuleaux triangle as a pyramid with three sides at the bottom.

Nathaniel Fillmore Jr. (April 19, 1771 – March 28, 1863) was an American farmer and the father of Millard Fillmore, the 13th President of the United States.

Nathaniel Fillmore Jr. was born on April 19, 1771 in Bennington, Bennington County, Vermont, the son of Nathaniel Fillmore Sr. (1739–1814), a native and soldier during the American Revolution, and his wife, Hepzibah Wood (1747–1783). Nathaniel Fillmore Sr. was the son of John Fillmore Jr. (1702–1777), a ship's captain, who was the son of John Fillmore Sr. (1676–1712), a native and mariner.

After his marriage, Fillmore began farming in Vermont. Shortly thereafter, Nathaniel and his brother Calvin Fillmore were approached by land agents offering tracts in New York state. Unhappy with trying to make the stony ground of their Vermont land productive, they quickly grabbed the opportunity and moved to western New York, sight unseen.

According to biographers of Millard Fillmore, "The Fillmore brothers moved their two families to their new homeland nestled deep within a timber-laden forest. Location was not their greatest problem. Nor was the dense clay they unearthed once the land was cleared. Their greatest setback came with the realization that faulty surveying coupled with corrupt local government officials had left them with virtually nothing. Duped, tired, and poor, Nathaniel eventually became a tenant farmer while occasionally teaching school, working the soil for landlords and taking their charity when necessary to survive.

Over time, Nathaniel Fillmore's fortunes changed; he became prominent enough while living in Niles, New York that he served as a justice of the peace for eleven years. He eventually purchased a farm in East Aurora, New York which he developed into a productive enterprise. He died there in 1863, and was buried at East Aurora Cemetery.

Historians have credited his wife, Phoebe, for convincing her husband to secure a clerk’s position for Millard in the office of their landlord, Judge Walter Wood. Though Fillmore did not complete the clerkship, it did set him on the path to a successful legal and political career that carried him to the presidency.

After Millard assumed the presidency in 1850, Nathaniel visited him the following year, Robert J. Scarry writing that the visit was the one most anticipated by President Fillmore.

In 1796, the 25 year-old Fillmore married Phoebe Millard, daughter of a prominent physician, in Bennington. Together, they had nine children:

After Phoebe died in 1831, he remarried to Eunice Love in 1834.

He was the first of only four fathers (the other three being George Tryon Harding, Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., and George H. W. Bush) to live through the entire presidency of a son.


Henry Cary Jr.

Henry Cary, Jr. (Mid to late 1600s – 18th century) was an American businessman and building contractor, active during the early 1700s. He was the father of Col. Archibald Cary.

Henry Cary Jr. was born in Colonial Virginia around the mid to late 1600s, the son of Henry Cary Sr., also a businessman and building contractor, and his wife, Judith Lockey. There are few surviving records of his early life but it is likely that he learned about contracting through his father. Cary married three times and had seven children, three with his first wife Sarah Sclater and four with his second wife, Ann Edwards.

Cary became visibly active in construction after his father's retirement in 1710 and in December 1720 he was authorized to work on the Governor's Palace, in Williamsburg, Virginia, a project that his father had begun but was unable to complete. This was one of several jobs that Cary performed at Williamsburg and in 1726 he was hired to construct new gates for the Capitol.

He went on to oversee the construction of several buildings at the College of William & Mary (also in Williamsburg): a chapel wing (1729) and the President's House (1732), and Cary was also likely in charge of constructing the Brafferton building (1723).

Around 1733, Cary moved to the bank of the James River, where he built Ampthill, in Chesterfield County, Virginia, which served as the Cary family home for many generations.

Eliza Manningham-Buller

Elizabeth Lydia "Eliza" Manningham-Buller, Baroness Manningham-Buller LG DCB (born 14 July 1948) is one of the most senior women in British public life.

She was Director General of MI5, the British internal Security Service, from October 2002 until her retirement on 20 April 2007, aged 58. She became a crossbench life peer on 18 April 2008. She is now chair of the Wellcome Trust, the largest private financer of medical research in the UK.

Her father, Reginald Manningham-Buller, was Lord Chancellor from 1954 to 1962. Ms Manninham-Buller was educated at Northampton High School, Beneden School and Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. She was recruited into the Security Service in her 20s.

Specializing in counter-terrorism rather than MI5's usual counter-espionage, she was active at the time of the Lockerbie bombing by Libya in 1988. She worked for K-branch against the IRA. During the early 1980s she was said to be one of only five people who knew that Oleg Gordievsky, the deputy head of the KGB at the Soviet Embassy in London, was actually a double agent.

She was sent to Washington, D.C. as liaison to the US intelligence community over the first Gulf War. Then she led the newly created MI5 Irish counter-terrorism section from 1992. She was promoted to the Management Board of the Security Service the next year.

Manningham-Buller became the director in charge of surveillance and technical operations. She was appointed Deputy Director General in 1997, and succeeded Sir Stephen Lander as Director General in 2002. She was the second woman to take on the role after Dame Stella Rimington. As Director General, she was paid £150,000 a year. She established a website and recruited agents through newspaper advertisements. Under her direction, terror risk assessments were made public for the first time.

In the 2005 Birthday Honours, Manningham-Buller was appointed to the Order of the Bath as a Dame Commander (DCB). She resigned from MI5 on 21 April 2007, and was succeeded by her deputy, Jonathan Evans. That month marked the end of her 33rd year in the Security Service. She was raised to the peerage as Baroness Manningham-Buller, of Northampton in the County of Northamptonshire on 2 June 2008.

In June 2011, the BBC announced Eliza Manningham-Buller would present the 2011 Reith Lectures, alongside the Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi in a series entitled Securing Freedom. Eliza Manningham-Buller's lectures broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and the BBC world service in September 2011, marked the ten-year anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the United States.

In her first lecture, titled "Terror", recorded at BBC Broadcasting House in London, she reflected on the lasting significance of 11 September 2001, asking was it a terrorist crime, an act of war, or something different. She also examined the impact the US-led invasion of Iraq had on the fight against al-Qaeda.

In her second lecture, titled "Security", recorded at the Leeds City Museum, she said that the use of torture is "wrong and never justified" and should be "utterly rejected even when it may offer the prospect of saving lives". She said that the use of torture had not made the world a safer place, adding that the use of water-boarding by the United States was a "profound mistake" and as a result America lost its "moral authority".

In her third and final lecture, titled "Freedom", recorded at the British Library in London, she discussed foreign policy priorities since the September 11 attacks. She stated that it was "necessary" to talk to dictators and terrorists, to protect security and said that the British government's decision to engage with Colonel Gaddafi in 2003 was "the right decision". She went on to say that protecting British citizens would be impossible if the security services were restricted to talking only to those with shared values and cited examples where people once deemed terrorists were now part of the political establishment: "Look at Northern Ireland, where former terrorists are in government... look at Mandela and the ANC which used terror tactics when it was in exile."

Cheetah (comics)

The Cheetah is a fictional character, created by William Moulton Marston. She appears in DC Comics publications and related media, commonly as a major villain to the superhero Wonder Woman.

In 2009, The Cheetah was ranked as IGN's 69th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time. Cheetah has superhuman speed, reaction time, strength and durability to an unknown degree. Her sense of smell has also been enhanced and she is able to see in the dark.

There have been four incarnations of the Cheetah: Priscilla Rich (Golden and Silver Age), Deborah Domaine (Bronze Age), Dr. Barbara Ann Minerva (Post-"Crisis" and current), and Sebastian Ballesteros (a male usurper who briefly assumed the role in 2001).

Kristen Wiig plays Dr. Barbara Ann Minerva, a.k.a Cheetah, in "Wonder Woman 1984", the 8th movie in the DC Extended Universe. She is an enemy of Wonder Woman.

The Golden Age Cheetah was socialite Priscilla Rich. Jealous of Wonder Woman's fame, Priscilla was driven to villainy by her second personality, the Cheetah. Donning a cheetah costume, Priscilla became Wonder Woman's arch nemesis, until her retirement and eventual death. As of the New 52 onwards Pricclia was reconned to be just an alias for Barbara.

The niece of the Golden Age Cheetah, Deborah was a friend of Wonder Woman, until the villainous Kobra brainwashed her into picking up her aunt's evil legacy. This version no longer exists due to the Crisis on Infinite Earths. In the New 52 onwards Deborah is just an alias for Barbara.

Much like her Golden Age predecessor, Dr. Barbara Ann Minerva was driven by envy to become a villain. A selfish, spoiled heiress, Minerva received her Cheetah powers and form from the sacrifice of her partner to an African plant god. However, because the ceremony is meant for virgins her powers are half curse, half blessing.

Minerva decided to challenge Wonder Woman's powers upon hearing of her arrival to Man's World in order to steal her magic lasso. Since then, the Cheetah has proven to be one of Wonder Woman's greatest enemies, as well as one of her primary arch enemies and has shown that women can be just as bad as men.

In the Justice League, she is one of the recurring enemies in both the original series and its sequel series. Press materials names her "A feline femme fatale who is scratching for a fight."

In the New 52 she grew up in an orphanage in Idaho and had alias of Priscilla ,Deborah, and Sebastian she would soon become Cheetah and oppose Wonder Woman

The Dc Rebirth version is more sympathetic and was good friends with Wonder Woman until she became Cheetah.

A native to Argentina, corrupt businessman Sebastian Ballesteros was briefly the fourth Cheetah after stealing Minerva's powers, but was killed by her out of revenge. New 52 retcons him as just an alias for Barbara.

The fifth cheetah was a former amazon who died but was revived by Belladona to become the fifth cheetah to kill wonder woman but failed and died to her instead.

The character has been adapted to different forms of media, including action figures, television series, and video games. In live action, the Barbara Ann Minerva version of Cheetah is portrayed by actress Kristen Wiig in the DC Extended Universe movie "Wonder Woman 1984" (2020).

Sivana was soon established as Captain Marvel's archenemy and the Shazam/Marvel Family as a whole, serving as one of the two main antagonists of the "SHAZAM!" franchise (alongside Mister Mind). He has also served as an enemy towards Superman, the Justice League, the Outsiders, the Titans, and has been a part of numerous villainous organizations, such as the Secret Society of Super Villains, the Fearsome Five, the Monster Society of Evil, and the Science Squad. In 2009, Doctor Sivana was ranked as IGN's 82nd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time. 

Beck has said Parker created Sivana's name by combining the name of the Indian god Siva with the word "nirvana".

"Doc-Doc-Dockers"
"Show 'em how we rock"
"Freo, heave ho!"
"Doc-Doc-Dockers"
"Show 'em how we roll"
"Go Dockers, go, go, go!"
