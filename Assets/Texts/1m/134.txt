With 44 German national medals, Ortmann is one of the best German pool players ever.

Ortmann was put into the Straight Pool Hall of Fame in an August 2013 ceremony in New York City. The following year, he was entered into the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame.

Ortmann was born and raised in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. At age six he began playing on a pool table in his parents' restaurant. Ortmann won his first event in 1985 at age 17 (the 8-Ball Junior European championships), defeating Sweden's Per Anda in the final. The following year he won his first German national championship (the straight pool championship), after meeting Thomas Engert in the final. Ortmann studied in Munich to become an electronics technician, and at age 20 he became the manager of a billiard centre with 80 pool and billiard tables.

He was the first player from Europe to win the U.S. Open Straight Pool Championship in 1989. He won the event despite it being his first trip outside of Europe. As an unknown player, Ortmann defeated Steve Mizerak in the final. Ortmann also won his first of many adult European Pool Championship events that year, beating Waldemar Markert in the straight-pool final.

Arrest and trial of Jesus

In Christianity, the Arrest and Trial of Jesus is an event that takes place in February/March of 30 AD, before the Death and Ressurrection of Jesus and after the Last Supper.

The New Testament Gospels all tell the story of how Jesus was arrested. His trial is told with many details. Jesus was with his disciples in a garden where He was praying. After dark, some soldiers came. With them was Judas Iscariot. Judas kissed Jesus to show the soldiers who He was. The soldiers took Jesus prisoner. All of the other followers of Jesus ran away.

Jesus was taken to the high priest where he was questioned. He was accused of many things by false witnesses. Finally, the high priest asked Jesus if he was the Son of God. Jesus said it was true and that in the future he would come in the clouds. The high priest then said that Jesus was guilty of blasphemy.

Since the Romans did not allow the Jewish authorities to kill anyone, Jesus was then brought to Pontius Pilate. Pilate was the Roman governor. He also asked Jesus many questions. Jesus didn't answer some of the questions, but he told Pilate that he was a king. But he said that his kingdom was "not of this world". Pilate wanted to release Jesus, but the crowd demanded instead that Jesus be crucified. To prevent a riot, Pilate agreed to their demand.

Australian Shield

The Australian Shield (or Western Plateau) is Australia's largest drainage division.

It is mainly the old rock shield of Gondwana. It covers two thirds of the continent: 2,700,000 square kilometres of dry land including large parts of Western Australia, South Australia, and the Northern Territory. For comparison, it is roughly the same size as the whole of continental Europe from Poland to Portugal. 

Rain rarely falls in this region. Apart from a handful of permanent waterholes, surface water is absent at all times except after heavy rain. Most of the territory is flat sandy or stony desert with a sparse covering of shrubs or tussock grasses. Average rainfall varies from one area to another. It has 100 to 350 mm of rainfall per year (between four and 14 inches).

There are no permanent watercourses. The general trend is for run-off to flow inland, but there is not enough rainfall to make any marked drainage pattern. There is a total inflow to Australia's water resources of 292 BCM (billion cubic metres). Two water management areas (the Great Artesian Basin and the Mereenie Sandstone – Alice Springs) used more water than the total annual inflow.

According to the Prime Minister's office, as the effects of climate change intensifies, Australia faces increasingly acute long-term water shortages with lower rainfall, rivers drying up and dam water levels falling.

Rennes-le-Château is a French commune located in the southwest of the Aude department in the Occitanie region.

The commune is part of the Corbières massif, a limestone chaos that forms the transition between the Massif Central and the Pyrenees. Subject to a modified oceanic climate, it is drained by the Blanque river, the Couleurs stream, and various other small watercourses.

A rural commune, it had 91 inhabitants in 2020, after experiencing a population peak of 474 inhabitants in 1851. Its inhabitants are called Rennains or Rennaines.

Its territory was part of the ancient Carolingian county of Razès, whose oppidum, called Rhedae, is believed to have been located at the site of the current village.

The commune was made famous by the priest Bérenger Saunière, one of its curates, who lived and officiated in the parish at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century and undertook at his own expense renovations and beautifications of the church and its surroundings. Despite the lack of historical evidence, various authors have suggested that he found a treasure in 1885, the exact origin and nature of which are unknown. In fact, Saunière was subjected to a suspense a divinis following an investigation into mass trafficking conducted against him by his hierarchy, a severe punishment for a priest at any time. The priest also had difficulty explaining himself, refusing to provide clear and detailed justifications to his hierarchy about the origin of his supposed fortune.

As a result of such notoriety, Rennes-le-Château has seen an increasing influx of tourists since the late 1960s, with the region also being rich in historical and prehistoric sites. The municipal council decided to dedicate a museum to Abbé Saunière and his servant, located in the heart of the village.

Uenuku

Uenuku is a god of rainbows and important ancestor in Māori oral histories. Uenuku simply means 'rainbow'.

Uenuku is special to the Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Kahungunu, Ngāti Porou, Ngāi Tahu, and Ngāi Tūhoe Māori tribes. He is also known to two groups of tribes called Kurahaupō and Tainui. The Te Arawa group of tribes also know of him. Some of these tribes may also say he is a god of war.

Geoff Murphy made his first movie in 1974, which was based on Uenuku's story. It was the first TV drama to be entirely spoken in the Māori language.

The tribes of Ngāti Porou, Ngāi Tahu, and probably Ngāti Kahungunu say Chief Uenuku of Hawaiki was their ancestor. He was the father of about 70 sons. His eldest son Ruatapu killed Hawaiki's nobility when he was shamed for trying to use a sacred comb.

In Te Arawa stories, Tamatekapua and his brother Whakaturia stole fruit from Chief Uenuku of Hawaiki.

In the Cook Islands, Uanuku Rakeiora is said to be an important chiefly ancestor from Raiatea Island in French Polynesia over 27 generations ago, who was descended from Iro-nui-ma-Oata.

In the stories mostly known to Ngāi Tūhoe, but which also belong to Ngāpuhi and Ngāti Kahungunu of Wairoa, Uenuku was once human. One early morning he went out hunting. In a clearing he found two women. One was named Hine-pūkohu-rangi (sometimes called Tairi-a-kohu). The other was her sister, named Hine-wai. He asked Hine-pūkohu-rangi to stay and talk with him, and to return the next night. Since she lived in the sky, she had to leave him at dawn when her sister Hine-wai called her. She kept coming back night after night, and they fell in love. Eventually, she agreed to marry him so long as he promised that he tell no one about her.

They were happy for many months, though she still only came to him at night and left at dawn. In time she became pregnant. No one else could see her, though, and therefore he was mocked by the people around him. They grew suspicious of this wife they had never seen, and the daughter who in some tellings was already born. He tried to tell them that his wife left him each morning at first light, so they suggested that he should block up the doors and windows so she could not see the sun. Finally after more mockery, he was convinced to block the sunlight after she came to him, so that she could not see the sun in the morning, then he could prove she existed. That night, Uenuku blocked all the places in his house that would shine the daylight. In the morning, she felt betrayed when she realised he had tricked her. She went back to the sky and left him for as long as he lived.
Uenuku wandered the world searching for his wife. He searched until he was old and frail. Rangi the sky father noticed this and took pity on Uenuku, and changed him into a rainbow so that he could join his family in the sky, where they still live to this day and watch over their descendants.

The tribes of the "Kurahaupō" in Marlborough canoe know the mountain Tapuae-o-Uenuku (which means 'footprint of the rainbow') on the Kaikōura Ranges as being the place where Chief Tapuae-nuku climbed the rainbow steps of his war-god ancestor Uenuku. They both climbed and died on top of mountains in search of their supernatural wives. Uenuku became a set of mountains with his wife and daughter, and Chief Tapuae-nuku joined his own wife and daughter in the afterlife. When a rainbow appears over Tapuae-o-Uenuku, it is said to be a sign of Chief Tapuae-nuku's journey.

According to legend, the spirit of Uenuku was brought from Hawaiki to New Zealand in a stone by the people on the Tainui canoe. When they landed, they made the large carving called "Te Uenuku" out of a tōtara tree with a round opening at the top, in which the stone was placed so that the god could live in the carving. It is unique among other Māori carvings, and looks similar to Hawaiian carving styles.

Osmoregulation

Osmoregulation is how living things keep the right amount of salt and water in their bodies. All living things do this, from bacteria to humans.

The basic idea is that organisms keep osmotic pressure by controlling their water and salt concentrations. There are regulators and conformers. Conformers match their environment, and regulators do things which act to keep their internal water at a standard level of saltiness.

Sea fish, for example, tend to gain salt if they live in seawater. So they actively put out (excrete) salt from their gills. River fish, on the other hand, take the salt out before they excrete water. Some fish, like the flounder, live in both fresh and salt water at different stages in its life. They adapt to whichever water they are in.

All plants regulate their water balance. Xerophytes like cacti keep water inside so they do not become too salty. Plants that live in seasonal wetlands also have ways of avoiding desiccation. Many plant leaves have a waterproof cuticle to regulate the loss of water, and use spiracles for gas exchange. Osmoregulation is an important aspect of homeostasis. it involves the balance between water and solute contents of cells.

The change from being in water to living on land was one of the most significant things which happened in evolution. From the perspective of water balance this was one of the most dramatic changes ever made. Suddenly, the new land animal had the problem of losing too much water through its skin, and taking in too little if it moved away from the water.

Kidneys are the organ of osmoregulation in vertebrates, including humans. In the nephron, blood is filtered through the glomerulus. The filtrate, water, salts, and other small molecules, enters the tubule of the nephron. In excretion, the filtrate which remains in the tube leaves the kidney and becomes urine.

The amount of water reabsorbed is controlled by hormones such as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), aldosterone, and angiotensin II. For example, too high solute concentration in the blood (osmolarity) is detected by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus (part of the brain). The hypothalamus then stimulates ADH release from the pituitary gland to make the walls of the collecting ducts more permeable to water. Therefore, more water is reabsorbed from fluid in the kidneys to prevent too much water from being excreted.

As an illustration of how universal osmoregulation is, bacteria also do it.

Standard medical books of course have sections on the human kidney and the human water regulation. The complex details of hormone interaction is not covered in this brief summary.
Osmoregulation in animals generally is one of the issues surveyed in:

Socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a larger effect more than the disease itself. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, many people have begun to think about the economic effects such as the decreased business and unemployment. The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown.

Supply shortages were expected to affect a number of sectors due to panic buying, increased usage of goods to during the pandemic, and people raising up prices on needed products such as masks, toilet paper, plastic gloves and hand sanitizer. Reports of lack of food or groceries were said. The pandemic also caused many social events to be pushed back such as concert delays and movie release dates. Many movie theaters are being put out of business.

There was an increase in gleaning, meaning people going to farms to pick up food plants left over on the ground after a harvest. Because restaurants and other food businesses canceled their orders, farmers had more extra crops than usual. People formed new organizations to find farmers with extra food, organize people to collect it, and transport it to food banks and other places where people could get to it.

Global stock markets fell on 24 February 2020 due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China. By 28 February 2020, stock markets worldwide saw their largest single-week declines since the 2008 financial crisis. Global stock markets crashed in March 2020.

It is likely that business money losses are to be in the billions and increasing. By 16 March, news reports emerged indicating that the effect on the United States economy would be worse than previously thought.

According to the World Data Lab, Africa's middle class is at risk because of the coronavirus pandemic. According to one economist from the Africa and the Middle East at Standard Chartered Bank, a middle-class person is someone who is not rich but does have a steady income. In Africa, about 170 million people are middle class and about 8 million of them could lose their businesses or become poor because of COVID-19. This is because one of the industries that has helped Africa's middle class rise over the past 30 years is tourism, and many countries closed borders and encouraged people not to travel. Experts say this is especially bad because a strong middle class lifts the whole country.

Nigeria and other African countries are also affected by low oil prices. Because people all over the world are driving and flying and traveling less, oil costs less. That means oil companies make less money. Many of them have fired some of their employees in Africa. Then those employees do not have money to spend on local businesses.

The coronavirus pandemic increased the amount of money spent through cashless payments, like credit cards and aps, over cash, meaning coins and paper bills. The United Nations and many specific countries, such as Kenya and Sweden, encouraged people to pay for things without using cash. Physical coins and bills can carry germs. Credit cards and aps make it easier for people to pay for things without touching other people. This means that the store or other seller must pay a fee to the credit card company or app company.

Experts say this may cause problems for immigrants, people with disabilities and other people who cannot easily sign up for credit cards or aps.

The pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide causing many schools and universities to close down. According to data released by UNESCO on 25 March, school and university closures due to COVID-19 were caused in 165 countries. Including localized closures, this affects over 1.5 billion students worldwide. Many classes were suspended for the rest of the school year with many tacking online classes.

In the United Kingdom, some schools stayed open and taught the children of essential workers, at-risk children, and children with special education needs. According to the Independent Provider of Special Education Advice organization, British educators unfairly sent special education students home either for no reason or by claiming that they could not wash their hands or keep a safe social distance.

COVID-19 did not affect everyone in each country the same way. As of May 2020, APM Research Lab said the death rate among black Americans was 2.4 times as high as for whites and 2.2 times as high as for Latino and Asian Americans. In July 2020, "The New York Times" printed data from the Centers for Disease Control showing that black and Latino Americans were three times as likely to become sick and twice as likely to die as white Americans. This showed some difference from place to place, but it was mostly true in both cities and the country, regardless of how old people were. Native Americans were also more likely than whites to become sick and die. Asian Americans were 1.3 times as likely to become sick as whites were. Camara Jones, an epidemiologist who once worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said this was socioeconomic and not because of any natural difference in black and white people's bodies. In the United States, black citizens are more likely to work jobs where they serve the public and to ride on buses and trains rather than take their own cars to work, which makes them more likely to be infected than people who work in private offices or from home. Sharrelle Barber, an epidemiologist and biostatistician from Drexel University, also said black Americans can live in crowded neighborhoods where social distancing is harder to do and healthy food harder to find. Both Barber and Jones blamed the long history of racism in the United States for these things. Three senators, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren, said the federal government should start recording the race of COVID-19 patients so scientists could study this problem.

In the United Kingdom, twice as many black COVID-19 patients died as white COVID-19 patients. Other non-white people, like people from India and Bangledesh, were also more likely to die of COVID-19 than whites. Britain's Office of National Statistics said that the differences in money and education explained some of this difference but not all of it. They also said they did not know whether non-white patients caught COVID-19 more often or whether they caught more severe cases. Only female Chinese Britons were less likely to die of COVID-19 than white Britons.

Native Americans in the United States have shown more deaths from COVID-19 than the rest of the U.S. As of May, the Navajo Nation had 88 deaths and 2,757 cases, and the money they had been promised by the government arrived weeks late. Only 30% of the people in the Navajo Nation have pipes with running water, which made it difficult for people to wash their hands.

Scientists from Chapman University made a plan to protect the Tsimane people in Bolivia from COVID-19 and said this plan would also work for other indigenous peoples living on their own land. The scientists said that many indigenous peoples have problems that make COVID-19 more dangerous for them, like poverty, less clean water, and other lung diseases. Hospitals may be a long distance away, and racism can affect the way doctors and nurses react. But they also sometimes have things that help, like traditions of making decisions together and the ability to grow food nearby. The scientists found people who spoke the Tsimane language as a first language and made teams to go to Tsimane towns to warn them about COVID-19. They also used radio stations. They said the best strategy was for whole communities to decide to isolate. They found this worked well because the Tsimane already usually made their big decisions together as a community in special meetings and already had a tradition of quarantining new mothers. The Chapman scientists said their plan would also work for other indigenous peoples who also make decisions together, like the Tsimane.

In April 2020, police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota in the United States killed an unarmed black man called George Floyd while they were arresting him. There were months of protests all over the world against police racism. Many people said that the reason the protests were so big was not only because of racism but also because COVID-19 hurt more non-white people than other people, both by making them sick and by costing them their jobs.

Scholar Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith of the Yale School of Medicine said, "They are protesting against police brutality and excessive force, no question, but they're also protesting for the ability to live their lives fully and completely, and to not have their lives cut short, either by force or preventable diseases."

Job losses also meant people had more time to protest. On "The Daily Show", athlete Anquan Boldin said he thought all the cancelled sports events were also making the protests bigger and more focused: "The one thing I'm happy that is not happening right now is that sports isn't being played." He then named many tournaments and other events that had been cancelled. "...and everybody "could" be distracted by those things that are going on, but because you don't have sports, everybody's attention is focused on this one thing. And I think, for us, this is the opportunity to really create change."

The pandemic has had a large impact on aviation business due to Travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as a decrease in demand among travelers. Many reductions in passenger numbers has caused in planes flying empty between airports and the cancellation of flights.

The cruise ship business has also been affected by a decrease, with the share prices of the major cruise lines down 70-80%.

On 18 March 2020, the World Health Organization issued a report about mental health and psychosocial issues during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Due to doubts if pets or other livestock can pass on coronavirus to humans, many people did not want to keep their pets as they were scared of getting the disease. In the Arab World, celebrities were telling people to keep and protect their pets. Meanwhile, people in the U.K. bought more pets during the coronavirus lockdown to not be lonely.

Many countries have reported an increase in domestic violence and intimate partner violence because of lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The coronavirus pandemic has been followed by a concern for a possible increase in suicides due to quarantine and social-distancing guidelines, fear, and unemployment and financial reasons.

Most of the time, people who work during the week sleep and wake earlier on weekdays than they do on weekends. This is called social jetlag and it leads to poor sleep. Scientists from the University of Basel said the lockdowns made people sleep longer and at healthier times, so there was less social jetlag. They said this was because even people who still worked did so from home, so they did not have to get up early to travel to work. They also found that people did not sleep as well because they were worried.

The pandemic affected families. In a study from Vanderbilt University, 27% of American parents said their mental health had gotten worse and 14% of parents reported their children's mental health had gotten worse. Many families lost child care and health insurance. Many families found it more difficult to get enough food. Families with younger children were more affected because they were more likely to miss child care.

Isolation (health care)

In hospitals or health care areas, isolation is one of the many measures that can be taken to stop the spread of certain diseases as it would lower the amount of people being infected by it. The most recent case are people being forced by law to stay at home as schools and jobs are closed due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. This is different than quarantine as this is for people who have not been infected.

According to the CDC, isolation is the act of separating a sick individual with a contagious disease from healthy individuals without that contagious disease in order to protect the public from getting the contagious disease.

Contagious diseases can spread to others through many forms. Four types of infectious disease transmission can happen: (1) contact transmission, which can be through direct physical contact (2) vehicular transmission, which involves contaminated objects, (3) airborne transmission, which involves spread of infectious particles through air, and (4) vector transmission, which is spread through insects or animals. Since diseases can spread through many forms of transmission it is important for people who are not infected to stay at home so that they won't get sick. For those who are sick then it is important for them to quarantine to make sure they don't spread the disease.



COVID-19 recession

The coronavirus recession, also known as the Great Lockdown or Great Shutdown, was a major global economic recession affecting the world economy in 2020 during and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The recession caused the largest economic downturn since the Great Depression. On 14 April 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that all of the G7 nations had already entered or were entering into what was called a "deep recession". The IMF has stated that the economic decline is "far worse" than that of the Great Recession in 2009.

The pandemic has led to more than a third of the world's population being placed on lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19. This has caused severe economic downfalls for economies across the world, following soon after a global economic slowdown during 2019 that saw a lowering numbers in stock markets worldwide.

The United Nations (UN) predicted in April 2020 that global unemployment will wipe out 6.7 per cent of working hours globally in the second quarter of 2020—equivalent to 195 million full-time workers.

The recession saw the fall of the price of oil caused by the 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war, the collapse of the tourism industry, hospitality industry, energy industry, and a large decrease in consumer activity.

Global stock markets crashed around 20 to 30% during late February and March 2020. During the crash, global stock markets had many swings, mainly due to uncertainty in the markets.

COVID-19 misinformation

<onlyinclude>The pandemic has caused a large number of conspiracy theories and misinformation about where the pandemic started, how serious it is and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

According to the World Health Organization, the pandemic was also an "infodemic", with misinformation spreading like disease.</onlyinclude> This was because social media let information spread quickly, because celebrities sometimes repeated conspiracy theories, and because many people were locked down at home without much else to listen to. When doctors or government officials went on television to say these conspiracy theories were wrong, that only made people think the conspiracy theories were important enough for doctors and officials to talk about. One group of scientists said governments could use conspiracy theories to distract people from real problems.

Fake information has been spread through social media, text messages, and mass media, including the state media of countries such as China, Russia, Iran, and Turkmenistan.

It has been spread by celebrities, politicians (including leaders in countries such as the United States, Iran, and Brazil), and other important public figures. Commercial scams have claimed to offer at-home tests and "miracle" cures. 

Other claims include that the virus is a bio-weapon with a patented vaccine, a population control scheme, or the result of a spy operation. Many theories say that there is a link between the virus and Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). They believe that the virus escaped from the WIV by accident.

One survey by Pew Research showed 29% of Americans who answered thought SARS-CoV-2 could have been made in a lab on purpose and 23% thought it could have been made in a lab by accident.

In early May 2020, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there was "enormous evidence" that the virus was from a laboratory in Wuhan. but he said it could have been an accident. Intelligence officials and virus scientists said it was more likely that the virus had not come from a lab.

A survey of people in the United Kingdom showed many of them thought COVID-19 was caused by 5G wireless networks.

When the leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei, said that he did not want the United States to help his country against coronavirus, he named the idea that Americans had made the virus on purpose to harm Iranians as one of his reasons: "I do not know how real this accusation is but when it exists, who in their right mind would trust you to bring them medication?"

On March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in "Nature Medicine" showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory. They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. Within a few weeks, this became one of the most cited scientific papers in history, meaning other scientists were reading it and using its information.

Remdesivir

Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral medication created by the biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences. It was designed to treat Ebola.

As of 2020, remdesivir is being tested as a specific treatment for COVID-19. It is being used for the sickest of patients during the pandemic. It may shorten the time it takes to recover from the infection. Treatment is given by injection into a vein.

On May 1, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave doctors permission to use remdesivir on patients with COVID-19. Ordinarily, the FDA would test remdesivir first to see if it worked on patients with COVID-19, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they told doctors they could start using the drug before the tests were finished.

In October 2020, the National Institutes of Health told the world the results of its tests: They studied 11,000 people and found that remdesivir did not help keep COVID-19 patients alive. Gilead and some scientists said the results of the tests might not be correct.

History of Ireland

The history of Ireland begins in the past. Ireland is now divided into the Republic of Ireland, and Northern Ireland which is part of the United Kingdom. People began farming on Ireland thousands of years ago. The Celts moved there about 2,500 years ago. Ireland was divided into many small kingdoms. When Christians arrived, most Irish people became Christian. The Vikings and later the Normans invaded in the Middle Ages. Eventually, Ireland became part of the United Kingdom, with Great Britain. In the 1920s, most of Ireland became a separate country, but Northern Ireland stayed in the United Kingdom.

Nobody knows exactly when the first people came to Ireland. Using radiometric dating, scientists found that a bear bone with knife marks was 12,500 years old. It is likely that people lived in Ireland then. By 7900 BCE, hunter-gatherers (people who ate wild plants and animals) lived in Ireland. This time was called the Stone Age. Around 4000 BCE, they started making farms with animals and plants. They made pottery, stone tools, wood houses, and large tombs. The Bronze Age started around 2500 BCE. People learned to make things out of metals like bronze, gold, and copper, but it was mostly only rich people who had them. People also started weaving and working with leather. Large rooms were built to store metal weapons. The Iron Age started around 600 BCE or earlier, when people started making iron tools. During the Iron Age, Celts came to Ireland, so they started speaking Celtic languages. The Celts brought their style of art with them. Between 1 and 400 CE, Roman soldiers may have invaded Ireland, but Ireland did not join the Roman Empire. About five kings each ruled a large part of Ireland.

In the 300s CE, Christianity and writing were both brought to Ireland. Saint Patrick was famous for spreading Christianity in Ireland in the 400s, but he was not the first Christian in Ireland. For the next 300–400 years, more Irish people became Christian. Christian monks from other countries came to Irish monasteries. Some monasteries grew into towns. The main buildings from 400-800 CE were round forts (raths or ringforts) made of dirt, with houses inside. Most of the forests were cut down to make farms. There were some new kingdoms in this time. The kingdom of Uí Néill in north Ireland took over the area called Tara, then ruled over all the other kingdoms. They were called the high kings.

By 800 almost everyone was Christian. They were called Gaels and they spoke the Gaelic language. In 795, the Vikings, sailors from Scandinavia, invaded and stole from many towns. The Vikings ruled over Irish kings. They built Dublin and other cities and towns on the coast. In 902 the Christian Irish armies pushed out the Vikings, but in 917 the Vikings came back to start a new kingdom of Dublin. Over time, Vikings started new kingdoms. In the 1000s and 1100s, the Vikings either left or became part of Irish culture.

Brian Boru, a King of Munster, fought against Leinster and became the high king in the early 1000s. After that, high kings came from the four provinces: Munster, Leinster, Ulster, and Connacht. Each province also had its own king.

In the 1100s, Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair was the high king. He forced Diarmaid Mac Murchada, the king of Leinster, to leave his kingdom. Diarmaid asked Henry II, a Norman king of England, to help him get his land back. Henry agreed, so an army of Norman (and Welsh) knights invaded Ireland in 1167. Richard de Clare, called Strongbow, led the knights. Henry thought the Norman knights and Strongbow were too powerful, so he decided to take over Ireland. He traveled to Ireland with his own fleet in 1171. Henry conquered Ireland and gave it to his youngest son John. Henry thought John would never be king of England, so he made John Lord of Ireland. But John became king of England in 1199 after all his brothers died. After that, Ireland was ruled by the English king. Norman lords from England started taking over more of Ireland. They mostly lived near the east and south coasts, and some land was still ruled by Irish kings.

The Norman lords built new castles and towns in their land. Many people came from England to Ireland for more land. The English, Norman, or Anglo-Norman lords broke up land into areas called manors. They put fences around farms so everyone would know who owned the farm. Farms were made better so they could grow more in a smaller area. The Anglo-Normans planted more wheat and raised more sheep. The population grew quickly. In 1297, Anglo-Normans started the Irish Parliament, a gathering to make laws.

The Gaelic Irish often tried to take control from the Anglo-Normans. In 1315, Edward Bruce, a lord from Scotland, allied with the Irish to fight the Anglo-Normans. In 1318 the Anglo-Normans won the war. But the Anglo-Norman rulers became weaker. By 1500, England only controlled a small part of eastern Ireland, called the Pale. In the rest of Ireland, people spoke Irish and had Irish culture.

Ireland had a governor (ruler) who was supposed to be loyal to the King of England. In the 1530s, Thomas Fitzgerald, the governor, rebelled against England. Because of this, King Henry VIII of England wanted more power. In 1541, he declared himself King of Ireland instead of Lord of Ireland. The English built military forts in Ireland. English settlers moved to areas in Ireland called plantations. They used English laws and took over a lot of Ireland. During the Nine Years War in the 1590s, Irish soldiers from Ulster fought the English.

Most of the Irish people were Catholic. The settlers were mostly Protestant. In Ulster, the largest plantation, settlers were mostly Presbyterians from Scotland. In the other provinces, the settlers were mostly Anglicans from England. English kings and the English Parliament wanted the Irish people to be Anglican. They made the Church of Ireland, a branch of the Anglican Church. The Penal Laws of the 1600s punished Irish people who did not follow the Church of Ireland. The Anglicans grew more powerful. This time was called the Protestant Ascendancy. That was the end of Gaelic Ireland.

In the 1700s, the Catholic people of Ireland were poor peasants. They were not allowed to own land, and much of the food they produced was exported overseas by England. Forcing them to mostly eat potatoes. There were rebellions against landlords and English rule, but they mostly failed. In 1801, the Acts of Union joined Ireland with Great Britain, forming the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (UK). The Irish parliament became part of the United Kingdom parliament in London.

In 1831, the government forced primary schools to teach in English, not Irish. Children were punished if they spoke Irish in school. People had to speak English if they wanted a good job. From 1845-1849, a disease killed potato plants, which caused the Great Famine, or the Irish Potato Famine. About a million people starved to death, and a million more moved to other countries. The famine hurt Irish speakers the most, because they were poor. More people switched from speaking Irish to English. Some say people starved because crops in Ireland were sold to other countries. These crops could have fed people in Ireland. Many Irish people were forced to leave their land because they could not pay rent to the landlords. Some had to work in factories set up by the government, because of the Irish Poor Laws. From the 1870s to the 1890s, there was violence between the Land League and the government. The Land League wanted lower rent and they wanted to buy land.

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the British government made it easier for Irish people to buy land. In 1886 the Liberal Party tried to make a new parliament for Ireland. This idea was called Home Rule. However, Parliament did not allow Ireland to have Home Rule. Around 1900, Irish people were split into Nationalists, who wanted Home Rule or independence, and Unionists, who wanted to be ruled by Britain. Nationalists were mostly Catholics who lived in rural areas. Unionists were mostly Protestants who lived in cities. The Unionists worried they would lose their rights if Ireland had its own government. In some parts of Ireland, Unionists were mostly rich. But in Ulster, many Unionists were workers who wanted the upper class to have less power.

In 1912 some people in Parliament tried again to get Home Rule. About 500,000 Unionists in Ulster signed a petition against Home Rule called the Ulster Convenant. They also formed an army called the Ulster Volunteers. Irish Nationalists formed an army called the Irish Volunteers. By 1914, the government was too worried about World War I to think about Home Rule. Both Nationalists and Unionists fought in British military units in World War I.

In 1916, there was a rebellion by Irish people who wanted to be independent. Britain stopped it quickly but many Irish were angry. They elected Sinn Féin, an independence party, to most Irish seats in Parliament. Sinn Féin members refused to go to London to join Parliament. Instead they started a new assembly in Dublin called the Dáil Éireann (or Dáil). Sinn Féin said that Ireland was now independent. In 1918 they organized the Irish Volunteers into the Irish Republican Army (IRA). From 1919-1921, the IRA fought a war against the British (Irish War of Independence) to be a separate country. In 1920 the British government decided to divide Ireland into Southern Ireland (The Provisional Government), which was about 5/6 of the island, and Northern Ireland. The Dáil and Britain signed a treaty in 1922 to make Southern Ireland into the Irish Free State. It was still connected to the UK, but it had more freedom. However, the IRA wanted to fully leave the UK. They fought a war (Irish Civil War) against the Irish Free State government. The IRA stopped fighting in 1923.

Northern Ireland was governed by the Ulster Unionist Party from 1922-1972. James Craig, its first prime minister, said it was a Protestant country. The Irish Free State got a new constitution in 1937, which created its government. In 1949, Ireland left the British Commonwealth and became the Republic of Ireland (sometimes just called Ireland). In 1969, violence was growing in Northern Ireland between the Nationalist Catholics and Unionist Protestants. The Provisional IRA formed to defend Catholics and unite Ireland. From 1969 until 1998, there was constant fighting (The Troubles) between the Provisional IRA and the UK Army.

In 1998, Irish voters approved the Belfast Agreement, or Good Friday Agreement, which meant they agreed that Northern Ireland would stay in the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland could join the Republic of Ireland if more than half of voters wanted to. The agreement also created councils where ministers from both parts of Ireland worked together. Northern Ireland got a new government in 1998.

During most of the 20th century (1900-1999), the Republic of Ireland was over 90% Catholic. The people and the government were socially conservative. Divorce, contraceptives, and abortions were not allowed until the late 20th century. In 1927 the Republic of Ireland government created the Electricity Supply Board to manage electricity. By the 1960s, 80% of rural families had electricity. The Single Electricity Market was created in 2007 to supply all of Ireland.

The Republic of Ireland and the UK joined the European Economic Community, which became the European Union (EU), in 1973. In the 1990s, the Republic of Ireland became part of the European Single Market. People are allowed to travel and sell things between countries in the European Single Market. In the late 20th century the economy grew quickly, and changed from mostly farming to mostly services and industry. The UK, including Northern Ireland, left the European Union in 2020, but the UK and the Republic of Ireland agreed not to control border crossings.

In 1844, Tennessee Democrat James K Polk, a Jackson protege, was elected president. By the late 1850s, Tennessee, a slave-state, was dominated by Democrats. In 1856, in fact, the antislavery Republican party was not even on the ballot in Tennessee.

Tennessee seceded from the Union along with 10 other southern states, in 1861. It was one of the last states to do so. It was quickly recaptured by the Union.

Cong. Andrew Johnson, D-TN, was named governor of Tennessee by President Lincoln. In 1864, Lincoln chose Johnson (a Tennessean) as his running mate for President.

In 1868 he became the first US President to be impeached, and his removal from office failed by just one vote.

Following the Civil War, the thousands of slaves in Tennessee were liberated, and due to the 15th Amendment given the right to vote. However, around that same period, the Klu Klux Klan was founded in Tennessee. It, along with other such groups, suppressed many African-Americans from voting. Although Democrats initially controlled Tennessean politics, their grasp was not as strong as it was throughout the rest of the south, and by the 20th century, Tennessee was more of a swing state.

Democrats have lost the majority the once had in Tennessee.

In 2000, the Democrats nominated for president, Al Gore. If elected Gore would have been the fourth Tennessean Democrat to be president. But Gore lost the Electoral College very narrowly. He would have won it had he won his home state of Tennessee: Tennessee supported the Republican candidate, George W Bush. The election was a surefire sign Tennessee was growing more and more conservative.

In 2016 Tennessee again showed how conservative it had grown when it voted for Republican Donald Trump by 26 percent.

Democrats hold just 28 of the 99 seats in the Tennessee House. Their leader is Karen Camper.

Democrats control just seven of the 33 seats in the Tennessee Senate. One of these seven members, and the leader of Democrats, is Jeff Yarbro.

Tennessee has nine seats in the United States House of Representatives. Of these, just two are held by Democrats. These Democrats are: Steve Cohen, and Jim Cooper.

Democrats last held a majority of the Tennessee seats in the US House in 2009. In 2010 Republicans won a majority, and have kept it to date.

Neither of the two US Senate seats from Tennessee is held by Democrats.


Souls (series)

The game is very similar to its prequel, but there were also many changes made.


"Dark Souls" became successful and FromSoftware made two sequels and three spiritual successors, "Bloodborne," , and Elden Ring. The game became so popular that other video game companies made high difficulty action RPG's similar to "Dark Souls". 

Oxygen therapy

Oxygen therapy, also called supplemental oxygen, is when oxygen gas (O) is used for medical treatment by giving the gas to the patient for inhalation. It can be used for ilnesses like hypoxia, carbon monoxide toxicity, and cluster headaches. It can be used over a long time for people who suffer with illnesses that lower oxygen levels in the blood like COPD and cystic fibrosis. It can be given in a few different ways such as through a nasal cannula, face mask, or inside a hyperbaric chamber. Oxygen levels need to be high enough for respiration to keep a patient healthy and for normal cell metabolism.

Demon's Souls

Demon's Souls is an action RPG on the Playstation 3 video game console made by Hidetaka Miyazaki and FromSoftware. It is the first game in the "Souls" series of video games. It is known for being a very hard game. Its difficulty was liked and disliked by many people. The gameplay has some similar features to FromSfotware's earlier game, "King's Field," like exploring for armor and weapons, having a high difficulty, and having timing-based fighting, but it is different because "Demon's Souls" has a third-person point of view.

The idea of the game was created some time before the game came out, but many workers in FromSoftware did not think the game would be popular. However, when Miyazaki began working for From, he picked up the project and made "Demon's Souls" into a game. Since From was a little-known video game developer and they thought the game would not sell well anyway, From had a lot of freedom of making the game they wanted to make, as they did not have to remove a lot of features to please video game publishers. Surprisingly, "Demon's Souls" sold many more copies and became much more popular than From thought. It would be popular enough to make three sequels and two spiritual successors, "Bloodborne" and .

Hidetaka Miyazaki

After university, Miyazaki would be an account manager for the US company Oracle Corporation until he was 29. This was because after playing the game "Ico", he decided to quit his job to become a game designer. Due to his age and lack of experience, very few companies would hire him. However, he got a job from FromSoftware and became the leading designer for some of the "Armored Core" games. While FromSoftware had ideas for "Demon's Souls", the idea was put away because no one thought the game would be popular. However, Miyazaki liked the idea and lead the development team.

VRML

VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language, pronounced "vermal", or by its initials, known before 1995 as Virtual Reality Markup Language) is a standard 3-dimensional (3D) interactive vector graphics file format designed for the World Wide Web. It has been succeeded by X3D.

VRML uses text files. The vertices, edges, surface colors, UV-mapped textures, shininess, transparency and more of a 3D polygon can be specified. Graphical components can be made to fetch web pages or other VRML files from the Internet from URLs when the user clicks on the graphical component. Animations, sounds, lighting, and other things about the virtual world can interact with the user or can happen when external events say so, such as timers. A special Script Node allows program code (such as program code in Java or ECMAScript) to be added to a VRML file.

VRML files are commonly called "worlds" and have the .wrl extension (for example, a VRML file can be called island.wrl). VRML files are in plain text and usually compress well using gzip, which is useful to transfer them over the Internet faster (some files compressed using gzip use the .wrz extension). Many 3D modeling programs can save objects and scenes in VRML format.

The Web3D Consortium was started to develop the format further. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) have made VRML and its successor, X3D, international standards.

The first version of VRML was specified in November 1994. It was specified from, and looked a lot like, the API and file format of the Open Inventor software component, originally developed by SGI. The development of version 2.0 was guided by the ad-hoc VRML Architecture Group (VAG). A working draft was published in August 1996. Formal collaboration between the VAG and SC24 of ISO began in 1996, and VRML 2.0 was submitted to ISO to be used as an international standard. The current and functionally complete version is VRML97 (ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997). X3D (ISO/IEC 19775-1) has succeeded VRML.

Dave Raggett created the term VRML in a paper he wrote called “Extending WWW to support Platform Independent Virtual Reality”, which was submitted to the First World Wide Web Conference in 1994, and first discussed at the WWW94 VRML BOF, which Tim Berners-Lee started. There, Mark Pesce showed the Labyrinth demo he developed with Tony Parisi and Peter Kennard. VRML was introduced to a wider audience in the SIGGRAPH Course, VRML: Using 3D to Surf the Web in August 1995. In October 1995, at Internet World, Template Graphics Software (TGS) demonstrated a 3D/VRML plug-in for the beta release of Netscape 2.0 by Netscape Communications.

In 1997, a new version of VRML, VRML97 (also known as VRML2 or VRML 2.0), was finalized, and became an ISO standard. VRML97 was used on the Internet on some personal homepages and sites, such as "CyberTown", which used Blaxxun Software to allow 3D chat to be possible. SGI's Cosmo Software supported the format. When SGI restructured in 1998, the division was sold to the VREAM Division of Platinum Technology, which was then taken over by Computer Associates, which did not develop or distribute the software. Because of that, various proprietary Web 3D formats came out over the next few years, including Microsoft Chrome and Adobe Atmosphere, neither of which is supported today. VRML's capabilities were mostly the same while realtime 3D graphics kept improving. The VRML Consortium changed its name to the Web3D Consortium, and began work on the successor to VRML, which is X3D.

SGI ran a web site at vrml.sgi.com that hosted a string of regular short performances of a character called "Floops", who was a VRML character in a VRML world. A company called "Protozoa" created Floops.

H-Anim is a standard for animated Humanoids, which is based around VRML, and later X3D. The first version of the H-Anim standard, 1.0, was supposed to be submitted at the end of March 1998.

VRML never saw much serious widespread use, possibly because most users, such as business users and personal users, had low bandwidth and slow dial-up Internet access.

VRML was mostly experimented with in education and research, where an open specification is most valued. It has now been developed into X3D. The MPEG-4 Interactive Profile (ISO/IEC 14496) was based on VRML (now on X3D), and X3D is largely backwards-compatible with it. VRML is also widely used as a file format to distribute 3D models, mostly from CAD systems.

A free version of VRML for multiple platforms called OpenVRML is available. Its libraries can be used to add both VRML and X3D support to applications, and a GTK+ plugin that allows VRML/X3D worlds to be rendered in web browsers is available.

In the 2000s, many companies, such as Bitmanagement, improved the quality level of virtual effects in VRML to the quality level of DirectX 9.0c using proprietary solutions. All main features like game modeling are already complete. They include multi-pass render with low level setting for Z-buffer, BlendOp, AlphaOp, Stencil, Multi-texture, Shader with HLSL and GLSL support, realtime Render To Texture, Multi Render Target (MRT) and PostProcessing. Many demos show VRML supports lightmap, normalmap, SSAO, CSM and Realtime Environment Reflection and other virtual effects.

Wuhan Institute of Virology

The Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (WIV) is a research institute. It was designed to study virology. It is run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The institute is in Jiangxia District, Wuhan, Hubei. It opened China's first biosafety level 4 (BSL–4) laboratory in 2015.

In January 2020, conspiracy theories spread which said that the COVID-19 pandemic came from a virus made by the WIV. But scientific evidence says that the virus is natural. One story in the "Washington Post" said that US State Department had raised safety concerns about WIV's research on bat coronaviruses in 2018. In April 2020, U.S. intelligence officials looked into reports the virus may have started by an accident by WIV scientists studying bats.

Experts do not believe the virus escaped from the institute. One expert said that up to seven million people in Southeast Asia are infected each year with bat coronaviruses. He said there are probably only about six people who work with the viruses at the institute. It does not make sense that virus came from one of these of people compared with the millions of other people affected by bats. The staff at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were trained at US labs and follow high safety standards. The evidence shows that this is not a laboratory accident.

The WIV started in 1956 as the Wuhan Microbiology Laboratory under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). In 1961, it became the South China Institute of Microbiology, and in 1962 was renamed Wuhan Microbiology Institute. In June 1978 it was named Wuhan Institute of Virology.

In 2015, the WIV's National Bio-safety Laboratory was completed at a cost of 300 million yuan ($44 million). It was built with help from the French government's CIRI lab. Some of the money to build the laboratory was given by the U.S. government. 

In 2005, a group including researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology published research into the origin of the SARS coronavirus. They found China's horseshoe bats have a lot of SARS-like coronaviruses. Scientists took samples from thousands of horseshoe bats in locations across China, and found over 300 bat coronaviruses.

In 2015, an international team including two scientists from the Institute made a hybrid virus, combining a bat coronavirus with a SARS virus. The SARS virus had been changed to grow in mice and copy human disease. The hybrid virus was able to infect human cells.

In 2017, a team from the Institute found that coronaviruses from horseshoe bats at a cave in Yunnan had all the genetic pieces of the SARS virus. They said this could be the source, and that the human SARS virus probably came from this cave. The team studied the bats for five years. They said there was a village only a kilometer away, and because of this there was the risk of another bat virus like SARS affecting people.

In December 2019, cases of pneumonia linked with an unknown coronavirus were reported to health authorities in Wuhan. The Institute checked its coronavirus collection and found the new virus was 96 percent identical to a sample its researchers had taken from horseshoe bats in southwest China.

A team at the Institute were the first to identify, analyze and name the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). They made it available for scientists around the world to study.

They have large wings compared to their size, and the shape of the wings means they are able to make quick, tight turns at slow speeds.(p361) 

They get their common name from their large noses (nose-leafs), which are shaped like horseshoes.

Bats live for six or seven years, but one greater horseshoe bat lived more than 30 years.

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) both said it was bad that it had taken so long. The McMichaels are both white.

The McMichaels and William Bryan had their first hearing at Glynn County Magistrate Court on June 4, 2020. They appeared by video instead of in person because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Judge Wallace E. Harrell said there was enough evidence for all three men to go to trial. 

On June 24, 2020, District Attorney Holmes told the public that a grand jury had indicted all three men on nine crimes: one count each of malice murder (intentional murder), false imprisonment, criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment, two counts of aggravated assault and four counts of felony murder. The highest possible punishment for these crimes is life in prison without parole.

On July 17, all three men pleaded not guilty. Chatham County Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley decided not to release William Bryan on bail because he was worried Bryan would run away. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation also investigated Bryan for sex crimes.

On November 13, a judge denied bail for Gregory and Travis McMichaels. This means they stayed in jail until their trial. They could not return home or prepare for their trial outside of jail.

On February 23, Prosecutor George E. Barnhill wrote a letter to the Glynn County police saying he thought the police should not arrest the McMichaels. He said they had been in "hot pursuit" of Arbery, that they had a good reason to believe Arbery had committed a crime, and had told him out loud to stop running. In Georgia, it is legal for ordinary people to stop and hold a suspected criminal until the police arrive.

As of mid-May, four district attorneys had worked on this case one after the other. Because Gregory McMichael had worked as a police officer and worked for the Brunswick district attorney's office, it was difficult to find a district attorney who could charge McMichael with a crime. In the United States, prosecutors are not allowed to prosecute people they know, only strangers. The first two, Jackie Johnson and George E. Barnhill, both recused themselves, meaning they willingly left the case, because they or someone they knew had worked with one Gregory McMichael.

The third prosecutor to work on the case, Tom Durden, came from Georgia's Atlantic Judicial Circuit. On May 5, he asked the Georgia Board of Investigation to find the facts. Durden decided to begin criminal processes against the McMichaels later that week.

On May 7, 2020, Gregory and Travis McMichael were arrested and brought to a Georgia jail. They were charged with felony murder and aggravated assault.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the state of Georgia decided not to have any more grand juries until June 2020. In the United States, a grand jury decides whether a suspected criminal should have a trial. They decide this by looking at the evidence to see if there is enough. If they say yes, the suspects have a trial. If they say no, the suspects go free.

On May 11, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr put district attorney Joyette M. Holmes on the case. She was the fourth district attorney to work on the Ahmaud Arbery shooting case.

Travis McMichael hired the lawyers Bob Rubin and Jason Sheffield and Gregory McMichael hired Laura Hogue and Frank Hogue. Both sets of lawyers asked the public not to make decisions too soon.

Before recusing himself, Barnhill said it is legal in Georgia for the McMichaels to take their guns and chase someone if they believe that person is a criminal trying to escape being caught, but the crime must be a felony, or large crime. It is also legal for them to defend themselves if that person attacks them.

The law reads: "A private person may arrest an offender if the offense is committed in his presence or within his immediate knowledge. If the offense is a felony and the offender is escaping or attempting to escape, a private person may arrest him upon reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion." This is called a citizen's arrest law.

Gregory McMichael said that he and his son chased Arbery because he looked like a thief from a string of break-ins that had happened nearby, but the local police said that there had not been a string of break-ins.

If Arbery entered a house but left without stealing anything or harming anyone, then he might be guilty of trespassing, which is a misdemeanor crime, or small crime, but not a felony crime.

The video that appeared May 5 was filmed from a moving car or truck that was following the McMichaels' white truck. The video shows a black man running on the right side of the truck. Then he crosses in front of the truck and cannot be seen. Then there is some kind of fight, and three gunshots. Then the black man falls to the ground.

William "Roddy" Bryan recorded the video. He gave a copy to the police and then gave a copy to a lawyer named Alan Tucker. Tucker later gave the video to the radio station WGIG. The people at WGIG said it was from an anonymous source.

On May 8, Alan Tucker said he was the one who gave the video to the radio station. The McMichaels had talked to Tucker about Tucker working as their lawyer, which he later decided not to do because he knew Gregory McMichael from his work. Tucker said he gave the video to WGIG so people could see exactly what happened. "It wasn't two men with a Confederate flag in the back of a truck going down the road and shooting a jogger in the back. It got the truth out there as to what you could see," said Tucker. "My purpose was not to exonerate them or convict them."

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation began to investigate William Bryan. A lawyer for Arbery's family said that Bryan must have been helping the McMichaels chase Arbery. In a police report made the day of the shooting, Gregory McMichael told a Glynn County police officer that Bryan had tried to stop Arbery from running away from them. In late May, Bryan was arrested and charged with criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment and felony murder. Under U.S. law, that means that if Bryan was helping the McMichaels commit a serious crime, then deaths that happened during that crime are Bryan's fault as well, even if he did not shoot anyone himself.
In May, another video taken on February 23 was released to the public. It showed Arbery entering a house under construction, looking around, and leaving. The man who owned the house, Larry English, told CNN that nothing had been stolen.

On May 8, thousands of people ran 2.23 miles (2 for the month of February and .23 for the 23rd day of February, the date Arbery died). May 8 is Arbery's birthday, and he would have turned 26 years old if he had not died. Many of the runners posted the hashtag #IRunWithMaud on social media. Jason Vaughn and Akeem Baker invented the hashtag. Vaughn was the running coach at Arbery's high school and Baker was Arbery's friend. They both said Arbery was an excellent runner and racer.

In June, at the same time as the George Floyd protests, the Georgia NAACP planned a March on Georgia. Thousands of people marched to the Georgia state capitol building to stop police brutality. The marchers also said they were marching because Georgia had made it harder for black people to vote by closing so many voting places that the ones that were left had very long lines, because they think Georgia's citizens arrest laws are unfair, because of the killings of Rayshard Brooks, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. The Georgia citizens arrest law is what the McMichaels claim made it legal for them to chase and try to stop Arbery.

The state of Georgia performed an autopsy on Ahmaud Arbery's body. They found he had been shot twice in the chest and once on his wrist and had not taken any drugs or alcohol. The autopsy report said Arbery had died in a homicide, meaning a killing of one human by other humans.

On June 24, after the shooting but before any trials, the Georgia State Senate passed a law against hate crimes. Many American states already had hate crime laws, but Georgia did not. Hate crime laws make it a separate, additional crime to harm someone because of what group they belong to or look like they belong to.

The court cannot use the Georgia state hate crime law in the Arbery case because it was made after the crime happened. The United States does not allow ex post facto laws. That is, it does not allow anyone to be punished for something that was not a crime when they did it.

The United States' federal government has its own hate crime law. The three men are charged with hate crimes "on the federal level." That means that the hate crime trials are being run by the main government of the country, not by the state of Georgia.

At first, no date was set for the trials of Arbery's killers. This was because of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. McMichael, McMichael and Bryan waited for their trials in jail. On October 18, 2021, jury selection for the trial began. The jury would have eleven white people and one black person. The trial lasted about two weeks. Lawyers for the three men said that they were only protecting their neighborhood. They said the accused men thought Arbery was dangerous. Travis McMichael got on the stand and spoke to the jury, saying he shot Arbery in self-defense. On November 24, the jury found all three men guilty on most of the counts, including felony murder.

Judge Timothy R. Walmsley gave the sentences (punishments) on January 7, 2022. Travis and Gregory McMichael were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. William Bryan was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole. Bryan must be in prison for 30 years before he may ask for parole.

All three men are allowed to appeal, to ask the State of Georgia to change or stop their punishments at the Georgia Supreme Court. All three men are also to go on trial at the federal level.

On January 31, 2022, Travis McMichael offered to plead guilty to federal hate crimes. In exchange, lawyers for the government said he could spend the first 30 years of his sentence in a federal prison, then go to a Georgia state prison. However, Judge Lisa Godbey Wood of the U.S. District Court said no. It is very unusual for a judge to refuse a plea deal that prosecutors have made with a defendant. This means McMichael would go on trial for hate crimes.

On February 22, 2022, a jury said all three men were guilty of federal hate crimes.

Micropigmentation

Micropigmentation is how tattoos can look like makeup such as eyelining and adding colors to the skin of the face, lips, and eyelids. Micropigmentation is can also make artificial eyebrows for people who lost them because of old age or disease. Micropigmentation can also hide scars and white spots in the skin such as in vitiligo.

Khichdi

Khichdi (), is a dish from the Indian subcontinent made from rice and lentils ("dal"), but other variations include "bajra" and mung "dal kichri". In Indian culture, it is considered one of the first solid foods that babies eat. Kichri is a salty porridge. The Anglo-Indian dish Kedgeree is thought to derive from khichri. India has designated it as the "National dish", as it is being globally promoted by the Government of India as "Queen of all Foods".

Richard Jantz

Richard Jantz is an American Anthropologist. He focused on fields such as forensic anthropology, genetics, and also organized existing information in databases. He has written over 100 published articles, and his research has led the fields of physical and forensic anthropology. Jantz is currently a professor for the Department of Anthropology at the University of Tennessee. 

Richard Jantz grew up in central Kansas, and went to Kansas University. At school, he found that his strengths lay in statistical analysis. 

Jantz's recent research involves measuring the differences in bone size and shape between different Native American tribes. In this research, he challenged work done by Franz Boas, a founder of modern anthropology. The original study, done by Boas in the early 1900s, showed that children born in America had bones closer to other American adults, and children born in Europe had bones closer to those of other Europeans. In 2002, Jantz did his own study to test Boas' findings. He writes that he found no significant difference between the bones of American and European children, but his study receives criticism from many other anthropologists. 

A well-respected anthropologist, Jonathan Marks, said that Jantz's new research "has the ring of desperation to it (if not obfuscation), and has been quickly rebutted by more mainstream biological anthropology." Later, other anthropologists also looked back over Boas' study and found that he was actually correct. 

Richard Jantz has also worked to advance scientific methods of determining sex based on bone shape. He has worked with many Native American remains to organize data in large computer databases. 

Jantz played a large role in the discovery and legal battle over a prehistoric skeleton called the Kennewick Man, suing the government to get more access to it for research. He argued that since the skeleton was radiocarbon dated to about 9,000 years old, no modern-day Native American tribes could really claim the skeletons as their own under the NAGPRA law. 

He worked to identify the crew of a confederate shipwreck found near South Carolina, and was part of a reexamination of the Nikumaroro bones to determine if they could have belonged to Amelia Earhart.

Condorcet method

A Condorcet method (; ) is one of many election methods that elects the candidate that is preferred by more voters than their opponent in every head-to-head election against each of the other candidates, whenever there is such a candidate. This candidate, known as the "pairwise champion" or "beats-all winner", is formally called the "Condorcet winner".

A Condorcet winner might not always exist in a particular election because the preference of a group of voters selecting from more than two options can possibly be cyclic — that is, it is possible (but very rare) that every candidate has an opponent that defeats them in a two-candidate contest. (This is similar to the game rock paper scissors, where each hand shape wins against only one opponent and loses to another). The possibility of such cyclic preferences in a group of voters is known as the Condorcet paradox. However, there always exists a smallest group of candidates that beats all candidates not in the group, known as the Smith set, which is guaranteed to only have the Condorcet winner in it when one exists; many Condorcet methods always elect a candidate who is in the Smith set when there is no Condorcet winner, and are thus said to be "Smith-efficient". The Condorcet winner is also usually but not necessarily the utilitarian winner (the one which maximizes social welfare).

Condorcet voting methods are named for the 18th-century French mathematician and philosopher Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas Caritat, the Marquis de Condorcet, who championed such voting systems. However, Ramon Llull devised the earliest known Condorcet method in 1299. It always elects the same candidate as Copeland's method in cases with no pairwise ties.

Condorcet methods usually use preferential (ranked) voting, though they can be done with separate rounds of runoff elections.

Most Condorcet methods have a single round of preferential voting, in which each voter ranks the candidates from most preferred (marked as number 1) to least preferred (marked with a higher number). A voter's ranking is often called their "order of preference." The votes can be tallied in many ways to find a winner. Some - the Condorcet methods - will elect the Condorcet winner if there is one. They can also elect a winner when there is no Condorcet winner, and different Condorcet-compliant methods may elect different winners in the case of a cycle.

The procedure given in Robert's Rules of Order for voting on motions and amendments is also a Condorcet method, even though the voters do not vote by ranking the candidates. There are multiple rounds of voting, and in each round the vote is between two of the alternatives. The loser (by majority rule) of a pairing is eliminated, and the winner of a pairing is paired in a later round against another alternative. Eventually only one alternative remains, and it is the winner. This is similar to a single-winner or round-robin tournament; the total number of pairings is one less than the number of alternatives. Since a Condorcet winner will win by majority rule in each of its pairings, it will never be eliminated by Robert's Rules. But this method cannot reveal a voting paradox in which there is no Condorcet winner and a majority prefer an early loser over the eventual winner (though it will always elect someone in the Smith set). A lot of the literature on social choice theory is about this method since it is widely used and is used by important organizations (legislatures, councils, committees, etc.). It is not practical for use in public elections, however, since its multiple rounds of voting would be very expensive for voters, for candidates, and for governments.

In a competition between candidates A and B where voters have ranked the candidates, if more voters mark their ballots that they prefer candidate A over candidate B than the number of voters who mark their ballots to the contrary, then Candidate B is not (supposed to be) elected.

However, because of the possibility of the Condorcet paradox, it is possible, but unlikely, that this can't be done. This is sometimes called a "Condorcet cycle" or just "cycle" and can be thought of as Candidate Rock beating Candidate Scissors, Candidate Scissors beating Candidate Paper, and Candidate Paper beating Candidate Rock. If there is no cycle (and no ties), all Condorcet methods elect the same candidate.


For most Condorcet methods, the pairwise counts are all that is necessary to figure out who won, who came in 2nd place, etc. and can be used to figure out if there is a Condorcet winner, and who it is.

A Condorcet method is a voting system that will always elect the Condorcet winner (if there is one); this is the candidate whom more voters prefer to each other candidate, when compared to them one at a time. This candidate can be found by checking if there is a candidate who beats all other candidates; this can be done by using Copeland's method and then checking if the Copeland winner has the highest possible Copeland score.

Note that there are ½"N"("N"−1) pairwise comparisons for "N" candidates. For 10 candidates, this means there are 0.5*10*9=45 comparisons, which can make elections with many candidates hard to count the votes for.

In some situations, an election has no Condorcet winner. This occurs as a result of a kind of tie known as a "majority rule cycle", described by Condorcet's paradox. Different Condorcet methods pick different winners in these situations. Some Condorcet methods involve the basic procedure described below, coupled with a Condorcet completion method, which is used to find a winner when there is no Condorcet winner. Other Condorcet methods involve an entirely different system of counting, but are classified as Condorcet methods because they will still elect the Condorcet winner if there is one.

It is important to note that not all single winner, ranked voting systems are Condorcet methods. For example, instant-runoff voting and the Borda count are not Condorcet methods.

In any Condorcet method that passes Independence of Smith-dominated alternatives, it can sometimes help to identify the Smith set from the head-to-head matchups, and eliminate all candidates not in the set before doing the procedure for that Condorcet method.

Condorcet methods use pairwise counting. For each possible pair of candidates, one pairwise count indicates how many voters prefer one of the paired candidates over the other candidate, and another pairwise count indicates how many voters have the opposite preference. The counts for all possible pairs of candidates show all the pairwise preferences of all the voters.

Pairwise counts are often displayed in a "pairwise comparison matrix" or "outranking matrix" such as those below. In these matrices, each row represents each candidate as a 'runner', while each column represents each candidate as an 'opponent'. The cells at the intersection of rows and columns each show the result of a particular pairwise comparison. Cells comparing a candidate to themselves are left blank.

Imagine there is an election between four candidates: A, B, C and D. The first matrix below records the preferences expressed on a single ballot paper, in which the voter's preferences are (B, C, A, D); that is, the voter ranked B first, C second, A third, and D fourth. In the matrix a '1' indicates that the runner is preferred on this voter's ballot over the 'opponent', while a '0' indicates that the runner is defeated. For example, in the following matrix, A beats D:

Using a matrix like the one above, one can find the overall results of an election. Each ballot can be transformed into this style of matrix, and then added to all other ballot matrices using matrix addition. The sum of all ballots in an election is called the sum matrix.

Suppose that in the imaginary election there are two other voters. Their preferences are (D, A, C, B) and (A, C, B, D). Added to the first voter, these ballots would give the following sum matrix:

When the sum matrix is found, the contest between each pair of candidates is considered. The number of votes for runner over opponent (runner,opponent) is compared with the number of votes for opponent over runner (opponent,runner) to find the Condorcet winner. In the sum matrix above, A is the Condorcet winner because A beats every other candidate. When there is no Condorcet winner, many Condorcet completion methods, such as Ranked Pairs and the Schulze method, use the information contained in the sum matrix to choose a winner.

Cells marked '—' in the matrices above have a numerical value of '0', but a dash is used since candidates are never preferred to themselves. The first matrix, that represents a single ballot, is inversely symmetric: (runner,opponent) is ¬(opponent,runner). Or (runner,opponent) + (opponent,runner) = 1. The sum matrix has this property: (runner,opponent) + (opponent,runner) = N for N voters, if all runners were fully ranked by each voter.

Imagine that Tennessee is having an election on the location of its capital. The population of Tennessee is concentrated around its four major cities, which are spread throughout the state. For this example, suppose that the entire electorate lives in these four cities and that everyone wants to live as near to the capital as possible.

The candidates for the capital are:


The preferences of the voters would be divided like this:

To find the Condorcet winner every candidate must be matched against every other candidate in a series of one-on-one contests. In each pairing the winner is the candidate preferred by a majority of voters. The results for every possible pairing are as follows:

The results can also be shown in the form of a matrix:

As can be seen from both of the tables above, Nashville beats every other candidate. This means that Nashville is the Condorcet winner. So Nashville would win an election held under any Condorcet method.

While any Condorcet method will elect Nashville as the winner, first-past-the-post and instant-runoff voting would select Memphis and Knoxville respectively, using the same ballots. This would occur despite the fact that most people would have preferred Nashville to either of those options. Condorcet methods make these preferences obvious rather than ignoring or discarding them.

On the other hand, note that in this example Chattanooga also defeats Knoxville and Memphis when paired against those cities. If Memphis voters had preferred Chattanooga as a second choice rather than as a third choice, then Chattanooga would be the Condorcet winner even though finishing in last place in a first-past-the-post election.

An alternative way of thinking about this example if a Smith-efficient Condorcet method that passes ISDA is used to determine the winner is that 58% of the voters, a mutual majority, ranked Memphis last (making Memphis the majority loser and Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville above Memphis, ruling Memphis out. At that point, the voters who preferred Memphis as their 1st choice could only help to choose a winner among Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville, and because they all preferred Nashville as their 1st choice among those three, Nashville would've had a 68% majority of 1st choices among the remaining candidates and won as the majority's 1st choice.

Some Condorcet methods first do a series of pairwise comparisons and then, if there is no Condorcet winner, use an entirely different, non-Condorcet method to determine a winner. The simplest such fall-back methods completely ignore the results of the pairwise comparisons. For example, the Black method chooses the Condorcet winner if it exists, but uses the Borda count instead if there is a cycle (the method is named for Duncan Black).

A more complex two-stage process is, when there is a cycle, to first eliminate all candidates not in some group which is found by looking at the pairwise comparisons, and then use a separate voting system to find the winner. Sets used for this purpose are defined so that they will always contain only the Condorcet winner if there is one, and will always, in any case, contain at least one candidate. Such sets include the


Some Condorcet methods use a single procedure that meets the Condorcet criteria and, without any extra procedure, also pick winners when there are cycles. In other words, these methods do not involve separate procedures for different situations. Typically these methods base their calculations on pairwise counts. These methods include:


Some Condorcet methods produce not just a single winner, but a ranking of all candidates from first to last place. A Condorcet ranking is a list of candidates with the property that the Condorcet winner (if one exists) comes first and the Condorcet loser (if one exists) comes last, and the same holds for the candidates ranked between them.

Methods that satisfy this property include:


Though there won't always be a Condorcet winner or Condorcet loser, there is always a Smith set and "Smith loser set" (smallest group of candidates who lose to all candidates not in the set in head-to-head elections). Some voting methods produce rankings that sort all candidates in the Smith set above all others, and all candidates in the Smith loser set below all others, with this also applying to all candidates ranked between them. Because the Smith set and Smith loser set are equivalent to the Condorcet winner and Condorcet loser when they exist, methods that always produce Smith set rankings also always produce Condorcet rankings.

Many proponents of instant-runoff voting (IRV) are attracted by the belief that if their first choice does not win, their vote will be given to their second choice; if their second choice does not win, their vote will be given to their third choice, etc. This sounds perfect, but it is not true for every voter with IRV. If someone voted for a strong candidate, and their 2nd and 3rd choices are eliminated before their first choice is eliminated, IRV gives their vote to their 4th choice candidate, not their 2nd choice. Condorcet voting takes all rankings into account simultaneously, but this makes it fail the later-no-harm criterion and the later-no-help criterion. With IRV, indicating a second choice will never hurt your first choice. With Condorcet voting, it is possible that indicating a second choice will cause your first choice to lose.

Plurality voting is simple, and theoretically provides incentives for voters to compromise for centrist candidates rather than throw away their votes on candidates who can't win. Opponents to plurality voting point out that voters often vote for the lesser of evils because they heard on the news that those two are the only two with a chance of winning, not necessarily because those two are the two good compromise candidates. This gives the media significant election powers. Condorcet runs each candidate against the other head to head, so that voters elect the candidate who would win the most sincere runoffs, instead of the one they thought they had to vote for.

There are circumstances, as in the examples above, when both instant-runoff voting and the 'first-past-the-post' plurality system wouldn't elect the Condorcet winner. (In fact, FPTP can elect the Condorcet loser and IRV can elect the second-worst candidate, who would lose to every candidate except the Condorcet loser.) When there is a Condorcet winner that IRV doesn't elect, a majority would by definition prefer the Condorcet Winner to the IRV winner. Supporters of the Condorcet criterion see it as an important criterion when choosing a voting method. They see the Condorcet criterion as a natural extension of majority rule. Condorcet methods tend to encourage the selection of broadly supported candidates who appeal to the median voter. Here is an example that is designed to support IRV while making Condorcet look bad:

499 A>B>C

3 B>C>A

498 C>B>A

B is preferred by a 501–499 majority to A, and by a 502–498 majority to C. So, according to the Condorcet criterion, B should win, despite the fact that very few voters rank B in first place. By contrast, IRV elects C and plurality elects A. The goal of a ranked voting system is for voters to be able to vote sincerely and trust the system to protect their intent.

The importance of this scenario, of two parties with strong support, and the one with weak support being the Condorcet winner, may be less than one would expect, though, as it is common in plurality voting systems (see Duverger's law), but much less likely to occur in Condorcet or IRV elections, which unlike Plurality voting, punish candidates who are opposed by a significant block of voters.

Here is an example that is designed to support Condorcet while making IRV look bad:

33 A>B>C

16 B>A>C

16 B>C>A

35 C>B>A

B would win against either A or C by more than a 65–35 margin in a one-on-one election, but IRV eliminates B first, leaving a contest between the more "polar" candidates, A and C. Proponents of plurality voting state that their system is simpler than any other and more easily understood.

All three systems are susceptible to tactical voting, but the types of strategy used and how often there is value in voting strategically differ in each method.

Like all voting methods, Condorcet methods are vulnerable to compromising. That is, voters can help avoid the election of a less-preferred candidate by insincerely (strategically) raising the position of a more-preferred candidate on their ballot. However, Condorcet methods are only vulnerable to compromising when there is a majority rule cycle, or when one can be created.

All Condorcet methods are at least somewhat vulnerable to burying. That is, voters can sometimes help a more-preferred candidate by strategically lowering the ranking of a less-preferred candidate on their ballot.

Scholars of electoral systems often compare them using mathematically defined voting system criteria. The criteria which Condorcet methods satisfy vary from one Condorcet method to another. However, the Condorcet criterion implies the majority criterion, and thus is incompatible with independence of irrelevant alternatives (though it implies a weaker analagous form of the criterion: when there is a Condorcet winner, losing candidates can drop out of the election without changing the result), later-no-harm, the participation criterion, and the consistency criterion.

Condorcet methods are not known to be currently in use in government elections anywhere in the world, but a Condorcet method known as Nanson's method was used in city elections in the U.S. town of Marquette, Michigan in the 1920s, and today Condorcet methods are used by a number of private organizations. Organizations which currently use some variant of the Condorcet method are:







Smith set

In voting systems, the Smith set, named after John H. Smith, but also known as the top cycle, or as Generalized Top-Choice Assumption (GETCHA), is the smallest non-empty set of candidates in an election such that more voters prefer any candidate in the set over any candidate not in the set in head-to-head matchups. The Smith set is one way to determine who the best candidates in an election are. Voting systems that always elect a candidate from the Smith set pass the Smith criterion and are said to be "Smith-efficient".

A set of candidates where every candidate in the set pairwise beats every candidate not in the set is known as a dominating set.


The Smith set can be calculated with the Floyd–Warshall algorithm in time Θformula_1. It can also be calculated using a version of Kosaraju's algorithm or Tarjan's algorithm in time Θformula_2.

It can also be found by ordering the candidates by their number of pairwise victories minus pairwise defeats (a Copeland method ranking), and then looking for the smallest group of candidates, starting from the top, who pairwise beat all candidates not already in the group.
Example using the Copeland ranking:

A pairwise loses to C, so it is certain that all candidates from A through C (A, B, and C) are in the Smith set. However, there is one matchup where a candidate who is known to be in the Smith set loses or ties someone who may or may not be in the Smith set: C loses to D; so D is confirmed to be in the Smith set. Another such matchup can now be seen: D ties with E. So E is added into the Smith set. Because all of A through E beat all candidates other than each other, the Smith set is A through E.

Pairwise comparison

Pairwise comparison is any process of comparing things in pairs to judge which of two things is preferred, or has a greater amount of some something, or whether or not the two things are identical. The method of pairwise comparison is used in the scientific study of preferences, attitudes, voting systems, social choice, public choice, requirements engineering and multiagent AI systems. In psychology literature, it is often referred to as paired comparison.

If someone shows what they like more between two options, this preference can be expressed as a pairwise comparison. If the two alternatives are "x" and "y", these three pairwise comparisons are possible:

The person prefers "x" over "y": ""x" > "y"" or ""xPy""

The person prefers "y" over "x": ""y" > "x"" or ""yPx""

The person has no preference between both alternatives: ""x" = "y"" or ""xIy""

It is generally assumed that pairwise comparisons are transitive. Most agree on what transitivity is, though there is debate about the transitivity of indifference. The rules of transitivity are as follows.


This is linked to (xPy or xIy) being a total preorder, P being the related strict weak order, and I being the related equivalence relation.

Some believe that indifference (lack of preference) is not transitive. Consider the following example. Suppose you like apples and you prefer apples that are larger. Now suppose there exists an apple A, an apple B, and an apple C that are the same except for the following. Suppose B is larger than A, but it is not possible to see this without an extremely sensitive measuring device. Also suppose C is larger than B, but this also can't be seen without a sensitive measuring device. However, the difference in sizes between apples A and C is large enough that you can see it. In psychophysical terms, the size difference between A and C is above the just noticeable difference ('jnd') while the size differences between A and B and B and C are below the jnd.

You are confronted with the three apples in pairs without a sensitive measuring device. Because of this, when shown only A and B, you have no preference between apple A and apple B; and you are indifferent between apple B and apple C when shown only B and C. However, when the pair A and C are shown, you prefer C over A.

If pairwise comparisons are transitive by the four rules shown above, then pairwise comparisons for a list of alternatives ("A", "A", "A", ..., "A", and "A") can take the form:

For example, if there are three alternatives "a", "b", and "c", then the 13 possible preference orders are:


If the number of alternatives is n, and indifference is not allowed, then the number of possible preference orders for any given "n"-value is "n"<nowiki>!</nowiki>. If indifference is allowed, then the number of possible preference orders is the number of total preorders. It can be expressed as a function of n:

where "S"("n", "k") is the Stirling number of the second kind.

Irish Home Rule

Irish Home Rule was a proposed system of government in Ireland, in which Ireland would have its own government inside the United Kingdom. Until 1920, Ireland was ruled directly by the British government. British members of parliament tried to pass bills for Home Rule in 1886, 1893, and 1912, but they never got enough votes to pass. Irish Nationalists supported Home Rule, and Irish Unionists opposed it.

The 1886 bill was supported by the Liberal Party, but did not get enough votes in the House of Commons. The 1893 bill got enough votes to pass in the House of Commons, but not the House of Lords. William Gladstone was an important supporter of both. The 1912 bill also passed in the House of Commons, but not the House of Lords. In 1912, Unionists in Ulster signed a document called the Ulster Covenant, and made an army called the Ulster Volunteers, to fight against Home Rule.

Although many Nationalists wanted Home Rule, some thought it was not good enough. Most members of the party Sinn Féin wanted Ireland to be completely separate from Great Britain. Sinn Féin became the most powerful party in 1916 and made their own government in Dublin, the Dáil Éireann. Irish Nationalists fought in the Irish War of Independence against the British government from 1919-1921. In 1920, Britain passed a law that said there would be two parliaments, one for Northern Ireland, and one for Southern Ireland. This was a form of Home Rule. However, the Southern Ireland parliament never met. The war did not end until the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, which created the Irish Free State. The Irish Free State still had the same king as Britain, but had a separate government.


Frinkcoin

"Frinkcoin" is the 13th episode of the 31st season of "The Simpsons". It was first shown on television in the United States on the Fox network on February 23, 2020. In the episode, Professor Frink makes a new cryptocurrency. The episode was watched by 1.84 million people when it was first shown on television.

The Simpson family are eating at a vegan restaurant, wanting Lisa to pick them for a project at school. She chooses Professor Frink because he wants to help the world with science. At Springfield University, Lisa interviews Professor Frink. Frink says he is making a new cryptocurrency called Frinkcoin.

Frinkcoin becomes well known, making Frink the richest man in Springfield. Mr. Burns is angry because he is no longer the richest man in Springfield. Frink feels lonely, so Marge says that he should go to Moe's Tavern. Frink gets every question correct in Moe's trivia questions, so they become friends with Frink. Frink shows his friends Springfield's best places. Smithers gets a team of people to create a cryptocurrency for Mr. Burns. The team creates an equation to make Frinkcoin worth nothing, but it will take thousands of years to calculate. Instead, Mr. Burns tells Frink that his friends only like him because he is rich.

Burns brings the equation to Springfield for a crowdsourcing solution. Frink finds out that his friends only like him because he is rich. Frink solves the equation himself, but only Lisa knows. Frink loses all of his money, but he is happy to be friends with Lisa and to go back to his university. 

Dennis Perkins of "The A.V. Club" gave the episode a score of B and says that the episode "uses the cryptocurrency concept as an excuse for a largely successful exercise in side-character development." "Den of Geek" gave the episode a 4 out of 5 stars and says "'Frinkcoin' is a satisfying episode" and that Lisa and Frink's actions add up to a "solid half hour investment."

Sachiko Honda

Sachiko Honda (本田幸子, December 30, 1930 - May 1st, 2020) is a female 8-dan Japanese professional Go player at Nihon Ki-in.

The Mukai sisters (Kozue, Chiaki, Kaori) are her pupils, and all of them are professional players. She also has two sisters: Kazuko Sugiuchi (Older sister, mentor of Tomoko Kato) and Teruko Kusunoki (Younger sister), both of them are professional players.

Majority criterion

The majority criterion is a single-winner voting system criterion, used to compare these systems. The criterion says that "if one candidate is liked more by a majority (more than 50%) of voters than all other candidates, then that candidate must win".

Some voting methods that pass this criterion include any Condorcet method, instant-runoff voting, Bucklin voting, and plurality voting.

Supporters of other voting systems say that the majority criterion is actually bad, since it can lead to a tyranny of the majority where a candidate is elected who is loved by a little over half of the population and hated by everyone else. Other systems may be better at electing consensus candidates who have broader support, which is argued to make them better representatives of the population as a whole. These are described as "utilitarian" or "consensus-seeking" rather than "majoritarian". Peter Emerson supports Borda count variants, and believes that majority rule is fundamentally flawed and leads to problems such as bitterness, division, and violence, citing Northern Ireland and Bosnia as examples. Note however that in a utilitarian system, when no broadly supported candidate exists, that a minority can beat a majority because their candidate had slightly more support; because of this, utilitarian methods may not always increase consensus.

The mutual majority criterion is a more broad form of the majority criterion which allows a majority to prefer multiple candidates over all of the other candidates, rather than only one; voting methods which pass the majority criterion but fail mutual majority can encourage all but one of the majority's preferred candidates to exit the election so that one of the majority-preferred candidates wins, creating a spoiler effect. The common choose-one First-past-the-post voting method is notable for this, because major political parties often attempt to prevent more than one of their candidates from running and splitting the vote, by using primary elections.

The majority criterion says that a candidate X should win if a majority of voters say "Yes" to the question 'Do you like X more than every other candidate?'.

The Condorcet criterion is stronger. It says that a candidate X should win if for every other candidate Y, more voters agree that they prefer X over Y than the number of voters who prefer Y to X.

Satisfaction of the Condorcet criterion implies that of the majority criterion, but not vice versa. With the Condorcet criterion there may be different majorities depending on who X and Y are, but the majority criterion only applies when there is a single majority which has X as their first choice, preferred over every other candidate.


Proportionality for Solid Coalitions

Proportionality for Solid Coalitions (PSC) is a voting system criterion for ranked voting systems. It is important for giving proportional representation for voters in multiple-winner ranked voting systems.

A group of voters formula_1 is a "solid coalition" for a group of candidates formula_2, if every voter in formula_1 ranks every candidate in formula_2 ahead of every candidate that is not in formula_2.

Let formula_6 be the number of voters, formula_7 be the number of seats to be filled and formula_8 be some positive number.

formula_7–PSC is based on the Hare quota formula_11. If formula_1 is a solid coalition for formula_2 and the number of voters in formula_1 is at least formula_8 Hare quotas, then at least formula_8 candidates from formula_2 must be elected (if formula_2 has less than formula_8 candidates at all, then all of them have to be elected). This criterion was created by Michael Dummett.

formula_20–PSC is defined like formula_7–PSC, but is based on the Hagenbach-Bischoff quota formula_23 instead of the Hare quota, and the number of voters in formula_1 must exceed formula_8 Hagenbach-Bischoff quotas. It is a more general form of the majority criterion because it allows for groups of supported candidates (solid coalitions) instead of just one candidate, and there may be more than one candidate that will be elected. Because some authors call the fraction formula_23 a Droop quota, formula_20–PSC is also known as the Droop proportionality criterion.

Droop proportionality means that a majority-size solid coalition will always be able to elect at least half of the seats. This is because a majority is always over n/2 voters, and that will contain half of the Hagenbach-Bischoff quotas (There are (k+1) Hagenbach-Bischoff quotas in an election, since (n/(k+1)) * (k+1) = n, so (k+1)/2, which is half of the quotas * n/(k+1), which is the quota, = n/2).

Cleansing of the Temple

The cleansing of the Temple narrative tells of Jesus making people who sold animals leave the temple in Jerusalem. These people provided animals used in the Jewish rituals of sacrifice. Jesus also drove out the money changers. The temple required that only special coins be used to buy the animals or donate to the temple. Sometimes they were corrupt and cheated people who came to worship. Jesus says they are turning the Temple into "a den of thieves". 

The Synoptic Gospels tell of this happening near the end of Jesus' life. It was one of the reasons that the Jewish leaders opposed Jesus. The Gospel of John puts it near the beginning of the three year ministry of Jesus. This makes some Bible scholars think this happened two times and others think it refers to a single time.

Loei province

Loei (Thai: เลย, ), is one of the least populated provinces ("changwat") of Thailand. It is in upper northeastern Thailand, also called Isan. Neighboring provinces are (from east clockwise) Nong Khai, Udon Thani, Nongbua Lamphu, Khon Kaen, Phetchabun, Phitsanulok. In the north it borders Xaignabouli and Vientiane Province of Laos.

, the provincial governor is Chaiwat Chuenkosum. The province was given 225.6 million baht in the FY2019 Thailand budget.

Tradition says that Loei was created by people from Chiang Saen, the capital of Lan Na. Khun Pha Muang created the village of Dan-kwa, and Bang Klang Hao created Dan Sai. Drought and disease later made to the people move to the site of present-day Loei. In 1907 King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) created the Loei Province. The Loei Cultural Centre (ศูนย์วัฒนธรรมจังหวัดเลย) shows Loei's history, religions, and traditions.

The land has many mountains. The seat of provincial government, Loei, is in a fertile basin where mountains are all around it. The most famous mountains in the province are Phu Kradueng, Phu Luang, and Phu Ruea. The Loei River, which flows through the province, is a tributary of the Mekong, which creates part of the northern border of the province with neighboring Laos. Phu Thap Buek, the tallest mountain of the Phetchabun Range, is in the province.

The mountain Phu Kradueng is in Phu Kradueng National Park (อุทยานแห่งชาติภูกระดึง).

The western part of the province reaches the southern end of the Luang Prabang Range mountain area of the Thai highlands.

Agriculture is an important part of Loei's economy. Macadamia nuts, passion fruit, and Arabica coffee are grown in the highlands; bananas, sesame, and rubber are grown on the plains. Loei is a popular place for tourists who want to look at the environment. This is because of Loei's natural environment and amalgam of northern and northeastern cultures.

Wang Saphung District has a big open pit gold mine that employs many people. The area has been the place of a long-standing disagreement as well as fights between the people of Ban Na Nong Bong and its environs and Tungkum Limited, a subsidiary of Tongkah Harbour PCL. Tungkum's gold mining work has been accused of environmental destruction in the courts.

The province is divided into 14 districts ("amphoe"). The districts are further divided into 89 subdistricts ("tambons") and 839 villages ("mubans").

As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Loei Provincial Administration Organisation ("ongkan borihan suan changwat") and 29 municipal ("thesaban") areas in the province.

Katyn massacre

The Katyn massacre is the name of a series of killings by the Soviet army during World War II. Members of the NKVD killed nearly 22,000 Polish prisoners of war in a forest near Katyn, about from Smolensk. Most of the prisoners killed were officers. The Katyn massacre happened in April and May 1940. Stalin ordered it on Beria's advice. In April 1990, the Soviet Union/Russia admitted it was responsible. In 1990, Mikhail Gorbachev officially apologised. The Katyn massacre is one in a series of similar massacres where up to 100,000 people were killed. Between 400 and 450 prisoners survived. People used their stories to change Soviet history books after the apology. 

In the 1980s, Michail Gorbachev said that Beria and Vsevolod Merkulov were responsible. He said that the Katyn massacre was one of Stalin's atrocities. 

Beria was accused of treason. He was executed in 1953. Merkulov was also executed in 1953 for being close to Beria. Beria and Merkulov were never tried for what they did at Katyn.

Lombards

The Lombards were a Germanic people who ruled most of the Italian Peninsula from 568 to 774. They themselves thought that they had originally come from southern Scandinavia. In ancient times they had worshiped nature, but later the worshiped Odin. They grew long beards in honor of Odin and became known as "Longobards" which means "long beards".

In about 560 A.D., Audoin, who was their leader and a warrior, was succeeded by his son Alboin, a young and energetic leader. He defeated some neighboring tribes and then, in the spring of 568, Alboin led the Lombard migration into Italy. According to the "History of the Lombards," "Then the Langobards, having left Pannonia, hastened to take possession of Italy with their wives and children and all their goods."

When they came to Italy, most of the Lombards still followed their old religion, but some were Arian Christians. Most of them later adopted Orthodox Christian views. In later years they fought with the Franks and later the Muslims. The Normans also fought with them between 1017 and 1078 A.D. As a result, Italy consisted of many small states until modern times.

Condorcet loser criterion

In single-winner voting system theory, the Condorcet loser criterion (CLC) is used to compare different voting systems. Any voting system that passes the CLC will also pass the majority loser criterion.

A voting system that passes the Condorcet loser criterion will never allow a "Condorcet loser" to win. A Condorcet loser is a candidate who would lose a head-to-head competition against each other candidate. (Not all elections will have a Condorcet loser since it is possible for every candidate to lose against at least one other candidate head-to-head.)

Any voting method that passes the Smith criterion will also pass the Condorcet loser criterion, because the Condorcet loser doesn't pairwise beat anyone, and so could not be in the Smith set.

Voting methods that pass include: two-round system, instant-runoff voting (AV), contingent vote, borda count, Schulze method, ranked pairs, and Kemeny-Young method. Any voting method that ends in a runoff passes the criterion, because the Condorcet loser will lose in any head-to-head competition.

Voting methods that don't pass include: plurality voting, supplementary voting, Sri Lankan contingent voting, approval voting, range voting, Bucklin voting and minimax Condorcet.


Mutual majority criterion

The mutual majority criterion is a criterion used to compare voting systems. It is also known as the majority criterion for solid coalitions and the generalized majority criterion. The criterion says that if a majority of voters like a group of candidates more than all of the other candidates, then one of the candidates in the group must win. This is similar to but but more broad than the majority criterion, where the group of candidates can only have one candidate in it. The Droop proportionality criterion is a more broad form of the mutual majority criterion, which also applies to multi-winner elections.

The Schulze method, ranked pairs, instant-runoff voting, Nanson's method, and Bucklin voting pass this criterion. All Smith-efficient Condorcet methods pass the mutual majority criterion.

The plurality vote, approval voting, range voting, the Borda count, and minimax fail this criterion.

Voting methods which pass the majority criterion but fail mutual majority can have a spoiler effect, since if a minority-preferred candidate wins, and all of the candidates preferred by the majority, except for one, leave the election, then the remaining majority-preferred candidate will win instead.

King's Privy Council for Canada

The King's Privy Council for Canada (KPC; ; called the Queen's Privy Council for Canada when there is a queen), sometimes called just the Privy Council, is a group of people that help the monarch (king or queen) of Canada. They give advice to the monarch on events related to the government. The monarch or the person that represents them (the Governor General) must follow the advice of a group of people in the Privy Council, called the cabinet, who are usually part of the government and are usually Members of Parliament (MPs). Those who are part of the Privy Council are called "Privy Councillors".

When people join the Privy Council, they become members of it for the rest of their lives. They are chosen by the Governor General based on who the Prime Minister says should be in the council. That causes many of the Privy Councillors to be ex-members of the cabinet. Other Privy Councillors might be people that have important roles, like being the Leader of the Opposition.

Urn

An urn is a vase, often with a cover, with a typically narrowed neck above a rounded body and a footed pedestal. Describing a vessel as an "urn", as opposed to a vase or other terms, generally reflects its use rather than any particular shape or origin. The term is especially often used for funerary urns, vessels used in burials, either to hold the cremated ashes or as grave goods. The history of cremation urns dates back to ancient civilizations. Cremation as a funerary practice has been prevalent in various cultures throughout history. The use of urns for holding cremated remains can be traced to ancient Greece, where elaborate pottery urns were crafted to house the ashes of the deceased. In ancient Rome, urns made of materials such as marble or bronze became popular, showcasing intricate designs and symbols associated with the deceased. Over time, different cultures and time periods have influenced the design and materials used for cremation urns, reflecting the artistic and cultural preferences of each era. Today, cremation urns continue to serve as meaningful vessels for preserving the memory and legacy of loved ones. But it is used in many other contexts; in catering large vessels for serving tea or coffee are often called "tea-urns", even when they are metal cylinders of purely functional design. Large sculpted vases are often called urns, whether placed outdoors, in gardens or as architectural ornaments on buildings, or kept inside.

Judith Quiney

Judith Quiney (baptised 2 February 1585 – 9 February 1662), née Shakespeare, was the younger daughter of William Shakespeare and Anne Hathaway and the fraternal twin of their only son Hamnet Shakespeare. By the time of Judith Quiney's death, she had outlived her children by many years.

On 10 February 1616, Shakespeare’s younger daughter Judith married a local man, Thomas Quiney. At the start of 1616 her impending marriage must have been the cause of celebration in the family. Shakespeare first saw his lawyer to draft his will in January 1616. This is often taken to mean he was already ill, but with his daughters married or betrothed it was also a good time to ensure they would be provided for.Things started to go wrong soon after that first session with the lawyer. In the first drafting of the will, he is mentioned specifically with a bequest “vnto my sonne in L[aw]”. The marriage occurred outside the usual period for marriages (as Shakespeare’s own had been). Anne Hathaway was already pregnant. This wasn’t the case with Judith.Shakespeare’s marriage had been arranged by license from Worcester, but in Judith’s case no license was granted. Marrying without going through the proper procedures was frowned on, and both Judith and Thomas were excommunicated. None of this sounds like respectable behaviour, but worse was to come. Thomas might well have been in a hurry to marry Judith, because after the marriage it soon came out that he had previously had a mistress, Margaret Wheeler, who was pregnant with his child. To make matters worse, both Margaret and her baby died. Thomas was tried by the church court and sentenced to stand in front of the congregation of Holy Trinity church clad in a white sheet, for three Sundays.

Shakespeare saw his lawyer again on 25 March. One of the significant changes is that the reference to Thomas Quiney was struck out and Judith’s name was inserted instead. Judith was to inherit £100, a cottage, and if she or her children were alive after three years a further £150 of which she should receive the interest, giving her and any children she might have an independent income. She also received Shakespeare’s “broad silver gilt bole”. Very little is known about Judith, but her life seems to have been full of disappointments. As far as we know she received no education, and lived in Stratford all her life. She and her twin brother Hamnet were born in 1585, but Hamnet died in August 1596. His death must have affected the whole family profoundly, not least Judith herself. This was the first of many sad events in her life, the next of which was the humiliation surrounding her marriage. She can not have been unaware of the comparison with her older sister Susanna who had already made a successful marriage to a highly-respected doctor and had a daughter. In Shakespeare’s will, it’s Susanna who inherits most of Shakespeare’s wealth including his house New Place.

Shakespeare himself died in April 1616, only a few weeks after Judith’s marriage and humiliation. In November Judith herself had a baby son, who was christened “Shakespeare”, after her father. The baby lived for only six months, dying in May 1617. Infant mortality was high, and several of Shakespeare’s own siblings had died as babies. Later, in 1618 and 1620, Judith had two more sons, Richard and Thomas. These two boys survived childhood but died within weeks of each other in 1639, aged 19 and 21, probably of plague. So Judith outlived all of her children, being buried on 9 February 1662 aged 77, while her husband died in 1662 or 1663. Thomas Quiney was by profession a vintner and tobacconist, and later became a leading member of the town’s governing council, holding its highest office, Chamberlain, in 1621 and 1622. But unlike her sister and brother-in-law who had graves in the chancel of the church, Judith and Thomas were buried in the churchyard, the site is now unknown.The house in which Judith and Thomas Quiney lived still stands, but unlike Susannah’s house Hall’s Croft Shakespeare’s Birthplace or the site of his grand house New Place it isn’t a museum. It used to be known as “The Cage”, and stands in the very centre of town at the junction of High Street and Bridge Street. In its time this building has been a prison, the “Shakespeare View Store”, the town’s Tourist Information Centre and now, a shop selling Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries.

Operations and Checkout Building

The Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building (O&C) (previously known as the Manned Spacecraft Operations Building) is a factory located at Kennedy Space Center.

The building was built in 1964, and made from reinforced concrete and steel.

Its purpose is to make and test out rocket parts such as the Apollo Command/Service Module, Lunar Module, Space Shuttle Spacelab modules, and truss components for the International Space Station. Once manufacturing and check-testing is complete, the spacecraft modules or space stations are checked out of the factory to the SSPF or the Vehicle Assembly Building for integration and launch.

The O&C is actually a two-part building with connected overhead walkways. The front building is where astronauts live in dormitories before launching into space. It also has a few conference rooms, several laboratories, and a restaurant. The rear building is where the spacecraft manufacturing workshop is located.

In 2014, the O&C was named in honor of the first man on the moon: Neil Armstrong.

Pacific Coast League

The Pacific Coast League (PCL) is a Minor League Baseball league based in the Western United States. Like the International League, the PCL plays at the Triple-A (AAA) level, the most difficult level before Major League Baseball (MLB).

The league started in 1903 and was a popular baseball league in the region until 1958 when MLB teams moved there and MLB games began to be shown on television. It was named the Pacific Coast League because it started with only teams from the states of California, Oregon, and Washington, which are next to the Pacific Ocean. After MLB took control of Minor League Baseball in 2021, it was called the Triple-A West for one season before going back to the PCL name in 2022.

Dark-sky preserve

A dark-sky preserve (DSP) is protected area without light pollution created by humans. These areas are used to help promote astronomy. Different countries have different programs for making areas dark-sky preserves. The International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) uses the word "reserve" instead of "park", or "preserve" with their dark-sky preserves. This is so that people don't confuse International Dark Sky Reserves (IDSR) and International Dark Sky Parks (IDSP).

In Canada, there is a very strict way to make areas dark-sky preserves. This was based on the work by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. The program is based on the amount of light in an area and how much skyglow there is from cities and towns that are close to it. Canada's program is the only one in the world that makes areas dark-sky preserves. Outside Canada, when areas are called dark-sky preserves, they are not official, and might not be a real dark or protected preserve.

Schwarzschild metric

The Schwarzschild metric was calculated by Karl Schwarzschild as a solution to Einstein's field equations in 1916. Also known as Schwarzschild solution, it is an equation from general relativity in the field of astrophysics. A "metric" refers to an equation which describes spacetime; in particular, a Schwarzschild metric describes the gravitational field around a Schwarzschild black hole - a non-rotating, spherical black hole with no magnetic field, and where the cosmological constant is zero.

It is essentially an equation that describes how a particle moves through the space near a black hole.

formula_1

Although a more complicated way of calculating the Schwarzschild metric can be found using Christoffel Symbols, it can also be derived using the equations for escape velocity (formula_2), time dilation (dt'), length contraction (dr'):

formula_3 (1)

v is the velocity of the particle 
G is the gravitational constant 
M is the mass of the black hole 
r is how close the particle is to the heavy object

formula_4 (2) 
formula_5 (3)

dt' is the particle's true change in time 
dt is the particle's change in time 
dr' is the true distance traveled 
dr is the particle's change in distance 
v is the velocity of the particle 
c is the speed of light

Note: the true time interval and true distance traveled by the particle are different than the time and distance calculated in classical physics calculations, since it is traveling in such a heavy gravitational field!

Using the equation for flat spacetime in spherical coordinates:
formula_6 (4)

ds is the path of the particle

formula_7 is the angle 
dformula_7 and dformula_9 are the change in angles

Inputting the equations for escape velocity, time dilation, and length contraction (equations 1, 2, and 3) into the equation for flat spacetime (equation 4), to get the 
Schwarzschild metric:

formula_10 (5)

From this equation we can take out the Schwarzschild radius (formula_11), the radius of this black hole. Although this is most commonly used to describe a Schwarzschild black hole, the Schwarzschild radius can be calculated for any heavy object.

formula_12 (6)

formula_13 is the set radius limit of the object

COVID-19 pandemic in the United States

The COVID-19 pandemic spread to the United States in January 2020. The first confirmed case of local transmission was recorded in January in Chicago and the first known deaths happened in February.

By the end of March, cases had happened in all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. territories except American Samoa.

As of , cases of COVID-19 have been reported, and people have died of COVID-19.

As of May 13, 2020, the U.S. had the most confirmed active cases and deaths in the world, and its death rate was 206 per million people, the tenth-highest rate globally.

The Trump administration made a public health emergency on January 31, and on February 2nd he began to end the entry of most foreign nationals who had recently travelled to China. People have said that the country's response to the pandemic was slow regarding testing and medical response.

On February 25, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned the American public for the first time to prepare for a local outbreak.

A national emergency was declared on March 13. In early March, the Food and Drug Administration began allowing public health agencies and private companies to create and carry out tests. The Trump administration waited until mid-March to start purchasing large amounts of medical equipment.

On March 16, the White House announced that they were against any gatherings of more than ten people. Since March 19, 2020, the U.S. Department of State has said all U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel. 

State and local responses to the outbreak have included cancellation of large gatherings, stay-at-home orders, and the closing of schools and other educational institutions. 

Large numbers of outbreaks in the U.S. were seen in black American populations. 

Many numbers of infections and deaths have happened in nursing homes, long-term care facilities, prisons, and other detention centers, meatpacking plants, churches, and larger cities such as New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Seattle.

In July 2020, scientists from Johns Hopkins University told people that deaths from COVID-19 in United States prisons were much higher than the average for the whole country. There were about 3251 sick prisoners and 39 deaths out of every 100,000 prisoners. The national average was about 587 sick United States residents and 29 deaths for every 100,000 United States residents.

COVID-19 pandemic in Spain

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic was first confirmed to have spread to Spain on 31 January 2020, when a German tourist tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in La Gomera, Canary Islands. By 13 March, cases had been confirmed in all 50 provinces of the country.

A state of alarm and national lockdown was made on 14 March. On 29 March it was announced that, beginning the following day, all non-essential workers were to stay home for the next 14 days. By late March, the Community of Madrid had recorded the most cases and deaths in the country. 

On 25 March the death toll in Spain passed that of mainland China, and only Italy's was higher. 

On 2April, 950 people died of the virus in a 24-hour period—at the time, the most by any country in a single day. The next day Spain passed Italy in total cases and was then second only to the United States.

COVID-19 pandemic in Italy

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic was first confirmed to have spread to Italy on 30 January 2020, when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for the virus. 

A large amount of cases was later found, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February, and 60 additional cases and the first deaths on 22 February. By the beginning of March, the virus had spread to all regions of Italy.

On 30 January, the Italian government stopped all flights to and from China and declared a state of emergency. In February, eleven cities in northern Italy were seen as the centres of the two main Italian infected areas and placed under quarantine. The majority of positive cases in other regions traced back to these two areas. 

On 8 March 2020, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte expanded the quarantine to all of Lombardy and 14 other northern provinces, and on the following day to all of Italy were placed on quarantine. On 11 March 2020, Conte prohibited nearly all commercial activity except for supermarkets and pharmacies. 

On 21 March, the Italian government closed all non-essential businesses and industries, and stopped movement of people.

, Italy has 78,457 active cases, one of the highest in the world.
Overall there have been 
222,104 confirmed cases and 
31,106 deaths (a rate of 509 deaths per million population), while there have been 
112,541 recoveries or dismissals. 

By 13 May, Italy had tested about 1,779,000 people. Because of the limited number of tests performed, the real number of infected people in Italy, as in other countries, is seen to be higher than the official count. 

On 19 March, Italy became the country with the highest number of confirmed coronavirus deaths; however, on 11 April, the United States topped Italy.

COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China

The COVID-19 pandemic started with a large number of unknown, possible pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China. A Wuhan hospital told the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019.

On 31 December, the Wuhan CDC told the media that there was a large number of unknown pneumonia cases related to Huanan Seafood Market.

The possible disease outbreak soon became known nationwide including that of the National Health Commission (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day. Chinese authorities notified the World Health Organisation on this same day. On 8 January, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of the pneumonia. 

Public and media criticized Chinese officials for a slow response to fight the outbreak when it first started. By 29 January, the virus spread to all provinces of mainland China. All provinces of mainland China began a large public health emergency. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a "Public Health Emergency of International Concern" on 31 January, saying that there are reasons that it could spread to other countries, such as those without robust healthcare systems. By 8 February, over 724 died from the coronavirus and 34,878 were confirmed to have been infected. In Hubei alone, there were 24,953 cases of infections and 699 related deaths.

The Chinese government may have censored talks about the outbreak since the beginning of its spread. On 25 January, Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping warned about a "grave situation" in China. 

The Chinese New Year celebrations were cancelled. Passengers across the country have been checked for their temperatures. 

By 29 January, all Hubei cities were quarantined. Curfew laws were added in Huanggang, Wenzhou, and other mainland cities. 

In February 2020, the region also saw a huge shortage of face masks and other protective gear even though China called themselves the world's largest makers of these masks. Other countries donated medical supplies to help China deal with the epidemic.

On 25 February, the number of newly confirmed cases outside mainland China passed those from within for the first time. By 6 March the reported number of new cases had dropped to well fewer than 100 nationally per day, down from thousands per day.

"Many human coronaviruses have their origin in bats". The human coronavirus NL63 shared a common ancestor with a bat coronavirus (ARCoV.2) between 1190 and 1449 AD. The human coronavirus 229E shared a common ancestor with a bat coronavirus (GhanaGrp1 Bt CoV) between 1686 and 1800 AD. More recently, alpaca coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E diverged sometime before 1960. 

MERS-CoV emerged in humans from bats through the intermediate host of camels. MERS-CoV, although related to several bat coronavirus species, appears to have diverged from these several centuries ago. 

The most closely related bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV diverged in 1986. The ancestors of SARS-CoV first infected leaf-nose bats; later, they spread to horseshoe bats, then to Asian palm civets, and finally to humans.

Racism among Asians such as Chinese people grew during the pandemic such as criticisms of their markets, lifestyles and food choices. Some rumors say that China made the virus in a lab.

COVID-19 pandemic in Iran

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections on 19 February 2020 in Qom. The virus may have been brought to the country by a merchant from Qom who had travelled to China.

In response to the coronavirus the government cancelled public events and Friday prayers. They closed schools, universities, shopping centres, bazaars, and holy shrines; and banned festival celebrations. 

Economic help were also announced to help families and businesses. The government at first did not support plans to quarantine entire cities and areas. The government later announced a ban on travel between cities following an increase in the number of new cases.

Some outside guesses of the numbers of COVID-19 deaths were much higher than those from government sources, with one saying over 40,000 deaths. The government was also accused of cover-ups, censorship, and not handling the pandemic well. However, the World Health Organization said that it had not seen problems with Iran's reported numbers.

Many government ministers and senior officials have been diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 positive. As of 3 March 2020, 23 members of the Parliament (around 8% of all MPs) tested positive. 

At least 12 sitting or former Iranian politicians and officials had died from the virus by 17 March. 

Some of the well known Iranians reported to have died from COVID-19 include:


COVID-19 pandemic in India

The first case of the COVID-19 pandemic in India was reported on 30 January 2020, originating from China.

The infection rate of COVID-19 in India was reported to be 1.7, which was lower than in the worst affected countries.

The outbreak was called an epidemic in more than a dozen states and union territories.

On 22 March 2020, India made a 14-hour voluntary public curfew at the instance of the prime minister Narendra Modi. The government followed it up with lockdowns in 75 districts where COVID-19 cases had occurred as well as all major cities. On 24 March, the prime minister ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, affecting the entire 1.3billion population of India. On 14 April, the prime minister extended the nationwide lockdown until 3 May.

People worried about the economic effects caused by the lockdown, which has would have on informal workers, micro and small enterprises, farmers and the self-employed.

Observers stated that the lockdown slowed the growth rate of the pandemic by 6 April to a rate of doubling every 6 days, and, by 18 April, to a rate of doubling every 8 days.

The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), in its report based on data from 73 countries, reports that the Indian Government responded more strictly than other countries in the pandemic.

COVID-19 pandemic in Germany

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic spread to Germany on 27 January 2020, when the first case was confirmed near Munich, Bavaria.

The majority of cases in January and early February came from the same automobile-parts business place as the first case. On 25 and 26 February, multiple cases related to the Italian outbreak were found in Baden-Württemberg. A large number linked to a carnival event was formed in Heinsberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, with the first death reported on 9March 2020. New larger groups were found in other regions via Heinsberg as well as by people arriving from China, Iran and Italy, from where non-Germans could arrive by plane until 17–18 March.

The outbreaks were first managed in a "containment stage", which tried to lower the increase of larger infected areas. The German government and several health officials stated the country was ready and did not create special measures to increase medical supplies or limit public freedom. Since 13 March, the pandemic has been managed in the "protection stage". Two days later, borders to five neighboring countries were closed.

By 22 March, all regional governments had announced curfews or restrictions in public spaces. Throughout Germany, travelling was only allowed in groups of two people unless they are from the same household.

Some German states added more restrictions allowing people to leave their homes only for specified activities including commuting to work, exercising or purchasing food.

 173,699 cases had been reported with 7,791 deaths and about 147,200 recoveries. The low fatality rate in Germany, compared to Italy and Spain, resulted in a debate and explanations that say the country's higher number of tests performed, higher number of available intensive care beds with respiratory support, absence of COVID-19 analyses in autopsies and higher proportion of positive cases among younger people.

COVID-19 pandemic in France

The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached France on 24 January 2020, when the first COVID-19 case in both Europe and France was identified in Bordeaux.

The first five confirmed cases were all people who had recently arrived from China. A Chinese tourist who was admitted to hospital in Paris on 28 January died on 14 February, making it the first COVID-19 death in France. The annual assembly of the Christian Open Door Church between 17 and 24 February in Mulhouse which was attended by about 2,500 people was believed where the virus spread throughout France.

On 12 March, French President Emmanuel Macron announced on public television that all schools and all universities would close from Monday 16 March until further notice. The next day, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe banned gatherings of more than 100 people, not including public transport. The following day, the prime minister ordered the closure of all non-essential public places, including restaurants, cafés, cinemas and nightclubs, effective at midnight.

On 16 March, Macron announced mandatory home order for 15 days starting at noon on 17 March. This was extended twice, until 11 May, after which the order would end only if citizens wore face masks.

On 2 May, Olivier Véran announced that the government would seek to extend the health emergency until 24 July. Many mayors were against the 11 May lifting of the lockdown, which had been announced by the President a few weeks earlier in a televised address to the nation, and said it was too soon. Veran's bill was discussed in Senate on 4 May.

, France has reported over 140,734 confirmed cases, 27,074 deaths, and 58,673 recoveries, ranking sixth in number of confirmed cases, passing China where the outbreak began.

COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic spread to the United Kingdom in late January 2020. As of , cases of COVID-19 have been reported, and people have died of COVID-19.
More than 90% of those dying had underlying illnesses or were over 60 years old. The infection rate was higher in care homes than in the community. There were large regional difference in the outbreak's severity. The outbreak in London had the highest total number and the most infections. England and Wales were the UK countries with the highest recorded death rate per head, and Northern Ireland had the lowest.

The Department of Health and Social Care created a public health campaign to help slow the virus's spread, and began posting daily updates in early February. 

In February, the Heath Secretary, Matt Hancock, proposed the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020. Hospitals set up drive-through screening (testing for the disease). The Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, created a four-stage strategy to tackle the outbreak: contain, delay, research and mitigate (help, lessen).

First cases in the United Kingdom were on on 28 February, and by 1March there were cases in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. 

The government created the Coronavirus Action Plan, and said the outbreak a "level 4 incident". 

On 11 March, the outbreak was declared a pandemic. Four days later—following the outbreak in Italy, the government said everyone should avoid all "non-essential" travel and contact with others, avoid crowds, and work from home if possible. Those with symptoms, and their household, were asked to self-isolate. 

Pregnant women, the over 70s, and those with certain illnesses were asked to self-isolate for longer. Panic buying was reported.

On 20 March 2020, the four governments shut all schools, restaurants, pubs, indoor entertainment venues and leisure centres, with some exceptions. On 23 March, the UK government made a lockdown on the whole population, banning all "non-essential" travel and contact with people outside one's home and shutting almost all businesses, venues, facilities, amenities and places of worship. 

People were told to keep apart in public. Police were given the power to enforce the lockdown, and the Coronavirus Act 2020 gave the government emergency powers not used since the Second World War.

More lockdowns took place in October, November and December 2020. Different places had different rules. A national lockdown in England began on 5 January 2021.

It is said that the lockdown will severely damage the UK economy, lead to millions of job losses, worsen mental health and suicide rates, and cause "collateral" deaths due to isolation, delays and falling living standards. 

Researchers suggest the lockdown could be lifted by shielding only the most vulnerable and using contact tracing.

Some schools stayed open to teach the children of essential workers, at-risk children, and children with special education needs. However, adults who work for disabled students' rights told Parliament that British educators had unfairly sent special education students home without good reasons.

Starting with the most at risk, the UK vaccinations is going in this order:

COVID-19 pandemic in Canada

The COVID-19 pandemic in Canada is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 () caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (). 

The disease was confirmed to have reached Canada on January 27, 2020, after a man who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive. , there have been over 134,000 confirmed cases, 118,000 recoveries and 9,000 deaths in the country. The Government of Canada said that around 11,000–22,000 deaths could happen over the course of the pandemic.

Most of those cases are in Canada's most populous provinces, Ontario (19,598 cases, 1,540 deaths) and Quebec (36,150 cases, 2,725 deaths). 

Confirmed cases have been reported in all of Canada's provinces and territories. An additional 13 cases involve citizens from the "Grand Princess" cruise ship. 

Among the Canadians who contracted the virus was Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, wife of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who tested positive for the virus on March 12 after which the family went into self-isolation. By March 28, she had recovered. 

Until March 2020, all cases were linked to recent travel to a country with a large number of cases. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on March 5, and Toronto's chief health officer announced on March 16 that there is "some evidence of community transmission" (that the disease was spreading within the country).

In mid March, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada's provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories made school and daycare shutdown, ended on gatherings, closed non-essential businesses, restrictions on entry, and mandatory self-isolation for travellers. 

Canada severely restricted its border access.

COVID-19 pandemic in Ecuador

The COVID-19 pandemic was reported to have spread to Ecuador on 29 February 2020. That was when a woman in her 70s tested positive for the virus. Ecuador was described in April as the growing "epicentre" of the pandemic in Latin America. 

The city of Guayaquil had so many deaths that bodies were left in the street. Ecuador gave out cardboard coffins because the country had difficulty removing all the dead bodies. The government was planning to build emergency cemeteries to dispose of the bodies which are left in the streets.

In April 2021, newly elected President Guillermo Lasso said that his main priorities after being inaugurated would be to increase the COVID-19 vaccination rates in the country. Lassos said he aim for bilateral talks with Russia, China, the United States, the European Union and Chile to try to acquire vaccines.

The number of deaths was believed to be higher than the official figure because not enough testing was being done. A "New York Times" analysis found 7,600 more deaths had happened from 1 March to 15 April as the mortality rate spiked to three times as much as usual. That showed that the official death toll was lower than the actual death toll.

COVID-19 pandemic in Russia

The COVID-19 pandemic spread to Russia on 31 January 2020, when two Chinese tourists in Tyumen, Siberia and Chita, Russian Far East tested positive for the virus, with both cases being contained.

Early prevention measures happened within the first cases. They included restricting the border with China and large testing. The infection spread from Italy on 2 March, leading to more measures such as cancelling events, closing schools, theatres and museums, shutting the border, and declaring a non-working period which lasted up to 11 May, having been extended twice.

By the end of March, lockdowns were added in the large majority of federal subjects, including Moscow. By 17 April, cases were confirmed in all federal areas. On 27 April, the number of confirmed cases passed those in China and on 30 April, it passed 100,000.

As of 14 May, Russia has 252,245 confirmed cases, 53,530 recoveries, 2,305 deaths, and over 6.1 million tests performed, ranking second in number of confirmed cases. The city of Moscow is currently the most affected, having the majority of confirmed cases.

COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico

The COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached Mexico in February 2020. However, the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) reported two cases of COVID-19 in mid-January 2020 in the states of Nayarit and Tabasco, one case per state.

As of May 13, there had been 40,186 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mexico and 4,220 reported deaths, although the Secretariat of Health said in early May 2020 that there were more than 104,562 cases in Mexico.

On January 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a large group of people in Wuhan, Hubei, China, which was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019.

On January 22, 2020, the Secretariat of Health issued a statement saying that the novel coronavirus COVID-19 was not a threat to Mexico. 441 cases had been confirmed in China, Thailand, South Korea, and the United States. A travel warning was issued on January 9.

On February 28, Mexico confirmed its first three cases. A 35-year-old man and a 59-year-old man in Mexico City and a 41-year-old man in the northern state of Sinaloa tested positive and were held in isolation at a hospital and a hotel. They had travelled to Bergamo and stayed in Italy for a week in mid-February.

President Andrés Manuel López Obrador did not take the pandemic seriously such as the impact of coronavirus. He said "Pandemics ... won't do anything to us," and criticized the press and the opposition for its reportage.

A poll showed that 63% of Mexicans feared contracting COVID-19 and 25.5% feared dying from it. 28% said they were not willing to stay in their homes. 38.6% believed President López Obrador was handling the situation well, and 37% disapproved.

COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Brazil on 25 February 2020, when a man from São Paulo tested positive for the virus. 

As of 13 May 2020, 188,974 cases have been confirmed in the country, causing 13,149 deaths.

On 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a new coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.

On 17 March, Brazil's first coronavirus-related death was confirmed. At this time, there were 291 confirmed cases in the country. Three days later, State health departments reported almost a thousand confirmed cases across 23 of 26 states and also in the Federal District.

A month after the first confirmed case on February 26, the Ministry of Health reported that Brazil had 2,915 confirmed cases and 77 deaths. On 30 April, Brazil overtook China in number of confirmed cases, passing 87,000.

The pandemic has caused a large difference of responses from federal, state and local governments. On 27 March Brazil announced a temporary ban on foreign air travelers, and most state governors have added quarantines to prevent the spread of the virus. 

Despite the global impact of the virus and guidelines from the World Health Organization, President Jair Bolsonaro says that the risk caused by coronavirus has been exaggerated. State governors have disagreed, causing lockdowns measures in their own states.

On 13 March, President Jair Bolsonaro tested negative for COVID-19. The same day, the Ministry of Health issued a warning recommending Brazilians and foreigners arriving in Brazil to stay in isolation for at least 7 days.

2020 Pacific typhoon season

The 2020 Pacific typhoon season was an event in which typhoons formed in the Pacific Ocean. The season lasts all year, although most tropical cyclones form between May and October. The season's first tropical cyclone formed on May 10, making it the sixth-latest start in the basin on record.

Typhoon Vongfong (Ambo), the season’s first storm, became a Category 3 typhoon and struck the Philippines, causing extensive damages during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The first few months of 2020 were extremely quiet, with no tropical systems developing between the months of January and April. On May 10, the season saw its first tropical system with the development of Ambo, making it the sixth-latest starting season on record, as well as the latest since 2016. Two days later, the system strengthened to the first officially named tropical storm of the season, Vongfong. Vongfong then hit the Philippines at peak intensity, and weakened soon after landfall.

After Vongfong, a month of inactivity ensued, and on June 10, a new tropical depression formed off the coast of Samar, and was named Butchoy by the PAGASA a day later. Butchoy made landfall in the Philippines as the JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for it. It then got upgraded to a tropical storm, and impacted Hong Kong, Macau and parts of China upon landfall.
A low-pressure area near Micronesia slowly organized over the course of a few hours, and developed into a tropical depression soon after. It became the first tropical cyclone to form in the Western Pacific in 2020, and PAGASA named it "Ambo". Favourable sea temperatures, low wind shear and excellent vertical outflow made the system intensify into a tropical storm, then the JMA named it "Vongfong".

Less than a day later, when convection started to rapidly organize around the storm's center, and a well-defined rain band at the northwest side of the storm, JTWC upgraded it to a typhoon. Vongfong made landfall on Samar Island at around 12 PM Philippines Time. It began to weaken because of many landfalls over the Philippines, and emerged into the South China Sea on May 17. It turned north and dissipated due to high wind shear the next day, just south of Taiwan.

On June 10, the JMA began monitoring on a weak tropical depression that had developed to the east of the Philippine island of Samar in Visayas. During the next day, the PAGASA began tracking the system, giving the local name Butchoy. The storm then made its first landfall in Polillo Island in Quezon at 5:30 pm PHT, and making its second landfall in Infanta, Quezon shortly thereafter. Soon after, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the storm. Afterwards, the JTWC officially upgraded Butchoy to a tropical depression, and designated it as 02W. With a favorable environment with low vertical wind shear, moderate equatorial outflow and 30–31 °C sea surface temperatures, Butchoy started to intensify in the South China Sea, becoming a tropical storm and receiving the name Nuri from the JMA later on the same day. Then, PAGASA issued their final warning on Nuri as it exited the Philippine Area of Responsibility. By the next day, Nuri intensified further and subsequently peaked in intensity, with the JMA analyzing the storm's peak winds of 75 kilometres per hour (47 mph). Six hours later, the JTWC upgraded Nuri to a tropical storm. However, later in the same day, the JTWC downgraded Nuri into a tropical depression, citing that the storm has drifted into high vertical wind shear. The JMA followed suit, downgrading Nuri into a depression. The JTWC issued their final warning on Nuri as the storm subsequently made landfall in Yanjiang, China. The JMA followed suit six hours later, issuing their final warning on the system.

The PAGASA issued Tropical Cyclone Signal No. 1 for western Mindanao, southern Luzon, and Visayas on June 11 as Butchoy neared the Philippines. The combination of the system and prevailing southwesterly winds brought showers and thunderstorms across the Philippines. Heavy rainfall in Albay led to the activation of disaster risk management officials and other emergency assets.

Stay-at-home order

A stay-at-home order (North America) or a movement control order (Southeast Asia) is an order from a government to lower/end movements of a population as a mass quarantine move for stopping an epidemic, or pandemic. This is done by ordering residents to stay home except for essential tasks or to work in essential businesses.

In many cases, outdoor activities are allowed. Nonessential businesses are either closed or made to working from home.

In some regions, it has added a curfew or called a shelter-in-place order, but it is not to be confused with a shelter in place situation.

Similar measures have been used around the world, but the term lockdown is used instead.

COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020, when the first case was announced.

The number of confirmed cases increased on 19 February by 20, and on 20 February by 58 or 70, giving a total of 346 confirmed cases on 21 February 2020.

Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha declared a state of emergency, beginning on 26 March. A curfew has been announced, beginning on 3 April 2020.

The Thai government's response to the outbreak was based on surveillance and tracing. Temperature and symptom screening for coronavirus testing was added at international airports, as well as at hospitals for patients with travel or contact history. 

Ads were introduced focused on self-monitoring for at-risk groups, practicing hygiene (especially hand washing), and avoiding crowds (or wearing masks if not possible).

While residents returning from high-risk countries were encouraged to self-quarantine, travel restrictions were not announced until 5 March, when four countries were designated as "disease-infected zones".

The government was criticized for its slow response to the crisis. In early February, in response to concerns over hoarding and price increase of face masks, the government issued price controls. The move failed to prevent shortages among hospitals, and became a scandal. Criticism was also for the slow response to end foreign travel.

On 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019.

By mid-April 2020, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) reported that the growth rate of the pandemic had been "as low as it needs to be", that the curve had flattened and that there would be no peak coming.

By 25 June 2021, the Department of Health had confirmed 270,477 cases and 4,989 deaths; a rate of 54,184 cases per million and 999 deaths per million population.
More than 90% of those that have died were aged over 65, and most also had underlying illnesses or lived in care homes.

Flatten the curve

Flattening the curve is a public health strategy to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic. The curve being flattened is the epidemic curve, a representation of the number of infected people needing health care over time. 

During an epidemic, a health care system can break down when the number of people infected passes the health care system's ability to take care of them. 

Flattening the curve means slowing the spread of the epidemic so that the peak number of people requiring care at a time is reduced, and the health care system does not pass its capacity. 

Flattening the curve relies on techniques such as quarantine, stay at home orders, and social distancing.

COVID-19 pandemic in Uruguay

Arthur Holmes

Arthur Holmes (18901965) was an English geologist. He made two important contributions: the use of radioactive isotopes for dating minerals, and the suggestion that convection currents in the mantle play an important role in continental drift. 

Holmes showed us that thermal convection currents were strong enough to move large land masses, which contributed to Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift or theory of Plate tectonics. Harry H. Hess (19061969) also supported this view.

Holmes was a pioneer of geochronology, and performed the first accurate uranium-lead radiometric dating while an undergraduate in London. This gave a date of of 370 mya to a Devonian rock from Norway. This result was published in 1911, after his graduation in 1910.

V.Flash

The V.Flash (known as V.Smile Pro in Europe; stylized as V.FLASH HOME EDUTAINMENT SYSTEM) is a seventh-generation educational home video game console. It is a spinoff of the V.Smile series of video game consoles and was manufactured and released by VTech. Unlike the V.Smile, the game console uses 3D graphics and is designed for kids aged 5+.

It was revealed at the 2006 London Toy Fair, and came out in September 2006.

Not many games were made for the console because it was not very successful. All games came out in the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, France and Germany, except for of Bratz Fashion Pixiez: The Secret Necklace, which did not come out in the United Kingdom and Germany, Multisports, which was exclusive to Germany, and Scooby-Doo!: Ancient Adventure, which did not come out in Germany.

There are 10 titles known to have been released;


Unlike most other consoles that use CD-ROMs, this system's CD-ROMs are inside a plastic case to protect them from damage from touching, similar to 3.5" floppy disks or UMDs. The discs use the ISO 9660 file system, without any copy protection other than a simple sensor in the case jacket, making it possible to make a disc image from the disc. However, there are no known cases of piracy involving the V.Flash. Because of this, the V.Flash can also play audio CDs and user-recorded CD-Rs using the disc adapter that comes with the console.

The console's CPU is an ARM9 CPU from LSI Logic. Files are stored in 3 main formats: .mjp, .ptx, and .snd. .snd files are actually PCM WAV files.

The console can render 1.5 million polygons per second and has a 32 bit CPU, making the console directly comparable to fifth-generation game consoles, such as the PlayStation.

In 2003 Theatro Technis premiered Justin Butcher`s “The Madness of George Dubya” , reviewed by The Guardian`s Michael Billington “Satire is all but dead on the London stage, so this show by Justin Butcher deserves the warmest of welcomes. Even if it is largely a topical update of Kubrick's Dr Strangelove, it had a packed house at this north London fringe theatre cheering it to the echo.”. The successful run of “The Madness of George Dubya” at Theatro Technis led to its transfer to the Pleasance Theatre in Islington and also garnered support from celebrities such as Justin Hoffman 

In his yearly review of British Theatre Billington remarked “The most cheering aspect of the year was the varied and rapid response to the Iraq crisis. At Theatro Technis, Justin Butcher wrote and directed The Madness of George Dubya - ignored by most critics until it transferred to the West End –“

Sacking of Osceola

The Sacking of Osceola was a Kansas Jayhawker attack to move pro-slavery Southerners at Osceola, Missouri on September 23, 1861. It was not approved by the Union military. The attack happened from an informal group of anti-slavery Kansas "Jayhawkers". The town of 2,077 people was plundered and burned to the ground. 200 slaves were freed and nine local citizens were court-martialed and killed. It was led by James H. Lane.

Lane's raid created hatred that led to William Quantrill's raid on Lawrence, Kansas. That raid led to four counties of western Missouri under General Order No. 11 to be evacuated.


Drumhead court-martial

A drumhead court-martial is a court-martial that happens on the battlefield to hear important charges of crimes that happened during the battle.

The term is said to come from the use of a drumhead as an improvised writing table.

The earliest recorded use is in an English memoir of the Peninsular War (1807). The term sometimes is similar to summary justice. It has an implied lack of judicial neutrality, as noted in the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg of Josef Bühler.

Death by burning

Death by burning (also known as immolation) is an execution method involving combustion or touching to extreme heat. It has a long history as a form of capital punishment, and many societies have used it as punishment for crimes such as treason, heresy and witchcraft. The best known execution of this type is burning at the stake where the condemned is tied to a big wooden stake and a fire lit under them.


James Montgomery (colonel)

James Montgomery (December 22, 1814 – December 6, 1871) was a Jayhawker during Bleeding Kansas. He was also a controversial Union colonel during the American Civil War. Montgomery was a strong supporter of abolitionist ideas and individual liberty, and he used extreme actions against pro-slavery people.

James Montgomery was born on December 22, 1814 in Austinburg, Ashtabula County, Ohio; his parents were James and Mary Baldwin Montgomery. He moved to Kentucky in 1837 with his parents, and he taught school there. He married, but his first wife died shortly after the wedding, so he married again to Clarinda Evans. They moved to Pike County, Missouri in 1852, and then to Jackson County, and finally to Bates County while waiting for Kansas to be open to settlement.

In 1854 Montgomery bought land near present-day Mound City, Kansas. There, he became a leader of local Free-state men and was a strong abolitionist. In 1857 he organized and led a "Self-Protective Company", using it to move pro-slavery people out of the area. Fights with other pro-slavery people led territorial governor James W. Denver to send U.S. Army soldiers in to restore order. Montgomery sometimes worked with the abolitionist John Brown and thought about doing a raid to rescue Brown after his capture in Virginia, but snow in Pennsylvania upset his plan.

On July 24, 1861, Montgomery was hired as a colonel of the 3rd Kansas Infantry of U.S. Senator James H. Lane's Kansas brigade, with Montgomery as second-in-command of the brigade.

After the war, Montgomery went back to his farm in Linn County, Kansas, where he died on December 6, 1871.


Charles R. Jennison

Charles Rainsford Jennison also known as "Doc" Jennison (June 6, 1834 – June 21, 1884) was a member of the anti-slavery group during Bleeding Kansas. He was also a famous Jayhawker, and a member of the Kansas State Senate in the 1870s. He later served as a Union colonel and as a leader of Jayhawker militias during the American Civil War.

Charles R. Jennison was born on June 6, 1834 in Antwerp, Jefferson County, New York. His family moved to Wisconsin in 1846 where Jennison studied medicine. Marrying at 20 years old, Dr. Jennison moved to Osawatomie, Kansas in 1858 and to Mound City, Kansas shortly thereafter. Jennison was considered the most brutal jayhawkers. Whereas some other importnat leaders of irregulars in the Bleeding Kansas border conflict shared these traits, Jennison was different because he plundered for personal gain. Jennison worked with James Montgomery in opposing pro-slavery settlers and irregulars believed to be working with Border Ruffians.

Even before the start of the war, Jennison became a captain of the Mound City Guards on February 19, 1861.

Jennison was elected to the Kansas Legislature from Leavenworth County in 1865, re-elected in 1867, and elected to the Kansas State Senate in 1872. He died at Leavenworth, Kansas June 21, 1884.


George Henry Hoyt

George Henry Hoyt (November 25, 1837 – February 2, 1877) was an abolitionist and attorney for John Brown. During the American Civil War, he served as a Union cavalry officer and captain of the Kansas Red Leg scouts. He became a brevet brigadier general by war's end. Following the war, Hoyt served as the sixth Attorney General of Kansas.

George Henry Hoyt was born in Athol, Massachusetts, on November 25, 1837. He was the only surviving son of Athol physician and abolitionist George Hoyt and his wife Avelina Witt Hoyt. In 1851, the Hoyts moved to Boston, where George studied law. Lysander Spooner, abolitionist anarchist and good friend of Dr. Hoyt, strongly influenced young George's views of abolition, as did radical orator Wendell Phillips.

Hoyt died in Athol on February 2, 1877, aged 39.


William T. Anderson

William T. Anderson (1840 – October 26, 1864), also known as "Bloody Bill" Anderson, was one of the deadliest and most famous pro-Confederate guerrilla leaders in the American Civil War. Anderson led a group of volunteer rangers who attacked Union loyalists and federal soldiers in the states of Missouri and Kansas.

William T. Anderson was born in 1840 in Hopkins County, Kentucky, to William C. and Martha Anderson. His siblings were Jim, Ellis, Mary Ellen, Josephine and Janie. His schoolmates remembered him as a well-behaved, quiet child. During his childhood, Anderson's family moved to Huntsville, Missouri, where his father got a job on a farm, and the family became well-respected. In 1857, they moved to the Kansas Territory, going southwest on the Santa Fe Trail and settling east of Council Grove.

The Anderson family supported slavery, though they did not own slaves. They moved to Kansas most likely for economic rather than political reasons.

Androphilia and gynephilia

Androphilia and gynephilia are terms in behavioral science (the study of human and animal behavior) that describe sexual orientation. It is an alternative to the gender binary in homosexual and heterosexual. Androphilia is attraction to a man or masculinity (any quality or behavior linked to a man). Gynephilia is attraction to a woman or femininity. Ambiphilia (bisexuality) is the combination of androphilia and gynephilia.

The terms describe the focus of attraction with no need to credit a sex assignment or gender identity to the person. It will skirt any difficulty to understand people between the West and the East. The terms will also describe intersex and transgender people.

Magnus Hirschfeld was an early 1900s German sexologist (expert in sex and sexuality). Hirschfeld put a homosexual man in one of four groups. A man with attraction to a boy (pedophile). A man with attraction to an adolescent boy (ephebophile). A man with attraction to another young man (androphile). A man with attraction to an old man (gerontophile).

"Androphilia, A Manifesto: Rejecting the Gay Identity, Reclaiming Masculinity" is a book by Jack Donovan. Donovan uses "androphilia" to focus on masculinity in male homosexual desire. He also uses the term to reject the femininity and androgyny (combination of masculinity and femininity) in some parts of homosexual life.

"Androsexuality" is the same as "androphilia".

Alternative use in biology and medicine

"Androphilic" the same as "anthropophilic" in biology". Anthropophilic" is a parasite who will desire a human more than an animal. "Androphilic" will also describe certain proteins and androgen receptors.

In Ancient Greek, there is a different form of the term. In "Idyll" 8, line 60, Theocritus uses "gynaikophilias" to describe the very strong desire Zeus has for any woman.

Sigmund Freud says "gynecophilic" to describe his case study (detailed study of one person) Dora. Freud also uses the term in writing.

"Gynesexuality" is the same as "gynephilia". Psychoanalyst Nancy Chodorow says the short preoedipal (attraction to the mother and jealousy of the father) time of focus on the mother should be named "gynesexuality" or "matrisexuality."

"Androphilia" and "gynephilia" separate group attraction based on how old a person is. John Money names this chronophilia. Attraction to an adult is teleiophilia or adultophilia. Here, "androphilia" and "gynephilia" mean "attraction to an adult male" and "attraction to an adult female."

Kurt Freund and Betty Steiner create the 9-item Gynephilia Scale and the 13-item Androphilia Scale in 1982. This measures attraction in a mature female or a mature male. In 1985, Ray Blanchard names a new one the Modified Androphilia-Gynephilia Index (MAGI).

Magnus Hirschfeld sorts between gynephilic, bisexual, androphilic, asexual, and automonosexual (sexual attraction to themselves only) transgender woman.

Since the middle of the 1900s, some psychologists like to use "homosexual transsexual" (to mean the same as straight transgender woman) and "heterosexual transsexual" (to mean the same as transgender lesbian). Biologist Bruce Bagemihl is against this. It is because Bageminl thought it makes it simple to say a transsexual is a homosexual male looking to run from stigma. The term "homosexual transsexual" is "heterosexist" because it describes people by sex assignment and not gender identity. Sexologist John Bancroft says he regrets using this language. It was normal at the time Bancroft used it to talk about transgender women. Since 2008, he attempts to use terms that do not hurt the feelings of anyone. Sexologist Charles Allen Moser is also against any terms like that.

Sexologist Militon Diamond supports the terms androphilic, gynecophilic, and ambiphilic to describe any partner a person desires (andro = male, gyneco = female, ambi = both, philic = to love).

Some scientists support use of the terms to skirt bias in concepts of human sexuality in the West. Johanna Schmidt says that in a society where a third gender is supported, a term like "homosexual transsexual" does not line up.

Pofatu Database

The Pofatu Database is a resource for archaeologists and contains contextual and geochemical information on rock material and stone artefacts. This is used by archaeologists to determine the source of the material. In the spring of 2020, the data contained over 7700 samples from sites in the Pacific Ocean region. The samples are from both archaeological sites and geological sites. The geological samples are used for comparison, to identify the source of the archaeological samples. In addition, information on provenience, context, analytical methods and bibliography are maintained. "The database also provides instrumental details, analytical procedures and reference standards used for calibration purposes or quality control." The open-access database is supported by and Max-Planck-Gesellschaft and was built in collaboration with research organizations from Australia, New Zealand, Germany, and the United States.

The database uses an open-source storage system (GitHub) and file formats that are common and non-proprietary.

Chasseur (sauce)

Sauce chasseur, sometimes called "hunter's sauce", is a simple or compound brown sauce used in French cuisine. It is usually made using demi-glace or an espagnole sauce as a base, and often includes mushrooms and shallots. It may also include tomatoes and a finishing of fines herbes. Today, a simplified version of the sauce is produced industrially. This is what most people will associate with 'sauce chasseur'.

Chasseur is named after the French word for "hunter", hinting at the traditional pairings of mushrooms with venison, rabbit, wild fowl, and other game meats. Traditionally, while returning from the hunt, the hunters picked the mushrooms they would use to prepare the game meat.

"Chasseur" is thought to have been invented by Philippe de Mornay, who is also said to have invented Mornay sauce, Béchamel, sauce Lyonnaise and sauce Porto.

Se2grXII

Se2grXII originally marked LXX is a manuscript of the Septuagint dated to the 1st century and written on a parchment in the form of a scroll. This manuscript was found in the Judean Desert, probably in a Nahal Hever cave. This fragment is marked with number 943 on the list of manuscripts of the Septuagint according to the classification of Alfred Rahlfs.

This manuscript was discovered in August 1952 in the Judean Desert by Bedouins, who claimed to be from Wadi Seiyâl, but nobody knows the exact place of origin. It was bought by the Palestine Archaeological Museum (now the Rockefeller Museum). This manuscript received the designation Se2grXII (the second manuscript from the Seiyâl collection, written in Greek, containing a scroll of twelve minor prophets).

Nine other fragments of the scroll of minor prophets were found in 1961 in "Horror Cave" (cave No. 8 in the Nahal Hever Valley) by a team of Israeli archaeologists led by Jigael Jadin. Therefore, cave No. 8 located south of Qumran is now considered to be almost a reliable place of origin for the scroll. All the fragments set has now been given the name Greek Minor Prophets Scroll from Nahal Hever.

This manuscript contains a tetragram in Jonah 3:3.

This manuscript was published by B. Lifschitz from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in the "Israel Exploration Journal" in 1962. The original designation of the manuscript indicates that the Israel Exploration Journal volume XII was published (LXX).

It is stored in the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem (Gr. Se2grXII).

World Snooker Championship

The World Snooker Championship is the leading snooker event both in terms of prestige and prize money. The first event was held in 1927 and was won by Joe Davis. Davis won the first 15 championships before retiring from the event, after his 1946 win. In the 1950s snooker went into a period of decline and the championship was not held after 1952, although an unofficial championship was held until 1957. In 1964 the championship was revived on a "challenge basis" and in 1969 the championship became a knock-out event again. 

Since 1977 it has been played at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. The tournament is currently played over 17 days and ends on the first Monday in May. Since 1969 (the modern era), Ronnie O'Sullivan and Stephen Hendry have won the event most (seven times). Luca Brecel is the current winner.

The 'modern' era is considered to start in 1969, when the championship returned to a knock-out tournament from a challenge format. In the modern game, the best record is that of Stephen Hendry, who won seven times in the 1990s. Steve Davis won six times in the 1980s, as did Ray Reardon in the 1970s.

Basic reproduction number

A very important number for describing whether a disease can become an epidemic or not is R, pronounced "R naught" or "R zero". It refers to how many people a person who has this disease is expected to infect on average if there are no people immune to the disease. It is an abbreviation for basic reproduction number.

If R > 1, a disease can become an epidemic. If R < 1, it cannot. Most commonly known diseases have R > 1. However, vaccines can be used to make enough people immune in a population to stop epidemics from happening. We can also use other measures to make the effective reproduction rate (R, usually written R with "t" for time) lower than the basic reproduction rate (R).

An example of a vaccine that works really well is the smallpox vaccine, which stopped smallpox virus from spreading so well that it no longer exists except in laboratories. Examples of making the effective reproduction rate lower than the basic reproduction rate are using condoms to stop sexually transmitted diseases from spreading or not getting close to others (physical distancing, often called "social distancing") to stop respiratory diseases from spreading.

Idolatry is the worship of an idol or image, being a picture, a statue, or a person in place of God. In Judaism, Christianity and Islam, idolatry means worshiping something that is not God. These religions teach that there is only one God. Idolatry is said to be the "worship of false gods". It is forbidden by religious rules such as the Ten Commandments. There it says, "You shall not make a carved image (as a God)" and "You shall not have any other god ahead of Me (the only God). The monotheistic religions all have such rules.

The strict understanding of these rules would not allow religious statues of any kind. People who hold these views think that such statues should be destroyed. Others would say that worshipers must understand that the statue is only a symbol for God. They say that the image or statue is not the god. This has long been accompanied with violence between religious groups that forbid idol worship and those who have accepted icons, images and idols for worship. In many Indian religions, such as theistic and non-theistic forms of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, idols ("murti") are to be considered as symbolism for the absolute but not The Absolute. In the traditional religions of ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, Africa, Asia, the Americas and elsewhere, the reverence of an image or statue has been a common practice. These statues or images have carried different meanings and significance.

The definition of idolatry has been a contested topic within Abrahamic religions, with many Muslims and Protestant Christians condemning the Catholic veneration of the Virgin Mary as a form of idolatry. This veneration of Mary and other Saints often involves statues. In the Orthodox churches, flat painted images are common, instead of carved statues. These are called Icons.

In history, many religions have accused others of idolatry. These accusations are that statues and images are devoid of symbolism. They say that many people believe the idol, statue or image is a god. Different groups often think that icons or statues in their religion have meaningful symbolism, but another person's religious images do not.

Religious leaders have used the idea of Idolatry (literal worship of statues or images) as a metaphor. They call anything that comes ahead of God an Idol. Saint Paul writes that "covetousness" (wanting material things) is idolatry. Jesus preached that "you cannot serve God and Mammon". Mammon was the Syrian God of riches. Muslim writers warn of making idols of material things or even political ideologies. Eastern religions have also warned about making material things one's god.

"Idolizing" persons, such as rock stars can also be seen as a form of idolatry. The popular TV show "American Idol" seems to use the term in a positive way. But this has been questioned even by non religious persons. Billy Graham has warned against various things that become idols in a person's life.

Avengers: Endgame

Avengers: Endgame is a 2019 American superhero movie based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers. The movie is produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the direct sequel to "" (2018) and the 22nd movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). 

The movie was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with the screenplay written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. It features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. The movie was about how the Avengers tried to fix what Thanos did in "Infinity War" by reclaiming the Infinity Stones throughout time from previously featured MCU characters such as The Ancient One, Jane Foster, Frigga and Red Skull.

"Avengers: Endgame" premiered in Los Angeles on April 22, 2019 and was released in the United States on April 26.

In 2018, twenty-three days after Thanos killed half of all life in the universe, Carol Danvers rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space and they reunite with the remaining Avengers—Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes—and Rocket on Earth. Locating Thanos on an uninhabited planet, they plan to use the Infinity Stones to reverse his actions, but discover Thanos has already destroyed them to prevent further use. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos.

Five years later, in 2023, Scott Lang escapes from the Quantum Realm. Reaching the Avengers Compound, he explains that he experienced only five hours while trapped. Theorizing the Quantum Realm allows time travel, they ask Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse the actions of Thanos in the present. Stark, Rocket, and Banner, who has since merged his intelligence with the Hulk's strength, build a time machine. Banner notes that altering the past does not affect their present; any changes create alternate realities. Banner and Rocket travel to Norway, where they visit the Asgardian refugees' settlement New Asgard and recruit an overweight and despondent Thor. In Tokyo, Romanoff recruits Clint Barton, who became a vigilante after the death of his family.

Banner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark time-travel to New York City during Loki's attack in 2012. At the Sanctum Sanctorum, Banner convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone after promising to return the various Stones to their proper points in time. At Stark Tower, Rogers retrieves the Mind Stone from Hydra sleeper agents, but Stark and Lang's attempt to steal the Space Stone fails, allowing 2012-Loki to escape with it. Rogers and Stark travel to Camp Lehigh in 1970, where Stark obtains an earlier version of the Space Stone and encounters his father, Howard. Rogers steals Pym Particles from Hank Pym to return to the present and spies his lost love, Peggy Carter.

Meanwhile, Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013; Rocket extracts the Reality Stone from Jane Foster, while Thor gets encouragement from his mother, Frigga, and retrieves his old hammer, Mjolnir. Barton, Romanoff, Nebula, and Rhodes travel to 2014; Nebula and Rhodes go to Morag and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill can, while Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir. The Soul Stone's keeper, Red Skull, reveals it can only be acquired by sacrificing a loved one. Romanoff sacrifices herself, allowing Barton to get the Stone. Rhodes and Nebula attempt to return to their own time, but Nebula is incapacitated when her cybernetic implants link with her past self, allowing 2014-Thanos to learn of his future self's success and the Avengers' attempt to undo it. 2014-Thanos sends 2014-Nebula forward in time to prepare for his arrival.

Reuniting in the present, the Avengers place the Stones into a gauntlet that Stark, Banner, and Rocket had built. Banner, having the most resistance to the gamma radiation emitted by the gauntlet, wields it and reverses Thanos's disintegrations. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula, impersonating her future self, uses the time machine to transport 2014-Thanos and his warship to the present, which he then uses to destroy the Avengers Compound. Present-day Nebula convinces 2014-Gamora to betray Thanos, but is unable to convince 2014-Nebula and kills her. Thanos overpowers Stark, Thor, and a Mjolnir-wielding Rogers and summons his army to retrieve the Stones, intent on using them to destroy the universe and create a new one. A restored Stephen Strange arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos's army. Danvers also arrives and destroys Thanos's warship, but Thanos overpowers her and seizes the gauntlet. Stark steals the Stones and uses them to disintegrate Thanos and his army, at the cost of his life.

Following Stark's funeral, Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new ruler of New Asgard and joins the Guardians. Rogers returns the Stones and Mjolnir to their proper timelines and remains in the past to live with Carter. In the present, an elderly Rogers passes his shield to Sam Wilson, in hopes of being the next Captain America.

Candace and Lauren Mead portray "Little Bill" Logan and "Little Ted" Preston; with the characters revealed in "Bill & Ted Face the Music" to be girls, whose full names are shown to be Billie Logan and Thea Preston.

Sadler had been drawn to the role of Death as at the time, he had been cast as a serious villain in numerous films, but had wanted to return to doing comedy as he had done earlier in the Broadway production of "Biloxi Blues". Having enjoyed "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure", he thought the idea of Death as a villain in a comedic film would be a good role for him, auditioning via tape using an accent from Czechoslovakian actor Jan Tříska with whom he had co-performed in an earlier stage production. When he was called in to audition in person, they had asked him to come in aged makeup; Sadler contacted Scott Eddo, the makeup supervisor for "Die Hard 2" to make him look authentically old, which Sadler believed helped get him the role, along with the humor he injected into the audition. Sadler said that in the film, nearly everything Death does was written into the script, outside of the same accent that he used from his audition forward.

The name "Station" was the result of a leftover editing typo, according to the movie's writers Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon. They had cut a scene from the script, labeled "INT. POLICE STATION" but had left the "STATION" part dangling, and as they were drunk at the time, found that saying "Station" in a "[tiny] Martian voice" was hilarious, and the name stuck.

Bangweulu Wetlands

The Bangweulu Wetlands are a wetland area in north-eastern Zambia.

Bangweulu, which means "where the water sky meets the sky", is found mostly within Zambia's Northern Province and known by the Ramsar Convention as one of the world's most important wetlands. The region has flood-plains, seasonally flooded grasslands, woodlands, andswamps, fed by rivers near it.

The ecosystem has "Cyperus papyrus", floating grasses, miombo woodland, and reeds that support a lot of crocodiles, fish, and water birds. Some mammals in the Bangweulu Wetlands are buffalo, zebra, elephants, hippopotamus, hyenas, jackals, lechwe, sable antelope, and sitatunga. Millions of straw-coloured fruit bats go to Bangweulu's Mushitu swamp forest, in Kasanka National Park. In 2016, African Parks partnered with Fondation Segré to help 600 animals, including hartebeest, impala, and puku, into the wetlands.

Bangweulu has been called a "Important Bird Area" by BirdLife International. The wetlands are home to more than 400 bird species, including cormorants, ducks, egrets, Geese, herons, ibises, pygmy goose, and waders. Other animals found in Bangweulu include the great white pelican, saddle-billed stork, spoonbill, and wattled crane.

Bangweulu holds several villages, and around 50,000–90,000 people depend on the wetlands, resulting in human–wildlife conflict. The ecosystem could be damaged by habitat burning for farming, overfishing, and poaching. 75 poachers were arrested in 2010, and 115 were arrested in 2011. The use of mosquito nets for fishing has lessened fish populations in Bangweulu and Zambia.

Head of the Virgin (Pittoni)

Head of the Virgin (also known as La Tête de Vierge or La Testa della Vergine) is a 18th-century portrait painted in oil by Giambattista Pittoni, made around 1730, during the Rococo in Venice, Italy, 
exhibited at the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg. Many people Think Head of the Virgin's eyes glance is mysterious, as at the time it was not portrayed with a low gaze.

The remote pictorial touch, the delicate palette, are typical Pittoni characteristics. The work is the detail of the great painting that can be found in the National Gallery in London titled «The Nativity with God the Father and the Holy Spirit». The painting could be a cover created for sale by Pittoni or a preparatory sketch ("The Croquis") for the altarpiece as for the similar work from Berlin.
The closed eyes that look down, for the time, a unique and rare representation of the Madonna, which is also repeated in the Pittoni The Nativity with God the Father and the Holy Ghost of the London National Gallery museum. 

It is possible that Pittoni looks for further mystical strength in it, exasperating the interpretation of the critic Alexander Nagel on Leonardo da Vinci's "Head of a Woman" in which "the eyes do not focus on any outward object, and they give the impression that they will remain where they are: they see through the filter of an inner state, rather than receive immediate impressions from the outside world. It is the attitude of being suspended in a state of mind beyond specific thoughtunaware, even, of its own body...here an inner life is suggested by a new order of pictorial effects, without recourse to action or narrative."

Interval arithmetic

Interval arithmetic is a specific type of computer arithmetic for (mathematical) intervals. It is mainly used for the automated detection of errors. There is a value, which isn't known exactly, but which can be given by an interval: the value is known to be inside the interval. There's a function to calculate the error. This function should be given the unknown value, but instead can only be given the interval. The result is a function which will map intervals.

Interval arithmetic can be used to treat rounding errors, or to treat insecurities with measurements: Each measurement has a certain error, which cannot be determined exactly.

For real intervals (interval of real numbers), interval arithmetic is defined as follows:

Euler's formula

In complex analysis, Euler's formula, also sometimes called Euler's relation, is an equation involving complex numbers and trigonometric functions. More specifically, it states that

formula_1

where "x" is a real number, "e" is Euler's number and "i" is the imaginary unit.

It makes a relation between trigonometric functions and exponential functions of complex numbers. It is named after Leonhard Euler, who published it in 1748. When he published it, Euler said that the angle must be a real number. Later, it turned out that the formula also works if the angle is not a real number, but a complex one.

When the angle is formula_2 and formula_3, Euler's formula becomes formula_4 and formula_5, respectively.

Numerical methods for partial differential equations

Numerical methods for partial differential equations are computational schemes to obtain approximate solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs).

Many PDEs appeared for the study of physics and other areas in science. Therefore, many mathematicians have challenged to make methods to solve them, but there is no method to mathematically solve PDEs except the Hirota direct method and the inverse scattering method. This is why numerical methods for PDEs are needed.
One of the most basic PDE solver is the finite difference method (FDM). This method approximates derivatives as differences:
This method works for easy problems. But it is powerless to some equations (such as the Navier–Stokes equations) because they are non-linear. Since this difficulty appeared, numerical analysts started to study other methods (just like the finite element method, FEM). On the other hand, some experts started to consider improvements for FDM.

Experts have discovered difference methods which preserves the property of the given PDE.
Ryogo Hirota, Mark Ablowitz and others have made methods that preserves the integrability (important mathematical property in the theory of dynamical systems) of PDEs. These methods are known to have better accuaracy than the original FDM.
Many PDEs have appeared from physics. So we can think about difference methods preserving physical properties. These difference methods are known as structure preserving numerical methods. The following list is the examples of them:
Some experts are studying their relation between numerical linear algebra.
The difference mthods in above have high accuracy, but their usage is limited because they depend on the behaviour of the given PDEs. This is why new types of FDM are still studied. For example, the following methods are studied:

Not only approximate solvers, but the study to "verify the existence of solution by computers" is also active. This study is needed because numerically obtained solutions could be phantom solutions (fake solutions). This kind of incident is already reported.

The scientific journal "Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations" is published to promote the studies of this area.
Chebfun is one of the most famous software in this field. They are also many libraries based on the finite element method such as:


Literatures for specific solvers are described as follows.

Gladys Aylward

Gladys May Aylward (24 February 1902 – 3 January 1970) was a British-born evangelical Christian missionary to China, whose story was told in the book "The Small Woman", by Alan Burgess, published in 1957.

The life of Gladys Aylward was made into the film "The Inn of the Sixth Happiness", starring Ingrid Bergman, in 1958. The film was produced by Twentieth Century Fox, and filmed entirely in North Wales and England. Many things in the film were not true to the life of Gladys. However, it brought her some fame. This allowed her to speak to groups in many countries about her true work and love for Jesus.

Gladys was not accepted by missionary societies due to her lack of education. She saved money for the train fare. She went to China on her own to work with an older woman. After that woman, Jeannie Lawson, died, Gladys took over her work. Much of her life was spent caring for orphans.

Gérard Lamy

Gérard Lamy (2 May 1919 – 26 October 2016) was a Canadian politician. He was a member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of Canada from 1962 to 1963. During this time, he represented the electoral area of Saint-Maurice—Laflèche and was a part of the Social Credit Party. Lamy was born on 2 May 1919 in Shawinigan, Quebec. Before becoming a politician, he was a contractor.

Lamy was only elected one time, in the 1962 federal election. He beat the incumbent Liberal MP, Joseph-Adolphe Richard. Lamy was part of the first group of 26 Social Credit MPs from Quebec who were elected that year. In the election the year after, he lost his election. This was very unexpected, because both Lamy and the Liberal Party thought he would not lose the election. The person that beat him was Liberal Jean Chrétien. Chrétien would later become the Prime Minister of Canada.

Lamy tried to win two more elections after this. In the 1970 Quebec provincial election, he lost his election as a part of the "Ralliement créditiste du Québec". In the 1979 general election, he lost his election as a part of the Progressive Conservative Party. Lamy did not run for election ever again after 1979. He died in Trois-Rivières, Quebec, on 26 October 2016.

Arrowsmith

An is a person to takes on an occupation/role/job that forges the heads of arrows. This is usually brought up in medieval history, as more modern jobs came along, and just a small amount of the population (most of those people working for rural purposes), has the occupation today. The idea of archery was created in 20,000 BC. Like today, people did not use the bow and arrow on a regular basis. But unlike today, they mostly used this new creation for hunting. The first people ever to use it normally was the ancient Egyptians from 4,000 to 2,000 BC. Then the bows started to take a fall in popularity across the world, as gunpowder was invented, along with the cannon. It spread across eurasia, after being invented in China in the third century.

The Transformation of the World: A Global History of the Nineteenth Century

The Transformation of the World: A Global History of the Nineteenth Century by Jürgen Osterhammel, an expert on global history, concentrates on the 19th century, a period when human history was already globally connected.

Osterhammel carefully avoids telling a story of the 19th century. Instead in the beginning he looks at carefully selected aspects 1. the image that people had of themselves at that time, 2. their understanding of time and 3. space.

Looking at self-image and understanding of time, he always sees the 19th century in terms of its characteristic differences from the earlier centuries and the changes that brought about the structures of the 20th century. The sentence "Before the 20th century, not a single year can be seen as epochal for all mankind" (p. 96) can be considered exemplary. The 19th century is placed in the continuity of the previous centuries and on the other hand clearly differentiated from the degree of globalization of the 20th.

This also applies to his statements about space. He carefully takes care that common terms are not used unchecked as they were in the 19th century:

"The collective name 'Southeast Asia' was created in Japan during the First World War." (p. 137) "The category the 'West', for example, [...] cannot be found as a dominant figure of thought before the 1890s." (P.143) "In the long nineteenth century there was much more talk of the 'civilized world' than of the 'West'. [...] In Japan it was even the goal of national politics to be accepted as a civilized country." (P.144)

Osterhammel then gives an overview of eight major realities under the heading "Panoramas" without claim to completeness, which are intended to capture essential elements of the overall history of the 19th century:

Sedentary and Mobile - Here Osterhammel looks at the entire demographic development, not only on migration and the followings

Living standards - Living standards can be described quantitatively, even if wealth can mean something very different depending on society.

Cities - He sees them on the one hand as representatives of entire civilizations and as nodes. In this role he looks especially at metropolises and ports.

Frontiers - Cities and Frontiers have in common that they attract migrants.

Empires and nation-states - "The 20th century was the great epoch of the nation-state. In the 19th century, the empire, not yet the nation-state, was the dominant territorial organizational form of power on a world scale."

Power systems, wars, internationalisms - The European state system followed agreed rules from 1815, but these only applied in Europe, not to non-European powers. There was a "deliberate de-globalization of international politics

Revolutions - After discussing several definitions of revolution, Osterhammel uses the example of the American and the French Revolution to explain why he sees them as the starting point of 'political modernity'.

State - During the 19th century one could find the greatest variety of political forms.
Energy and industry

Work and employment

Nets

Hierarchies

Knowledge

"Civilization" and exclusion

Religion 

Osterhammel describes five special features of the 19th century:

Osterhammel does not tell from a certain perspective, but looks at the connections, the non-simultaneity of the simultaneous, the diversity of cultures and the time shift of institutions and cultural elements in different cultures from different perspectives. He justifies this courageous approach as follows: "In retrospect, the 19th century can be thought of being globally because it thought so about itself."

Patrick Manning: "In sum, I find the book to be an effective overview of the world history literature as it now exists. The author has demonstrated the ability to draw comprehensively on the literature for many topics and regions for his long nineteenth century, and has articulated it in accounts of many large-scale issues. The book presents a multifaceted narrative of approaches, panoramas, and themes. It reaches back before 1800 to trace the origins of the nineteenth-century world, but puts more effort into showing consequences for the twentieth century."

J. R. McNeill: "In 2009, he published this work in German, and it won acclaim and vaulted Osterhammel to the front rank of historians. When Chancellor Angela Merkel celebrated her sixtieth birthday in 2014, the festivities even featured a lecture by Osterhammel."


"Osterhammel, like the field of world history as a whole, has underemphasized social history, leaving readers with a view of the past that exaggerates elite initiatives as the source of change. [...] The relative brevity of Osterhammel’s discussions on Africa and Latin America, as compared with Europe, North America, and Asia, reflects world-historical bias in favor of initiative from the centers of power and fits with the strengths of the published literature."(Patrick Manning)

Zack Snyder's Justice League

Zack Snyder's Justice League, also known as "Snyder Cut", is the director's cut of the 2017 American superhero movie, "Justice League". 

It is a version of "Justice League", the fifth movie of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and based on the DC Comics superhero team of the same name, as director Zack Snyder had wanted it before he left the production and Joss Whedon took over his duties.

It won the Academy Award for Best Cheer Moment in 2022.

Like the theatrical release, "Zack Snyder's Justice League" is about the Justice League, made up of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg as they try to save the world from the threat of Steppenwolf and Darkseid. However, there are many big differences between the theatrical release and this version of the film, including more backstory on Cyborg (who becomes a much bigger part of the movie), Flash, Aquaman, Steppenwolf, and Darkseid. The "Snyder Cut" takes itself more seriously than the theatrical cut, featuring more action and character development and fewer "corny" jokes, in addition to showing characters who were originally left out like Iris West, Ryan Choi, Martian Manhunter and The Joker. It also gets rid of any scenes that Joss Whedon had filmed, only relying on what Zack Snyder had filmed before leaving the project, in addition to one more scene filmed in 2020.

The movie is divided into six parts with an epilogue due to its 4-hour length.

Thousands of years ago, Darkseid and his parademon armies try to conquer the Earth, but they are defeated by a combined army of humans, Amazons, Atlanteans, Olympic Gods Zeus, Ares and Artemis, and a Green Lantern. In the present day when Superman is killed fighting Doomsday, his dying scream reawakens the Mother Boxes, devices that were used to try and destroy the Earth but left behind by Darkseid, alerting Steppenwolf, who is Darkseid's exiled lieutenant. Aiming to get the boxes to turn Earth into a copy of Apokolips, his home planet, Steppenwolf invades Themyscira first to take the Mother Box guarded by the Amazons, who send a warning to Diana Prince, leading her to find out the history of the Mother Boxes and the first battle on Earth.

Diana informs Bruce Wayne, and as the two are trying to form a team of superheroes in Superman's absence, they realize they need to act fast with Steppenwolf trying to recapture the Mother Boxes. Though Bruce had failed to recruit Arthur Curry, he finds Barry Allen and gets him to join, but Diana is unable to convince Victor Stone to join until Victor's father Silas is kidnapped by the parademons and brought to Steppenwolf. Meanwhile, Arthur is convinced to help the Atlanteans guard their Mother Box. He manages to save Mera when Steppenwolf attacks the outpost but is unable to prevent the alien from taking the second box. Victor arrives in time to help Bruce, Diana, and Barry rescue several S.T.A.R. Labs scientists, including Silas, from an underwater building where Steppenwolf is questioning them about the final Mother Box's location. Though they fight Steppenwolf off, the building is flooded and they are only saved when Arthur arrives and stops the water from reaching them.

Steppenwolf, having failed to get the third box, receives a vision of the Anti-Life Equation that Darkseid wants so he can rule over all universes, realizing it is on Earth. He tells Darkseid and DeSaad, and Darkseid promises to redeem him if he can find the third box and transform Earth with the boxes. Meanwhile, Victor retrieves the Mother Box, which he had hidden, and tells the rest of the team that the device was used by Silas to save his life and rebuild him as a cyborg after a horrific car crash that also killed his mother. After this, the team realizes that the Box can be used to return Superman to life and they all agree to try and bring him back, though they realize the box will alert Steppenwolf either way. They dig up Clark Kent's body before sneaking it to the Kryptonian ship under watch by S.T.A.R. Labs, placing it in the waters of the ship's Genesis Chamber. Clark is resurrected when Barry charges the box with his speed, but having lost his memories, he attacks the team when Victor targets him in self-defense. Lois Lane arrives and calms Clark down before he can kill Bruce, and they go back to Smallville so he can regain his memories.

The box is located by Steppenwolf, but before he can take it, Silas charges it with laser heat, allowing himself to die in the process, so that Victor can track the box. As the team, without Superman, locates the Mother Box in Russia back at the Batcave, Victor decides to separate the "Unity" of the boxes himself, recruiting Barry to help give him a charge to get in. The five heroes arrive as Steppenwolf tries to unite the boxes, with Superman later joining to help them beat up Steppenwolf, but they are not able to stop the Unity in time. As the Unity creates a big explosion, Barry manages to run faster than the speed of light to reverse time and undo this, giving Victor the spark needed to get in and separate the boxes with Superman's help. The team then kills Steppenwolf and throws his body back to Apokolips at Darkseid's feet through a portal. Darkseid vows revenge and aims to come to Earth himself to get the Anti-Life equation.

After the battle, Bruce, Diana and Alfred Pennyworth decide to rebuild Wayne Manor as the team's headquarters. Barry gets a job in Central City's police department, Victor listens to a message left behind by Silas, Arthur goes to see his father, and Clark goes back to being a reporter and Superman. Lex Luthor escapes prison and tells Deathstroke the secret identity of Batman. After another bad dream of a world where Superman is controlled by Darkseid, Bruce wakes up and is greeted by Martian Manhunter, who had been on Earth this whole time pretending to be General Swanwick. He thanks Bruce for forming the team and defeating Steppenwolf before promising to be in touch to help plan for Darkseid's return.


In May 2017, Snyder stepped down during post-production following the suicide of his daughter, and Whedon took over, finishing the movie as an uncredited director. Whedon took over reshoots and other changes that added a brighter tone and more humor, and cut the runtime down to 120 minutes.

The theatrical "Justice League" was a commercial failure and received mixed reviews, leading Warner Bros. to rethink the future of the DCEU.

When it was revealed that the movie had a troubled production and its state before Snyder stepped down, many fans wanted to see Snyder's version of the movie. Fans and members of the cast and crew petitioned for the release of this, which they nicknamed the "Snyder Cut".

At the time, Warner Bros. had no plans to release an alternate cut, and movie industry figures regarded the release as unlikely. However, Warner Bros. changed its mind in February 2020. In May, Snyder announced that the original four-hour cut would be completed and released as "Zack Snyder's Justice League" by the streaming service HBO Max. 

The Snyder Cut will cost $20–30 million to complete the visual effects, score, and editing with an additional $40-50 million for reshoots.

"Zack Snyder's Justice League" was released in March 18, 2021 on HBO Max. and the Philippines released in March 20, 2021 in HBO Go. With a runtime of 242 minutes, it is the longest superhero movie ever made.

Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations

Numerical methods for ordinary differential equations are computational schemes to obtain approximate solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
Since ODEs appeared in science, many mathematicians have studied how to solve them. However, only few of them can be mathematically solved. This is why numerical methods are needed. One of the most famous methods are the Runge-Kutta methods, but it doesn't work for some ODEs (especially nonlinear ODEs). This is why new ODE solvers are developed. The following list includes frequently used methods:

Not only approximate solvers, but the study to "verify the existence of solution by computers" is also active. This study is needed because numerically obtained solutions could be phantom solutions (fake solutions). This kind of incident is already reported. The popular methods are based on the shooting method or spectral methods. Today, European research teams and Japanese experts are working on this topic.

Hilaire Mbakop

Hilaire Mbakop (born February 28, 1973 in Bangangté, Cameroon) is a literary scholar and writer. He publishes his works in German and French. His literary work based on his intercultural experiences (e.g. "Mambé's
Homeland (German: Mambés Heimat) and Black African Aliens (French: Les étrangers noirs africains), on the other hand he practices social criticism and attacks political grievances (e.g. "The Destroyed Village" (German: Das zerstörte Dorf) and "The Hexagon and its accomplices" (German: Das Hexagon und seine Mittäter)).

After graduating from high school in Bangangté, he began studying German language and literature and history at the University of Yaoundé I in 1992 and at the same time completed his teacher training at the Higher Teachers' Training College affiliated with Yaoundé I.

Mbakop's first trip abroad took place in 1996: At the age of 23 he received a scholarship from the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) to prepare his master's thesis at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt / Main. In 1999 it was published under the title On the Problems of Freedom and Individuality: "A Study of Goethe's "Götz von Berlichingen” and “Egmont”." Four years later Mbakop obtained his doctorate from the same university with a dissertation on the pamphlets of Heinrich Mann and André Gide.

Influenced by these authors and the values of Christianity – attendance of the Catholic primary school, PhD scholarship from the Catholic Academic Exchange Service (KAAD) –, he has written some literary works that denounce injustice: Mambé's Homeland (novel, 2007) scourges the gap between poor and poor Rich in Cameroon, Death of a Disabled (novel, 2010) the lack of understanding of an anonymous society for the needs of the disabled, "Les étrangers noirs africains" (Roman, 2011) the discrimination against Black Africans in Germany. The Social Drama "The Destroyed Village" (2010) is a lawsuit against the people of Bali-Nyonga who removed the neighboring village Bawock
from the map in 2007. In the historical drama "The Hexagon and its Accomplices" I (2011), France and its Cameroonian henchmen sit on the dock because of the massacre of the Bassas in the second half of the 50s, and in "The Hexagon and its Accomplices II" (September 2014) they are accused for the genocide against the Bamilékés between 1959 and 1971.

In 2010 Mbakop published "The Wood Fire Fairy Tales" that he had collected three years earlier. In the foreword, he says that he had "written down these oral stories that were in danger of disappearing, so that they are accessible to everyone," and adds, "At the same time, the written form guarantees that this cultural heritage is saved for posterity.”
These fairy tales are a facet of the Medúmbà culture, the richness of which he depicts in his autobiography "My Childhood and Youth", that was equally published in 2010. His most recent work is the collection of poems "The Faces of Life" (October 2014).

Mbakop's socio-political commitment expressed itself not only in his books, but also in his journalistic writings and numerous interviews with the media.

Affair of the Diamond Necklace

The Affair of the Diamond Necklace (, "affair of the Queen's necklace") was an incident from 1784 through 1785 at the court of King Louis XVI of France involving his wife, Queen Marie Antoinette. 

The reputation of the Queen had already been ruined by gossip. The event is historically significant as one of the events that led to the French populace's disillusionment with the monarchy and led to the French Revolution.

In 1772, Louis XV of France decided to make Madame du Barry, with whom he was in love with, a special gift at the cost of 2,000,000 livres (about $15.1 million in 2020 USD). He wanted Parisian jewelers Charles Auguste Boehmer and Paul Bassange to create a diamond necklace that would be the greatest necklace ever made.

A trickster who called herself Jeanne de Valois-Saint-Rémy, also known as Jeanne de la Motte, created a plan to use the necklace to get rich and possibly power and royal honors. In March 1785, Jeanne became the mistress of the Cardinal de Rohan, a former French ambassador to the court of Vienna. 

The Cardinal was hated by Queen Marie Antoinette for having spread rumors about the Queen's behavior to her mother, the Holy Roman empress Maria Theresa. The Queen had also learned of a letter in which the Cardinal spoke of Maria Theresa in a manner that the Queen found offensive.

At this time, the Cardinal was trying to get the Queen's to like him again so that he could become Prime Minister of France. Jeanne de la Motte persuaded Rohan that she had been friends with the Queen. After hearing this, Rohan used Jeanne to get the Queen to like him again (though he did not know that Jeanne was lying to him). Jeanne promised the Cardinal that she will get the Queen to like him.

The affair began after Jeanned continued to send fake letters to the Cardinal pretending to be Marie Antoinette. After Rohan fell in love with Antoinette as he believed she was falling in love with him, he wanted to meet her. In the gardens of the Palace of Versailles, the Cardinal met with a woman he believed to be Marie Antoinette. In fact, the woman was a prostitute, Nicole Le Guay d'Oliva, whom Jeanne had hired because of her resemblance to the Queen. 

Jeanne took advantage of lying to Rohan by asking a lot of money. 

On 21 January 1785, Jeanne told the Cardinal that Marie Antoinette wanted to buy the necklace; but, not wishing to purchase such an expensive item publicly during a time of need, the Queen wanted the Cardinal to act as a secret buyer. A little while later, Rohan negotiated the purchase of the necklace for 2,000,000 livres. Rohan took the necklace to Jeanne's house, where a man, whom Rohan believed to be a valet of the Queen, came to fetch it. The diamond necklace “was picked apart, and the gems sold on the black markets of Paris and London” by Madame de la Motte.

When Marie Antoinette found out about this, she had Rohan arrested publicly. When this happened, Jeanne had left the town but was arrested afterwards. 

Cardinal Rohan and Jeanne de la Motte were found guilty. Rohan was sentenced to strip his honors and ambassador jobs and in exile. Jeanne was sentenced to be whipped, branded and in jail. However, she escaped jail and took refuge in London.

Many books and other works have shown the Affair of the Diamond Necklace:


Jeanne de Valois-Saint-Rémy

Jeanne de Valois-Saint-Rémy (22 July 1756 – 23 August 1791) was a known French thief. She was married to Nicholas de la Motte whose family's claim to nobility is dubious. 

She herself was a descendant of the Valois royal family through an illegitimate son of King Henry II. She is known for her role in the Affair of the Diamond Necklace, one of many scandals that led to the French Revolution and helped to destroy the monarchy of France.
