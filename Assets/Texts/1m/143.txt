Sokil Kyiv

Hockey Club Sokil Kyiv (Ukrainian: ХК Сокіл Київ; English: Falcon Hockey Club), commonly known as Sokil Kyiv or HC Sokil, is a Ukrainian Professional Hockey League team in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. Their home arena is in the city, but the team also plays out of Brovary, still within the Kyiv region.

Sokil is developed many of the country's top young hockey players, producing NHL All Stars such as Dmitri Khristich and Alexei Zhitnik, and Stanley Cup Champions Ruslan Fedotenko and Anton Babchuk.

The team was founded in the summer of 1963 by the Deputy Chairman of Sports of Ukraine, Adrian Miziak, under the name of "Dynamo Kyiv". 1963 may be the official birth date of the team, but it was a decade earlier that a Dynamo team from Kyiv would play in the Soviet Cup, making it as far as the second round of the playoffs. The current incarnation, however, would begin its hockey operations in the second tier of Soviet ice hockey, holding its first game on 27 October 1963 against SKA Kuybyshev.

For the club's 10th anniversary in 1973, the club would drop the Dynamo name. The historical white and blue colors of the Dynamo sports society would be kept intact, but the team would adopt the name of the "Falcon", or "Sokil" in Ukrainian. Though Sokil's play would remain inconsistent throughout the 70s, the hiring of Anatoli Bogdanov as head coach in 1976 would have an immediate impact on the team's fortunes.

With the dissolution of the IHL, orphaned teams from the Soviet Bloc found a home in the newly formed Eastern European Hockey League. Benefiting from a lower level of competition than that of the Russian league, and new head coach Oleksandr Seukand, the team would find renewed success. Sokil would finish 1st overall in 4 of the league's 8 seasons, and become league champions in both 1998 and 1999.

Following the 2008–09 season in the Russian league, the club announced they would rejoin the Belarusian Extraleague for the following year. This was a move largely attributed to the financial burdens brought on by the Russian Ice Hockey Federation's (RHF) mandate that foreign teams pay for the travel, accommodations, and meals of visiting teams. The RHF also demanded that foreign teams pay an annual fee of p. 1,500,000 (approx €35,000).

The team's original colors as Dynamo were, hence the nickname that has held to this day ("white-blues"), white and blue. When the Sokil name was adopted, the team changed their colors to red and blue, the same colors of the Kyiv coat of arms of the time. The team would eventually return to its white and blue roots, along with the addition of a darker accent of blue, as well as black.

The team's original jerseys were white with horizontal blue striping. In 1973, the primary color of red was added, and the body striping was eliminated for a more contemporary look. When the sponsor's name ("Eskulap") was added briefly in 1992, the team logo was changed to a tryzub. Also, the Coca-Cola logo was added to the front of the team's jerseys for a period of time.

2013-14 Atlantic winter storms in Europe

The 2013-14 Atlantic winter storms in Europe was a time of winter storms that happened in Europe.

At the end of October, the St. Jude storm (also called Cyclone Christian), became one of the strongest storms in fall across southern England in the last 40 years. After the St. Jude storm, lots of storms went across western Europe. They brought winds and rain.

A low air pressure area named Godehard was the strongest of these low air pressure areas. It caused some damage in Wales. Its winds left 10,000 homes without electricity in Wales. It happened on the first weekend of November 2013.

On November 2, the M4 Motorway between Margam and Pyle was closed because of the weather and a roof canopy at the Princess of Wales Hospital Bridgend was damaged. The old Severn Bridge on the M48 motorway was closed. On the the Second Severn Crossing speed restrictions to slow cars down. The low air pressure also brought big waves to Aberystwyth which caused some damage to houses near the sea.

An area of high air pressure formed to the west of Britain and Ireland. It formed from late November to early December. It caused many storms to go north to Norway and Sweden. All the storms moved north of the United Kingdom. This meant that in November the country was fairly dry. In December there were long periods of calm weather in France. It was sunny and dry. The weather changed as storms brought strong rain and snowfall to the mountains towards the end of the month.

Until December 14, France (and the United Kingdom and Ireland) were protected by a strong area of high air pressure that went from Africa to the British Isles. However, the Nordic nations were affected by lots of storms, including Windstorm Hilde (November 17), Windstorm Oskari (December 1), Windstorm Xaver (December 5–7), Windstorm Ivar (December 12) and Windstorms Zaki and Adam (December 14–15).

The high air pressure over Britain, Ireland and the Atlantic moved east during the middle of December. It allowed areas of low air pressure to reach western Europe. During the middle of December the jet stream became unusually strong in the North Atlantic. The storms moved under this strong jet stream where they quickly became strong before reaching Western Europe.

The first storm of this period was named Bernd. The storm was also named Emily after Emily Brontë the author. She died on December 19 165 years ago. She also wrote the book Wuthering Heights. Met Éireann (Ireland) gave red warnings for wind at 9:00am on December 18 to many counties in Ireland including Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo and Sligo. The United Kingdom Met Office gave orange warnings for the Highlands, Western Isles, Strathclyde and Northern Ireland.

Dirk formed over North America, and caused some storms in Canada, before it moved into the Atlantic. The weather in North America after saw a steep temperature gradient. It made the jet stream in the North Atlantic stronger. The storm moved under this strong jet stream where it quickly became stronger before reaching Western Europe.

Dirk created the lowest air pressure in Britain and Ireland since 1886 (127 years ago). The all-time low air pressure record for the British Isles was recorded in 1884 (129 years ago).

A stormy period between Christmas and New Year followed as Weather fronts related with the Windstorms Felix (December 30) and Gerhard (January 1, New Year's day) passed over the United Kingdom. It caused even more rainfall and storms to the area.

Windstorm Felix was more remote from the European mainland. It brought strong winds in North-West France in the Brittany area. Storminess near Iceland brought winds up to 140 kilometers per hour (87 miles per hour) to that country. It brought heavy rainfall and more flooding to the United Kingdom.

Microsoft's hardware requirements stipulate that every device running Windows Phone 7 must have a dedicated Search button on the front of the device that performs different actions. Pressing the search button while an application is open allows users to search within applications that take advantage of this feature; for example, pressing Search in the People hub lets users search their contact list for specific people. This has been changed in Windows Phone 7.5 however – as the search button is reserved for Bing – so applications that previously used this feature (such as the Marketplace) now include soft search buttons.

In other cases, pressing the Search button will allow the user to perform a search of websites, news, and map locations using the Bing application.

Windows Phone also has a voice recognition function, powered by TellMe, which allows the user to perform a Bing search, call contacts, or launch applications simply by speaking. This can be activated by pressing and holding the phone's Start button.

Bing is the default search engine on Windows Phone handsets due to its deep integration of functions into the OS (which also includes the utilization of its map service for location-based searches and queries). However, Microsoft has stated that other search engine applications can be used.

Zune software is used to manage and sync content on Windows Phone 7 devices with PCs. Windows Phone 7 can wirelessly sync with the software. In addition to accessing Windows Phone devices, Zune software can also access the Zune Marketplace to purchase music, videos, and apps for Windows Phone and Zune products. While music and videos are both stored locally on the PC and the phone, apps are only stored on the phone even if purchased from the Zune software. Zune software is also used to deliver software updates to all Windows Phone 7 devices.

The Zune software is unavailable for Mac OS X, but Microsoft has released Windows Phone Connector, which allows Windows Phone devices to sync with iTunes and iPhoto. This has since been succeeded by the Windows Phone App, which is designed for Windows Phone 8 but can sync with Windows Phone 7 devices as well.

The "Music + Videos hub" allows the user to access music, videos, and podcasts stored on the device, and links directly to the "Xbox Music Store" to buy music, or rent with the Xbox Music Pass subscription service. When browsing the music by a particular artist, users can view artist biographies and photos, provided by Xbox Music. This hub integrates with many other apps that provide video and music services, including, but not limited to, iHeartRadio, YouTube, and Vevo. This hub also includes Smart DJ which compiles a playlist of songs stored on the phone similar to the song or artist selected. Purchased movies and other videos can be played through Xbox Video.

The "Pictures hub" displays the user's Facebook and SkyDrive (now OneDrive) photo albums, as well as photos taken with the phone's built-in camera. Users can also upload photos to social networks, comment on other's photos, and tag photos on social networks. Multi-touch gestures permit zooming in and out of photos.

The "Office hub" organizes all Microsoft Office apps and documents. Microsoft Office Mobile provides interoperability between Windows Phone and the desktop version of Microsoft Office. Word Mobile, Excel Mobile, PowerPoint Mobile, OneNote Mobile, and SharePoint Workspace Mobile allow most Microsoft Office file formats to be viewed and edited directly on a Windows Phone device.

Microsoft Office can also open files from SkyDrive and Office 365, as well as files stored locally on the phone. Office files on Windows Phone 7 are sorted by tiles: Word documents (blue tile), Excel spreadsheets (green tile), PowerPoint presentations (red tile), and OneNote documents (purple tile).

Windows Phone 7 supports WAV, MP3, WMA, AMR, AAC/MP4/M4A/M4B, and 3GP/3G2 standards. The video file formats supported include WMV, AVI, MP4/M4V, 3GP/3G2, and MOV (QuickTime) standards. These supported audio and video formats would be dependent on the codecs contained inside them. It has also been previously reported that the DivX and Xvid codecs within AVI are also playable on the system. Unlike the previous Windows Mobile operating system, there are currently no third-party applications for handling other video formats. The image file formats that are supported include JPG/JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIF, and Bitmap (BMP).

After the "Mango" update, Windows Phone 7 added the ability for users to have custom ringtones. Ringtone audio files must be under 1MB and less than 40 seconds long. Custom ringtones still cannot be used for text messages, IMs, or emails.

Contacts are organized via the "People hub", and can be manually entered into contacts or imported from Facebook, Windows Live Contacts, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Gmail. Contacts may be manually imported from Outlook using Windows Live Contacts or Gmail. A "What's New" section shows the news feed and a "Pictures" section show pictures from those social networks made by the contacts. A "Me" section shows the phone user's own social network status and wall, allow the user to update his status and check into Bing and Facebook Places. Contacts can be added to the home screen by pinning them to the start. The contact's "Live Tile" displays his social network status and profile picture on the home screen and the contact's hub displays his Facebook wall as well as all of the rest of his contact information and information from his other social networks.

If a contact has information stored on multiple networks, users can link the two separate contact accounts, allowing the information to be viewed and accessed from a single card. As of Windows Phone 7.5, contacts can also be sorted into "Groups". Here, information from each of the contacts is combined into a single page which can be accessed directly from the Hub or pinned to the Start screen.

Windows Phone 7 features a user interface based on a design system codenamed and commonly referred to as Metro. The home screen, called "Start screen", is made up of "Live Tiles". Tiles are links to applications, features, functions, and individual items (such as contacts, web pages, applications, or media items). Users can add, rearrange, or remove tiles. Tiles are dynamic and update in real-time – for example, the tile for an email account would display the number of unread messages or a tile could display a live update of the weather.

Several key features of Windows Phone 7 are organized into "hubs", which combine local and online content via Windows Phone's integration with popular social networks such as Facebook, Windows Live, and Twitter. For example, the Pictures hub shows photos captured with the device's camera and the user's Facebook photo albums, and the People hub shows contacts aggregated from multiple sources including Windows Live, Facebook, and Gmail. From the Hub, users can directly comment and 'like' on social network updates. The other built-in hubs are Xbox Music and Video, Xbox Live Games, Windows Phone Store, and Microsoft Office. Due to Facebook Connect service changes, Facebook support is disabled in all bundled apps effective June 8, 2015.

Windows Phone uses multi-touch technology. The default Windows Phone user interface has a dark theme that prolongs battery life on OLED screens as fully black pixels do not emit light. The user may choose a light theme instead, and can also choose from several accent colors. User interface elements such as tiles are shown in the user's chosen accent color. Third-party applications can be automatically themed with these colors.

What Engadget and Gizmodo felt were notable omissions in a modern smartphone OS have largely been addressed in the Mango update. ZDNet praised the OS's virtual keyboard and noted the excellent touch precision as well as powerful auto-correct and revision software. The touch responsiveness of the OS has also been universally praised by all three sites with reviewers noting the smoothness of scrolling and gestures like pinch to zoom in web browsing. PCWorld ran an article called "Windows Phone 7: Microsoft's Disaster" citing what they call a "lack of security, shockingly bad Office apps, an interface not backed up under the hood and abandonment of the full Microsoft customer base."

The reception to the "Metro" UI (also called Modern-Style UI) and the overall interface of the OS has also been highly praised for its style, with ZDNet noting its originality and fresh clean look. Engadget and ZDNet applauded the integration of Facebook into the People Hub as well as other built-in capabilities, such as Windows Live, etc.

Phouoibi

Phouoibi (Fouoibi) or Phouoipi (Fouoipi) or Phouleima (Fouleima) or Phoureima (Foureima) is the goddess and the female personification of the agriculture, crops, fertility, grains, harvest, paddy, rice and wealth in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Manipur (Antique Kangleipak).
She is the lover of Akongjamba, a hero in ancient legends. But fate doesn't permit the lovers to unite. So, Phouoibi and Akongjamba reincarnated in the legends. 
She was sent by Thangjing to Kege Moirang (Keke Moilang) to prosper the human world.
The lives of the two legendary lovers were believed to be enacted by Thangjing as a part of the Moirang Saiyon of the Moirang Kangleirol legends.

Phouoibi is a spirit of the rice. So, she is not a member of the Umang Lais.

The characters of Phouoibi and other goddesses including Panthoibi and Emoinu depict as well as influence the boldness, courage, independence, righteousness and social honour of Meitei women.
The Meitei people believe that the gleaming black stone is a personification of the goddess, which if kept inside the earthenware pot of the granary, will bring good luck and prosperity, as long as it shines.

Phouoibi or Phouleima literally means "Lady of the Paddy" in Meitei (Manipuri). Phou (Fou) means "unhusked rice", paddy. "Oibi" is derived from the verb "oiba" (meaning "to become") with the feminine suffix "i".

Phouoibi is a goddess who is very fickle in love. She fell in love with many mortals. However, she doesn't live permanently with anyone of them. She went to many places and made love with many mortals only to discard them later. She lived with her favorite lover for some time and later left him. Her nature symbolizes that wealth doesn't last long. There were frequent wars and natural calamities in ancient times. So, the goddess of paddy is described as very inconstant in favouring to the mankind.

According to Meitei culture, the anger of Phouoibi was provoked with the neglect of paddy or rice. The rites and rituals dedicated to the goddess were regularly performed. By doing this, possible misfortunes were warded off that could have came to the peasants.
Once Phouoibi (Fouoibi) set out for a journey along with her sisters ("friends" in another version), Ngaleima and Thumleima. In Moirang, when the goddess was about to cross a river, Akongjamba came to the spot for hunting. Akongjamba and Phouoibi fell in love at first sight.

After some time passed, Phouoibi visited the house of Akongjamba. She disguised herself as a tribal woman ("haonupi" or "haonubi"). Akongjamba was not there but Akongjamba's mother didn't give her good hospitality. Akongjamba's mother was about to hit Phouoibi (disguised as a tribal woman) with a swiping broom. If the broom touched the goddess, all her magical powers will get lost. So, Phouoibi fled to a coop (henhouse). She transfigured herself as a chicken. Akongjamba's mother followed her and counted the number of chicken. She found the number of chicken exactly as it was, neither more nor less. So, she went back to her home. Phouoibi spent the night inside the filthy and smelly henhouse. On the next day, she once again took her original form of a beautiful maiden in a glowing dress. She called Akongjamba's mother to come out. She told her that she wanted to give her the payment for spending a night at hers. She shook an enormous heap of golden grain off her body in the middle of the front yard of the house. Then, Phouoibi left the place travelling towards south east. Akongjamba's mother remained surprised.

In another version of the story, Phouoibi stayed a night at the "yenakha" (left or right side of the house). The place where the goddess stayed came to be known as "Phayeng" ("fai" or "phai" means "to stay").

Later, Akongjamba returned home and found the pile of golden grain as high as a hill in front of the courtyard. When asked, his mother told him all the story. He realised that the lady was Phouoibi. He immediately aftered her. On the way, he found her. He pleaded her to return home and live together. But she refused his proposal. She told him that they are not destined to be together to accomplish their work at that birth. Saying this, she left him sorrowfully.

As Phouoibi travelled towards southeast, she reached a riverbank. She did not know how deep the river was. At that moment, a deer appeared on the other side of the river. She asked the deer if the river was shallow or not. The deer lied telling her that the river was not deep. Phouoibi went down the river. She could not swim and got drowned.

A small ngamhai fish was also swimming there. It helped the drowning goddess to reach the shore of the next riverbank. She thanked the little creature and granted it a boon that it will shine like a mirror in the gleaming water. She wished that the ballad singers will always praise the fish for its silvery beauty whenever they retold her story.

Then, she glared at the deer. She cursed the deer and all its species that if they tried to eat her creation - paddy, then all their teeth will be fallen. So, still today, the deers never eat paddy because of the fear that their teeth will fall off.

"Poinu" (November-December interface month) is the Meitei lunar month of harvesting and the granary must not be disturbed. Its subsequent month "Wakching" (December-January interface month) is the time during which Goddess Phouoibi is worshipped.


Goddess Phouoibi is offered fruits and vegetables in the four corners of a specially prepared place. The place is divided into 3 sections. At each division, seeds are sown. The goddess is invoked by the maibas with the sacrifice of black hen and the offering of rice beer.

If the previous year's crop harvest was good, the maiba prayed to the goddess to give them good crops that year too. And if the previous year's crop harvest was not satisfactory, the maiba prayed to the goddess to give them satisfactory crops with no insects that year.

Rice and flowers on the banana leaves are thrown up on the harvest field by the farmers.

After threshing, Phou Kouba (calling the paddy/rice) ceremony is performed. Phoukourol (Phoukouron or Phougourol or Phougouron) is a hymn for summoning the spirit of the paddy.

Phoukou (Phougou) song is sung like this:

<poem>
"He Lairemma Phouoibi! 
Toi Toi Toi
Thangee Phoubi Peibiro! 
Toi Toi Toi
Chaku Lankubiro! 
Toi Toi Toi 
Thangeena Chingdum Sabiro! 
Toi Toi Toi
Ho Lairemma Phouoibi! 
Toi Toi Toi"
</poem>

To have abundant crop harvest, the Meitei people sing "Phougou Eshei".

It is generally sung during harvest. It is done before the crop is stored in the granary. Goddess Phouoibi is worshipped with Phou Ningthou, the god of rice. Farmers prayed to the two deities for a doubling of the previous year's yield, after the harvest.

The Phou Kouba (calling the paddy/rice) ceremony is more frequently performed in case of mis-happenings to the farmers. Mis-happenings may be theft or burning of the paddy/rice, an animal like cow trespasses the threshing ground, etc. People believe that these are all because of the absence of the goddess. So, they perform the rites and rituals to induce the goddess to stay at their places.

In such cases, Sareng fish (Wallago attu, helicopter catfish) with rice is the most important offering to goddess Phouoibi. It should be cooked with herbs and not with spices.

The Sharotkhaibam (Sorokhaibam) family members used to invoke goddess Phouoibi in ancient times.

Goddess Phouoibi is often identified as a manifestation of Goddess Panthoibi. Many legends say that Panthoibi became Phouoibi after a metamorphosis. She is also regarded as the incarnation of Leimarel Sidabi, the supreme mother earth goddess.

Goddess Phouleima often appears in ancient potteries. She is personified in a round black stone sitting in a pot. It is placed upon the bed of rice grains inside the granary. It is never kept directly on the ground. As long as the goddess is respected, the granary has no lack of grains.

The Phouoibi Waron (Phouoibi Warol) is a 13-14th century Meitei literary work that mentions Goddess Phouoibi as a fickle lady. According to the text, the goddess has love affairs with multiple partners and she always departs them.

The Ningthourol Lambuba mentions that goddess Phouoibi and her six friends went to a place named "Karan Lambuba". They measured all their walking sticks to know whose was the longest one. The stick of Phouoibi was found to be the longest from all by one knot. So, one knot was cut off. The place where the stick was cut off was named as "Kakmayai" ("kak" literally means "to cut" in Manipuri).

The Loyumba Shinyen mentions that people of a family named Sharotkhaibam (Sorokhaibam) used to invoke the goddess of paddy in ancient times.


In 1979, Phouoibi (formerly known as KD6-2-1) and Punshi (formerly known as KD6-18-7) were developed in Manipur State Rice Research Center, Wangbal. After these rice varieties were released, 75 percent of the areas planting high yielding crops constitute 25 percent of Phouoibi rice. Phouoibi matures in 135 days (4–5 months). These rice varieties were found to be more likely to be affected by the insects as compared to the local varieties like "Phourel" and "Moirang Phou".
Ima Keithel (), the world's only women run market, has three major building complexes. Phouoibi Ima Keithel is the Complex Number 3, preceded by Leimarel Sidabi Ima Keithel (Complex Number 1) and Imoinu Ima Keithel (Complex Number 2).

Ngaleima

Lemlei Ngaleima () or Ngareima () is the goddess and the divine female personification of the fishes and the aquatic life in Meitei mythology and religion (Sanamahism) of Ancient Manipur (Antique Kangleipak). She is a sister (or "friend") of the goddesses, Phouoibi, Thumleima and Ereima (Ireima).

The Meitei female given name "Ngaleima" (ꯉꯥꯂꯩꯃ) is made up of two words. The two words are "Nga" (ꯉꯥ) and "Leima" (ꯂꯩꯃ). "Nga" (ꯉꯥ) has multiple meanings. It may mean "to " or "to " in verbal form. It means fish in noun form. Here, the word "Nga" (ꯉꯥ) 
refers to "fish". The word "Leima" (ꯂꯩꯃ) means queen, mistress or lady.

Menstrual blood, charoo (hay, dried paddy stalks), hentak (edible fish paste), sumjit (broom) are considered unholy to Goddess Ngaleima. So, if there is an adverse entry of fish into the fishing nets, the presence of menstruating woman is highly suspected at the spot, especially on the floating dam. Other suspicious reasons are the dropping down of the charoo (hay, dried paddy stalks) or hentak (edible fish paste) or sumjit (broom) by people out of jealousy into the place.

Goddess Ngaleima (Ngareima) is considered to be one of the divine manifestations of Leimarel (Leimalel), the supreme mother earth goddess. It is said that Leimalel becomes Ngaleima when she is in the fish yard.

Thumleima

Noinu Thumleima () or Thumkhong Lairembi () is the goddess of salt and salt wells in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Manipur (Antique Kangleipak). She is a sister (or "friend") of the goddesses, Phouoibi (Phouleima), Ngaleima and Ereima (Ireima). People pray to her so there will be enough salt. Salt is an important part of the human diet.

According to the "Recent Researches in Oriental Indological Studies: Including Meiteilogy" by Moirangthem Kirti, the goddess is a wife of Pakhangba, the royal deity.

The Meitei female given name "Thumleima" (tʰum.lə́i.mə, ꯊꯨꯝꯂꯩꯃ) is made of two words. These words are "Thum" (tʰum, ꯊꯨꯝ) and "Leima" (lə́i.mə, ꯂꯩꯃ). In Meitei, "Thum" (tʰum, ꯊꯨꯝ) means salt, usually the common salt. In Meitei, "Leima" (lə́i.mə, ꯂꯩꯃ) means queen, mistress or lady. 

Another name of goddess Thumleima is "Thumkhong Lairembi" (ꯊꯨꯝꯈꯣꯡ ꯂꯥꯢꯔꯦꯝꯕꯤ). The Meitei word "Thumkhong" (tʰum.kʰoŋ, ꯊꯨꯝꯈꯣꯡ) is made up of two component words, "Thum" (tʰum, ꯊꯨꯝ) and "Khong" (kʰoŋ, ꯈꯣꯡ). "Thum" (ꯊꯨꯝ) means salt. "Khong" (kʰoŋ, ꯈꯣꯡ) means mine (of salt or metallic ores). So, "Thumkhong" (tʰum.kʰoŋ, ꯊꯨꯝꯈꯣꯡ) means "salt ditch" or "salt brine" or "salt mine" or "salt well". Another Meitei word "Lairembi" (ꯂꯥꯢꯔꯦꯝꯕꯤ) is made up of three component words, "Lai" (ꯂꯥꯢ), "-rem" (-ꯔꯦꯝ) and "bi" (ꯕꯤ). "Lai" (ꯂꯥꯢ) means "God". "-rem" (-ꯔꯦꯝ) or "-lem" (-ꯂꯦꯝ) means "excellent". "bi" (ꯕꯤ) or "pi" (ꯄꯤ) is a suffix to denote feminine gender. So, "Lairembi" (ꯂꯥꯢꯔꯦꯝꯕꯤ) means a goddess.

The Goddess Thumleima is one of the divine manifestations of Leimarel (Leimalel). Leimalel is the supreme mother earth goddess. It is said that Leimalel becomes Thumleima when she is in the salt mine. Thumleima is also considered as one of the divine incarnations of goddess Imoinu.

A reverend becomes the new sex education teacher. He talks about sexual abstinence (not doing sex). In the class, Meg gets a boyfriend named Doug. While this happens, One of Stewie's teeth falls out of his mouth. Brian tells him about the tooth fairy. Stewie fears that the tooth fairy will take his tooth. He tries to use Herbert's teeth, but they are not real. He takes the tooth of a girl with an eating disorder. Brian thinks that Stewie is being very crazy, so he tells Stewie that the tooth fairy is not real. However, a man named T. Fairy takes the tooth from the girl with the eating disorder. 

Peter hears what Meg is being taught and thinks that sex is bad. He starts wearing a chastity belt so that Lois does not have sex with him. Lois rapes Peter so that he will like sex again. After that, Lois sees Meg and Doug doing "ear sex" (putting a penis in an ear). Meg thinks that ear sex is still abstinence.

Akongjamba

Akongjamba () was a nobleman of a King in Ancient Moirang. He is a lover of Goddess Phouoibi. But fate doesn't permit the lovers to unite. So, Akongjamba and Phouoibi reincarnated in the legends. The lives of the two legendary lovers were believed to be enacted by Thangjing as a part of the Moirang Saiyon of the Moirang Kangleirol legends.

Once Goddess Phouoibi (Fouoibi) set out for a journey along with Ngaleima and Thumleima. In Moirang, when she was trying to cross a river, Akongjamba came to the place for hunting. He fell in love with Phouoibi at first sight. They became great lovers.

Many days later, Phouoibi went to Akongjamba's house, disguising herself as a tribal woman ("haonupi" or "haonubi"). Akongjamba was not at home. Akongjamba's mother ("Akongjamba's wife" in another version) didn't give her good shelter. She was about to hit Phouoibi (disguised as a tribal woman) with a broom. A divine being could lose his or her powers at the touch of profane objects like broom. So, Phouoibi fled to the coop of the house. She transformed into a chicken. Akongjamba's mother chased her. She counted the number of chickens. She didn't find any new chicken. So, she was gone. Phouoibi spent the night inside the dirty henhouse. On the next day, she once again assumed her true divine maiden form in a glowing dress. She called Akongjamba's mother to come out. She gave her the payment for spending a night at her place. She shook an enormous heap of golden grain off her body. The grains fell in the middle of the courtyard of the house. Then, she was gone to the south east direction. Akongjamba's mother was surprised at this.
When Akongjamba returned home, he found the pile of golden grain as high as a hill in front of the courtyard. His mother narrated him the entire story. He realised that the strange lady was Phouoibi, his ladylove. He immediately followed her path. On the way, he found her. He pleaded her to return home together. But she told him that they are not destined to unite to accomplish their work at that birth. Saying that, she left him.



Khuman Khamba

Khuman Khamba () or Moirang Khamba () is a man of the Khuman clan and the hero of the epic poem the Khamba Thoibi. Khamba is in the Moirang Shayon legend in the Moirang Kangleirol stories from Ancient Moirang. He is the son of nobleman Puremba of Ancient Moirang kingdom. He was orphaned at a very young age. So he was raised by his sister Khamnu. He grew up as a poor man. Later, he married princess Thoibi of Ancient Moirang kingdom.

The word "Khamba" means ultimate or fullness.

Khamba's parents died when he was very young. For a time, their father's friends Nongthonba and Thonglen took care of him and his sister Khamnu. But the two children were not happy with them. So they left and went back to the house they had lived in with their parents. They were happy there even though no one came to help them.

Khamba was brought up by his sister Khamnu. His sister went from place to place to find help and work. She husked paddy for some people. In payment, the women breastfed the infant Khamba. The two siblings grew up. To earn a living, Khamnu sold wood in a market in Moirang. One day, Princess Thoibi met Khamnu. The two became friends. Thoibi asked Khamnu many things. She gave Khamnu food and jewelry. Thoibi asked Khamnu to come with her on a fishing trip in Loktak lake. The king heard that the princess and her companions were to sport on the lake. So he ordered that no man should go to the lake. Khamnu told Khamba about the king's order. On the day of the fishing trip, she left him at home.

Khamba had a dream. In his dream, Goddess Ayangleima (either Panthoibi or Koiren Leima) made herself look like Khamnu and asked him to get green plants to eat. The god Thangjing made him think that the real Khamnu had really told him to go get food. So, he rowed to the lake on a boat. He went in the wrong direction. The god Thangjing made a storm. It blew the boat towards where Thoibi was fishing. Thoibi saw Khamba standing close to her. She asked Khamnu if she knew the strange man disobeying the king's order. Khamnu said no. Khamba did not know what to do. Hearing his sister’s voice, he went closer. Thoibi saw that he was handsome, manly, muscular and well fashioned. Khamba was also amazed at Thoibi's beauty and glamour. It was God's will that they should be lovers. Khamnu worried that her brother might be punished for coming to the lake even though the king had ordered all men to stay away. Thoibi saw that the cloth in Khamnu's clothes was the same as the cloth in Khamba’s headdress. She also saw Khamba wearing the bracelet she had given to Khamnu. Later, Khamnu told Thiobio the truth, that Khamba was her brother. Then, Thoibi became kind to Khamba. She offered him food. She told him to go home before the King saw and punished him.

Once Princess Thoibi visited Khamnu's house. Khamnu's old house was full of holes. So, Khamba hid himself within a mat. Thoibi asked Khamnu about the very mat. Khamnu said that it was where she worshipped the god Khuman Pokpa. Thoibi knew Khamba was hiding there, but she pretended she did not know. She asked if she could pray to the God. She prayed aloud to the God to allow her to worship him daily in the house. Khamba heard her and laughed. Khamba sent his sister to the market to get fruit. When they were alone Thoibi gave Khamba gifts. The made promises before God Khuman Pokpa. Both drank water in which a golden bracelet had been dipped. They vowed to be lovers forever.

Khuman Khamba is famous for being the very best. He was what a man should be. He had many adventures. 

Some of his feats are:

Khamba went out among the menfolk. He joined a wrestling club. Nongban was the best wrestler in the kingdom. He asked Khamba to wrestle with him. To everyone's surprise, Nongban lost to Khamba. Minister Nongthonba asked Khamba his name. At first, Khamba did not want to say who he was. He had already warned by his sister not to tell anyone about his true identity. Later, he told his name. But he did not tell his father's name. Minister Nongthonba became angry because Khamba would not tell him his father's name. Khamba said his father died when he was a baby. He said his sister took care of him. Minister Nongthonba saw that Khamba looked like Purenba. Nongthonba and Purenba had been friends. 
<poem>"True is indeed that the elephant knows not his own brother, and kings forget their sons. Your father died ere his prime, even as a tree dies when men strip it of its bark."</poem>
Nongthonba dearly loved Khamba. In happiness, he told his wives of the lad he had met. He told them to prepare for fine clothes and an delicious foods for Khamba and Khamnu. Nongthonba took Khamba to the market place. Chingkhu Akhuba, the King’s brother, was in the marketplace. Nongthonba introduced Khamba to Chingkhu Akhuba. Then, they introduced Khamba to the King. The King was pleased to see Khamba. The King's brother was also kind to Khamba. He told his people about Khamba and his late father Purenba's high official position, status and glories.

King Chingkhu Telheiba made Khamba the ""Khuntak Leiroi Hanjaba"" (Floriculture Minister). This meant it was Khamba's job to find flowers in the hills and bring them back. Thoibi gave Khamba food for his trip. The next day, Khamba and Angom Nongban Kongyamba went to find flowers. Nongban Kongyamba lied and said they were on his father's land. Khamba did not know that it was a lie and asked where his own father had found flowers. Kongyamba pointed to the southern hills, but he was only pretending to know the answer to Khamba's question. Khamba went there but found no flowers. So, he prayed to God Thangjing. The God decided to help Khamba by putting the scent of flowers on the wind. Khamba found a tree with many flowers. On the way back to the palace, Nongban smelled the food the princess had packed for Khamba. He wondered how Khamba got such good food. 
Kongyamba sent his men to learn how Khamba got the food. In the Palace, they asked the ""Ningon Lakpa"" (women affairs minister) if there had been a feast. But there was no feast. Then, Kongyamba thought of evil plots against Khamba. So, he gathered many people in front of Khamba’s house. He announced that everyone should wear dresses of luxury and jewels of gold and silver in the festival of the Gods. He lied that it was the King's order. Everyone believed him. Khamnu asked him about what he was saying. Kongyamba scolded her if she has no ears for not listening to the King’s order. She wept of shame. Khamba fell sad because he did not have such clothes. In that night's dream of the two siblings, their parents told them about the presence of their clothes of honor in Thonglen’s house. Immediately, they woke up. Even in the night, they went to Thonglen’s house. The guards seized them thinking as thieves. They presented Khamba and Khamnu before Thonglen in the morning. But Thonglen knew the children of his old friend Purenba. He gave them the clothes. He even taught them the dance. Besides, he sent men and women to serve Khamba and Khamnu. He also built them a new house. Thoibi and Senu came to Khamba's house with gifts. But they did not know the house. It was because the house was so well built. Thoibi was shocked to see Khamnu and Khamba wearing rich clothes. It was because she thought that Khamba might had married a daughter of some rich man. Later, she knew the truth.
Kongyamba offered the flowers to the royalties and the nobles. First, he offered some to the King. Secondly, he offered some to the Queen. Later, he offered the rest to the High Officers of the kingdom. It was then Khamba's turn. He feared about the code of conducts. So, he humbly asked the counsel of priestess. For Khamba, they first offer the flowers to God Thangjing. After that, Khamba presented the flowers to the King, to the Queen and then to the High Officers of the kingdom.
Everyone was pleased with the flowers of Khamba. So, they gave him rare gifts. Gifts received by Khamba were many times more valuable than the customary presents received by Kongyamba. 

During the dancing ceremony, Kongyamba and his noble wives danced first. Later, Khamba and Thoibi danced before God Thangjing's holy shrine. The latter's pairing was great. The audiences shouted with joy during the dance. Finally, Khamba and Thoibi knelt before God Thangjing.

Nongban Kongyamba was jealous of Khamba. Every year, the rulers of each Pana (State Province) chose a man to go to the kingdom's sports contest. Khamba's ruler chose him. Nongban's ruler chose him. That year, the contest's foot race was longer than it had been before. Khamba and Nongban both ran a race: Khamba far very fast with his chest low. Nongban ran fast with his head high. Nongban could not run fast for as far as Khamba could.
One night, Kongyamba planned with his men how to defeat Khamba. 
<poem>"Many are the races I have won, and heavy will be my disgrace if this year I am second to Khamba."</poem>
Khamnu worried that somone else in the contest might hurt Khamba out of jealousy.
On the next day, Nongban Kongyamba said to the people, 
<poem>"It is evil for land if a poor man win the race. It might bring scarcity more than the people can bear. Let's say this among the people before the race begin."</poem>
This words spread among the public. Khamba was stopped and told that his name was not in the list of the contestants. Khamba believed them. So, he sadly returned home. He told everything to Khamnu. The two siblings told Nongtholba about it. Nongtholba went to the king. The king told Khamba to go and be in the contest if it was not still late to join.
Khamba joined the foot rate. He ran as fast as he could. But Kongyamba's men tried to stop him while he was running. But Khamba pushed them out of the way. At last, he ran up to Kongyamba. Kongyamba was running slowly because he was tired. Suddenly, fifteen of Kongyamba's horsemen stopped Khamba. But Khamba kicked all of them away.
Khamnu shouted "Run on Khamba, for your father's honor." Finally, Khamba ran to the end of the race. He was the winner, and Kongyamba was second. Both saluted the king. The king was more pleased with Khamba. He gave Khamba a coat with gold thread in it. The queen gave Khamba very good clothes. The ministers also gave him gifts.
Khamba and his sister Khamnu offered many of the clothes to the old men and women.

Nongban Kongyamba wanted something bad to happen to Khamba. When he heard the Kao (bull) was in the Khuman kingdom, frightening people, he had an idea. He went to the king and pretended to have had a message from the god Thangjing. He told the king that Thangjing wanted Khuman to catch the bull. Kongyamba told the King,
<poem>"God Thangjing had spoken in my ears and I have his behest upon me. Verily said the God, I am sated with offerings of flesh and fish, but this year, my heart longs for the sweet savour of the flesh of the mighty bull that lurks in the reeds that border the water of the lake. My servant Khamba vows that he will bring it for my honor and for the welfare of the State."</poem>
The king of Moirang told Khuman he could marry Princess Thoibi hand if he caught the bull. Then the king of Moirang and the king of Khuman both agreed the people could come watch. They built a large arena and many people came.

Then Khamnu told Khamba a secret. She said that the Kao bull had once been their father's tame bull. She told him how to catch the Kao bull: She said, 
<poem>"This great bull was once the Lord of your father's herd. Go to him, speak your father's name in his ear, and show him this Rope of silk."</poem>
In the arena, Khamba stood bravely while the bull ran toward him. He caught it and it carried him away to the woods.
Khamba did everything as his sister told him to do. The wild bull became calm. Khamba put a rope on the bull and began to walk back to the arena. But Kongyamba came and pretended he had caught the bull. He lied to the people. He said he had caught the bull and not Khamba. The two kings did not know who told the truth. So they asked Kongyamba to fight the bull again, where people could see. Kongyamba was afraid of the bull and climbed away. Khamba faced the bull bravely. He once again captured the bull.
Both the Kings honoured Khamba. They presented him many gifts. Since Khamba belonged to Khuman blood, the Khuman king asked the Moirang king to let Khamba live in the Khuman kingdom. The Moirang King did not agree.

Princess Thoibi was exiled by her father to Kabaw chiefdom. After some time, her father changed his mind. So, Thoibi was asked to come back from the exile. Meanwhile, Thoibi's father secretly told Nongban Kongyamba to forcibly elope his daughter from her return journey. 
Thoibi met Nongban. She pretended to be friendly with him. She asked him to let her ride on his horse. He agreed. So, Thoibi rode Kongyamba's horse. 
Surprisingly, Thoibi galloped off on the horse towards Khamba's house. Khamba received her from the long time exile at his house. They wept for their reunion. 
Minister Thonglen and Minister Nongtholba sent men to guard Khamba and Thoibi. 
Kongyamba was angry for being tricked by a girl. He set the matter before the King in the Royal Court. The king wanted to solve the issue by the trial of the spear. During the discussion, an old man came to the meet the king. The old man informed him that a ferocious tiger was a great threat to the villagers of Khoirentak region. 
The King changed his mind. He announced that the tiger will be the determining point of the matter. He added that the killer of the tiger will marry Princess Thoibi. 

The trackers and scouts fenced around the very forest.
On the said day, the King and his ministers gathered there in the stadium. Audiences gathering in the stadium resembled a white cloth spread on the ground. Khamba and Kongyamba showed respect to the King. The two went on and found the traces of the tiger. A body of a recently killed girl was found on the way.
Then, the tiger was found. They threw spears to it. But the tiger turned the spears away. It sprang upon and bit Kongyamba. At this, Kongyamba was killed. Khamba attacked at the tiger. He drove it away. Khamba carried Kongyamba back to the stadium. Thonglen told Khamba,
<poem>"What! Are you afraid? Your father killed five tigers and you fear only one. Go or I will come and kill the beast."</poem>
Khamba re-entered into the woods. The tiger was crouching half hidden by the bushes. But it could be clearly seen from the stadium of the king.
The tiger jumped upon Khamba. Khamba pierced the tiger's predating jaws with his spear. Finally, the beast was killed. The place where Khamba killed the tiger was near a village. 
The King offered rich gifts to Khamba. He offered him great lands. Khamba was also given the rights of fishery, clothes of honor and titles of high fame. He was made the master of a salt-well.

Annually, a Royal archery contest was held in honour of God Thangjing in Ancient Moirang. The contest was for the royalties of the Moirang kingdom. Kongyamba was selected to pick up the arrows shot by the King. Khamba was selected to pick up the arrows shot by the Crown Prince (King’s younger brother). Prince Chingkhu Akhuba asked his daughter Thoibi about his Coat Of Golden Embroidery. But Thoibi had already given the coat to Khamba. So, she told him another lie. 
During the competition, the Crown Prince shot his arrows so swiftly. Khamba ran swiftly to pick them up. At this, Khamba's outer cloth get loosened. The Crown Prince saw the inner cloth of Khamba. It was his golden embroidered coat. He got furious. When Khamba gave him the arrow, he did not take it. He turned away from Khamba. Kongyamba took the arrow from Khamba. He gave it to the Prince. The Prince was pleased with Kongyamba. He told Kongyamba that princess Thoibi would be given to him within five days. Within five days, he planned to give away his daughter Thoibi hand in marriage to Kongyamba. Khamba and Khamnu were even told to bring him gifts on the said day. The prince ordered that no one in the kingdom should sell fruits to the two siblings. Only Kongyamba was allowed to buy the fruits.
Khamba went to a hill village of a tribesmen group. He sought help from Kabui Salang Maiba, the tribal chief. The tribal chief offered him two basketful of fruits. The chief also added some gifts for the princess Thoibi, his sister Khamnu and for Khamba himself. Khamba thanked him and came back with the fruits and the gifts. Thoibi set the fruits ready in eleven special dishes. She was promised by the Chief Queen, 10 other Queens and 10 maids that they will receive gifts from Khamba.
On the day of gift reception, Kongyamba brought his gifts. At his 
arrival, Thoibi pretended to fell with fever. So, Thoibi's father told Kongyamba the princess' health condition. Then, Kongyamba left. Few moments later, the Crown Prince had gone to met the King. Thoibi instantly arose. Gifts from Khamba were received by the Queens and their maids warmly.
At that moment, the Prince returned home. He was very thirsty. He longed for some juices of sour fruits. Thoibi prepared the juice from the fresh fruits brought by Khamba. She poured it into a silver cup for her father. The Prince has a sip of it. He asked for the whereabouts of the fruits. Thoibi told him that the fruits were brought by his son-in-law Khamba for his marriage. At this, the Prince got furious. He threw the silver cup at his daughter. Then, Thoibi pretended to faint. The Prince was terrified. At the same time, the Queens cried for her.
He asked his daughter to get up and go to Khamba’s house. Then, Thoibi arose. But her father resumed to his anger again.

Prince Chingkhu Akhuba and Nongban Kongyamba together planned an evil plot to kill Khamba. They sent messenger to Khamba. The messengers told Khamba that he was called by the Prince. On his way, Khamba was interrupted by Kongyamba and his men. Kongyamba asked Khamba to give up Thoibi. Khamba replied that he will not give up.
As a result, they fought. Khamba threw Kongyamba's men upon the ground. Khamba knelt upon Kongyamba's belly. He pressed Kongyamba's throat. He was about to kill Kongyamba. But Kongyamba's men dragged Khamba off. They beat Khamba. His clothes were torn. They bound him so that he could not move. The Prince also came up on his elephant. He told the men to beat him. They fastened him to the elephant's leg with ropes. However, the elephant driver knew that Khamba was innocent. So, he bound him leaving him some spaces to breathe.
Then they stimulated the elephant to harm Khamba. But God Thangjing let it not to move. Finally, Kongyamba hit the elephant with a spear to move in pain. But it did not harm Khamba. 
In that night, Goddess Panthoibi told Thoibi in her dream that her beloved man was bound by her father’s orders to the elephant and was nearly killed. Thoibi arose and took a sword. She immediately came to the spot for Khamba. The criminals feld from the spot. She cut the ropes that bound Khamba to the elephant. She rubbed his limbs so that blood could flow through them.
Khamnu, Feiroijamba, Nongtholba and
Thonglen were informed about the crime. Thonglen went to the Court with all his army. Feiroijamba said to the Court three times about the harsh cruelty to Khamba. However, the Prince did not pay attention to the complaint. Nongtholba angrily proclaimed that none could kill his son-in-law when he was alive. A conflict between Nongthonba and the prince occurred and continued further. Finally, Nongtholba and Prince Chingkhu Akhuba went to the King.
Before their arrival, Princess Thoibi had already informed the king all the crimes committed by her own father.
King Chingkhu Telheiba proclaimed that all the criminals would be punished. So, he set Prince Chingkhu Akhuba and Nongban Kongyamba in the prison. The king told his brother prince to stay there untill Khamba was well again.
The King sent his own men to take care of injured Khamba. He sent him gifts every day. Thoibi personally took care of Khamba. He got well again. So, the criminals were set free. After this, Thoibi was exiled to Kabaw chiefdom.

Khamba and Thoibi got married in high state by the King of Moirang. 
One day, Khamba got suspicious of Thoibi if she was not faithful to him. He wanted to test her chastity. One night, he pretended to get away from home. Then, he secretly returned home. In disguise as a stranger, he pierced a stick through the wall of Thoibi’s room. He was teasing Thoibi. Thoibi was not aware of all this. So, she thought it was done by a stranger. She got furious. 
She thrusted a spear through the wall to pierce the stranger. Khamba was severely wounded. He called her. Thoibi knew his voice. She immediately went out and carried him in. Khamba was dying. She was extremely shocked. Before he died, she killed herself upon him with the same spear.
Khamba and Thoibi are the incarnations of a god and a goddess. They were sent by God Thangjing. Unlike normal mortal beings, God Thangjing denied their happiness of long life and children.

The Khamba Thoibi Jagoi was first performed by Khamba and Thoibi in the premise of the Thangjing temple. It is now a popular form of folk dance of Meitei culture (Manipuri culture) in Manipur.
In 2010, the Laihui Ensemble produced an opera named ""Kao, the sacred bull"". It is based on the story of capturing Kao (bull) by Khamba.
In 2019, a painting titled "Khambana Kao Phaba" (Lit. Khamba capturing the bull) was exhibited in the Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sangrahalaya (IGRMS) Museum, Bhopal.
In 2020, the legend of Khamba capturing Kao (bull) was produced in its theatrical form named as "Kao Faba". It was displayed in the Iboyaima Shummang Leela Shanglen, Palace Compound, Imphal.

Thoibi

Moirang Thoibi () or Ewanglon Thoibi () is the main character of the Khamba Thoibi story from ancient Moirang Kangleirol legends. She is a princess from the Ancient Moirang kingdom. She is not the king's daughter. She is the daughter of the King's younger brother "Chingkhu Akhuba" and of King "Chingkhu Telheiba" of Moirang. Khuman Khamba, a poor orphan prince, loved Thoibi.

The word "Thoibi" means perfection or completion of beauty and accomplishments.

One day, Princess Thoibi visited the marketplace of Moirang. She saw the girl Khamnu selling wood. She asked Khamnu many questions. She even gave her food and jewelry. Thoibi and Khamnu became good friends. The next time Thoibi went to the market, she met Khamnu again. Thoibi asked Khamnu to come with her fishing on Loktak lake. The king heard that the princess and her friends were going fishing for fun on the lake. He ordered all the men in the kingdom to stay away from the lake. Khamnu told her brother Khamba about this the royal order. The next day, she left him at home. Khamba was sleeping and had a dream. 

In Khamba's dream, Goddess Ayangleima (either Panthoibi or Koiren Leima) made herself look like Khamnu and asked him to get vegetables. Khamba woke up and wondered about his dream. God Thangjing made him think that he had truly seen his sister Khamnu. So he rowed down the lake in a rowboat. But he went in the wrong direction. The God Thangjing spread clouds over the hills, and there was a storm. It blew the boat towards Thoibi and her friends on their fishing trip. Thoibi saw Khamba standing close to her. She asked Khamnu if she knew the strange man disobeying the royal order. Khamnu said no. Khamba did not know what to do. Hearing his sister's voice, he went closer. Thoibi saw that Khamba was handsome, manly, muscular, and well fashioned. Khamba was also amazed at Thoibi's beauty and glamour. It was God's will that they should be lovers. Khamnu worried that her brother might get punished for disobedience. Thoibi noticed a piece of Khamnu's cloth matching Khamba’s headdress. She also discovered Khamba wearing the bracelet she had given to Khamnu. Later, Khamnu revealed the truth. Then, Thoibi became kind to Khamba. She gave him good food. She told him to go home before the King heard that he had broken his rule and come to the lake.

Princess Thoibi visited Khamnu's house. Thoibi sat on the red cloth near the post of the north side (ukoklel). The walls of the old house were full of holes. So Khamba hid himself within a mat. Thoibi asked Khamnu about the mat. Khamnu said that it was the worshipping place of God Khuman Pokpa. So Thoibi asked if she could pray to the God. She wanted to be blessed by the God. Thoibi knew the truth very well. But she pretended if she knew nothing. She prayed out loud to the God to allow her to worship him daily in the house. Khamba heard her voice. He laughed aloud. Thoibi said the God was speaking. She came out in the veranda. Meanwhile, Khamba sent his sister to the market to get some fruit. At Khamnu's absence, Thoibi presented him gifts. The two bound themselves by an oath before the God Khuman Pokpa. They drank the water in which a golden bracelet had been dipped. They vowed to be lovers forever. After this oath, Thoibi addresed Khamnu as "sister".

The King made Khamba the ""Khuntak Leiroi Hanjaba"" (Floriculture Minister) to gather flowers from the hills. Thoibi prepared delicious food for Khamba. She tied the food in a bundle of leaves. She fastened it with silks of seven kinds. By the grace of God Thangjing, not a petal of a single flower brought by Khamba was broken. At Khamba's return, Thoibi washed his feet and offered him fruits.
On the day of customary rituals to be performed, Khamba first offered his flowers to God Thangjing. After that, Khamba gave the flowers to the king, to the queen and then to the high officers of Moirang. 
Everyone was happy with the flowers. They gave Khamba gifts. Khamba and Thoibi danced before God Thangjing's holy shrine. The pairing was great. The people watching shouted with joy during the dance. Finally, Khamba and Thoibi knelt before God Thangjing.

Thoibi's father asked her to marry Nongban Kongyamba. But she said no. Her father was angry and he said, "I will be better to be childless than be the father of this evil girl." He asked his Minister Hanjaba to sell Thoibi to the Kabaw chief for silver and gold. He exiled her to Kabaw chiefdom. He did not want to see her any more. Thoibi told Khamba about what happened. For his sake, she had to go exile to Kabaw. She told Khamba not to forget her. 
On the day of her exile, she cried so hard that she sounded like thunder. The queen and all her maids also wept. Minister Hanjaba took her away to Kabaw. On the way, she met Khamba. He wept with her remembering the past happy days. Both the lovers felt the pain of separation. 
Khamba gave Thoibi a staff to lean on as she walked. On her way, Thoibi planted the staff by the roadside. She wished for it to grow flowers and become a living, leafy tree if she remained faithful to Khamba. She also marked a roadside stone. Finally, she reached Kabaw. But Chief Tamurakpa of Kabaw felt sorry for Thoibi. He kept her as a guest. Thoibi became a friend of Changning Kanbi, the daughter of the chief. But the evil women of Kabaw persuaded Changning to treat Thoibi like a servant. Thoibi was sent to catch fish and to gather firewood. Thoibi was busy with her work. However, she always dreamed that Khamba was with her. Thangjing took pity on her. Chief Tamurakpa heard about the harsh treatments of Thoibi by his own daughter. So he asked all the women to weave one cloth each. Changning called Thoibi a wayward child. It was because of Thoibi had not wanted to marry Kongyamba. Changning knew Kongyamba was muscular, attractive and the son of famous ancestors. So she thought Kongyamba as a good man. 
Tamurakpa heard his daughter's words. He was angry with her. He was about to strike her but Thoibi stopped him. The two ladies wove their cloths. Changning was jealous of Thoibi. In the night, Changning tore holes in Thoibi's cloth with a porcupine quill. Later, Thoibi found all that had been done. However, she repaired all the holes and made the cloth even more beautiful than before. Tamurakpa liked Thoibi's cloth very much. He threw his own daughter's cloth away.
One day, when Thoibi was working at her cloth making machine, a wind brought ashes towards her. She knew it was from Moirang. She wept remembering her beloved Khamba and her hometown. The God Thangjing softened her father's heart. He sent men to bring her back. However, he asked Kongyamba to marry Thoibi on her way home. However, Thoibi prayed to the patron deity of the Kabaw chiefdom. She thanked Chief Tamurakpa for his kindness. 
On her way, she saw the stone on which she had written her promise to be faithful to Khamba. She prayed to it and offered gold and silver on it. She saw Khamba's staff which she had planted. It had grown flowers and become a living, leafy tree.

When Thoibi was on her way back home, her suitor Angom Nongban Kongyamba waited for her. Kongyamba asked his watchmen if Princess Thoibi was coming. After looking carefully, they shouted,
"Lo, the Princess is at band."
Thoibi heard the shout. She instructed her companions to sit near her if the man was Khamba but far away if the man was Kongyamba.
It was Kongyamba and not Khamba. 
However, she went on. She pretended to be friendly to him. She sat on the red carpet Kongyamba had brought. However, she placed a stick between Kongyamba and herself. She asked him for fruit to eat. Kongyamba brought her fruit. But she did not eat the fruit. She pretended to get ill due to her long journey from Kabaw. Kongyamba was worried. 
She asked Kongyamba to let her ride on his horse. He agreed. So Thoibi rode Kongyamba's horse and Kongyamba rode in Thoibi's palanquin. 
Suddenly, Thoibi galloped off on the horse towards Khamba's house. Khamba met her there. They wept because they were together again.
Kongyamba was angry that he had been tricked a girl. He asked the king's ministers to act. Minister Thonglen and Minister Nongtholba sent men to protect Khamba and Thoibi from their enemies.
The matter was set before the King in the royal court. The king wanted to solve the issue by the trial of the spear. During the talk, an old man came to the meet the king. The old man told him that a ferocious tiger was a great threat to the villagers in a place called Khoirentak. 
The king changed his mind. He said he would use the tiger to decide what to do. He said that person who killed the tiger could marry Princess Thoibi.

Khamba killed the man-eating tiger. 
Thus, Khamba and Thoibi married each other in high state by the King of Moirang.
One day, Khamba wondered if Thoibi was faithful to him. He wanted to test her chastity. One night, he pretended to travel away from home. Then, he secretly returned home. In disguise as a stranger, he pushed a stick through the wall of Thoibi's room. He was teasing Thoibi. Thoibi was not aware of all this. So, she thought it had been done by a stranger. She got angry. 
She pushed a spear through the wall to hit the stranger. Khamba was severely wounded. He called her. Thoibi knew his voice. She immediately went out and carried him inside. Khamba was dying. She was extremely shocked. Before he died, she killed herself upon him with the same spear.
Khamba and Thoibi are the incarnations of a god and a goddess. They were sent by Thangjing. Unlike normal mortal beings, God Thangjing denied their happiness of long life and children.

Khamnu

Khamnu (/kʰəm.nu/) is a woman in Meitei stories. She is in the epic poem "Khamba Thoibi". She is the daughter of prime minister "Khuman Puremba" of Ancient Moirang. Biologically, she is a daughter of King "Chingkhu Telheiba" of Ancient Moirang. She is the older sister of Khuman Khamba. She is best known for raising her younger brother when he was a child. The two siblings became orphans during their infancy. She feared of being conspired by others. So, she fled with her younger brother from her hometown. They took asylum in the village of the chief in the hills.

Khamnu and her younger brother Khamba were given fatherly care by General Thonglen and Nobleman Chaoba Nongthonba before and after their time living at the Kabui village in the hills. 

Khamnu worked very hard to raise her younger brother. So she is often compared to of the Mahabharata.

Khamnu's parents died. After this, life became very difficult for her and her brother Khuman Khamba. Khuman Khamba was still a baby. Khamnu went from place to place to get help to work in Moirang. She husked paddy for some people. The women who owned the paddy paid her by breastfeeding the infant Khamba. Like this, she worked and got help until she and her brother were both adults. To earn a living, Khamnu sold wood in a market of Moirang. One day, Princess Thoibi visited the marketplace. She noticed Khamnu, a strange new face. She asked Khamnu many things. She even gave Khamnu food and jewelry. Khamnu and Thoibi met once more. Thoibi asked Khamnu to come with her when she went fishing in Loktak lake. So Khamnu accompanied the princess in sporting on the lake.

Once Princess Thoibi visited Khamnu's house. Meanwhile, Khamnu went out to the market to bring some fruits. At Khamnu's absence, Thoibi presented Khamba gifts. The two bound themselves by an oath before the God Khuman Pokpa. They drank the water in which the golden bracelet was dipped. They vowed to be lovers forever. After this oath, Thoibi addressed Khamnu as "sister".

Khamnu's younger brother Khamba went out among other men. He joined the wrestling club. While wrestling, Khamba defeated Nongban. Nongban was the champion of all the wrestlers in the kingdom. At Nongban's defeat, Khamba's long hidden identity was known to everyone. He is the son of great warrior Khuman Purenba. 
At this, Minister Nongthonba remembered the marriage engagement between Feiroijamba, his firstborn son, and Khamnu. They went to Khamnu. Khamnu hid herself in the women's chamber. They cried tears and were very sad. At this, Khamnu came out. She received the gifts from them. From this time onwards, Khamnu and her brother Khamba were always supported by Minister Nongthonba, Minister Thonglen and Feiroijamba in every way of life.

Khamnu's younger brother Khuman Khamba was ordered to capture the Kao bull from the Khuman kingdom. At this, Khamnu revealed a secret of the Kao (bull) to Khamba so that Khamba could catch him. She said, 
<poem>"This great bull was once the Lord of your father's herd. Go to him, speak your father's name in his ear, and show him this Rope of silk."</poem>
On the day of the adventure, Khamba did everything as his sister had told him to do. This tamed the bull.

Khamnu and Feiroijamba got married after the wedding of Khuman Khamba and Moirang Thoibi. Her marriage engagement was set by Nongtholba and late Purenba long time back.

Khamnu Keithel (literally, ""Khamnu market"") was constructed at INR 9 crore (1.2 million US Dollar) under the project of Planning and Development Authority (PDA) in Moirang.

Nongban

Angom Nongban Kongyamba, known by just one name as Nongban, is a nobleman in Ancient Moirang. He is a rich man of Angom clan. He is the main villain in the Khamba Thoibi epic legend. He was a polygamous man. He wanted to marry Princess Thoibi. Prince "Chingkhuba", Thoibi's father, agreed to give him the princess' hand in marriage. However, Thoibi was in love with Khuman Khamba. So, he and "Chingkhuba" thought of many ways to stop Khuman Khamba. But none of their plans worked.

Nongban was jealous of Khuman Khamba and wanted to show he was better than Khamba was. So he challenged Khamba many times.

Nongban was the champion of Ancient Moirang kingdom in every field. No one could defeat him in wrestling, hockey and racing. He invited Khuman Khamba to wrestle with him. To everyone's surprise, Nongban was defeated by Khamba. From that time onwards, Nongban Kongyamba was jealous of Khuman Khamba.

Once Nongban and Khamba went on to gather flowers. The flowers were to be offered to God Thangjing. They went to the hills. They reached a place where some flowers grew. At this, Kongyamba claimed the place as his father's place. He told Khamba the king's would be angry. Khamba did not know that it was a trick. Khamba asked about his father's place to gather flowers. Kongyamba randomly pointed to the southern hills. Khamba went there but found no flowers. So, he prayed to God Thangjing. God sent a whirlwind bearing flowery fragrances towards Khamba. Khamba found a tree with many flowers. He gathered the flowers. On his way back, he sang songs in honor of princess Moirang Thoibi. Kongyamba heard the song. He became angry. Kongyamba asked Khamba to carry his flowers too but Khamba said no. They fought. They only stopped when they became hungry. The sweet smell of the delicious food of Khamba was very rich. So Kongyamba was wondering about it. Meanwhile, the crows came down and ate Kongyamba's foods. So he was very angry. Back at home, Kongyamba fell enraged with his wife.
Kongyamba sent his men to know about Khamba's dainty foods. In the Palace, they asked the ""Ningon Lakpa"" (women affairs minister) if there had been a feast. But there was no feast. Then, Kongyamba thought of evil plots against Khamba. So, he gathered many people in front of Khamba’s house. He announced that everyone should wear dresses of luxury and jewels of gold and silver in the festival of the Gods. He lied that it was the King's order. Everyone believed him. Khamnu asked him about what he was saying. Kongyamba scolded her if she has no ears for not listening to the King’s order. She wept of shame. Khamba fell sad because he had such clothes. However, Khamba managed to find such clothes for himself.
Kongyamba offered the flowers to the royalties and the nobles. First, he offered some to the King. Secondly, he offered some to the Queen. Later, he offered the rest to the High Officers of the kingdom.
Everyone was more pleased with the flowers of Khamba. So, they gave him rare gifts. Gifts received by Khamba were many times more valuable than the customary presents received by Kongyamba. During the dancing ceremony, Kongyamba and his wives danced first. Later, Khamba and Thoibi danced before God Thangjing's holy shrine. People were more pleased with the dance of Khamba and Thoibi in comparison to that of Nongban and his wives.

Kongyamba fell jealous of Khamba's increasing fame. Sportsmen prepared for the annual racing and wrestling championships. The officers of the respective "Pana"s (State Provinces) chose their respective champions. For Khamba's pana, he was chosen. He ran far very fast with his chest held low. For Kongyamba's pana, he was selected. But Kongyamba ran with his head high. He ran fast but not for very far. The championship organizers made that year's race longer than it had been the year before. In both wrestling and running, both Khamba and Kongyamba were the best on their own teams.
At that day's night, Kongyamba planned with his men how to defeat Khamba.
<poem>"Many are the races I have won, and heavy will be my disgrace if this year I am second to Khamba."«/poem>

On the next day, Kongyamba announced to the people,
<poem>"It is evil for land if a poor man win the race. It might bring scarcity more than the people can bear. Let's say this among the people before the race begin."</poem>
This words spread among the public. Khamba was stopped and told that his name was not in the list of the contestants. Khamba believed them. So, he sadly returned home. He told everything to Khamnu. The two siblings told Nongtholba about it. Nongtholba went to the king. The king told Khamba to participate if it was not still late to join.
Khamba and Feiroijamba went to the starting place of the race. The race was about to be started. Khamba ran swiftly as fast as he could. Then, Kongyamba's men interrupted Khamba on his way. But Khamba stroke all of them aside. At last, he reached up Kongyamba. Kongyamba was running slowly as he got tired. Suddenly, fifteen horsemen of Kongyamba stopped Khamba. But Khamba kicked out all of them from his way.
Finally, Khamba reached the final destination. He was the champion and Kongyamba was the second. Both saluted the King. The King was more pleased with Khamba.

Kongyamba was thinking about an evil plot against Khamba. But the Gods did not give him any evil hints in his dreams. So, he built a hut. Inside the hut, he tried to connect with a spirit. But he failed. One day, he met fisher women from the Khuman kingdom in the region of Moirang. Both the Khuman kingdom and the Moirang kingdom were in shores of the Loktak lake.
The women came to Moirang besides having their own fishing area. So, Kongyamba asked them the reason for coming to Moirang.
The women told him:<poem>"There is a great bull that lurks among the reeds of the shores of the lake, and it had claimed life of many. So, we dare not to fish there."</poem>
Suddenly, an idea came to Kongyamba's mind. He went to the king. He acted as a person possessed by a divine spirit. Kongyamba told the King,
<poem>"God Thangjing had spoken in my ears and I have his behest upon me. Verily said the God, I am sated with offerings of flesh and fish, but this year, my heart longs for the sweet savour of the flesh of the mighty bull that lurks in the reeds that border the water of the lake. My servant Khamba vows that he will bring it for my honor and for the welfare of the State."</poem>
The king called and asked Khamba about his promise. Khamba denied it. There resulted a great conflict between Khamba and Kongyamba. Later, Khamba told the king he would catch the bull if it was the God’s will.
The king was pleased with Khamba. So, he promised him to give Princess Thoibi hand in marriage if he succeeded in the adventure. Minister Thonglen put seven marks on the lintel post of the capital city. It was the record of the King’s promise.
The king of Moirang sent an embassy to the king of Khuman. The embassy proposed the great sport to be organized. The Khuman king agreed. A grand Colosseum was built. The Colosseum could hold a capacity of the audiences from both the two kingdoms.

Khamba captured the bull. He was bringing it to the two Kings' residing place. On the way back, Kongyamba came to him before anyone saw them. Kongyamba pretended to help Khamba to hold the bull. Kongyamba hold the rope. When everyone saw, Kongyamba claimed that he had captured the bull. He added that he even rescued Khamba who fell into the ditch. Once again, there was a great conflict between Khamba and Kongyamba over the claim. The two Kings could not find out who was right. So, Kongyamba was asked to fight the bull within an enclosure. But Kongyamba got frightened of the bull. So, he climbed up on the heights to save himself. Khamba faced the bull bravely. He once again captured the bull.

Annually, a Royal archery contest was held in honour of God Thangjing in Ancient Moirang. The contest was for the royalties of the Moirang kingdom. Nongban Kongyamba was selected to pick up the arrows shot by the King. Khamba was selected to pick up the arrows shot by the Crown Prince (King’s younger brother). Chingkhu Akhuba, the Crown Prince asked his daughter Thoibi about his Coat Of Golden Embroidery. But Thoibi had already given the coat to Khamba. So, she told him a white lie.
On the day of the competition, the target was set. The royal priests sang charms over the arrows and the bows of the contestants. The King shot his arrows. Kongyamba fetched the arrows and gave back to the king. For the Crown Prince, Khamba was to fetch the arrows. The Crown Prince shot his arrows so swiftly. Khamba ran swiftly to pick them up. At this, Khamba's outer cloth get loosened. The Crown Prince saw the inner cloth worn by Khamba. It was his golden embroidered coat. He got furious. When Khamba gave him the arrow, he did not take it. He turned away from Khamba. Kongyamba took the arrow from Khamba. He gave it to the Prince. The Prince was pleased with Kongyamba. He told Kongyamba that princess Thoibi would be given to him within five days. From this time onwards, Nongban Kongyamba gained favor from Thoibi's father, the Crown Prince.

The Crown Prince and Nongban Kongyamba planned an evil plot to kill Khamba. They sent messengers to Khamba. The messengers told Khamba that he was called by the Crown Prince. On his way, Khamba was interrupted by Kongyamba and his men. Kongyamba asked Khamba to give up Thoibi. Khamba replied that he will not give up.
As a result, they fought. Khamba threw Kongyamba's men upon the ground. Khamba knelt upon Kongyamba's belly. He pressed Kongyamba's throat. He was about to kill Kongyamba. But Kongyamba's men dragged Khamba off. They beat Khamba. His clothes were torn. They bound him so that he could not move. The Prince also came up on his elephant. He told the men to beat him. They fastened him to the elephant's leg with ropes. However, the elephant driver knew that Khamba was innocent. So, he bound him leaving him some spaces to breathe.
Then they stimulated the elephant to harm Khamba. But God Thangjing let it not to move. Finally, Kongyamba hit the elephant with a spear to move in pain. But it did not harm Khamba.
In that night, Goddess Panthoibi told Thoibi in her dream that her beloved man was bound by her father’s orders to the elephant and was nearly killed. Thoibi arose and took a sword. She immediately came to the spot for Khamba. The criminals feld from the spot. She saved Khamba from the criminals as well as the elephant.
The news was informed to Khamnu, Feiroijamba, Nongtholba and Thonglen. Nongtholba, Feiroijamba and Thonglen went to the Royal Court with all their armies. Feiroijamba said to the Court three times about the harsh cruelty to Khamba. However, the Prince did not pay attention to the complaint.
Nongtholba and Prince Chingkhu Akhuba had a conflict on the matter. The conflict could not be resolved without the King. Finally, both went to the King for the judgement.
Before their arrival, Princess Thoibi had already informed the king all the crimes committed by her own father.

The King proclaimed that all the criminals would be punished. So, Nongban Kongyamba, Prince Chingkhu Akhuba (Thoibi's father) and other men were sent in the prison. The King told the Prince to stay there until Khamba was well again.
The King sent his own men to take care of injured Khamba. He sent him gifts every day. Thoibi personally took care of Khamba. He got well again. So, Nongban Kongyamba and the Prince were set free.

The Prince asked his daughter Thoibi to marry Kongyamba. But she rejected. So, in anger, he exiled her to Kabaw chiefdom. He did not want to see her anymore.
During her exile, Thoibi always missed her beloved Khamba as well as her hometown. God Thangjing softened her father's heart. He sent men to bring her back. However, he asked Kongyamba to forcibly elope Thoibi from her return journey.

Kongyamba and his men were waiting for Princess Thobi's return. When they saw the princess returning, his men shouted,
"Lo, the Princess is at band."
Thoibi heard the shout. She instructed her companions to sit near her if the man was Khamba but far away if the man was Kongyamba."
It was Kongyamba and not Khamba.
However, she went on. She pretended to be friendly with him. She sat on the red carpet of Kongyamba's possession. However, she placed a stick between Kongyamba and her. She asked him for fruits to eat. Kongyamba brought her fruits. But she did not eat the fruits. She pretended to get ill due to her long journey from Kabaw. Kongyamba was worried.
She asked Kongyamba to let her ride on his horse. He agreed. So, Thoibi rode Kongyamba's horse. Kongyamba rode in Thoibi's palanquin.
Surprisingly, Thoibi galloped off on the horse towards Khamba's house. Khamba received her from the long time exile at his house. They wept for their reunion.
On the other hand, Kongyamba was angry for being tricked by a girl. He tried to gain support from the King's ministers to intervene into the matter. In the meantime, Minister Thonglen and Minister Nongtholba sent men to guard Khamba and Thoibi.
The matter was set before the King in the Royal Court. The king wanted to solve the issue by the trial of the spear. During the discussion, an old man came to the meet the king. The old man informed him that a ferocious tiger was a great threat to the villagers of Khoirentak region.
The King changed his mind. He announced that the tiger will be the determining point of the matter. He added that the killer of the tiger will marry Princess Thoibi.

King Chingkhu Telheiba of Moirang announced that the killer of the man-eating tiger of Khoirentak could marry princess Thoibi. Nongban Kongyamba and Khuman Khamba were chosen for the task. The ferocious tiger killed Nongban during the hunt.
In his dying bed, Nongban requested Khuman Khamba to allow him to sing a song about princess Thoibi (alias Thadoi). The request was granted. After he died, his soul turned into a legendary bird named "Pithadoi" ("Pee Thadoi"). Pee Thadoi continued to sing songs about Thadoi. His songs are sung in pathetic and tragic notes.

In 2011, ""Kao, the sacred bull"" was produced by the Laihui Ensemble. This theatrical show was based on the story of Kao (bull) captured by Khuman Khamba. According to the story, the Oracle (Nongban himself) chose Khamba to capture the bull.

Tholpuram Valakkamparai Muthumariamman Temple

Tholpuram Valakkamparai Muthumariamman Temple is a Hindu temple in Valakkamparai, Tholpuram, Sri Lanka.

Legends say that one day, an old man was taking care of his flock when an old lady called to him. She asked the man to get her some water to drink. The man said he would do this. He went to a nearby well and got water for the woman. The woman then asked him to take care of her hair. That night, the man had a dream. The woman appeared in his dream. She asked him to build a small temple for her. The next day, the man told his friends and neighbors about his dream. They set up a small hut and began to worship the woman as a goddess. People have believed that she chose this place because she thought it would be a good place to live. It is believed that the area had many types of trees. The area still has many trees today.

The Dutch ruled the area in 1658. They ruled from 1658 until the British took control in 1796. During this time, a history book was written by A. Muthuthambipillai. The book says that Saravanamuthu Mudaliar was a Panchayat judge. It says that he held his court in a place now called 'Sathiyakadu'. This place was is in Tolpura at that time. With the permission of the Governor of Holland, a temple was built at Tolpura.

According to documents from near the year 1650, the temple was built using burnt bricks. Laterm descendants of the original builders rebuilt the temple using stone. The cost of rebuilding the temole were paid for by the people of Valakkamparai in Tholpuram.

The main religious festivals at the temple are celebrated during June or July. They include the Chariot Festival.

There is a large air-conditioned hall at the temple. It is used for the weddings of the Hindu people. The wedding hall can also be used for other activities. The hall can hold a maximum of 500 people. This hall started functioning in 2015.

Maruoka Castle

Maruoka Castle (丸岡城, "Maruoka-jō") is in Sakai, Fukui Prefecture. It is also called Kasumi-ga-jō (霞ヶ城). The castle tower was built between 1624 to 1644. It is one of the twelve existing castle towers in Japan (現存十二天守, "genzon-jūni-tenshu"), and also one of the national important cultural properties.
In 1576, Nobunaga Oda ordered Katsutoyo Shibata to build Maruoka Castle to get ready for the ikkō-ikki, a rebellion by believers of the Jōdo Shinshū sect of Buddhism in the 15th-16th centuries. In 1613, Narushige Honda became the first lord, castle owner, of the Maruoka Castle. After the Honda family, the Arima family were lords of Maruoka Castle from 1695 to 1869. Shigesumi Arima was lord from 1772 to 1830. He rebuilt the local domain economy. On 8 July 1948,  an earthquake hit Fukui. The quake destroyed the castle tower of Maruoka Castle. But, in 1955 the castle tower was repaired by recycling more than 70% of the original materials of Maruoka Castle.

Maruoka Castle’s stone walls are about 6.2 meters high. The stone walls were built using "nozura-zumi" (野面積み), an architectural method to build stone walls with a good system of drains. This protects the building from damage by heavy rain. Maruoka Castle is also famous for its steep stairs. The stairs that go up from the first floor to the second floor are at an angle of 65 degrees. The stairs from the second floor to the third floor are at an angle of 67 degrees.

About 400 cherry trees were planted around Maruoka Castle, and this place was chosen as one of the Japan’s Top 100 Cherry Blossom Viewing Sites in 1990. There is a Cherry Blossom Festival there every year.
Shigetsugu Honda, whose son was the first lord of Maruoka Castle, sent a letter to his wife during a war at Shitaragahara in 1575. 

"A brief message. Don't start a fire. Don't make Osen cry. Feed my horses."

This letter is said to be famous for the shortest letter in Japan, and there is a stone monument engraved with this letter in Maruoka Castle. In 1993, this contest was started to let more people know that the shortest letter was in Maruoka Castle.

This museum was opened in March 2019. On the first floor, there are exhibits of Maruoka folklore, and on the second floor, there are exhibits of the history of Maruoka Castle.

This museum opened on 23 August 2015. In this museum, the winning works of the Contest of Brief Massages are exhibited.

The total number of visitors to Maruoka Castle, both paid or free, was about 150,000 in the first year of Reiwa, and about 70,000 in the second year due to the spread of coronavirus. 

Most visitors are in their 60s or older or with their families, but recently, female visitors in their 20s to 40s are also increasing due to the castle boom. The museum is also used by elementary, junior high, and high school students for school trips and field trips. 

In 1576, Katsutoyo Shibata tried to build Maruoka Castle, but it had collapsed many times. Therefore, he received a proposal to stabilize the castle by putting a human pillar in the castle tower. The person chosen as the human pillar was one-eyed Oshizu, who was a woman living a difficult life with two children. Oshizu offered Katsutoyo that one of her children would serve as a samurai in the future, and she decided to become the human pillar on that condition. Although the castle was completed, Oshizu’s children could not be a samurai because Katsutoyo was transferred elsewhere. Oshizu’s spirit resented this, so it rains a lot every April. People call this “Oshizu’s Tears”, and they built a grave of her to console her spirit. This story is fiction, but it is one of the most famous stories of Maruoka Castle.

Moirang Kangleirol

The Moirang Kangleirol (), also spelt as Moilang Kangleilol, is a body of history, literature, folklore, mythology, legends and other accounts originally associated with the ancient kingdom of Kege Moirang ().
In general sense, the terms Keke, Moirang and Ngangoi are used synonymously since ancient times to refer to the ancient kingdom.

Keke Kangla was the capital city of the ancient Moirang kingdom. It's a place of political administration as well as religious practices. People of the kingdom used to perform annual sacred ceremonies in the city.
The Moirang Ningthourol (genealogy of the rulers of Moirang) was calculated with reference to many ancient manuscripts, including the Cheitharol Kumpapa.

The mythology associated with Moirang Kangleirol has diverse range of accounts. 
There are Phamlons of deities. The nine gods and the nine goddesses participated in the divine harvesting festival of Thangjing Loutaba. They are collectively called the Laibungthous and the Laibenthous respectively.

The Moirang Shayon legends from the backbone of the Moirang Kangleirol.

The list of the seven pairs of incarnations are:

Habutae

Habutae is a type of silk. There are different kinds of "habutae" silk such as plain or striped "habutae". "Habutae" is traditionally used for kimono and undershirts. Recently, it is also used for general goods, works of art, and clothing. "Habutae" is smooth to touch, glossy, and soft. It has been said "The quality of silk fabric begins with habutae and ends with it." "Fukui" is a suitable region to produce "habutae" as the dryness and wetness of the air are well-balanced throughout the whole year.

In 1871, Kimimasa Yuri, who was a lord of "Fukui" Domain (region), brought some silk goods from Europe to Fukui when he joined a study tour in Europe. He showed the goods to people who studied silks in "Fukui" and they started doing technical research on weaving "habutae". In 1887, basic technology for weaving "habutae" silk was completed in "Fukui" city. The economic boom of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 and World War I boosted progress and production of "habutae" in "Fukui". In the early 1900s, production of "habutae" in Fukui earned 1.7 million dollars, up to 60% of the total exports of "habutae" in Japan. The demand for "habutae" made in "Fukui" has kept increasing in Japan, and it is still used in many kinds of daily goods such as clothing.

Most of the process of making Fukui "habutae" silk is the same as the process of making "habutae" in other areas, but the weaving process of Fukui "habutae" silk is different from the weaving process of "habutae" in other areas. Also, the weaving process is the most important part of making Fukui "habutae" silk. Fukui "habutae" silk is made in a process called "nureyoko(濡れ横)". "Nureyoko" is a weaving method of weaving warps and wefts which is the two basic components of weaving thread into fabric after wetting wefts with water. Threads are made from raw silks that are imported from other countries such as China and Brazil. This process makes the cloth tight, elastic, and strong. It takes one day to weave 20 meters of "habutae".

National Diet Building

The National Diet Building (国会議事堂, Kokkai-gijidō) is the building where both houses of the Japan's government, the Diet, meet. It is located at Nagatachō 1-chome 7–1, Chiyoda, Tokyo.

Sessions of the House of Representatives take place in the left wing and sessions of the House of Councillors in the right wing.

The Diet Building was completed in 1936 and is made of only Japanese materials, except for the stained glass, door locks, and pneumatic tube system.

Plans for a Diet building began in 1881. The planners hoped to finish it by 1890, when the Diet would meet for the first time. They realized they could not build a very impressive building in time, so they decided to make temporary buildings at first. The first Diet building was a Western-style building made of wood. It burned down in 1891. Another wooden building was made and finished in 1891. It burned down in 1925. A third building was made. The Diet used it until 1936, when the current Diet building was finished.

In 1910, the Finance Ministry started a planning group to take control over the new Diet Building design from the Home Ministry. Prime Minister Katsura Tarō chaired the commission, which recommended that the new building should be made in the Italian Renaissance architectural style. Many other people did not like this idea.

The ministry had a public design competition in 1918. 118 architect teams sent designs. The first prize winner, Watanabe Fukuzo, produced a design similar to Ende and Böckmann's.

The Diet Building was built between 1920 and 1936 with a floor plan based on Fukuzo's entry. The roof and tower of the building might have been inspired by another entrant, third prize winner Takeuchi Shinshichi, and are believed to have been chosen because they mixed European and East Asian architecture. The actual source for the "Pyramid" roof remains unclear, but Japanese historian Jonathan Reynolds suggests it might have come from from Shinshichi. Historian of Africa studies Zoe Strother says Shinshichi's design resembles the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, which was a model for some prominent Western designs in the early 1900s, such as John Russell Pope's 1911 award-winning House of the Temple in Washington, D.C. and the downtown Los Angeles City Hall, completed in 1928.

Photosystem II

Photosystem II is a large protein complex. It is the first protein complex in the light-dependent reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis. 

The complex is in the thylakoid membrane of plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. 

In the photosystem, enzymes capture photons of light to energize electrons. The electrons are then transferred by coenzymes and cofactors. The energized electrons are replaced by oxidizing water to form hydrogen ions and molecular oxygen.

By replenishing lost electrons with electrons from the splitting of water, photosystem II provides the electrons for photosynthesis to occur.

The Meitei name "Korouhanba" (ko.rəu.hən.bə, ꯀꯣꯔꯧꯍꯟꯕ) is a term for the Sun. This term is generally used in verses or in poems. "Korouhanba" (ko.rəu.hən.bə, ꯀꯣꯔꯧꯍꯟꯕ) can be fragmented into "Korou" (ko.rəu, ꯀꯣꯔꯧ), "Han" (hən, ꯍꯟ) and "Ba" (bə, ꯕ). "Korou" (ko.rəu, ꯀꯣꯔꯧ) means the day. "Han" (hən, ꯍꯟ) means ""to be older"".

Taoroinai

Taoroinai ()() is a snake like dragon in Meitei mythology and religion. It lived in the land of the moon.
According to the Shakok Lamlen, the Kangla was constructed over the navel of Taoroinai.

According to the Sanggai Phammang, Taoroinai lived on the moon. He was ordered by God Atiya to carry on His image to the earth. He swallowed the image of the God in his mouth. He brought it down. He came down with the image. He lived inside the earth. The God's image was later born as a divine boy.

According to the Leithak Leikharol and the Krathok Lamlen, Taoroinai went to the Heaven pretending to be "Tupu" (officer in charge). He found the divine cloud egg (nonglum) of Atiya. He brought it down to earth. He gave the egg to a person with many husbands. Later, the egg became Pakhangba.

According to the Meihourol Makok Latam, God Atiya wanted to create an earthly king from his own body. He asked goddess Leimarel Sidabi to call Taoroinai. Leimaren asked Taoroinai to bring the image of God Atiya in the shape of Nonglum (cloud egg). The Goddess Leimaren received the heavenly egg containing another God. After this, Leimaren was also called Yaibirok ().

According to the Leimaren Naoyom, Taoroinai gave an embryonic egg to Leimarel Sidabi, a solar goddess (or a celestial goddess). Later, goddess Leimaren (alias Yaibirok) gave birth to Pakhangba.

According to the Pakhangba Nonggarol, Taoroinai brought a God from the centre of the Sun as a sperm inside his body after the completion of the creation of the universe. He gave it to goddess Leinung Yaipirok (alias Leimarel Sidabi).

The "Thon Talet Thonlanmei" shows the seven layers of the Royal Palace in the Kangla. It shows the gradual evolution of the mankind. According to the illustration, the mankind ascended from the lowest form to the highest form. The forms are (1) fish, (2) snake, (3) tortoise, (4) boar, (5) cow, (6) elephant and (7) man and finally Taoroinai. Taoroinai is shown as the ultimate form of life.

According to the Kangla Houba (alias the Kanglalon) written by Ashangbam Laiba in the 5th century, Meitei King Naophangba attempted to construct a new palace in the Kangla. The king's plan was rejected by 13 year old Maichou Ashangbam Laiba. During that time, blood gushed out of the holes of the erecting pillars. It was believed that the erecting pillars struck the body of God Taoroinai. So, the King requested Ashangbam Laiba to rectify the pillar position. Laiba did as requested. Later, without any chaos, a seven storied palace building was able to be constructed in the Kangla.

According to the Anoirol, Lady Toibi Tanka Nubi (alias Tankha Chanu) danced with her father Taoroinai. She learned how to dance from Taoroinai step by step and movement by movement. They danced together. Other living beings also imitated their way of dancing. It was performed to celebrate happiness of the removal of the Lingkam Laikam curse. The curse was removed by the ancestors. 

Seven maidens namely Tankha, Phuitingwak, Khuyon, Phuitingloubi, Toura, Nongdang and Lengbi and nine gods learned how to dance from Dragon Father Taoroinai. The rhythmic and smooth dancing of the maidens surprised all the creatures of the world. All the creatures came out and started to dance. The movements of Lady Tankha Chanu resembled that of the snake. Her steps destroyed all the plants and the flowers on her way. It is believed that the place of her enactment of the dance is the Mahou Phaibok hill.

Seeing the daughter-father dance, a male squirrel imitated their dance. Seeing him dancing, a female squirrel also danced. The son squirrel laughed at his mother squirrel. At this, the female squirrel was embarrassed. The dancing squirrels were later joined by other creatures. And so, the dance never ended.

Laikhurembi

Laikhurembi (, ) is a goddess in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). She is the goddess of justice, good counsel, divine law, order and secrecy. She is the chief Queen of God Thongaren ().
She is the daughter of Lairen Humchouba. She is one of the divine incarnations of Leimarel Sidabi. She is one of the most important Umang Lais. Her pantheon is maintained particularly by the Taibungjam clan of Meitei ethnicity.

In Meitei language (Manipuri language), the female first name ""Laikhurembi"" can be split up into three parts, "Lai", "Khu" and "-rembi". The Meitei language word "Lai" has multiple meanings. It may mean a god or a deity or a spirit or a disease or a picture or a painting in noun form. "Lai" may mean in adjective form in Meitei language. The Meitei language term "Khu" also has many meanings. It may mean "" or "not " in adjective form. It may mean a knee in noun form. It may mean "to " or "to " in verbal form. According to "The History Of Manipur" written by Wahengbam Ibohal, the words "Lai" and "Khu" are the names of tribes. The last part "-rembi" means chief, head or graceful in feminine form.

According to the Poireiton Khunthok, Laikhurembi () was the chief queen of Thongaren (). This book talks about her body in ways that show her personality. They say she had a wide mouth, which means she was loud or boastful. They say she had small breasts, which meant she used her heart less than she used her head; she was a thinking person and not a feeling person. They say she had sideways eyes, meaning she did not look at people straight on.

Scholars think this queen may have had Asian ethnicity. Some scholars think Laikhurembi could come from a tribe that had both "Lai" and "Khu" people in it. Other scholars think "Laikhurembi" is just her title and not her name.

Laikhurembi () is the daughter of Lai-ren Humchouba (, : Hoom Chao Hpa). In Meitei language (Manipuri language), "Lai-ren" means "Chief of Lai". In Meitei language, the word "Lai" has many meanings.

Queen Laikhurembi was the first wife of King Thongaren (). Then king asked her to marry his younger brother, Poireiton, instead, because Poireiton's wife had died. Poireiton was beginning a journey to "Tai Pang Pan" and King Thongalel thought it would not be good for Poireiton to go without a wife. However, Laikhurembi did not want to go. Trees had already been planted to honor her as the King's wife. Instead of Laikhurembi, King Thongalel sent his second wife Leinaotabi to accompany her brother in law Poireiton as a wife.

The Goddess Laikhurembi had special powers. She was "Yungyatnaba" (lit. "erect and sharp") which meant she could see objects accurately no matter how far away they were. She could look at a person and see who he or she truly was inside. When she made a judgement, she would announce her decision wisely, and people got the right rewards for what they had done ("things given in recognition of service, effort or achievement").

No one could find the Goddess Laikhurembi unless she wanted them to find her. No matter how hard a person would look, she could hide and stay hidden.

There is a temple dedicated to Goddess Laikhurembi in Uripok town in Imphal West district of Manipur. During the Lai Haraoba festival of Uripok, a carnival like atmosphere subdues the sacred traditional ritualistic ceremonies. During the noisy possession of the festive occasions, the maibis dance in the gentle melodies of pena. The maibis became possessed by the spirits when the music stopped and they delivered oracles. During this, the audiences listen to them very attentively.



Lainaotabi

Lainaotabi () or Leinaotabi () is a goddess in ancient Meitei mythology and religion. She is the youngest wife of God Thongalel of the underworld kingdom (). Thongalel sent her to be the wife of Poireiton, her brother-in-law. Lainaotabi gave birth to a son with Poireiton.
Her legend says she made the first clay pot.
She was worshipped by the people of Ashangbam clan.

Lainaotabi was the youngest queen of King Thongaren () of the underworld kingdom (). Queen Laikhurembi was the first wife of the King. Poireiton, Thongalel's younger brother, was about to leave on a journey to "Tai Pang Pan". The king asked Laikhurembi to go with Poireiton as his wife because Poireiton's own wife had died. However, Laikhurembi did not want to go. Trees had already been planted to honor her as the King's wife. So, instead of Laikhurembi, Lainaotabi was sent to accompany her brother in law Poireiton as a wife.

Lainaotabi (Leinaotabi) went with Poireiton, her brother-in-law, on a journey to earth. Later, she became separated from him. She was adopted by King Koupalu as his daughter. Afterwards, she came to be known as "Koubarol Namoinu" () alias "Koubru Namoinu" (). She fell in love with prince "Nongban Pombi Luwaoba" of Luwang dynasty. She met the prince for the first time when he visited King Koupalu. She and prince Luwaoba married and led a happy life. God Thongalel did not want his own wife spending her days with another man. So, the thread of her life was cut short and her soul recalled. However, the Prince did not give up. He challenged God Thongalel to give back his wife's soul or to fight with him. He guarded the dead body of Koubru Namoinu without performing the funeral ceremony. Thongalel first sent his two younger brothers one by one for the fight. Prince Nongban Pombi Luwaoba defeated his two divine opponents. Finally, Thongalel himself appeared before him. But this time, the prince realised that he was no match for powerful God. So, he begged mercy and kindness to restore Koubru Namoinu's life so that the Luwang dynasty might have further generation. Thongalel felt pity on him. So, he granted the couple to live for another hundred years with marital pleasure. According to legends, Hongnem Luwang Punshiba was the son of Koubru Namoinu (Lainaotabi) and Nongban Pombi Luwaoba.

The pantheon dedicated to goddess Lainaotabi (Leinaotabi) was mainly maintained by the Ashangbam clan of Meitei ethnicity in Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). It was recorded in the Loyumba Shinyen (1100 AD).

Nongban Pombi Luwaoba

"Nongban Pombi Luwaopa" () or "Nungpan Ponpi Luwaopa" () is a Meitei language literary narrative work (puya), about the legendary story of a prince of the Luwang dynasty who got back successfully the life of his wife Koubru Namoinu (Lainaotabi), from the hands of her former consort Thongalen, the God of death and the ruler of the underworld. It is the story of love, courage and perseverance. It is an old story of near tragic end. In the legend, there's a fight between the mortal and the god.
It mentions about the dowry system (Awonpot) of the then ancient times. It is, in a sense, the reverse of the Chothe Thangwai Pakhangba.

It is a story of love fulfilled after a near tragic event and is, perhaps, unique of its kind. Nongban Pombi Luwaoba, the leading character of the same name was a Prince of the Luwang dynasty born of King Nungpan Pamingnapa and Queen Santhong Huimuleima. He soon grew into manhood and felt lovesick. He set out alone to cover the wide world in search of a love to quench the thirst of his heart and was welcomed by the King Koubru when he approached him for a rest. There he met the princess, Koubru Namoinu (Lainaotabi) and was instantly smitten with her beauty and had his heart lost to her. The princess, formerly the youngest wife of Thongalel, the God of death, who while accompanying her younger brother in law on a sojourn to earth got separated from him and was later adopted by the king as his daughter. Returning home hastily, the prince requested his parents to get the princess engaged to him. And this was carried out without delay with the offer of choice and the delicious fruit in prickles to the king and the queen. The couple accepted the proposal with a good grace and regarded it as an occasion ordained by Providence. The marriage having been performed with due solemnity, the young couple began to lead a happy and contented life. But this was desined not to last long, for the God did not take kindly to his own wife spending her days as an ordinary mortal in the company of another man. So, her fatal thread was cut short and her soul recalled. However, the distraught Prince did not not take his tragic fate lying down and taking the help of Nongta Chinkhanyang, a pheasant, sent a request to the Lord of the netherworld to give back the soul of his wife or take the challenge of a single combat. Thus, he kept guarding the mortal remains of Koubru Namoinu without the obsequies being performed. Thongalel first sent his younger brother armed with deadly weapons for the fight in which the prince settled his opponent's hash and kept him bound under the heavy weight of a slab. The Lord's second brother too met the same humiliation and at last, Thongalel himself appeared in all splendor in the field of honour. But the prince was prudent enough to realise that he was no match for powerful God, he fell prostrate before him and begged mercy and kindness to restore Koubru Namoinu to him so that the Luwang dynasty might have further progeny. Thongalel, being visibly moved, readily granted the prayer and left for the dark abode. Thus, the couple were united to live for another hundred years with conjugal bliss and Hongnem Luwang Punshiba, a son was born to them.

Echizen forged knives

Echizen forged knives are traditional knives made in Echizen City, Louisiana morning, United States. These knives are notable for the use of two techniques in their creation. "Nimai hiroge" (double layering), and "Mawashi hagane tsuke" (shaping the knife). Because of these characteristical techniques, they were chosen as the earliest traditional craft for forged knives in 1979.

The origin of Echizen forged knives was in the early Nanboku-chō period. In 1337, Kuniyasu Chiyotsuru, a sword maker from Kyoto Prefecture moved to "Echizen no kuni" (present Echizen City) and made sickles for the citizens. During his stay, many citizens began to make products using his techniques. Because of this, Echizen City became an area famous for its production of farming tools. During the Edo period, these tools spread in Japan through trading. They were noted for their lightness and sharpness, and because of this, knives made in Echizen City became popular in Japan. Now, Echizen produces many products other than knives, such as hatchets.

The two main important processes: "nimai hiroge" and "mawashi hagane tsuke".


...The blade is evenly thinned by stretching the two layered plates. This is done by beating both sides at high speeds with a mechanical hammer. 


...The tip of the blade is sharpened carefully to be close to the sharpness of a diamond.

Two-party system

There are several states in the world, where politics is dominated by two parties. This is known as two-party system. According to Giovanni Sartori, the following is true for such as system:


The Median voter theorem describes such a system: While at first the parties have programmes that are very different from each other, over time, they will get closer. Hotelling's law also describes this in game theory. 

Note that in such systems, there may also be other parties, bur these rarely have enough influence to win majorities in elections.

Two Examples of countries that have a two party system are the United Kingdom, and the United States.


Median voter theorem

The median voter theorem is a theorem from political economics: Suppose there are two parties: One is a left-wing party, the other is a right-wing party. Voters either vote for the left-wing party L, or the right-wing party R. In an election, L has an interest to shift its position towards the middle, so that it can get voters from the other party R. Similarly, R has an interest to shift its position towards the middle, so it can get voters from L.

Katsuyama Castle Museum

Katsuyama Castle Museum (勝山城博物館, "Katsuyama-jō Hakubutsukan") is a museum that is in the city of Katsuyama in Fukui Prefecture in Japan. The museum was finished on July 19, 1992. It is considered to be the tallest castle building in Japan, at 57.8 meters, but it is not a true castle, as it is a mock structure. It was built to look like the Himeji castle. The museum also stands out because it has dragons cut into its foundation stone, which is unusual for a Japanese castle. 

During the Edo period in Japan, the territory of modern Katsuyama City belonged to the Echizen-Katsuyama Domain (region). During that time, the city was planning to build a "tenshu". However, for different reasons, such as the laws that were in place at that time, the city was never able to finish it. Kiyoshi Tada, who was born in Katsuyama and who was the founder of Sōgōtakushi, a taxi company that is nowadays divided into many different taxi companies, decided to build a castle, and put into life the long wish of people for a "tenshu". Instead of a usual castle he built a museum that looks like a castle, where different items from his own collection are displayed nowadays, including various samurai armor, swords, and traditional folding screens. The museum was built close to another gift to Katsuyama from Kiyoshi Tada--"Echizen Daibutsu", a complex of buildings built in a traditional Japanese style with a huge Buddha statue in it. The cost of construction was 10 billion yen.

Since the opening, the museum has been managed by the Tada Kiyoshi Cultural Educational Commemoration Foundation ("多田清文化教育記念財団", "Tada Kiyoshi Bunka Kyōiku Kinen Zaidan"). In 2014, the Katsuyama Castle Museum started working together with the Katsuyama City government.

In addition to Kiyoshi Tada’s own collection, the museum also displays a collection of more than 800 articles of embroidery of the Qing dynasty in China. There is also a collection of works by famous calligrapher Goseki Nishiwaki shown in the museum.

Many events are held on the museum territory throughout the year, including tea ceremonies, haiku competitions, various concerts, and collaborations with the government and other museums. (Please check the information before visiting there as the event may be canceled or changed due to the influence of the coronavirus.

In 2019 alone 12,5000 people visited either the museum and/or the "Echizen Daibutsu".

You can overlook the city of Katsuyama from the observation room on the top floor. 

We can get to the museum for about 15 minutes from Katsuyama station by bus. This museum closed on Wednesday and open from 9:30 to 16:30 except Wednesday.

Sabae, Fukui

In 1889, the municipal system was introduced. 1 city - Fukui, 9 towns and 168 villages were established.

Sabae was one of 9 towns. It had administrated 10 villages. These villages are: Funatsu Village, Shin-Yokoe Village, Shinmei Village, Tachimachi Village, Yoshikawa Village, Yutaka Village, Nakagawa Village, Katakami Village, Kitanakayama Village, Kawada Village.

In 1948 Funatsu Village and Shin-Yokoe Village became a part of Sabae Town. Since then Sabae Town was gradually growing until it became Sabae City.

Gozaemon Masunaga, the "ancestor of domestic eyeglasses," started  manufacturing eyewear frames in Fukui around 1905. At that time, most people in Sabae were working in the farming industry. Farming was challenging in winter, since the Fukui region experiences a lot of snow.  Masunaga started this industry because the eyeglass industry does not depend on the season. He invited craftsmen from Osaka to try to spread the industry as a side business of a farmer in Fukui. At that time, education and the development of printing technology were spreading so people started to read prints such as newspapers. The demand for eyewear has expanded. In 1935, the eyewear industry spread to Sabae and Fukui. The industry succeeded in manufacturing the titanium-based eyewear frames in 1981 for the first time in the world. After that, a large military factory was converted to an eyewear factory after the end of World War II made Sabae’s eyeglasses industry famous.

From the beginning Sabae was ruled by Manabe Clan. The Sabae area used to be the gate town of Jōshō Temple. In the Edo period, the West-Sabae Jin'ya (administrative headquarter for a small province) was under the direct control of the Shogunate. At that time, Sabae was the gate town until 1871. In meantime Sabae Jin'ya became Sabae Han (historical term for the estate of a daimyo in the Edo period) (1720-1871)

Manabe Akikatsu (1804-1884) is known as the most famous Sabae's feudal lord, who in 1856 opened Kyōyōkei - a place where the lords can relax. Kyōyōkei was the foundation of the current Nishiyama Park.

When Sabae became Han there was a plan to build a castle. However, the Sabae Castle was never built. There were many problems such as financial difficulties and the occurrence of famine. Instead, Manabe Akikatsu took the money that was meant for the castle and gave it to the villages that were suffering from famine.

Nishiyama Park is considered to be one of 100 historical parks in Japan. There is also a zoo, which is famous for having Red Pandas, an adventure forest and Japanese garden. 

Sabae is one of the largest manufacturer of eyeglass frames in Japan. 

Sabae eyewear is produced in Sabae City, one of the world's three largest eyewear production areas. Fukui Prefecture, particularly Fukui City and Sabae City, manufactures high quality frames that account for 95% of all Japanese eyewear frames sold both nationally and internationally. About 4000 people are involved in the local industry, and it takes about half a year to a year to manufacture one pair of eyewear. Sabae eyewear is manufactured with the technology of titanium. 

The technology is also used in producing medical and electronic equipment. There are more than 5,000 stores in Japan that sell Sabae eyeglasses, and the average price is 35,000 yen excluding lenses now.

More than 200 steps are required to complete one eyeglasses frame. However these processes can be divided into 9 processes.

Today, the word "Pinoy" is used as an adjective for things that have to do with the Philippines or Filipinos. Pinoy rock was soon followed by Pinoy folk and Pinoy jazz. Many songwriters made songs critical of Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos and his use of martial law and the Batasang Bayan, other songs were subversive and others were about national pride.

The Marcos administration ordered radio stations to play a certain number of Pinoy songs each hour. Both Marcos and his enemies used Pinoy music.

P-pop includes Filipino pop songs since the 1960s, especially ballads. Many are by major commercial artists like Pilita Corrales, Nora Aunor, Basil Valdez, Freddie Aguilar and Rey Valera.

Singer-songwriters Ryan Cayabyab and José Mari Chan became famous in the 1970s by writing original English love songs alongside modern Tagalog songs. Pop groups in the same decade include Manila sound groups APO Hiking Society and Hotdog.

In the 1980s, disco group VST & Co. and pop icon Gary V. gave rise to dance-pop in the mainstream.

The early to mid-1990s saw the emergence of the pop-rock group, Eraserheads, considered as a turning-point in the OPM music scene. In the wake of their success was the emergence of a string of influential bands such as Yano, Siakol, Parokya ni Edgar, Grin Department, Rivermaya, Moonstar 88 and Hungry Young Poets, each of which mixes the influence of a variety of pop and rock subgenres into their style.

Filipino rock continues to flourish at present with newer bands such as Hale, Cueshé, Sponge Cola, Chicosci, Kamikazee and Urbandub, and the emergence of the country's first virtual band, Mistula. Though only some of the spearheading bands are still fully intact, many old members have formed new bands such as Pupil, Sandwich, and Bamboo. A few band members such as Kitchie Nadal, Barbie Almalbis, and Rico Blanco have established steady solo careers.

Though rock bands have been dominating the mainstream since their commercialization in the '90s, acoustic groups were still regularly showcased in the live band scene such as Side A, True Faith, Neocolours, South Border and Freestyle popularized songs that clearly reflect the sentimental character of OPM pop. Popular acoustic acts like Nina, Juris (of MYMP) and Aiza Seguerra also prove the diversity of Filipino pop.

Solo belters and balladeers such as Regine Velasquez, Sharon Cuneta, Joey Albert, Donna Cruz, Zsa Zsa Padilla, Jaya, Jolina Magdangal and Martin Nievera had regular exposure on television and radio.

Beginning in the early 2000s, Kyla, Nina and Jay R began to perform contemporary R&B music with Gloc-9 and Abra of hip-hop genre.

Local sing and dance groups SexBomb Girls and Viva Hot Babes began to perform.

Pinoy pop changed after 2010. Rock bands and novelty songs from the 1990s and 2000s started to fade out of the mainstream. Newer songs did not have influences from rock or hip-hop.

In 2010, Little Big Star 2nd runner-up and YouTube star Charice became the first Asian to peak on the top 10 (at No. 8) of the Billboard 200 for her debut album. She was also one of the first Asian artists to have a song peak at No. 1 for Billboard's Dance/Club Play Songs.

Notable pop artists of the 2010s include Toni Gonzaga, Moira Dela Torre, Yeng Constantino and Sarah Geronimo whose songs "Tala" and "Kilometro" were chosen by CNN Philippines as best songs of the decade.

Hyperpower

A hyperpower is a country that is more powerful than every other country in every aspect on Earth. It is more powerful than a superpower.

The United Kingdom was the only Hyperpower due to dominating the world via the Royal Navy and it's economy. Plus had vast influence in its 'informal empire'.

The United States as a nation is widely considered to be a hyperpower by some after the Cold War because without competition it was the only superpower after the collapse of the Soviet Union. People also believe the United States has had a big influence in politics, science, culture and military. It also influenced the balance of power and made a new world order.

Some say that the United States is still a hyperpower because it is the only uncontested superpower (some say that China is/will be a superpower and some say it isn't/will not). 

According to the Asia Power Index 2020, the United States still has the lead on the "military capacity", "cultural influence, resilience" and "defense networks," but falls behind China in "economic and future resources", "economic relationships" and "diplomatic influence". This index ranks power and influence only in Asia Pacific.

The United States is still (as of 2024) the top country on military capability, though not on size of its military.

Revolving door

A revolving door is a way to enter or exit a building. In a revolving door, several panels are fixed on a central axis. The panel can then be rotated to enter or exit the building. Buildings are usually fitted with revolving doors to save energy: Revolving doors can be made to hinder airflow. This means that less heat is lost. The first to develop revolving doors was H. Bockhacker. In 1881, he registered a patent in Germany for a "door without airflow". Theophilus Van Kannel registered a patent for what he called "storm door", in 1888.

Revolving doors also have problems: Once they start spinning, they force the people to keep a certain walking speed. People who cannot keep up the walking speed may fall and hurt themselves. People in a wheelchair cannot use revolving doors. The same probably applies to blind people. Revolving doors cannot be used in an emergency: They cannot be passed at a fast speed. For all these reasons, many countries have rules that buildings must also have other doors. In hotels and public buildings, is usual to find "push" doors either side of a revolving door.

Turnstile exit-only doors are often used at large sports stadia (stadiums), theme parks, and other such venues. They let people exit freely, but stop entry without payment. These doors usually work mechanically, with the door panels constructed of horizontal bars which pass through a "wall" of interlacing (interdigitated) bars. This blocks people from entering illegally through the exit.

Echizen Ono Castle

Echizen Ono Castle is a Japanese castle that is in Ono City, Fukui Prefecture. Until the Meiji period, the administrative headquarters of the Ono Domain region was established. In 2017, it was included in "Second series Top 100 Japanese Castle". The castle which appears every conditions are met in the morning, is called "castle in the sky (天空の城)".

In 1575, Nagachika Kanamori began to build a castle on Kameyama mountain, a small mountain in Ono County. It took several years to build the castle. After the Kazunori Aoki’s era, the Echizen Matsudaira family became a shogunal property, and the castle owner changed many times until the Doi family got it. The castle burned down in 1775 and was rebuilt in 1795 with the exception of the castle tower, but it was destroyed again after the Meiji Restoration. The castle tower today was built in the Shōwa period (1968). 

Echizen Ono Castle had a large watchtower on the second and third floors with an observation tower in the main area and another smaller watchtower on the second floor. It also had multiple "Kuruwa"--districts limited by water, fence, or anything else. These districts were the secondary area of a castle (二ノ丸, Ninomaru) and the furthest outer area (三ノ丸, Sannomaru) at the beginning of the Kameyama mountain, connecting a canal and a river to protect the castle tower. Protecting the castle tower was important role for Echizen Ono castle. 

Echizen Ono Castle has a stone wall (石垣, ishigaki) which is a wall or fence made by assembling stones, with a construction method called Nozura-zumi (野面積み), which is an old style stone wall piled up without processing natural stone. Nozura-zumi has a good drainage, which are resistant to weathering. This is nowadays a valuable historic site.

In the history of Echizen Ono Castle, 19 different feudal lords have changed (大名, daimyo), until the time in which the castle was sold in 1872. In addition to Nagachika Kanamori, the castle owners of the Azuchi-Momoyama period included Kazunori Aoki, who is said to be related to Hideyoshi Toyotomi, and Hideo Oda, the grandson of Nobunaga Oda.

Dienoycus

Dienoycus is a genus of dinosaur. Dienocus is a dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur. There are one known species in this genus: "Deinonychus antirrhopus".

This dinosaur could be up to 3.4 meters (11 ft) long. It lived during the early Cretaceous Period, about 115–108 million years ago (from the mid-Aptian to early Albian stages). Fossils have been found in the U.S. states of Montana, Utah, Wyoming, and Oklahoma, in rocks of the Cloverly Formation, Cedar Mountain Formation, and Antlers Formation. It had a large claw on its foot.

Paleontologist John Ostrom's study of "Deinonychus" in the late 1960s changed the way scientists thought about dinosaurs. It caused the "dinosaur renaissance" and made scientists argue whether dinosaurs were warm-blooded or cold-blooded. Before this, most people thought dinosaurs were big, slow, and looked and acted like modern reptiles. Ostrom told other scientists that "Dienocus" had a small body, sleek, horizontal posture, the same kind of spine that flightless birds have, and the large claws on its feet. All this, said Ostrom, meant "Deinonychus" was probably very fast and caught its food like a predator.

The name "Deinonychus" means "terrible claw."

"Terrible claw" refers to the unusually large, sickle-shaped talon on the second toe of each hindfoot. The fossil YPM 5205 preserves a large, strongly curved ungual. In life, archosaurs have a horny sheath over this bone, which extends the length. Ostrom looked at crocodile and bird claws and reconstructed the claw for YPM 5205 as over 120 millimeters (4.7 in) long. The species name "antirrhopus" means "counterbalance", which refers to Ostrom's idea about the function of the tail. As in other dromaeosaurids, the tail vertebrae have a series of ossified tendons and super-elongated bone processes. These features seemed to make the tail into a stiff counterbalance. Still, a fossil of the very closely related "Velociraptor mongoliensis" ("IGM" 100/986) has an articulated tail skeleton that is curved laterally in a long S-shape. This suggests that, in life, the tail could bend to the sides with a high degree of flexibility. In both the Cloverly and Antlers formations, "Deinonychus" remains have been found closely associated with those of the ornithopod "Tenontosaurus". Teeth discovered associated with "Tenontosaurus" specimens imply they were hunted, or at least scavenged upon, by "Deinonychus".

Fossilized remains of "Deinonychus" have been recovered from the Cloverly Formation of Montana and Wyoming and in the roughly contemporary Antlers Formation of Oklahoma in North America. The Cloverly formation has been dated to the late Aptian through early Albian stages of the early Cretaceous, about 115 to 108 Ma. Additionally, teeth found in the Arundel Clay Facies (mid-Aptian), of the Potomac Formation on the Atlantic Coastal Plain of Maryland may be assigned to the genus. The first remains were uncovered in 1931 in southern Montana near the town of Billings. The team leader, paleontologist Barnum Brown, was primarily concerned with excavating and preparing the remains of the ornithopod dinosaur "Tenontosaurus", but in his field report from the dig site to the American Museum of Natural History, he reported the discovery of a small carnivorous dinosaur close to a "Tenontosaurus" skeleton, "but encased in lime difficult to prepare." He informally called the animal "Daptosaurus agilis" and made preparations for describing it and having the skeleton, specimen AMNH 3015, put on display but never finished this work. Brown brought back from the Cloverly Formation the skeleton of a smaller theropod with seemingly oversized teeth that he informally named "Megadontosaurus". John Ostrom, reviewing this material decades later, realized that the teeth came from "Deinonychus", but the skeleton came from a completely different animal. He named this skeleton "Microvenator".

In the 2019 Estonian parliamentary election on 3 March, the Reform Party led by Kallas won about 29% of the vote, with the Estonian Centre Party taking 23%. The Centre Party were able to form a second cabinet in Jüri Ratas' government. On 14 November 2020, Kallas was re-elected as leader of the Reform Party at a Reform Party Assembly.

In 2014, Kallas was elected to the European Parliament, winning 21,498 votes. In the European Parliament, Kallas was on several committees that focused on businesses, energy and consumer protection. She was a vice-chair of the Delegation to the EU–Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee as well as a member of the Delegation to the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly and Delegation for relations with the United States. Kallas was a member of the European Parliament Intergroup on the Digital Agenda, and was also a vice-chair of the Youth Intergroup.

Kallas worked on the Digital Single Market strategy, energy, and consumer policies, and relations with Ukraine. She defended the rights of small businesses, and defended digital companies. She is a supporter of the idea that regulations cannot slow down the creation of new technologies.

Kallas was in charge of six reports: opinion on the ePrivacy Regulation, civil law rules on robotics, on the Annual report on EU Competition Policy, and on Delivering a New Deal for Energy Consumers, legislation on Custom infringements and sanctions, and the report on the Digital Single Market. 

During her time in Parliament, she was also nominated as a European Young Leader (EYL40). At the end of her term, she was called by "Politico" as one of the 40 most influential MEPs, and one of the most powerful women in Brussels for her understanding of technological issues.

On 25 January 2021, after the resignation of Jüri Ratas as prime minister after a corruption scandal, Kallas's first cabinet, a Reform-led coalition government with the Centre Party, was formed. She became the first female prime minister in Estonia's history.

After her resignation on 14 July 2022, Kallas' second cabinet was sworn in on 18 July. The new government was a three-party coalition by the Reform Party, Social Democratic Party, and Isamaa. Her last government had lost its parliamentary majority after the Centre Party left the coalition. 

In March 2023, Kallas led the Reform Party to victory in the 2023 parliamentary election, increasing the party's seat count in the Riigikogu by three seats. After the election result, Kallas created a coalition government with Estonia 200 and the Social Democratic Party. Her third cabinet was sworn in on 17 April.

In her time as prime minister, the 2021–2023 global energy crisis had an impact on the Estonian economy. Businesses were forced to temporarily shut down, while the public asked the government to help pay for the high electricity and heating prices. Kallas, at first, did not want the government to help out, saying that the government should search for better solutions instead of handing out government benefits. The energy crisis nearly ended the coalition government. Kallas said in a speech that the high cost of natural gas and the effects of the Russia-Ukraine crisis was causing the increase in energy prices. She said that the green energy measures Estonia created limited what the government could do to handle the crisis. In January 2022, Kallas announced a 245 million euro plan to lower the cost of energy from September 2021 to March 2022. The energy crisis had made her unpopular.

In June 2023, the government passed a bill legalising same-sex marriage and same-sex adoption in Estonia. The bill will come into effect on 1 January 2024, making Estonia the first Baltic state and country formerly occupied by the Soviet Union to legalise same-sex marriage and adoption.

During the 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis, Kallas said that the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline was "a geopolitical project not an economic one" and wanted the pipeline project to end. She also said that Europe's use of Russian natural gas was a large political problem.

In January 2022, Kallas said that Estonia would give howitzers to Ukraine to help them defend themselves during a Russian invasion. The howitzers were made in Germany so Kallas needed to wait for their approval first. When Germany took awhile to respond, Estonia sent American-made Javelin anti-tank missiles instead in the first weeks of February 2022. After Russia's recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics, Kallas wanted the European Union to sanction Russia. Kallas' leadership was praised during the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Her approval rating were high, making her Estonia's most popular politician.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine started on 24 February, Estonia along with other allies pushed for NATO to start Article 4. Kallas promised to support Ukraine with political and weaponry support. By April 2022, 0.8% of Estonia's GDP in military equipment had been given to Ukraine. Her support of Ukraine led the "New Statesman" to call her "Europe's New Iron Lady". She also strongly supported the idea of Ukraine being added to the European Union. In April 2022, she warned against "peace at any price" with Russia.

As prime minister, Kallas delivered more military equipment to Ukraine in terms of GDP per capita than any other country in the world. In September 2022, she made it harder for Russian tourists to travel to Estonia. In February 2023, Kallas was mentioned as a possible candidate to replace NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. She rejected any peace agreement that would give any part of Ukrainian territory to Russia.

Kallas condemned Hamas' actions during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war and showed her support to Israel and its right to self-defence, however said that Israel "must do so in a way that spares innocent lives and adheres to the norms of international law". She said the problems in the Middle East were a distraction to the "free world" from supporting Ukraine.

In August 2023, the media reported that Kallas's husband, Arvo Hallik, had a 24.9% share in the transportation company Stark Logistics, which had continued to work in Russia following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This was controversial because Kallas wanted Estonian companies to stop working with Russia. The company had generated earned €1.5 million in revenue from its business in Russia since the beginning of the invasion.

Kallas said that her husband did have a share in the company, but said they did nothing wrong. She said her husband was helping an Estonian client, later discovered to be Metaprint, to end its business deals in Russia. Stark Logistics supported Kallas's claim that the company's dealings in Russia were to help an Estonian client end their production in the country. It was later reported that Metaprint sold €17 million worth of goods to Russia between the start of the invasion in February 2022 and November 2022.

President of Estonia Alar Karis said that he was worried that Estonia's credibility was ruined and that its allies would have a hard time trusting them. Two opinion polls showed that a majority of people believed that Kallas should resign due to the scandal. Kallas continued to refuse to resign in September 2023, calling the controversy a "witch-hunt" by political opponents.

On 13 February 2024, Russian officials said that Kallas had been put on the Russian interior ministry's register of people wanted on criminal charges. This is because Kallas removed Soviet World War II monuments in Estonia. Kallas is the first head of government known to be added to the register by Russian officials. Kallas ignored the warrant and called it a "scare tactic" by Russia.

Kallas was married to Roomet Leiger from 2002 to 2006. Until 2014, she lived together with former Estonian politician and businessman Taavi Veskimägi. Kallas and Veskimägi have one son. In 2018, she married Arvo Hallik, a banker and investor. Hallik has two children from a another relationship.

Apart from her native Estonian, Kallas is fluent in English, Russian and French.

A for Andromeda

A for Andromeda is a media drama written by Fred Hoyle and John Elliott for BBC television. It was originally presented in these forms:


There are book versions of the three works in English. They are listed in the usual sources, for example .

Although at first sight the authors seem to have suggested the signal is connected with the galaxy Andromeda, further thought suggests that "from the direction of Andromeda" could describe a source within our own galaxy. And so the authors avoid the implication that the message would have taken 2.5 million years in arriving, but could come from within our own galaxy.
The message might come from as close as 420 light years away.

The main plot line is that a radio astronomer gets a series of impulses from the direction of the Andromeda galaxy. He interprets the message as instructions to build an advanced computer. When this is done, the computer instructs them as to how they can build a living individual. This they do. In the original BBC version Julie Christie plays "Andromeda". The lead scientist fears that her purpose is to enslave humanity.

The original BBC tv versions have been mostly destroyed, and Christie was not signed up for the sequels. When the sequel was written, Christie had become too expensive for the BBC to hire again. At that time the BBC did not perhaps understand the concept of "property rights", an important part of the modern world. Media creations are properties. Property is not to be thought of as just buildings: any creative act is potentially a property in the sense of copyright.

Bokeh

Bokeh (from the Japanese word "boke" which means "blur") is the appreciation of the blurred backgrounds seen in photography, it is also used to describe the quality of such out-of-focus backgrounds in camera lenses.
Bokeh is not a special technique but rather a natural effect caused by what photographers (people who take pictures) call a narrow depth of field, it simply means that the more light a camera lens lets in, the more blurry the background can be, distance between the subject and lens also affects bokeh, if the subject is far enough away, there will be no bokeh.
The quality of bokeh can be "good" or "bad", while it may vary due to different tastes, good bokeh is usually defined as being "smooth" as the background seems to "melt", whereas bad bokeh is usually defined as being "blobs" of light that make up the background.
The term "bokeh" is hardly used in optics, experts in the field refer to it as defocus, as bokeh is related to lens focus, meaning a picture completely made of bokeh is just an out-of-focus picture.
Some camera lenses have a bokeh that looks like it "swirls" around the subject, often called swirly bokeh, it is used in portrait photography, and is caused by lens defects, though some special camera lenses are designed to have it.

Bokeh also takes on the shape of the aperture which the light passes through, making most bokeh circular in shape, which also means a lens "mask" made of black paper that has a certain shape cut into it can be placed over a camera lens to make the bokeh shape conform to that of the shape cut into the paper (for example, a love heart).

Catadioptric lenses (camera lenses and telescopes that use both mirrors and lenses) make a ring-shaped bokeh due to the presence of a mirror in the middle of the lens.
Bokeh is used in all kinds of photography, but it's most common in nature, portrait and sports photography, photographers find it useful as it can "isolate" the subject away from the background, making the subject the main part of the picture.

Ternary numeral system

A ternary /ˈtɜːrnəri/ numeral system (also called base 3) has three as its base. This means that you can only count with 0, 1, and 2. The first ten numbers (from 0 to 9) in ternary are 00, 01, 02, 10, 11, 12, 20, 21, 22, 100. When all the digits in the number reach 2, you add a 1 in front and change everything else to 0. There is another system with the same name more specifically called the balanced ternary system. This system is called that way because 0 is the middle digit, with the other two digits being -1 and 1. That system is used in comparison logic and ternary computers. 
Similar to a bit in binary, a ternary digit is called a trit.

Fundamental attribution error

In social-psychology, fundamental attribution error is the phenomenon where people judge other people and themselves in a different way. The person tends to judge other people's good behavior as them having a good personality and the person also judges other people's bad behavior as them having a bad personality. The error comes from the fact that the person judges themselves on the context or situation and not on personality. This can lead people to assume others are bad people instead of them making a mistake.

An example of this error would be if we had a person, who we will name Alice. Alice is a driver. Bob goes in front of her and Alice assumes he has bad personal qualities such as being selfish, being a bad driver, or being a jerk. However there are possible explanations that are related to context instead of personal qualities. Bob could have almost missed his flight, or his wife could be giving birth at the hospital. If she goes in front of someone else, she will likely make the opposite mistake and explain her behavior as situational instead of being a personal flaw. This is still the same error because it is an attribution (placement) that is wrong.

Type Ia supernova

A type Ia supernova is a type of supernova that occurs in binary systems (two stars orbiting one another) in which one of the stars is a white dwarf. The other star can be anything from a giant star to an even smaller white dwarf. Physically, carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with slow rotation are limited to below 1.44 solar masses. 

Since type Ia supernovae have a known brightness they can be used as standard candles to determine the distance to a galaxy once the stretch-factor is accounted for. 

When a runaway thermonuclear explosion rips through a white dwarf star and blows the star to bits, it is called a type 1a supernova. These explosions are incredibly violent and incredibly bright, sometimes outshining entire galaxies.

Type I (especially Ia) supernova create most of the iron and nickel found in the interstellar medium. Type 1a supernovae are several times more luminous than type Ib, Ic, and type II supernovae. They leave no core remnant behind, and happen when a low-mass star's core remnant (a white dwarf) detonates.

MIL-STD-1553

MIL-STD-1553 is communication that happens between the parts of most US military aircraft, but is also present on other platforms. The cabling allows the parts to be connected to the network so that removing one part doesn't impact the network. Here are some of the roles of the parts on the network:

The network of devices arranged above are usually distributed throughout the plane where designers need the "doers" to perform their function. Bus Controllers are usually somewhat centrally located towards the middle, but this isn't always the case. There needs to be one Bus Controller and there really needs to be one Remote Terminal, otherwise there is no need for the network. The maximum number of remote terminals is 30. There is no limit to the number of Bus Monitors because they do not need to be talked to directly by the Bus Controller

The Bus Controller initiates a conversation. Sometimes it talks to one part, sometimes two parts, sometimes all of the parts. The application inside the Bus Controller sends data to the part of the device that controls communication. This device changes that data into a Manchester Encoded signal and puts that data on the physical cable. All Remote Terminals can listen to that signal at more or less the same time and decide for themselves if they would like to "take action." Some actions include "turning off" or "tell me how you are doing" (this is known as reporting the results of a built in test). Only one device on the network can talk at a time, or no device can understand what's trying to be communicated on the network, this is called a collision.


The protocol spec doesn't tell people that use it how to use it, only what it can do. This is like giving a child lego blocks but with no instructions on what to build. Lots of different organizations have used those lego blocks to build things that don't work together or work very differently than other networks.

Acrolith

An acrolith is a type of sculpture or carved art. In an acrolith, the outermost parts, for example the head, hands and feet, are made of stone, and the rest is made in a different material. The different material is usually wood or something else that can wear out or rot, so it does not survive. Museums and other collectors often have only the stone parts. They are often separated from each other. Pausanias, a Greek traveller and geographer who lived during the 2nd century A.D., talked about acroliths.

Marlovian theory

The Marlovian theory is an idea about who wrote Shakespeare's plays. The Marlovian theory says that Christopher Marlowe wrote most of those poems and plays. The theory also says Marlowe did not die in Deptford on 30 May 1593. It says his death was faked. Like William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe was an Elizabethan poet and playwright. They were both born in 1564.

Marlovian theory began in the 1800s. The idea is that the Church wanted to punish Marlowe for being an atheist, so Queen Elizabeth's government helped him fake his death, leave the country and continue writing plays by pretending those plays were Shakespeare's.

One piece of the puzzle is that the play "Lust's Dominion" was attributed to Marlowe when it was published in 1657. The play borrows from a pamphlet published in 1599, about the death of King Philip II of Spain in 1598. Marlowe died in 1593. The attribution has been recognized as spurious (wrong) by critics and scholars for nearly two centuries.

Online encyclopedia

An online encyclopedia, also called an internet encyclopedia, or a digital encyclopedia, is an encyclopedia accessible through the internet. Such as Wikipedia, which is an example of an encyclopedia, just online.

On 25 October 1993, Rick Gates created Interpedia to the PACS-L (Public-Access Computer Systems Forum) Listserv. That message included the following musings:

In January 1995, Project Gutenberg started to publish the ASCII text of the "Encyclopædia Britannica", 11th edition (1911), but disagreement about the method halted the work after the first volume. For trademark reasons this has been published as the "Gutenberg Encyclopedia". Project Gutenberg later restarted work on digitising and proofreading this encyclopedia. Project Gutenberg has published volumes in alphabetic order. The most recent publication is "Volume 17 Slice 8: Matter–Mecklenburg" published on 7 April 2013. The latest "Britannica" was digitized by its publishers, and sold first as a CD-ROM, and later as an online service.

In 2001, ASCII text of all 28 volumes was published on "Encyclopædia Britannica" Eleventh Edition by source; a copyright claim was added to the materials included. The website no longer exists.

Other digitization projects have made progress in other titles. One example is "Easton's Bible Dictionary (1897)" digitized by the Christian Classics Ethereal Library.

A successful digitization of an encyclopedia was the Bartleby Project's online adaptation of the "Columbia Encyclopedia", Sixth Edition, in early 2000 and is updated periodically.

Other websites provide online encyclopedias, some of which are also available on Wikisource, but which may be more complete than those on Wikisource, or maybe different editions (see List of online encyclopedias).

Gleðibankinn

"Gleðibankinn" (English translation: "Bank of Fun") is a song by ICY. Singers Eiríkur Hauksson, Helga Möller and Pálmi Gunnarsson were part of the band. It was the first Icelandic entry and the first song in Icelandic at the Eurovision Song Contest, being performed at Eurovision Song Contest 1986.

The music is positive. It talks about "the bank of fun", which is said to be where people's happiness is found, and not "your empty blues". And because happiness is stored in a bank, it can be taken out at any time when someone is feeling depressed.

Before the song was submitted, all three members performed the song. Only Pálmi Gunnarsson performed the song in the Icelandic finals.

It was the sixth song to be performed, after the United Kingdom's Ryder with "Runner In The Night" and before the Netherlands' Frizzle Sizzle with "Alles heeft ritme". When voting closed, it had 19 points, placing 16th out of 20 countries.

The next song performed for Iceland was Hægt og hljótt by Halla Margrét, which was performed at Eurovision Song Contest 1987.

Shunning

Shunning is the rejection of a person. It is usual in some religious groups to cut people off if they do not believe the beliefs or follow the rules of the group. It has been used in industrial action (strikes) and as a punishment in certain societies.


In many countries, religions get huge financial advantages by being recognised as religions. They are not taxed, or have much reduced taxes. In the United States, the Establishment Clause of the US Constitution prevents the US government and (through the Bill of Rights) the 50 state governments from imposing church taxes. In 1947, the US Supreme Court ruled that "No tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion." This explains why organisations such as Scientology wish to be classified as religions.

Schadenfreude

Schadenfreude comes from the German word by the same name. It literally translates to harm joy. It is the happiness that somebody gets when somebody else is hurt. Psychologists theorize that there are three causes for this emotion. Aggression, rivalry, or justice. Aggression-based schadenfreude happens because seeing someone else's group fail makes them feel better about themselves. Rivalry-based schadenfreude happens because seeing someone else fail makes them feel better about themselves. These may seem similar, but the difference is in that aggression is related to in-group and out-group identities, and rivalry is based on individuals. The last form is justice-based schadenfreude. This happens because people feel happy that someone bad is being punished. They feel good that the bad person is getting what they deserve.

Richard Lee McNair

Richard Lee McNair (born December 19, 1958) is an American criminal. He escaped from prison many times, but was taken back after he was spotted by a police officer in a very expensive van with homemade tinted windows.

In 1987, a month before his 30th birthday, McNair broke into and stole from a grain storage facility in Minot, North Dakota. He shot two men when stealing from another place that same year, and one of the men who McNair shot was killed. He was eventually arrested for the crimes, but when being questioned by police, he took lip balm out of his pocket and slipped his hands out of the cuffs the police had restrained him with during the arrest. He escaped the police station with the officers pursuing him from behind. McNair managed to hide inside a building when police officers came in to take him back to the police station. McNair jumped out of a window and crashed into a tree, but was injured when the branch he landed on snapped. After time in the hospital, McNair was housed at Ward County Jail in Minot, North Dakota. While serving time there, he broke through part of a wall in his cell, but police officers who worked there found out about it. After being moved to the North Dakota State Penitentiary, McNair and two other inmates escaped by crawling through the ventilation shaft. He went around the United States for ten months, but was arrested again and the officers marked him as a bad inmate, and moved him to the Oak Park Heights prison.

McNair eventually joined a sit down plea that led to him being moved to Florence High Security Prison in Minneapolis. After serving time, he joined another plea that led to him being moved to a high security prison in Denver. After serving time in there, he was moved to a high security federal prison in Louisiana. There, his job was to fix damaged mail bags so they could be sent back to the post office. On April 5, 2006, McNair decided to create an escape pod and hide inside one of the mail bags in a pallet. The pallet was later shrink wrapped but McNair managed to use a tube that he could breathe through once he had secretly pushed through the packaging. When police took the mail bag outside, McNair escaped the prison.

Later that same day, he was running near train tracks when a police officer saw him. McNair told the officer that he did not escape prison, and that he was doing exercise in the area. McNair told the officer that he and his brother were staying at a hotel when he was actually escaping from prison. In 2007 after over a year, he was stopped by police in Canada when they had seen him driving a stolen car. While being questioned by an officer, McNair escaped from them again. During his time protecting himself from capture, McNair had been making fake identification cards, and used computer technology to create driver’s licenses and monitor what the press was saying about him. He also appeared on Canada’s 15 Most Wanted list multiple times. In November that same year, a police officer noticed a van that seemed to have homemade tinted windows. McNair had made the tints himself, but the officer was suspicious because the van looked like it was a lot of money. The officer took the plate number and called it in. The day after, another officer spotted the van. A chase started, and when McNair drove the van into a parking lot, he ran off, but was stopped by the officer.

McNair now resides in ADX Florence, a supermax prison where inmates are locked down twenty-three hours a day, and they leave their cells with police by their side, who make sure they cannot escape the prison.

Horseshoe Theory

Horseshoe Theory is an idea in political science. It asserts that the far-right is more similar to the far-left than to the center-right and vice versa. Horseshoe Theory is often used as argument for centrism.

The name Horseshoe Theory comes from the idea that politics is not a straight line from left to right but bent like a horseshoe so that the two ends (the far-left and the far-right) share more similarities with each other than their moderate counterparts.

Philosopher Jean-Pierre Faye invented Horseshoe Theory after observation of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union's joint invasion of Poland which started World War II.

Common criticism of Horseshoe Theory have often stated that politics are more complex than a simple scale between left and right, and many ideas the far-left follows are not followed by the far-right. Because of this, many experts, like Simon Choat, have said that Horseshoe Theory is false.

On 1 February 2021, there was a coup d'état in Myanmar. Important leaders including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint were detained as the military (Tatmadaw) took control of the government.

Myanmar (also known as Burma) has been under military rule before. General Ne Win led a coup in 1962.

The military killed many protestors.(3000-10000 as estimated).

Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of General Aung San, who helped free Burma from British rule. After 1988, she became a pro-democracy activist. In 1990, her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), won the elections in a landslide. However, the government refused to say that her party won.

In 2011, Suu Kyi's party won the elections. However, she is not allowed to be president of the country because her family (her late husband Michael Aris and two sons) are British citizens. So she became State Counsellor, which is like a prime minister.

In 2020, there was an election in Myanmar. The NLD won the election but Tatmadaw accused that there was an election fraud and made a coup at the early morning of February 1st of 2021. However, the proof that there was a fraud is not found, so far and people believes that Tatmadaw made the coup because the generals wants to restart the military dictatorship which ended about 10 years ago. After coup, people protests began in the whole country with many people because they wanted their elected government back but Tatmadaw disagree and killed many protesting people (around 1000 estimated), which led the People Defensive War, the national wide armed resistance against the military regime,

Early in the morning of 1 February, Suu Kyi and other leaders in her party were taken away in a raid. Then the Internet and phone lines were cut off so that people could not talk to others inside or outside the countries.

After the occupation ended, nationalist groups in Japan tried to convince the government to bring back the holiday. After a few years, they did. They called it National Foundation Day instead of National Empire Day and removed most of the imperial imagery.

Fine-tuned universe

A universe that is fine-tuned is a universe that is designed well-enough to support life. Life as we know it would be impossible if certain things in physics were slightly different. Our universe is fine-tuned for life, and this is seen as not likely. This is because many things have to come together in a certain way. One explanation for this is the anthropic principle. This means that the universe supports life because we wouldn't be here to wonder that if it didn't. This usage of the anthropic principle is tautological. This means that it is true because it is true.

Another explanation for this is the teleological argument. It is also known as argument from design. This means that an intelligent creator created the universe. It is still unknown if the universe created itself or if it was created by someone or something else.

Martin Rees had six of these examples. Some of these are:


Nine Inch Nails live performances

The rock band Nine Inch Nails started doing tours when it was first made in 1988. Trent Reznor started the band and does most of the work for the band's studio. The band has played in many festivals. For example, they played at Woodstock '94, Lollapalooza in 1991 and 2008, and the MTV Video Music Awards. Before 2013, they did 938 gigs.

Nine Inch Nails does not play the same in concerts than when they do in studios. Reznor makes and plays most of the band's music. Other people might sing or play instruments if it is needed for the song. Reznor makes groups of backing musicians (people who play for concerts). Alessandro Cortini (one of the band's keyboardists) said that how the band plays in studios and in CDs is different from how they play in concerts.

Before 2016, Reznor was the only member of the band. Nine Inch Nails' concerts have lighting effects used for the stage. The effects have been done by Reznor and Rob Sheridan starting in 1999. Three tours have been talked about in albums and documentaries.

Critics have said that the tours are good. Some critics talk about how the stage feels aggressive. They also liked the effects that the stage uses. In 2008, Reznor wanted the band to stop touring after 2009. They started touring again in 2013.

Shakti

Shakti (Devanagari: शक्ति, IAST: Śakti; lit. "Energy, ability, strength, effort, power, capability") is the primordial cosmic energy and represents the dynamic forces that are thought to move through the entire universe in Hinduism, and especially Shaktism, a major tradition of Hinduism. Shakti is the personification of the energy that is creative, sustaining, as well as destructive, sometimes referred to as auspicious source energy.

As the Shakti or Creatrix, She is known as Adi Parashakti or "Adi Param Shakti" or simply "Adi Shakti" (i.e., Primordial Inconceivable Energy). On every plane of creation, energy manifests itself in all forms of matter, thermal energy, potential energy, gravitational energy etc. These are all thought to be infinite forms of the Para Shakti. But Her true form is unknown, and beyond human understanding. She is "Anaadi" (with no beginning, no ending) and "Nitya" (forever).

In Shaktism, Adi Parashakti is worshipped as the Supreme Being.

Found in a Paleolithic context in the Son River valley and dating to 9,000–8,000 BCE, the Baghor stone, says Jonathan Mark Kenoyer, is highly probable that the stone is associated with Shakti. The worshipping of Shiv and Shakti was also prevalent in Indus valley civilization.

The Shakti goddess is also known as "Amma" in south India, especially in the states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh. There are many temples devoted to various incarnations of the Shakti goddess in most of the villages in South India. The rural people believe that Shakti is the protector of the village, the punisher of evil people, the cure of diseases, and the one who gives welfare to the village. They celebrate Shakti Jataras with great interest once a year. Some examples of Shakti names are Mahalakshmi, Kamakshi, Parvati, Lalita, Bhuvaneshwari, Durga, Meenakshi, Mariamman, Yellamma, Poleramma, and Perantalamma.

Sri Guru Amritananda Nath Saraswati, performing the Navavarana Puja, an important ritual in Srividya Tantric Shaktism, at the Sahasrakshi Meru Temple at Devipuram, Andhra Pradesh, India.

Shaktism regards Devi (lit., "the Goddess") as the Supreme Brahman itself with all other forms of divinity considered to be merely Her diverse manifestations. In the details of its philosophy and practice, Shaktism resembles Shaivism. However, "Shaktas" (Sanskrit: शक्त, "Śakta", ), practitioners of Shaktism, focus most or all worship on Shakti, as the dynamic feminine aspect of the Supreme Divine. Shiva, the masculine aspect of divinity, is considered solely transcendent, and Shiva's worship is usually secondary.

According to some schools, there are four Adi Shakti Pitha and 51 Shakti centers of worship located in South Asia (four Adi Shakti Pitha are also part of 51 Shakti pithas but they are four major parts of Devi Sati's body. So, they are adi shakti pithas). They can be found in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Tibet and Pakistan. These are called Shakti Peethas. The list of locations varies. A commonly accepted list of Shakti Peethas and their temple complexes includes:


Other pithas in Maharashtra are:


There are many ancient Shakti devotional songs and vibrational chants in the Hindu and Sikh traditions (found in Sarbloh Granth). The recitation of the Sanskrit mantras is commonly used to call upon the Divine Mother.



"Merge in the Maha Shakti. This is enough to take away your misfortune. This will carve out of you a woman. Woman needs her own Shakti, not anybody else will do it ... When a woman chants the Kundalini Bhakti mantra, God clears the way. This is not a religion, it is a reality. Woman is not born to suffer, and woman needs her own power."

The show's chief creator and main writer was Spike Milligan. 
The show was acted by Peter Sellers, Harry Secombe and Milligan. Michael Bentine was also a member until 1953. 

Each of the actors played several stock characters, a regular pattern in radio and theatrical comedy. By "stock characters" is meant characters whose idiosyncracies (peculiaririties) is well understood by the listening audience. This was also a feature of much music hall entertainment.

The scripts mixed ludicrous plots with surreal humour, puns, catchphrases and an array of bizarre sound effects. Some of the later episodes had electronic effects devised by the fledgling BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Many of these ideas were reused by other shows for decades. Elements of the show satirised life in Britain, parodying aspects of show business, commerce, industry, art, politics, diplomacy, the police, the military, education, class structure, literature and films.

The show was preceded by Ted Ray's "Ray's a Laugh" as the key comedy programme on BBC radio.

The "Goon Show" had an influence on the later BBC television series "Monty Python". Both were absurdist comedies.

Stock character

A stock character is a stereotype fictional character. In a theatre, novel, play or film, the audience immediately knows about him or her without further explanation. All types of fiction use this device, especially comedy.
They have been used in all forms of theatre, right back to the Ancient Greek theatre. The Star Wars movie franchise offers many examples. They are archetypal characters, simplified and "flat". As a result, they may be easy targets for parody, and criticized as clichés. Stock characters help to identify a genre or subgenre. For example, a fairy tale or fantasy is likely to have a knight-errant as hero and a witch as opposition.

One stock character often used is the low-class character(s) who warn the hero of danger to come. Examples:

It seems their function is to introduce the idea of fatalism, the idea that we are not masters of our fate. Human fame and glory is temporary. Even Achilles has his weakness.

As the hero falls, he is usually allowed a final comment. Caesar's was "Et tu, Brute?" meaning "Not you as well, Brutus?" That's known as a valediction (means a farewell comment). Shakespeare has many examples: Another famous example is Richard III's last cry of "A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!"

3 Idiots

3 Idiots (stylized as 3 idiots) is a 2009 Indian Hindi-language coming-of-age comedy drama buddy film written, edited and directed by Rajkumar Hirani, co-written by Abhijat Joshi, produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra under the production banner of Vinod Chopra Films and distributed by Reliance BIG Pictures. Released in India on 25 December 2009, adapted loosely from Chetan Bhagat's 2004 novel "Five Point Someone: What NOT to do at IIT!" and considered to be a cult film in the Hindi cinema, the film stars Aamir Khan, R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi in the titular roles, marking their reunion three years after "Rang De Basanti" (2006), while Kareena Kapoor, Boman Irani, Omi Vaidya, Mona Singh, Javed Jaffrey, Parikshit Sahni and Amardeep Jha appear in pivotal roles. Narrated through two parallel dramas, one in the present and the other set ten years in the past, the story follows the friendship of three students at an Indian engineering college and is a satire about the social pressures under the Indian education system.
Two friends embark on a quest for a lost buddy. On this journey, they encounter a long-forgotten bet, a wedding they must crash, and a funeral that goes, ridiculously out of control. As they make their way through the perilous landscape, another journey begins. Their inner journey through memory lane and the story of their friend - the impressible free-thinker Rancho, who in a unique way, had touched and changed their lives. It is a story of their hostel days that swings between Rancho's romance with the spirited Pia, and his clash with an oppressive mentor, Viru Sahastrabuddhe. And then one day, suddenly, Rancho vanished. Who was he? Where did he come from? Why did he leave? The friend who influenced and inspired them to think creatively and independently, even as the conformist world called them "three idiots". Where is the original idiot now? Finally, in misty mountains with unparalleled beauty, the friends find the key to the secret.

The film begins with a wildlife photographer, Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), boarding an airplane from Delhi when he receives a phone call from Chatur Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya), his biggest rival from college, who claims to be knowing the whereabouts of his long-lost college friend, Ranchhoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), also known as Rancho. Shocked at learning this, Farhan immediately fakes a heart attack to create an emergency landing of his flight and is rushed back to the airport in a wheelchair. Farhan later manages to escape from the airport in a taxi and meets with another college friend, Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi). Subsequently, the duo races to their former college campus, the Imperial College of Engineering (ICE), and meets up with Chatur, who reminds them both of the bet he had made with Rancho ten years ago, about who would end up more successful in the next ten years, and boasts to them both about him being the prosperous vice president of a reputable company in the United States. Frustrated, Farhan and Raju berate Chatur for wasting their time when Chatur reveals that he has located Rancho's home in Shimla and the three of them begin their journey from Delhi in search of Rancho.

Over a flashback ten years prior, it is shown that Farhan joined the prestigious ICE in his first year of college, since his father (Parikshit Sahni) forced him to pursue engineering despite his passion for wildlife photography, and immediately befriended his hostel roommate, the god-fearing Raju, who comes from an impoverished family and is afraid of both failure and job. While being ragged by the senior students, Farhan and Raju befriend their third roommate, the carefree Rancho, who comes from a wealthy family and is passionate about experimenting with different scientific theories. Rancho's easygoing approach to education always results in him being at odds with the director of the ICE, Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), who believes in a strict and competitive education system and is nicknamed "Virus" by the ICE students. When a senior student named Joy Lobo (Ali Fazal) is denied graduation by Virus on grounds of failure to follow his project deadline, Rancho recreates Joy's project of a drone camera with the help of Farhan and Raju in an attempt to cheer him up. Unfortunately, Joy commits suicide by hanging in his room before he can see the drone camera come to life, provoking Rancho to confront Virus about the extreme pressure placed on the ICE students but is rudely rebuffed. One night, the hungry trio gatecrashes a marriage ceremony to enjoy the dinner and befriends Virus' younger daughter, Pia (Kareena Kapoor), only to later realise that the marriage is for Pia's older sister, Mona (Mona Singh). Although initially upset by Rancho's behaviour, Pia falls in love with him after Rancho pranks her shallow, materialistic boyfriend, Suhas Tandon (Sanjay Lafont), in an attempt to demonstrate his obsession about money and status. As a result, Pia breaks up with Suhas after he rebukes her for wearing an antique watch which belonged to her late mother.

Meanwhile, Virus warns Farhan and Raju about the effects of them being friends with Rancho by pointing out the modest financial situations of their families, provoking Raju to move in with Chatur, a Tamil, Uganda-born, arrogant, competitive student who believes in learning by rote memorization but is not fluent in Hindi. Chatur is nicknamed "Silencer" by the ICE students as he consumes some memory-enhancing pills with the side-effect of silent but lethal flatulence. In an attempt to teach Chatur a lesson about memorization, Rancho and Farhan make obscene modifications, like "chamatkar" ("miracle") to "balatkar" ("rape") and "dhan" ("wealth") to "stan" ("bosoms"), to the script of Chatur's Teachers' Day speech. After a disastrous speech in front of Virus, the Minister of Education and the ICE professors, a humiliated and furious Chatur drunkenly challenges Rancho to meet with him after ten years and see who is more successful. On the night before their final examinations, Raju's paralyzed father suffers from a medical emergency, but Rancho enlists Pia's help and rushes Raju's father to the hospital on time via Pia's scooter. After learning from Pia and the doctor how the timely intervention saved his father's life, Raju realises his mistake and reconciles with Rancho and Farhan. At the end of their first year in the ICE, Rancho comes first in the class, while Farhan and Raju are last and second to last, respectively. During the yearly class photograph, Rancho makes a bet with Virus that if either Raju or Farhan gets a job from the on-campus interviews, Virus will shave off his moustache.

Back in the present, Farhan, Raju and Chatur arrive in Shimla to meet Rancho, but are extremely shocked to come across a completely different man (Javed Jaffrey) identifying himself as "Ranchhoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad", whose face is pasted over that of Rancho in their first year class photograph with an ICE degree of Rancho's name. When Farhan and Raju ask Chatur how he got Rancho's address, he reveals that he managed to do so when his secretary had come to Shimla to make a business deal with "Phunsukh Wangdu", a sensational scientist and inventor with 400 patents to credit. On learning this, Farhan and Raju confront the so-called "Ranchhoddas", who is initially reluctant to reveal anything and threatens the duo with a gun, but when Farhan and Raju turn the tables on hook threaten to flush his late father's ashes down the toilet, he explains that he is the real Ranchhoddas and the "Rancho" at the ICE was his family's gardener's son, who was incredibly intelligent and gifted and was adopted by the Chanchad family after being orphaned. While Ranchhoddas himself went to London for four years, his father (Arun Bali) paid for Rancho to attend the ICE on his son's name on condition that he cut off all contact with everyone there after graduating. Rancho, who was more interested in learning than in getting a degree, agreed but warned Ranchhoddas afterwards that "two idiots" would come searching for him one day. Ranchhoddas tells Farhan and Raju that he is grateful for what all Rancho did and provides them with his real address in Ladakh, where Rancho is promptly leading a simple life as a schoolteacher, and Farhan, Raju and Chatur begin their journey once again from Shimla in search of Rancho.

Back in the past, the trio is shown to be approaching graduation in their fourth year at the ICE. One night, Rancho points out to Farhan and Raju why they consistently place last; Farhan's passion is wildlife photography, not engineering, and Raju lacks self-confidence. When Farhan and Raju promise to confront their problems if Rancho confesses his feelings for Pia, the trio breaks into Virus' home in and Farhan and Raju urinate on his letterbox in a drunken state. During the trio's escape, however, Virus spots Raju and gives him an ultimatum the next day to either act as his witness in rusticating Rancho or being rusticated from the ICE himself. Neither wishing to disappoint his family nor betray his friend, a distraught Raju attempts suicide by jumping from heights and passes into a coma, but successfully recovers over the next few months with the support and care of Rancho, Farhan and Pia, while Virus also rescinds his rustication. With a newfound perspective of his life, Raju confidently attends his on-campus interview and manages to secure a job in an engineering firm, while Farhan also convinces his father about his passion for wildlife photography and contentment with the job he secured with his role model, wildlife photographer Andre Istvan, in Hungary. According to the bet made by Rancho, Virus' private barber shaves off his moustache and in an attempt to protect his fragile ego, Virus drunkenly decides to sabotage Raju's chances of success by setting an unfairly difficult examination. However, Pia visits Rancho in a drunken state and provides him with the duplicate keys of Virus' office, encouraging him to copy the examination papers set by Virus for Raju.

The story forwards to the journey where Farhan and Raju suddenly remember Pia and decide to take her along with them to Rancho. As Chatur protests against the detour, stating that it would jeapordize his meeting with Phunsukh Wangdu, the duo ties him up inside the car trunk and gatecrashes Pia's marriage ceremony with Suhas in Manali. Farhan sneaks in to reunite with Pia while Raju disguises himself as a housekeeper for Suhas. Pia initially refuses to go with Farhan, despite hearing Suhas screaming at Raju for ruining his expensive marriage suit, leading Farhan to realise that their plan has worked. Raju escapes in the heat of the moment with the marriage suit, assuring Suhas that he will return it in mint condition, but instead proceeds to fill in as the bridegroom. As Pia finds this out, she grows concerned over public reaction to the ruse, causing Raju to reveal himself and confront Pia over her love for Rancho, even as Suhas arrives in a gown. As she spots Farhan at the entrance, with the car door opened, Pia breaks free from the bond and escapes with Farhan, Raju and Chatur in front of the shocked Suhas, Virus, Mona and all the marriage guests to go to Ladakh and meet Rancho.

The story rewinds to their final year at the ICE where Rancho and Farhan use the duplicate keys provided by Pia to break into Virus' office and are successful in copying the examination papers for Raju. Despite Raju refusing to use the examination papers, Virus discovers what happened and angrily has the trio rusticated from the ICE in the middle of the night, causing Pia to admit her role in the events and confront Virus over her brother's suicidal demise, which was misinterpreted by Virus as an accident, simply because his passion for literature and desire to become a writer was overruled by Virus, who was insistent on his son becoming an engineer. As the trio is leaving the campus in the middle of heavy rainstorms, they come across the now-pregnant Mona, who goes under labor pain moments after a distressed Pia has walked out of the house, and is unable to be driven to the hospital. Applying their knowledge of engineering, the trio brings Mona inside the table tennis room in the campus and successfully conducts her delivery, by modifying a vacuum cleaner into a makeshift venthouse, with the help of Pia (who is still in self-isolation) from the hospital through a video call and other students. Realising the fault in his ways and how genius Rancho is, a grateful Virus acknowledges him by handing him over a valuable space pen, which he promised to give only to his most extraordinary student, and rescinds the trio's rustications once again. Rancho, along with Farhan and Raju, tops the university in the final year, but abruptly leaves the graduation ceremony in a taxi without informing anyone and has never been heard of again.

Over the end of the flashback, Farhan, Raju, Pia and Chatur reach Ladakh and at the address provided by Ranchhoddas, they are astonished to find a thriving school that is probably run by Rancho. The group also meets Manmohan, formerly an errand boy at the ICE nicknamed "Millimeter" by the students, and now Rancho's personal assistant in Ladakh, who reveals that Rancho has keenly followed Farhan and Raju's careers. Finally, Farhan, Raju, Pia and Chatur have an emotional reunion with Rancho on a sandbar where Rancho admits that he is still in love with Pia and the two of them share a passionate kiss. Chatur condescendingly insults Rancho's apparent status as a schoolteacher and declares that he has won the bet. He proceeds to make Rancho sign the document of "Declaration of Defeat" and even states that he deserves Virus' space pen. As Chatur walks away in supposed victory, Farhan, Raju and Pia ask for Rancho's real name and he reveals himself, in a plot twist, to be Phunsukh Wangdu, the successful entrepreneur, whom Chatur's company is courting. Following this revelation, Rancho contacts Chatur, who is a few distance away from the group, and considers calling off the deal. A flabbergasted Chatur accepts defeat and Rancho, Farhan, Raju and Pia run away laughing. The film ends with a humiliated Chatur chasing after Rancho, Farhan, Raju and Pia and Farhan quoting Rancho's words on success; "Pursue excellence, and success will follow, pants down".

When asked about plans of a "3 Idiots" sequel in an interview with "Hindustan Times", screenwriter Abhijat Joshi replied, saying, "Honestly, I don't know. We have an idea for the 3 Idiots sequel, a "Munna Bhai" part three, and also for a "PK" sequel; but the "PK" and "Munna Bhai" sequels interest me the most. So, I think the "3 Idiots" sequel may happen in the future, but these two I really want to work on." In January 2016, director Rajkumar Hirani and actor Aamir Khan confirmed that they were considering a "3 Idiots" sequel. Khan told reporters, ""Raju Hirani has given me a hint about "3 Idiots" sequel and I am giving you all a hint. The film will happen if and whenever he will write the script." Hirani agreed, saying "this is one film that I really want to do."

In June 2018, Hirani was asked a question while promoting his upcoming film "Sanju" and he was quoted as saying, "I definitely want to make a sequel to "3 Idiots", but it’s still in the initial stage and we will take a fair amount of time to develop the script". The report also said that Hirani will begin shooting for the "Munna Bhai" sequel with Sanjay Dutt. Work on "3 Idiots" will begin only after Hirani is done with "Munna Bhai 3".

Obscene phone call

An obscene phone call is when someone uses bad, sexual or hateful language while talking to another person on a telephone.

In many U.S. states, making an obscene telephone call is a Class 1 Misdemeanor.

The victims of substandard or obscene telephone calls should hang up on the callers and report the incidents to their telephone company or local police.

Even if/when Caller IDs aren't shown, calls are logged by the telephone company. This is so the obscene caller's number can be discovered. But many obscene phone callers use payphones or mobile phones instead of regular landline phones.

Obscene phone callers are often male. However, there are many female obscene phone callers.

Some obscene phone callers have trouble forming relationships, so making obscene telephone calls is the only way they express themselves.

The usual age for making such telephone calls is the teenage years, particularly ages 12 to 16. The average age is 14.

Caller ID

Caller identification (Caller ID) is a telephone service. It is available in analog and digital telephone systems. That includes voice over IP (voIP). 

The information received from the service is shown on a telephone display screen.

In early 1995, Bellcore released another type of modulation, similar to Bell 202. It became possible to send caller ID information while a user was already on the telephone. This service became call waiting ID.

Smartphones use third-party mobile apps to do name look ups.

Samudragupta

Samudragupta (Gupta script: "Sa-mu-dra-gu-pta", r. c. (350-375 CE) was a ruler of the Gupta Empire of Ancient India. He was a son of the emperor Chandragupta I and the Licchavi princess Kumaradevi. He greatly expanded his dynasty's political power.

The Allahabad Pillar inscription, a "prashasti" (eulogy) was written by his courtier Harishena. It told of his many military conquests. It suggests that he defeated several kings of northern India. Also, that he added their territories to his empire. He also marched along the south-eastern coast of India. He advanced to move as far as the Pallava kingdom. In addition, he subjugated several frontier kingdoms and tribal oligarchies.

Samudragupta performed the Ashvamedha sacrifice to prove his imperial sovereignty. According to his coins, he remained undefeated. His gold coins and inscriptions suggest that he was an accomplished poet. He also played music. His expansionist policy was continued by his son Chandragupta II.
The primary source for the military campaigns of Samudragupta is the Allahabad Pillar Inscription, which was inscribed during his reign and provides a general overview of his military conquests. Other historical sources, such as the Puranas and the works of Chinese and Greek historians, also provide some information about Samudragupta's reign, but do not provide a comprehensive list of all his military campaigns.

Often these are considered as battles where samudragupta was never defeated however there may be battles excluding these where he may have lost and we don't know the Source for this yet.

Samudragupta's empire included a core territory in northern India. It was directly controlled by the emperor. Besides, it included some monarchical and tribal tributary states. Historian R. C. Majumdar theorizes that Samudragupta directly controlled an area extending from the Ravi River (Punjab) in the west to the Brahmaputra River (Bengal and Assam) in the east, and from the Himalayan foothills in the north to the Vindhya hills in the south. The south-western boundary of his territory roughly followed a line drawn from present-day Karnal to Bhilsa.

In the south, Samudragupta's empire definitely included Eran in present-day Madhya Pradesh. On there, his inscription has been found. The Allahabad Pillar inscription suggests that he reached early up to Kanchipuram in the south. However, since the claims in the Allahabad Pillar inscription are from a royal eulogy, they must be treated with danger.

Samudragupta's coins show him as a tall, strong man. The Allahabad Pillar inscription presents him as a compassionate ruler. It was stated that his "mind was engaged in providing relief to the low, the poor, the helpless, and the afflicted". It also stated that he reinstated many royal families which had lost their kingdoms, including the kings defeated by him. At the same time, it states that he maintained strict administration ("Prachanda shasana").

The inscription states that Samudragupta became famous among the learned people because of his poetical works. He earned the epithet "king of poets". This suggests that he composed some poetical works. But none of these works now survive.

The inscription also says that Samudragupta embarrassed the celestial musician Tumburu and Narada by his lovely performances of music. Samudragupta's musical talents are also corroborated by his gold coins which depict him playing a veena. 

The inscription praises Samudragupta's wisdom and intellect. It was stated that he was smarter than the preceptor of the Lord of the Gods (that is, Brihaspati).

Grand Union Canal (old)

The Grand Union Canal was a canal in England from Foxton, Leicestershire on the Leicestershire and Northamptonshire Union Canal to Norton Junction, close to Long Buckby Wharf on the Grand Junction Canal. 

It now forms the first of the Leicester Section, a branch of the much bigger modern Grand Union Canal.

The creation of the canal system in central England was hugely important to the industrial revolution. It allowed the raw materials and the products to be moved cheaply. Many factories back onto rivers or canals all over industrial England. Moving heavy loads is cheapest and best done on water.

Acasta Gneiss

The Acasta Gneiss is the oldest rock in the world. It is in the Slave craton in Northwest Territories, Canada. 

The rock body is exposed on an island about 300 kilometres north of Yellowknife. The rock of the outcrop was metamorphosed 3.58 to 4.031 billion (10) years ago. It is the oldest known intact crustal fragment on Earth.

The nearby Acasta River east of Great Bear Lake gave the rock its name. It is the oldest known exposed rock in the world.

The rock, before it was metamorphized, was a granitoid that formed 4.03 billion years ago. This age is based on radiometric dating of zircon crystals at 4.031x10 years. The Acasta Gneiss is important in establishing the early history of the continental crust.

Origin of water on Earth

The origin of water on Earth is only barely known. All life on Earth needs water, and most types of life started in the sea. Earth is the only planet known with liquid water on its surface. The water on Earth may have come from the Solar System as it formed, or it may have formed on Earth. Both are possible. We do know that hydrogen and oxygen, the elements that constitute water come from stars. Oxygen is created through fusion of helium and carbon atoms inside the core of red giants.

Earth is in the habitable zone, it is not so far from the Sun that all water freezes, and not so close to the Sun that all water evaporates. This is why liquid water, important for all life, still exists on the surface of Earth. 

A long time ago, scientists thought that water on Earth did not come from the planet’s region of the protoplanetary disk. Instead, it was thought water must have been delivered to Earth from the outer Solar System later in its history. However, recent research suggests that hydrogen inside the Earth played a role in the formation of the ocean. The two ideas are not mutually exclusive: there is evidence water was delivered to Earth by impacts from icy planetesimals similar in composition to asteroids in the outer edges of the asteroid belt.

One problem that hasn't been solved is that the noble gas isotope ratios of Earth's atmosphere are different than those of its mantle. This might mean they were created from different sources.

Untriseptium

Untriseptium (), also called eka-dubnium or element 137, is a possible chemical element which has not been synthesized. Due to instabilities, it is not known if this element is possible, as the instabilities may hint that the periodic table ends soon after the island of stability at unbihexium. Its atomic number is 137 and symbol is Uts.

The name "untriseptium" is a temporary name.

It is sometimes called feynmanium (symbol Fy) because Richard Feynman noted that a simplistic interpretation of the relativistic Dirac equation runs into problems with electron orbitals at "Z" > 1/α = 137, suggesting that neutral atoms cannot exist beyond untriseptium, and that a periodic table of elements based on electron orbitals breaks down at this point. However, a more thorough analysis calculates the limit to be around element 173.

Although precious metal bullion is no longer used to make coins for general circulation, it continues to be held as an investment with a reputation for stability in periods of economic uncertainty.

Unlike numismatic coins, a bullion coin is a coin, new or old, that is bought only for the price of the metal it is made of, not for its condition, age or any other value, british gold sovereigns are a common historic bullion coin, and most countries produce a coin meant solely for bullion purposes in different weights, e.g american silver eagle.

Bullion can also be in the form of bars of precious metal in different weights (and thus sizes) bars can easily be stacked and are easier to sort then coins as only the weight needs to be taken into consideration.

It may also be jewellery such as neck chains, pocket watch cases and pendants.

Typical bullion metals include:

Due to it's relatively small size and high value, bullion is often stolen in robberies and burglaries, as a result it is mainly stored in safes, some people who invest in bullion may choose to pay to have it stored in a safe deposit box at a local bank, rather then a safe in their own home.

"Stacking" is an informal term for the act of collecting bullion.

Low value bullion is sometimes carried in a pocket or worn as jewellery.

It opened on Broadway in December 2016 at the Music Box Theatre. It won six awards at the 71st Tony Awards. Two of them were the Best Musical and Best Score awards.

The main character is Evan Hansen. He is a senior in high school with social anxiety. He also has a broken arm. He writes a letter to himself, which is what his therapist told him to do. It's the first day of school. His mom, Heidi, says that he should ask people at school to sign his cast. There is another family on the stage: the Murphys. Cynthia and Larry and their kids, Connor and Zoe are eating breakfast. Cynthia thinks her family is falling apart. Heidi wants to know how to connect with her son ("Anybody Have A Map?").

At school, Evan meets with Alana and Jared. They don't sign his cast. Evan then sees Connor. Connor pushes Evan to the ground. He thinks Evan is making fun of him. Connor's sister, Zoe, comes to Evan. She is sorry for her brother's actions. Evan has a crush on Zoe. He does not say what he wants to say to Zoe. He is too awkward. He feels like he is alone. ("Waving Through a Window")

Evan writes another letter to himself. He talks about Zoe. He says that she makes him happy. He says that his hope is in her. ("Waving Through a Window (Reprise #1)"). He runs into Connor again. Connor signs Evan's cast. Connor sees Evan's letter. He sees Zoe's name. He thinks that Evan is making fun of him again. Connor angrily leaves with the letter. Evan tells Jared what happened. ("Waving Through a Window (Reprise #2)").

A few days pass. Evan is called into the principal's office. He sees Cynthia and Larry Murphy. They tell him that Connor has killed himself. They found Evan's letter in Connor's pocket. They think that it is Connor's suicide letter to Evan. They see his name on Evan's cast. They think Connor and Evan were friends. Evan is nervous and uncomfortable. He doesn't tell the Murphys that they are wrong.

Evan goes to the Murphy's house for dinner. He is doesn't know what to say. He lies to make the Murphys happy. He tells them that he and Connor were best friends. He says they used to email each other. He makes up a story about how he broke his arm. He says that Connor was with him at an abandoned apple orchard (the Murphys used to go to this orchard). He says he broke his arm by falling from a tree ("For Forever").

Jared helps Evan make fake email conversations. Evan uses them show his and Connor's friendship ("Sincerely, Me"). Evan shows the emails to the Murphys. Cynthia is happy that her son had a close friend. Larry is hurt that Connor didn't appreciate his family. Zoe doesn't want to cry for her brother ("Requiem"). She asks Evan why she was mentioned in Evan's letter (she thinks Connor wrote it). Evan tells Zoe his own reason why he loves her. He makes her think that they were Connor's reasons ("If I Could Tell Her").

Evan, Alana, and Jared found "The Connor Project". Its purpose is to remember Connor. The Murphys support the idea ("Disappear"). Evan gives an inspirational speech during the start of The Connor Project. It goes viral. Zoe thanks Evan for what he did ("You Will Be Found").

Alana and Evan want to raise $50,000 to reopen the apple orchard. Evan is spending more time with Zoe and her family. He neglects his own family, Jared, and The Connor Project ("Sincerely, Me (Reprise)"). Larry tells Evan about his relationship with Connor. He gives Evan a new baseball glove ("To Break In A Glove"). Zoe tells Evan that she wants their relationship to be only about them. She doesn't want it to be about Connor ("Only Us").

Heidi finds out about the lies Evan made. Evan fights with her. He tells her that he likes being with the Murphy family. He says that Heidi is never there for him, but the Murphys are. Alana finds that some things in the fake emails (which she thinks are real) don't match up. Jared threatens to tell people about Evan's lies ("Good For You"). Evan decides that he needs to tell the Murphys the truth. He thinks about all that he will lose ("For Forever (Reprise)").

Evan shows Alana his letter. She thinks that it is Connor's suicide note. Alan posts it online. People start blaming the Murphys for Connor's suicide ("You Will Be Found (Reprise)"). Evan tells the Murphys the truth about the lies he made. He deals with the consequences ("Words Fail"). His mother sees the letter. She knows that it was Evan's letter. Evan admits that his fall from the tree was a suicide attempt. Heidi is sorry for not seeing that Evan was hurting. She promises that she will always be there when he needs her ("So Big, So Small").

2020–21 United States election protests

The 2020–21 United States election protests were a series of protests across the United States after the 2020 United States presidential election between then-President Donald Trump and former vice president Joe Biden. The election was held on November 3, 2020. Biden won the election with 306 votes in the Electoral College to Donald Trump's 232. 

Before the election Donald Trump claimed without any evidence that there was election fraud. He refused to give up and him and his allies attempted to overturn the results of the election. Trump filed dozens of legal challenges to the results, which were rejected by at least 86 judges, some that Trump even hired. The courts found that his claims had no evidence to prove that there was fraud.

Pro-Trump protesters, including groups such as the Proud Boys, took part in many protests in Washington, D.C., state capitals, and other locations across the nation to show that they did not agree with the election results and shout Trump's claims of election fraud.

On January 6—the day when the U.S. Congress counts the electoral votes—Trump supporters got together for the "Save America" rally where people heard speeches from Trump and Rudy Giuliani. Before the speeches were over, a large mob of protesters marched on to Congress and stormed the building. Congress was in session at the time, certifying the Electoral College vote count. Several buildings in the U.S. Capitol complex were evacuated, and protesters broke past security to enter the U.S. Capitol building, including National Statuary Hall.

After the storming of the U.S. Capitol, at least 36 House Democrats called for Trump's immediate impeachment and removal by Congress.

Armed supporters of Trump have continued protesting after of the storming of the US Capitol. As of January 10, armed protests were being planned at the state capitals of most states. Thousands of soldiers were sent to protect the capital, and by the inauguration ceremony for Biden, up to 25,000 soldiers were sent to guard against anymore threats to security. Protests have continued in some U.S. cities after Biden became president.

Protest in support of Donald Trump started on November 4.







On January 6, the protesters planned to march to the United States Capitol. A crowd of thousands of Trump supporters first listened to a speech by Trump. He told them again the election had been stolen and said, "We will never give up. We will never concede. ... Our country has had enough. We're not going to take it anymore." He urged them to march on the Capitol and "show strength". Many people then marched on the Capitol, where they got past the police, broke windows, and stormed inside the Capitol building. They marched through Statuary Hall. Rioters took over the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's office, flipping tables and ripping photos from walls; there was looting in the Capitol. Many police officers were injured in the violence at the Capitol. One died of his injuries, and another committed suicide over the following weekend. A woman was shot inside the Capitol and later died; no information has been told about the shooter. At least one improvised explosive device was found on Capitol, and another was close by at the headquarters of the Republican Party.


The FBI reported that protests were being planned at all United States state capitols and in Washington, D.C., and that they are likely to take place from January 16 to 20.

Rochechouart crater

The Rochechouart crater is a place in France where a meteorite, a rock from outer space, hit the surface of the Earth, leaving a crater. The meteorite hit came during the Jurassic or Triassic period. Rochechouart is between the Haute-Vienne and the Charente.

The last four estimates (since 2010) are converging toward an age between 203 and 207 million years, in the Rhaetian, two to five million years older than the TriassicJurassic boundary.

Some scientists think that the Rochechouart crater is part of a group of five craters that happened at about the same time. They think a large meteor or comet broke into pieces and many of the pieces hit the Earth.

Tobacco smoking

Tobacco smoking or cigarette smoking is when a person breathes in and breathes out smoke from a cigarette using a lighter. Smoking is harmful to the lungs, and can cause many diseases such as cancer, pneumonia, and many others. When a user smokes, the chemicals from inside the cigarette damage the body, including the smoke, making the person more likely to get certain diseases.

In public areas such as arenas or police stations, smoking is usually not allowed. This is because the smoke from the cigarette goes into the air, and can be breathed in by other people. Signs have to be placed in public areas to stop people from smoking while there. If a man was smoking while walking near a police station and he didn’t listen to the sign, he would have questions asked to him or be arrested by police. 

Smoking can cause heart attacks, if continued for years of using tobacco or any other powders used for smoking, including marijuana. Smoking can cause mental, as well as physical health problems, such as schizophrenia, depression, mood swings and many others. If a smoker continues smoking for years, or even decades, their health will worsen. Smoking can cause coughing, or inflammation (swelling) of the throat or lungs. The alveoli are air sacs via which breathing happens, but they will become badly damaged. Once breathed in, the tobacco smoke travels down the trachea and enters the lungs. When entering the body, the smoke would damage the cilia, which are millions of small hairs that push away mucus when it enters the body. If the lungs become even more damaged, smokers may not be able to breathe on their own, and they will be put on a device to help them breathe such as a ventilator. In some cases, smoking causes the lining of the lungs to become inflamed, making the smoker unable to breathe, which leads to death.

Samaton

Samaton (/saa-ma-ton/) or Samadon (/saa-ma-don/) is a mythical winged divine horse in Meitei mythology. He is one of the most recognised creatures in Meitei folklore. Legend says that Samaton is the ancestor of the present day Manipuri pony (Meitei horse). The Leithak Leikharol describes Samaton as a primordial horse associated with Meitei cosmology. It is created by Sanamahi to attack on Pakhangba. Later, it became the mounting creature of God Marjing. It is also called ""Shamadon Ayangba"" () or ""Shamaton Ayangpa"" () due to free variation of words in Meitei language (Manipuri language).

Samaton is praised in the ritual song of Ougri sung during the Lai Haraoba festival. Samaton is considered very important to Meitei culture because it is created from the body of God Sanamahi. During the deification of Meitei kings, Samaton became associated with kings as it was a divine being. So, Samaton became the insignia of royalty.



Unhexoctium

Unhexoctium (), also known as eka-flerovium, dvi-lead, or element 168, is the possible chemical element in the periodic table that has the temporary symbol Uho and has the atomic number 168. Due to instabilities, it is not known if this element is physically possible, but if possible, Unhexoctium is predicted to be the last period 8 element in group 14. It should have an atomic mass around 490. 

As of October 2022, no attempt has ever been made to make Unhexoctium, nor has any plans been made known to attempt to make Unhexoctium.

The name Unhexoctium is a systematic element name, used as a placeholder until it is confirmed by other research groups and the IUPAC decides on a name. Usually, the name suggested by the discoverer(s) is chosen.

Unhexoctium is highly likely to be too unstable to be detected, which would allow very little study of it.

Unhexoctium is probably a post-transition metal, although it might be a noble gas. A likely oxidation state is +4, based on the oxidation states of Flerovium and Lead.

The Australian magpie ("Gymnorhina tibicen") is a large black-and-white bird. It lives in most parts of Australia and in a small part of New Guinea. It is not closely related to the European magpie: they just look rather similar.

Australian magpies are related to butcherbirds and currawongs. They are in the family Artamidae. 

The Australian magpie is in its own genus "Gymnorhina" and is related to the black butcherbird ("Melloria quoyi"). They live in bush land and in cities near people. 

Australian magpies are from 37 to 43 cm long. They do not have very long tails like European magpies. 
An adult magpie has red eyes, black legs, and a white beak with black tip. 
There are nine kinds of magpies (subspecies or races) in different parts of the country. Some subspecies have black backs and some have white.

They walk on the ground where they look for insects and lizards to eat. Many other birds hop (move with small jumps), but magpies walk. When they are not looking for food, they stand or perch by holding on with their feet while they stand or crouch in trees or on man-made structures. 

When magpies have baby chicks in their nests, the adults will “swoop” at nearby people – flying at their heads – to chase them away.

Some people feed magpies by throwing small pieces of meat to them. Magpies can learn to come near humans for food. They do not usually let people touch them.

National anthem of Croatia

"Lijepa naša domovino" (; "Our Beautiful Homeland") is the national anthem of Croatia. Croatian poet Antun Mihanović wrote the words to it in 1835. Serbian composer Josif Runjanin made the music to it in 1846. The Croatian government made it a national anthem in 1972. Before that, it was often sung by the people as an anthem. 

The anthem was first called "Horvatska domovina" ("Croatian homeland"). Some years later, people started calling it by how it's called today. The words of the anthem are also shorter today. Croatians often say the words "Lijepa naša" ("Our beautiful") instead of saying "Croatia".

Unsepttrium

Unsepttrium (), also known as dvi-francium , eka-Ununennium, or element 173, is a possible chemical element which has not been observed to occur naturally, nor has it yet been made. Due to instabilities, it is not known if this element is possible, as the instabilities may hint that the periodic table ends soon after the island of stability at unbihexium; however, if possible, it is likely the heaviest possible neutral element. Its atomic number is 173 and its atomic symbol is Ust.

The name "unsepttrium" is a temporary IUPAC systematic element name.

Although Richard Feynman noted that a simplistic interpretation of the relativistic Dirac equation runs into problems with electron orbitals at "Z" > 1/α = 137, suggesting that neutral atoms cannot exist beyond untriseptium, and that a periodic table of elements based on electron orbitals breaks down at this point, a more thorough analysis calculates the limit to be "Z" ≈ 173, meaning that neutral atoms most likely cannot exist with atomic number greater than 173. This makes unsepttrium theoretically the heaviest neutral element possible.

Australasian strewnfield

The Australasian strewnfield is the youngest and largest of the tektite strewnfields. Recent estimates suggest it may cover 10%30% of the Earth's surface. Tektites are gravel-sized bodies composed of black, green, brown, or grey natural glass. They are formed from terrestrial debris ejected by meteorite impacts.

The strewnfield is about c. 790,000-year-old. It includes most of Southeast Asia (Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Southern China). The material from the impact stretches across the ocean to include the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Java. It also reaches far west out into the Indian Ocean, and south to Australia and Tasmania. Since the 1960s, it has been accepted that the strewn field included Hainan in southern China to Australia or about 10% of the Earth's surface. This was later extended by finds in Africa and Tasmania to 20%. Recent additional finds in northern Tibet and Guangxi increased the strewnfield to about 30% of the Earth's surface, or almost 150 million km, or about the size of the entire world's landmass.

The glass comes from the melting of local rocks due to the impact of a large meteorite. The assumed source is a 1.2-kilometer-wide topographic depression in Tasmania known as Darwin Crater. The crater is filled with 230 metres of sediments and breccia. A crater of that size would be caused by a meteorite 20 to 50 metres in diameter.

Tektite

Tektites (from Greek , "molten") are gravel-sized bodies of natural glass. They come in green or brown (usually). They are formed from terrestrial debris ejected during meteorite impacts. The term was coined by Austrian geologist Franz Eduard Suess (1867–1941). They generally range in size from millimeters to centimeters. Millimeter-scale tektites are known as microtektites.

In 1849 he discovered anhydrous nitric acid (nitrogen pentoxide), a substance interesting as the first obtained of the so-called "anhydrides" of the monobasic acids. In 1854, he succeeded in making metallic aluminium, and he thought of a method by which the metal could be prepared on a large scale by the aid of sodium, the manufacture of which he also developed. Together with Friedrich Wöhler, he discovered silicon nitride in 1857.

Hall–Héroult process

The Hall–Héroult process is the major industrial process for smelting aluminium. It involves dissolving aluminium oxide (alumina) (mainly from bauxite, aluminium's chief ore, through the Bayer process) in molten cryolite, and electrolysing the molten salt bath, usually in a purpose-built cell. The Hall–Héroult process applied at industrial scale happens at 940–980 °C and produces 99.5–99.8% pure aluminium. Recycled aluminum requires no electrolysis, thus it does not end up in this process. This process contributes to climate change through the emission of carbon dioxide in the electrolytic reaction.

Isobar

In meteorology, an isobar is a line on a map that connects areas with the same atmospheric pressure. Wind is generally perpendicular to isobars. When looking at the difference in pressure, it is also possible to estimate wind direction and speed. The first person to use isobars was Alexander Buchan (1829-1907).

Isobaric process

In thermodynamics, an isobaric process is a process, where the pressure stays constant. To get an ideal gas to a different temperature, more heat is needed, because some heat will be used to expand the gas. This is different in an isochoric process, where the volume of the gas does not change. 

La Palma

Las Palmas de Gran Canaria is the capital of the Canary Islands. It is on a different island.

La Palma's highest mountain is the Roque de los Muchachos, at above sea level, being second among the peaks of the Canaries only to the peaks of the Teide massif on Tenerife. La Palma is above the ocean floor.

Like all the other islands of the Canary Islands, La Palma was created by volcanoes on the bottom of the sea, and is the most active volcanic island. In 1815, the German geologist Leopold von Buch visited the Canary Islands. He had been visiting Tenerife, where he visited the Las Cañadas caldera, and then later to La Palma, where he visited the Taburiente caldera, that the Spanish word for cauldron or large cooking pot – "caldera" – became a word that geologists use.

Intrusive thought

Intrusive thoughts are obsessive (repeating) unwanted thoughts that someone has that make them feel sad, angry, annoyed, embarrassed, depressed, or even suicidal that led them to feel anxiety or sometimes, even panic attacks. It is normal for everyone to have intrusive thoughts, though some people find it very hard to move on from them because they feel so real.

Intrusive thoughts are most common in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which is when someone with OCD gets intrusive thoughts that give them extreme anxiety and cause them to do the same ritual over and over again because they feel like bad things will happen if they don't do it. The difference between someone who has OCD and someone who does not is most people without OCD are able to ignore the thoughts, but people with OCD feel like they are holding them back and will not leave them alone. Intrusive thoughts are also associated with depression, body dysmorphic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

The Island Negros, which is part of the Philippines today, was named after the Negritos. Because the term 'Negrito' doesn't allow a precise scientific definition, most scientists (ethnologues) no longer use the term either.

Genetic research found them to be more closely related to non-Negrito local populations than to each other. Many Negrito people share genetic ancestry with East Asians. Their physical and morphological features were found to be local adaptions to tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, rather than a remnant of a shared common ancestor, as suggested previously.

History of Arabia

The Arabian Peninsula has been home to Semitic people for thousands of years. These people include the Arabs, but not all Arabs live in Arabia. People from the Arabian Desert, known as Bedouins, herded animals as nomads. They were grouped into extended families and tribes. People from other parts of it lived in villages and towns.

Around 3000 BC, people near the Persian Gulf were trading with Mesopotamia. Dilmun which is now Bahrain, was the center of trade. By 2000 BC, parts of South Arabian Peninsula were trading with Ancient Egypt. During the peaks of their empires, Assyria and Babylonia controlled North and West Arabian Peninsula. 

Sometime around 1000 BC, the kingdom of Saba' appeared in South Arabian Peninsula. There were also other kingdoms in South Arabian Peninsula, including Ma'in and Hadhramaut. In the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, Parthia expanded into South and East Arabian Peninsula. Saba' and Parthia became richer because of trade between Egypt and India. In the 1st century BC, Saba' conquered Ma'in. Near Saba', around 115 BC, the kingdom of Himyar appeared. In North Arabian Peninsula, Nabat was a trading kingdom in the 5th century BC. In 106 AD, the Roman Empire took control of Nabat. Parthia lost some wars to Rome and then left East Arabian Peninsula. The Bedouins expanded their area into more parts. Some of them moved to the East and North. 

By the 4th century (300-400) AD, Himyar conquered all other kingdoms of South Arabian Peninsula. Christianity came to Arabian Peninsula, from Abyssinia and Syria. Some people in Himyar followed Judaism. A Jewish king of Himyar killed Christians. Abyssinia and Rome ruled by Justinian were both Christian countries. In 525 they attacked Himyar. In North and Central Arabian Peninsula, two kingdoms had appeared in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD: The Lakhmids and the Ghassanids. The Sassanid Empire from Persia supported the Lakhmids (and Himyar), and Rome supported the Ghassanids. These two empires were at war. In the 6th century the Bedouins fought each other in wars called the Jahiliyyah.

In 610, Muhammad, an Arab from Mecca, claimed that God was speaking to him. The people of Mecca, mostly from the Quraysh tribe, worshipped many gods. Muhammad said that there was only one God. Muhammad founded the religion of Islam, and his followers, called Muslims, conquered Arabian Peninsula by war. After Muhammad died in 632, men called caliphs ruled the Muslims in empires called caliphates. These include the Rashidun, Umayyad, and Abbasid caliphates. Some parts of Arabian Peninsula, including Oman, were not always part of the caliphates. Rulers from the 900s to the 1200s included the Fatimid Caliphate, Seljuk Empire, and Ayyubid dynasty. Islam was divided into two forms called Sunni and Shi'a, who fought wars against each other. Yemen and Oman were ruled by different people at times, including the Rasulid dynasty in Yemen.

The Hashemite Sharifs of Mecca ruled the Hejaz (Western Arabian Peninsula) region starting in the 900s. The Mamluk Empire from Egypt had control over the Sharifs in the 1300s. In 1517, the Ottoman Empire from Turkey conquered the Mamluks. The Ottomans took control in the Hejaz, Yemen, and other parts of Arabian Peninsula. European countries wanted to control more of Arabian Peninsula, so they fought wars against the Ottomans. Europeans, mainly the Portuguese, won some cities on the coast in the 1500s and 1600s. Persians won control in Oman, and Oman also built its own empire. In the 1700s, a new form of Islam called Wahhabism spread to nomads. In the 1800s Wahhabis led by the House of al-Saud went to war against the Ottoman Empire. Britain helped the Wahhabis and gave them countries along the Persian Gulf. Britain also took part of Yemen into the British Empire. In World War I, the Allied Powers fought against the Ottomans. The Ottomans lost the war, so the Allied Powers broke up their empire into smaller countries. In 1932 Ibn Saud, from the House of al-Saud, founded the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

In the creation myth, God Khamlangba was grown out of Atiya Sidaba. He was a great hunter, warrior and miner. He lived with Goddess Huimu Leima and a son named Amudon was born to them. After this, Khamlangba left Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur) for Tripura () in search of iron ores. When he returned to Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur), he settled in Kakching. The people of Kakching worshipped Him. Later, "Kakching Haraoba", a new form of Lai Haraoba was developed. This account is evident in the "Khamlangba Khunggumlon" text.

In another legend, God Khamlangba stayed for some time at a place named "Khuman Heiyel Loubuk". Later, he came to Kheraching. A person named "Nganba Tekcha Pamba Laihat Thouba" beheaded "Irum Lai Tubi Kokling Lengba". So, the place where God Khamlangba stayed was later known as Kakching Khullen and Kakching Wairi.

God Khamlangba participated in the divine polo match played among the gods. The divine polo match took place during the reign of the deified Meetei King Nongda Lairen Pakhangba as described in the Kangjeirol text. He was one of the 7 polo players in the northern team.

A ball is free to rotate on a hinge, 2 or 4 L-shaped nozzles stick out of the ball, the ball is to be filled with water, and a source of heat (such as fire) is placed underneath the ball, as the water gets hot, it turns to steam that forces its way out of the nozzles, pushing the ball around, therefore, the aeolipile is a kind of reaction turbine, and the nozzles use a similar principle to rockets.

No one really knows if the aeolipile was used for anything in ancient times. In modern times, they are used to teach physics and how steam engines work.

The office of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was created after the Northern Ireland government (at Stormont) was suspended. The government was later ended after civil problems.

Helloi

A Helloi () or a Heloi () is a female nature spirit in Meitei mythology, folklore and religion. Hellois look like beautiful young women. They often trick men to have sex with them. They are the most powerful among the female spirits. They can cause diseases.
The hellois are often known for their charming beauty, ecological balance and male submission (seduction). Hellois are sometimes seen as evil spirits in the forms of beautiful maidens.

Helloi Taret (lit. "Seven Hellois") are the seven sisters. They stay in the thick bushes or dark and dense forests. They also live in other places of wilderness like rivers and meadows.

Hellois are one of the most common female spirits believed in Meitei mythology and folklore. According to the Maibas (priests), hellois are the most powerful female spirits. They could spread diseases, especially sexually transmitted infections. Hellois attack men and cause disorder of mind. From men, women may get sick in their sexual organs. According to belief, the highest rate of such attacks occurs in March and April. It is the time of celebrating Yaoshang, a spring festival. At the same time, Thabal Chongba occasions are performed by both men and women.

"Helloi Oknaba" (lit. "Encounter with Hellois" in Meitei) is one of the most common events of meeting with supernatural beings in Meitei folk stories. Challenges to or conflicts with the hellois often make one's life unhappy. In such cases, one may get sick, mental imbalance and temporary madness. If such people are not properly treated by a maiba or a maibi, the symptoms may continue long. It may lead to permanent madness (mental impairment). One who meets a helloi often acts in abnormal and mentally challenged ways. For example, the victims may not be able to recognize his family members and friends. However, the victims could still communicate with the very helloi. The spirit may not easily leave the victim. She will demand something in return to leave the victim. Thus, Hellois seek their needs by bewitching people.

The maibas perform rites and rituals to prevent attraction and attacks on men by the hellois. They feed the spirits with animal faeces and some specially prepared ritual foods.

Hellois and Hingchabis are the two most popular forms of female spirits in Meitei mythology and folklore. But these two mythical beings are not almost all similar. Hellois are wandering spirits. On the other hand, Hingchabis live inside some women. They exposed their supernatural powers into the bodies of the victims. They cause illness, mental sufferings, bad luck, and sometimes even death to the victims.

Field Spaniel

The Field Spaniel is a mid-sized spaniel dog. They were first developed to be show dogs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries because they were not as good at hunting as their cousins the English Springer Spaniels and Cocker Spaniels. Later in the 20th century they were bred to have longer legs and became good gun dogs.

They are coloured either brown or black and might have white marks on their chest.

They can make good family pets and are usually good at being around children.

They are now (2021) thought to be a rare breed but their numbers are starting to grow.

Clionidae

Clionoidae is a family of molluscs known as "sea angels". They are in the subclass Heterobranchia, class Gastropoda. They are small pelagic gastropods. 

Sea angels are pelagic, meaning that they live in the open ocean. They can be found all over the world, but are most common in cold waters, especially around the poles. 

Sea angels are usually around 1-2 centimeters in length, with average sizes varying between species. The largest species, "Clione limacina," can reach lengths of up to 8.5 centimeters. 

Sea angels are carnivores. Their main food source is "Thecosomata," or "sea butterflies", a clade of sea snails that are related to sea angels. When sea butterflies are not available, they can survive by feeding on small crustaceans. "Clione limacina" can survive for a year without food. 

Carbon dioxide released by human activity reacts with ocean water in such a way that the ocean becomes more acidic. This process is known as ocean acidification. More acidic oceans make it harder for some shell-producing animals to survive. This includes sea butterflies, which are sea snails with very thin shells. Since sea angels are dependent on sea butterflies as a major food source, ocean acidification may impact sea angels as well. 

Clionoidea

Clionoidea is a group of molluscs. Clionoidea is a superfamily within the subclass Heterobranchia of the class Gastropoda.

The name "Khuman Pokpa" is made up of two words, "Khuman" and "Pokpa". In Meitei language (Manipuri language), "Pokpa" means "to beget (be the father of) or to give birth to". The word "Apokpa" comes from "Pokpa". Apokpas are the dead male members of a family for the last three generations. They can be the father, grandfather, or great grandfather of any living person. They looked after the family in the past. So, "Khuman Pokpa" or "Khuman Apokpa" means "The one who gave birth to the Khumans".

Meitei people worship fire in the fireplace called "Phunga Mei" (lit. "hearth fire") at home. In the fireplace, there are three stones kept. One stone is in the right west, another in the north east and another in the south east. This forms a triangle. These three stones represent the three great times of a day. The northeastern stone represents the Mangang. The southeastern stone represents the Luwang. The western stone represents the Khuman. Here, Khuman represents the time of the sunset and the night. The remaining Mangang and Luwang represent the sunrise and the noon respectively. The Meiteis addressed the "hearth fire" ("phunga mei") as ""Meitreng Arabana Yoimayai Mahut Sinna Mei"". The English translation of this Meitei language (Manipuri language) passage is ""The burning fire in the hearth place substitutes the Sun"". Thus, the Sun is worshipped in the Meetei Phunga.

Among many, one of the most important pantheons of God Khuman Pokpa is in Mayang Imphal. Mayang Imphal is the ancient capital of the Khuman kingdom.

In ancient times, God Khuman Pokpa was worshipped for good health and prosperity. According to the beliefs of the fishermen of the Karang Island, diseases with unexplainable causes are caused by gods and goddesses. According to their beliefs, the danger of natural calamities, epidemics, diseases and other miseries are all due to the getting angry of gods and goddesses. The reasons for their anger are usually because of not performing rites and rituals.

The religious festival of Lai Haraoba is celebrated in honor of God Khuman Pokpa in the Karang Islands. The celebration lasts for ten consecutive days during the month of September. In modern days, the celebration draws attention to a large number of tourists.

Khoriphaba

Khoriphaba () is a God in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). He is the son of Sky God Salailen. He came down from heaven to earth to search for his mother and then for a bride. He is best known for wrestling with Loyalakpa in the Lai Haraoba festival. He is also a polo playing God.

God Khoriphaba is a Lainingthou. In Ancient Meitei language, "Lai" means God or Deity and "Ningthou" means King or Ruler. However, the term "Lainingthou" carries many meanings. It may refer to "king of gods", "godly king" or "kingly god". Since Khoriphaba is not the king of gods, he is a kingly god.

Khoriphaba is a sportsman. He participated in polo as well as wrestling championships.
Among the deities, God Khoriphaba and God Loyalakpa possess the epithets of being the best wrestlers. The two powerful gods wrestled during the Lai Haraoba festival.

God Khoriphaba is one of the polo player gods. He participated in the divine polo match. During the godly polo championship, Khoriphaba joined the southern team. His team was led by God Thangjing while his opponent's team (northern team) was led by God Marjing.

God Khoriphaba was born with the divine union of God Salailen (alias Soraren) and Goddess Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi at Heaven. When Khoriphaba was three months old (or "three years old"), his parents got separated. His mother was abandoned from entering into Heaven. So, little Khoriphaba was looked after by the 1000 queens of heaven. But he cried for his mother. Salailen tried to pacify the baby's cry but in vain. He gave him milk but it was of no use. He summoned his nobles and subjects. He asked them to make his son stop crying. Thousands of gods and goddesses tried but all of them failed to stop the boy's cry. Finally, Chingkheirel Apamba tried his luck. He sang hymns in praise of the baby God. Suddenly, the boy stopped crying. At this, Salailen named his son "Khoiriphaba".

One day, Angoupalba Yaibirel Sidaba found Khoiriphaba crying near a tree. He brought the boy to his home. He asked his family to take care of the boy. The clan members looked after the child like their own child. They named him "Puthiba".

One day, Khoiriphaba heard some women talking about him. They said, ""Look how cute the child is! We love him so much! His mother would have loved him many times than we love him. How much his mother would have suffered for the loss of the child."" Khoiriphaba immediately asked them about his mother. But none knew the answer to his question. So, he decided to search for his mother by himself.

God Khoriphaba descended from sky down to earth in search for his lost mother Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi.
He came to Moirang near Khoiri Keithel. The sun already set when he was there. Not knowing what to do, he started crying. God Thangjing and his consort Koiren Leima came to him. They came to know about the identity of the boy. The divine couple took care of Khoiriphaba.

Under the guardianship of God Thangjing, Khoiriphaba grew up. He made many friends. He was nine years old. He started wrestling (), race, and so on. He was always the champion of all the competitions. This made his friends fell jealous of him. So, one of his friends told him about how he grew up under the care of Thangjing. Khoriphaba was told that they would not allow him to play with them because he was an inferior God. Khoriphaba felt dejected for many days. Thangjing noticed it and asked him. Khoiriphaba narrated him the incident. So, Thangjing decided that Khoiriphaba should be sent to his mother without further delaying. He summoned all the 27 friends of Khoiriphaba. He asked them to challenge Khoiriphaba for wrestling and race championships. None were ready for the challenge. Then Thangjing asked them about a tug of war in which all of them would stand together at one side and Khoiriphaba alone at another side. There was a condition. If they won, they would be the winner. But if Khoiriphaba won, they should send Khoiriphaba off to his mother's place at Haorok Konthou, carrying him on a palanquin. The 27 friends accepted the challenge. But all of them got defeated in the hands of Khoiriphaba.

On the next day, the 27 friends proceeded for the journey with Khoiriphaba on a palanquin towards Haorok Konthou. They came from a long distance from Moirang. On the way, they came across a beautiful place. They could not control themselves to rest at the beautiful place for a while. They requested Khoiriphaba who agreed. The beautiful place where they rested was named ""Toubul"" (). Some friends were waiting for the resting friends at another place. The place where they waited was named ""Ngaikhong"". After some time, little by little, all of his friends left Khoiriphaba alone. So, Khoiriphaba continued his journey alone. On the way, he came across a river. On the river, many women were fishing using nets. Since morning, they could not catch a single fish. He was helped by a woman to cross the river.

Finally, he reached Haorok Konthou. The people of the place were greatly awed to see him. They have heard of his quest. But Goddess Tampha was not at the place. Due to the fear of Salailen, the villagers sent her off to another place. She was looked after by the Kabui tribes in the hills. So, Khoriphaba set off for the next journey riding on his mare Ngangrubi.

On reaching the village of the Kabui tribes in the hills, he was warmly welcomed by the tribesmen. He finally met his long departed mother. He proposed her to return home back to heaven. But she did not agree because she was abandoned by her husband. So, he sadly left his mother.

There are also legends about God Khoriphaba looking for a bride. He veiled his face and hold a polo-stick over his shoulder. While searching for a lover, he was riding on a mare.

God Khoriphaba reached Koubru's place. God Koubru offered him to choose any lady of his choice from his place. Khoriphaba chose Goddess Nungthel Leima. But Nungthel Leima was already the consort of Loyalakpa. So, God Koubru could not give him the desired lady. Koubru did not want to take back his own words. He asked Khoriphaba to choose any lady but he should do it blindfolded. Blindfolded Khoiriphaba attempted to choose but he could not get Goddess Nungthel Leima. This action is enacted by the maibis in the Lai Haraoba festival.

During the Lai Haraoba festival, there is a special ritual named "Kanglei Thokpa" dedicated to God Khoriphaba. In this ritual, a group of maibis sing a song depicting Khoriphaba's search for a bride.

<poem>
"The goddess of the hills, my beloved
The jewel, which I am unable to part with
On such a day, I follow your footprints
I fail to find you...
Sweet one, have you gone to another village?
Or have you gone to fetch fire from your neighbour?
Or have you gone to wash your hair at the riverbank?
Or are you combing your beautiful hair in the huge house of your father?
Perhaps, you have gone to a kang game and seated between two village brothers as a piece of decoration, radiating...
Perhaps, a cloth is tied around your shoulder and slender waist and you are pounding rice.
My friend, I have not seen my beloved for a long time.
Please tell me where she is? "
</poem>

This song of love and associated gesture evolve into dancing. The dance enacts the horse polo game. During this ritual ceremony, a maibi will cover her face with a veil. She will hold a kangjei (English: polo-stick or hockey-stick). She will hook a girl from amidst the crowd with the hooked end of the stick. This is called "Lai Nupi Thiba" (lit. Predilection of bride).

During his worship, cooked foods could be offered but devotees are not allowed to offer fish.

The "Khoriphaba Naothemlon" text describes song to stop little Khoriphaba from crying.
The Khoriphaba Artistes Association is a non commercial artistes association. It was established in 1971 in Imphal.

The Mr. Khoriphaba Body Building Championship is an annual bodybuilding event. It includes both men's as well as women's classes. The first championship took place in the year 2019.

Far Eastern Championship Games

The Far Eastern Championship Games (also known as the Far Eastern Championships, Far Eastern Games or Far East Games) was an Asian multi-sport event considered to be a precursor to the Asian Games.

In 1913, Elwood Brown, president of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Association and Manila Carnival Games, proposed the creation of the ""Far Eastern Olympic Games"" to China and Japan. It was at that time that Governor-General William Cameron Forbes was the president of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation from 1911-1913. Governor-General Forbes formed the Far Eastern Olympic Association.

The first event was held on the Manila Carnival grounds (later the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex) in Malate, Manila, Philippines on February 4, 1913 and was known as the "First Oriental Olympic Games". Forbes was also the one who formally declare the games open. Six countries participated in the eight-day event: the host country then-named Philippine Islands, Republic of China, Empire of Japan, British East Indies (Malaysia), Kingdom of Thailand and British crown colony Hong Kong.

In 1915, the name changed to Far Eastern Championship Games and the association to Far Eastern Athletic Association when the event was held at Hongkou Park in Shanghai, China. They were held there again in 1921. The games were held every two years except in 1929 when Japan decided to delay the project to 1930. The FEAA decided to change the time table to four years and the Philippine Islands hosted the tenth games in 1934. Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) joined in the 1934 FECG.

The 1934 edition was held in a period of dispute between China and Japan, following the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931. Inclusion of people from this region in the games caused controversy between the two member nations, which resulted in the break-up of the Far Eastern Athletic Association. In September 1937, Japan invaded China with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and started the Second Sino-Japanese War (which later became part of World War II), thus the planned games in 1938 were cancelled.

A total of nine different sports were contested over the lifetime of the competition. Eight of the sports featured on each programmes of the games, with the ninth sport – cycling – being held once only, in 1915.

In 2004 the L.League was renamed to Nadeshiko League, with the nickname "Nadeshiko Japan". "Nadeshiko" is the name of the dianthus flower and was chosen from suggestions by fans, signifying an ideal of a dutiful Japanese woman.

Starting in the 2004 season, the L.League had 2 divisions – Division 1, with 8 clubs, and Division 2, with 8 clubs in the 2006 season. Until 2009 the league operated in the same way as the old Japan Soccer League for men, the bottom club in the second division playing off against a regional league playoff winner.

Starting with the 2010 season, the second division is divided into an east and west group of six teams each. The winners of each group are promoted. In 2015 this became Division 3, with the Nadeshiko League becoming two divisions of 10 teams each.

After Japan's World Cup win in 2011 the L.League saw an upsurge in popularity.

On 3 June 2020, the Japan Football Association announced that the newly established WE League will become the top level for women's football in Japan when it begins play in 2021. The Nadeshiko League will then become the second to fourth levels of the Japanese women's football pyramid.

The Nadeshiko League Divisions 1 and 2 consist of 10 teams each. The Nadeshiko Challenge League is divided into two groups (East and West) of six teams each.

The following clubs are not competing in the Nadeshiko League during the 2020 season, but have previously competed in the Nadeshiko League for at least one season.



Clubs in bold are those competing in Division 1 as of the 2020 season. Clubs in "italic" no longer exist.

Java ARchive (JAR) is a file format created by the Oracle Corporation that is based on the ZIP file format. The primary motivation for the creation of JAR was to allow Java applets and their files to download using a single HTTP connection instead of a new connection for each piece. This allows webpages to load faster and the applet can begin functioning.

JAR files use the file extension .jar and the MIME media type codice_1. JAR files are packaged with the ZIP file format, and they are used for data compression, archiving, decompression, and archive unpacking. 

Lowland burrowing tree frog

The burrowing tree frog, lowland burrowing tree frog, northern casque-headed frog, or northern casquehead frog ("Smilisca fodiens") is a frog that lives in northern Mexico and southern Arizona.

The adult frog is 54 to 63 mm long from nose to rear end. The male frogs and female frogs are about the same size. Its hind legs are short and strong. It has more bone in its head than most frogs do. Its toes have discs for climbing. Its front toes are not webbed. It is gray-brown, green-prown, or pink-brown in color.

Scientists say this frog is related to "Smilisca dentata".

This frog burrows into the ground in grasslands or scrub forests. It can also form a cocoon to stop water from leaving its body. It makes the cocoon by shedding its skin.

These frogs lay eggs after it rains, in bodies of water than dry up.

Nongdā Lāiren Pākhangba

Nongda Lairen Pakhangba (') or Nongda Lairel Pakhangba (') was officially the first Meitei king of the Ningthouja dynasty. He was coronated in the Kangla of Kangleipak (" realm") in 33 AD. He rose to power after defeating the Khabas.

According to Paratt, before the times of king Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, the "salai"s () were already in existence.

Nongda Lairen Pakhangba started unifying the warring ethnic groups and principality groups positively. It led to the formation of Manipur realm, under the political supremacy of the Ningthouja dynasty (Mangang clan) in the first century AD. Despite the historical context, with the usage of the title "Pakhangba", he was often deified with various mythological tales, revolving around his identity as a human incarnation of God Pakhangba (frequently mentioned in the alias "Konjil Tuthokpa").

According to Sujit Mukherjee, Nongda Lairen Pakhangba ruled from 33 AD to 54 AD ("21 years of reign"). The Cheitharol Kumbaba also recorded the list of Meitei kings, starting from Nongda Lairen Pakhangba. The record has several versions. However, the most authentic record is the one that is preserved in the Royal Palace of Manipur. The information on the Cheitharol Kumbaba is supplemented by that in the , which also records the details of the Meitei kings, starting from Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, regarding their parentage and important events in their reigns.

According to Prof. P. Gunindra Singh, coins were issued by Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, which served as one of the significant evidences relevant to the study of the subject.

One of the most remarkable historical events occurred during the times of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba was the organising of a match of polo () sports, played by his friends, in the (), the oldest Polo Ground in the world.

The name ""Pakhangpa"" () was mentioned in the ancient Meitei text, named the "Thanglon Thangchat". However, due to the given name "Pakhangba", being possessed by multiple historical personalities in ancient times, the identity of the "Pakhangba" mentioned in the text is questionable. Notably, there were four notable people named "Pakhangba", who are (1) "Leinung Lonja Ariba Pakhangba", (2) "Tangja Leela Pakhangba", (3) "Lolang Pakhangba", and (4) "Nongda Lairen Pakhangba" himself. They lived in different times in the history of Manipur.

The title "Pakhangba" is used by the historical kings who are considered to be "enlightened". King Nongta Lailen ("Nongda Lairen") was one among the historical personalities to use the title "Pakhangba". Many scholars compared the usage of the title "Pakhangba" by Meitei kings with that of the title "Buddha", used by the people who are considered to be "The Awakened One" or "The Enlightened One". 
King Pakhangba inherited the political powers as he followed the traditional practices of his forefathers and paid respect for his ancestral rituals.
According to Hareshwar Goshwami's ""History of the People of Manipur"" as well as the ancient Meitei text , Nongda Lairen Pakhangba subjugated the powers of "Sorarel Ariba Ahum", who were the chiefs of three clans, viz. Chengleis, Luwangs and Nganbas.
Nongda Lairen Pakhangba was challenged by Poireiton, for the throne of the Kangla. In the conflict, the former defeated the latter. With the accession of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba to the throne of the Kangla, other clans including the Chengleis and Khaba Nganbas lost their sovereignty. The Angoms and the Luwangs, though independent, shared their political powers with Nongda Lairen Pakhangba.

Some scholars opined that under the administration of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, his capital was divided into 4 ""pana""s (). The 4 panas include Ahallup Pana, Naharup Pana, Laipham Pana and Khabam Pana. However, some scholars are of the opinion that the "Pana" system is a later interpolation, by stating that "Pana" came into existence during Meitei King Khagemba's era.

Nongda Lairen Pakhangba's queen consort, Leima Leisana (also called "Laisna"), was a maibi (). Leisana and her brother "Poireiton" had their origin from a distant place in the east. When she and her brother came to the realm of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, they were accompanied by the Poirei people. She brought two hundred varieties of fruits and vegetables. Legend says that one hundred of the varieties were meant to be cooked and the rest of the hundred were meant to be eaten raw.

During the reign of king Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, the ""Kuchu"" (, /kū.chū/) was established in his kingdom. It was the highest level court (supreme court), having legal jurisdictions over both criminal cases as well as civil cases. The king was the president of the court, and his nobles as well as ministers served as its members.
The ""Kuchu"" court also used to perform trials of women's cases. The concept of the liberation of women (feminist movement) was already prevalent in that era. The roles of women in their families' decision making processes were considerably significant.

The ""Cheirap"" ("derived from the word "Cheirak"") was established during the reign of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in his kingdom. In Meitei language, ""Cheirap"" (, /cə́i.rap/) means "court". In Meitei language, ""Cheirak"" (, /cə́i.rak/) means ""punishment"" or ""said of strict control to enforce obedience"".

Starting from the era of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in the 1st century AD, "Pacha Loishang" (also spelled as ""Patcha"")() was established in Kangleipak. The court protected the women's rights, privileges, rights against immoral trafficks. During his time, his queen consort "Laisna" presided over the court, dealing all women related crimes.

The Lallup system was established during the reign of King Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in his kingdom. The ""Lallup"" (also spelled as ""Lalup"") was a practice of forced labor and free labour in services to the sovereign or to the state.

When Nongda Lairen Pakhangba and his queen consort "Laishna" were coronated in 33 AD, the ritual song ""Ougri"" was sung. ""Ougri"" ritual song can bring either prosperity or ruination to the civilization. Since then, it became customary to recite ""Ougri"" during the coronations of every Meitei kings. These recitations of the verses, during the royal coronation of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in 33 AD, were recorded in the ancient text, ""Laisrapham"".

During the era of "Nongda Lairen Pakhangba", a court singer named "Leinung Tharuk Asheiba" initiated the performance of the traditional musical instrument Pena.

According to Dr. Yumlembam Gopi, the Ancient Meiteis used to play "khung", a playing instrument, prior to the era of "Nongda Lairen Pakhangba" in 33 AD. The "khung" (, /kʰuŋ/) is a cone-shaped toy, similar to the top.

The Hiyang Tannaba () festival had been celebrated since the time of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in his kingdom.

The Mera Hou Chongba (also spelled as "Mera Hao Chonba") was believed to be introduced by Nongda Lairen Pakhangba. It is a festival in which dignitaries from all the ethnic groups assembled together in the Kangla. It is annually celebrated on the 10th day of the Meitei lunar month of "Mera" (October-November interface month).

During the reigns of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in the 1st century AD, his younger sister named "Panthoibi", established the ""Ametpa Loishang"" (). The Loishang () used to perform the treatment and the diagnosis of diseases and sicknesses, including boils, abscesses, ulcers, etc. ""Laibi"", a post in that office, supervised the procedures. ""Metpi""s used to perform delivery and child birth. ""Metpi Laibi""s were responsible for the treatment of diseases for the Queen and other imperial consorts. ""Metpi Laibi""s always used to accompany the king wherever he went, by bringing medical tools and medicines. The text ""Loishangi Thouram Thougal"" mentioned about the duties of the Loishang and the ""Laibi"". The text ""Masil"" (also spelled as ""Masin"", ) mentioned about the ""Metpi""s and the ""Metpi Laibi""s.

Though almost all the scholars have a consensus on the year of the coronation of King Nongda Lairen Pakhangba as AD 33, regarding the year of the end of his reign, which maybe either due to his death or due to being abdicated, is still disputed.

In accordance with Sujit Mukherjee, Nongda Lairen Pakhangba ruled from 33 AD to 54 AD ("21 years of reign").

Many sources claim that Nongda Lairen Pakhangba ruled from 33 AD to 153 AD (120 years of reign).

Many sources claim that Nongda Lairen Pakhangba ruled from 33 AD to 154 AD (121 years of reign).

AD 54, AD 153 or AD 154 maybe either his year of "death" or "removal from the power of monarchy", which is not confirmed.

Some scientists estimate that in case of the most ideal conditions people can live up to 127 years. This does not exclude the theoretical possibility that in the case of a fortunate combination of mutations there could be a person who lives longer. 
Some scientists cautiously suggest that the human body can have sufficient resources to live up to 150 years.

According to Anuradha Dutta and ‎Ratna Bhuyan, Nongda Lairen Pakhangba was murdered and his queen Laisana saved their son, "the prince".

Nongda Lairen Pakhangba was considered as an ancestor, later worshipped as a God. Some scholars opined that people of later generations wove mythological stories around him. However, some are of the opinion that he was a God living with the human beings and behaving like a normal human.

According to superstitious people, Pakhangba was a demigod, appearing "divine" in daytime and appearing "humanly" in nighttime. With this, the theory of Meitei kings being of "divine origin" started. The identity of the historical king Pakhangba got mingled up with that of the serpentine dragon god Pakhangba of ancient Meitei mythology and religion.

According to 's "The Meitheis" (1908), with the influence of Hinduism, new mythological tales tainted the identity of King Pakhangba. According to one Hindu lore, King Pakhangba was said to be born to "Enoog Howba Chonoo", who was said to be the wife of Babrubahana, by the end of the Dvapara Yuga ("Dapar Jug") and by the beginning of the Kali Yuga ("Kali Jug"), which is estimated to be around the year 3435. Hindu names were given as aliases to King Pakhangba. For example, "Jobista" (also spelled as "Yavista") was given as a synonym for King Pakhangba. According to another Hindu lore, King Pakhangba was claimed as the grandson of Babruvahana (Arjuna's son) and the son of Sooprabahoo (Babruvahana's son), thereby drawing relationship with the characters in the Mahabharata.

In the 18th century AD, the "Vijay Panchali" (also spelled as ""Bijoy Panchali"") composed by Shantidas Goswami, a Hindu missionary, attempting to erase the history and the culture of Manipur, projected the land of northeast India's Manipur as the Manipur of the Mahabharata and claimed Babruvahana (Arjuna's son) as the father of King Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, by identifying him as "Yavistha".

Notably, in the year 2020, ""A Short History of Manipur"", a book written by Rajkumar Jhalajit Singh, was banned from publishing and selling by the author's own family members, because the book misleads the readers that the Manipuris are the descendants of Arjuna of the Mahabharata.

In the Kangla of Imphal, Manipur, there is an annual flag hoisting ceremony of "Nongda Lairen Pakhangba" organised by Nahanong Kanglei Laining Liklam (NKLL). 
Ritual ceremonies are performed and the ""Salai Taret Huiyen Lalong Thang-Ta Lup"", giving guard of honour, hoists the flag of Nongda Lairen Phakhangba.
The ceremony is performed for the purpose to preserve and promote the indigenous art and culture of Kangleipak.

Phouoibi Waron

The Phouoibi Waron () or the Phouoibi Warol () is an old Meitei text (PuYa) written in a period between 13th and 14th century AD. It deals with the life story of the lovers of Phouoibi, the goddess of agricultural crops and harvest in Meitei mythology and religion (Sanamahism).

The story in the text is a very usual product of the agriculture of Ancient Manipur (Antique Kangleipak). Phouoibi is believed to be very fickle in love. She has multiple lovers. Her lovers are generally mortals. She doesn't live with anyone of them forever. She travels from place to place and makes love with many mortals. But she leaves them after some time. She lives with some of her favourite lovers for some time but she leaves them too. The nature of the goddess of agricultural crops and harvest is imagined to be fickle or tricky. This symbolises that wealth isn't a permanent property. It doesn't last long to a certain place. Devastations due to battles and natural disasters were common in ancient times. It is the reason why the paddy goddess was considered to be very irregular in bestowing her favor to the mankind.

The Phouoibi Waron and many other PuYas reveal much about the Meitei rites and rituals of ancient times. These rites and rituals are still widely practiced by the maibas, maibis and others.

Franz Magill was the son of a day laborer. His father bought a small farm in Zuchen in 1908, where Magill graduated from elementary school. He was called up at the end of the First World War and after the end of the war in 1919 he became a volunteer in the Hussar Regiment No. 5 of the Reichswehr. In 1923 he was promoted to sergeant, and again in 1928. In 1929 he passed the riding instructor examination at the riding school in Belgard and, after leaving the Reichswehr, went to the private "German riding school" at Gut Düppel in Berlin as a qualified riding instructor.

After the National Socialists took power in 1933, Magill joined the SS and directed the riding instruction of an SS Reitersturms. In March 1935 he became a full-time SS leader riding instructor at the SS Junker School in Braunschweig and made a career there. At the end of 1935 he was promoted to SS-Hauptsturmführer and, after he joined the NSDAP in 1937 (membership number 4.137.171), to SS-Sturmbannführer on April 20, 1938.

Shortly after the attack on Poland, Magill received the order to set up SS cavalry squadrons in Gut Düppel and, in September 1939, in Lodsch in occupied Poland, then two months later in the Lublin district. There, the basis of the SS skull rider standards (two regiments) formed. In May 1940, Magill received an order from Hermann Fegelein to set up the 2nd SS-Totenkopf-Reiterstandard. Magill was not up to the task. In April 1941 he was recalled as leader of the 2nd regiment and commander of a cavalry division with four squadrons. The regimental leader of the 1st regiment was Hermann Fegelein and the 2nd regiment SS-Sturmbannführer was Heimo Hierthes (1897-1951). In the 1st regiment, Magill's position was held by SS-Sturmbannführer, Gustav Lombard.

Wi-Fi deauthentication attack

A Wi-Fi deauthenticatoon attack is a kind of denial of service attack that can be used in certain wireless networks. In a Wi-Fi network, devices such as computers communicate with a wireless access point. To get an iP address, each devices needs to be authenticated, so the access point knows the device. In this context, there also is a frame (or a command) that tells a device that it is no longer authenticated. As the protocol does not require these frames to be encrypted, an attacker can simply send such a command to deconnect a device. The attacker only needs to know the MAC address of the victim. This address is sent unencrypted with each frame.

Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi

Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi () or Chingphuron Konthousu () is a goddess in Meitei mythology and religion (Sanamahism) of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). She began as a human being in the Haorok Konthou group (Konthoujam clan). She is the wife of the sky god Salailen (alias Soraren). Her only child is Khoriphaba.

Konthoujamba and Konthoujambi were a couple with no child. They consulted maibas but the maibas could not help them have a child. They prayed to God Salailen, the King of Heaven, to help them. God Salailen heard their prayer and told the goddess Imoinu to help the couple. Goddess Imoinu implanted herself into the womb of Lady Konthoujambi.
When Konthoujambi was pregnant with a 3 month old fetus, God Salailen instructed her that her child will be His wife in the future. Later, Konthoujambi gave birth to a baby girl. The couple named their daughter "Chingphulon Konthousu" (later known as "Tampha").
As Chingphulon Konthousu grew up, she was known for her beauty and gentleness. She used to go to woods, lakes and open meadows for fun. One day, while Tampha was out in an open field with her friends, a strong wind blew. Tampha was lifted up by a whirlwind towards the sky. Her friends could do nothing but watch. The wind took her to heaven, the abode of Salailen. He was waiting for her.
Tampha was unhappy about being far away from her parents and friends. To please her, Salailen promised her that the people of her native place would attain immortality and be safe from all diseases. Still, her parents, family and friends cried for the loss of her. Salailen told them that Tampha was safe with him. He told them about the promises he kept to her. Many years had passed and Salailen and Tampha had a son. She and Salailen named their son Khoriphaba.

Tampha's parents wanted to see her. So they planned to meet her. Men went on a hunting expedition with their hunting dogs across the Thangjing Hills. Unfortunately, they could not catch even one animal. The tired hunters rested under the shade of a tree. Meanwhile, one of their favorite hunting dogs wandered away. The dog saw a large python sitting in sun. It barked at the python. The python killed it. Later, the hunters found the dead dog and carried it home. They prepared a funeral for the dog. The smoke from the funeral rose up towards the sky.
Up in Heaven, Tampha saw the smoke rising from her native place. She knew it was for a funeral. She worried about her people. Perhaps someone had died even though Salailen had promised to keep them safe from disease. She asked Salailen about his promises. Salailen told her that the funeral was only for a dog. She did not believe him and wanted to see her parents. Reluctantly, Salailen allowed her to meet people under some conditions. She should leave only after their son Khoriphaba had gone to sleep and should come back before he woke up. Also, she should not consume any earthly foods or drinks. Then, he placed a golden ladder (or "golden stairs" in another version) for her to climb down. She landed on the Thangjing Hill and then went to Konthoujam, her native land. She met her near and dear ones. Her mother offered Tampha delicious foods.
Tampha did not accept her mother's offers. However, her mother caught hold of her and tried to force her to eat. Tampha told her mother of the conditions with which she was leaving heaven to meet them on earth. Then, her mother arranged a shade with seven layers of false ceiling, enclosed by seven layers of drapery. Her plan was to block the vision of Salailen from above. Inside the shades, she served out delicious food for Tampha. Poor Tampha was compelled to eat what her mother had so lovingly prepared for her. But the God Salailen saw it happen even through the drapes. As Tampha started eating, Salailen proclaimed from heaven that she could not come back to his abode. He spat a blob of spit on her hand (or "on her food" in another version). The golden ladder (or "golden stairs" in another version) was also lifted up. Poor Tampha was abandoned from heaven. Salailen also took back his promises of immortality and immunity to disease. 
Later, she lived in the outskirts of Konthoujam. Since then, she came to be known as Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi.

Nashya Shaikh

The Nashya Shaikh or Nashya Sekh(Bengali: নইস্য শেখ) is a Muslim community found in northern parts of the state of West Bengal in India. They are culturally and linguistically similar to both Rangpuri people of northern Bangladesh and Goalpariya people of Assam. A small number of the community are also found in the neighboring state of Bihar, where they are known as the Bengali Shaikh. These people are more commonly known as Rajbongshi Muslims. The Nashya are considered to be an important indigenous group found in northern West Bengal. They are homogeneous with the Koch Rajbongshi people and are bi-linguistic speaking both Bengali language and Koch language with Koch Rajbongshi language being replaced by Bengali language among the newer generations.

There are descendants from Koch-Rajbonshi, Mech, Rabha, Bodo and Indo-Aryan people who converted to Islam. They mainly speak the Goalpariya dialect . They are mainly settled in the districts of Dhuburi, Goalpara, South Salmara and Kokrajhar. These people were loose followers of Hinduism. But when a small section of these people converted to Islam, the act was frowned upon. The local Hindus started calling them "nosto seikh" meaning "spoiled Shaikh". But as more number of people got converted to Islam with time these people came in contact with mainstream Muslims, and the term "nosto seikh" slowly got islamicised into "Nashya seikh".

The Nashyas trace their origin to the indigenous communities of Koch Rajbongshi of northern West Bengal, though some of them are also from Mech community. There conversion to Islam is said to have taken over two to three centuries, and the Nashya still retain many cultural traits of their pre-Islamic past. Most people of the community are non-practicing Muslims though the newer generations are becoming increasing Islamic due to globalization. From historic evidence, it seems a segment of the indigenous population of north Bengal converted started to convert to Islam when the region fell under the control of Bakhtiyar Khilji. Some of the earliest converts were the chiefs Ali Mach and Kala Pahar. Tradition also ascribes the conversion of several lineages to Sufi saints such as Torsa Pir, Pagla Pir, Shah Fakir Sahib and Shah Gari Sahib.

Pureiromba () or Puleilompa () is a God in Meitei mythology and religion. He is the giver of rain and good luck in farming. He is one of the major Umang Lai deities. He is the Ancestor God of the Angom clan of the Meitei ethnicity.

According to the Thalon text, Pureiromba () was one of the 5 gods of 5 different places of the Selloi Langmai Hill (Nongmaiching Hill). Before the Meitei King Ura Konthouba (c. 7th century CE) killed all the Selloi Langmai people, the cults of these five gods were put together into that of a single God with the name "Langmai Ningthou" (lit. "King of the Langmais"). The personal names became the other names or various forms of the God. With this, the tribal society of the Selloi Langmai people became one chiefdom. This chiefdom later became the Angom clan.

The people who worship Pureiromba () think of him as their ancestor. However, no one knows if he was a real person from history or a god that acted like a human. But the ancient texts that show his adventures in the human world show him as a strong, powerful and able founding ancestor. He was initially associated with a Loi village of Andro, Manipur. But in later times, the people of Moirang worshipped him as one of their deified ancestors.

The religious festival of Lai Haraoba is celebrated in honor of God Pureiromba () in the months of Kalen (April-May). The Haraoba of Pureiromba belongs to the type of the Chakpa Haraoba. Chakpa Haraoba is one of the four types of Lai Haraoba.
At Andro, Manipur, on the last day of the celebration of Pureiromba, a small mound of rice offerings is piled up by the maibis. Out of rice, the maibis construct a small landscape of mountain ranges, ravines, lakes, rivers, etc.

There are pantheons dedicated to God Pureiromba and his son Chinsongba in the village of Andro in Manipur.
God Pureiromba is also regarded as the ancestor of the people of the Sharumbam clan of Meitei ethnicity. The cult of Pureiromba was looked after by the people of Mangsatabam clan of Meitei ethnicity.

Panam Ningthou

Panam Ningthou () is a God in Meitei mythology and religion. He is the protector of crops, especially paddy from hailstorm and thunder. According to legends, He ignited fire for the first time by rubbing flints. He is one of the Umang Lai deities.

God Panam Ningthou has his major cult center in Andro village. The Andro village in Imphal East district of present day Manipur is an ancient village. People of this village worship fire that is kept burning from the time of Poireiton Khunthokpa (34 BC-18 BC). The fire is kept in the Chakpa Panam Ningthou Meihoupirol (lit. "Panam Ningthou sacred burning fireplace").

According to R. Constantine, the fire burning in Andro is the oldest man-made fire in India. It has been burning without break for centuries.
According to Thomas Callan Hodson (T.C. Hodson), Panam Ningthou is a rain and weather God of the Meitei people of Manipur. He recorded his description in his monograph The Meitheis published in 1908.

When it was one or two days before the Lai Haraoba festival of God Lainingthou Panam Ningthou begins, the God came to his temple in the form of a ball of light. He came flying from the east. He landed at a part of the Nongmaiching Hill. Sometimes, some people of Andro claimed to see that ball of light, even at other times of the year.

God Lainingthou Panam Ningthou has a wife named Leimaren Sanarik Chaning Khombi. Some people believed that she might be of Burmese origin. So, the God went to Burma () to meet her from time to time.

God Panam Ningthou is mainly worshipped by the people of Loi caste of Meitei ethnicity in Manipur. He has his major cult center in Andro village of Imphal East district of Manipur.

Shakespeare noted that the Loi people regarded God Panam Ningthou as a special deity of the Meitei king. He further noted that the King himself provided sacrificial animals to the God. Buffalo was one among the sacrificial animals used to be sacrificed during the Lai Haraoba festival. Pigs were sacrificed when there was no Lai Haraoba festival. Whenever there was any suspicion of danger to the Meitei king, the King would send a pig and a cock to be sacrificed to God Panam Ningthou of Andro.

The Chakpa Haraoba (one of the 4 types of Lai Haraoba festival) is annually celebrated in honor of God Panam Ningthou. The festive occasion falls in the Meitei lunar month of Lamta ("March-April interface month"). The festival starts from the first Sunday of the "Lamta" month.

During the 9 day long festival, no outsiders of Andro are allowed to stay at the village. In modern times, notice is issued one month before the festival begins through mass media like television, newspaper and radio. The notice informs outsiders to leave the place as it is about to begin the festival. Natives of Andro may come to Andro before the festival starts. Once the festival begins, no one is allowed to either leave from or come to the village. People who have converted into another religion are not allowed to participate in the religious festival even if they are native of Andro. There are some Christian converts and Hindu converts in Andro. 
During the festival, people of "Andro village" wear black clothes as a custom. Besides Panam Ningthou, there are twelve other deities worshipped in Andro. During the Lai Haraoba festivals of these deities, outsiders of Andro can witness the event. The festivals in their honor are done separately from that of Panam Ningthou. But the festival of Pureiromba can be done together with that of Panam Ningthou. At this too, outsiders can witness the event but the place of worship is different from the exclusive one of Panam Ningthou.

During the Haraoba of Panam Ningthou, there is no shortage of meat and wine. Boys and girls play important role in the festival.

The Temple of Panam Ningthou is in Andro, Manipur. It is also the Loishang (English: Office) to the representatives of the "pana"s (English: State Divisions). Sacred items are kept inside the temple. One house each for two "Pana"s was constructed near the Loishang. Two dormitories for boys and girls are also built.

The sanctum of God Lainingthou Panam Ningthou and Goddess Leimaren Sanarik Chaning Khombi are located in the right side corner and the left side corner respectively as one enters the room.

According to the Thalon text, Panam Ningthou was one of the 5 gods of 5 different places of the Selloi Langmai Hill. The cults of these five gods were integrated into that of a single God with the name "Langmai Ningthou" (lit. "King of the Langmais"). The personal names became the aliases or various forms of the God. With this, the tribal society of the Selloi Langmai people evolved into a chiefdom. This chiefdom later rose to the Angom clan.

There is a real servant class named "Panam Ningthou Semba". It takes care of the articles (things) related to polo () for the Meitei royalty. There are seven grades of officers in this group. The grades are (1) Sellungba Ahal, (2) Sellungba Naha, (3) Pakhan-lakpa, (4) Naharakpa, (5) Yaphi Ahal, (6) Yaphi Naha and (7) Sennakhal.

Serial-position effect

The serial position effect is a psychological phenomenon. It say that people are more likely to remember the first and last items on a list. They are less likely to remember the middle items. The term was created in 1913 by Herman Ebbinghaus. He was a German psychologist who was interested in testing his ability to remember items on a list. This ability is called free-recall. Ebbinghaus performed free-recall experiments on himself. He used a list of 2000 syllables. THe experiments showed him that the where the it was on the list affected how well he could remember it. This information is shown in the ""serial position curve"". The serial position curve shows two things. The first thing it showed him was that the first 2-3 items on the list and up to the last 8 items in a list are always remembered better than items in the middle. This was true in any list with 20 or more items. It also showed him that the size of the list and the speed at which it was preseted did not affect the outcome. 

Free recall is a way of experimenting that is used in psychology. It is used to test memory. Free recall is the most common method of studying the serial position effect. to use free recakk, a person is shown a list of items. These items are normally words. The person is then asked to say which items they can remember from the list in any order. One major problem with this method is that the tests are usually done in a controlled environment. This means the result may not be different from what happens in the real world.  

The primary effect is the term used to mean that people often remember the first thing they are told. Many psychologists think that this effect may be a result of rehearsal. When a person is trying to remember the items, that person will often repeat the items to themselves. As each item is added to the list, they repeat the entire list. This causes them to repeat the first it many time. This constant repeating helps them to better remember the items at the begining of the list,The slower the list is presented, the more time a person has to repeat the list. This causes a larger primacy effect.

In the 1970s, psychologists began testing the effect of rehearsal on the primacy effect. In 1972, psychologist Phillip Marshal tested if removing rehearsal would have an affect on the primacy effect. He did this by having the people sort the words while he was giving them a list of 18 common nouns. The people in the test were not told that their memmory was being tested. Since they did not know this, they did not repeat the words as they heard them. The experiments showed Marshal that removing the repeating also removed most of the primacy effect. It showed that rehearsal was a main cause for the primacy effect. 

In 1971, Dewey Rundus created a what he called "overt rehearsal" The people were told to say their thoughts out loud, This tested test "how" and "when" participants rehearsed each item in a list. In 1977, Brodie and Murdock used overt rehearsal to give an alternate explanation for the primacy effect. They learned that even as people got towards the end of the list, they were still repeating the first terms. This caused the items to still be inthe person's short-term memory (STM) near the end of the list. This created what is called a "recency effect". Brodie and Murdock said that rehearsal is a main cause of the primacy effect. They also believed that the primacy effect may be a type of "recency effect".

The recency effect is the ability to remember items near the end of a list. Unlike the primacy effect, changes in speed and the size of the list do not affect the recency effect. Psychologists have learned that asking people to list the items in the ‘order they were presented’ causes less recency effect. In a 1966 study, Glanzer and Kunitz learned that increasing the time between when the list is presented and when recall is tested can affect the recency effect. With just an added 30 second delay, there was no longer a recency effect. In 1990, researchers tried to distract the people during the test. They would have the person do something that stopped short-term memory (rehearsal). For example, they would have the person countbackward from 3. The results showed that this also removed the recency effect.

The recency effect is normally said to be caused by short-term memory. (STM) The STM of a person can store a small amount of information for a short time. The amount of information is normally two to four items. The last few items of a list being normally still in the STM of a person when the items are being recalled. This theory explains why the recency effect is generally larger than the primacy effect. It takes more effort to get the first items from long-term memory (LTM) than to get the items from STM. This is affected by the STM of the person being affected by a distraction.

Newer research has shown that the recency effect can exist without STM. For instance, Bjork and Whitten showed that even when STM was distracted there can be a long-term recency effect. During their study, they had the people do something to affect their STM during the entire test. These test showed that there was still some recency effect . Some psychologists think that the recency effect is based on a theory of temporal context. Temporal context means "the context of time". Theories in this field are vague and still developing. The general idea is that context is connected to each item on the list. During recall, This contect will help the person remember the item. The later the item in the list, the more similar the context of the item is to context of the test.

Earlier research showed that the serial position effect was connected to single way that memory is stored such as LTM (primacy) and STM (recency). Research on people with brain damage that affected their LTM has showed a recency effect but not a primacy effect. This gives good evidence for this. 

On the other hand, the serial position effect is also supported by dual-store or multi-store models of memory. For instance, research on the serial position effect supports the multi-store model of memory by Atkinson and Shieffrin. Research about the long-term recency effect may show evidence for theories of the working memory model.

Imoinu

Imoinu (Emoinu) () is a goddess in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). She is the goddess of household, hearth, family, fireplace, kitchen, wealth, peace and prosperity. She is frequently associated with Leimarel Sidabi. She is regarded as one of the incarnations or representations of goddess Leimarel Sidabi.

The personality of Emoinu and other goddesses like Panthoibi and Phouoibi depict as well as influence the , courage, independence, and social honour of Meitei women.

The meaning of the name "Emoinu Ahongbi" ("ꯏꯃꯣꯢꯅꯨ ꯑꯍꯣꯡꯕꯤ") can be found by splitting it up word by word. Here, "E" ("ꯏ") refers to human being. "Moi" ("ꯃꯣꯢ" or "ꯃꯣꯏ") refers to . "Nu" ("ꯅꯨ") refers to female deity or goddess. So, "Emoinu" means "goddess who rears the human beings". "Ahongbi" means "giver of plentiful household properties".

Dr. Parratt described Emoinu Ahongbi (alias Emoinu Ahong Achaubi) as another form of Goddess Leimarel Sidabi. Leimarel Sidabi is the supreme mother. Imoinu is regarded as an ever resourceful lady. She always gives wealth and prosperity to the mankind. She was shown as having a human appearance. She resides near the fire hearth. The goddess is believed to be the controller and regulator of good conduct and behavior of the human beings.

Imoinu Ahong Achaubi is a deity for good moral behavior, besides wealth and prosperity. As a social code of conduct, a Meitei woman should go out from home only after prayers and worship of the goddess and other household deities. When she returns home, she should pray to the deity.

The Meitei people believed that goddess Imoinu lives in the houses of those who strictly obey her favorite social and moral behavior norms. Imoinu blesses such people with "nungai yaifaba" (well-being and prosperity), "watta padaba" (having neither shortage nor excess), "tekta kaidaba" (unaffected by troubles of life) and "punshi nungshangba" (long life). These are the basic needs of life in the human world.

After the creation of the sky and the planets, Sidaba () (the Supreme Being) ordered His wife, Leimarel Sidabi () (the first woman) to produce another Leimarel. The second Leimarel would be the second woman. Her responsibility was to take care of the mankind on the planet called earth. Goddess Leimarel Sidabi obeyed her divine husband's order. She created another Leimarel. The appearance of the second Leimarel was similar to the first Leimarel. The first Leimarel named the second Leimarel as ""Emoinu Ahongbi"".
Once goddess Imoinu fell in love with a man. The two became lovers. They swore to be husband and wife. One day, she visited his house in his absence. She discovered that he was already married to another woman. After knowing this, she sacrificed her love. She swore on not to see the man again. She never married to anyone. So, she remained as a virgin goddess.

Imoinu (Emoinu) is a hearth deity. She is annually worshipped on the 12th of the Meitei month of Wakching (December-January interface month). Despite this annual event, she is also worshipped everyday. The daily worship is a part of a Meitei ritual. It is done in every Meitei household with the offering of little cooked rice before eating.
Nowadays, there is little or no households with proper phunga lairu (traditional fire hearth). So, a modern fireplace is developed. Here, traditional rites and rituals are performed in honor of the goddess.

There are a lot of changes in the way of worshipping Goddess Imoinu. However, the essence and the importance always remain the same as forever.

The "Imoinu Iratpa" ("Emoinu Eratpa") is a religious festival dedicated to goddess Imoinu (Emoinu). It is celebrated on the 12th of Wakching month (December-January interface month) every year. Traditionally, worship and prayers are performed inside every households. Nowadays, Imoinu Iratpa festival is also celebrated in a larger way in public gathering clubs also.

Leimarel Sidabi

Leimarel Sidabi () or Leimalel Sitapi () is a goddess in Meitei mythology and religion of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). She is the highest female divinity in Meitei pantheon. She is the goddess of earth, nature and household. She is the mother of everyone in the universe.

The Meitei word "Leimarel" (ꯂꯩꯃꯔꯦꯜ) or "Leimaren" (ꯂꯩꯃꯔꯦꯟ) is as "queen" or "goddess" in English. The word "Leimarel" (or "Leimaren") can be broken into pieces: "Lei" (ꯂꯩ), "Ma" (ꯃ) and "-ren" (-ꯔꯦꯟ) or "-rel" (-ꯔꯦꯜ). "Lei" means land or earth. "Ma" means mother. "-ren" (or "-rel") means excellent. Another Meitei word "Sidabi" can be broken into "Si" (ꯁꯤ), "-da" (ꯗ) and "-bi" (-ꯕꯤ). "Si" ("See") means ""to die"". "-da" denotes negative meaning. "-bi" ("-bee") denotes feminine gender.

Leimarel is the mother goddess. In ancient times, the ruling royal couples sat in the "Laplen Ka" (the central room). They faced the sacred spot of goddess Leimarel. It was believed that men and women originated from Leimarel's womb. A house symbolises the Mother in traditional Meitei beliefs.

The supreme creator Atingkok (alias Salailel) asked his two sons, Sanamahi and Pakhangba to run in a race around the world. The winner would become the ruler of the world. Sanamahi was stronger than his younger brother, Pakhangba. He started his journey. Pakhangba wept to his mother, Leimarel Sidabi. She told him the secret behind the throne of the universe. The secret is that going around the throne of the Supreme Being is shorter than going around the universe. So, Pakhangba went around the Supreme Being, his father. Thus, he won the race and became the ruler of the universe. When Sanamahi returned home, he found his younger brother sitting on the throne. He got angry. He attacked Pakhangba. Pakhangba ran away. He hid himself among seven lairembis. The Supreme Being intervened the situation. He brought peace of Sanamahi. He made Sanamahi as the king of the household of the mankind. At the same time, goddess Leimarel Sidabi became another Imung Lai (household deity), besides Sanamahi.

According to some legends, goddess Ima Leimaren (lit. Mother Leimarel) takes care of the market. She brings peace and harmony by doing so. This tradition is still maintained by womenfolk. The women are considered as the descendents of the "Ima".

Several ancient texts (PuYas) write things about the goddess Leimarel. Some include the Leimaren Naoyom, the Leimaren Langon, the Leimaren Mingkhei, the Leimaren Shekning Lasat, the Leimaren Ungoiron, besides others.

Leimarel Sidabi and her son Sanamahi are worshipped in the first room of every Meitei household. Goddess Leimarel doesn't want the "Korou Anganba" (sunlight) in the morning. So, houses of Loi castes are mainly made facing southwards. She lives in water also. So, she is worshipped in an "Isaiphu" (an earthen pitcher or terracotta pot containing water). There are no images kept to represent the two deities inside their abode.

A senior woman or women of the house fills the earthen pot of the goddess with fresh water. She does this after taking a holy bath. Fresh flowers, fruits, vegetables and rice are offered. Prayers are also offered to protect the family members from every troubles.

The maibas perform rites and rituals by chanting hymns dedicated to goddess Leimaren (ancestral mother goddess). It is generally done inside the house. Water, rice and flowers are mainly placed.

Goddess Leimarel Sidabi and her son Sanamahi are mainly worshipped in many religious occasions. Some are Cheiraoba and "Saroi-Khangba". Cheiraoba is the Meitei new year (Manipuri new year) festival. Saroi-Khangba is a religious event to please the evil spirits.

The "Leimarel Sheisak" is one of the 9 singing styles (tunes) of Meitei tradition (Manipuri culture). It is sung during the festival of Lai Haraoba.
Ima Keithel () is the world's only women run market. It has 3 major complexes. Leimarel Sidabi Ima Keithel is the Complex Number 1 of the market. It is followed by Imoinu Ima Keithel (Complex Number 2) and Phouoibi Ima Keithel (Complex Number 3). This 500 year old market is in the center of Imphal, Manipur.

Irai Leima

Irai Leima () or Ireima () is a goddess in Meitei mythology and religion (Sanamahism) of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). She is the goddess and the divine female personification of water and aquatic life. She is also considered to be the incharge of the diseases.

She is the consort of Irai Ningthou (literally, "king of water"). Both are regarded as the divine spirits of water bodies.

Irai Leima is the daughter of King Heibok Ningthou and the princess of Heibok Ching. Her father was an expert in witchcraft and black magic. Irai Leima is known for her exceptional beauty. One day, she was fishing in the Liwa river. King Kwakpa (Kokpa) of Khuman dynasty saw her and fell in love with her. He proposed her. She replied that her parents' wish will be her wish. So, King Kwakpa consulted his subjects. They presented Heibok Ningthou many presents. King Kwakpa planned to marry Irai Leima if her father agreed or to bring her by force if her father rejected. Seeing the arrogance of Kwakpa, Heibok Ningthou turned all the gifts into stone. At this, followers of Kwakpa fled the place. Kwakpa returned home disappointed.

One day, King Kwakpa got intoxicated after drinking a juice of the roots of Tera plant ("Bambax malabaricum"). He wanted to meet Irai Leima. So, he went to her place riding on a Hiyang boat. Seeing his approach, she fled to Pakhra Ching mountain. Kwakpa chased her. Seeing all these, Heibok Ningthou turned the Hiyang boat into stone and the oar into a tree. Getting angry, Kwakpa ran towards Heibok Ningthou to kill him. Then, Heibok Ningthou turned Khuman Kwakpa into a stone. Irai Leima saw all this and was afraid of her father. She left her father and ran away. She passed the Pakhra Ching, crossed the Liwa river and entered the house of Sarangthem Luwangba. She hid herself inside the granary of the house. When Sarangthem Luwangba and his good lady Thoidingjam Chanu Amurei left the house for field, Irai Leima came out from her hiding place. In the meantime, she completed all the household chores. When the couple returned home, she hid herself again. The couple got surprised at this but it happened everyday. So, one day, the man returned home earlier than usual. He found out the truth. But when he came near Irai Leima, she had disappeared below the granary. He looked under the granary but he saw nothing. He was amazed at this. So, he discussed the issue with all his clan members. They searched everywhere but didn't find her anymore.

Irai Leima appeared in the dream of Sarangthem Luwangba and told him that she was merged into his clan and became his daughter. The matter was reported to King Senbi Kiyaamba of Ningthouja dynasty. The king sent maibas and maibis to examine the case. The examiners said that the mysterious lady was a goddess and she should be worshipped. King Kiyaamba also told Luwangba to do so. From that year onwards, Irai Leima was worshipped as a goddess.

The day on which Luwangba first saw Irai Leima was the first Monday of the Meitei lunar month of "Lamta (Lamda)". And the day on which the maibas and maibis came was the first Tuesday of "Lamta (Lamda)". Still today, from the time of King Senbi Kiyaamba (1467-1508 AD), the Sarangthem family members annually hold a grand feast ("Chaklen Katpa") in honor of the goddess. Later, Irai Leima came to be known as Hiyangthang Lairembi.

When a person gets ill after bathing in a spring, pool, stream, people believed that the water spirits (Irai Leima and Irai Ningthou) had caught the person. To get well again, people worship the two deities. For this, the maibas perform the rites and rituals. The offerings include 2 eggs and 7 bamboo vessels filled up with rice paste.
The also highly respect the deities. They offer many wild sacrifices. The sacrifices maybe a white fowl, a pig, a dog or a he-goat.

Irai Leima ("Ireima") is considered as one of the divine manifestations of Leimarel (Leimaren), the supreme mother earth goddess. She is also described as a form of goddess Imoinu.

Irai Leima is also known as Hiyangthang Lairembi. During the reign of King Garib Niwaj (alias "Pamheiba"), goddess Hiyangthang Lairembi was converted to Hindu goddess Kamakhya (a form of Durga). The 3rd day of Durga Puja is observed as the "Bor Numit" (literally, Boon Day).



Panthoibi

Panthoibi () or Panthoipi () is a goddess in the Meitei mythology and religion. People in Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur) worshipped her. She is the goddess of civilization, courage, having children, making things with hands, love, winning, war and wisdom. She is married to Nongpok Ningthou.

Col. John Shakespear wrote that Panthoibi is the most famous goddess in the Meitei religion.

People talk about Panthoibi with another goddess, Leimarel Sidabi. Sometimes people think of Panthoibi and Leimarel as the same goddess.
People say Panthoibi is bold, brave, and independent. She always works for what is good and right for Meitei women.

The Meitei word "Panthoibi" (ꯄꯥꯟꯊꯣꯢꯕꯤ or ꯄꯥꯟꯊꯣꯏꯕꯤ) comes from three words, "Pan" (ꯄꯥꯟ), "Thoi" (ꯊꯣꯢ or ꯊꯣꯏ) and "Bi" (ꯕꯤ).

"Pan" (ꯄꯥꯟ) means "to rule over something".

"Thoi" (ꯊꯣꯢ or ꯊꯣꯏ) means "to ", or "to ", or "to ", or "to ", or "to ".

In Meitei language, "Bi" ("Bee") (ꯕꯤ) or "Pi" ("Pee") (ꯄꯤ) means that the rest of the word has a feminine gender. For example, Thoibi is a name given to girls. It has "Thoi" and "Bi".

The word "Thoibi" (ꯊꯣꯢꯕꯤ or ꯊꯣꯏꯕꯤ) also means or beautiful and .

People began to worship Panthoibi when the Khaba dynasty ruled the Kangla. According to the National Archives of India, the "Panthoibi Naheiron" was written before Common Era. It has Meitei language worship songs in it.

The Loyumba Shinyen text, from 1100 c.e., says the Heishnam clan worshipped Panthoibi.

The Cheitharol Kumbaba says people built the first temple to Panthoibi in 1686, and a statue in 1699.

In the 18th century, fewer people worshipped Panthoibi. This because the religion Vaishnavism became common in Manipur. Hindu King Garib Niwaj Pamheiba (1709-1748) pulled down the temples to Panthoibi. He broke the statues of her. Her last temple was built in 1700. After that, people did not build new temples until modern times.

Starting in the 18th century, people said the Meitei goddess Panthoibi was the same goddess as the Hindu goddess Durga. People worshipped her for five days in September or October.

In the 1960s, some people started to worship Panthoibi instead of Durga.

Panthoibi is proud of being female. Legend says she can change shape and has different bodies. For example, she can be Phouoibi, the goddess of grain. 
Panthoibi rules birth and death. 
According to the Anoirol text, the goddess Panthoibi is also "Khabi Lengnao Mombi". Khabi Lengnao Mombi is the ancient amaibi (lit. "priestess"). Different texts say different things about Panthoibi. Panthoibi was regarded as a pre-historical Maibi. Some texts say she is the goddess Nongthang Leima, another goddess amaibi.

Panthoibi is a ruling deity of the "Kang" game. Kang is an indoor Meitei tradition game that people in Manipur played. Kang players pray to Panthoibi before and during the game. People believe that good players need her blessing.

Goddess Panthoibi is the goddess of all . She taught the women of Manipur to make pots. She was taught the art of pottery by goddess Leimarel Sidabi before her disappearance. She has another mythology about this.

Goddess Panthoibi is part of the legend of "Haoreibi Shampubi" (alias "Haoreima"). Haoreibi Shampubi is a woman from the hills. She was killed when she went meet her lover. She turned into a ghost. People say she is an incarnation of Panthoibi. People started to think of Panthoibi as a goddess of death and fertility.
When humans do bad things, Panthoibi does too. If a person has spit near Panthoibi's shrine, he or she will not be able to turn his or her neck. It could be healed only by a maiba. For this, the maiba will perform a ritual.
Goddess Panthoibi saw a spider. It was making in a corner. So Panthoibi learned to spin thread and weave cloth.
Panthoibi imitated the pattern of weaving of the spider. Later, she introduced the art of weaving.
In another legend, the goddess Leishambi taught Panthoibi to weave.

Panthoibi was very beautiful. She was a daughter of a Meitei king. Many kings and princes wanted to marry her. King Shapaiba () was one of them. He promised her he would build good roads, beautiful bridges, a big house and fish ponds. But she did not agree to marry him. Finally, Panthoibi married Tarang Khoinucha (alias Taram Khoinucha). He was the son of King Khaba Sokchrongba and Queen Teknga of the Khaba dynasty. Her marriage ceremony was wonderful. 
Panthoibi first met Nongpok Ningthou (alias Angoupa Kainou Chingsangsompa) five days after her wedding. She was walking in the grass and swimming in a river. She liked his handsome looks and personality. They fell in love. Nongpok Ningthou asked her to run away from her husband and marry him. But she did not say yes then. She told him to wait.

Panthoibi and Nongpok Ningthou secretly met many times. Panthoibi's husband's parents started to think something was wrong. Tarang Khoinucha tried to win her heart many times. Panthoibi and Nongpok Ningthou ran away together. They wore clothes as disguises.

Panthoibi and Nongpok Ningthou married on the sunny side of the Nongmaiching Hills. The gods celebrated with dancing and music (by the "Langmai people" and not the "gods" in another version). This celebration was the start of the Lai Haraoba festival.

In another way of telling the story, Panthoibi first met Nongpok Ningthou when she was helping her father at farming. The two fell in love before they had talked. But Panthoibi got married to another man even though she did not want to. Later, she left her husband's house to search for Nongpok Ningthou. Nongpok Ningthou also left his home to look for Panthoibi. The two met at the Kangla. Kangla became the place of their divine union. This is why Meitei kings do their crowning ceremony there.

According to the Numit Kappa text (c. 1st century), in ancient times, there were two suns in the sky. An archer hero ("many men" in some version) shot one of the suns with an arrow and hurt it. The two brother suns ran away out of the sky. They hid for ten long days. The world was dark. No men could work. Crops and cows died. Then the ten godly kings (or "kingly gods") talked to the other gods. They asked each to talk to the Sun God. None succeeded. Finally, the ten gods came to Princess Panthoibi. She showed them magical ceremonies to get the Sun God to come back. The unhurt Sun God came back, but the archer hit with the arrow did not.

Panthoibi saw a spider. It was making good, thin thread. It was also making a web. From this, she started weaving. The god of weaving is female because women were the ones who wove cloth.

After the first human beings, Panthoibi made them a place to live. Humans started eating and drinking. Panthoibi realised they needed someplace to put food and water. So she started making pots. In the beginning, she did not know how to make a pot. Later, she looked around. She saw a flower - "Nura Khudonglei" (""). She saw its shape. Then, she made a pot. Since then, humans could make pots for cooking food and drinking water.

Panthoibi is mainly worshipped by the Heisnam family of Meitei ethnicity. So, she is also known as "Heisnam Lairembi" (lit. Lairembi of the Heisnam).

Panthoibi is regarded as one of the divine incarnations of Goddess Leimarel Sidabi. She is also regarded as an incarnation of goddess Nongthang Leima. She also has many forms including Phouoibi (goddess of grains). Goddess "Haoreibi Shampubi" (alias "Haoreima") is also regarded as an incarnation of Panthoibi.

"Panthoibi Iratpa" ("Panthoibi Eratpa") is a religious festival dedicated to goddess Panthoipi. It is celebrated every year.

The Lai Haraoba festival is about Panthoibi and Nongpok Ningthou. There are legends and writings about them in Ancient Manipur.

"Panthoibi Jagoi" is a dance form in which two people dnace together while a maibi and a "Pena Khongba" (pena player) play a love song about Panthoibi and Nongpok Ningthou. It also depicts the process of weaving.

"Panthoibi Sheishak" is a song in the Lai Haraoba festival. pena players play the song. It is about Panthoibi searching for Nongpok Ningthou.

It is one of the nine singing ways of singing in the Lai Haraoba.

"Tangkhul Nurabi Loutaba" is play about what Tangkhul Pakhang (an incarnation of Nongpok Ningthou) and Tangkhul Nurabi (an incarnation of Panthoibi) said to each other. The two players wear costumes of farming in the field. The play is on the last night of the Kanglei Haraoba (one of the 4 forms of Lai Haraoba festival).

The "Panthoibi Emporium" is a place for buying and selling things in New Delhi, India.
The "Panthoibi Housing Finance Company Limited" is a housing financial company. Its office is near Flyover bridge in Uripok Tourangbam Leikai in Imphal.
The "Panthoibi Manipur Handicrafts Emporium" is a place in Delhi, India. It stores handmade by-products made of silk from Manipur.

Nongthang Leima

Nongthang Leima () is the goddess of seduction, thunder and lightning in Meitei mythology and religion. She was created by Atingkok (or Salailen) to attract Haraba (Pakhangba).
She mastered thunder and lightning in the chaos in the early world. She predicted the first rain. 
She limits the chaos and helps creation.

The female first name "Nongthang Leima" (ꯅꯣꯡꯊꯥꯡ ꯂꯩꯃ) is made up of two Meitei language words, "Nongthang" (ꯅꯣꯡꯊꯥꯡ, /noŋ.tʰáŋ/) and "Leima" (ꯂꯩꯃ, /lə́i.ma/). In Meitei language (Manipuri language), "Nongthang" (ꯅꯣꯡꯊꯥꯡ, /noŋ.tʰáŋ/) means lightning. The word "Nongthang" (ꯅꯣꯡꯊꯥꯡ, /noŋ.tʰáŋ/) itself is also made up of two words, "Nong" (ꯅꯣꯡ, /noŋ/) and "Thāng" (ꯊꯥꯡ, /tʰáŋ/). "Nong" (ꯅꯣꯡ, /noŋ/) means rain and "Thāng" (ꯊꯥꯡ, /tʰáŋ/) means sword.
In Meitei language (Manipuri language), "Leima" (ꯂꯩꯃ, /lə́i.ma/) means queen. The word "Leima" (ꯂꯩꯃ, /lə́i.ma/) itself is made up of two words "Lei" (ꯂꯩ, /lə́i/) and "Ma" (ꯃ, /ma/). "Lei" (ꯂꯩ, /lə́i/) means land and "Ma" (ꯃ, /ma/) means mother.

Nongthang Leima is a pre-historical maibi. She is the first goddess maibi to compose a dance form. Later, her dance form was reposessed by other goddesses.

Sanamahi (Ashiba) was creating the earth. But he was frequently disturbed by his younger brother, Pakhangba (Haraba). Unable to do any work, Sanamahi complained about the matter to their father, Salailen (or Atingkok according to different versions of stories). Salailen produced a divine feminine being. He released her into the great space (void) of the universe (cosmos). In the vast emptiness of the great space (void), the divine feminine being became a beautiful and radiant goddess. She was named "Nongthang Leima", the Queen of Lightning.

In another version of the story, Sidaba ordered Sidabi to produce "Nongthang Leima", the divine female being to lure the destroyer from the cosmic creation.

Nongthang Leima, the Queen of Lightning, filled the empty space (void) with bright light. Seeing her, Pakhangba (Haraba) fell in love with her. He forgot about bothering his elder brother in the creation of the earth. Haraba came to her in the great space. During that time, Sanamahi (Ashiba) completed his creation of the earth.

When Ashiba (Sanamahi) saw Nongthang Leima, he wanted to marry her. Thus, they united. 
So, Nongthang Leima was the wife of both Sanamahi (Ashiba) and Pakhangba (Haraba).
Nongthang Leima is also known as "Langmai Sana Chingjaroibi" (). With the union of Chingjaroibi and Sanamahi, a son named Laisang Khekwaiba was born.

According to "Politics, society, and cosmology in India's North East" written by N. Vijaylakshmi, the goddess Nongthang Leima (Nongthang Lairembi) took two divine forms after the completion of the creation of the earth. One form is Panthoibi. This form lives in the home of gods. Another form is "Apanthoibi". This form lives among the living beings.
Among the nine forms of musical rhythms ("Seisak"s) of Pena (musical instrument), Nongthang Leima Seisak is one. All these rhythms are categorised into three movements, slow rhythm, medium rhythm and fast rhythm. Nongthang Leima song belongs to the fast rhythm.

During the Lai Haraoba festival, devotees dance to please various deities. Among them, male dancers act after the styles of Haraba (alias Pakhangba) and female dancers act after the styles of goddess Nongthang Leima. Goddess Nongthang Leima represents the lightning.

Goddess Nongthang Leima is often identified as Leimarel Sidabi. The former is considered as an incarnation of the latter.

Peak-end rule

The peak-end rule is a psychological term proposed by and Daniel Kahneman. It suggests the following: When evaluating an experience, people do not recall details in every moment they experienced. People mainly recall what happened and how they felt at the peak and the end of the event. The peak is the time when they had the strongest emotion. Our feelings at the peak and the end of the event decide what people generally feel about an experience. The feelings at the peak and the end take up similar weights, which means the memory of the experience is the average of the two.

The peak-end rule is a form of . When evaluating past experiences, people concentrate on the peak and the end while other parts of the experience are neglected. How long they have had the experience, is neglected.

According to peak-end rule, humans use false memories to form preferences and make decisions. Thus, decisions are very unlikely to lead to the best outcome they want. By contrast, the standard economics suggests that humans can always choose something that serves them the best, producing the largest net pleasantness. The establishment of the theory is evidence against the rational choice theory.

The peak–end rule was first established by Daniel Kahneman and others in 1993. In the experiment, participants were divided into two groups. They had to undergo an unpleasant experience. Everything else was the same, except for one group who had to go through an extra, less unpleasant experience at the end. Let us call this group Group B and previous group Group A.

The researchers concluded that the most unpleasant, the peak, and the final intensity of unpleasantness, the end were used to evaluate the procedure. In this case, the end of Group B is less unpleasant. At the same time, the peak of both Group A and Group B were the same. Thus, the sum of the unpleasantness of the peak and the end was less for Group B. As a result, participants from Group B found the experience less unpleasant, although for both the duration of and the sum of unpleasantness, Group A < Group B.

The peak-end rule is a type of . The peak and the end simplify and represent the whole experience. It reduces people's and helps people make quick decisions.From an evolutionary point of view, emotion related memories help us survive, keep us safe. For example, fear related memories help us recognize and better deal with dangerous situations.

When memory sticks, it lasts longer and can be recalled easier. Memories associated with strong emotions stick. Experiments were done to prove strong emotion-related things are recalled more often. An experiment done by found a biological explanation for this. 

Why our memory prefers what happened at the end can be explained by the recency effect. suggests that we consider recent events to be more important. What happens at the end of an experience is more recent to us. Thus, we consider the things that happen at the end of an experience to be more important. The end is more memorable than other parts.

Adding a positive peak can establish a good memory of an experience even though there may be unimportant unpleasant moments in between. This technique has been applied to many fields, for example, the business field. When customers are leaving, salesmen help the customer hold the door. This act leaves a good final and overall impression. Another example is in the educational field. To make receiving negative feedback more acceptable, ending with the most pleasant part of the feedback will help.

People's memories of an experience influence their decision making. Adding a good end encourages people to experience the event a second time. Some medical procedures are too painful for the patients to repeat. Adding something positive at the end creates a more positive impression of the experience. After doing so, there is a smaller probability the patient is unwilling to receive the treatment a second time. Then, patients can more effectively recover with a less total cost and shorter time.

Inversely, a negative end ruins the memory of an experience even though everything before was perfect.If a person wants themselves or other people to do something less, adding a negative end to the experience helps.

People's memories of their experiences are not what they experienced. So, relying on our memories to make decisions does not lead to the highest net pleasure. To experience the net largest amount of pleasure, people should spend as much time as possible on things that they are unwilling to stop doing.

Studies found that other factors influence the peak-end rule. Firstly, the expectation. A high expectation is compared with the actual experience at the start. If a difference exists, the starting experience will be the most important factor in overall experience evaluation. The peak-end rule is more likely to be applicable to lower expectation situations. Secondly, one study finds that the effect of peak-end law is small on one day experiences. Moreover, some people are easily affected by the rule but others are not. Thirdly, according to and Carmon, how we feel at the moment of evaluation also affects the outcome.

Loss aversion

Loss aversion is a concept in psychology. It is to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. The principle is prominent in economics.

The principle of loss aversion was first proposed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979. Loss aversion happens when people face the same amount of gains and losses and find the loss is more unbearable. In other words, the pain of loss is greater than the pleasure of equal gain. In some experiments females have a higher level of loss aversion than males. 

The cause of loss aversion lies in people's asymmetric emotional response to gain and loss. This is particularly strong during the anticipation processing and the immediate experience after presenting the outcome. One study of income and well-being indicates that when people make loss-averse choices, it is not directly due to the loss itself but because the impact brings a series of negative consequences that follow the loss.A classic example presented in the book "Thinking, Fast and Slow" of a flipping coin implies that people will first compare the satisfaction of gaining with the pain of losing before making a decision. Thus, most people would not choose to participate in coin gambling with 50% to get $150 and 50% to lose $100; and according to the "loss aversion ratio," the minimum amount to fulfil the pain of losing $100 will be $200.

In 2001, J. O' Doherty and his colleagues found that humans process losses and gains in qualitatively different ways by using brain imaging technology. There is a correlation between the magnitude of brain activation and the extent of reward and losses.When we are evaluating potential gains, the areas of the brain that process value and reward become more active than it does when assessing the potential losses. The different loss aversion levels differ from individuals by the degrees of sensitivity to losses and gains.

Equity premium puzzle is the problem of why there is a big difference between returns in stocks and risk-free investments. Stocks are much riskier than government bonds. The underinvestment in stocks relative to bonds supports the idea of loss aversion theory. The myopic loss aversion introduced by Shlomo Benartzi and Richard Thaler indicates the behavioural characteristics of "loss aversion" and "frequent evaluations" of investors. They argue that loss-averse investors are more willing to take risks if they do not evaluate the performance of their investments frequently. In their model, investors are unwilling to accept return variability and tend to take a short-term view of their wealth.

Demand is more elastic for price increases than price decreases, based on the assumption that the price increase is a loss while the price decrease is a gain for consumers.
Based on the principle of loss aversion, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Twersky developed prospect theory to explain how consumers make decisions in uncertain situations. Unlike the hypothesis of rational man used in economics, prospect theory reveals the irrational psychological factors that affect the choice behaviour. Most people are unwilling to take risks when facing gains but become risk-seeking in losses.

Loss aversion theory explains the endowment effect. The endowment effect refers to the finding that once an individual owns something, he/she tends to naturally place more value than he did before he didn't own it. Due to the asymmetric responses to losses and gains in the decision-making process, the consideration of "loss avoidance" is far greater than that of "gain seeking".

By using the loss aversion theory as a marketing strategy, businesses can gain higher profits by changing consumers' behaviours. For example:






RTÉ One

RTÉ One () is a television channel in Ireland. It is the main TV channel of Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ). It is the most popular channel in Ireland. It started in 31 December 1961 and was called "Telefís Éireann". It was the first TV channel in Ireland. It was called "RTÉ" from 1966, and "RTÉ 1" from 1978 when RTÉ 2 started. The channel was only in black and white between 1961 and 1968. From 1968, some programmes were broadcast in PAL colour.

Some of the money for the channel comes from a government television licence, and the rest comes from advertisements. RTÉ channels have fewer advertisements than other channels because of this. RTÉ One can be watched by 98% of people in Ireland in HD on the Saorview digital service. It can also be watched on Freeview, Sky, Virgin Media, and online through RTÉ Player.

Pelton wheel

The pelton wheel is a kind of water turbine. It is used in power plants, to convert a water flow into a movement of a wheel (and then into energy). Lester Alan Pelton invented it in the 1870s. In a regular wheel for example of a mill, the energy is obtained from the weight of the water. A pelton wheel uses the impulse of the water to generate energy, not its weight. Pelton wheels are used in power plants where there's a big difference in height, but where there is relatively little water. An example might be a dam or barrage in the mountains. One of the drawbacks of a pelton wheel is the relatively hight level of wear: Unlike the Francis turbine, a pelton wheel cannot be used to pump water.
