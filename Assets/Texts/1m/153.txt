Her birth name was believed to be Aicha. Her family was chased out of Granada to Morocco during the Spanish Reconquista. She and her family then settled in Tetouán. Her first husband was the Sultan Al-Mandri. She had herself immediately named governer of Tetouán, after he died. She was bestowed the title Al-Hurra. This was a symbol of respect and power. She then married the King of Morocco. This was the only time in Islamic history a king traveled outside his country for his wedding. Spain and Portugal were worried about this. It seemed like a threat, as this alliance would be extremely strong. Iberians attacked Al-Hurra’s land. She became a pirate to defend her country and stop them. She made an alliance with the dreaded pirate Barabarossa, or Red Beard. He used his fleet to ferry refugees away from the fighting. Al-Hurra terrorized Spanish and Portuguese ships. She became known and feared across the Mediterranean. She was known for taking hostages and being extremely merciless. The Spanish feared her and prayed for a miracle. The Portuguese “prayed for God to allow them to see her hanged from a ship’s mast”. She was categorized as aggressive and bad-tempered. Al-Hurra became one of the richer pirates of her time. She still managed to maintain a consistent alliance with Red Beard. Her demise came after over 30 years of sailing. Her son-in-law usurped her power and throne. He also stole her wealth. She lived in her childhood home in Morocco until her death. She died at age 75. Sayyida Al-Hurra’s legacy lives on today. In European writing she is known as the fearsome Pirate Queen of the Mediterranean.

The rhyme was first collected in Britain in the late 1940s. Since teddy bears were not common before the twentieth century it is likely fairly recent in its current form. Iona and Peter Opie suggest that it is probably a version of an older rhyme, "Round about there":

Plectrohyla teuchestes

The Alta Verapaz spikethumb frog ("Plectrohyla teuchestes") is a frog that lives in Guatemala. Scientists have only seen it in one place. It was in the Sierra de Xucaneb in eastern Guatemala at 1000 meters above sea level.

Cinderella effect

Cinderella effect is the name for a phenomenon found in psychology: Child abuse and mistreatment is more common in families with stepparents. 

It is named after the fairy tale Cinderella, where a girl gets mistreated by her stepsisters and stepmother. Psychologists think this shows a bias towards kin. A person has fewer incentives to invest in a child that is not his or her direct offspring. 

P.D. Scott first used the term Cinderella effect, in a study he did in 1973: He studied 29 cases of babies who were beaten to death in anger; he found that in 15 cases, the baby's stepfather was the killer.

Clara Cannucciari

Clara Cannucciari (née Bonfanti; August 18, 1915 – November 29, 2013) hosted the web series "Great Depression Cooking with Clara" and wrote the book "Clara's Kitchen".

Clara was born in Melrose Park, Illinois on August 18, 1915 to Giuseppe and Giuseppina Bonfanti, who recently moved from Sicily. The family had a bad life during the Great Depression, but ended up safe and healthy because Giuseppina made their meals last longer.

In 2007, her grandson Christopher started making the web series "Great Depression Cooking with Clara", in which she made those meals. She retired shortly after her 96th birthday. Their last video, Fried Fish, was posted on April 18, 2019. On March 25, 2020, Christopher said he would start uploading more videos of Clara.

Clara died on November 29, 2013 at 98 years old. Her daughter-in-law, four grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren were still alive.

City block

A city block is a block of houses, in a built up area. Usually, it is delimited by roads, pathways, or by geographical features, such as a railway line or a river. It consists of several land lots which are directly next to each other, and usually privately owned. 

A city block is a typical form of inner-city design. Commonly, multi-storey apartment buildings, semi-detatched houses, office blocks, or mixed-use houses make up the elements of a city block. As all the houses touch each other, this is known as a closed form.

In the suburbs, there is more space, and the buildings don't usually touch each other. This is known as an open form.

In Europe, cities have grown over centuries, and their layout is different from that of a planned city. As a result, the city block in a planned city also looks different.

The design of city blocks started with the emergence of cities, in the Middle Ages. Medieval Hanseatic cities already used city blocks. The design can also be found in baroque inner cities, such as the Dutch Quarter in Potsdam. It is typical of absolutist urban development and the tenement districts of major German cities that were built after 1870 during the Wilhelminian era. In response to the housing shortage of the 1920s, housing associations built apartment blocks with large courtyards and small apartments. At the same time, however, city planners were also looking for alternatives to the perimeter block development that was common at the time. What they did was build blocks perpendicular to the road; they would then build footpaths as access. This has the benefit that all apartments get the same amount of sunshine. It has the drawback, that larger arrangements look monontonus.This kind of city planning was widespread during the reconstruction of Germany after the Second World War, in the 1950s and 1960s. Another benefit of this model is that neighborhoods have a better airflow.

During the Middle Ages, city blocks were often simply chaining buildings, in an unplanned way.

Even in antiquity , there were planned cities. Examples of this are the city of Miletus, or the model of a Roman city, which both used a regular grid layout. During the Baroque era, citty planning was common: Cities were planned with big geometric layouts, later they were divided into different land lots, before being built.

City blocks are also used for collecting statistical data on the population structure . When visualizing 3D city models, people oftenuse simplified solid bodies that are supposed to correspond to "the real building blocks."

Poeciliidae

The Poeciliidae are a family of fish of the order Cyprinodontiformes, the tooth-carps. They live in fresh water. Many live-bearing aquarium fish, such as the guppy, molly, platy, and swordtail are in Poeciliidae. These fish are from the United States to north of Río de la Plata, Argentina, and Africa, including Madagascar. Human beings took these fish to many other parts of the world and set them free there, so they have become invasive species. Today, poeciliid fish live in all tropical and subtropical parts of planet Earth. People have seen fish in the genuses "Poecilia" and "Gambusia" in hot spring pools as far north as Banff, Alberta in Canada.

Although all fish in Poeciliidae are called "live bearers" (viviparous), some species do lay eggs with external fertilization. All African fish in Poeciliidae lay eggs. Almost all the American Poeciliidae bear live young (except for fish in the genus "Tomeurus").

Poeciliidae has three subfamilies. The fish in subfamily Aplocheilichthyinae live only in Africa. Most Poeciliinae live in the Americas (except for "Rhexipanchax", which lives in Africa). Most fish in Procatopodinae live in Africa ("Fluviphylax" and "Pseudopoecilia" live in South America). Scientists say this means the ancestors of Poeciliidae fish the split between Africa and South America 100 million years ago, and that fish that went to South America evolved to bear live young after they got there. Poeciliids came to North America through the Antilles. They were able to do this because the Antilles and North America were connected 44 million years ago. Poeciliids then moved to Central America by the Aves land bridge on the Caribbean Plate. When South America connected to Central America three million years ago, some of the fish moved further south, but South American species did not move north into Central America.

The live-bearing species fish can be different from each other depending on how much the mother fish does for the developing larvae. Many fish in the family Poeciliidae are lecithotrophic (the mother provisions the oocyte with all the resources it needs prior to fertilization, so the egg is independent of the mother), but others are matrotrophic ("mother feeding": the mother provides the majority of resources to the developing offspring after fertilization). Lecithotrophy and matrotrophy are not always completely separate. Most scientific studies use a matrotrophy index (MI) to say how matrotrophic an animal is. This uses the dry mass of fully developed offspring (how much they weigh when they are not wet) divided by the dry mass of a fertilized egg.

Fish in the genus "Poeciliopsis", for example, have many different adaptations. "Poeciliopsis monacha", "P. lucida", and "P. prolifica" are part of the same group in that genus. However, they have three different ways of helping baby fish: "P. monacha" is lecithotrophic because it does not give its babies any resources after fertilization. The mother fish swims around with her eggs in a sac but that is all. "P. lucida" shows a middle level of matrotrophy. This means that the eggs's metabolism can change the mother's metabolism, so some food chemicals go back and forth. "P. prolifica" is very matrotrophic. The mother fish gives the eggs almost all of the food chemicals they need after fertilization. This level of matrotrophy allows "Poeciliopsis" to carry several groups of eggs that were start at different times. This is called superfetation.

Because the mother fish only has so much space in her body for developing embryos, viviparity reduces brood size. Superfetation can compensate for this loss by keeping embryos at various stages and sizes during development.

"P. elongata", "P. turneri", and "P. presidionis" form an outgroup to the "P. monacha", "P.lucida", and "P. prolifica" group. These three fish are very matrotrophic. In 1947, C. L. Turner said the follicular cells of "P. turneri" were "pseudo-placenta, pseudo-chorion, and pseudo-allantois." The greater degree of matrotrophy in a species is linked with a higher degree of placentation, including "a thicker maternal follicle, higher degree of vascularization, and greater number of villi in the placenta."

Scientists argue about why Poeciliid fish developed to give their young eggs food chemicals inside their bodies. There are two groups of ideas, adaptive hypotheses and conflict hypotheses. Adaptive ideas, including the locomotor hypothesis, Trexler-DeAngelis Model (reproductive allotment), and life-history facilitation, say that the fish's placenta evolved to help another advantage to evolve. The conflict hypothesis says the placenta is a nonadaptive byproduct of genetic tug-of-war between the mother and the eggs. 
The family has the following subfamilies and tribes:



David Stewart, Duke of Rothesay

David Stewart (1378-1402) was a Scottish politician who made himself unpopular in the late 1390s, and was imprisoned in Falkland Palace in early 1402 and died that year under mysterious circumstances.

Ferengi

The Ferengi are a fictional group of space people on "Star Trek". They first appeared in "" in 1987. They are also in "" and "".

The Ferengi are shorter than humans. They have bald heads, large ears and small teeth. They have noses with deep ridges in them. Most Ferengi are played by short actors in heavy makeup.

Many male Ferengi characters wear colorful clothes and some have hats that cover the backs of their heads but not the tops of their heads.

The Ferengi have a very Capitalist culture. Ferengi think greed is good. In the Ferengi culture, men are supposed to gain wealth. There is a saying: "A Ferengi without profit is no Ferengi at all." Money, payment, and contracts are a big part of life. For example, a guest in a house can be charged admission.

The Ferengi home planet is called Ferenginar. The capital city has a Tower of Commerce that holds the leader's office. The leader of the Ferengi is called the Grand Nagus. The Ferengi call themselves "The Ferengi Alliance," not "Empire" or "Federation."

Ferengi culture is very male-dominated. Women are not supposed to wear clothes or appear in public. During the "Deep Space Nine" run, a Ferengi feminist named Ishka becomes the Grand Nagus's chief financial advisor. She helps Ferengi women gain more rights.

In the "Deep Space Nine" episode "Little Green Men," three characters talk about the Ferengi afterlife. It has reincarnation. Ferengi believe that if they have lived well, they will bid on new lives, like in an auction. If they have lived badly, they will go to the Vault of Eternal Destitution.

Ferengi characters on "Star Trek" often say the Rules of Acquisition. They are similar to proverbs. They are about how to get (acquire) wealth. Some of the Rules are "War is good for business," "Peace is good for business," "Never have sex with the boss' sister," and "Greed is eternal." There are 285 Rules of Acquisition.

The word "Ferengi" comes from the Persian word for "foreigner," usually a Westerner. The "Star Trek" writers wanted a race of people they could use to tell stories about capitalism and 20th and 21st century Western culture.

The first idea for the Ferengi was that they would be the main enemy aliens in "Star Trek: The Next Generation", but they were not scary enough. After that, the writers used the Ferengi for comic relief, to tell the funny parts of their stories.

Some critics have said the Ferengi are too much like stereotypes of Jews.

There are five very important Ferengi characters in Star Trek, and all of them appear in "Deep Space Nine":

Amy Chu

Amy Chu is a Chinese American comic writer. She started comic writing at 45 after a surprising career path. The comic industry was mostly men when Chu started. But, she has shown that women can be successful in comics too. Chu has worked for DC and Marvel. She is a role model in many ways.

Amy Chu was born in Iowa. She is Chinese American. She was one of the only Asian kids in town. Because of this, she didn’t feel like she belonged. She was never interested in comics. Her dream growing up was to be a physicist. In interviews, she says she was very nerdy. Chu was on the chess team and the math team. She wanted to play on the soccer team, too. However, Chu’s school did not have a team for girls. They also would not let her play on the boys’ team. So, her parents sued and won. But even though she was finally on the soccer team, other teams would not play with her.

Chu lives in Princeton, New Jersey now. She is a mother of two children. They play soccer. She likes to shop, play video games, and have fun with Legos. She also enjoys drinking coffee and whiskey.

Chu was part of a joint program with MIT and Wellesley. She was one of the only women doing it. She got a degree in Architecture. She also got a degree in East Asian Studies. Later on in her life, Chu went to Harvard Business School. Years later, she took a course in creative/comic writing.

Chu did graphic design jobs in college. Later, she took on consulting jobs. She even had a job in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong she worked at the Macau tourism office. Pansy Ho was her boss. Chu went back to America to go to business school. She then was a real consultant. She worked for biotech companies. Chu reunited with Georgia Lee. Lee was an old friend of Chu. She also graduated from Harvard. Lee made films. She also wrote scripts for television. Lee asked for Chu’s help. She wanted to start a company. Lee wanted to encourage girls to be interested in comics. Comics are often just for boys. The company would change that. Chu agreed. They co-founded Alpha Girls Comics together. Chu decided to take a class in comic writing. She was the only female taking the class. It did not feel like she was welcome. But, people loved the stories she wrote. Soon Chu became a professional comic book writer. She went on to work for big name companies like DC and Marvel.

Maude Abbott

Maude Elizabeth Seymour Abbott (March 18, 1869-1940) was a Canadian pediatrician and cardiologist. Abbott was one of the first experts in congenital heart disease. Many people considered her the top expert in the world during her lifetime. She studied and documented the hearts from cyanotic patients. Abbott developed the international classification system for congenital heart disease. She recorded it in her "Atlas of Congenital Heart Disease". Her work made it possible for medical researchers to start treating heart disease in the later Twentieth century.

Maude Abbott was born in St. Andrews East, Quebec. She was abandoned by her father at a young age. Her mother died from tuberculosis when she was young. Maude Abbott and her sister, Alice, were adopted by her 62 year old grandmother.

Maude Abbott got a Bachelor of Arts at McGill University. She graduated in 1890. She was one of the first women to get a Bachelor of Arts at McGill University. 

Abbott wanted to be a doctor. McGill would not let women into the medical school. Abbott ran a public campaign trying to be allowed to study there. She wrote letters to the faculty. The school would not let her in. 

So Abbott went to Bishop’s College for medical school. She was the only woman at the school. Both students and teachers there were angry to have a woman studying medicine. Many people there were mean to her and made her studies very difficult. She worked hard anyway. She won the senior anatomy award and her excellent work earned her the chancellor's prize. She graduated in 1894.

After she graduated college, she went to London and Vienna for two years to study. Many colleagues and teachers thought she did good work. She dreamed of teaching at McGill.

Abbott returned to Canada to work at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal. She started researching cardiology. Dr. George Adami, the Chair of Pathology at McGill University was very impressed with her work. He made her the Assistant Curator of the McGill Medical Museum. Three years later, in 1901, she became the full curator of the museum. The museum was a collection of anatomical samples, which means it was body parts from people who had died. The collection was very messy, so Abbott organized it. Her idea was that she would group all the body parts by where they came from in the human body. She would then research each sample and collect all the information she could about it. She would have experts in certain areas of study give more information about the problem each sample encountered. Then, people could study all of the body parts, compare them, and learn more about how the body worked. 

This organizational system was very strong. In fact, she learned so much from comparing different human hearts in the collection that she advanced medical science's understanding of the heart a lot. She first wrote a chapter on congenital heart disease for the book "Principles and Practice of Medicine", edited by William Osler. Then she wrote the "Atlas of Congenital Heart Disease," a major reference work on the human heart. The American Heart Association published it in 1936, with new editions in 1956 and 2006. This book helped medical scientists understand congenital cardiac problems. It led to treatments for these problems in the second half of the Twentieth century. Abbott was planning a textbook to add to the "Atlas". She died before she could write it.

The museum was important for other reasons. Students started coming to look at the collection and learn from Abbott. They found it so useful that they praised her work to the medical school. The school started sending classes to visit, and soon all students were required to go to the museum one day a week for lessons with Abbott.

In 1906, Abbott helped found the International Association of Medical Museums. It still exists today. It is called the International Academy of Pathology.

Starting in 1919, Abbott was the editor of the "Canadian Medical Association Journal." 

She still wanted to be on the faculty of the McGill Medical School. They finally allowed her to become faculty in 1936, and then forced her to retire the same year. She traveled to give lectures. She also wrote many medical histories.

Others appreciated Abbott, however. She was named a fellow at the New York Academy of Medicine. She was widely acknowledged as the world's top expert on congenital heart disease.

Tirikatene-Sullivan was a titleholder for Ballroom dancing and American dancing. Tirikatene-Sullivan owned a boutique. Her boutique sold traditional Maori clothes and Polynesian inspired clothing. She was a role model for young people into fashion.

When Tirikatene-Sullivan was 20, she was told that she had tuberculosis. The doctors thought that it was caused by exposure to too many people, a busy schedule, and stress. Tirikatene-Sullivan advocated for other patients while she was in the hospital.

Working for her father as an unofficial assistant laid much of the foundation for Tirikatene-Sullivan's political career. She worked as secretary and research officer for the Labour Party's Maori Advisory Council and Maori Policy Committee for 10 years, accompanying her father to various official tribal hui events. 

In 1949, Tirikatene-Sullivan began working as a stenographer (a person trained to type or write in shorthand words) at the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) Headquarters in Wellington. Shortly after, in 1951, the RNZAF Headquarters assigned her to be the secretary to the assistant director of a planned royal tour. Tirikatene-Sullivan traveled as a member of New Zealand's official party during Queen Elizabeth II's royal tour of the country in 1953 and 1954.

Tirikatene-Sullivan was employed as a Maori welfare officer by the Department of Māori Affairs in 1958. She eventually also served as a child welfare officer in Rotorua and as a social security welfare officer in Lower Hutt and Wellington. She continued to volunteer for the Maori MPs as she had done, and studied part-time at Victoria University College. Tirikatene-Sullivan was named the Women’s Vice-President on the Executive of the Victoria University Students’ Association and and inaugural president of the Federation of Māori University Students in 1959. During her time in those positions, she advocated for the teaching of Maori studies in New Zealand universities. 

Tirikatene-Sullivan's studies ended abruptly in 1967 when her father died. 

She had a husband named Denis Sullivan who was a nuclear physicist.  They both had three children named May-Ana (born in 1970), Lisa Marie (born in 1972), and Tirikatene (1974). Tirikatene-Sullivan’s second child, Lisa Marie, died three months after she was born. Tirikatene-Sullivan gave birth while holding her position in office and believed strongly in combining her career with good parenting.

Many famous businesses believe her work is important. She is a Forbes 30 Under 30 member, Chanel Foundation recipient, Cartier Women's Initiative Laureate, and an Echoing Green Fellow. Her work has also been written about in many magazines like Teen Vogue, VogueBusiness, and Business of Fashion.

Rebecca Hui’s father was a professor. His work caused their family to move to new places. They moved about nine times during Hui’s childhood around the areas Hong Kong, New Jersey, and Arizona. Because there was a lot of moving around, she gained the ability to be able to adapt quickly to fit in. She also believed that her skill to pick up tiny differences between different communities came from her childhood.

In her sophomore year at University of California, Berkeley, she was feeling bad about not attending art school. A friend helped her get an internship at an architecture company in Gujarat, India. Her boss encouraged her to study Indian culture so she followed cows. Hui was surprised to learn that cows are very important in India. She became interested in the relationship between humans and animals because of her roommate. Her roommate was a Jain. Jainism believes in being kind and respectful to animals. Because of her roommate's kindness towards animals, Hui felt the same. While following cows she noticed that the relationship between cows and humans were very different in different areas. In rural areas, cows are common and are important for milk and farms. In cities they are used for commercial activity and sometimes are harmed by humans. Hui believes that protection of animals can help public policy. She has also tried studying elephants and leopards. During this time, she discovered that buildings were considered more important than wildlife was. She started to believe that animals were very important to keeping ecosystems alive that humans depend on.

Roots Studio is a New York based startup created by Rebecca Hui. It designs things influenced by Indigenous artists with two goals in mind. Their first goal is to give back the appreciation, credit and respect that the Indigenous artists deserve. Their second goal is to stop the cycle of cultural appropriation. Rebecca has been working with minority and Indigenous artists for the last ten years. She discovered that because of the lack of money and education, these artists were becoming laborers in cities. They could not make art. So Hui decided to create Roots Studio to form connections between communities and fashion to stop cultural loss and create more beauty in the world.

Hui is also working to found Toto Express. Toto Express is a design-licensing agency. Toto Express has projects where they look for artisans. In the Secret Life Project, Hui met many artists who were not able to make enough money because there was not enough marketing and connections. Hui wants a place where people can recognize the villagers' skills. She said she is dedicated to these projects because she “relates to these artists whose reasons for leaving their art spoke back to my reasons for pursuing a more respected career path within the often risk-adverse Chinese American community.”

Romaine Brooks

Romaine Brooks (born Beatrice Romaine Goddard; May 1, 1874 – December 7, 1970) was an American painter who often drew women in men’s clothing. She painted women from women's point of view, not from how men saw women. The Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., has collected half of her paintings. Experts say she is as important as Virginia Woolf and Gertrude Stein to how we think about gender.

Brooks was born in Rome. Her parents were rich Americans. She had an unhappy childhood. Her mother took care of her sick brother, and often did not take care of Brooks. Her mother believed Brooks was possessed by demons. 

Her mother left Europe with her son, and a poor but kind laundry woman took care of Brooks. Her mother did not let her draw, but the laundry woman did. 

Her grandfather found her and sent her to school. Students and teachers found her drawings of ghosts and monsters scary. 

When she was 14, she was sent to a school in Italy, where she was so unhappy she tried to kill herself. Her mother sent her to a school to learn manners in Switzerland, where she was very good at art and music. She became independent when she was 21. 

Brooks studied painting in Italy from 1896 to 1899. She then set up an art studio on the Island of Capri. She learned more about art when she was 24 at the Scuola Nazionale, a school in Rome. Many students were mean to her there. In 1900, she studied at the Académie Colarossi in Paris. 

Brooks did not want money from her mother, and wanted to be independent. She lost a lot of her money, so her sister Maya gave her some money. Brooks gave birth to her daughter in 1897, but gave her daughter to a school because she could not take care of her. She wanted to come back later for her baby. After five years, the school told her the baby died 3 months after it was born. She had a short marriage with John Ellingham Brooks in 1902. She met Natalie Clifford Barney, who would be her lover for a long time.

Her art was shown in the Durand-Ruel Gallery in Paris, and she became an artist. Some of her famous paintings are Azalées Blanches (White Azaleas) and La France Croisée. Her art style is like James McNeil Whistler’s, whose art she liked. Her paintings were often grey, whiter and black, with a little bit of colors like red, umber or ochre. She did not do things other artists were doing, different from Pablo Picasso, another artist. In 1930, Brooks wrote a book about herself called “No Pleasant Memories,” but no one ever saw it. 

In 1915 Brooks had a fundraiser exhibit to raise money for the Red Cross. To thank her, the French government gave her the Cross of the Legion of Honor.

Today, her art still has a result on others. She lived 100 years ago, but it is interesting to see how she showed things people did not talk about a lot in her paintings.

Tiny house

A tiny house, also known as a tiny home, is a type of house that is very small (up to 37 square metres or 400 sq ft).

Tiny houses can stand on a fixed place, but they can also be mobile. For example, a tiny house with wheels can be transported. They may also solve other kinds of problems. They may be a way for older children to have independence, yet also stay near their parents. Sometimes the family home is too small for children to have their own bedroom. A tiny house built in the grounds of a regular property may be the solution to allowing independence whilst keeping a degree of parental supervision.

The tiny house movement originated in the United States. 

Tiny houses gained more attention after the Great Recession, when houses became very expensive in many places.

The tiny house movement has inspired many reality television series:

She founded Elephant Nature Park and Save Elephant Foundation.

Sangdeaun “Lek” Chailert was born in 1961. She was born in a village in Thailand called Baan Lao. This village was located in the Northern Mountains of Thailand. Starting from a young age, she spent a lot of time with animals and loved them. She looked up to her grandfather. He was a shaman, which is a traditional healer. He helped sick and injured people within his community, and would also help sick animals. Chailert helped her grandfather take care of the animals. She developed a passion for it. She witnessed the horrible abuse of elephants when she was sixteen years old. The elephants were forced to carry logs into the jungle. Chailert graduated from Chiang Mai University, a public university in Northern Thailand.

Chailert advocates for Asian Elephants. She founded Elephant Nature Park (ENP). Elephant Nature Park is a sanctuary for abused Asian Elephants in Chiang Mai Province in Thailand.

Chailert continues to advocate for Asian Elephants and tries her best to raise awareness throughout the world. She has successfully rescued over 200 elephants. She first started taking action after witnessing elephants being forced to carry logs into the jungle. She later realized that all this abuse deeply affects their mental health. In fact, some elephants have become blind because of slingshots targeted at their eyes as well as the bright lights in a circus. Elephants endure intense training for circuses. Many elephants are taken away from their parents at a very young age, which significantly affects them later in life. Some elephants get chained up on their legs, causing them to bleed because of the deep cuts in their legs. Because of the harsh conditions, many elephants become very aggressive and develop a lot of trauma. Elephants are commonly forced to do tricks, get ridden, and do paintings using their trunks. They are also used for their ivory. They are also forced to do extremely tough labor. Many elephants suffer from abuse that is involved with logging, tourism, circuses, and street begging. Elephants are meant to be in the wild and be independent. They are not meant to be used as entertainment for humans. Many people are not aware of how this affects elephants. Chailert’s mentality is that an elephant isn’t just an animal; they are a person. That is why she treats them with respect. She treats them as if they are part of her family. Chailert was taught to respect nature at a young age. Chailert acknowledges the fact that more people are being educated about this topic. She hopes more people are informed. She would like others to spread the word.

All so thought out, so necessarily functional that the eye passes over this intelligent painting without ever noticing the slightest imbalance. The tones themselves obey this harmonious criterion that does not admit of coloristic affectation: a few whites and abundant warm colors unmistakably mark this nourished painting, but where one never feels the labor of creation »". Still lifes reflect the humble things of our home and our canteen, emanating that almost religious sense of secular use that dresses them with unexpected nobility [...] oriented towards a constant search for color and formal perfection.

Evangelina Villegas

Evangelina Villegas (October 24, 1924 – April 24, 2017) was a Mexican food scientist. Villegas invented a type of maize called QPM. QPM (Quality Protein Maize) has twice as much lysine and tryptophan (important amino acids) as regular maize. Kids who consume QPM grow 15% faster than kids who consume regular maize. It puts children at a significantly lowered risk of malnutrition disorders. QPM has helped people around the world. It now makes up 75% of the corn grown in Ghana. 

Villegas attended the National Polytech Institute. She received a bachelor's in chemistry and biology there. She later received her masters in cereal technology from Kansas State in the 1960s. Villegas also earned a PhD in cereal chemistry and breeding from North Dakota State University. 

Evangelina Villegas first worked as a chemist and researcher at Mexico’s National Institute of Nutrition in the 1950s. She then worked in the Wheat Industrial Quality Chemical Laboratory at the Special Studies Office in 1957. Villegas moved on to work at CIMMYT in 1967. 

Villegas worked at CIMMYT from 1967 to 1989. She conducted research to analyze nutrition in corn. She collaborated with Dr. Surinder Vasal. Vasal was a plant breeder. He had a pHd in genetics and plant breeding. Vasal and Villegas worked together to create QPM. QPM saves lives and lowers the risk of malnutrition. It has key amino acids in it to help children. 

Evangelina Villegas was the first woman to get the World Food Prize. Mexico’s National institute for Agriculture honored her. The National Polytech Institute titled Villegas as a Distinguished Former Student in 1972. The National Polytechnic Institute’s school of Biological Sciences also honored her six years later. Villegas was added to Alpha Delta Kappa’s List of International Women of Distinction. She received the Lazardo Cardenas medal in 2001.

Electrical resistance and conductance

Resistance, measured in ohms (symbolized by the Greek letter omega - Ω), is a measure of the opposition to current flow in an electrical circuit.

When an electron moves through a conductor like a metal wire, is when an electric current would flow. Colliding of different moving ions in the metal makes it harder for current to flow which is what causes resistance.

The longer a wire is, the more resistance there is because of the amount of collisions within being more as they pass; this means that the relationship between the two are proportional.

On the other hand, the thinner a wire is, the more resistance. This is because of the space of the passing ions being less meaning the collisions increase. That makes them inversely proportional.

As Resistance increases, current decreases making them inversely proportional.

Resistance can be calculated by measuring current via an ammeter and potential difference via a voltmeter and using Ohm’s law.

Colette of Corbie

Early in the 15th century St. Colette of Corbie (1381–1447), in France, sought to reform the order. She restored the primitive observance in 17 monasteries during her lifetime and reasserted the strict principle of poverty; her followers came to be called the Colettine Poor Clares, or Poor Clares of St. Colette (P.C.C.), and today are located mostly in France. The Capuchin Sisters, originating in Naples in 1538, and the Alcantarines, of 1631, are also Poor Clares of the strict observance.

Railroad Valley springfish

The Railroad Valley springfish ("Crenichthys nevadae") is a fish that lives in North America. It lives in Nevada in the United States of America.

This fish is 6 cm long.

People have seen the Railroad Valley springfish in six places where the water comes out of the ground hot. The fish came there as Railroad Lake dried up. Currently, they still live in Big, North, Hay Corral, and Reynolds Springs, but they have disappeared from the other places. People have also brought them to live in ponds in other places, for example Sadaville, Creek Canyon, and Chimney Spring. Scientists have not checked if it has a bad effect on the places people brought it.

It is endangered because people brought other fish to the places where it lives. It is also endangered because human beings take water out of their streams and ponds, because human beings change the places where it lives, and because cows and other livestock step on the fish when they come to their ponds to drink water.

Royal Canadian Army Cadets

The Royal Canadian Army Cadets (often shortened to "army cadets") is a national program for young people in Canada. The Department of National Defense, private sponsors, nearby communities, and the Army Cadet League of Canada pay for the program. People between the ages of 12 and 18 inclusive can join this program for free, and they are led by the officers of the Canadian Forces Cadet Instructor Cadre (CIC). Army cadets are not members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) and do not have to join the Army when they finish being RCACs.

The army cadets use a top-down rank structure similar to the Canadian Army.

The rank of Lance Corporal can have a different name depending on the Canadian Army regiment sponsoring them. For example, a corps sponsored by a Highland regiment will have different rank names than a corps sponsored by the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery.

In a corps sponsored by the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery, the rank of Master Corporal (MCpl) is called Master Bombardier (MBdr), and the rank of Corporal is called Bombardier (Bdr) instead of the usual names. In the guards regiments, Warrant Officers (WO) are known as Colour Sergeants (CSgt), and Second Lieutenants are known as Ensigns. A cadet cannot hold the rank of Second Lieutenant, as it is an officer rank.

Canadian Cadets who perform very well in their duties as a cadet can be given medals and awards, which are worn on their uniform. The medals are similar in style to the medals given to CAF service members. Cadets may be awarded medals if they show bravery, citizenship, cadet service, service during a summer training course, and more. Cadets may also wear any that they have received.

In the cadets, there are several honours and awards cadets from all branches (Army, Sea, and Air) and some that are unique to each. A cadet who goes from from one element to another can still wear any medals from their previous service, but generally, army cadets may have the chance to receive following eight honours and awards. These awards are listed in the order of importance.

2022 UEFA Champions League Final

The 2022 UEFA Champions League Final was the final match of the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League, the 67th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA. It was played at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, France, on 28 May 2022, between English club Liverpool and Spanish club Real Madrid. It was the third time the two sides have met in the European Cup final, after 1981 and 2018, the third final held here, after the 2000 and 2006 finals, and the first time the same two teams have met in three finals.

This was the first final to be played in front of a full attendance since the 2019 final, as the previous two finals were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The final was originally scheduled to be played at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany. After the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final, the final hosts were moved back a year, so the 2022 final was given to the Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, UEFA called an extraordinary meeting of the executive committee, where it was expected to officially remove the match out of Russia. A day later, it announced the final would move to the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, located just north of Paris.

Real Madrid won the match 1–0 via a 59th-minute goal from Vinícius Júnior for a record-extending 14th title, and their 5th in nine years. As the winners of the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid earned the right to play against the winners of the 2021–22 UEFA Europa League, Eintracht Frankfurt, in the 2022 UEFA Super Cup. Additionally, the winners regularly qualify for the annual FIFA Club World Cup. However, the tournament's status remains uncertain, following FIFA's proposal for a format improvement.

Liverpool played in their 10th European Cup/UEFA Champions League final. They had previously won six finals (in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 2005 and 2019) and lost three (in 1985, 2007 and 2018). This was the fourth UEFA Champions League final for manager Jürgen Klopp, after his loss with Borussia Dortmund in 2013 and the Liverpool finals in 2018 and 2019. In addition to their six European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, Liverpool also played in one European Cup Winners' Cup final, losing in 1966 against Borussia Dortmund, and in four UEFA Cup/Europa League finals, winning in 1973, 1976 and 2001 and losing in 2016. Their manager Jürgen Klopp was looking to become the fourth successive German to manage a Champions League-winning club.

Real Madrid played in a record 17th European Cup/UEFA Champions League final, and the first since their win in 2018 against Liverpool. They previously won 13 finals (in 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018) and lost three (1962, 1964 and 1981). Their manager Carlo Ancelotti reached a record fifth UEFA Champions League final as manager, winning in 2003 and 2007 and losing in 2005 while in charge of Milan, and winning the 2014 final with Real Madrid, and was looking to become the first manager in history to win four UEFA Champions League titles and eight European trophies. Real Madrid also played in two European Cup Winners' Cup finals (losing in 1971 and 1983) and two UEFA Cup finals (winning in 1985 and 1986).

This was a record-third time that the two teams meet in the final, after the 1981 final, which was held in the Parc des Princes in Paris and in which Liverpool prevailed 1–0, and the 2018 final held at the Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex in Kyiv, which was won 3–1 by Real Madrid. This was also the third final for Carlo Ancelotti as manager against Liverpool, after the 2005 and 2007 finals; he also lost the 1984 final as a player for Roma. This was the sixth time a Spanish side met a English team in the final of the competition, after the 1981, 2006 (won by Barcelona against Arsenal), the 2009 and 2011 finals (both won by Barcelona against Manchester United), and the 2018 final.

Besides the 1981 and 2018 finals, the two clubs met each other six times. Liverpool won both matches in the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League round of 16 (1–0 away and 4–0 at home). The two clubs were drawn in the same group in the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League group stage, with Real Madrid winning 3–0 away and 1–0 at home. In the 2020–21 quarter-finals, the Spanish side won 3–1 at home and held a 0–0 draw at Anfield to ensure progression to the semi-finals.

"In the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup era, since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League era."
The final was originally awarded to the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany. When the forced the 2020 final to be relocated from the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul to the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, the Allianz Arena was reawarded with the 2023 final and the 2022 final was given to the original host of the 2021 final, the Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg.

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, UEFA organised an emergency meeting of its executive committee on 25 February, at which it decided to move the final to the Stade de France in Saint-Denis. Other cities proposed as replacement hosts were Amsterdam, Barcelona, Munich and Rome. This was the first UEFA Champions League final to take place in France since 2006.

An open bidding process was launched on 28 September 2018 by UEFA to select the venues of the finals of the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and UEFA Women's Champions League in 2021. Associations had until 26 October 2018 to express interest, and bid information must be submitted by 15 February 2019. UEFA announced on 1 November 2018 that two associations had expressed interest in hosting the 2021 UEFA Champions League final, and on 22 February 2019 that both associations submitted their information by the deadline.

The Krestovsky Stadium was selected by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Ljubljana, Slovenia on 24 September 2019, where the hosts for the 2021 and 2023 UEFA Champions League finals were also appointed.

On 17 June 2020, the UEFA Executive Committee announced that due to the postponement and relocation of the 2020 final caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, Saint Petersburg would instead host the 2022 final.

"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away)."
The original logo of the 2022 UEFA Champions League Final at Saint Petersburg was unveiled at the group stage draw on 26 August 2021 in Istanbul.

The ambassadors for the final were former Liverpool and Real Madrid forwards Ian Rush and . Originally, former Russia and Zenit Saint Petersburg forward Andrey Arshavin was chosen to be the ambassador, though this was changed after the final's relocation to Saint-Denis. Rush was previously chosen as an ambassador for the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final at Cardiff, Wales, in which Real Madrid defeated Juventus.

On 11 May 2022, UEFA named Frenchman Clément Turpin as the referee for the final. He was joined by five of his fellow countrymen, including assistant referees Nicolas Danos and Cyril Gringore. Benoît Bastien served as the fourth official, while Jérôme Brisard acted as the video assistant referee. Willy Delajod was appointed as one of the assistant VAR officials, along with Italian referees Massimiliano Irrati and Filippo Meli.

Cuban-born American singer Camila Cabello performed for the opening ceremony before the start of the match. Cabello performed her songs "Señorita", "Havana", "Bam Bam" and "Don't Go Yet".

Crowd control descended into chaos at the entrances to the Stade de France prior to the beginning of the match. By 21:00 local time, the originally scheduled kick-off time, thousands of seats remained empty in the Liverpool end. For "security reasons", the kick-off was initially delayed by 15 minutes to 21:15. This was further delayed by 15 minutes to 21:30, before being pushed back another 6 minutes to 21:36, eventually started at 21:37.

The "home" team (for administrative purposes) was determined by an additional draw held after the quarter-final and semi-final draws.

Gila topminnow

The Gila topminnow or charalito ("Poeciliopsis occidentalis") is a fish in the family Poeciliidae. It lives in North America and Mexico.

This fish lives in the southern United States and northern Mexico. It lives as far south as the Gila River.

The mosquitofish killed so many Gila topminnows that the Gila topminnow became endangered. People put it on the Endangered Species List in 1973. Since then, human beings brought the fish to many new places where it could live.

This fish is still in some danger because human beings change the places where it lives, because invasive species kill it or eat all the food, and because human beings have changed the water table. When human beings take water from wells for farming and other things, the water sinks lower down in the earth. This can make streams and ponds dry up.

Because this fish now lives in so many places, it is officially not endangered any more. However, scientists are still studying it.

This fish looks like a guppy, but it has no spots on its fins. It is about 2.5 to 5 cm in size. Male fish are black with yellow fins. This fish lives about 1 year.

There are two subspecies:


This fish eats many different kinds of things: dead things, plants, insect larvae, and crustaceans. Sometimes they eat their own babies.

Topminnows keep their eggs inside their bodies until they hatch. There are 1-20 eggs in each brood. Sometimes the mother fish carries two broods at a time. The eggs take 24-28 days to hatch. Young fish hide from the adults so the adults won't eat them.

It is endangered because people brought other fish to the places where it lives. The mosquitofish is the most important of these animals. It is also endangered because human beings take water out of their streams and ponds.

Zuleyma Tang-Martinez

Zuleyma Tang-Martinez (born in Venezuela, March 9, 1945) is a Latina Professor Emeritus in Biology at the University of Missouri-Saint Louis. She is well known for her research in animal behavior and in how animals recognize family members. She studies these behaviors in mice, voles, gerbils, and capybaras. Without her research, we would not know much about chemical communication between mammals.

Tang-Martinez was born in Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela.

She has two younger sisters. Yajarayama Tang-Feldman is now a researcher at the University of California, Davis School of Nursing. Morayma Tang-Martinez lives in Venezuela.

Her father was an accountant. He worked for American oil companies in Venezuela. The companies were all drilling for oil near rainforests. They moved to a new camp every few years. Tang-Martinez liked to observe capybaras and other animals from the rainforest.

When she was seven, Tang-Martinez's family moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA. She lived there for two years.

Later in his life, her father suffered from Alzheimer's Disease.

Tang-Martinez returned to the United States for high school. The oil camps' schools did not have high school.

She studied biology at Saint Louis University. She graduated in 1967.

At University of California, Berkeley, Tang-Martinez studied Zoology (M.A., 1970; Ph.D. 1976). In graduate school Tang-Martinez developed the "habituation-discrimination technique" to measure how animals communicate using smell.

She did two more years of research at the University of British Columbia before working as an assistant professor at University of Missouri, St. Louis.

Tang-Martinez was on the faculty of University of Misouri-St. Louis from 1976-2014. In 2014 she retired.

Tang-Martinez studies social behavior in animals. Animals create chemicals and use the chemicals' smells to communicate with other animals.

Tang-Martinez and her female partner, Arlene Zarembka wanted to get married. In 2013 they applied for money that married people get from Social Security when one person retires. The state of Missouri said no.

Tang-Martinez was both the first woman and the first Latinx individual to become a full professor in her department.

Tang-Martinez wants many different kinds of people to be Animal Behavior Scientists. She founded the Latin American Affairs Committee, the Turner Undergraduate Diversity Program, and the Diversity Fund when she was president of the Animal Behavior Society.

SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant

The Omicron variant (or B.1.1.529) is a form of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from South Africa on 24 November 2021. On 26 November 2021, the WHO called it a variant of concern, and named it "Omicron". 

Etymology: Omicron is a letter in the Greek alphabet.

BA.2.86, or Pirola, is a descendant of the parent lineage (B.1.1.529). It has been known to media since August 2023. Research has not shown (as of 2023's third quarter) if this variant can possibly be more dangerous than other variants that are in circulation (or spreading infection from some people to more people). The variant has been found in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. It has "dozens of genetic changes". Related page: mutation.

BA.2.86, samples are from as early as July 2023; It is on the list of "Variants under monitoring" (according to WHO, as of 2023's third quarter). The variant is a descendant of the parent lineage (or B.1.1.529) of the Omicron variant.



Omicron multiplies around 70 times faster than the Delta variant in the bronchi, but it is less severe than other strains, especially the Delta variant. Omicron might be less able to enter deep lung tissue. Omicron infections are 91 percent less fatal than the delta variant, with 51 percent less risk of hospitalization.

Vaccines can protect against severe disease and hospitalisation especially after a third dose of an mRNA vaccine is given. Early data found that double vaccination give 30 to 40 percent protection against infection and around 70 percent protection against hospitalization. A recent third vaccine dose boosts effectiveness against infection to around 75 percent, and 88 percent for severe disease.

SARS-CoV-2 Gamma variant

Hollow Knight

Hollow Knight is a 2017 Metroidvania action-adventure game developed and published by Team Cherry. It was released on Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux in 2017, and on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2018. Development was partially funded through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, raising over 57,000 by the end of 2014.

The player is the Knight, a nameless warrior not knowing who they are or where they came from, who wanders and explores the ruined kingdom of Hallownest to figure out its mysteries, finds many friendly or enemy bugs, fighting bosses, and unlocking new powers and abilities to progress. "Hollow Knight" was well received by critics and has sold over 3 million copies as of December 2020. A sequel, "", is in development.

"Hollow Knight" is a 2D Metroidvania action-adventure game, that takes place in Hallownest, a fictional ancient kingdom. The player controls an insect-like, silent, and nameless character while exploring the underground world. The knight wields a "nail", which represents various blades in the story (excluding pins and needles), used both in combat and environmental interaction.

In most areas of the game, players encounter enemy bugs and other creatures. Melee combat involves using the nail to hit enemies from a short distance. The player can learn spells, which give the knight more range. Defeated enemies drop currency called Geo. The knight starts with 5 masks, which represent the hit points of the character. "Mask shards" can be collected throughout the game to increase the player's maximum health. When the knight takes damage from an enemy or from the environment, a mask is reduced. By striking enemies, the knight gains Soul, which is stored in the Soul Vessel. If all masks are lost, the knight dies and a Shade appears where they died. The player loses all Geo and can hold a reduced amount of Soul. Players need to defeat the Shade to recover the lost currency and to carry the normal amount of Soul. The game continues from the last visited bench they sat on which are scattered throughout the game world and act as save points. Initially the player can only use Soul to "Focus" and regenerate masks, but as the game progresses players unlock several offensive spells, which consume Soul.

Many areas feature more challenging enemies and bosses which the player may need to defeat in order to progress further. Defeating some bosses grants the player new abilities. Later in the game, players acquire a "dream nail", a special blade that can "cut through the veil between dreams and waking". It enables the player to face more challenging versions of a few bosses, and to break what is sealing the path to the final boss. If the player defeats the final boss of the game, called "The Hollow Knight", they are given access to a mode called "Steel Soul". In this mode, dying is permanent, and if the knight loses all of their masks, the save slot will be reset.

During the game, the player encounters non-player characters (NPCs) with whom they can interact. These characters give information about the game's plot or lore, sometimes help, and sell items or services. The player can upgrade the knight's nail to deal more damage or find Soul Vessels to carry more Soul. During the game, players acquire items that give new movement abilities which are an additional mid-air jump (Monarch Wings), sticking to walls and jumping off them (Mantis Claw), a brief dash (Mothwing Cloak), and an acid resistance buff (Isma's Tear). The player can learn other combat abilities, such as nail arts, and the spells. To further customize the knight, players can use different Charms, which can be found or bought from NPCs. Some of their effects include better combat abilities or skills, more masks or their regeneration, better movement skills, easier collecting of Geo or of Soul, and transformation. Equipping a Charm takes up a certain number of limited slots, called notches. Wearing a Charm that requires more than the available number of notches is possible, but it results in being "overcharmed", causing the knight to take double damage.

Hallownest consists of several large, connected areas with unique themes. With its nonlinear gameplay design, "Hollow Knight" does not force the player to one path through the game nor make them explore the whole game, though there are obstacles that stop the player's access to an area. The player may need to progress in the story of the game, or get a specific movement ability, skill, or item to progress further. To fast travel through the game's world, the player can use Stag Stations, terminals of a network of tunnels; players can only travel to previously visited and unlocked stations. Other fast travel methods, such as trams, lifts, and the "Dreamgate", are encountered later in the game.

As the player enters a new area, they do not have access to the map of the area. They must find Cornifer, the cartographer, in order to buy a rough map. As the player explores an area, the map becomes more accurate and complete, although it is updated only when sitting on a bench. The player will need to buy specific items to complete maps, to see points of interest, and to place markers. The knight's position on the map can only be seen if the player is carrying the Wayward Compass Charm.

The idea that made the creators want to create "Hollow Knight" started in a game jam, Ludum Dare 2013, in which two of the game's developers, Ari Gibson and William Pellen, made a game called "Hungry Knight", in which the character that would later become the Knight kills bugs to stave off starvation. The game, thought to be "not very good", used to hold a 1/5 star rating on Newgrounds but has since increased to 4/5. The developers decided to work on another game jam with the theme "Beneath the Surface", but could not complete on time. However, this gave them the idea to create a game with an underground setting, a "deep, old kingdom", and insects.

Influences for the game include "Faxanadu", "Metroid", "", and "Mega Man X". Team Cherry noted that Hallownest was in some ways the inverse of the world tree setting in "Faxanadu." The team also said that they wanted to create the sense of wonder and discovery of games from their childhood from such games, in which "there could be any crazy secret or weird creature."

Believing that control of the character was most important for the player's enjoyment of the game, the developers based the Knight's movement on "Mega Man X". They gave the character no acceleration or deceleration when moving horizontally, as well as a large amount of aerial control and the ability to interrupt one's jump with a dash. This was meant to make the player feel that any hit they took could have been avoided right up until the last moment.

To create the game's art, Gibson's hand-drawn sketches were scanned directly into the game engine, creating a "vivid sense of place". The developers decided to "keep it simple" in order to stop the development time from becoming very long. The complexity of the world was based on "Metroid", which allows players to become lost, focusing on the enjoyment of finding one's way. Only basic signs are placed throughout the world to direct players to important locations. The biggest design challenge for the game was creating the mapping system and finding a balance between not divulging the world's secrets while not being too player-unfriendly.

"Hollow Knight" was revealed on Kickstarter in November 2014, the developers needing 35,000. The game passed this goal, raising more than 57,000 from 2,158 backers, allowing more content to be added and another developer to be hired—technical director David Kazi—as well as composer Christopher Larkin. The game reached a beta state in September 2015 and continued to achieve many unreasonable goals to add in more content after an engine switch from Stencyl to Unity. Some of the goal content, such as The Abyss, still made it into the game even though those goals not having been achieved, although with a lot of content was cut.

The Nintendo Switch version of "Hollow Knight" was announced in January 2017 and released on 12 June 2018. Team Cherry originally planned to make their game available on the Wii U. Development of the Wii U version began in 2016, alongside the PC version, and it eventually shifted to Switch. The creators of "Hollow Knight" worked with another Australian developer, Shark Jump Studios, to speed up the porting process. Initially, Team Cherry planned the Switch version to arrive "not too long after the platform's launch"; subsequently they delayed it to early 2018. A release date was not announced until the Nintendo Direct presentation at E3 2018 on 12 June 2018, when it was unveiled the game would be available later that day via Nintendo eShop.

On 3 August 2017, the "Hidden Dreams" DLC was released, featuring two new optional boss encounters, two new songs, a new fast travel system, and a new Stag Station. On 26 October 2017, "The Grimm Troupe" was released, adding new quests, new boss fights, new charms, new enemies, and other content. The update also added support for Russian, Portuguese, and Japanese translations of the game. On 20 April 2018, "Lifeblood" was released, bringing many optimizations, changes to the colors, bug fixes, minor additions and a new boss fight. On 23 August 2018, the final DLC, "Godmaster" was released, containing new characters, boss fights, music, a new game mode as well as two new endings. It was renamed from its former title of "Gods and Glory" due to trademark issues.

"Hollow Knight"s PC and PlayStation 4 versions received "generally favorable" reviews and the Nintendo Switch and Xbox One versions received "universal acclaim", according to review aggregator Metacritic. Jed Whitaker of "Destructoid" talked about it as a "masterpiece of gaming ..., and certainly art worthy of being in a museum" and, on "PC Gamer", Tom Marks called it a "new classic". Reviewers talked of "Hollow Knight"s good atmosphere, visuals, sound and music, noting the vastness of the game's world.

Critics thought the combat system as simple, unsurprising or nuanced; they talked about its responsiveness positively, or "tightness", like the movement system. On "IGN", Tom Marks said: "The combat in Hollow Knight is relatively straightforward, but starts out tricky ... It rewards patience and skill massively". In his review on "PC Gamer", Marks said he liked the "brilliant" charm system: "What's so impressive about these charms is that I could never find a 'right' answer when equipping them. There were no wrong choices." "NintendoWorldReport" said: "Charms offer a huge variety of upgrades ... Some charms ... were so essential that removing them felt like trading a part of myself for a better chance at an upcoming battle."

The difficulty of "Hollow Knight" got attention from reviewers and was talked about as challenging; Vikki Blake of "Eurogamer" called the game "ruthlessly tough, even occasionally unfair". For "Nintendo World Report"s Adam Abou-Nasr it also seemed unfair—he had "so frustratingly hard that I cannot recommend this game" angrily scrawled in his notes—but "it eventually clicked". "Destructoid" "never found any of the bosses to be unfair". "Destructoid" and "Nintendo World Report" reviewers felt a sense of accomplishment after hard fights. Critics compared it to "Dark Souls", noting the mechanic of losing currency on death and having to defeat a Shade to regain it. "Destructoid" liked this feature, as well as the holding down of a button to heal, because "they circumvent a couple of issues games have always had, namely appropriate punishment for failing, and a risk-reward system".

"Hollow Knight" had sold over 500,000 copies by November 2017 and passed 1,000,000 in sales on PC platforms on 11 June 2018, one day before releasing on Nintendo Switch, where it had sold over 250,000 copies in the two weeks after its launch. By July 2018 it had sold over 1,250,000 copies. As of February 2019, "Hollow Knight" has sold over 2,800,000 copies.

The game was nominated for "Best PC Game" in "Destructoid"s Game of the Year Awards 2017, and for "Best Platformer" in "IGN"'s Best of 2017 Awards. It won the award for "Best Platformer" in "PC Gamer"s 2017 Game of the Year Awards. "Polygon" later named the game among the decade's best.
A sequel, "," is in development and is set to be released on Microsoft Windows, Mac, Linux, and Nintendo Switch, with Team Cherry stating that "more platforms may happen in the future". Team Cherry had previously planned this game as a piece of downloadable content. Kickstarter backers of "Hollow Knight" will get "Silksong" for free when it is released. This sequel will be about Hornet exploring the kingdom of Pharloom. The game was announced in February 2019 but does not have a release date yet.

Hollow Knight: Silksong

Hollow Knight: Silksong is an upcoming Metroidvania action-adventure video game developed and published by Team Cherry for Windows, macOS, Linux and Nintendo Switch. It was originally announced in February 2019 as a sequel to the 2017 game "Hollow Knight".

"Hollow Knight: Silksong" is a 2D Metroidvania action-adventure game, which takes place in a haunted kingdom inhabited by bugs.

The gameplay is similar to that Hollow Knight. The player controls Hornet, an insect like creature who uses a needle to fight enemies. During her adventure, Hornet finds many hostile creatures. The game has 165 confirmed different enemies. Hornet will also find many friendly non-player characters.

"Silksong" will have a quest system, with characters asking Hornet to do what they want. The quest system has at least four sections: Hunt, Gather, Wayfarer and Grand Hunt. Hornet will be able to craft weapons and tools from materials.

The checkpoint system from the first game will return in "Silksong".

Instead of using soul to heal like the Knight from "Hollow Knight" did, Hornet uses silk. She can near instantly heal three empty masks on the move using an ability called "Bind" instead of needing to stop and slowly heal one mask at a time like the Knight, which could put it in danger from receiving more damage. However, this depletes her entire bar of silk. Upon death, instead of leaving a Shade like the Knight did, Hornet instead leaves a cocoon of silk that refills all 8 notches of silk in her bar when broken. Hornet loses the main currency of the game, rosaries, upon death without the Rosary String item and they cannot be regained.

Hornet finds herself captured and taken to the kingdom of Pharloom, which is said to be "ruled by Silk and Song." Hornet must climb to the top of this kingdom to reach a citadel in order to find out why she was brought to this strange kingdom. This is opposite with the progression of "Hollow Knight", which involves descending into the depths of Hallownest and trying to stop the infection plaguing the Kingdom. Along the way, she fights many powerful opponents including knights, warriors and assassins.

Team Cherry is a small indie development studio based in Adelaide, South Australia.

"Hollow Knight: Silksong" was announced on 14 February 2019 in a trailer and with a developer diary video sharing more information about the game. The game will be released for Windows PC, Mac and Linux, with Nintendo Switch being the only console to receive the game at launch.

During the Xbox & Bethesda Games Showcase, it was revealed that the game would be coming to Xbox Game Pass through PC and Xbox Series X/S. It was also revealed that the game would be coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

Originally, Hornet was planned as a second playable character to be included in a downloadable content pack (DLC) for "Hollow Knight", funded as a stretch goal in the game's Kickstarter campaign. Eventually, Team Cherry decided to expand the DLC to a full sequel. While in the process, Team Cherry revealed some of the character animations for Hornet and Steel Assassin Sharpe, a villain from the game.

The developers released an update about the game in March 2019, sharing descriptions and images of characters who will appear in "Silksong". They thanked the game's fans for supporting them about the announcement of the sequel. Team Cherry released a 16-minute playable demo of the game at E3 2019 that had two new areas: Deep Docks and Moss Grotto.

In December 2019, Team Cherry released a preview of the game's soundtrack, composed by Christopher Larkin, as well as an update on the total number of enemies currently developed, with a focus on three enemies, described as "members of a scholarly suite."

In September 2021 the GeForce Now upcoming database was leaked, which included the release date of Hollow Knight: Silksong as February 2022 for some downloads of said database. However others found the date as "NULL". These dates are speculative according to Nvidia but have shown varying amounts of accuracy for other games on release.

December 2021 North American storm complex and derecho

During the afternoon and evening of Wednesday, December 15, 2021 a low pressure system brought strong, violent winds (both thunderstorm-involved and non-thunderstorm). Non-thunderstorm winds and gusts led to rapidly moving fires across Colorado and western Kansas. Dust and debris spread eastward from there. A powerful derecho (intense and very dangerous showers and thunderstorms having straight line winds and often varying levels of rain) led to several hundred damaging wind reports. That started from central Kansas northeast to east-central Wisconsin. The United States' National Weather Service got fifty-five hurricane force wind reports. The derecho was considered the most prolific (meaning productive) such event dating back to 2004, although a derecho five months later would become even more prolific.

On December 15, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) warned of the potential (possibility) of severe, widespread and intense wind events from the eastern Great Plains to the western Great Lakes region. Along with strong winds, dry lines and a very strong cold front were forecast to be supported with a strong low pressure area southward into northeastern Missouri.

Right ahead of these components, out-of-season air masses were predicted to take shape across several states. In Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin, temperatures were from between 30°F and 45°F higher than December averages. Dew points reached into the lower 60s Fahrenheit. Given these ingredients, along with a weakening cap inversion, forecasters called for severe thunderstorms to get started and become widespread over the Upper Mississippi and Mid-Missouri valleys. Strong, damaging winds were the most predicted threat. Tornadoes, though, were also possible. One to two EF2 and greater were not ruled out.

On Monday, December 13 just before 2:30 am Central Standard Time (0830 UTC), forecasters stated a level 1/5 marginal risk for severe weather between 60 and 78 hours from there. The original severe likelihood was focused on areas from eastern Nebraska, across Iowa and south central Minnesota. Two days following that, just before midnight on December 14 (0600 UTC December 15), the level was upgraded towards moderate in north central and western Iowa. The same level of probability extended into southeastern Minnesota and west-central Wisconsin near La Crosse, Winona and nearby Rochester. Slight or enhanced chances involved other areas of the same states. Included in the slight or enhanced risk area were Eau Claire, the Minneapolis–Saint Paul Metropolitan Area and the Cedar Rapids–Iowa City metropolitan regions of eastern Iowa. That was the first moderate risk ever called across Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota in December of any year.

The first tornado watch for December 15 was called into effect at 1:20 pm CST (1920 UTC). The watch involved sections of eastern Nebraska, northeastern Kansas, northwestern Missouri, large sections of Iowa and south-central Minnesota. That was right after a quick-traveling thunderstorm line got into progress.

Along with the severe thunderstorms' damaging winds, the similar unrelated winds also became widespread that day. Many National Weather Service offices had almost 84 million people in the high wind warning notice alone.

The intensity and scope with the dry wind led to very dangerous fire weather situations across the Central Plains. Within that region, SPC officials outlined an important critical region from the Texas Panhandle to central Kansas. Extreme regions also included eastern Colorado and northeastern New Mexico.

In Colorado, particularly across the central and eastern sections of the state, an Air Quality alert was activated in anticipation of the combined air and dust over the area. There were rolling road closures across Interstates 25 and 70. On the earlier, six tractor trailers (semi trucks) turned over or flipped in strong winds in Colorado Springs.

In Pueblo city bus services were suspended for more than three hours. Some trees in the area were damaged. Roofs were ripped from homes. Fences and lots of vehicles were blown over during the winds. Power lines were downed all over the area.

In advance of the dangerous weather, several school and education districts in southwestern Kansas had to close classes. Strong, powerful winds stirred dust all over Kansas. State Departments of Transportation closed several highways. In particular, Interstate 70 from the Colorado-Kansas state border east to Salina for crashes blocking the road. Two separate crashes from poor visibility led to the deaths of three people in the state.

In nearby Nebraska, winds of just below 85 mph were reported at Grand Island. There, several rail cars were blown over. Local authorities were notified of blown out vehicles' windows, felled trees, downed power lines and flipped over semi-trucks.

Across Iowa, similarly violent winds happened. Hurricane-force wind gusts took place. Near Audubon, winds gusted to 88 mph. One man was killed when a gust blew down his semi-tractor-trailer.

In Minnesota just north, another man was killed when a tree landed onto him.

Almost eight dozen tornadoes were caused related to the storm. One in particular was later established for the first tornado in Minnesota in December. According to the National Weather Service, there were twenty tornadoes in that state.

Plectrohyla chrysopleura

Plectrohyla chrysopleura is a frog that lives in Honduras. Scientists have seen it between 930 and 1550 meters above sea level.

The Latin name for this frog "chrysopleura" comes from the Greek words "chrysos," for "gold," and "pleura" for "side." It is named after the yellow marks on the sides of its body.

The adult male frog is 56.6 to 65.6 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 63.3 to 65.6 mm long. This frog has teeth. It has disks on its toes for climbing. This frog is gray in color with some bronze. It has yellow marks on its sides. Its eardrums are bronze or copper in color. Its belly is yellow-gray. Its legs are yellow and olive green.

Adult female frogs and young frogs of both sexes have some dark brown color too.

This frog lays eggs in streams.

Scientists think this frog is endangered because human beings change the places where it lives when they cut down trees for logging, turn forests into farms, or let cows and other animals eat grass in them. It is also endangered because of not enough rainfall, floods, and climate change. The fungal disease chytridiomycosis can also kill this frog.

Kara Koyunlu

The Qara Qoyunlu or Kara Koyunlu () were a tribal alliance of Oghuz tribes. They ruled Azerbaijan, Armenia, eastern Anatolia, and northern Iraq from 1375 to 1468.  The Kara Koyunlus settled in the south of Lake Van. They became strong in Erzincan, Sivas and in the north-eastern lands of Eastern Anatolia in the 1370s. The Kara Koyunla fought against the Aq Qoyunlu, Jalairis, and Timurid.

The Qara Qoyunlu dynasty was founded by Bayram Khoja.  His successor, Qara Muhammad, became related to Jalairi Sultan Ahmad in order to end problems with the Jalairi.  This led to the capture of the western part of Azerbaijan, including Tabriz. The Qara Qoyunlus become a great empire during the rule of Gara Yusif.  In a battle against the Timurids and Jalairis, Qara Yusif created a large state from Azerbaijan. This united Eastern Georgia, Arab Iraq and Ajam Iraq. Qara Iskander, the son of Qara Yusif, restored the rule of Kara Koyunlu in 1421. Sultan Shahrukh left Tabriz, he entered the city.  When Shah Rukh returned, all the lands he had captured were recaptured by Black Alexander.

According to the German Turkologist Gerhard Doerfere, it is very strange that the word "Turkmen" still confuses the Aq Qoyunlu and Qara Qoyunlu Turkmens.  The word Turkmen actually means "nomadic Oghuz. Aq Qoyunlu and Qara Qoyunlu" are Azerbaijanis

researchers associate the Oghuz dialect of Kara-Qoyunlu with the Azerbaijani language.  For example, Faruk Shumer recorded that the Eastern Oghuz dialect of Qara-Qoyunlu is called the Azerbaijani language today, and Muhsin Behramnejad named Azerbaijani language an inherited from Qara-Qoyunlu Turkmen tribes. Sultan Kara-Koyunlu 1435-1467 Jahan shah is the generally recognized representative of Azerbaijani poetry.

Doge (meme)

Doge ( , , ) is an Internet meme that became popular in 2013. The meme usually is of a picture of a Shiba Inu dog with multicolored text in Comic Sans font in the foreground. The text, representing a kind of internal monologue, is written in a form of broken English.

The Doge meme uses simple phrases with words like "so," "such," "many," "much," and "very," used in funny ways. It often ends with words like "wow," "amaze," or "excite." Variations include "liquified Doge," where the dog's shape changes, and "ironic Doge," where Doge is in weird situations. Other characters, like Cheems and Walter, show up too. Walter is a Bull Terrier who likes trucks. These memes are popular on places like r/dogelore on Reddit. One famous meme is "Swole Doge vs. Cheems," comparing a strong Doge to a baby Cheems.

Kabosu, a Shiba Inu born around November 2, 2005, was the original dog in the meme. She was sent to an animal shelter when her puppy mill closed down. In 2008, a kindergarten teacher named Atsuko Sato adopted her and named her after a fruit because of her round face. Another dog in the meme is Suki, owned by a photographer named Jonathan Fleming. Suki wore a shrunken scarf in a photo taken in February 2010.

Kabosu's first picture appeared in a 2010 blog post by Sato. Later, variations of her pictures with Comic Sans text became popular on Tumblr. The misspelled word "Doge" was used intentionally in 2005 in a puppet series. The meme became more popular after being used on Reddit in 2010.

Other characters in the meme are based on real dogs. Cheems is based on a dog named Balltze from Hong Kong, who passed away in 2023. Walter is based on a bull terrier named Nelson. Kabosu was reported to be ill with leukemia in December 2022, but her health improved afterward.

The word "Doge" is pronounced in different ways, such as DOHJ or DOHG. In some countries, it's pronounced as "dodge." People unfamiliar with the meme might say "doggie" or other variations like DOG-ay or DOH-gay.

Oldwick, New Jersey

Oldwick is a place in Hunterdon County in New Jersey. It is unincorporated territory. That means it is not officially a town.

The first European people to live in this place were English. In the early 1700s, they called their village Smithfield. People whose ancestors came from Germany moved there too. In the 1750s, they changed the name to "New Germantown." In 1918, the United States was at war with Germany, so the people in the town changed the name again.

Sebeos

Sebeos () was an Armenian historian and chronicler. He is well-known for the "History of Heraclius", which contains information about Roman–Persian Wars, the Muslim conquests as well as ancient Armenian legends such as Hayk.

Leonhard Seppala and his dog Togo travelled the longest and most dangerous part of the journey. But a musher named Gunnar Kaasen and Balto became the most famous because they did the last part.

An epidemic of diphtheria started in Nome, Alaska. It threatened the lives of many, mostly children. The medicine to treat the disease was called diphtheria antitoxin. Doctor Curtis Welch only had a supply of expired medicine. He had ordered more medicine in Juneau, but it did not arrive before the Bering Sea froze. Shortly after the last ship had left Nome before winter, a native American girl from the nearby village, Holy Cross, showed signes of diphteria. The doctor ruled out diphteria, and instrad said the child has tonsillitis. The child died about a day later. During the next weeks, three more children died. On January 20,1925, a three year old boy wa diagnosed with diphteria. Dr. welch didn't give the boy antitoxin, because the dose had expired, and he eared that it would weaken the boy too much. The boy died a day later. The next day, January, 21st, a seven year old girl was diagnosed. The doctor injected her 6.000 of the 8.000 units of antidote he had, even though they were past the expiration date. It did not help, the girl died the same day. 

The weather conditions made it very hard to deliver any new medicine. It was decided that dog sled teams were need to bring it to Nome.

Twenty mushers, and about 150 sled dogs travelled a distance of in fve and a half days. With this, they could save the town of Nome, and the areas around it from a dipheria epidemic. On January 21st, the town was placed under quarantine. 

There was a new popular medium, radio. It shoed both the mushers and their dogs as heroes. Newspapers also reported on the run. Balto, the lead sled dog on the final stretch into Nome became the most famous dog, of the era, after Rin Tin Tin. Statues of him in both New York City's Central Park and downtown Anchorage, Alaska are popular tourist attractions. But it was Togo's team which covered much of the most dangerous parts of the route. It also ran the farthest: Togo's team covered while Balto's team ran . The publicity also helped an inoculation campaign in the U.S. This dramatically reduced the threat of the disease,diphteria.

Conditions were very harsh: Often, temperatures were below . At first, the idea was to fly the serum to Nome, but there were no aircraft or pilots, that could fly in this bad weather. The aircraft available could only fly about half the distance, and there was no way to refill them.

Gift economy

A gift economy or gift culture is an economic model, where goods are not sold, but they are given away, without an explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards. There are social norms and customs about the exact way the gift is given. In a gift culture, gifts are not given in an explicit exchange of goods or services for money, or some other commodity or service. In contrast, in a barter economy or a market economy goods and services are exhanged for a received value, usually money. 

Anthropologists discussed the nature of gift economies. Research began with Bronisław Malinowski's description of the Kula ring in the Trobriand Islands during World War I. The Kula trade appeared to be gift-like because Trobrianders would travel great distances over dangerous seas to give what were considered valuable objects without any guarantee of a return. Malinkowski had a discussion with French anthropologist Marcel Mauss: This showed that gift economy was more complex that they first thought. They also introduced a number of technical terms to describe the different forms of exchange. Some of these terms are reciprocity, inalienable possessions, and presentation.

Anthropologists Maurice Bloch and Jonathan Parry think that the unsettled relationship between market and non-market exchange will attract most attention. Some authors argue that gift economies build community, while markets harm community relationships.

Some things that make gift exhange different from other forms of exhange. Usually, the idea of property, and property rights are different. Sometimes gifting forms a distinct "sphere of exchange" that is an "economic system". Giving a gift always establishes a social relationship. The nature of giving a gift in a market economy,is very different from "prestations" typical of non-market societies. Gift economies also differ from related phenomena, such as common property regimes and the exchange of non-commodified labour.

Potlatch is a celebration of native Americans of the Pacific Northwest. During the celebration, there is a ritual exchange of gifts. The value of the gifts demonstrates the wealth, power and influience of the person giving the gifts. Marcel Mauss saw this an example of a ruinous competition: The gifts often caused the ruin of the person giving them, or his tribe. That way, Potlatch was outlwawed in Canada, in late 19th century. There was a push to re-introduce the tradition in the 1950s.

The concept of a gift economy has played a large role in works of fiction about alternative societies, especially in works of science fiction. Examples include:

The city was founded by the Moabites in the thirteenth century BC, as it was part of their kingdom extending east of the Jordan River. Successively, many civilizations ruled the region

Madaba played a prominent role after it was occupied by the Byzantines because it included a number of its important historical churches. Until now, the city is considered one of the most important places for the followers of the Christian faith, due to the presence of these religious monuments. Located in its vicinity are many archaeological sites and holy places represented by Christian pilgrimage sites such as Al-Maghtas, Mount Nebo, Mukawar and Umm al-Rasas, which makes it a destination for tourists. 

The importance of Madaba in the early centuries of Christianity was similar to the importance of the city of Jerusalem as the most important center of Christian life in Transjordan, where it was mentioned in the Bible.

It was destroyed as a result of the violent earthquake that struck the region in 749, and other earthquakes that followed. But the Christian Arab tribes from the Karak region revived and settled them starting in 1880 AD, where it is inhabited today by Christians and Muslims alike.

Madaba is very famous for its mosaics art, and for its special heritage within its alleys; ancient Byzantine churches, mosques and unique architecture. It also contains the only institute in the world to teach the mosaics art. It is sometimes referred to as the "city of mosaics". The map of Madaba is one of the most important mosaic monuments in the city.

Nabataean Kingdom

The Nabataeans (169 BC - 106 AD) (), also named Nabatea (), was an ancient Arab kingdom in the deserts of Jordan, Sinai, the Negev and parts of the northern Arabian Peninsula. Their capital was the city of Petra in Jordan.

It was a strategic stop on the Incense Road; it is located at the crossroads of the caravan routes coming from Yemen, linking it to the Levant, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.

The Nabataeans relied on the caravan trade, enriched and established an important kingdom, and wrote in Aramaic, which they took from the Edomites. Aramaic was the language of trade in western Asia since the beginning of the first millennium BC, and it also became the language of the Achaemenid Persian court. The Nabataeans used to speak Arabic among themselves.

They had little interest in the scattered series of oases that were within their kingdom, they practiced limited agriculture, and their frontiers with the desert were not effectively secured; they lost their independence during the reign of the Roman Emperor Trajan.

The Nabataeans were able to take advantage of the location of their country for the passage of the arteries of trade between the Levant and Yemen, and they also mediated the transfer of trade between Egypt, the Levant and other places of the Arabian Peninsula. They imposed taxes on trades and merchants.

The port of Gaza was a favorite, due to its proximity to Petra. In addition, they built irrigation canals, took care of agriculture, exploited their land and the natural resources in it, learned and mastered the exploitation of copper and iron mines, minted money, and accumulated great fortunes as a result of their economic prosperity.

Baqa'a refugee camp

The Baqa'a refugee camp () is the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan, and it is one of the six “emergency” camps that were established in 1968 with the aim of accommodating Palestinian refugees and displaced persons who left the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a result of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.

The camp is located on the northwestern border of the Jordanian capital, Amman, 20 kilometers north of Amman on the “Amman-Irbid” road, near the Sweileh area. It is affiliated with the Ain Al-Basha in the Balqa Governorate. 

In the period between June 1967 and February 1968, refugees and displaced persons were accommodated in temporary camps in the Jordan Valley area, but they were transferred when military operations escalated in the area.

When al-Baqa'a camp was established, it was a large camp, with 5,000 tents designated to accommodate 26,000 refugees over an area of 1.4 square kilometres. Between 1969 and 1971, UNRWA replaced the tents with a total of 8,000 pre-built houses in order to protect people from the harsh winter conditions in Jordan. Since then, most of the residents have built stronger and more durable concrete housing.

The land of the camp is owned by the Al-Wareikat (Al-Adwan) clan, and the Jordanian government leased it to UNRWA. In 1950, UNRWA set up tents for the displaced in the areas called "Palestinian camps" on government land and private land leased or acquired by the Jordanian government from its owners. The camp is surrounded by agricultural lands irrigated by groundwater. In the eighties, the Baqa’a basin was classified as the second largest area in agricultural production after the Jordan Valley, where there were approximately 5,000 greenhouses, but now, after legalizing the use of groundwater, it has become the fifth area in agricultural production.

Seven dirty words

American comedian George Carlin (1937 – 2008) first made a list of seven obscene English language words during a 1972 monologue ("The Seven Words You Can't Say on Television"). The seven words were "motherfucker", "tits", "shit", "piss", "fuck", "cunt" and "cocksucker".

In the 1970s, these words were called inappropriate, obscene, and indecent on the United States' public airwaves. The terms were almost never used in scripted material. The broadcast standards in many parts of the world are different. Across the United States, a lot of the words on Carlin's original list are still not allowed in broadcast television or radio.

In a concert in 1966, the comedian Lenny Bruce said he was arrested when he said nine words in his sketch: "ass", "balls", "cocksucker", "cunt", "fuck", "motherfucker", "piss", "shit" and "tits".

Right after performing the routines at Summerfest in Milwaukee in 1972, Carlin was charged with disturbance of the peace and was arrested. The following year, on his album "Occupation: Toole", Carlin had a similar routine called "Filthy Words". The New York City radio station WBAI broadcast uncensored versions of the routine on October 30, 1973.

Dryophytes

Dryophytes is a genus of tree frogs in the family Hylidae. Most of the frogs live in North America, but some live in eastern Asia.

All frogs in "Dryophytes" are small and can climb trees. Most of them are green or gray in color. They have disks on the ends of their toes for climbing. The disks help them stick to the trees as they climb.

These tree frogs live in wetlands and in forests where the seasons change. They live on the ground and in trees.

Scientists have changed their minds about whether this is its own genus and how these frogs are related to other frogs:

Fitzinger first described (formally wrote about) this genus in 1843. In 1882 scientist George Albert Boulenger, moved it to the genus "Hyla", the true tree frogs. In 2014 Fouquette and Dubois wrote that "Dryophytes" was a subgenus inside "Hyla". In 2016, William E. Duellman and his team wrote that scientists should start using "Dryophytes" as its own genus again.

The true difference between frogs in "Dryophytes" and "Hyla" is where they live. Scientists do not think they have important differences in their bodies. "Hyla" frogs live in the Old World, which is Africa and Eurasia, and most "Dryophytes" frogs live in the New World, which is the Americas.

Only three "Dryophytes" frogs live anywhere but North America: "D. immaculata", "D. japonica", and "D. suweonensis" live in Asia.

The genus "Dryophytes" has 20 species of frogs in it.

Gray tree frog

The northern tree toad, changeable tree toad, chameleon hyla, chameleon tree toad, common tree toad, common tree frog, dusky tree toad, rain toad, eastern common tree frog, gray tree frog, or eastern gray tree frog ("Dryophytes versicolor") is a frog that lives in the North America. It lives in the United States and Canada. It lives as far west as Texas, as far east as Virginia and as far north as Ontario.

The adult male frog is 3.1 to 5.1 cm long from nose to rear end, and the adult female frog is 3.3 to 6.0 cm long. This frog can change color. It does this to make itself harder to see. Scientists call this metachrosis. This frog can be light green, gray-green, brown, or dark brown in color. It takes the frog about half an hour to change from one color to another. There is a white or olive spot under each eye. Some of these frogs have a white spot on their backs. There is orange-yellow color on their legs. The yellow only shows when the frog jumps. Scientists call this "flash" color.

The female frog lays 30-40 eggs at a time. The tadpoles can breathe by sucking bubbles down from the surface. Older tadpoles jump out of the water to breathe like a whale.

This frog climbs very high into the trees to look for food. It spends time high in the tree's canopy.

This frog can survive being frozen.

Common tree frog (disambiguation)

There are many animals called common tree frog:


Canopy (biology)

A canopy or forest canopy is part of a tree, forest, group of trees, or group of other tall plants. It is where the leaves spread out like a roof or umbrella.

The canopy is where the most sunlight touches the plants, so it is where the most energy enters living things. It is also where the most gas exchange happens, where oxygen and carbon dioxide and water vapor go in and out of the leaves. Many animals live in the canopy.

The Bad Guys (book series)

The Bad Guys is a book series of graphic novels written by Aaron B.
The "Bad Guys" are a group of anthropomorphic criminals who try to do good things to change peoples' perception on them, despite their efforts usually going wrong.

In the following table:




On July 22, 2017, Australia's "The Daily Telegraph" reported that several studios had expressed interest in adapting the series into a film. In March 2018, "Variety" reported that DreamWorks Animation would develop a film based on the book series, with Etan Cohen writing the screenplay. The following year, in October, it was reported that the film would be directed by Pierre Perifel in his feature directorial debut. The film was described as having "a similar twist on the heist genre that "Shrek" did on fairy tales, and what "Kung Fu Panda" did for the kung fu genre". The crew worked remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On July 28, 2021, the cast was announced with Etan Cohen, Patrick Hughes, and author Aaron Blabey set to serve as executive producers for the film. 

On October 7, 2019, it was reported that the film would be theatrically released on September 17, 2021, taking over the release date of "Spooky Jack". In December 2020, the film was delayed with "" taking its original slot, though it was confirmed that it would get a new date "within the coming weeks" due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2021, the release date was scheduled to April 15, 2022. In October 2021, it was pushed back again by one week to April 22. The film is slated to stream in the United States on the Peacock streaming service 45 days after its theatrical release, followed by its Netflix debut after Peacock's 4-month exclusive window. On March 1, 2022, Universal pulled the release in Russia in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

A CG sequel short based on the film, "The Bad Guys in Maraschino Ruby", was announced in the Blu-ray and Digital release with a story made and directed by head of story Nelson Yokota and produced by Angie Howard while executive produced by Pierre Perifel, Damon Ross, Rebecca Huntley and Michael Vollman.

A holiday special inspired by the characters from the film is being produced by DreamWorks Animation Television and will be directed by Bret Haaland from "Fast & Furious Spy Racers" and executive produced by Haaland and Katherina Nolfi from "Abominable and the Invisible City" and "Spirit Riding Free". The holiday special will be aired in 2023 on Netflix.

Arithmetic progression

In mathematics, an arithmetic progression, or arithmetic sequence, is a sequence with the property that the difference between the two terms which follow one another is constant. This is different from a geometric progression, where the ratio of change between two terms is constant. 
If the initial term of an arithmetic progression is formula_1 and the common difference of successive members is formula_2, then the formula_3-th term of the sequence (formula_4) is given by:
A finite portion of an arithmetic progression is called a finite arithmetic progression and sometimes just called an arithmetic progression. The sum of a finite arithmetic progression is called an arithmetic series.

Balanced ternary

Balanced ternary is a type of numbering system. It is based on base 3.

The most common numbering system in use today is base 10, or decimal. With decimal, there are ten digits. these are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. In ternary only 0, 1 and 2 are used. Balanced ternary is similar, but instead of using 0, 1 and 2, the numbers -1, 0 and 1 are used. The letter T is used to mean -1.

As with all numbering systems, each place is equal to the number Multiplied by the system's base raised to that positions location. For example with the base 10 number 1234, the value is 1x 10 (1000) + 2 x 10 (100) + 3 x 10 (10) + 4 x 10.(1) In base 3, these same values would be 27, 9, 3 and 1.

The benefits of using balanced ternary is that it is possible to write down numbers less than zero without the need to say whether a number is positive or negative. Another benefit is that when it comes to computers, there are much fewer rounding errors.

Vantablack could be used to paint something so black that a flat circle would look like a deep hole. Other artists were angry with Kapoor because they wanted to use this paint too. One artist, Stuart Semple, made other paints, for example "Pinkest Pink" and "Better Black", and wrote on his website that Kapoor could not have any.

Chodov (Sokolov District)

Chodov (; ) is a town in Sokolov District in the Karlovy Vary Region of the Czech Republic. It has a population of about 13,000 people.

Chodov was originally a Slavic settlement. Its name comes from an old Slavic term "choda", which means a road. The Slavic colonisation was not successful and in the Middle Ages this part of Bohemia was colonised by Germans. In the 12th–13th century Chodov belongs to the monastery in Waldsassen and in the 14th–17th century is ruled locally from Loket. In 1894 Chodov is declared a town and gets the right to use its own coat of arms.

From 1938 to 1945 it was one of the municipalities in Sudetenland. Until the end of World War II the town was inhabited practically only by Germans, who were exiled from Czechoslovakia after the war. In the '60s a big chemical factory was built 4 km from Chodov in Vřesová and then new districts were built for the Czech and Slovak workers who moved here.

The most significant is Church of St. Lawrence, built by the constructor Brauenbock according to the plans of the architect Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer. On the main shrine there is a painting by the famous Czech-German artist Peter Johann Brandl. In front of the church we find a 17th-century statue of St. Sebastian and on the main square a statue of the Virgin Mary (1675). The other church in the town belongs to the Protestants, Czech Brethren. Close to the gate of the Protestant church there is a monument to war victims. It was re-erected in 1998 exactly 100 years after its first erection.


Chodov is twinned with:

Continued fraction

A continued fraction is a concept from mathematics and number theory. It is written as an integer, plus a fraction. The numerator of the fraction, is again an integer, and for the denominator, the rule repeats. Every real number can be expressed as a continued fraction. While it is possible to use continued fractions for calculations, they are used to find approximations for irrational numbers. 

Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange first formalized the concept, even though it was used before.

Joe Burrow

Joseph Lee Burrow (born December 10, 1996) is an American quarterback who plays for the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals. He started his college career as a backup quarterback for the Ohio State Buckeyes, before transferring to Louisiana State University (LSU). During his senior year at LSU, he passed for over 5,600 yards and 60 touchdowns, and was awarded the Heisman Trophy. He also led the Tigers to an undefeated season and College Football National Championship.

After college, he was drafted first overall by the Bengals in 2020. He led the Bengals to an appearance in Super Bowl LVI.

Joseph Lee Burrow was born in Ames, Iowa on December 10, 1996, the son of Robin and Jim Burrow. Jim is a former football player and coach whose career lasted over 40 years. Burrow was born in Ames when his father was on the staff for the Iowa State Cyclones. Joe's family is notably involved in sports. According to a 2019 "Sports Illustrated" story, "the Burrow athletic lineage dates back nearly a century."

From 2011–2014, Burrow attended Athens High School in The Plains, Ohio, leading the school to three straight playoff appearances and the school's first seven playoff victories in school history. During his high school career, he passed for 11,416 yards and 157 touchdowns, while also rushing for 2,067 yards with 27 rushing touchdowns. He was awarded the state's Mr. Football Award and Gatorade Player of the Year award as a senior in 2014. He and his Bulldog teammates went 14–1 that season. During high school, Burrow also played basketball at a high level and was named first-team all-state at point guard his senior year. Burrow was rated as a four-star football recruit, and was the eighth-highest ranked dual-threat quarterback in the class of 2015 according to the 247SportsmComposite. On May 27, 2014, he committed to Ohio State University to play football for the Buckeyes.

Joe Burrow played college football at Ohio State University for the Buckeyes. He was a redshirt freshman in 2015, meaning he did not play his first year of college. He was then a backup to J. T. Barrett for the next two years. During that time, he played in 10 games, completing 29-of-39 pass attempts for 287 yards and two touchdowns. Dwayne Haskins was then named the starting quarterback for the Buckeyes. Because of this, Burrow decided to transfer to Louisiana State University (LSU) to play for the Tigers. Burrow graduated from Ohio State in three years with a degree in consumer and family financial services, and would be immediately eligible as a graduate transfer.

In his first year as a Tiger, in 2018, Burrow was named the starter as a redshirt junior. He earned 2 SEC Player of the Week honors during the season. The Tigers finished the season with a 10–3 record. Burrow has 2,894 passing yards and 16 passing touchdowns to 5 interceptions. While rushing the football, Burrow had 399 yards and 7 touchdowns.

The following season, Burrow had what many sportswriters and football experts described as the best season by a college quarterback. In a blowout win against Texas A&M, Burrow set the single-season Southeastern Conference (SEC) record in passing yards and tied the single-season record for passing touchdowns. The following week, Burrow led the Tigers to a 37–10 win in the SEC Championship Game against the Georgia Bulldogs, securing the Tigers' place in the College Football Playoff. He was named the game's Most Valuable Player (MVP) and during the win, Burrow set the single-season SEC record for passing touchdowns. Later, on December 14, 2019, Burrow was awarded the 2019 Heisman Trophy, winning the award by a record-margin of votes.

In the playoff semifinal game at the 2019 Peach Bowl, Burrow led the Tigers to a 63–28 win over the fourth-ranked Oklahoma Sooners. In the win, Burrow completed 29-of-39 pass attempts for 493 passing yards and seven passing touchdowns, to go along with five rushes for 22 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown. Burrow's eight total touchdowns were an FBS bowl game record and SEC single game record, and were recorded in just over one half of play before Burrow was rested. Analysts have called Burrow's performance one of the greatest in college football history. 
In the 2020 College Football Playoff National Championship Game against Clemson, Burrow threw for 463 yards and five passing touchdowns. Burrow also ran for a touchdown in the game and was named the game's offensive MVP, as he led LSU to a 42–25 victory. With the win, LSU finished with an undefeated 15–0 season.

He finished his 2019 season with 60 passing touchdowns, which set the single-season NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) record. Burrow's record has since been passed by Bailey Zappe of Western Kentucky, who threw for 62 touchdowns in 2021. Burrow also set a new FBS single-season record in combined passing and rushing touchdowns, with 65. Zappe tied this record in 2021. Burrow also finished the year with 5,671 passing yards, which is tied for fourth all-time in an FBS season. His passer rating of 202 for the season was also a record until it was passed by Mac Jones in 2020.

After his first year at LSU, Burrow was not expected to be a first-round NFL Draft pick. However, after his senior season, Burrow became the heavy favorite to be picked first overall. A "Draft Network" analysis of Burrow's skill set before the draft complimented Burrow for his "elite football intelligence," but stated Burrow doesn't have "elite arm strength and throwing power." Their final evaluation stated:

The Cincinnati Bengals would indeed draft Burrow first overall in the 2020 NFL Draft. Burrow signed his four-year rookie contract, worth $36.1 million, on July 31, 2020. During the off-season and the preseason, Burrow was thought to be the favorite to win the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award.

Burrow was the only rookie quarterback from his draft class to start in the first week of the 2020 season. In his first game, Burrow threw for 193 passing yards and an interception, and rushed for 46 yards and a touchdown in a 16–13 loss against the Los Angeles Chargers. In their next game, the Bengals went against the Cleveland Browns. In the game, Burrow threw his first career passing touchdown, a 23-yard pass to tight end C. J. Uzomah. The Bengals lost the game 35–30, but Burrow set an NFL rookie record for pass completions, with 37. In Week 4 of the season, Burrow earned his first career win as he led the Bengals over the Jacksonville Jaguars. It was also his third straight game throwing for 300 or more passing yards, making him the first rookie quarterback to do so.

In the second half of a Week 11 game against the Washington Football Team, Burrow was hit while throwing a pass. This caused tears to his ACL and MCL in his left knee, among other damage to his PCL and meniscus. He was later placed on injured reserve, ending his rookie season. Even while injured, Burrow was noted to continue preparing for games by watching game film. He finished his rookie season with a 2–7–1 record as a starter, 2,688 passing yards, and 13 passing touchdowns to 5 interceptions. He also rushed for 142 yards and 3 touchdowns during the season.

In Week 4, Burrow completed 25-of-32 passes for 348 yards and two touchdowns in a 24–21 win over the Jaguars. His performance earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week. Against the division rival Baltimore Ravens in Week 16, Burrow completed 37-of-46 passes as he threw for a career-high and franchise record 525 passing yards. Burrow also threw for four touchdowns and finished the game with a career-high 143.2 passer rating, as his strong performance in the game helped the Bengals win 41–21. 

During the season, Burrow's play was noted by football coaches and sportswriters as being impressive and having improved greatly. In December 2021, Charlie Goldsmith of "The Cincinnati Enquirer" wrote:

The Bengals finished the regular season with a 10–7 record. They also finished as the winners of their AFC North Division.

In 2020 they receive the award for the "Best Adaptation of a Traditional Piece" in the XIX Opinión de Música de Raíz Awards. Contrapunto is also recognized as one of the best records in the World Music Charts Europe.

In his works of the year 2021, an evolution is perceived towards the fusion between traditional music and sounds close to trap and electronic music.

Female submission

Certain women will submit to their partner. In this case the woman will allow her partner to use her body for his sexual pleasure. Very often, the activity is associated with BDSM, the S in BDSM can stand for submission. This practice is known as female submission or femsub. The submission is consensual, the woman wants to submit, and also gets sexual pleasure from doing so. Usually, submission requires a degree of trust. The partner the woman submits to (called 'dominant') is a man, most of the time. There are setups where there may be more than one dominant partner. The woman may also get emotional gratification from submitting and giving control to her trusted partner.

A 1985 study suggested that about three out of ten people taking part in BDSM activities were women. A 2015 study indicates that 61.7% of females who are active in BDSM preferred a submissive role, 25.7% consider themselves a switch (they take both roles), while 12.6% prefer the dominant role. In contrast, 46.6% of men prefer the submissive role, 24% consider themselves to be switches and 29.5% prefer the dominant role.

Submission can take different forms. One form is to be passive and to do what the partner wants. This may mean that the partner is able to start all sexual activities, and to control the sex positions used. It can also be about the type of sexual activities the partners do: Not all foreplay leads to coitus (anal sex, sexual roleplay or BDSM doesn't). In some cases, the woman needs to be passive, while the man performs a sex act on her. Letting the partner do that can also be seen as a form of submission. Doing what the partner says may be a part of a sexual roleplay or activity, and can also be in the relation to the style of dress, if any, or behavior or any other manner. Anything, where the woman is passive can be seen as submissive behaviour. As an example, the woman will let her lover undress her.

Submission can show in different ways: In all cases, the woman gives up sexual or personal control to another person. Examples are acts of servitude, submission to humiliation or punishment such as erotic spanking, or other activities, at times in association with bondage. Female submission can take the form of engaging in sexual activity with a person other than her normal partner, as in the case of swinging, non-monogamy or prostitution. Some women choose to include occasional sexual submission in an otherwise conventional sex life. For example, a woman may adopt a submissive role during a sexual activity to overcome a sexual inhibition she may have. A woman may choose to submit full-time, becoming a lifestyle slave.

Some people get erotic pleasure from their sex partner acting in a submissive manner. For them i is a turn-on. Other people regard obvious passivity as a form of feminine flirting or seduction. Some women submit to the sexual wishes of their partner for the pleasure of the partner, which may itself result in sexual pleasure for the submissive woman.

Female submission and conquest are very common themes in traditional literature. When they are married, many man see their wives as subordinate; in that view, a woman is defenseless in society, and has to submit to men.

"Story of O", published in 1954 in French, is an erotic tale of female submission involving a beautiful Parisian fashion photographer named O, who is taught to be constantly available for all forms of sex, offering herself to any male.

Wonder Woman's original key weakness was permitting herself to be bound by a man. While this exploitable weakness has since been retconned out of continuity by DC comics, it was absolutely key to the character Dr. Marston, an ardent feminist and practicing psychologist, was creating. His point was that women are not actually inferior to men, they are oppressed. The only reason they are "weaker" is because they allow men to make them so.

Pine Barrens (New Jersey)

The Pine Barrens or Pinelands are a place in New Jersey in the eastern United States. They are in the southern part of the state. Sometimes the word "Pinelands" only means the Pinelands Natural Reserve.

The Pinelands Natural Reserve is a large part of the Pine Barrens. It is 1.1 million acres in size. They are 22 percent of all New Jersey's area. Not all of the Pine Barrens are in the Pinelands Natural Reserve.

The United States Congress made the Pine Barrens Natural Reserve in 1988.

Because there is so much sand and acid in the soil, people did not want to make farms in the Pine Barrens. But the water in the Pine Barrens was very pure. Sea captains liked to take water from the Pine Barrens with them on long trips because it did not go bad quickly. The iron in the soil and tannin chemicals from the cedar trees kept bacteria from turning the water bad.

Sometimes the Atlantic white cedar trees die. This is because salt water rises into the Pine Barrens. It has happened many times, but the trees eventually come back. Scientists think that climate change might mean the trees will die and not grow back.

Some of the people who moved to the Pine Barrens in the 1700s were Quakers who had fought in the American Revolution. The other Quakers had thrown them out because Quakers are not supposed to kill other human beings. British loyalists also came to the Pine Barrens in the 1700s. Outlaws and other criminals came too.

In 1913, Elizabeth Kite wrote about the pine barrens, saying the people there were uneducated and many were criminals. Later, she said she regretted writing this because instead of helping the people in the pine barrens, newspapers made things worse.

In 1954, the Chatsworth Fire burned 19,500 acres of the Pine Barrens.

People in the Pine Barrens made charcoal, glass, cabinets, paper, and bricks. In the 1800s and 1900s, people came to the Pine Barrens to find jobs.

Legends say that a creature called the Jersey Devil lives in the Pine Barrens.

Pine barrens

Pine barrens are a type of habitat. It is a place where a few pine trees grow. A pine barren does not have enough trees to be a forest. A pine barren is one type of savannah. There are pine barrens in the eastern half of North America, in the United States and Canada.

The soil in a pine barren has a lot of acid and sand in it. Water flows through the soil instead of staying in it. Pine barren soil does not make good farms.

Because pine barrens have fires, droughts, and frost during the growing season, the trees never grow enough to form a canopy. They never form a "roof" that stops the sunlight. That means that sunlight can touch the ground in a pine barren. That means that small plants that need a lot of light can grow there.

The trees in pine barrens can be jack pine, pitch pine, red pine, and some white pine. Northern pin oak, black cherry, and aspen can grow in pine barrens, but these trees do not grow as tall as they do in other places. Many shrubs, grasses, and ferns also grow in pine barrens. For example, there can be blueberries, bracken fern, and reindeer lichen. Most of the plants in the pine barren have some special thing or ability that helps them with fire. For example, the pitch pine has thick bark. Its cones open when they are near fire.

Many animals without bones live in pine barrens. For example, there are butterflies and grasshoppers. Birds that eat these animals live there too.

Pine barrens form where the ground is not too steep. For example, they form in glacial plains, outwash plains, and lakeplains.

Human beings can hurt pine barrens by cutting down the pine trees for wood, by bringing plants from other parts of the world there, and by stopping the natural fires. When human beings stop fires, other types of trees can grow in the pine barren, and it becomes a forest instead. Then, the small plants that need a lot of sunlight die.

Alex Parent

Alexander A. (Alex) Parent was a trade union official and, for one term, was a member of the Ontario Legislative Assembly.

Parent was president of United Auto Workers Local 195 in Windsor, Ontario in the 1940s, and a supporter of the Communist Party of Canada, which at the time was known as the Labor-Progressive Party. In the 1945 Ontario general election, Parent was nominated by the UAW-CIO as one of three Labour candidates in the election. Parent ran in Essex North, George Burt, the UAW's Canadian director, ran in Windsor-Walkerville and Windsor mayor Arthur Reaume ran in Windsor—Sandwich. All three were jointly nominated by the Communist Labor-Progressive Party and the Ontario Liberal Party and ran as Liberal-Labour candidates and targeted ridings held by the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation.
Parent was elected, and initially sat with the Liberal Party but quit the Liberal group in the legislature in January 1946 in order to sit as a "straight Labor representative", working and voting with Labor-Progressive MPPs J.B. Salsberg and A. A. MacLeod.

He remained president of Local 195 until March 1946 when he defeated by Earl Watson by 2,200 votes to 1,600 votes.

Parent did not run in the 1948 Ontario general election, and his riding was re-taken by the CCF.
He died on December 25, 1961, at the age of 53.

Sitting in the studio, and unaware of the accident, Myers was asked to fill in and present the programme instead. He did it so well that he was hired as a broadcaster at the station. He became the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation's top radio personality and the favourite radio voice of Ghana's first president, Kwame Nkrumah. While in Accra, organized a weekly discotheque session that helped popularize rock and roll in the capital and also directed the country's first musical and helped found what became the country's national theatre. During the Congo Crisis he and friends went to Katanga to entertain United Nations peacekeepers in the Congo. Later, Myers was part of a troupe that included an orchestra, and 85 dancers that was sent to Moscow to perform.

On the strength of his success at Radio Ghana, he was hired in 1963 by the BBC External Service (BBC World Service since 1965) as the first host of "Good Morning Africa" for the BBC African Service. On the programme, he "anarchically scattered jokes, competitions and fictional guests like the American Vietnam commander ‘General Wastemoreland’ between the ‘pop, politics and personalities’ of the programme’s sub-title." Myers's success gave him celebrity in Africa, with fans gathering in the thousands to greet him at airports.

Myers was in the cohort of DJs who launched BBC Radio 1 in 1967 sharing duties with Terry Wogan presenting "Late Night Extra", while also continuing on the BBC Africa Service. He was constrained on his Radio 1 show by the station's restrictive playlist and policies, denying him the on air freedom he had on the World Service. He also began presenting a weekend programme on BBC Africa, "PM", named after his initials, where he would interview celebrities such as Shirley Bassey, Carol Channing, David Lean, Stephen Sondheim, Ingrid Bergman, and Sophia Loren. In the early 1970s, the success of "Good Morning Africa" promoted the World Service to make it the flagship morning programme across the English section as "The Good Morning Show", also presented by Myers.

He left the BBC in 1974, after 11 years, and moved to Beirut, Lebanon where he opened a nightclub, the Crazy Horse Saloon, only to close it down a few weeks later when the Lebanese Civil War broke out. He moved to Turkey, where he attempted to start another nightclub, before returning to broadcasting in 1976 when he joined Radio Netherlands, where he produced and presented English-language documentaries, features, and other programming aimed at Africa and Asia, as well as for the English section generally, presenting and producing programmes such as "Afroscene", "Mainstream Asia", "Asiascan", "Rembrandt Express", and "50+". From 1993 to 1995 he hosted Radio Netherland's venerable "Happy Station Show".

He died at 59 of cancer and complications from AIDS.

She was hired to be their foreign correspondent in Jerusalem, but was instead made co-host of "The 700 Club" days after arriving at CBN's headquarters in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Reflecting on her experiences, she wrote: "But no one ever asked me about my politics. I was converted by association from my liberal democratic feminism to conservative Republican fundamentalism. I felt like a wolf in sheep’s clothing adapting somewhat awkwardly to becoming one of the sheep."

She was the first journalist to report the story of the John Anthony Walker spy ring. She interviewed Walker's daughter, Laura Walker Snyder, for CBN. During the interview, Snyder explained how her father had allegedly intimidated and manipulated his children into becoming spies.

She married Swedish businessman Kai Soderberg in 1983, six months after joining "The 700 Club". Soderman was a suicidal alcoholic and the two eventually divorced after she moved back to California. She was fired by Robertson in 1988 after he learned that Soderman had previously been twice married and divorced.

She stopped being a Christian after her experiences at CBN and returned to San Diego where she hosted "Danuta Time", on KSDO radio in the late 1980s and a news commentator on KUSI-TV in the early 1990s.

Her most recent book is "Libertas", the first book in a trilogy (three-book series) called "A Pocket Full of Seeds", which is a 19th century historical fiction about runaway slaves who took the difficult journey on the Oregon Trail to seek freedom in the Northwest of the United States.

Frederick McMahon

Frederick Joseph McMahon (1914 - March 6, 1988) was a Canadian politician and lawyer. He was a public official in Ontario. As a lawyer, McMahon was best known for defending the bank robber Edwin Alonzo Boyd and his brother Norman in their 1952 trials. He was also reeve of North York, Ontario. Later, he was a provincial judge.

McMahon was first elected to North York township council in January 1950. In 1952, he ran against reeve Nelson Boylen. He defeated Boylen in an upset victory by more than 1,500 votes. In the campaign, he promised to bring industry to the mostly rural municipality. He also promised to expand the municipal government to match North York's population growth since the war.

McMahon feared that North York was facing bankruptcy. This caused him to support the province's proposal to join with the city of Toronto and its 12 surrounding townships and villages to create Metropolitan Toronto in 1953.

Norman Goodhead

Norman Charles Goodhead (August 26, 1917 – October 3, 2009) was a Canadian municipal politician in Metropolitan Toronto. He was reeve of North York township, a municipality in the Metro Toronto federation, from 1959 to 1964 and was a candidate to be Reeve of the Township of North York, Ontario from 1959 to 1964 and was twice a leading candidate to be Chairman of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, a position elected by the Metropolitan Toronto Council.

He was born and raised in the Cabbagetown, Toronto neighbourhood before moving to the suburb of North York as an adult. He was elected to the North York Township Council in 1956 and then as its reeve (the equivalent of mayor) in 1958, while the suburb was experiencing a boom in development as its population grew.

Goodhead campaigned in favour of increasing North York's representation on Metro Council and for the creation of a Board of Control to better manage the suburb.

In office, he crusaded against illegal basement apartments and the subdivision of single family homes into multi-tenant units and utilized the township's resources to evict up to 1,000 tenants of these properties. Albert Campbell, reeve of the neighbouring suburb of Scarborough, criticized Goodhead's actions: "imagine talking about sending township officials into private homes and padlocking them, then ordering workmen to rip out plumbing and the like."

He also criticized the construction of the proposed lakeshore expressway in Toronto, a major project of Metro, saying, "the Gardiner Expressway will someday be a monument to stupidity."

In 1962, he ran for the position of Metro Chairman to succeed Fred Gardiner but lost to City of Toronto Controller William R. Allen, winning 10 votes to Allen's 14.

In 1964, Goodhead ran for a fourth term as reeve but was defeated by James Ditson Service, who accused Goodhead of authoritarianism and ran against him as a reformer. He also accused Goodhead of being in a conflict of interest as North York's garbage disposal contract was with a private business operated by Goodhead.

Goodhead ran for Metro Chairman a second time in 1969, but he was no longer a sitting Metro Councillor and was considered the frontrunner, and led on the first ballot before being defeated on the third ballot by Scarborough mayor Albert Campbell, 21–11.

He was a mentor to Paul Godfrey, whose mother managed Goodhead's election campaigns, and who would succeed Campbell as Metro Chairman in 1975. When Goodhead died, Godfrey eulogized him as "one of the original people that got North York out of the short-pants era to becoming a full-fledged municipality."

Goodhead was a successful businessman outside of politics, and sold his waste disposal firm to a US company for $12.5 million in 1972. He also owned two landfill sites, one of which was the largest in Canada.

Evangelos Zappas

Evangelis or Evangelos Zappas (; ; 23 August 1800 – 19 June 1865) was a Greek patriot, philanthropist and businessman who established the modern Olympic Games.

Evangelis Zappas was born to a Greek family on August 23, 1800 in the village of Labovo in the Ottoman Empire. His parents were Vasileios and Sotira Zappas. Zappas received no education during his youth. At 13, he left his village and worked as a mercenary in the Ottoman militia of Ali Pasha. Zappas was involved in the Filiki Eteria, a Greek patriotic organization, and served in the Greek War of Independence when it started in 1821. He claimed to have been wounded five times during the war. Zappas later moved to Wallachia in 1831 and made a fortune in land and agriculture. In the 1850s, Zappas became one of the wealthiest businessmen in Eastern Europe. The value of his whole fortune was calculated at six million gold drachmas.

Zappas was a nationalist inspired to revive the Olympic Games by Panagiotis Soutsos, a Greek poet. He sent a letter in 1856 to King Otto of Greece offering to pay to restore the Olympics. The first modern Olympic Games were held on November 15, 1859 in Athens, Greece. And just like in the ancient Olympics, the athletes competed in running, discus throwing, javelin throwing, wrestling, jumping, and pole-climbing. Zappas died on June 19, 1865 with no children. His money was used for developing athletic buildings in Athens, as well as for continuing the Olympic Games. He left instructions for the building of the Zappeion Exhibition and Conference Center named in both his honour and in the honour of his cousin, Konstantinos Zappas.

Evangelos Zappas made several donations to Greek schools, libraries and scholarships. He also financed the Romanian Academy where he has a statue there today. Zappas also funded a Romanian dictionary, a newspaper and books in the Albanian language, and research on the history of the Romanian people.

Early live

Social cleansing

In certain societies there are groups of people, who think that certain people should not be part of that society. These people who are seen as "undesirable" are then either killed, or they are driven away. This is known as social cleansing. Examples of such groups seen as undesirable are homeless people, street children, criminals,the elderly, and people with disabilities. Very often, these ideas also touch sex workers, people who are homosexual, or who have a gender identity outside the clearly defined male, or clearly defined female spectrum. Wanting to do social cleansing is caused by a combination of economic and social factors, but killings are mostly present in regions with high levels of poverty or were there are very few very rich, and the rest of the poulation is poor. Perpetrators are usually of the same community as the victims. Very often, they think that the victims are a drain on the resources of society. Efforts by national and local governments to stop these killings have been largely ineffective. The government and police forces are often involved in the killings, especially in South America.

According to the National Center of Historic Memory the city of Cali in Colombia is most affected by these massacres. Between 1998 and 2013, about 5.000 people have been killed in social cleansing operations; 77% of the cillings were done by special groups doing the cleansing, 18% were killed by paramilitary groups, and 5% were killed by unidentified groups.

A report by Vice News states that the police is often involved, and leads to the homeless seeking shelter in the most remote areas of the canalisation: "They come here all the time. they get you and take you to the police station. There they beat youu up, and they sprinkle you with a strong water jet. They tell you you are good for social cleansing, but they don't tell you when it will happen. 
When the aggressors cannot reach them, they have another stategy: they put gasoline in the sewers, and put it on fire. "Six month ago, paramilitary forces came, and put a small girl on fire. They poured gasoline on her and lit her."

After the civil war in Guatemala, many soldiers formed criminal organizations. That way, they could avoid that a efficient transition government would be put in place, which would persecute people who had committed war crimes.. The process of transition towards a democratic government also threatened these groups, who then executed people who were politically active. A very notable example is the assasination of the bishop Juan José Gerardi Conedera. A commander of a military base ordered his assassination. Edgar Gutierrez, a political commentator, noted that these groups were motivated by a higer ambition. According zo Guiterrez, they wanted contorl of the state and the economy. Most of the information officers of the military dictatorship were infiltrated into orgaised crime, either part of the state, or close to it.

A report of the International commission against impunity in Guatemala, published in 2010, accuses the government of Óscar Berger (2004-2008?=), of having donee "social cleansing operations", and of having ordered extra-judicial killings.

Erwin Sperisen, director of national police, said that the use of legal and extra-legal force against "socially undesirable individuals" was a necessary means to be able to guarantee economic prosperity.

Principle of double effect

The principle of double effect or doctrine of double effect is an idea in philosophy. It says that it can be morally good to do something that has a bad effect so long as it also has a larger good effect. Here, "double effect" means "second effect" or "side effect." In plain English, the principle of double effect means, "It is acceptable for actions to have bad side effects so long as the good effect is much larger."

Historians think Thomas Aquinas was the first person to write about the principle of double effect but they are not sure. Thomas Aquinas lived in the 1200s. He wrote about killing in self-defense. Philosophers from before Thomas Aquinas, for example Augustine of Hippo, said it was never acceptable to kill another person, not even in self-defense. Thomas Aquinas said it was so long as the person did not kill their attacker on purpose and so long as the person does not fight harder than they need to. Here, the first effect is saving one's own life. The double effect (side effect) is killing the attacker. He wrote this in "Summa Theologica".

In the principle of double effect, it is okay to "foresee" a bad effect but not to "intend" it. This means a person who knows their action will cause something bad might still be acting within the principle of double effect, but a person who wants the bad effect definitely is not.

The "New Catholic Encyclopedia" says that for an action to follow the principle of double effect:


The principle of double effect is part of Roman Catholic philosophy. Medical doctors can also use it when deciding how to treat patients, especially patients who are in pain and want to die.

The principle of double effect is not the same as "the ends justify the means." In the principle of double effect, the goal is to make something good happen, and something bad happens too. The good and bad thing both come from the same action. In the ends justify the means, the person does something bad to make a good thing happen. The good thing comes from the bad action.

Some philosophers say that foreseeing a bad effect (knowing it will happen) and intending a bad effect (wanting and meaning it to happen) are not different enough for the principle of double effect to be real. Philosophers have used the trolley problem to study the principle of double effect.

Alaska Airlines Flight 261

Alaska Airlines Flight 261 was an international passenger flight from Puerto Vallarta to a stopover in San Francisco International Airport, to its destination in Seattle–Tacoma International Airport which suffered a serious mechanical failure on January 31, 2000, while flying over the Pacific Ocean, 4.3 km north of Anacapa Island in California. The two pilots, three flight attendants and the eighty-three passengers on board were killed.
Flight 261 left Puerto Vallarta at 14:30 PST. While en-route to San Francisco, the crew became aware of a horizontal stabilizer jam and kept Alaska Airlines maintenance informed of the issue while airborne at FL310. Captain Tansky tried a solution to unjam the stabilizer. The stabilizer unjammed and the aircraft assumed an extreme nose down attitude. Both pilots applied back pressure to their controls and recovered from the dive at FL260. The flight crew contact Los Angeles ARTCC to tell them that they are descending through FL260.

At 16:11, ARTCC asked Flight 261 about their condition, and the flight crew notified them that they were trying to troubleshoot a jammed horizontal stabilizer. The crew then requested, and were granted an altitude block between 20,000 and 25,000 feet. They were then handed off to Los Angeles Center 5 minutes later, who they notified of their intentions to divert to Los Angeles International Airport and their troubles in maintaining their altitude. Flight 261 was then cleared to FL170 and the crew then requested another block of altitude. This was the last transmission from the plane.

Captain Tansky then commented on the plane's tendency to want to pitch down. There were metallic thumping sounds and finally, the stabilizer gave way and the MD-83 pitched over violently, to which Captain Tansky replied, "this is a b*tch". The aircraft rapidly begins to descend, and the MD-83 was seen 'tumbling, spinning, nose down, continuous roll, corkscrewing and inverted'.

A pilot commented that "that plane has just started to do a big huge plunge". While inverted, the engines experience multiple compressor stalls and likely failed, causing the aircraft's rapid final descent. Just before 16:22 PST, Alaska Airlines Flight 261 crashed inverted into the Pacific Ocean. All 88 passengers and crew members were lost in the accident.

The aircraft, manufactured in 1992, had more than 26,000 flight hours at the time of the accident.

Among the 88 passengers were 12 employees of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, which led to a mourning on the part of the airline for those killed in this accident. Alaska Airlines stated that it was common for employees to occupy places that would otherwise go empty. Bouquets of flowers arrived at the airline's headquarters in Seattle - Tacoma, Washington the next day. Due to the extreme efforts of the pilots to regain control of the aircraft, their quick reaction to the emergency and the decision to avoid flying over populated areas, the international association of airline pilots awarded both the gold medal posthumously.

The following indicators were used to identify the bodies of the victims of Alaska Airlines Flight 261:

2-D is tall and skinny; his hands and feet are large and he has long limbs, with his height standing at 6'2". The character has pale skin and spiky azure blue hair. Thereafter, he is also depicted with a notable lack of visible pupils in his eyes due to the blood leakage from his hyphema; while his eyes can range from black to white, they predominately remained black throughout the first four phases. However, since "The Now Now", 2-D's eyes have been almost exclusively white. Additionally, he is also shown to be missing a few front teeth, and has sometimes been shown wearing a golden tooth. As with the rest of the Gorillaz characters, 2-D has thick, bushy, rectangular eyebrows. In "Gorillaz" artwork, 2-D's hair was darker and the spikes on his hair were thicker and sharper than they would become in much of the artwork for "Demon Days" and "Plastic Beach", where his hair became messier and brighter and the spikes became thinner and looser, to the point where he now appears to have a mildly receding hairline in some artwork for "Humanz" and "The Now Now". He also has blue bags under his eyes. He has a pointy chin and head shape that looks similar to that of fellow band member Noodle.

Anglophone Cameroonian

Anglophone Cameroonians (Camerounais anglophones in French) are Cameroonians who hails from the English-speaking regions of Cameroon (Northwest and Southwest regions). These regions were formerly known as the Southern Cameroons, which were part of the League of Nations mandate and United Nations Trust territory. An Anglophone Cameroonian is generally considered to be anyone who has lived in the Northwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon, has been given an Anglo-Saxon education and practices the Anglo-Saxon educational and legal system.

The two English-speaking regions of Cameroon represent for 17% of a population of 17 million (2005)

The Social Democratic Front, the largest opposition political party in Cameroon's parliament, is led by an Anglophone. Separatist movements, including the Southern Cameroons National Council (SCNC) and the Southern Cameroons Peoples Organization (SCAPO), call for the secession of the two English-speaking regions from French-speaking Cameroon in response to the dissolution in May 1972 of the federation formed in 1961 and the resulting marginalization of the English-speaking minority by the French-speaking majority and its political leaders. As of March 2017, only one of the 36 government ministers who control ministerial budgets is Anglophone.

In November 2016, after a law was not translated, Anglophone lawyers began a protest in Bamenda against the central government for failing to uphold the constitutional guarantee of a bilingual nation. They were joined by teachers, protesting central government appointees with lackluster English skills, and ordinary citizens. In December, security forces dispersed protests and at least two protesters were killed and others injured.

Protesters have also been accused of violence, however, the government's heavy-handed crackdown has revived calls for the restoration of Southern Cameroons' independence gained on the 1st of October 1961 Various protesters were arrested, including Nkongho Felix Agbor-Balla, the president of the Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium, and Fontem Neba, the group's secretary general. The Cameroon Anglophone Civil Society Consortium was declared illegal by the government on 17 January 2017 and "any other related groups with similar objectives" were prohibited."Amnesty International has called for the release of Agbor-Balla and Neba.

The central government shut down the internet in the Anglophone regions in mid January and was restored in April 2017, following a request for restoration by the United Nations.[4] The NGO Internet Without Borders estimated that the blackout cost the Cameroonian economy almost €3 million (US$3.2 million).



Anglophone Crisis

The Anglophone Crisis (), also known as the Ambazonia War, or the Cameroonian Civil War, is an ongoing armed conflict in the Northwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon. It is a part of the long-standing Anglophone problem. After the crackdown of the 2016–17 Cameroonian protests, Ambazonian separatists in the English-speaking Northwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon (formerly known as Southern Cameroons) started a guerilla warfare against Cameroonian armed forces. The later said that independence has occurred. In November 2017, the government of Cameroon declared war on the separatists. It sent its army into the regions.

The conflict started as a small insurgency. It spread to most parts of the area within a year. By the summer of 2019, the government controlled the major cities and parts of the countryside. The separatists controlled parts of the countryside. They were also seen often in the major cities. A year later, clearly-defined frontlines had formed. Cameroonian army would raid separatist-controlled towns and villages, but it would not try to recapture them. Its main concern was securing the major urban areas. The Cameroonian government is supported by Nigeria. Some separatist groups are supported by Biafran separatists.
Thousands of people have been killed in the war. More than half a million people have had to leave their homes. In 2019, talk took place bewteen Cameroon and the separatists for the first time. special status was given to the Anglophone regions. Despite this the war continued to intensify in late 2019. The 2020 Cameroonian parliamentary election cause more problems. The separatists became more assertive while Cameroon sent more forces. The COVID-19 pandemic saw one group declare a ceasefire to fight the spread of the virus. other groups and the Cameroonian government ignored this and kept fighting.
There has been very few tries at negotiating. Switzerland tried in 2019 but they failed. Separatist leaders who were returned to Cameroon from Nigeria in 2018 were sent to prison for life. There was growing international pressure for an end to the conflict. In July 2020 Cameroon began talking with these imprisoned leaders. The talks were held between Sisiku Julius Ayuk Tabe and other imprisoned leaders and representatives of the Cameroonian government. 

The situation is still taking place.

Elaeis

Elaeis (from Greek 'oil') is a genus of palms with two species, called oil palms. They are used in commercial agriculture in the production of palm oil. The African oil palm "Elaeis guineensis" (the species name "guineensis" refers to its country of origin) is the main source of palm oil. It is native to west and southwest Africa. It can be found between Angola and Gambia. The American oil palm "Elaeis oleifera" (from Latin oleifer 'oil-producing') is native to tropical Central and South America, and is used locally for oil production.

Mature palms are single-stemmed, and can grow well over tall. The leaves are pinnate, and reach between long. The flowers are produced in dense clusters; each individual flower is small, with three sepals and three petals.

The palm fruit is reddish, about the size of a large plum, and grows in large bunches. Each fruit is made up of an oily, fleshy outer layer (the pericarp), with a single seed (the palm kernel), also rich in oil.

The two species, "E. guineensis" and "E. oleifera" can produce fertile hybrids. The genome of "E. guineensis" has been sequenced, which has important implications for breeding improved strains of the crop plants.
These palms are grown commercially, mainly for three reasons:


In coastal West Africa, the use of these palms may date back about 5.000 years. Palm oil was discovered in a tomb at Abydos, dating back to 3.000 BCE.

Especially the African oil palm is widely cultivated in tropical countries outside Africa. Today, most of the commercially produced palm oil comes from Malaysia and Indonesia.

Palm oil is controversial. This controversy is not based on palm oil itself, but on the conditions how it is produced. Very often, rainforest, with a high biodiversity is destroyed to make room for palm oil plantations. The companies producing the palm oil also often force people to move away and change their way of life. Especially in Indonesia, there is growing pressure for palm oil producers to prove that they are not harming rare animals in the cultivation process.

In 2018 a Christmas TV advertisement by UK supermarket chain Iceland Foods Ltd, produced by Greenpeace, was banned by the UK advertising watchdog Clearcast, as it was deemed too political. Iceland Foods had committed to banning palm oil from its own-brand products by the end of 2018.

Sing 2

Sing 2 is a 2021 American computer-animated musical comedy film produced by Illumination and Universal Pictures. It is the sequel to "Sing" (2016). It was released on December 22, 2021. The film was directed and written by Garth Jennings.

Sometime after the events of the first film, Buster Moon is thriving with his new theater. Failing to impress talent scout Suki, who tells him he would not make it in Redshore City, Buster, encouraged by Nana Noodleman, reunites the singers who competed in the first film and takes them to the city. They sneak in for an audition with entertainment mogul Jimmy Crystal. However, uninterested in Buster's original show pitch, Gunter pitches a space-themed show which would feature Clay Calloway, a rock star who has not been seen in 15 years. Intrigued, Crystal greenlights it then tells them to have the show up and running within three weeks.

During production on the show, Rosita develops a fear of heights during rehearsal and is unable to keep on her role, which is given to Crystal's daughter Porsha while Rosita is delegated to a minor role. Meanwhile, Johnny has been assigned to work with top choreographer Klaus Kickenklober for his part in the show but feels that Klaus dislikes him. Johnny comes across a street dancer named Nooshy who agrees to help him out. Meena has been cast in a romantic scene with Darius, a self-absorbed actor with whom Meena has no chemistry. She later meets and falls in love with an ice cream vendor named Alfonso.

Ash and Buster visit Clay Calloway to convince him to be in the show. He refuses at first, but Ash changes his mind. Back at the theater, Buster asks Porsha if she would like to switch roles with Rosita, as she cannot act, which Porsha interprets as Buster firing her. Upon learning this, Crystal blames Porsha for embarrassing him and threatens Buster to drop him off his building and locks him in a closet. Suki frees Buster and warns him to get out of Redshore City before Crystal can kill him. Ash arrives with the crew and Calloway, who advises Buster not to run and hide like he did after he lost his wife. Buster then decides to have the cast and crew put on the show that night under Crystal's nose, and has Miss Crawly get Porsha to rejoin them in the show.

During the show, Klaus takes the place of Johnny's performance partner to try to undermine his number, but Johnny beats Klaus with encouragement from Nooshy and finally earns Klaus' respect while Meena visualizes Darius as Alfonso and performs a romantic duet with him. Crystal, having found out about the show, and angered when Porsha stands up to him, tries to stop it by dropping Buster off the top of the stage, which causes Rosita to get over her fear of heights to save Buster. When the time comes for Calloway to take the stage, he claims that he is not ready. Ash leads the crowd in a rendition of one of Calloway's songs, giving him the courage to perform a huge ovation.

After the show, Crystal is arrested by the police. While Buster and friends almost leave, Suki tells them that a major theater wants to put on their show. As the cast puts on their first performance, Buster watches from the VIP section, proud to have succeeded in Redshore City.

Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (movie)

Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a 2022 science fiction action-adventure movie based on the "Sonic the Hedgehog" video game franchise published by Sega. The movie is the sequel to "Sonic the Hedgehog" (2020), with Jeff Fowler directing from a script that was written by Patrick Casey, Josh Miller, and John Whittington and a story by Casey and Miller. The movie stars Ben Schwartz, Colleen O'Shaughnessey, Idris Elba, James Marsden, Tika Sumpter, Natasha Rothwell, Adam Pally, Shemar Moore, and Jim Carrey. "Sonic the Hedgehog 2" follows Sonic and Tails as they try to stop Doctor Eggman and Knuckles the Echidna from finding the Master Emerald. It was released in France on March 30, 2022 and on April 8, 2022 in the United States. A third movie and a spin-off series focusing on Knuckles are both in development.

Eight months after the events of the first movie, Sonic decides to help out his city as a vigilante hero with little success. Tom tells Sonic to remain patient for the day his powers will be needed before he and Maddie depart for Rachel's wedding in Hawaii. 

Sonic plans to have fun while home alone but is attacked by Robotnik, who has escaped the mushroom planet with the help of a powerful anthropomorphic echidna named Knuckles. To honor his ancestors, Knuckles demands the location of the legendary Master Emerald, an ancient relic that grants its user immense power and the ability to change reality to their will.

Sonic is rescued by Miles "Tails" Prower, an anthropomorphic two-tailed fox who idolizes him and comes to warn him about Knuckles. Sonic convinces Tails to help him find the Master Emerald, while Robotnik reunites with his assistant Stone and, scheming to steal the emerald, offers to help Knuckles. Sonic and Tails follow clues to a Siberian cave on a map Longclaw gave Sonic before sending him to Earth, where they find a compass within a temple. Robotnik and Knuckles track them and chase Sonic and Tails down a mountain. Knuckles reveals that he lost his father and his whole tribe the same day Sonic lost Longclaw. Despite this brief moment of sympathy, Knuckles and Robotnik steal the compass, though Knuckles begins to question Robotnik's sense of loyalty and honor when he mocks Sonic for choosing to save a wounded Tails instead of the compass.

Tom saves Sonic and Tails by using a ring to teleport them to the wedding. Rachel's fiancé Randall and his wedding guests reveal themselves as undercover agents of the Guardian Units of Nations (G.U.N. for short) and arrest Sonic, Tails, and Tom, who are then saved by Maddie and a vengeful Rachel, who reconciles with Randall. Meanwhile, Robotnik and Knuckles find an underwater temple containing the Master Emerald.

Blaming himself for Tails' injuries, Sonic decides to face Robotnik and Knuckles alone and goes to the temple, where he fights with Knuckles to keep him from taking the Master Emerald. Seeing this as an opportunity, Robotnik uses the distraction to seize and fuse himself with the emerald, which explodes and sinks the temple into the water. With no use left for Knuckles, Robotnik betrays him and leaves him along with Sonic behind for dead. Working together, Sonic and Knuckles are able to escape just as Tails rescues them in a biplane. In Green Hills, Robotnik uses his new abilities to create a giant robot resembling himself. Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles work together to fight the robot and its accompanying drones and to reclaim the Master Emerald; however, it breaks, splitting into the seven Chaos Emeralds. Tom and Maddie save Sonic, who uses the Chaos Emeralds to transform into Super Sonic. He destroys the robot before dispersing the Emeralds and reverting to normal. In the aftermath, Robotnik is presumed dead and Knuckles fixes the Master Emerald from the remaining shards, before making a pact to protect it from evil with Sonic and Tails, and they start an idyllic life with the Wachowskis.

In a mid-credits scene, G.U.N.'s forces have arrived at the site where the Giant Eggman Robot was destroyed. At the site, Walters is informed by his agent that they have been unable to find Robotnik. While Walters is sure that Robotnik could not have survived and bids him "good riddance", he does not notice Stone, who has disguised himself as a G.U.N. soldier, having survived himself to sneak away undetected. Walters is then informed by his agent that as they were removing Robotnik from their databases, they found a file dating back to over fifty years ago. This file contains coordinates to a well-hidden black site, and Walters realizes, much to his dread, that it concerns "Project Shadow". Meanwhile, in a remote research facility, a capsule slips out, inside of which a black hedgehog named Shadow awakens, his eyes crackling with chaos energy.


In February 2022, Sega of America and Paramount Pictures said they will be making a third Sonic movie, as well as a Knuckles spin-off series for Paramount+.

A dynamic systems model is based on development and done over a long period of time. The gender/sex theory states that the infant and their caregiver, through their way of life, will give the infant a sense of gender/sex in their world.

Cri du chat syndrome

Cri du chat syndrome (Cat's cry syndrome) is a medical condition that affects about 1 in 50,000 infants. 

Infants with this illness have a difference. When they cry it sounds like a cat meowing or sometimes like a cat screaming. As the child gets older, this doesn't happen so much. 

Cri du chat syndrome was first written about by Jerôme Lejeune, a French pediatrician in 1963, so it is sometimes called Lejeune syndrome. 

The syndrome is caused by a bad copying of a gene, which leaves part of chromosome 5p missing about 90% of its material. The condition affects more girls than boys: of six cases on average about one is a boy. What is the effect? The name gives a clue. Children who have it have problems with the voice box. They usually have other disabilities as well: some have a learning disability or physical disability, and others have both of these. 

The following symptoms are common:

Some of these problems mean that those who have this condition will almost certainly find life difficult. Only about half of children who have Cri du chat syndrome can eat with a spoon by the age of 3.5 years. 

This is a genetic disorder for which no treatment exists. Individual symptoms can be treated separately. The situation can be found before birth.

Nutri-Score

The Nutri-Score is a rating system that shows how healthy a piece of food is. In 2017, the French government selected it over several other, similar systems. The idea is to put the label on the front of products, so that consumers can easily compare. It is based on the calculation of a nutrient profiling system derived from the United Kingdom Food Standards Agency nutrient profiling system (FSA score). It has also been recommended by Belgian, Spanish, German and Dutch authorities as well as the European Commission and the World Health Organization. It was created by Santé Publique France, the French public health agency, based on the work of Serge Hercberg from Sorbonne Paris North University.

Nutri-Score was also chosen because it is the most efficient label that tells about the nutritional quality of foods.
A Nutri-Score for a particular food item is given in one of five classification letters: 'A' is the best, and 'E' the worst score. The calculation of the score involves seven different parameters of nutrient information per 100g of food which are usually available on food packagings.

High content of fruits and vegetables, fibers, protein and healthy oils (rapeseed, walnut and olive oils, rule added in 2019) promote a better score, while high content of energy, sugar, saturated fatty acids, and sodium promote a worse score. In addition to the general calculation rules applied to most types of food, there are special rules for cheese, for “added fats” (fats that are meant as ingredients, such as vegetable oils or butter), and for beverages.

EU laws do not allow countries to impose their own food labelling system, therefore they can only give recommendations.

The Nutri-Score has been officially recommended by health authorities in France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain and Switzerland.

In Portugal, Slovenia and Austria, some food companies such as Nestlé, Auchan or Danone announced that they would use the Nutri-Score although it was not officially recommended by the authorities.

Opposition to Nutri-Score is coming from a coalition of countries including Italy, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, and Romania. The Italian government has proposed a competing food label system. Southern EU countries say Nutri-score puts the traditional Mediterranean diet at a disadvantage.

The score is also used by Open Food Facts to allow people to compare the nutritional value of products.

Nutritional rating system

A nutritional rating system tries to communicate the nutritional value of food in a simple way: Foods are ranked, foods that have a higher "score", get a better ranking. In the end, the ranking is communicated with a label and a color. Some of these systems are targeted at a specific audience. Some systems use stars or points to rate the general nutritional value, other systems only look at certain attributes, for example cholesterol or sugar content.

How Do I Live

"How Do I Live" is an American country pop song. The musician and songwriter Diane Warren recorded this song. It was first performed under LeAnn Rimes when she was age 14 (almost 15). A more advanced version of "How Do I Live" by Trisha Yearwood, however, was the real Grammy and Golden Raspberry Award nominated song.

Both Yearwood and Rimes had their songs released on May 23, 1997. Warren first met Rimes inside a restaurant right after she (Rimes) won a Grammy Award for Best New Artist. Warren recorded the song when having Rimes in mind. When Rimes made her recording of the song the next day, however, Walt Disney Pictures (then called Buena vista Pictures Distribution), under which Touchstone Pictures was an operating label, decided she, then 14, was too young for singing of the song's subject matter. They also said then the recording by Rimes had too much "pop" sound. The violent plot of the movie "Con Air" (a 1997 action thriller) made the Touchstone Pictures skeptical to have the Rimes version in the movie. They then contacted older singer Yearwood. The latter recorded her cover of "How Do I Live". Her (Yearwood's) re-recording of the song was shown during "Con Air".

The version by Yearwood had a far more country vibe and style. The Yearwood and Rimes cuts had involvements in the United States' "Billboard" Hot 100. Rimes' version, though, was very strong on that chart. It was there for 69 weeks, the longest at that time. The Rimes cut was tagged onto compact disc and cassette. A longer version was later put on several studio albums, one being "You Light Up My Life: An Inspirational".

Rimes was more strong with the pop charts. Yearwood's version, however, was very strong in the country charts. The earlier's recording hit #2 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100 charts. The latter's version hit #23 on the same chart. For almost two months, Rimes' version of the song was #1 on the "Billboard" Adult Contemporary chart.

At the 1998 Grammy Awards, both songs were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Yearwood was given that award. She also won a 1997 Academy of Country Music Award for the Top Female Vocalist.

Bocourt's tree frog

Bocourt's tree frog ("Dryophytes bocourti") is a frog that lives in Guatemala. Scientists have seen it between 1300 and 1536 meters above sea level in Baja Verapaz and Alta Verapaz.
This frog lives in marshes and cloud forests. Scientists have found this frog in meadows full of water with no trees in them.

The adult male frog is 2.6 to 3.5 cm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 2.9 to 3.8 cm long. Female frogs have smooth skin on their backs, and male frogs are not smooth. This frog has disks for climbing on every toe on all four feet.

This frog is in danger of dying out because human beings change the places where it lives by cutting down trees, because humans let cows and other animals eat grass where the frog lives, because human beings build farms where the frog lives, and because of disease. Scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis can kill this frog.

Pork jowl

Pork jowl is a cut of pork from a pig's cheek. It is sometimes called jowl bacon or hog jowl in some parts of America. In the United States, it is often used in soul food. It is used worldwide, including the cured non-smoked Italian version called guanciale.

Jowl bacon can be fried and eaten as a main course, similar to streaky bacon. Often, jowls are as a seasoning for beans, black-eyed peas or cooked with leafy green vegetables such as collard greens or turnip greens. 

Jowl meat may also be chopped and used as a garnish, similar to bacon bits, or served in sandwich form. Pork jowl can be used in pork liver sausages such as liverwurst and braunschweiger, to help the meat stick together.

In the Southern United States, there is a tradition of eating black-eyed peas and greens with either pork jowls or fatback on New Year's Day. This is to ensure prosperity in the new year. The tradition goes back hundreds of years. During the American Civil War (1861 to 1865), the peas were thought to represent wealth, while the Northern army considered the food to be fit as livestock feed only. Some people saw pigs as symbols of "wealth and gluttony" and eating jowls or fatback on New Year's Day guaranteed a good new year.

Pork jowl can be cured. This made it a traditional wintertime food as it is able to be stored for long periods of time without refrigeration.

Contractualism

Contractualism is an idea in philosophy. It is part of moral philosophy, which is ideas about right and wrong.

There are two ways to think of contractualism: broad (general) and narrow (specific). Broadly, contractualism is the idea that morality comes from agreements between people. Keeping your promises is good and breaking them is bad. Narrowly, contractualism is a set of ideas from Harvard philosopher T.M. Scanlon. Scanlon wrote an essay, "What We Owe to Each Other."

Scanlon's essay says that the act of reasoning whether an action is good or bad (good thinking) is just as important as figuring out whether it is good or bad. That is, asking the right question in the right way is just as important as finding the answer. Scanlon's contractualism says that an action is morally bad if it "cannot" be explained as good to another human being.

Like many other philosophies, contractualism says that all human beings are equally important. It is different from other philosophies in "why" human beings are equally important. Contractualism says human beings are equally important because they can reason and think. For example, utilitarianism says human beings are equally important because they can all feel good or bad.

Scanlon's philosophies are in the television show "The Good Place". The show's writers say that Scanlon's philosophiles inspired parts of the show's main story. The characters read and talk about Scanlon's book on the show.

Uwu

codice_1, also used as codice_2, is an emoticon showing cuteness. The codice_3 letters represent eyes, while the codice_4 represents a mouth. 

codice_1 is used to show cuteness, , or kindness. Overuse of the emoticon can also have a effect of annoying its receiver. The emoticon has been popular in the furry fandom. 

There's a more surprised variant, codice_6 (also connected with the furry fandom and the response, "what's this?") that may mean cuteness, as well as curiosity and confusion.

codice_1 is known to exist back as far back as 2005, in an anime fan fiction. The origin of the word is not known, with many people believing it to originate in Internet chat rooms. By 2014, the emoticon had spread across the Internet into Tumblr, becoming an Internet subculture.

The word codice_1 is included in the Royal Spanish Academy's word observatory, defined as an "emoticon used to show happiness or tenderness".

In 2018, the official Twitter account tweeted "uwu" in response to a tweet by an artist on October 22, 2018.

In 2020, the U.S. Army Esports Twitter account tweeted "uwu" in reply to a tweet by Discord's Twitter account, which was met by lots of backlash from Twitter users. This event ended in a trend of attempting to get banned from the U.S. Army Esports Discord server as fast as possible, with a common technique being to link to the Wikipedia article, United States war crimes.

Thakur

Thakur is a historical feudal title of the Indian subcontinent. It is also used as a surname in the present day. The female variant of the title is Thakurani or Thakurain, and is also used to describe the wife of a Thakur.

There are varying opinions among scholars about its origin. Some scholars suggest that it is not mentioned in the Sanskrit texts preceding 500 BCE, but speculates that it might have been a part of the vocabulary of the dialects spoken in northern India before the Gupta Empire. It is viewed to have been derived from word "Thakkura" which, according to several scholars, was not an original word of the Sanskrit language but a borrowed word in the Indian lexis from the Tukhara regions of Inner Asia. Another view-point is that "Thakkura" is a loan word from the Prakrit language.

Scholars have suggested differing meanings for the word, i.e. "god", "lord", and "master of the estate". Academics have suggested that it was only a title, and in itself, did not grant any authority to its users "to wield some power in the state".

In India, the social groups which use this title includes the Brahmins, Ahirs, Jats, and Rajputs.

Sisir Kumar Das stated that the word "Thakur" is derived from the "late Sanskrit" word "Thakkura".

Harka Bahadur Gurung noted that the Nepalese version of the word "Thakur" is "Thakuri".

The meaning of the word "Thakur" was suggested to be "god" by S. K. Das; "lord" by Blair B. Kling; and "master of the estate" by H. B. Gurung.

Nirmal Chandra Sinha stated that the word "Thakura" is "unknown" to the Vedic and Classical Sanskrit and finds no mention in the Sanskrit literature preceding 500 BCE. He suggests, however, that "the word was possibly current in many north Indian dialects before the Imperial Guptas". Sinha notes that many scholars, such as Buddha Prakash, Frederick Thomas, Harold Bailey, Prabodh Bagchi, Suniti Chatterji, and Sylvain Lévi, have suggested that "Thakura" is a borrowed word in the Indian lexis from the Tukhara regions of Inner Asia. Sinha observed:
Byomkes Chakrabarti noted that the Sanskrit word "Thakkura" finds mention in "late Sanskrit". He doubted, however, that "Thakkura" is "an original Sanskrit word" and was of the opinion that "Thakkura" is probably a loan word from the Prakrit language.

Susan Snow Wadley noted that the title "Thakur" was used to refer to "a man of intermediate but mid-level caste, usually implying a landowning caste". Wadley further notes that "Thakur" was viewed as a "more modest" title in comparison to ""Rājā" (King)".

S. K. Das noted that while the word "thakur" means "god", it is also used to refer to the father-in-law of a woman. It is also used for a Brahmin, Ahir, Jat, and Rajput.

Some academics have suggested that ""Thakur" was merely a title and not an office whereby a holder was entitled to wield some power in the state". However, some other academics have noted that this title had been used by "petty chiefs" in the western areas of Himachal Pradesh.

The title was used by rulers of several princely states, including Ambliara, Vala, Morbi, Barsoda, and Rajkot State. Sons of thakurs were given the Sanskrit title of "Kumara" ('prince'), popular usage being "Kunwar" in the North and "Kumar" in Bengal and South India.

The territory of land under the control of a "Thakur" was called "thikana".

Ecnomiohyla

Ecnomiohyla, or fringe-limbed treefrogs or marvelous frogs, is a genus of frogs in the family Hylidae. A genus is a group of species. It is part of taxonomy, which is the way scientists put living things in groups.

Scientists invented this group in 2005 after looking very closely at which frogs they had put in Hylidae. At first, scientists had put ten species in this genus. Before that, those frogs had been in "Hyla". Two more species, "E. rabborum" and "E. sukia", were discovered later.

The name "Ecnomiohyla" comes from the Greek word "ecnomios" ("marvelous" or "unusual") and Hylas. In Greek mythology, Hylas was Hercules' friend.

Frogs in "Ecnomiohyla" are middle-sized or large. They have fringes of skin on their legs. They have very large front and back feet. They live in canopies in wet forested highlands in southern Mexico through Central America to Colombia. They are capable of gliding using their webbed hands and feet.

The genus has 12 species in it,
AmphibiaWeb lists the same species but also includes "Rheohyla miotympanum" in this genus.


Hyla palliata

Hyla palliata is a "nomina inquirenda". That means it is a name that scientists could give to a species, but it is not the name of any real species right now.

In the 1860s, Edward Drinker Cope and his team of scientists found a frog in Paraguay. They decided to name it "Hyla palliata". They killed one frog and brought it away with them as a sample, but then someone lost it. Later, other scientists disagreed about whether any species should be called "Hyla palliata". In 2006, Brusquetti and Lavilla wrote that the name "Hyla palliata" might be a good name for some of the frogs in "Boana".

Hypsiboas hypselops

Hypsiboas hypselops is a "nomina inquirenda". That means it is a name that scientists could give to a species, but it is not the name of any real species right now.

In the 1870s, Edward Drinker Cope and his team of scientists found a frog in South America. They decided to name it "Hypsiboas hypselops". But they did not write down exactly where they found it. Their notes said "Pebas, Equador." Today, scientists think Cope and his team found one of the frogs in "Boana" but they do not know which one.

Canyon tree frog

The canyon tree frog, Arizona tree frog, Sonoran tree toad, cañon tree toad, or Cope's hyla ("Dryophytes arenicolor") is a frog that lives in Mexico and the United States.

The adult frog is 3.2 to 5.7 cm long from nose to rear end. This frog eats many kinds of insects.

This frog is not endangered but there are fewer in the wild than there were. This is because human beings catch them. This frog is easy to catch while it is sitting in the sun on rocks. Human beings use this frog in scientific experiments. This frog is good for experiments about how animals stay warm.

Archaeplastida

The Archaeplastida (or kingdom Plantae "sensu lato" "in a broad sense") are a major group of eukaryotes. It include the photoautotrophic red algae (Rhodophyta), green algae, land plants and the minor group glaucophytes. It also includes the Rhodelphidia, an eukaryotrophic flagellate that is sister to the Rhodophyta, and probably picozoans. The Archaeplastida have chloroplasts that are surrounded by two membranes. All other groups which have chloroplasts, besides the amoeboid genus "Paulinella", have chloroplasts surrounded by three or four membranes.

The cells of the Archaeplastida do not have centrioles. They have mitochondria with flat cristae. They usually have a cell wall that contains cellulose. Food is stored as starch. However, these characteristics are also shared with other eukaryotes. The main evidence that the Archaeplastida form a monophyletic group comes from genetic studies. These studies show their plastids probably had a single origin. Not all scientists agree with these studies. Photosynthetic organisms with plastids of different origin (such as brown algae) do not belong to the Archaeplastida.

The archaeplastidans fall into two main evolutionary lines. The red algae are colored with chlorophyll "a" and phycobiliproteins, like most cyanobacteria, and accumulate starch outside the chloroplasts. The green algae and land plants are colored with chlorophylls "a" and "b", but do not have phycobiliproteins. Also, starch is built up inside the chloroplasts. These two groups are called Viridiplantae (Latin for "green plants") or Chloroplastida. The glaucophytes have cyanobacterial color. They are unusual as they havea cell wall within their plastids (called cyanelles).

Archaeplastida should not be confused with the older and obsolete name Archiplastideae. This term refers to cyanobacteria and other groups of bacteria.

Ambazonia

Ambazonia, officially the Federal Republic of Ambazonia is a secessionist state of Cameroon, self-proclamed in its English-speaking regions. De facto, Buea is the capital. It is bordered by Cameroon to the east, Nigeria to the west and Bioko island to the south east on the Gulf of Guinea.

Until 1961, Ambazonia was a British-controlled territory known as the Southern Cameroons, while the rest of Cameroon was French-controlled. At independence, a referendum was held and the voters of the Southern Cameroons chose to join Cameroon as a constituent state of a federal republic known as the Federal Republic of Cameroon. Over time, the power of the central government, dominated by French-speaking Cameroonians, has spread to the disadvantage of the region's autonomy. Many residents identify themselves as Anglophones and resent what they perceive as discrimination and the attempts of the Cameroonian government to eradicate Anglophone legal, administrative, educational and cultural institutions.

In 2016 and 2017, a demonstration was met with a violent government repression, which resulted in riots and violence against the security forces and, in 2017, a one-sided declaration of independence by the Ambazonian leadership. The violence escalated into guerrilla warfare and, since 2021, clashes have continued, with population centres and strategic locations largely controlled by the government engaged in counterinsurgency actions, while large parts of more isolated rural areas are controlled by the separatists and used to launch guerrilla attacks. Ambazonian forces have found it difficult to form a united front, and internal conflicts have obstructed efforts to negotiate with Cameroon or to establish control over the various militias involved in the war. Ongoing violence has led to widely reported human rights abuses by both sides, including indiscriminate killing of civilians, torture, rape and gender-based crimes, and unjustified detentions and kidnappings.

Ambazonia is divided in 13 counties who each have their own capital and 61 Local Government Areas (LGAs).

Existing houses were demolished for the North Circular Road. The route has other names at some points. However, it is mostly called the North Circular for route planning purposes. The route is mostly grade-separated dual carriageway from the A40 at Hanger Lane to the A13 in Beckton except for the Drury Way/Brentfield Road junction, the Golders Green Road/Brent Street junction, Henlys Corner and the section from Bounds Green to Green Lanes. In worse sections, the original names such as Gunnersbury Avenue and Bowes Road are used.

Police brutality

Police brutality is when police use too much force against people when they do not need to. It is not okay and it is against the law. Police brutality examples are Hurting people too much, using weapons when they do not need to, racism, and arresting people in painful ways.

Police brutality happens in many countries. This happens because the judiciary and the police fail. Sometimes the government wants the police to be very strict and punish people a lot, but this can result in police brutality. Sometimes the police do not learn how to do their job properly, and when they do something bad, they do not get in trouble. This can also make police brutality happen. Sometimes people are discriminated and this can make police brutality worse.

In countries with a lot of drug problems, like gang violence, drug selling, and overdosing because of drugs, the government often tries to stop the problem by working together. They try to change how people think about drugs through education, how the government works, and mostly by changing how the police do their job. Police get more money and power to fight drugs in neighborhoods. Some people think that the police should use any way necessary to stop drugs, and police might start getting trained and armed like the military. But, many studies show that these efforts do not work, and the drug problem gets worse. For example, in the United States, some people say that the government's plan to stop drugs, called the "War on Drugs", has not worked. They say that since the government started this plan, there have been more drug crimes and more people dying from taking drugs.

Sometimes the government does not make sure that police officers are held responsible for hurting or mistreating people. This can make it seem normal for police to be violent. It is common for people to use their phones to record police officers, but it is up to the legal system to make sure the police are doing their job correctly. One way to make sure police officers are doing their job correctly is by having them wear body cameras on their uniforms. However, sometimes the footage from these cameras is not shown to the public, making it hard to know if the police are doing their job correctly. In some places, the law does not have rules against police being violent. This means that police officers can use violence and not get in trouble if they say they had a good reason.

Police officers are allowed by the law to use force. People who work in law enforcement may become megalomaniacs if they have a lot of power. They begin to feel like they are in charge of society, especially when using old ways of policing. This can lead to the belief that they are not controlled by the law.

Some people think that certain officers are more likely to be violent because they have a certain mental condition called psychopathy. Studies have shown that there are different types of officers who are more likely to use too much force. These types include officers who have personality disorders, officers who have had bad experiences on the job, young or new officers, officers who were taught the wrong way to do their job, and officers who have personal problems. However, some people think that the idea that some officers are just "bad apples" is too simple. They say that there are bigger problems in the police system that can cause officers to be violent. These problems include the way that police officers are expected to act, the way that police officers are managed, and the way that police officers are held responsible for their actions. For example, some police departments have a culture of not telling superiours bad actions commited by other police officers.

In many laws, there are no rules to control how much force police officers can use. The use of force continuum is a guide that tells police officers what level of force is appropriate for different situations. But this guide is not used in many places. The government gives police officers the power to use force, but there are not many laws that limit how much force they can use.

Sometimes, even though it is legal, the police use too much violence. This is especially true when the police are trying to control or punish people for their political beliefs. Police brutality is a term used to describe when the police use violence for political reasons, when it is not acceptable according to society's values and beliefs. It means when the police use violence when it's not justified, which is different from using excessive violence but in justified circumstances.

Research shows that some police officers believe that the legal system is not working well, and they feel they need to take matters into their own hands. This is called "vigilantism", when police officers believe that a suspect deserves more punishment than what the courts will give them.

When the police chase a suspect at a high speed, the officers can become very angry and excited. This can make it hard for them to think clearly when they finally catch the suspect. This can lead to the officers using too much force. This is called "high-speed pursuit syndrome."


Battle of Batibo

The Battle of Batibo was fought during the Anglophone Crisis between Ambazonian separatists and the Cameroon Armed Forces. The battle was fought on March 3, 2018 when Ambazonian rebels attacked Cameroonian units on the Bamenda-Batibo Highway, Batibo Subdivision. At the time, it was reportedly the deadliest confrontation between Cameroonian and Ambazonian forces to date.

Although the circumstances of the battle remain unclear, reports claim that separatist forces ambushed Cameroonian soldiers who were celebrating the recent recapture of most villages in the Batibo subdivision. The number of casualties on both sides remains unclear, but reports on social media claim that 70 Cameroonian soldiers and "hundreds" of separatists died in the battle.

These casualty figures far outweigh the official figures at the time. Two months after the battle, Cameroon admitted to having lost at least 44 soldiers and policemen since the start of the armed conflict, of whom at least 22 had died between February and May.

The mayor of Batibo, Frederick Tanjoh, said that while the number of casualties was high - people on the ground claimed to have seen a military truck carrying a load of dead bodies - no information had been released by the authorities.

After the battle, mass arrests took place in the villages of the Batibo subdivision. The villages of Gurissen and Kwana in Haut Bafang, Tinto were burnt down by unknown persons, while the villages of Korgwe, Effa, Koroko, Ambo and Angie were completely abandoned. In total, over 4,000 people fled their homes after the battle, including the Fons who abandoned their palaces.

Indecent exposure

Indecent exposure is a term that is used that describes the act of a person deliberately showing parts of their body in a way that is not considered good behavior by local standards, called decency. 

These standards vary around the world. These rules are often affected by religion, morality, or tradition They can be justified as "necessary to maintain public order". Non-sexual exhibitionism, or public nudity, is sometimes said to be indecent exposure. If sexual acts are performed, or hinted at, it is very often considered to be indecent exposure. For this, there sometimes is a case of gross indecency. This term is usually used for a more serious offence. 

Many communities have ideas of what parts of the body should be overed in public. Not covering these parts may be seen as indecent exposure. For example. in many Muslim countries, a woman not wearing a veil may be seen as indecent. She may be seen as not being modest.

While a woman exposing her breast seen as indecent in many countries but they are often allowed to breastfeed their children in public without punishment. 

What defines indecent varies widely. For example, it is seen as indecent for a woman show their nipples in much of the United States. In these areas is women must cover their nipples with pasties. In other areas. women are allowed to be topless. New York City is a place were it is legal for a woman to be topless in public. The standard of decency are developed in each given community. They can also say what kind of clothing should be worn. There are societies, such as those in Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan, where the standards are very strict. In these societies, modesty requires that most of the body is covered, most of the time. In other societies, such as the tribal societies of the Pirahã or theMursi, is is normal for people to be naked.

The standards of decency have varied over time. During the Victorian era, exposure of a woman's legs and arms was seen as indecent in much of the Western world. At formal occasions, hair was sometimes required to be covered with a hat or bonnet. As late as the 1930s, and sometimes the 1950s. both women and men were expected to bathe or swim in public places wearing bathing suits that covered above the waist. An adult woman exposing her navel was seen as indecent in parts of the West into the 1960s and 1970s. Moral values changed drastically during the 1990s and 2000s. This also changed the criteria for indecent exposure.

Public exposure of the navel has been accepted in public. In the 2000s, the buttocks was often exposed while wearing a thong. For many years, however, it was quite common for women to show boobs at public beaches throughout Europe and South America and even some parts of the United States. From 2010 to 2020, the numbers of women going topless on beaches has taken a sharp drop. This is possibly explained by the rising popularity of the smartphone, combined with websites people share pictures of (partly) naked women.

Fair (event)

A fair is a gathering of people for entertainment or business related activities. A fair may last for one or several days or weeks and often happens every year at a specific place. 


The Roman fairs were holidays on which work and court cases stopped. In the Roman provinces of Judea and Syria Palaestina, Jewish rabbis stopped Jews from taking part in fairs in certain towns because the religious nature of the fairs contravened the prescribed practice of Judaism.

In the Middle Ages, many fairs developed as short-lasting markets and were very important for long-distance and international trade. Traders travelled, sometimes for many days, to fairs where they could be sure to meet those they needed to buy from or sell to. Fairs were usually tied to special Christian religious events, such as the Saint's day of the local church. Stagshaw, in England, held annual fairs as early as 1293 consisting of the sales of animals. Along with the main fair held on 4 July, the city also hosted smaller fairs throughout the year where certain types of animals were sold, such as one for horses, one for lambs, and one for ewes.

The Kumbh Mela, held every twelve years, at Allahabad, Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjain is one of the largest fairs in India, where more than 60 million people gathered in January 2001, making it the largest gathering anywhere in the world. "Kumbha" means a pitcher and "Mela" means "fair" in Sanskrit.

In the United States, fairs draw in as many as 150 million people each summer. Children's competitions at an American fair range from breeding small animals to robotics, whilst the organization 4-H has become a traditional association.

Choro-Q Advance

Choro-Q Advance (Japanese: チョロＱアドバンス "Choro-kyū Adobansu") (localized as Gadget Racers in the United States and Penny Racers in Europe) is the first of two "Choro-Q" video games to be released on the Nintendo Game Boy Advance.

"Choro-Q Advance" is described as a "CarPG". The main goal of the game is to advance across five sections of a world map, completing several events along the way in several categories (such as a simple race, a speed test, a single lap dash, a drag race or a braking test). Wins earn money and parts, with the player's stats being able to be upgraded through the use of new parts, and also visual customisation of the player's car, spedometer and changing their horn.

There were also other types of races - battle races where players would shoot eachother with weapons equipped to their cars, and races across water that would require floats. These two types would carry onto the sequel.

The game uses a graphical system similar to other GameBoy Advance racing games at the time, with Mode-7 styled ground effects with billboarded sprites intended to give the impression of 3D graphics.

This game allows players to share "bottle racers" with other players that would appear in the races of the players that received said bottle racers. This was included along with a traditional link-play mode via the Game Boy Advance Link Cable.



Plaisir d'amour

Plaisir d'amour is a well-known French love song. The text is from the novella Céléstine by Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian, published in 1784. Jean-Paul-Égide Martini composed the melody, and published it in 1785. In 1859, Hector Berlioz wrote a short piece for small orchestra, based on the melody.

Agatharchides

Agatharchides or Agatharchus was a Greek historian and geographer. He lived in the second century BC.

Agatharchides is believed to have been born at Cnidus. He was later a secretary to Heraclides Lembus.

Agatharchides wrote a few words about his own life. At the conclusion of his book "On the Erythraean Sea", he apologizes for being unable to complete his work "since our age is unable to similarly bear the toil" and "as a result of the disturbances in Egypt" he could no longer access the official records (a fragment cited by Photius in his "Bibliotheca" Cod. 250.110, 460b). 

Agatharchides was not well known in ancient times. Of his two major works, "Affairs in Asia" ("Ta kata ten Asian") in ten books, and "Affairs in Europe" ("Ta kata ten Europen") in forty-nine books, only a few fragments survive, too few to provide us with any sense of the contents of either work. However, for his "On the Erythraean Sea" ("Peri tes Erythras Thalasses" or "De Mari Erythraeo") in five books, almost the entire fifth book, a geographical treatise on the Horn of Africa and the lands around the Red Sea, has survived almost intact. According to Burstein, "the comparative soberness of Agatharchides' treatment compared to previous accounts and the wealth of information contained in it led to a quick recognition . . . [that it was] a valuable summary of the results of Ptolemaic exploration."

In the first book of "On the Erythraean Sea" was a discussion respecting the origin of the name. In the fifth Agatharchides described the mode of life amongst the Sabaeans in Arabia, and the Ichthyophagi, or fish-eaters, the way in which elephants were caught by the elephant-eaters, and the mode of working the gold mines in the mountains of Egypt, near the Red Sea. His account of the Ichthyophagi and of the mode of working the gold mines, has been copied by Diodorus (iii.12-18). Amongst other extraordinary animals he mentions the camelopard, which was found in the country of the Troglodytae, and the rhinoceros.

An Agatharchides, of Samos, is mentioned by Plutarch, as the author of a work on Persia, and one περὶ λίθων. J.A. Fabricius, however, the true reading is Agathyrsides, not Agatharchides. 

The crater Agatharchides on the Moon is named in his honour.

Three years before the Ball Drop got started was when Times Square began celebrating New Year's. The Times Square Ball lowering events take place one minute before midnight their time.

Between 1½ billion and 2 billion people celebrate while looking at the New York Times Square Ball Dropping.

Other places in the United States and Canada celebrate with other drops/object lowering and raising. These include the Miami Orange Drop, a similar New Year's Eve dropping in Orlando, a pineapple symbol lowered in Sarasota, a sardine symbol lowering for Eastport, Maine. They also drop a maple leaf symbol on the Atlantic Time celebrating when the New Year begins from there.

In the city of York, Pennsylvania, white roses are lowered almost each December 31. 

In Buffalo, New York another ball is dropped. The drop is, though, performed by manual operation.

In Fort Smith, Arkansas at Garrison Avenue and 6th Street, a Ball Drop celebration almost like New York is performed. In New Orleans, fleur de lys are brought down. The fleur de lys drops are shown on "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve" almost every New Years Eve Night. Tulsa, Oklahoma also performs a Central Time Area Ball Drop on New Years Eve.

In Seattle, Washington, when New Year's Eve celebrations are performed, the Space Needle's elevators are raised (sent up).

In December 2020 in most places, and for some the following year, New Year's raising and lowering parties were canceled or restricted for COVID-19 reasons and scheduling interference related to the COVID-19 situation.

Pomato

The pomato is a grafted plant. It is a combination of a tomato plant and a potato plant. The gardener grafts the two plants together: The gardener cuts and ties two separate plants so that they grow together.

Tomatoes and potatoes are both in the family "Solanaceae". In a pomato, cherry tomatoes grow on the vine or shoot part of the plant and white potatoes grow in the soil underground from the same plant.

This plant does not occur in nature and does not grow from seeds. The two parts of the pomato plant remain genetically separate, but, after they are grafted, they need each other to live and grow.

Pomato plants are one way to make food production more efficient. This way, more food can be made on the same amount of land. That makes the pomato good for city gardens, for example gardens on balconies. Grafted pomato plants began in the United Kingdom in September 2013.

Murder of Elli Perkins

Elli Perkins (née Present; 1949 – March 13, 2003) was a professional glass artist, and a Scientologist who lived in Western New York. She was a senior auditor at the Church of Scientology in Buffalo, New York.

When he was in his mid-20s, her son, Jeremy showed strange behaviour; he was diagnoesed to suffer from Schizophrenia. The group Scientology is against psychiatry, most of the time. To be in line with what Scientology said, Elli Perkins did not look for psychiatric care, or treat his illness with antipsychotic drugs. Instead, she tried to treat this with vitamins.

His condition did not get better. At some point, Jeremy thought, Elli was posioning him. He later explained: "she makes me take these vitamins everyday". In this context, the "vitamins" were the alternative medicine he was forced to take. When he was about 28 years old, Jeremy, tried to kill himself, but failed. Because he felt threatened, he murdered his mother.

The crime was prominently featured in the news. Newspapers such as "The Amherst Bee", "The Buffalo News", or the "New York Post reported on it." There was also an installment of the investigative news program 48 Hours. The media asserted that his mother was at least partly responsible for her own death: Her refusal for his treatment by a psychiatrist, caused his outburst, and her death.

A court later said, that because he was suffering from Schizophrenia, and that he wasn't treated correctly, Jeremy could not be made responsible for killing his mother.
