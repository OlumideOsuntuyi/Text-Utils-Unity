Dialogue system

A dialog system or conversational agent (CA) is a computer system intended to converse with a human, in coherent, structured language. Various so-called "dialog systems" have employed text, speech, graphics, haptics, gestures and other modes of communication on both the input and output channel.

What does and does not constitute a dialog system may be debatable. The typical GUI wizard does engage in some sort of dialog, but it includes very few of the common dialog system components, and dialog state is trivial.

Alexa, Bixby, Cortana, Siri, and digital PAs generally, are meant to be CAs, as are conversational AI bots like the GPT-3 Lena. But modern systems have a latency time of 4 years. An up-to-date CA would be able to read this text.

Windows Server 2012

Windows Server 2012, codenamed "Windows Server 8", is the sixth release of Windows Server. It is the server version of Windows 8 and succeeds Windows Server 2008 R2. Two pre-release versions, a developer preview and a beta version, were released during development. The software was generally available to customers starting on September 4, 2012.It's mainstream support ended on October 9, 2018 and extended support ended on October 10, 2023. Windows Server 2012 is eligible for the paid Extended Security Updates (ESU) program (free for Azure Virtual Desktop users). It allows to purchase Security Updates for 3 years, in early installments. Security Updates are available for the operating system until October 13, 2026.

Unlike its predecessor, Windows Server 2012 has no support for Itanium-based computers, and has four editions. Various features were added or improved over Windows Server 2008 R2 (with many placing an emphasis on cloud computing), such as an updated version of Hyper-V, an IP address management role, a new version of Windows Task Manager, and ReFS, a new file system. Windows Server 2012 received generally good reviews in spite of having included the same controversial Metro-based user interface seen in Windows 8.

The successor to Windows Server 2012, called Windows Server 2012 R2, was released along with Windows 8.1 in October 2013. A service pack, formally designated Windows Server 2012 R2 Update, was released in April 2014.

Windows Server 2012, codenamed "Windows Server 8", is the sixth release of Windows Server family of operating systems developed concurrently with Windows 8. It was not until April 17, 2012 that the company announced that the final product name would be "Windows Server 2012".

Microsoft introduced Windows Server 2012 and its developer preview in the BUILD 2011 conference on September 9, 2011. However, unlike Windows 8, the developer preview of Windows Server 2012 was only made available to MSDN subscribers. It included a graphical user interface (GUI) based on Metro design language and a new Server Manager, a graphical application used for server management. On February 16, 2012, Microsoft released an update for developer preview build that extended its expiry date from April 8, 2012 to January 15, 2013.

Before Windows Server 2012 was finalized, two test builds were made public. A public beta version of Windows Server 2012 was released along with the Windows 8 Consumer Preview on February 29, 2012. The release candidate of Windows Server 2012 was released on May 31, 2012, along with the Windows 8 Release Preview.

The product was released to manufacturing on August 1, 2012 and became generally available on September 4, 2012. However, not all editions of Windows Server 2012 were released at the same time. Windows Server 2012 Essentials was released to manufacturing on October 9, 2012 and was made generally available on November 1, 2012. As of September 23, 2012, all students subscribed to DreamSpark program can download Windows Server 2012 Standard or Datacenter free of charge.



Windows Server 2016

Windows Server 2016 is a server operating system developed by Microsoft as part of the Windows NT family of operating systems, developed concurrently with Windows 10. The first early preview version (Technical Preview) became available on October 1, 2014 together with the first technical preview of System Center. Windows Server 2016 was released on September 26, 2016 at Microsoft's Ignite conference and became generally available on October 12, 2016. It has two successors: Windows Server 2019, and the Windows Server Semi-Annual Channel, which excludes the graphical user interface and many older components.

Microsoft has been reorganized by Satya Nadella, putting the Server and System Center teams together. Previously, the Server team was more closely aligned with the Windows client team. The Azure team is also working closely with the Server team.

In March 2017, Microsoft demonstrated an internal version of Server 2016 running on the ARMv8-A architecture. It was reported that Microsoft was working with Qualcomm Centriq and Cavium ThunderX2 chips. According to James Vincent of "The Verge", this decision endangers Intel's dominance of the server CPU market. However, later inquiry from Microsoft revealed that this version of Windows Server is only for internal use and only impacts subscribers of Microsoft Azure service.

A public beta version of Windows Server 2016 (then still called "vNext") branded as "Windows Server Technical Preview" was released on October 1, 2014; the technical preview builds are aimed toward enterprise users. The first Technical Preview was first set to expire on April 15, 2015 but Microsoft later released a tool to extend the expiry date, to last until the second tech preview of the OS in May 2015. The second beta version, "Technical Preview 2", was released on May 4, 2015. Third preview version, "Technical Preview 3" was released on August 19, 2015. "Technical Preview 4" was released on November 19, 2015. "Technical Preview 5" was released on April 27, 2016.

Windows Server 2016 Insider Preview Build 16237 was released to Windows Insiders on July 13, 2017.

Windows Server 2016 was officially released at Microsoft's Ignite Conference on September 26, 2016. Unlike its predecessor, Windows Server 2016 is licensed by the number of CPU cores rather than number of CPU sockets—a change that has similarly been adopted by BizTalk Server 2013 and SQL Server 2014. The new licensing structure that has been adopted by Windows Server 2016 has also moved away from the Windows Server 2012/2012R2 CPU socket licensing model in that now the amount of cores covered under one license is limited. Windows Server 2016 Standard and Datacenter core licensing now covers a minimum of 8 core licenses for each physical processor and a minimum of 16 core licenses for each server. Core licenses are sold in packs of two with Standard Edition providing the familiar rights to run 2 virtualized OS environments. If the server goes over 16 core licenses for a 2 processor server additional licenses will now be required with Windows Server 2016.

Windows Server, version 1709 was released on October 17, 2017. The release has dropped the Windows Server 2016 name and is just called Windows Server by Microsoft.

Manuela Saenz's nickname was Manuelita. She married a wealthy English doctor James Thorne, who was twice her age, in 1817. 

She was an active member in the conspiracy against the viceroy of Perú, José de la Serna e Hinojosa during 1820. She left her husband in 1822. She had an affair with Simón Bolívar until he died in 1830. She often wore a colonel's uniform, with her two black servants Jonatás and Nathán, also in soldier's uniforms

Saenz was called “la libertadora del libertador” because she saved Simon Bolivar's life. She followed Bolivar on his campaigns and saved his life in 1828. When assassins came for him she let him escape out the window. Manuela is quoted to have said "Go ahead, cowards, Kill me! Kill a woman!” when she was making time so Simon could escape.

Saenz attempted to kill herself with a snake after Bolivar died, Saenz thought that no matter if Simon Bolivar died, his influence would never die because he gave so many people freedom. After Simon died she became a shopkeeper, Simon Bolivar had many lovers but it was only Saenz who he took with him into the most dangerous marches of the wars of independence in Latin America.

Manuela went through inequality in her childhood and she wanted independence and a change. She was fighting battles in the 1820’s. She wore men’s clothes and a mustache from a dead Spanish soldier. She smoked. Manuela Saenz acted like a nurse on the battlefield at Ayacucho, Ecuador. When the rebels won she earned a rank of lieutenant.

She also acted as a nurse and a combatant spy expert, army general, mistress. After Simon Bolivar died his enemies sent Manuela out of Colombia to Peru. She continued her political activity in Peru. People believed that women should not be involved in politics so it was easier for them to be smugglers and spies. When she was trying to get people's attention she sent letters to people of power. She was exiled from Ecuador in 1835 because she was accused of trying to overthrow the government. In her letters she shows that women wanted to become involved with politics.

She is known as a war hero because she helped a lot of countries be independent from the Spanish rule. Manuela Saenz died in Paita, Peru in 1856. Her body was put into a communal grave, She died of a diphtheria epidemic. Saenz's remains have been carried through Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. She was given a full state burial in Venezuela in 2010. There have been ceremonies to honor her and her help to many countries.

Dungeons and Dragons Satanic Panic

In the 1980s, the fantasy roleplaying game "Dungeons & Dragons" was attacked and accused of supporting Satanism, and leading people to commit suicide. 

Some religious beliefs and fear of the unknown led to false accusations against things that were different from the norm. The protest against it changed the game forever and made players have to adapt to new rules. Many wanted to stop D&D completely, but in the end  compromises were made and the game is enjoyed by millions today.

In the 1980s, fear of the occult was a big problem. It all began when a mother believed her daughter's daycare center was teaching her to support and worship Satan. Daycare centers were very new back then and parents were afraid of the safety of their children. This one mother's accusation led an investigation as other parents started making false claims. 

The interrogated children never said anything bad happened. Parents got so mad at this that many police scared the kids into saying what they wanted to hear. Accusations like this spread across the country, from rock music to card games. D&D was a big part of those accusations.

D&D was arguably the first true role-playing game. Many people feared the occult and because of all these reports with D&D, suicides and murders, people also started fearing D&D. Time magazine published an article about D&D being satanic. 

Though it was satire, it still caught on to people's fear of the occult. This fear led to problems with the criminal justice system. For example the West Memphis 3, 3 teens accused of murder, were prosecuted just because of people being scared of the occult. Even a policeman changed a story about the Irving Pulling case (Suicides & Harm) because he was scared of TSR suing him.

James Dallas Egbert III disappeared in 1979 from his dorm in Michigan State University. He was found alive in the utility tunnels of the school two days later by a private investigator after James attempted suicide. His mother had found his suicide note the day before. The note referenced Egbert’s character in D&D needing to die because a demon told him to kill himself. 

His mother completely blamed the game. Egbert suffered from many mental illnesses that were not researched enough, including depression, schizophrenia, and anxiety. William Dear, the private investigator, suspected that the game had caused James' actions. 

The media took this as a fact and started an outrage against D&D. Dear thought Egbert went into the tunnels to play a live action version of the game. A year later, Egbert died from a gunshot suicide This story was the basis of the book (and later movie) Mazes & Monsters.

In 1983 the suicide of Irving Lee Pulling II was also associated with D&D. Patricia Pulling, Irving’s mom, founded Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons as a result. Ms.Pulling found other D&D players who did harmful actions such as James Curbing, a rabid player, who killed his school principal, wounded three classmates, then shot himself. There was a view that teenagers could not see the difference between fantasy and reality, and that all these murders and suicides were building on that, especially after many suicide notes mentioned the game.

August, 1983. Investigators found Irving Lee Pulling and his brother dead from gunshot wounds beneath a railroad trestle. Irving had a gun in hand. Police thought it was a murder suicide. Pulling saw the incident as more than a murder suicide. She blamed Irving’s favorite game, Dungeons and Dragons, for his death. 

Classmates say the trestle they were found under was a frequent place the boys would venture to play D&D. Investigators found that earlier that day Irving’s character had a curse cast upon him. The curse was supposed to cause his character “emotional pain and damage.” Pulling the curse was real, and was the cause of his suicide.

Patricia Pulling said her claims about D&D supporting Satan had to be true because no one would be able to write with so much detail (in the manuals) without vast knowledge of the occult. Some monsters from the original Advanced Dungeons & Dragons were demons, with varying degrees of power over the characters. Patricia sued Irving’s school for allowing the kids to play there. The principal argued that the game was not part of the curriculum of the school, and the charges were dropped. 

The CDC found no link between the game and violence. Yet, Patricia continued her fight by creating the group BADD. BADD’s messages and PSA’s spread across the world. Patricia released a book titled The Devil’s Web- Who is Stalking Your Child for Satan?  In it she said players will become a “homosexual satanists who will sacrifice their parents, their sister, and the family cat, then commit suicide in a satanic ritual". (From Patricia's Book)

Some people still thought D&D was good. Michael Stackpole published articles like The Pulling Report and The Truth About Role-Playing Games to discredit Pulling's claims about D&D. Stackpole found that the suicide rate for people who DID play rpgs was actually lower than the suicide rate for the general population.

Eventually, due to the negativity, TSR made changes to the game. James Ward, an executive at TSR had demons and devils removed from the Monster Manual and Assassins and some spells removed from the Player's Handbook. Ward explained his actions in an article in Dragon, a magazine about fantasy role-playing games, saying that "Avoiding the Angry Mother Syndrome has become a good, basic guideline, for all of the designers and editors at TSR, Inc.". In later editions TSR re-added some of the removed features in a separate manual intended for mature readers. (From 5e monster manual)

Today, the game is played around the world, and parents can be rest assured knowing that their children are not becoming Satanists.

Poor People's Campaign

Greensboro sit-ins

The Greensboro sit-ins were a series of peaceful protests that happened in Greensboro, North Carolina. They happened from February 1 to July 25, 1960. Many of them happened at the F. W. Woolworth Company store in the town. At Woolworth’s you could only sit on the stools if you were white. 

There were four men influenced by non-violent protest. The four men were young black students at the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. This started because these four men wanted to prove a point about segregation. The four men were inspired by Mahatma Gandhi. They were inspired by the Freedom Riders. They planned their protest very carefully. They sat at the table. They wanted to be served, but did not get served. They just sat and did not leave. On the second day there were 20 people. The sit-ins made local news. 
The students wrote the following letter to the president of Woolworth's:Dear Mr. President: We the undersigned are students at the Negro college in the city of Greensboro. Time and time again we have gone into Woolworth stores in Greensboro. We have bought thousands of items at the hundreds of counters in your stores. Our money was accepted without rancor or discrimination, and with politeness towards us, when at a long counter just three feet away our money is not acceptable because of the colour of our skins...We are asking your company to take a firm stand to eliminate discrimination. We firmly believe that God will give you courage and guidance in solving the problem. 

Sincerely Yours, Student Executive CommitteeThe sit-in movement then spread to other Southern cities, including Winston-Salem, Durham, Raleigh, Charlotte, Richmond, Virginia, and Lexington, Kentucky.

By February 8, 500 people joined the protest. .

Because of the protest the F. W. Woolworth Company department store chain stopped its policy of racial segregation.

Budget padding controversy

Budget padding controversy was a controversy that affected the House of Representatives of Nigeria. It led to the suspension of Abdulmumin Jibril, the chairman of the House Committee on Appropriation. He was suspended for 180 legislative days and removed as Chair, House Committee on Appropriation in June 2016 over an allegation he leveled against the speaker of the house, Yakubu Dogara and three other principal members of the house of representatives, Yusuf Sulaimon Lasun, Alhassan Doguwa and Leo Okuweh Ogor.

On 20 July 2016, Jibril accused the speaker of the house and the principal officers of fraud, corruption, and padding of the 2016 budget and this led to his suspension on 28 September 2016. He was suspended for 180 legislative days.

According to "Premium Times Nigeria", Jibril said "My resolve to champion this cause was borne out of patriotism and desire to complement the present administration’s anti-corruption war from the legislative front,”

He claimed that the principal officers including the speaker of the House allotted to themselves a sum of N40 billion out of the 100 billion naira apportioned to the House of Representatives. He indicted the speaker and accused him of aiming to smuggle the sum of 30 billion naira into the 2016 budget. The speaker rebutted the allegation and subsequently described it as blackmail.

In a counter claim, the lawmakers through the Chairman, Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Abdulrazak Namdas stated that his suspension was connected to his investigation by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission and abuse of power during his tenure as Chairman of Finance Committee.

On 13 March 2018, his suspension was rescinded by the lawmakers after he submitted an apology letter to the House.

Whistling

Whistling by people can be done without a whistle. Hard to describe, it is done by creating a small opening with one's lips and then blowing or sucking air through the hole. The air is moderated by the lips, curled tongue, teeth or fingers (placed over the mouth).

The use of pursed lips, tongue and sometimes fingers is to create turbulence The curled tongue acts as a resonant chamber, acting as a type of Helmholtz resonator. The art of whistling is a hard task to accomplish but is much easier once mastered.

Whistling is done to make people at a distance hear your signal. Sometimes used to call a cab, it can be used in dense forest or on hill-tops. It is a non-verbal method of communication which says, in effect, "take notice, I'm here". Whistling is widely used by shepherds to control their dogs.

Helmholtz resonance

Helmholtz resonance or wind throb is air resonance in a cavity. Examples:

The name comes from a device created in the 1850s by Hermann von Helmholtz, the "Helmholtz resonator". He used it to find the various frequencies or musical pitches in music and other complex sounds.

Hermann von Helmholtz

Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz (31 August 1821 – 8 September 1894) was a German physician and physicist who made significant contributions in several scientific fields. The Helmholtz Association is named after him.

In physiology and psychology, he is known for his mathematics of the eye, theories of vision, ideas on the visual perception of space, and color vision research. His work on the sensation of tone, perception of sound, and the physiology of perception is also notable.

In physics, he is known for his theories on the conservation of energy, work in electrodynamics, chemical thermodynamics, and on a mechanical foundation of thermodynamics.

As a philosopher, he is known for his philosophy of science, ideas on the relation between the laws of perception and the laws of nature, the science of aesthetics, and ideas on the civilizing power of science.

Silicon controlled rectifier

Silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) is a type of thyristor. It is a four-layer solid-state current-controlling device.

SCRs are unidirectional devices: they conduct current only in one direction. Normally, SCRs can be triggered only by currents going into the gate.

A rectifier is an electrical device that converts alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). SCRs are used for rectification of high-power AC in high-voltage direct-current power transmission. They are also used in the control of welding machines.

SCRs are mainly used in devices for the control of high power, perhaps with high voltage. They are suitable for use in medium- to high-voltage AC power control applications, such as lamp dimming, power regulators and motor control.

Calendar era

A calendar era is the year numbering system used by a calendar. The Gregorian calendar for example numbers its years in the Western Anno Domini system (the Coptic Orthodox and Ethiopian Orthodox churches have their own Christian eras). The instant, date, or year from which time is marked is called the "epoch" of the era. There are many different calendar eras such as Saka Era.

In ancient times, regnal years were counted from the year a new monarch took the throne. This makes ancient timelines very difficult to reconstruct, because they are based on separate and scattered king lists, such as the Sumerian King List and the Babylonian Canon of Kings. In East Asia, having era names based on ruling monarchs ended in the 20th century except for Japan, where they are still used.

Alcione

Alcione is an extinct genus of nyctosaurid pterosaur from Maastrichtian-aged rocks from the Ouled Abdoun Basin in Morocco. It was one of six new Maastriichtian-aged pterosaurs described in 2018. Two of these pterosaurs are yet to be named.

Barbaridactylus

Barbaridactylus is an extinct genus of nyctosaurid pterosaur from Maastrichtian/Danian-aged rocks from the Ouled Abdoun Basin in Morocco. It was one of six new Maastriichtian/Danian-aged pterosaurs described in 2018. Two of these pterosaurs are yet to be named.

"Barbaridactylus" was probably a slender pterosaur. Its arm and wing bones were averagely sized for a pterosaur of its time.

"Barbaridactylus" was described based from two specimens.

The first specimen consisted of a partial jaw, a single neck vertebra, part of the arm and wing bones and the left thigh bone.

The second specimen (catalogued as USM93000) consists of a well preserved skeleton.

"Barbaridactylus" was discovered in the Ouled Abdoun Basin in Morocco. It coexisted with the pterosaurs "Alcione", "Simurghia", "Tethydraco" and "Phospatodraco" and the dinosaur "Chenanisaurus".

It may be a member of the Protorosauria; an unusual combination of traits similar (such as the long neck) and dissimilar (such as the absence of a hook on the fifth metatarsal bone) to other members causes "Pectodens" to elude exact classification.

Vlamertinge

Vlamertinge is a village in the Belgian province of West Flanders and a borough of the city of Ypres. The village center of Vlamertinge lies just outside the city center of Ypres, along the main road N38 to the nearby town of Poperinge.

In addition to the city center of Ypres itself, Vlamertinge is the largest borough of Ypres. In the west of Vlamertinge, along the road to Poperinge, is the hamlet of Brandhoek.

The earliest data about Vlamertinge date from the Middle Ages. In 857 a chapel was built in Vlamertinge. In 970 Ypres was destroyed and the chapel of Vlamertinge burned down. The oldest document, known to date, which includes the name Flambertenges, is a deed of the year 1066. Baldwin V, Count of Flanders, his wife Adela and their son Baldwin, in this deed gave goods to the church and the Chapter (religion) from Sint-Pieters by Lille. These goods were, among others, a tenth located in Elverdinge and also a tenth located in Vlamertinge - "In territorio Furnensi, in villa Elverzenges, decinam unam ; Flambertenges decinam similiter unam".

In the Ancien Régime Vlamertinge was a "Heerlijkheid" of Veurne-Ambacht with 22 backlendings and suffered a lot from the sieges of nearby Ypres.

During the First World War, the whole village was destroyed by bombing. In 1944, during the Second World War, Vlamertinge was liberated by a Polish armored division.

Vlamertinge would come from Flambert (a name) + inga (son, descendant of (genitive)) + heim (domicile). The oldest known spellings of the current Vlamertinge are: Flembertenges (1066), Flamertingha (1123), Flambertinghes (1142), Flamertinge (1154), Flamertinga (1185), Flamertinghe (1200), Flambertengues (1202), Flamertinghes (1238), Flamertinges (1269), Vlamertinghe (1272), Vlamertinghes (1275), Flamertenghe (1275), Vlamertincghe (1280), etc.

Vlamertinge is 17 meters above sea level. The municipality also borders Ypres in the East, Voormezele in the Southeast, Kemmel and Dikkebus in the South, Reningelst in the Southwest, Poperinge in the West, Elverdinge in the North and Brielen in the Northeast.

From 1487 to 1697 we see a large decline in the population of Vlamertinge. The most plausible explanation for this would have been the Eighty Years' War in the Seventeen Provinces.

There are 70 to 80 stores in Vlamertinge. In Vlamertinge there is a large company Valcke that makes concrete constructions and therefore also offers employment for many people in the village.


Vlamertinge had its own municipal council and mayor until the mergers of 1977. Mayors were:

Its fossils were found in the same Pompeiian aged rocks as which "Scipionyx" was discovered in, which were about 110 million years old.

Pliny the Elder (d. 79 AD near Pompeii) called fossils of these animals "ammonis cornua" ("horns of Ammon") because the Egyptian god Ammon (Amun) was typically depicted wearing ram's horns. Often the name of an ammonite genus ends in -"ceras", which is Greek (κέρας) for "horn".

Aviva plc is a British multinational insurance company headquartered in London, United Kingdom. It has about 33 million customers In the United Kingdom, Aviva is the largest general insurer and a leading life and pensions provider.

Aviva also has a focus on the markets in Europe and in Asia and, in particular, on the growth markets of China and South East Asia. Aviva is also the second largest general insurer in Canada. Aviva has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange, and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

CGU plc was a large insurance group, created by the merger of Commercial Union and General Accident in 1998. The Company was listed on the London Stock Exchange. It merged with Norwich Union in 2000 to form CGNU plc, later renamed Aviva plc.

Commercial Union was established following a conflagration near London Bridge in 1861, known as the Great Tooley Street Fire, which destroyed a number of warehouses and wharves along the River Thames as a result of which the fire insurance companies were hit by a series of massive claims. Consequently, they increased their fire insurance rates so dramatically that a group of local merchants and brokers decided to form their own company. This became known as the "Commercial Union Assurance Company Ltd."

It purchased the Hand in Hand Fire & Life Insurance Society, the world's oldest fire insurance company, in 1905 and The Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation Ltd. in 1910 and it continued to grow by further acquisitions.

General Accident was a financial services firm formed by several mergers and acquisitions over several years. The General Accident and Employers' Liability Assurance Association Ltd. was founded in Perth, Scotland in 1885. It became the General Accident Assurance Corporation Ltd. in 1891.

General Accident acquired Yorkshire Insurance Company Ltd. in 1967. All general insurance business was relocated to Perth, with York becoming the centre for the new firm's life assurance and pensions business.

General Accident acquired Stevenage-based Provident Mutual Life Assurance Association in 1995, merging it with the GA Life and Pensions business as Provident Mutual Life Assurance Ltd. York became the centre of all life assurance business and Stevenage of all pensions business.

Norwich Union was the name of insurance company Aviva's British arm before June 2009. It was originally established in 1797. In 1997, it was demutualised and listed on the London Stock Exchange, and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

On 29 April 2008, Aviva announced that the Norwich Union brand would be phased out and disappear over a period of two years, on the grounds that a consistent Aviva brand would bring "global impact".

Paul Klee

Paul Klee (18 December 1879 – 29 June 1940) was a Swiss-German artist. He was one of the most famous painters of the 20th century. His work was influenced by Expressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism. He was also very interested in the theory of color.

Klee was born in Münchenbuchsee, a town near Bern in Switzerland. His mother, born Ida Maria Frick, came from Basel in Switzerland. His father, Hans Klee, came from Tann, a small town in the Hesse state of Germany. Both his parents were musicians. When he was very young he trained to be a violinist. Then he decided to become an artist. He studied art under Heinrich Knirr. In 1899 he was admitted to the Academy of Fine arts in Munich. After leaving the academy he also studied art in Italy. After Italy, he returned to Bern and lived with his parents for several years.

Klee married the pianist Lily Stumpf in 1906. They went to live in Munich. In 1906 he had his first major exhibition. Besides his painting, Klee taught art at the Bauhaus from 1920 to 1931. and later at the Dusseldorf Academy. When the Nazis came to power in Germany, life became very hard for modern artists. Klee moved back to Switzerland in 1933. He died in Muralto, Switzerland in 1940. For many years he had suffered from scleroderma, an autoimmune disease.

Klee made over 10,000 paintings, drawings, and etchings in his lifetime. His works are held in museums all over the world. In 2005, the Zentrum Paul Klee (Paul Klee Center) was opened in Bern. The building was designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano. It holds 4000 works by Klee and shows 150 at time. The exhibition changes every six months.

These pictures are from Klee's mature career. He painted them while he was teaching at the Bauhaus. During this time he was also a member of a group of artists called Die Blaue Vier (The Blue Four). The other three members were Wassily Kandinsky, Lyonel Feininger, and Alexej von Jawlensky. Like Klee, both Kandinsky and Feininger taught at the Bauhaus. The four artists lectured and exhibited together in Germany and the USA. 

Indohyus

Indohyus (meaning "India's pig") is a small deer-like creature, which lived about 49 or 48 million years ago in Kashmir, India. It belongs to the artiodactyls family "Raoellidae", and is believed to be the closest sister group of Cetacea. It lived during the same time as the related "Pakicetus". The two may have coexisted.

About the size of a raccoon or domestic cat, this herbivorous creature shared some of the traits of whales. It also showed signs of adaptations to aquatic life, including a thick and heavy outer bone coating. This is similar to the bones of modern creatures such as the hippopotamus, and reduces buoyancy so that they can stay underwater. This suggests a similar survival strategy to the African mousedeer or water chevrotain which, when threatened by a bird of prey, dives into water and hides beneath the surface for up to four minutes.

There are two known species of Indohyus:

Himalayacetus

Himalayacetus is an extinct aquatic cetacean known from fossils found in the Himachal Pradesh, India. It lived in the remnants of the ancient Tethys Ocean during the early Eocene. This extends the fossil record of whales by some 3.5 million years.

"Himalayacetus" lived in the coastline of the ancient Tethys Ocean before the Indian plate collided with Eurasia. It is only known from a single jaw fossil, which makes exact comparisons with other cetaceans almost impossible.

Inferno (Dante)

Inferno by the Italian author Dante, is a work of fiction made in the 1500s, as a part of The Divine Comedy. It tells of the fictional journey that two men, Dante himself as well as Greek poet Virgil, takes place through Christian Hell. Hell is made up of several levels, or circles, in which sinners are divided and punished according to their sins. Their punishments are measured according to how many good deeds vs bad deeds were done.

The Divine Comedy describes the journey of the soul toward God. And Inferno is about the recognition and rejection of sin. 

Qubit

A Qubit (or QBit) is a unit of measure used in quantum computing. 

Like a bit in normal (non-quantum) computing, a Qubit has two distinct states, 0 state and the 1 state. However, unlike the normal bit, a qubit can have a state that is somewhere in-between, called a "superposition."

You cannot measure the superposition without the superposition going away (changing). If you try to measure a qubit that is in a superposition, the qubit will change, and become one of two states. The resulting state the qubit changes to depends on how it is measured. For simplicity, let's assume we are measuring in a way that will make the qubit change to either a 0 state or a 1 state.

A qubit can be represented as a 2-element column vector.

A qubit in the 0 state looks like formula_1. 

A qubit in the 1 state looks like formula_2.

In general, a qubit state will look like formula_3 , where formula_4.

α and β are called amplitudes. They can be complex numbers. Each state has an amplitude.

By squaring a state's amplitude, you can get the probability of measuring that state.

Each state can also have a phase. The phase is part of the amplitude and is what can make the amplitude a complex number.

A state's phase is like how much that state has rotated. The angle of phase is usually represented as either Φ or φ. Let's use φ.

φ can go from 0 to formula_5 radians. The angle sort of goes into an Euler identity, where instead of formula_6, the formula_7 gets substituted with the angle φ. The state's phase becomes formula_8.

This expression formula_8is a phase factor that becomes part of a state's amplitude. It gets multiplied with the amplitude.

A phase angle of 0 makes the amplitudes positive real numbers, since formula_10.

A phase angle of formula_11 makes the amplitudes negative real numbers, since formula_12. (This is Euler's identity)

A phase angle of formula_13 makes the amplitudes positive imaginary numbers, since formula_14.

A phase angle of formula_15 makes the amplitudes negative imaginary numbers, since formula_16.

Beyond 0 and formula_5, the phase angle just wraps back around again, since it is just a rotation.

An example qubit may look like formula_18. There is a 50% chance of measuring a 0 or a 1. There is a phase of 1 on the 0 state's amplitude. There is a phase of -1 on the 1 state's amplitude.

Qubits are generally written as kets, which look like formula_19. Kets are part of Bra-Ket notation, also known as Dirac notation. Kets are a way of saying column vector.

The 0 and 1 state are written as formula_20 and formula_21 respectively. 

A general qubit in ket notation will be written as formula_22.

This equation is exactly the same as formula_23, since formula_24

Austin serial bombings

The Austin serial bombings were a series of five parcel bomb explosions which occurred from March 2 - 20, 2018 in Austin, Texas, United States. They killed two civilians and the bomber, as well as injuring another six people.

The suspected bomber was Mark Anthony Conditt, age 23, who lived in Pflugerville, Texas, outside Austin.

The Austin Police Department (APD) believe the explosions were connected and considered the possibility that they are racially motivated. They have also warned civilians to not open suspicious packages, and to call the police.

Austin police officially connected the March 2 bombing following the bombings on March 12. None of the packages were mailed, instead they were placed near the individuals' homes. Two of the bombs were triggered upon being picked up, another was triggered upon being opened, and the fourth bombing was suspected to be activated by tripwire.

On March 2, 2018, 39-year-old Anthony Stephan House was killed by picking up an apparent package bomb at his home. Then, on March 13, 2018, the bombings killed 17-year-old cellist Draylen Mason. 

Authorities first offered a reward of $65,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction of the bomber or bombers. They later raised the reward to $115,000.

On March 20, 2018, President Donald Trump said at the White House: "This is obviously a very, very sick individual, or maybe individuals...These are sick people, and we have to find them as soon as possible". 

Early on March 21, Mark Anthony Conditt was identified by investigators via security footage taken at a FedEx store, and police moved in to make an arrest. As SWAT officers approached, he detonated a bomb in the vehicle, killing himself and injuring one of them, prompting other officers to fire upon the vehicle.

Alexej von Jawlensky

Alexej von Jawlensky (13 March, 1864 – 15 March 1941) was a Russian painter. He first studied art in Russia but he spent most of his career in Germany. He painted in the Expressionist style and was particularly known for his portraits. He also painted landscapes and still lifes.

Jawlensky was born in Torzhok, a town in the western part of Russia. His father, Georgi von Jawlensky, was a colonel in the Imperial Russian Army. Like his four brothers, Jawlenskywas became an officer in the army. He studied at the military academy in Moscow, but was very interested in art. He studied art privately while he was serving as a soldier. In 1890 he was accepted at the St. Petersburg Academy of Art. He received permission from the army to study art there while still serving as a soldier. He became friends with artists who worked in the studio of Ilya Repin.

In 1896, Jawlensky resigned from the army. He went to Munich in Germany to study art and begin his career as a painter. In Munich he lived with Marianne von Werefkin. She was a painter who studied with Repin. He studied with Anton Ažbe in Munich. He also became friends with Wassily Kandinsky. Kandinsky became an important influence on Jawlensky's art. In 1902 Jawlensky's son Andreas was born. His mother was Hélène Nesnakomoff (1881-1965). She was Marianne von Werefkin's maid in Russia and then lived with her and Jawlensky in Munich. In 1905–1906 Jawlensky travelled to Paris for an exhibition of his paintings. In Paris he met Henri Matisse. Matisse became another important influence on Jawlensky's painting style. World War I began in 1914. Jawlensky was expelled from Germany because Russia was one of the countries fighting against Germany. He went to live in Switzerland.

In 1922 Jawlensky married Hélène Nesnakomoff. They returned to Germany and settled in Wiesbaden. For the next 11 years, he concentrated on abstract paintings of heads. He also organized the artistic group "Die Blaue Vier" (The Blue Four). The other three members of the group were Kandinsky, Lyonel Feininger, and Paul Klee. The four artists lectured and exhibited together in Germany and the USA. From 1929 Jawlensky suffered very badly from arthritis. He had to give up painting in 1937 because he could no longer hold his brushes. He died in Weisbaden in 1941 at the age of 77.

Jawlensky's son Andreas (1902-1984) also became a painter. As a teenager he exhibited with his father. By the end of the 1920s, he became known in his own right. Andreas served in the German army during World War II. He was captured by the Russians and spent 10 years in prisoner of war camp in Siberia. His later paintings, done in Germany and Switzerland, were mostly landscapes. In 1987 there was an exhibition of both Alezej and Andreas's paintings in New York City.

The first picture is a portrait of Jawlensky's future wife, Hélène Nesnakomoff from 1900. It was painted in the more realistic style taught in the art schools of Russia. The later paintings show the influence of expressionism and fauvism on Jawlensky's work after he moved to Germany.

Sustainability in Conwy

The local authority of Conwy is located in North Wales and borders Gwynedd and Denbighshire. The County includes some of North Wales’s largest settlements such as Llandudno, Colwyn Bay and Conwy town. It has holds 4% of Wales’s total population at 111,273 for mid-2006 according to the national assembly for Wales (2006). Industry in this county has changed considerably over the last 2 centuries as during the industrial revolution slate quarrying was a big industry as stated by Day (2002, PP36) “The most distinctive economic feature of north-west Wales was its unique slate quarrying industry”. However, in recent times there has been a big emphasis on tourism, especially in seaside resorts such as Llandudno. But one big questioned raised by many in recent years is how is sustainability being implemented in Conwy? This article will focus on sustainable approaches in which Conwy as a local authority are implementing over the next couple of years. This report assesses the sustainability of Conwy in regards to environmental, social, cultural and economic considerations in this region but also looking at Conwy’s LDP and corporate plan for 2017-2022.

Conwy being located on the North Wales Coast and stretching into the Snowdonia National Park has very impressive and outstanding scenery. Although as mentioned earlier slate quarrying in some of these areas has left scaring on the landscape with “entire mountains chiseled away” Day (2002, PP36) in some areas. It is therefore crucial that Conwy is enlisting schemes to help preserve its environment for future generations. In 2016 the Welsh assembly government published the Environment for Wales act (2016). This act applies to all the public bodies in wales and aims to help Welsh local authorities by up to 80% by 2050 - Conwy Council (2017) and this features in both the corporate plan and the LDP for Conwy.  
They plan to do this by a number of objectives including implementing sustainable coastal and flooding defenses so properties and the coastline at risk are protected by a scheme, which is fit for purpose. Also the CBCC (2017) is aiming to improve recycling facilities and working with the Welsh government to increase recycling and reduce their Carbon footprint by investing in more renewable energies. In regards to renewable energy in this county they are trying to promote the development of a tidal lagoon in Colwyn Bay. This project would not only produce renewable low carbon energy for North Wales but can act as a coastal defense on the Conwy coastline and has potential to be used as a recreational facility. The County are also looking into other renewable energy schemes for the future decades. Leading on from this the CBCC (2017) state in there LDP that they are focusing on improving the landscape of areas that have been scared because of quarrying as mentioned earlier. This is in conjunction with the environment for Wales act (2016) and mentions that they are introducing agricultural grading to their land to ensure it returns its essential nutrients and increasing peat productions. Another scheme which is CBCC are looking to implement is a green wedge scheme. This involves promoting and encouraging the amount of green space available in the county and this is incorporated in both their LDP and corporate plan. 

Cultural sustainability is the adapting beneficial parts of a specific nation’s history and culture to help the development for the future and present generations. Aspects such as language and historical buildings reflect tradition values of past cultures and can therefore be used as a means to measure sustainability. In the 2011 census published by the Conwy County Borough Council, that in Conwy: 
Studies in China show that among those living in China there was strong evidence of residents having a specific connection to building that represent their history and past culture. Even though this is a study that was conducted in China, examples of this can also be seen everywhere in the world including Conwy. This sense of longing for historical styled building is evident in Wales in terms of listed buildings. 

In Wales (and England) buildings with significant historical interest are often classified into either Grade I or Grade II buildings. Grade I listed buildings are buildings with significant historic relevance whereas Grade II listed buildings are buildings which are important in reflection to past history and culture but with less significance than Grade I buildings. Accorded to the British Listed Building website Conwy has a total of 254 listed buildings (both Grade I and Grade II), which is the second highest in the whole of Wales, second to Llandudno which has 394 and then followed by Abergele which has 81. The listed buildings in Conwy range from Grade I listed buildings such as: 
Grade II buildings such as:
Buildings can also be used to view the national identity of the area through the eyes of those living there and those visiting as in recent years culture has played an important part of tourism and is increasingly in demand from tourists which is reflected in the Conwy Culture Centre. The development of this cultural centre was funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2015 and a planning application was approved in 2017 which allows building and development to start. The Centre was planned to provide a safe space for youths to meet as well as a place to hold and display historic collections as well as offer training programmes and volunteer opportunities to locals who live in the area to improve their quality of live and the job aspects etc they are able to get. These aspects are all insightful of the ‘Conwy County Borough Council annual report 2016/17’ which explains how they had created a new strategy to increase the number of Welsh speakers (as well as the quality of the language that people who can speak the language were confident that they were able to speak). It also said that they had gained enough funding to be able to begin to develop the centre. As well as this it stated that heritage tourism within Conwy was increasing as a result of the changes that they made and that the volunteering support that was bring provided by the Conwy Culture Centre was worthwhile as two of the volunteers who took part were awarded with well-known awards (BBC Sports Wales young volunteer of the year).

One of the four main indicators which are usually used to measure successful sustainability is the social aspects available in an area. Often studies into social sustainability include “housing, household structure, paid domestic work, material cultures of home and homelessness”. In attempt to reduce the rate of homelessness in Conwy, Conwy County Borough Council have made a five year strategy in 2013 (Local Housing Strategy). The aims of this strategy included making housing more affordable in attempt to allow the working population, those most likely to be renting homes, to remain in the area as housing is hard to afford. 2,200 homes in Conwy in 2015 were overcrowded as families could not afford large enough houses. Conwy County Borough Council (2015) also reveal that homelessness began to decrease in 2005, however overall, the rate of homeless in Conwy is lower than the national average for Wales. The Conwy Housing Solutions has an online help guide for those who are affected by homelessness and those that are expected to become homeless within 8 weeks and explains how Part 2 of the 2014 Housing (Wales) Act and Conwy County Borough Council (CCBC) can offer help. As well as homelessness in general studies have shown that there is often more homeless females than males and that this pattern is not being investigated enough and also that often, as women have different needs to men, women who are homeless suffer more from the effects of homelessness than men do.
Unemployment levels in Conwy in 2005 were 4% which was higher than the average for Wales at the time. One possible explanation for this could be due to the fact that in many places women still struggle to get jobs in 'male-dominated' fields such as farming and building therefore they often aren't able to get training or if they already have the necessary training they can find anyone to hire them. To try to change the problem with gender inequality in Conwy, CCBC have formed a ‘Strategic Equality Plan’ which was put into action in 2016. This plan attempts to contest gender inequalities in employment, pay and training by 2020.

Economic sustainability in Conwy is being planned by Conwy County Borough Council through the Conwy economic growth strategy 2017-2027. The creation of renewable energy has a great potential to increase the sustainable development of specific areas by creating a large selection of socioeconomic benefits such as improving regional and rural development opportunities, employment opportunities and the establishment of a domestic industry (del Río and Burguillo, 2009). There are five ambitions in Conwy’s economic growth strategy 2017-2027, one of them being to facilitate the tidal lagoon as mentioned earlier and other renewable energy projects across the county Conwy Council 2018. The tidal lagoon will create employment opportunities for the people of Conwy improving the sustainability of the local economy. Sourcing from small businesses can also improve the economic sustainability of local economies. Buying from small businesses can add to the development of the local economy in a variety of ways such as providing innovative green products and services (Walker and Preuss, 2008).
Conwy council want the local economy to be confident, resilient and sustainable. Conwy council will encourage new ideas and will work proactively with businesses to promote conditions in which they can grow. This is evidence that Conwy Council are aiming to effectively improve their local economy through the enhancement of local businesses that will in turn increase the economic sustainability of Conwy. Sustainable tourism is important for sustainable economic development. Appropriate policies are being applied within the Principality of Wales through the Wales Tourist Board to ensure successful sustainable tourism development (Owen, Witt and Gammon, 1993). An ambition of the Conwy Economic Growth Strategy 2017-2027 is to create winter tourism offer across the county making Conwy a year-round visitor destination Conwy Council (2018). This is an appropriate policy for Conwy as the area faces problems associated with seasonal tourism. The improvement of winter tourism in Conwy aims to counteract these problems and make the county a year-round tourist destination. Tourism is an important part of Conwy’s local economy and the creation of sustainable year-round tourism will further support the local economy, specifically in winter months. This will then improve the sustainable economic development of the County of Conwy. Higher education provides benefits to individuals and the society and must be considered when evaluating the economic sustainability of an area. Students who attend higher education obtain a wide range of personal and financial benefits (Baum et al, 2010). This would then support individuals in contributing to their local economy and its sustainable development. The Conwy County Borough council have recognised this and aim to establish a dedicated higher education presence in the county as outlined in the Conwy Economic Growth Strategy 2017-2027. This ambition will lay out a future for higher education institutions in the area and Wales as a whole. The increase in students attending higher education institutions shall then see a rise in financial benefits in Conwy County which will in turn promote the development of a sustainable economy in the area.

In Summary Conwy has introduced a variety of schemes to help preserve the county for future generations. It is good to see that sustainability features so much in both the council’s Local development plan and corporate plan 2017-2022. It would be interesting to revisit this in the next five year and to see what goals featured in the corporate plan have been met and in particular developments on the proposed Tidal Lagoon in Colwyn Bay.

Anton Ažbe

Anton Ažbe (30 May 1862 – 5/6 August 1905) was a Slovene painter and teacher of painting. He painted in the realist style. Less than 30 of his paintings and drawings survive. The National Gallery of Slovenia in Ljubljana holds most of his works. He was most famous for his private painting school which he opened in Munich in 1892. Many foreign students came to study with him including Alexej von Jawlensky and Wassily Kandinsky.

Anton Ažbe and his twin brother Alois were born to a peasant family in Dolenčice, a small village in Slovenia. Their father died of tuberculosis when the boys were seven years old. Their mother had a very bad mental illness. She could not look after the farm or take care of the boys. A guardian took care of them. Anton had very poor health. He did not grow like a healthy child. He remained very short all his life. He also had problems with his spine and his legs. His guardian sent him to Klagenfurt as an apprentice to a merchant. After five years Ažbe ran away. He went to Ljubljana. In Ljubljana he met the painter Janez Wolf. He helped Wolf paint frescos in churches.

In 1880 Wolf helped Ažbe get into the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. Ažbe studied for there for two years, but he did not like the academy's teaching method. He thought it was old-fashioned. In 1884 he moved to the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. The Munich academy was much more modern. Ažbe did very well there. His teachers, Gabriel von Hackl and Ludwig von Löfftz, admired his work. The academy gave him a scholarship. He and his friend Ferdo Vesel, another art student, earned extra money by selling their drawings and paintings. They also earned money by helping other students with their painting and drawing assignments.

Ažbe finished his studies at the Munich academy in 1891. By that time he was already known for his portrait painting. His paintings were shown in art exhibitions at the Glaspalast. The Glaspalast was a large glass and iron exhibition building in the old botanical garden of Munich. It was modeled after the Crystal Palace in London. In 1892, Ferdo Vesel encouraged Ažbe to give private lessons to art students in Munich. He started with seven students who rented a room for their lessons, but the number grew very fast. Soon Ažbe was able to rent a building on 16 Georgenstrasse for the school. He also had his own studio on that street. The door to the school had a sign that said "Nur fest!" ("Be bold!"). The school became very famous. It specialised in painting nudes and portraits. Famous artists who studied at Ažbe's school included Alexej von Jawlensky and Wassily Kandinsky.

Ažbe did all the teaching at the school by himself. This left little time for his own painting. In his later years Kandinsky wrote about his old teacher's generosity and kindness. Ažbe often gave free lessons to students who could not afford to pay. Ažbe died from cancer in 1905 at the age of 43. His obituary in a Munich newspaper described him as a man of great modesty and one of the city's "most original and best-known artistic personalities."

The game is centered around being the last person alive. It also consists of a storm slowly moving towards a point on the map, dealing 1-10 damage per second, depending on how long the game had lasted. If a player is caught in the storm for too long, their character is eliminated. The game is so popular that one weekend 3.6 million people were playing it. According to  Dexerto, Fortnite saw an average of 236 million monthly players in the past 30 days(as of March 2023), with a peak daily player reaching 15 million. In the first year of Fortnite, Epic Games made a mode called Save the World which is Fortnite's main campaign. Fortnite is one of the most popular games in the world, where around 40 million people log on to play the game monthly. The original version of this game was called "Save The World" and was first introduced in 2011 with the name of Fortnite. In this mode, your mission is to save the survivors trapped in the storm zone. Fortnite has had 29 seasons, with the latest coming out in the morning of March 8, 2024.

The game starts with up to 100 players. The player may join with other players to form a team of two to four players, or the player may play on their own. The main goal of the game is to be the last player or team alive by eliminating or avoiding other players. The round starts with weaponless players skydiving from floating buses (called "Battle Buses") into a region of land. The game is set in that particular environment with all of the weapons, health items and other combat support that is needed for players to survive. Opponents attack other players and defend themselves by building structures. Throughout the game, a purple storm approaching from outside the land will move closer and closer towards the center of the map. Any player caught in the storm will become damaged. This directs surviving players closer to each other, forcing them to have to fight against each other. During the match, supply drops that provide legendary weapons and items will appear in random locations. Similar to "", "Fortnite Battle Royale" is primarily played in third-person perspective (a type of perspective where the player controls the character as if they were around the character).

What makes "Fortnite Battle Royale" unique from other battle royale games is the new building system, originating from the original Fortnite game. Players may destroy objects in their environment to provide materials so that they can build fortifications (walls, roofs, floors, etc) that help protect them from enemies. Some fortifications can be built quickly, but they will be destroyed easily. Some fortifications, however, can be built slowly but resists attacks better. In Chapter 3 Season 2, a no-build mode was introduced that removes the building mechanic.

The game is free-to-play, however players have the option to make in-app purchases that earn extra V-Bucks. "Vinderbucks", or V-Bucks for short, allows players to purchase new skins for their characters, weapons, or dances. The player can also earn V-Bucks without in-app purchases through completing missions or challenges that can even include skins.

Ever since Fortnite Battle Royale was first released, Epic Games, the creator of the game, has added new features to it regularly. They frequently add new items and weapons for the game as well as fixing up any glitches or other critical problems in the game that affect gameplay via updates.

Fortnite Battle Royale has "seasons" that last for about 10 weeks each. These seasons introduce a new theme, along with a new chapter in the game's storyline. Each season also brings new content, including new exclusive skins and new gameplay elements. There are currently 29 seasons, broken up into (mainly 4, excluding the new chapter 5 Season 1 update) 5 chapters.

On October 15, 2019, a new chapter was released to Fortnite Battle Royale. This added even more new gameplay like boats, fishing, new guns, a lot of guns and items being vaulted, and a completely new map.

The game quickly gained popularity, with over 10 million players playing the game within the first two weeks of release. As of March of 2019, Fortnite Battle Royale has 250 million players, exceeding the population of Canada.

"Fortnite Battle Royale" has also been popular with children, even though the game is all about shooting each other. The game's cartoonish art style, free-to-play nature (does not cost money to play the game), and being able to interact online makes it attractive to kids. Since the release of the mobile version of "Fortnite Battle Royale", many parents and teachers were concerned about how it affects children psychologically. Teachers have noticed that children are easily distracted when playing Fortnite. Epic Games, the creator of "Fortnite Battle Royale", responded by adding warning labels to the game's loading screens that the game should not be played during a class session.

Some agencies (organizations that service a special field) were worried that many children are not getting enough proper exercise and real-world social interaction because of playing games such as "Fortnite". Other agencies had warned parents that "Fortnite Battle Royale" causes children to do violent behavior. On April 2019, Prince Harry proposed that "Fortnite Battle Royale" should be banned. He believes "Fortnite Battle Royale" has a negative effect on society. He said, "The game should not be allowed, Its created to addict children. An addiction to keep you in front of a screen for as long as possible. It's so irresponsible."

This dynasty ruled India for a huge period from the 7th century to the 11th century. They had Ujjain as the capital and later shifted to Kannauj.

Vatsaraja (775–805) was the next powerful ruler of the dynasty.
Kannauj kingdom was ruled by a weak ruler, after the death of Harshavardhana. The Pratiharas, The Palas and The Rashtrakutas fought to get control over Kannauj. But Vatsaraja of Pratihara defeated the Palas and the Rashtrakutas. Around 786, Rashtrakuta ruler Dhruva (780–793) crossed the Narmada River into Malwa. From there he tried to capture Kannauj and defeated Vatsaraja.

Byzantine Greeks

The Byzantine Greeks (or Byzantines) were the Greek people of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. They lived in the lands of the Byzantine Empire, then called the Eastern Roman Empire, like Greece, Asia Minor and Cyprus. They spoke medieval Greek, preserved Greek culture, obeyed Roman law and followed Eastern Christianity. Their society had peasants, traders, teachers, soldiers and priests.

The Byzantines called themselves Romans ("Romaioi"), Greeks ("Graikoi", "Hellenes") and Christians ("Christianoi") throughout their history. They used those names synonymously because they were the political heirs of the Roman Empire, the offspring of the ancient Greeks, and believers in Jesus Christ. The Byzantines also called everything that was not Greek "barbarian" and called paganism "Hellenism".

Byzantine Greek society had different classes like the poor, the peasants, the soldiers, the teachers, the merchants, and the priests.

There were two groups of poor people in the Greek world since the time of Homer: the "ptochos" (, "passive poor") and the "penes" (, "active poor"). Byzantine Greek peasants lived in villages; drank wine; and ate grains, beans, fish, bread and olives. They were hunters, fishers, bee-keepers, craftsmen, smiths, tailors and shoemakers.

Soldiers were chosen for military duty every year and served as medics and technicians. Their appearance, customs, habits and life were part of Greek and Roman military tradition. Along with farmers, they ate a type of dried biscuit or hard bread, called a "paximadion" (originally called a "boukelaton").

Byzantine education was part of an ancient Greek educational tradition that started in the 5th century BC. It was made up of three levels: elementary school with students aged six to ten years old, secondary school with students aged ten to sixteen years old and higher education.

Literacy was much higher in the Byzantine Empire than in Western Europe. Elementary school education was widely available in places like towns and the countryside. Secondary schools were mostly in larger cities, and higher education was offered at the University of Constantinople.

In elementary schools, teachers used simple fairy-tale books like "Aesop's Fables". In secondary schools, teachers used ancient Greek texts like the "Iliad" and the "Odyssey" of Homer.

The life of a Byzantine Greek woman was split into three stages: girlhood, motherhood and widowhood. Daily life for women included doing household and farm chores. Poor women sometimes wore sleeveless tunics, and most wore a veil, called the "maphorion", which covered their hair. Wealthy women bought and wore silk fabrics and clothes with expensive jewelry. Some women worked as traders, clerics and teachers.

Byzantine Greek traders were mobile and developed new methods of investing money like the "chreokoinonia". Byzantine Greek priests were close to the rest of society and were allowed to get married except for bishops.

Sea ice

Sea ice is simply frozen ocean water. It forms, grows, and melts in the ocean. In contrast, icebergs, glaciers, ice sheets, and ice shelves all originate on land. Sea ice occurs in both the Arctic and Antarctic.

Because sea ice is made of frozen seawater, it is salty (unlike icebergs). Sea ice generally grows in the winter (when it is often dark all day and night) and melts in the summer (when there is twenty-four hour daylight). Sea ice normally covers more area near in the Antarctic than the Arctic. Because the ice is salty, sea ice is heavier, less transparent and easier to break than ice that isn't salty.

The 'mechanical properties' of sea ice refer to how easy it is to bend, break, squash and stretch the ice. This behaviour is dominated by the fact that sea ice is not entirely solid - instead it contains lots of tiny pockets of salt water. Older ice also often contains many air bubbles. This makes it much easier to squash, break and snap than a normal ice cube in a drink.

When two pieces of sea ice squash up against each other, they can crumple up and break to form a 'ridge' at the part where they touch. Before doing this they might bend. It is also relatively easy to pull apart a single piece of sea ice by pulling opposite edges in opposite directions.

Because sea ice has air bubbles and saltwater pockets inside it, it is much harder to see through than non-salty, clear ice. This is because light can't go through it without hitting the bubbles and pockets. Most sea ice in winter is covered by a layer of snow, which you also can't see through. All this means that when the sun shines on sea ice, not much of its light gets through to the sea below the ice. This limits the amount of algae and tiny plants that can grow in the sea. This is important because when the ice melts, much more light gets through and the algae and tiny plants can then thrive. This effect also keeps the sea below cooler.

Around four million people live in the Arctic, with many of them living near the sea. Many of these people have lived here for centuries, and have learned to use and depend on the sea ice to live. In particular, coastal residents of the Arctic travel over the sea ice and use it to hunt animals. This hunting is done both for food and to make clothes. Because some people spent a lot of their lives on the ice, it becomes very important to them and their communities.

May animals live on top of and under the sea ice. It makes life more difficult for some, but less difficult for others. Animals like seals and polar bears exist both on top of the sea ice, but also swim in the sea. Because microscopic plants and algae don't grow well under the sea ice because they need the sun, the animals that eat them (like fish) also spend less time under the ice.

Although it's not smooth like a mirror, sea ice is very shiny. Most of the sunlight that hits it bounces off and shines back into space. By not absorbing a lot of sunlight, the poles stay cold. Having cold regions near the top and bottom of the earth is important for global weather, because it affects the way cold and warm air moves around. When cold air moves down from the Arctic, it can cause very serious storms. When warm air moves up into the Arctic, it can cause the sea ice to melt and break up.

Sea ice also acts as a barrier between the sea and the air. In the rest of the world, water is often evaporating from the sea to the air. Eventually when the air fills up with water, it rains. Sea ice strongly reduces this transfer, so the air is very dry and it doesn't rain or snow very much.

Sea ice also reduces the amount of heat that flows from the sea to the air.

Sea ice is important for the mixing of the sea surface. When wind blows over the sea, it stirs the water and mixes it up. However when wind blows sea ice around, this mixing is much deeper, and the strength can change. This mixing is important because it affects the lives of microscopic animals that live at the sea surface, and it also affects how salty it is at the sea surface.

Human beings have been releasing a lot of greenhouse gases, which have been making the earth warmer. The Arctic in particular has been getting much warmer. One reason for this is because sea ice formation and melting is very sensitive to temperature changes. When the air is warmer, sea ice grows slower and melts faster.

These temperature rises mean that the sea ice begins growing later in the year, and begins melting earlier in the year. It also means that the area of sea ice is decreasing.

Going to the sea ice is difficult and sometimes dangerous. This makes it impossible to keep track of all the sea ice at once and see how its changing. To solve this, scientists often look at sea ice from space using satellites. There are many ways to do this. Some satellites use cameras that work similarly to common consumer ones. Others make pictures of the sea ice using microwave energy that can go through clouds. Some don't just look at the ice, but send down energy from laser and radar machines and then record how it bounces off the ice.

These satellites allow scientists to measure the area covered by sea ice relatively well. However they are still relatively unsure how thick the sea ice is, in part because it is unclear how much snow is resting on the ice at any one time. Measuring the amount of snow that exists on sea ice is difficult, European scientists are currently designing a new satellite called CRISTAL to help study it.

The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals

The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals is Charles Darwin's third major work of evolutionary theory, following "On the Origin of Species" (1859) and "The Descent of Man" (1871).

Darwin had intended it as a section of "The Descent of Man". However, that book was already quite long: it was published in two volumes. So the "Expression of the Emotions" was published separately in 1872.

The book is about the way emotional life is shown by the faces and actions of man and other mammals. Darwin sets out ideas that our systems of emotions are inherited, and have evolved in a similar way to the more familiar structural aspects of man and animals.

He explores the origins of such human characteristics as the lifting of the eyebrows in moments of surprise and the mental confusion which typically accompanies blushing. The book is very notable for being the first book to use photographs as the main way of showing scientific evidence. The field of study is now called "behavioural genetics". One line of evidence he uses is the way many different peoples in different parts of the world have similar facial and emotional reactions.

Darwin's basic points were: a single origin for the entire human species, and universal human expressions. Also, there are obvious links between the way human emotions are shown and the way other mammals show their emotions. Our emotional displays are adapted from a more basic set of emotional displays common to many mammals. The emotional displays are inherited, automatic and are difficult to control with our conscious mind. They are operated by the more ancient unconscious mind. Modern research has shown that it is extremely difficult to avoid giving signs of our emotions.

A German translation of "The Expression" appeared in 1872; Dutch and French versions followed in 1873 and 1874. A second edition of the book, with only minor alterations, was published in 1890.

Dream Market

Dream Market is an online darknet market started in late 2013. Dream Market works on a hidden service of the Tor network. This allows online users to browse anonymously and securely while dodging possible monitoring of traffic. The marketplace sells many things, including drugs, stolen data, and fake goods, using the Bitcoin, BitcoinCash and Monero cryptocurrencies. Dream provides an escrow service, with disputes handled by staff. The market also has forums, hosted on a different URL.

After the takeovers and shutdowns of the AlphaBay and Hansa markets in July 2017, there was much speculation that Dream Market would become the main darknet marketplace. Many sellers and buyers from AlphaBay and Hansa communities registered on Dream Market.

At the time, Dream Market was reported to have "57,000 listings for drugs and 4,000 listings for opioids".

Dream Administrator and vendor Gal Vallerius was arrested in August 2017, after a border search of his laptop confirmed his identity as online drug seller OxyMonster. $500,000 USD in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin was discovered on his laptop. Vallerius is the subject of an continuing investigation about large online narcotics purchases which began in February 2016.

After the recent seizures of other markets, the accounts of a number of Dream Market vendors came under the control of Dutch law enforcement. As the market remains in operation, and no official statement has been released by Dutch authorities regarding this matter, it is not known how these accounts were compromised, though some researchers suggest that shared credentials are to blame.

On September 13th, Dream users reported the loss of funds from their accounts in posts to forums such as reddit. In a post to the markets' news page, Staff later confirmed that a hard drive failure caused the issue and promised to refund the lost funds. The issue has not yet been resolved, and it is not known how many (if any) users have had their prior balance compensated.

Tracheid

Tracheids are long cells in the xylem of vascular plants. They transport water and mineral salts. Tracheids are one of two types of elements in the xylem, vessel elements being the other. Tracheids do not have perforation plates; vessel elements do. These define vascular plants, as opposed to non-vascular plants.

All tracheary elements get a thick lignified cell wall. When the plant is mature, the protoplast has broken down and disappeared. Tracheids have two functions. They transport material and provide structural support.

The secondary walls have thickenings in various forms: rings, spirals, networks or as extensive thickenings except where there are pits. Tracheids provide most of the structural support in softwoods, where they are the major cell type.

Because tracheids have a much larger surface area to volume ratio compared to vessel elements, they hold water against gravity (by adhesion) when transpiration is not occurring. This mechanism helps plants prevent air embolisms.

The term "tracheid" was introduced by Carl Sanio in 1863, originally as "Tracheide", in German.

Oldest dated rocks

The oldest dated rocks on Earth are of several different types.

1. There are early rocks recovered from the Moon. This is relevant because the Moon was once part of the Earth: see giant impact hypothesis. During Apollo 16, Lunar sample 67215, dated at 4.46 billion years, was brought back. Lunar sample 67215 is the oldest known rock on Earth, even though it came from the Moon.

2. The oldest material of terrestrial origin that has been dated is a zircon mineral 4.404 ±0.008 billion years old. It was in the Jack Hills of Western Australia. The oldest consistently-dated zircon is closer to 4.35 billion years ago. 

3. The oldest rock formation on Earth may be the Acasta Gneiss in the Canadian Shield in the Northwest Territories, Canada.

Luminous red nova

A luminous red nova ("LRN") is an explosion in space. It is probably caused when two stars merge to become one. Their red colour is distinctive. The light curve near the star stays in the infared. Luminous red novae are different from normal novae. Those are explosions on the surface of white dwarf stars.

The first luminous red nova found was in the Messier 85 galaxy. It was discovered when people working at the Rickett Observatory were searching for supernovas. Astronomers from U.C. Berkeley and Caltech investigated it. They found that it was different from normal novae and thermal pulses. Afterwards, they announced that luminous red novae are a new type of star explosion.

More luminous red novae were found after the discovery. Researchers found V1309 Scorpii in 2008. The star system was a contact binary. Researchers were studying it for six years before it merged and exploded. In 2015, two different luminous red novae were found. One was in the Andromeda galaxy, and the other was in the Pinwheel galaxy. Astronomers think that in 2022, KIC 9832227 will merge and become a new luminous red nova. This star system is 1800 light years away from the Sun. A team from Calvin College found that the orbital period of the star system was slowing down and that the stars were coming closer to each other.

Luminous red novae have these traits:

Thus, in the illustration on the right, each serif letter has a serif on the end of its lines. Alphabetic typefaces either have serifs or not. Those without are called sans-serif.

The design of our typefaces started in the 15th century, when the early printers used moulds from which letters made of lead were produced.

However, the original source of the serif may be in monumental inscriptions. Serifs are on the letters at the base of Trajan's column (built 107~113 AD), and are clearly illustrated in standard textbooks on typography. Indeed, older literature often describes typefaces with serifs as "Roman". The word "serif" seems to be an early 19th century innovation.

Excavations in 2006 suggested the time of building as 792852 AD. In the 820s, the Mercian king Coenwulf was fighting against a resurgent Welsh threat. That may have been the reason for the dyke. However, all previous datings suggested its being built much earlier, in the post-Roman era.

Welsh Marches

The Welsh Marches is the area round the boundary between England and Wales. It is not very well defined. The border between the two countries has constantly altered, and many of the small towns have been, at various times, on one side or the other.

On the English side. the area was the Kingdom of Mercia. The fortifications known as Wat's Dyke and Offa's Dyke were built by Mercian kings. The market towns on the English side (such as Shrewsbury and Hereford) were garrisoned.

The term "March of Wales" was used in the Domesday Book of 1086. Over the next four centuries the Norman rulers established Earldoms for the "Marcher Lords", whose job it was to patrol the Marches. Dozens of small castles were built in the border area in the 12th and 13th centuries. From the castles the Norman lords could patrol and defend the area against against Welsh raiders and rebels.

Under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 under Henry VIII, rule by the marcher lords was abolished in 1536. This had the effect of creating a single state and legal jurisdiction, "England and Wales". The powers of the marcher lordships were abolished, and their areas were organised into the new Welsh counties of Denbighshire, Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire, Brecknockshire, Monmouthshire, and Carmarthenshire.

In present-day Britain, the boundary between England and Wales is more or less ignored. In fact, one can cross the border without knowing it, except that painted on the roads on the Welsh side are strange words such as "Arif". Throughout Wales, all official messages are printed in both English and Welsh.

Considering the offenses it is in charge of, it has the particularity of exercising its activity within the legal framework of universal jurisdiction. It regularly sends his investigators abroad using international rogatory commissions, to places where the facts have been committed. There, in co-operation with the local authorities, it gathers the elements useful to the manifestation of the truth. 

Like the Central Office for Combating Environmental Crime and Public Health (OCLAESP), the Central Office for Combating Illegal Labor (OCLTI) and the , the OCLCH is attached to the sub-directorate of the Judicial Police of the Directorate General of the National Gendarmerie.

The OCLCH maintains specific international relations and in particular with the foreign judicial units specialized in this same field. It is the single point of entry into France for its foreign counterparts (american FBI, german BKA, ...). As a mirror image, it is the recipient of requests for mutual legal assistance addressed to France by foreign states or international institutions (International Criminal Court (ICC), International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), EULEX Kosovo, etc.).

Led by a brigadier general (NATO nomenclature: OF6) from the Gendarmerie Nationale, the general Jean-Philippe Reiland, the Office staff consists of 30+ civil servants, coming from the gendarmerie, the national police and the Ministry of Defense. It is completed by operational reservists.

In August 2020 a division was created within the OCLCH dedicated to the fight against hate crimes, in particular racist, anti-Semitic, anti-religious or LGBT-phobic acts. This creation was motivated by the fact that, although the decree creating the OCLCH already included the fight against hate crimes in its missions, there were relatively few commitments by the office on these subjects, because it gave priority to the fight against crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes. However, the increase in hate crimes over the years, which have been poorly taken into account, led to the decision to specialise a group of gendarmes on this particular mission, with a strong emphasis on monitoring social networks. There are seven gendarmes who investigate full-time in this division. The division can be contacted in different ways: either by a report on the Pharos platform, or by the public prosecutor's office to which a complaint has been filed. Its work is done in collaboration with the national centre for combating online hate. 

On 21 December 2021, by Decree No. 2021-1738, the Prime Minister amended Decree No. 2013-987 of 5 November 2013 creating the OCLCH. This text clarifies the scope of the missions of this central office in terms of hate crimes, by setting out precisely the offences for which it is competent in this area. It also adds crimes of enforced disappearance to the list of the most serious international crimes for which the OCLCH has jurisdiction. 

The new decree also changes the name of this central office to "Central Office for Combating Crimes against Humanity and Hate Crimes" to better reflect its focus and activity.

Die beste Show der Welt

Die beste Show der Welt (English:"The best show of the world") is the name of a German television show, which was first broadcast on April 30, 2016 on the private channel ProSieben. In the program, presenters Joachim Winterscheidt and Klaas Heufer-Umlauf present three independent show concepts. The studio audience decides after all six shows have been presented, which show wins the title of the "best show in the world" or the "worst show in the world". Every spectator in the audience has a voting device. These "remote controls" can also be used for the interactive design of the show. The moderator is Jeannine Michaelsen. In the third and fourth edition, Oliver Kalkofe commented on the events and judged the respective shows.

The program is produced by Florida TV and was awarded the German Television Prize in 2017.

Joko Winterscheidt and Klaas Heufer-Umlauf present three shows each with a length of about 20 to 30 minutes. The presented shows are partly new show ideas, but are also based on existing TV show formats, which are slightly modified and parodied. At the same time, the two of them may force each other to participate in a show once per appointment ("Joker").

In the first four episodes, the studio audience with voting devices determined the audience for the show shown, which was the TV viewer at home live as a graphic superimposed. This graphic was removed with Issue 5 of December 2, 2017. Each of the 600 people in the studio could switch on or off during the show, as if sitting at home in front of the TV, using their voting device, which acts like a remote control. Over the entire running time of the show could be switched on or off as often as they like. The course of the ratings was therefore close to how good or bad the show arrived at the studio audience. This was only visible to the television viewer at home, not for the studio audience. Until the second instalment of the program, a "cloud of light" consisting of white spheres fixed above the studio and illuminated with lasers was installed in the studio, which visualized the audience rating by their brightness. The more spectators from the studio audience turned on, the brighter the cloud of light became. Since the third edition, these are no longer available. At the end of a show, the average ratings are calculated and announced. The highest rating wins. Should the audience rate drop below 25% during a show, it will enter a "red area" (colored red on the graphic). This is now also audiovisually signaled in the studio (light turns red and the picture on the video wall in the background falls apart). If the ratings stay below 25% for more than one minute, the show must be cancelled and considered "cancelled". 

Since the fifth episode no quota is generated during the show. Instead, viewers in the audience at the end of the show choose the show they like best from all six concepts presented. "The worst show in the world" is also determined.

Joko or Klaas win a trophy for the "Best Show in the World", the German Television Award in an oversized version (referred to in the show as the "German Television Prize in XXL") as a parody of the real German Television Award.

Linea dell'Impero

The Linea dell'Impero(in English: "Flight of the Empire" or simply "Empire Line") was the longest flight made by the Italian airline "Ala Littoria" (precursor of Alitalia) in the years preceding World War II and was considered the most prestigious Italian air route of the time. It connected Rome with Mogadiscio in Italian East Africa, and from 1939 the route could be travelled without a change of airplane. The route was a key political and symbolic connection between Rome, the 'capital of Italy's Empire', and Italy's colonies in Libya and East Africa.

The line was opened after the Italian conquest of Ethiopia in 1936 and was followed by the first air links with the Italian colonies in Italian East Africa, which had begun in an experimental way from 1934. The route was enlarged to 6,379 km and initially joined Rome with Addis Ababa via Syracuse, Benghazi, Cairo, Wadi Halfa, Khartoum, Kassala, Asmara, Dire Dawa. There was a change of aircraft in Benghazi (or sometimes in Tripoli).

The route was carried out in three and a half days of daytime flight and the frequency was four flights per week in both directions. Later from Addis Ababa there were three flights a week that continued to Mogadishu, capital of Italian Somalia.

In 1939 the time taken to travel the route was reduced with the introduction of the new Savoia-Marchetti "Marsupiale", an aircraft that did not require change of aircraft. The flight lasted just 2 days and connected Rome to Tripoli-Cairo-Kassala-Asmara-Addis Abeba-Mogadiscio. In early 1940 it was the fastest and longest route in Africa and was the most prestigious line of Italian civil aviation.

In summer 1940, with the start of WWII the route was militarized and controlled by the "Comando Servizi Aerei Speciali". In the first months of 1941 it was definitively closed when Italy lost the Africa Orientale Italiana.

The Empire Line was opened using the three-engined seaplane CANT Z.506 in the stretch Rome – Benghazi/Tripoli and the three-engined land-based Savoia-Marchetti SM-73 from Benghazi/Tripoli to Addis Abeba and Africa Orientale Italiana.

In 1938 entered service the faster Savoia-Marchetti SM-75 with greater autonomy, capable of carrying a nearly 5000 kg load of mail and up to twenty-four passengers. This aircraft was used from the beginning of 1939 and made it possible -thanks to improved flight authonomy and top speed of 370kmh- to eliminate the change of aircraft, to reduce the number of stopovers and to shorten the travel time of a full day.

Fruitafossor

Fruitafossor was a termite-eating mammal of North America during the Upper Jurassic epoch (about 150 million years ago).

The description is based on a surprisingly complete skeleton of a chipmunk-sized animal. It was discovered in 2005, in Fruita, Colorado. 

The animal looked like an armadillo (or anteater) and probably ate termites in much the same manner as these animals do today (ants had not yet evolved). Other skeletal features clearly show that "Fruitafossor" was not related to armadillos, anteaters, or any modern group of mammal. This means that specializations associated with feeding on ants or termites have evolved many times in mammals: in "Fruitafossor", anteaters, numbats, aardvarks, pangolins, and echidnas.

La Llorona (song)

"La Llorona" (lit. "The weeping woman") is a Mexican folk song. The song began in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Its origins are unknown, but composer Andres Henestrosa in about 1940 popularized the song and may have added to the existing verses.

One popular interpretation of the song is of the singer feeling trapped by this woman (La Llorona) who has fallen in love with him. If he even thinks about leaving her, she weeps. He tries everything in his power to leave her, but he is trapped by pity for the woman.

Another interpretation is that someone who was so in love with La Llorona climed the highest pine tree to see her, but because the pine tree was young and not solid enough, fell and lost their life. Thus proving that even in death, the admirer still loves La Llorona. "Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona no dejaré de quererte."

The song “La Llorona” is featured in the 2017 Disney-Pixar movie "Coco"; it is performed by Alanna Ubach (in the English version) and Angélica Vale (in the Spanish version) as Imelda Rivera.

Peshmerga

Peshmerga () are the military forces of the federal region of Iraqi Kurdistan. The Peshmerga and other Kurdish security forces are responsible for the security of the regions in Iraqi Kurdistan. These forces include Asayish (intelligence agency), "Parastin u Zanyarî" (assisting intelligence agency) and the Zeravani (military police). The peshmerga was started in 1943, but built upon a traditional, strictly tribal pseudo-military border guard under the Ottomans and Safavids.

The regular Iraqi army is forbidden to enter Iraqi Kurdistan, so Peshmerga forces are the only security forces in the area.

Formally the peshmerga are under the command of the Kurdistan Regional Government's Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs. In reality the peshmerga force itself is largely divided and controlled separately by the two regional political parties: Democratic Party of Kurdistan and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Unifying and integrating the peshmerga has been on the public agenda since 1992 but the forces remain divided due to factionalism which has proved to be a major stumbling block.

In 2003, during the Iraq War, peshmerga were said to have played a key role in the mission to capture Saddam Hussein. In 2004, they captured key al Qaeda figure Hassan Ghul, who revealed the identity of Osama Bin Laden's messenger, which eventually led to the attack that killed Osama Bin Laden. In 2017 Peshmerga troops were part of the coalition that took back Mosul from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

The tenon, on the end of a member (called a rail), fits into a square or rectangular hole in the corresponding member. The tenon is cut to fit the mortice hole exactly and usually has shoulders that seat when the joint fully enters the mortice hole. The joint may be glued, pinned, or wedged to lock it in place.

Omega Centauri

Omega Centauri (ω Cen or NGC 5139) is a globular cluster in the constellation of Centaurus. It is 15,800 light-years (4,850 pc) away, and is the largest globular cluster in the Milky Way. Its diameter is about 150 light-years. It contains about 10 million stars with a total mass equivalent to 4 million solar masses.

Omega Centauri is so different from the other galactic globular clusters that it may have a different origin from the others. It may be a core remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy.

In 150 A.D. Greco-Roman writer and astronomer Ptolemy catalogued this object in his "Almagest". Using a telescope from the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena, English astronomer Edmond Halley rediscovered this object in 1677, listing it as a non-stellar object. In 1715, it was published by Halley among his list of six "luminous spots or patches" in the "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society".

Omega Centauri is one of the few globular clusters visible to the naked eye. It appears almost as large as the full Moon when seen from a dark, rural area. It is the brightest, largest and, at 4 million solar masses, the most massive known globular cluster in the Milky Way. Of all the globular clusters in the Local Group of galaxies, only Mayall II (orbiting the Andromeda Galaxy) is brighter and more massive. Orbiting through the Milky Way, Omega Centauri contains several million Population II stars and is about 12 billion years old.

The stars in the core of Omega Centauri are so crowded that they are on average only 0.1 light years away from each other.

Treaty of Lausanne

The Treaty of Lausanne was a peace treaty signed in 1923 in Switzerland's city Lausanne, after Turkey had won the Greco-Turkish War in 1919 to 1922. It settles the border between Greece and Turkey and the other borders of Turkey. Other countries that signed the treaty were Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Japan and Yugoslavia.

Felony Disenfranchisement in Florida

In the State of Florida, persons convicted of a felony are stripped of their voting rights in addition to other sentencing. This restriction lasts for life, and the right can only be restored through special permissions from both the governor and the state clemency board. This practice is known as felony disenfranchisement and it is a common punishment across the United States, being law in 48 states (not practiced in Vermont and Maine). However, Florida is one of only twelve states that bans convicted felons from voting post-sentence and one of only four that maintains that ban for life.

Florida’s constitution was ratified in 1838 and with that felony disenfranchisement was established in Florida. Article VI section 13 of the original state constitution states, “Laws shall be made by the General Assembly, to exclude from office, and from suffrage, those who shall have been or may thereafter be convicted of bribery, perjury, forgery, or other high crime, or misdemeanor.” This law took effect in 1845 when Florida became a U.S. State and remained largely intact despite notable wording changes in 1868 and 1968 until 2007. In 2007, governor Charlie Crist amended the rules for executive clemency to permit felons to vote upon the completion of their full sentences.

Relative dating

Relative dating is the kind of geochronology that determines the relative order of past events. The idea is to find the age of an object or event by comparing it to another object or event, or by using clues from the environment or circumstances where it was found. Relative dating is not about finding the absolute age. In geology, rock or superficial deposits, fossils and lithologies can be used to correlate one stratigraphic column with another. Before the discovery of radiometric dating in the early 20th century, archaeologists and geologists used relative dating to determine ages of materials. 

Radiometric dating, on the other hand, is a means of absolute dating. Relative dating can only determine the "order" in which a series of events occurred, not "when" they occurred. Even so, it remains a useful technique. Relative dating by biostratigraphy is the preferred method in paleontology and is, in some respects, more accurate. Steno's Law of Superposition states that older layers will be deeper in a site than more recent layers. This law was the 'relative dating' method of choice in geology from the 17th century to the early 20th century

Swim bladder

The swim bladder (gas bladder, air bladder) is an internal gas-filled organ. It helps many bony fish (but not cartilaginous fish) to control their buoyancy.

Fish with a swim bladder can stay at their current water depth without having to waste energy in swimming. The dorsal position of the swim bladder means the center of mass is below the center of volume, so it acts as a stabilizing agent. Also, the swim bladder is a resonating chamber, to produce or receive sound.

Swim bladders are evolutionarily closely related (i.e., homologous) to lungs. Traditional wisdom has it that the first lungs (simple sacs connected to the gut) allowed the fish to gulp air in oxygen-poor conditions. They evolved into the lungs of today's terrestrial vertebrates and some fish (lungfish, gar, bichir) and also into the swim bladders of the ray-finned fishes.

Silhouette

A silhouette is an image in outline only, usually filled in as black on a white background.

The inside of a silhouette is featureless.It differs from an outline. That shows the edge of an object in line form, but a silhouette is a solid shape. Silhouette images may be made in any visual artistic medium. The word was first used to describe pieces of cut paper, which were then stuck to a backing in a contrasting colour, and often framed.

Cutting portraits, generally in profile, from black card became popular in the mid-18th century. They were a cheap alternative to the portrait miniature. Skilled specialist artists could cut a high-quality bust portrait in a matter of minutes. Other artists, especially about 1790, drew an outline on paper, then painted it in, which could also be done quickly.

From its original graphic meaning, the term "silhouette" has been extended to describe the sight or representation of a person, object or scene that is backlit, and appears dark against a lighter background. Anything that appears this way, for example, a figure standing backlit in a doorway, may be described as "in silhouette".

Hotarubi no Mori e

An anime movie that had the same name as the manga was created. It was 44 minutes and it was released in 2011. It was made in a studio called Brain's Base. The director of the movie was Takahiro Omori. The main voice actors of the movie were Ayane Sakura and Kōki Uchiyama. Some of the music in the movie was made by Makoto Yoshimori. Many people enjoyed the movie and many people were big fans for a long time after the movie was released. The movie came out on 17 September 2011. It was showed at the Scotland Loves Animation festival, the Leeds International Film Festival, Anime Expo, and the 66th Mainichi Film Awards.

The movie came out on blu-ray and DVD in Japan. This was on 22 February 2012. An extra story that was called also came out. This came out in a special version of the manga. The special manga and the blu-ray were on number 13 of the Oricon list. People that reviewed the movie said that the movie was very good. They said that it was a beautiful and simple movie. They compared the movie to movies by Hayao Miyazaki and Makoto Shinkai.

The original manga and movie have the same story. A six-year-old girl called Hotaru Takegawa gets lost in a forest. Many "yamagami" and "yōkai" live in this forest. A person wearing a mask called Gin finds Hotaru. Gin tells Hotaru that if she touches him, he will disappear. He helps Hotaru get out of the forest. Later, Hotaru keeps visiting Gin in the forest. They become friends, but Hotaru has to go back home in the city for school. Hotaru promises Gin that she will keep coming back each year.

Hotaru grows up but Gin doesn't grow. Hotaru's age quickly becomes closer to Gin's age. When Hotaru becomes a teenager, she finds it hard to keep their friendship together. This might be because they love each other a little bit and that their future together seemed very uncertain. Gin wishes that he could touch and hold Hotaru, but he cannot. One year, Gin takes Hotaru out on a date in a festival. This festival was organised by the spirits. Gin accidentally touches a human boy. He disappears, but he and Hotaru hug. They both tell each other that they loved one another. Hotaru soon moves on with her life near the end of the story.

In , the story is told from Gin's point of view. When Hotaru leaves after the summer, some of the "yōkai" try to cheer Gin up. They give him some persimmons. Persimmons were a very special treat on the mountain. Gin wants to share a persimmon with Hotaru next year. He goes up to the top of a mountain to find ice so that he can preserve a persimmon but he could not find any ice. One of the spirits named Matsumino feels sorry for him and tries to bring the persimmon to Hotaru. Matsumino gets lost on the way there and eats the persimmon. At the end of the story, Hotaru comes back the next summer. Gin thinks about if he can tell Hotaru that he loves her.

The author of "Hotarubi no Mori e" said that the idea for the story came to her really easily. She said this in the postscript of "Aizoban Hotarubi no Mori e". She said that she wanted to write a harder story when she had more experience in writing manga. She wrote it before she thought she would because she was scared that she would lose the idea. There were not too many issues while she was writing even though she had many different ideas. Midorikawa wanted to draw many different scenes in the story. She wanted to do a forest in the summer that had a lot of shadows. This was because she wanted to add more colours in the manga. She also wanted to do a calm summer festival and Gin's mask.

Many people think the love story between Hotaru and Gin was the starting point for "Natsume's Book of Friends". This is because both stories have humans and "yōkai" interact together. In both of these stories, there are many differences between the characters. Many things stop their relationships and how they understand each other.

Midorikawa wrote another part of the story in 2011. This was before the anime movie's release. It was called "Hotarubi no Mori e Tokubetsuhen". She didn't want to add to the story at first, because the story was already finished. Because of this, she wrote from Gin's point of view.

The animation director, who was Yumi Satou, said that he began making the anime because he liked to animate original manga. The movie was approved in the beginning of 2011. The movie's producer (Shuko Yokoyama) said that the movie was supposed to be an original video animation. If it was made as an original video animation, it would not be released in theatres. But another movie, "Natsume's Book of Friends" was very popular and it allowed them to make a movie.

Unlike most other women in Roman society, the Vestals were forbidden to marry or bear children, and took a vow of chastity when they joined the priesthood, which lasted for a minimum of 30 years.

They were daughters chosen before puberty from a number of suitable candidates, from two living parents who both had to be free-born residents (not slaves or freed slaves) of Rome. Before the 3rd century BC, candidates for Vestal priesthoods had to be of patrician birth. Membership was opened to plebeians in the 3rd century BC.

They retired when their term of service ended after 30 years. Vestals who retired, typically in their late 30's to early 40s, were allowed to marry, but were often too old to bear children.

Mental capacity

Mental capacity in law is a term used to describe a person's ability to make decisions for themselves and to understand what those decisions will mean for them.

Sometimes, people who are unwell, such as those with illnesses which affect their memory (Alzheimer's disease or Dementia), those with learning difficulties, or who have mental health problems, may find themselves in a position where their ability to make decisions for themselves is questioned. This may be because they do not understand that what they are doing is not good for them; they do not realise that it might make them ill or get them into trouble.

People can also lack capacity if they are unable to communicate in any way; for example, if they're in a coma or if they have severe brain damage. In this case, it may be necessary for someone else, such as an advocate or a Judge to make decisions for them by making a court order.

In some countries, like the United Kingdom, laws exist which tell those working with people whose capacity might be in doubt, what they must do and how to decide if someone is capable of making their own decisions. In the UK, this law is called the Mental Capacity Act (2005). It lists 5 rules which must be used as a guide; in simple terms, they are:


This law also allows people who have capacity, to pick someone else to make their decisions for them, in the case that they can't do it themselves.

Supposing a person is unable to make decisions for themselves, what happens then? In the UK (and many other countries) there is a legal framework to make sure no-one takes advantage of the said person. It often consists of a physician or psychiatrist dealing with the person in question, a solicitor representing the person, and a solicitor representing the "public interest" (the state). Meetings are held at agreed times, say once every three months. The purpose is to make sure that decisions taken are in the person's interest.

Violette Szabo

Violette Reine Elizabeth Szabo GC (née Bushell; 26 June 1921 – February 1945) was a French/British agent during the Second World War. Her role was known as Special Operations Executive (SOE). She was twice parachuted into France to help the French resistance activity against German forces (the Wehrmacht).

During her second mission, Szabo was caught by the Germans. She was interrogated, and sent to Ravensbrück concentration camp in Germany, where she was treated harshly. Like most other prisoners, she had to perform hard work in freezing cold conditions with few clothes. She was shot near the end of the war. After her death, she was awarded the George Cross, the Croix de Guerre and the Medaille de la Resistance.

Szabo's father was British, and her mother was French.

Violette Szabo was born Violette Reine Elizabeth Bushell in Paris on 26 June 1921. Her father was a taxi-driver and car salesman, and her mother was a dressmaker. During her childhood, Violette lived in both France and England at different times. She could speak both languages well. When the Second World War broke out, she was working at "Le Bon Marché", a Brixton department store.

Szabo married Étienne Szabo in 1940. He was a Hungarian non-commissioned officer in the French Foreign Legion. Violette was 19, Étienne was 31.

After her marriage, Violette became a switchboard operator for the General Post Office in central London, working throughout the blitz. Bored by the job, she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) on 11 September 1941. Szabo found within weeks that she was pregnant, so she left the ATS to return to London for the birth.

Violette sent her baby to childminders while she worked at the South Morden aircraft factory where her father was stationed. Then she was told of her husband's death in action. Étienne had died on 24 October 1942 at the beginning of the Second Battle of El Alamein; he had never seen his daughter. It was Étienne's death that made Violette accept an offer to train as a field agent in the British Special Operations Executive (SOE). It was her best way to fight the enemy.

Szabo was sent to the SOE "finishing school" at Beaulieu, Hampshire, where she learnt escape and evasion, uniform recognition, communications and cryptography. She had training in weaponry. The final stage in training was parachute jumping. On her first attempt, Szabo badly sprained her ankle and was sent home to recover (it was this ankle that was to fail her later in France). She was able to take the parachuting course again and passed with a second class in February 1944.

In 2012 Max Hastings wrote that Szabo was "adored by the men and women of SOE both for her courage and endless infectious Cockney laughter", while Leo Marks remembered her as "A dark-haired slip of mischief...She had a Cockney accent which added to her impishness".

Szabo was only the second woman to be awarded the George Cross. Both Violette and Étienne Szabo were awarded the French Croix de Guerre for their bravery in the field. On 17 December 1947 their five-year-old daughter Tania received the George Cross from King George VI on behalf of her late mother. Violette and Étienne Szabo are believed to be the most decorated married couple of World War II.

Antonio Bernocchi

Antonio Bernocchi was an Italian industrialist, who built up a successful textile factory at Legnano, a city in the Lombardy region of northern Italy.

Bernocchi was born on 17 January 1859 at Castellanza in the province of Varese, in Lombardy in northern Italy. He was one of three sons of Rodolfo Bernocchi and Angela Colombo.

Bernocchi attended the Scuola Tecnica of Busto Arsizio, but did not complete his education. By the age of fifteen he was working for his father in a small workshop for bleaching textiles at Legnano. In 1898 the family started a textile factory at Legnano. The business became very successful, which was successful and grew substantially. Factories were opened at Nerviano, Cerro Maggiore and Angera. Bernocchi became mayor of Legnano and a member of the Italian Senate.

Bernocchi made several charitable donations. After the Italian defeat at Caporetto in World War I, he donated to a new charity for war veterans, La Patria Riconoscente. The charity was later called the Opera Nazionale Combattenti. He gave funds for the establishment or expansion of schools and hospitals in Legnano, where two schools are named after him. He was a benefactor of La Scala in Milan. His biggest donation was five million lire to the city of Milan for the construction of the Palazzo dell'Arte, home of the Triennale exhibition, in the Parco Sempione. The pavilion, also known as Palazzo Bernocchi, was designed by Giovanni Muzio and built between 1931 and 1933.

Buruli ulcer

Buruli ulcer is an infectious disease caused by bacteria. These bacteria are related to the ones that cause leprosy and those that cause tuberculosis. The disease can be found in tropical regions, but is not limited to the tropics. It is common in Africa, Southeast Asia and Australia. Currently, it is unknown in what way the disease spreads. It often occurs in rural areas close to swamps, rivers, or lakes. For this reason, vector organisms such as mosquitoes appear likely. However, M. ulcerans is an environmental bacterium and produces unique toxin – mycolactone. The way it transfers to humans remains unknown. Currently, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to minimizing death, costs and prevent long-term disability. 

There are different forms of therapy: the most common one is a combination of two or three different drugs and removing the affected tissue. Simple tissue removal works best when no ulcers have formed yet. The bacterium cannot live in temperatures above 40 °C. For this reason, some forms of therapy have included heating the affected skin parts above 40°C. This will kill the bacteria. First attempts suggest that after killing the bacteria, the ulcer will heal in several cases. Even 18 months after the treatment, the disease no longer shows. This means that the method can be tested on more people.<ref name="DOI10.1371/journal.pntd.0000380">Thomas Junghanss, Alphonse Um Boock, Moritz Vogel, Daniela Schuette, Helmut Weinlaeder, Gerd Pluschke, David J. Diemert: "Phase Change Material for Thermotherapy of Buruli Ulcer: A Prospective Observational Single Centre Proof-of-Principle Trial." In: "PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases." 3, 2009, S. e380, .</ref>

Buruli ulcer has been reported in 33 countries in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Western Pacific. Most cases occur in tropical and subtropical regions except in Australia, China and Japan. Out of the 33 countries, 14 regularly report data to WHO.
The yearly number of suspected Buruli ulcer cases reported globally was around 5000 cases until 2010. Then, it started to decrease until 2016, reaching its minimum with 1961 cases reported. Since then, the number of cases has started to rise again every year, up to 2713 cases in 2018. In 2020 1258 cases were reported compared with 2271 cases in 2019. The decrease in 2020 might be connected to Covid-19 decreasing how often new cases are found.
Mycobacterium ulcerans grows at temperatures between 29–33 °C (Mycobacterium tuberculosis grows at 37 °C) and needs a low (2.5%) oxygen concentration. The organism produces a unique toxin – mycolactone – which causes tissue damage and inhibits the immune response.

The exact mode of transmission of M. ulcerans is still unknown.
Buruli ulcer often starts as a painless swelling in a particular place (nodule), a large painless area of induration (plaque) or a painless swelling over a large area of the legs, arms or face (oedema). The disease may progress with no pain and fever. Without treatment or sometimes during antibiotics treatment, the nodule, plaque or oedema will ulcerate within 4 weeks. Bone is occasionally affected, causing deformities.
The disease has been classified into three categories of severity: Category I single small lesion (32%), Category II non-ulcerative and ulcerative plaque and oedematous forms (35%) and Category III disseminated and mixed forms such as osteitis, osteomyelitis and joint involvement (33%).
Lesions frequently occur in the limbs: 35% on the upper limbs, 55% on the lower limbs, and 10% on the other parts of the body. Health workers should be careful in the diagnosis of Buruli ulcer in patients with lower leg lesions to avoid confusion with other causes of ulceration such as diabetes, arterial and venous insufficiency lesion.

In most cases, experienced health professionals in the areas Buruli ulcers are common can make a reliable clinical diagnosis but training is essential.

Differential diagnoses of Buruli ulcer include tropical phagedenic ulcers, chronic lower leg ulcers due to arterial and venous insufficiency (often in elderly populations), diabetic ulcers, cutaneous leishmaniasis, extensive ulcerative yaws and ulcers caused by Haemophilus ducreyi.
Early nodular lesions may be confused with boils, lipomas, ganglions, lymph node tuberculosis, onchocerciasis nodules or deep fungal subcutaneous infections. 

In Australia, papular lesions may at first be confused with an insect bite.
HIV infection complicates the management of the patient, making clinical progression more aggressive and resulting in poor treatment outcomes. WHO has published a technical guide to help clinicians in the management of co-infection. 

Four standard laboratory methods can be used to confirm Buruli ulcer: IS2404 polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct microscopy, histopathology and culture.
Cellulitis may look like oedema caused by M. ulcerans infection but in the case of cellulitis, the lesions are painful and the patient is ill and febrile.

In 2019, WHO established the Buruli ulcer Laboratory Network for Africa 2 to help strengthen PCR confirmation in 9 endemic countries in Africa. 13 laboratories participate in this network - supported by the American Leprosy Missions, Anesvad, Raoul Follereau Foundation and the Foundation for Innovative Diagnostic and coordinated by the Pasteur Center of Cameroon.
In 2021, WHO completed on online consultation for a draft document on Target Product Profiles3 to develop rapid test for the diagnosis of Buruli ulcer. 

The final document to be published in 2022 will guide manufacturers in the development of appropriate diagnostic tests. With the availability of simple oral treatment for Buruli ulcer, a rapid test to allow early confirmation of diagnosis can facilitate the timely management of the disease. The turnaround time of a PCR test is too long.

Treatment consists of a combination of antibiotics and complementary treatments. Treatment guidance for health workers can be found in the WHO publication Treatment of mycobacterium ulcerans disease (Buruli ulcer).

A recent study suggests the combination of rifampicin (10 mg/kg once daily) and clarithromycin (7.5 mg/kg twice daily) is now the recommended treatment.

In Australia, a combination of rifampicin (10 mg/kg once daily) and moxifloxacin (400 mg once daily) is routinely used with good results but its effectiveness has not been proven.

Efforts to shorten the duration of treatment are in progress involving two studies:


Interventions such as wound and lymphoedema management and surgery (mainly debridement and skin grafting) are used to speed up healing, thereby shortening the duration of hospitalization. Physiotherapy is needed in severe cases to prevent disability. Those left with disability require long-term rehabilitation. These same interventions are applicable to other neglected tropical diseases, such as leprosy and lymphatic filariasis.

There are currently no primary preventive measures for Buruli ulcer. The mode of transmission is not known. Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination appears to provide limited protection.

The objective of Buruli ulcer control is to minimize the suffering, disabilities and socioeconomic burden. Early detection and antibiotic treatment are the cornerstones of the control strategy.

These are the core indicators to measure the progress in the control of Buruli ulcer;

WHO provides technical guidance, develops policies, and coordinates control and research efforts. WHO brings together all major actors involved in Buruli ulcer on a regular basis to share information, coordinate disease control and research efforts, and monitor progress.

WHO supports worked towards three research priorities:
To ensure efficiency, sustainability and scale, WHO recommends that Buruli ulcer control should be integrated within skin NTDs approach adapted to the diseases present in a particular country. WHO has developed a Skin App to assist health workers in the field in the diagnosis of skin NTDs including Buruli ulcer.

Special Operations Executive

The Special Operations Executive (SOE) was a British World War II organisation. It was officially formed on 22 July 1940 under Minister of Economic Warfare Hugh Dalton. It was formed by combining three existing secret organisations. Its purpose was to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance in occupied Europe against the Axis powers, and to aid local resistance movements. Later there were also reconnaissance missions in occupied Southeast Asia.

One of the organisations from which SOE was created was also involved in the formation of the Auxiliary Units, a top secret "stay-behind" resistance organisation which would have been activated in the event of a German invasion of Britain.

Few people were aware of SOE's existence. Those who were part of it or liaised with it sometimes referred to as the "Baker Street Irregulars", after the location of its London headquarters. It was also known as "Churchill's Secret Army" or the "Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare". Its various branches, and sometimes the organisation as a whole, were concealed for security purposes behind names such as the "Joint Technical Board" or the "Inter-Service Research Bureau", or fictitious branches of the Air Ministry, Admiralty or War Office.

SOE operated in all countries or former countries occupied by or attacked by the Axis forces, except where demarcation lines were agreed with Britain's principal Allies (the Soviet Union and the United States). It also made use of neutral territory on occasion, or made plans and preparations in case neutral countries were attacked by the Axis. The organisation directly employed or controlled just over 13,000 people, about 3,200 of whom were women.

After the war, the organisation was officially dissolved on 15 January 1946. A memorial to SOE's agents was unveiled on the Albert Embankment by Lambeth Palace in London in October 2009.

Berkeley County, West Virginia

Berkeley County is a county in West Virginia. It is the 2nd most populated county in West Virginia with the 2020 census reporting that 122,076 people lived in Berkeley County. The county seat is Martinsburg, West Virginia.

Berkeley County was formed from Frederick County, Virginia in 1772 and named for Lord Norborne Berkeley. For most of Berkeley County's history, Martinsburg has been its largest city. The arrival of the B&O Railroad in the 1840s gave Martinsburg and Berkeley County a significant economic boost. As the American Civil War was being fought, much of Berkeley county was ransacked and fought over. The first major battle in the area occurred on July 2, 1861, when the American General Robert Patterson crossed the Potomac River at Williamsport and defeated the Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston and General Thomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson. In the October of 1862, the Martinsburg B&O Railroad complex and Roundhouses were burned. After November 1863, Berkeley County became a part of West Virginia. Since then, Berkley County has experienced huge growth due to being close to the US capital, Washington, D.C. 

Berkeley County is located in a Humid subtropical climate. It has varying temperatures with an average high of 86 degrees in July, and a low of 22 degrees in January. Berkeley County receives rainfall all year, with summers being wetter that winter. It receives 26 inches of snow a year on average. Berkeley County also receives 39 inches of rain per year.

Piccolo trumpet

The Picolo trumpet is a smaller version of the trumpet, that is also tuned an octave higher than the regular trumpet. Since the 19th century, regular trumpets have three valves. The piccolo usually has four valves. Note also that the piccolo trumpet is different from the pocket trumpet. A pocket trumpet has the same tonal range as a regular trumpet; it is just built differently (to be smaller). 

A piccolo trumpet has another characteristic tone, which can easily be distinguished from that of a regular trumpet. 

The piccolo was developed in the first quarter of the 20th century, mostly by Julius Kosleck. Kosleck used it to make it easier to play baroque music. Note however, that at the time of Johann Sebastian Bach, the trumpets had no valves; these were added in the 19th century. 

Piccolo trumpets could not establish themselves in Jazz music, but they are often used to play classical trumpet. 

The trumpet is a "noble instrument"; it is often used to play high-pitched notes. Such notes are easier to play with a Piccolo. Because of its construction, the piccolo cannot play the first octave of the classical trumpet. 

Like the regular trumpet, the piccolo is a transposing instrument.

Lafcadio Hearn

Patrick Lafcadio Hearn (; ; 27 June 1850 – 26 September 1904) was a writer. People know him for his books about Japan, especially his collections of Japanese legends and ghost stories, such as "". In the United States, Hearn also wrote about the city of New Orleans. He also used the Japanese name .

Hearn was born in and named after the island of Lefkada, one of the Greek Ionian Islands, on 27 June 1850. He was the son of Surgeon-Major Charles Bush Hearn (of County Offaly, Ireland) and Rosa Antoniou Kassimatis, a Greek woman.

A complex series of conflicts and events led to Lafcadio Hearn being moved from Greece to Ireland, where he was abandoned first by his mother (leaving him in the care of her husband's aunt), then his father, and finally by his father's aunt, who had been appointed his official guardian.

In 1857, he was seven years old. Both his parents were still alive, but his great aunt, Sarah Brenane, took care of him. Hearn began exploring Brenane's library and read a lot of Greek literature, especially myths.

In 1861, Hearn's aunt sent him to the Institution Ecclésiastique, a Catholic church school in Yvetot, France. Hearn learned to dislike Catholic education. Hearn became fluent in French and would later translate into English the works of Guy de Maupassant, who coincidentally attended the school shortly after Hearn's departure.

In 1863, entered St. Cuthbert's College, Ushaw, a Catholic seminary at what is now the University of Durham. At age 16, Hearn injured his left eye in a schoolyard accident. The eye became infected. He left school for one year. He became blind in that eye. Hearn also myopia, so he had poor vision for the rest of his life. Hearn was embarrassed by his appearance, so he covered his left eye.

In 1867, Henry Molyneux, who had become Sarah Brenane's financial manager, went bankrupt, along with Brenane. There was no money for tuition, and Hearn was sent to London's East End to live with Brenane's former maid. She and her husband had little time or money for Hearn, who wandered the streets, spent time in workhouses, and generally lived an aimless, rootless existence. His main intellectual activities consisted of visits to libraries and the British Museum.

By 1869, Henry Molyneux had some money. He bought Hearn a one-way ticket to New York and told him to go to Cincinnati, find Molyneux's sister and her husband, Thomas Cullinan, and ask them for help. Cullinan gave him $5 and wished him luck. He was very poor and lived in stables or store rooms in exchange for hard work. 

Hearn lived in New Orleans for nearly a decade. He worked for several newspapers and magazines. He also translated the French author Gautier into English. Hearn also published in "Harper's Weekly" the first known written article (1883) about Filipinos in the United States, the Manilamen or Tagalogs, one of whose villages he had visited at Saint Malo, southeast of Lake Borgne in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana.

Harper's sent Hearn to the West Indies as a correspondent in 1887. He spent two years in Martinique, He wrote for the magazine and wrote two books: "Two Years in the French West Indies" and "Youma, The Story of a West-Indian Slave", both published in 1890.

In 1890, Hearn went to Japan as a newspaper correspondent. In Japan, he found a home and his greatest inspiration. Basil Hall Chamberlain helped Hearn get a teaching job during the summer of 1890 at the Shimane Prefectural Common Middle School and Normal School in Matsue. The Lafcadio Hearn Memorial Museum and his old home are still two of Matsue's most popular tourist attractions. In Matsue, Hearn married Koizumi Setsu, the daughter of a local samurai family. They had four children together. He became a naturalized Japanese and changed his name to Koizumi Yakumo, in 1896. He followed many religions: first Greek Orthodox, then Roman Catholic, and, later on, Spencerian. Finally, he became Buddhist.

During late 1891, Hearn started teaching in Kumamoto, Kyūshū, at the Fifth Higher Middle School. He worked there for three years and completed his book "Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan" (1894). In October 1894, he got a job as a journalist with the English-language newspaper "Kobe Chronicle". In 1896, he began teaching English literature at Tokyo Imperial University. He taught there until 1903. In 1904, he became a professor at Waseda University.

On 26 September 1904, he died of heart failure. He was 54 years old. His grave is at the Zōshigaya Cemetery in Toshima, Tokyo.

In the late 19th century, Westerners knew little about Japan. However, the Exposition Universelle of 1900 made Japanese styles fashionable in Western countries. So, Hearn became well-known because of his books about Japan. Later, some critics said Hearn made Japan seem too exotic. But, he gave the West some of its first descriptions of pre-industrial and Meiji Era Japan, so his work has value.

Cation

A cation is an ion with fewer electrons than protons. Therefore, it has a positive charge.

The electric charge on a proton is equal in amount to the charge on an electron. So, the total electric charge on an ion is the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons.


Westwood Memorial Park Cemetery

Westwood Memorial Park Cemetery is a cemetery in the Westwood Village of Los Angeles. It is located at 1218 Glendon Avenue in Westwood.

The cemetery was founded as Sunset Cemetery in 1905, but had been used for burials since the 1880s and was renamed with current name in 1926.

Although it is the resting place of some of the entertainment industry's greatest names, it also contains the graves of many uncelebrated people. For example, when Marilyn Monroe died in 1962, Joe DiMaggio, responsible for Monroe's arrangements, chose Westwood not because of its celebrities but because it was the resting place of Monroe's mother's friend, Grace Goddard, and Goddard's aunt, Ana Lower, both of whom had cared for Monroe as a child.

Procoptodon

Procoptodon is a genus of giant short-faced kangaroo living in Australia during the Pleistocene epoch.

"P. goliah" was the largest kangaroo known to have existed. It stood about tall. They weighed about . Other members of the genus were smaller. "Procoptodon gilli" was the smallest of the genus, only about tall.

They were browsers, not grazers like kangaroos today. They ate leaves from trees and shrubs. Their weight makes it likely that they did not hop as their relatives do today. A combination of climate change (cooling and shrinking of forest areas) would have reduced their natural habitat. Predation (hunting) by aboriginal humans probably happened.

Saltbushes were their main food source, so "Procoptodon goliah" relied on free-standing water to help process its salt-laden diet.

Microatoll

A microatoll is a circular colony of corals, near the surface of the ocean. Because the top is not in the water all the time, the corals at the top are dead. The corals which are not exposed to fresh air are still alive. The atoll will only grow in the areas which are in the water all the time. Microatolls may be up to in diameter. They are named for their resemblance to island atolls formed during the subsidence of volcanic islands, as originally suggested by Darwin (1842).

They have been used to monitor sea levels, in response to global warming. They have also been used to quantify and date changes in sea level in seismically active areas. Using microatolls, scientists were able to provide information about the water temperature at the surface of the sea.

Constantine II of Greece

Constantine II (, "Konstantínos II"; 2 June 1940 – 10 January 2023) reigned as the King of Greece, from 1964 until the end of the monarchy of Greece in 1973. George I of Greece and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh were his relatives.

Constantine was the only son of King Paul and Queen Frederica of Greece. His family was forced to leave the country during the Second World War. For this reason, he spent the first years of his childhood in Egypt and South Africa. 

He returned to Greece with his family in 1946 during the Greek Civil War. King George II died in 1947. Constantine's father Paul became the new king. With this, Constantine became the crown prince.

Constantine became king in 1964 after the death of his father, King Paul. Later that year he married Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark. They had five children. 

At first, the new king was seen as a good sign. There was a lot of political instability during his reign, however. This instability led to the Colonels' Coup of 21 April 1967, when the Greek junta came to power. Constantine was still the head of state. There were no military forces which were loyal to him. For this reason, he was not able to do much. He agreed to inaugurate the junta, if most of the ministers were civilians. There was a coup against the junta, but it failed. 

For this reason, Constantine was forced to leave the country, on 3 December 1967. Formally, he was still the head of state in exile until the junta abolished the monarchy on 1 June 1973. The 1973 Greek republic referendum ratified the abolition. 

There were fears that people had been put under pressure, to vote for a republic. For this reason, some people did not accept the result of the referendum, as valid. A new referendum was held after democracy had been restored in 1974. 

This second referendum was held after the fall of the junta as the 1974 Greek republic referendum on 8 December 1974. The result was the same, though: the monarchy should be abolished, and the Third Hellenic Republic should be started. Constantine was not allowed to return to Greece to campaign. Nevertheless, he accepted the results of the referendum.

Constantine was also a good sailor. He competed at the 1960 Rome Olympics and won a gold medal in the Dragon class. Later he served on the International Olympic Committee. 

Along with his fellow crew members of the "Nireus" sailing vessel, he was named one of the 1960 Greek Athletes of the Year. When he won the medal, in 1960, he was twenty years old. This was the first medal in sailing for Greece, since the 1912 Summer Olympics.

When he aged, his health got worse. On 10 January 2023, he died of a stroke, in Athens.

Dighero became the oldest living person in Europe on 30 August 2005 following the death of Hendrikje van Andel-Schipper of the Netherlands.

At the time of her death, she was the oldest ever documented person from Italy at the age of 114 years, 4 days - a title she held for more than five years, until being surpassed by Venere Pizzinato on 28 November 2010.

George I of Greece

George I (, "Geórgios I"; born Prince William of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg; ; 24 December 1845 – 18 March 1913) also known as Georgios I was King of Greece from 1863 until his assassination in 1913.

George's reign of almost 50 years (the longest in modern Greek history) was characterized by territorial gains as Greece established its place in pre-World War I Europe. He was the grandfather of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and great-grandfather of Charles III.

While out on an afternoon walk near the White Tower on 18 March 1913, he was shot at close range in the back by Alexandros Schinas, who was "said to belong to a Socialist organization" and "declared when arrested that he had killed the King because he refused to give him money". George died instantly, the bullet having penetrated his heart.

Rekawka

Rekawka - a Polish folk festival celebrated on the first Tuesday after Easter Sunday in Krakow, on the Krak Mound (also known as Krakus Mound). It is an ancient tumulus, not far from one of the oldest churches in Krakow – St. Benedict’s church.

Rekawka’s beginnings go back to the ancient Slavic springtime celebrations, called Dziady. For ancient Slavs, spring was a time of burning sacred fires to celebrate the dead, and of planting sacred groves. They also had the custom of leaving food for the dead. The Krak Mound might have been one of such places where they held their celebrations.

These ancient Slavic traditions evolved over time, and customs changed. In the 19th century, it was customary for rich citizens of Krakow to throw coins, apples, sweets and boiled eggs down the grassy slope of the Krak Mound to be picked up by poor local people. Some historians see it as a continuation of the Slavic traditions of leaving food for the dead.

The name of the festival, Rekawka, might go back to the times of a legendary Slavic prince, Krak (or, Krakus). The legend says that Krak was the founder of the city of Kraków, and a great ruler. After his death, the people of Kraków built a high mound in his honour. To build the mound, they were carrying up the earth in their sleeves (Polish "rekaw" – "sleeve") – and, that is why the festival is called Rekawka.

However, the festival’s name might also come from the Old Slavic words "raka", "rakev", meaning "grave" or "burial". While excavating the mound, archaeologists found man-made objects from many different cultures and different periods – from the Stone Age to modern times. And, they also found some burial remains. These finds give evidence to the Old Slavic origin of the mound’s name.

Nowadays, Rekawka has a popular, folk character. If the weather is warm and sunny, it can be an occasion for a pleasant family outing. There are stalls selling sweets and toys, merry-go-rounds, and street musicians. More recently, the festival has been featuring medieval knights fighting each other in mock duels,and medieval craftsmen at work. There is also an opportunity to taste traditional dishes such as kołacze.

Guantanamo Bay detention camp

The Guantanamo Bay detention camp (which is also called Guantanamo or Gitmo) is a United States military prison in Guantanamo Bay Naval Base on the coast of Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. The prison is said to be breaking international human rights laws, as prisoners have been held without trial , and there have been reports of prisoners being tortured.

The prison was established under the presidency of George W. Bush, in 2002 during the War on Terror. The Secretary of Defense at the time was Donald Rumsfeld, who said that the prison was built to hold dangerous people, question them, and charge them with war crimes: "These men are particularly dangerous... at least one detainee now in Cuba has been threatening to kill Americans. Another has bitten a guard... To stop future terrorist attacks, we have detained these people, and we have and will be questioning them to gather additional intelligence information...The reality is that they have been charged with something. They have been found to be engaging on the behalf of Al-Qaeda or the Taliban and have been captured." 
Since January 2002, 779 men have been kept in Guantanamo. These men have been from over 50 countries. Nearly 200 were released in mid 2004. 
Although the Bush govenrnment said that most of the men had been captured at war, a 2006 report found that over 80% of the prisoners were captured by Pakistanis and Afghans for bounty payments. The US had offered $5,000 for each prisoner. 
In 2012, Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson said that US officials (including president Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld) had known that most of the original prisoners were innocent, but kept them to make themselves look better 
A report by the "Institute on Medicine as a Profession" in 2013 said that health professionals in Guantanamo "designed and participated in cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment and torture of detainees." This involved:
Morris Davis (former chief prosecutor for the terrorism trials at Guantanamo Bay), began an e-petition to close Guantanamo. The e-petition got over 72,000 signatures, and called attention to the huger strikes that 'involves more than 100 prisoners, including come 21 who are being force-fed to keep them from starving to death." 
On 12 December 2013, retired US marine Major General Micheal R Lehnert (who oversaw the building of the Guantanamo prison camp) published a piece in the Detroit Free Press. He called Guantanamo "out nation's most notorious prison - a prison that should never have been opened", and provided a short description of its history:
"Our nation created Guantanamo because we were legitimately angry and frightened by an unprovoked attack on our soil on September 11, 2001. We thought that the detainees would provide would provide a treasure trove of information and intelligence.
"I was ordered to construct the first 100 cells at Guantanamo within 96 hours [4 days]. The first group of 20 prisoners arrived 7 days after the order was given. We were told that the prisoners were the 'worst of the worst', a common refrain for every set of detainees sent to Guantanamo. The US has held 779 men there, most of them cleared for transfer, but stuck by politics.
"Even in the earliest days of Guantanamo, I became more and more convinced that many of the detainees should never have been sent in the first place. They had little intelligence value, and there was insufficient evidence linking them to war crime [they didn't know anything, and there was little proof they had committed war crimes]. That the remains the case for many, if not most, of the detainees."
In his 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama described Guantanamo bay as a sad chapter in America's history and promised to close the prison in 2009. He changed this statement after he was elected. President Obama was not able to close Guantanamo before he left office, but he did reduce the prison's population to 41. 
President Trump has promised to keep the prison open, and to use it keep "bad dudes". He also wants to bring back waterboarding and "worse".
On 31st January 2018, Trump signed an order to keep the prison open.

In court filings made public in 2007, FBI agents said that they saw prisoners:
Other claims include:

On 10 June 2006, three prisoners (Mani al-Utaybi, Yasser al-Zahrani, Ali Abdullah Ahmed died in Guantanamo Bay. The Pentagon told the media that the prisoners had been hanged with clothing and bedsheets.
"[The detainees] were found unresponsive and not breathing in their cells by guards.
"Medical teams responded quickly and all three detainees were provided immediate emergency medical treatment in attempts to revive them. The three detainees were pronounced dead by a physician after all life saving measures were exhausted."
- Statement issued by Joint Task Force Guantanamo 
Families of all three detainees doubted the post mortems and wanted second post mortems done. Patrice Malign (the pathologist who re-examined al-Zahrani's body) said that the organs of al-Zahrani's throat were missing. His team could not find if al-Zahrani had hanged himself or died of another form of asphyxiation. The team said that there is no reason for there organs to have been removed. The US government has never given the missing organs back to the family.

On 14th September 2001, Congress pushed for the "Authorisation for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists", which would have given the President broad powers to start The War on Terror in response to the 9/11 attacks. However, Secretary of State Colin Powell and State Department Legal Advisor William Howard Taft IV said that the president must observe the Geneva conventions.
On 13th November 2001, President Bush signed a military order titled "Detention, Treatment and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism".
On 19th February 2002, Guantanamo detainees petitioned to review their detentions and the reasons for them. US District Judge Collen Kollar-Kotelly rejected the petition, finding that non-US citizens in Cuba could not access or use US courts.
On 28th June 2004, the Supreme Court of the United States decided against this in "Rasul v Bush" (UK prisoner in Guantanamo petitioning against Judge Kollar-Kotelly's decision in 2002). Justice John Paul Stevens said that the prisoners had the right to petition the court to review their cases.

The Bush government said that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to the prisoners. Supreme Court decisions since 2004 have said different: it decided in the "Hamden v Rumfeld" trial that Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions (which sets rules for the treatment of prisoners of war) applies to the prisoners
In 2006, Deputy Defense Scretary Paul Wolfowitz created 'Combatant Status Review Tribunals' (CSRTs) to decide if prisoners were war criminals
The CSRTs were completed in March 2005. Thirty-eight of the prisoners were found innocent. After the autobiography of Murnat Kurnaz (Turk-German held in Guantanamo 2002-2007) was published, military lawyer Eugene R. Fidell said that the book "suggested the [CSRT] procedure is a sham; if a case like that can get through then the [smallest trace] of evidence against someone would [win over] for the governments, even if there's a mountain [of evidence] on the other side." 
On 15 July 2005, a panel on the Court of Appeals threw out all of the prisoners' petitions. On 7 November 2005 Supreme Court agreed to review that decision.
On 30 December, Supreme Court passed the 'Detainee Treatment Act' which removed the prisoners' right to petition for review.

The Military Commissions Act 2006 was passed on 17 October 2006, allowing trial in military court for war criminals. On 12 June 2008, the US Supreme Court decided against the government. Justice Antony Kennedy said that Guantanamo prisoners had the right to petition in federal court.
On 3 March 2006, on order of US District Judge Jed S. Rakoff, the Department of Defense released the names of 317 of the 500 prisoners being held in Guantanamo Bay. The remaining 183 were held for privacy reasons.
On 27 September 2007, French Judge put back a conviction of six former Guantanamo prisoners. Defense lawyers for the men (who were all French citizens), accused the French government of working with the US on their detentions.
On 21 October 2008, US District Court Judge Richard J. Leon ordered the release of five Algerians and for a sixth to remain in Guantanamo.
In the summer of 2012, the US government rejected a bid to limit lawyers' access to Guantanamo prisoners. Instead lawyers were required to sign a "Memorandum of Understanding", meaning that they agreed to certain restriction when visiting the prisoners, including losing access to some classified information. This gave the Commander of the Joint Task Force of Guantanamo full control over lawyers' contacct with prisoners, including visits and letters. On 6 September, US District Judge Royce. C Lamberth rejected the argument that prison officers to take charge of meetings between lawyers and prisoners
In April 2004, diplomats called for a investigation of Guantanamo Bay
In May 2007, the United Nations released a report for the UN Human Rights CouncilThe report said that the US had broken international law, Article 5 of the Geneva conventions, and the Nuremberg principles.
In April 2011, a report published in the Public Library of Science Medical Journal looked at nine prisoners for evidence of torture. They found that medical doctors at Guantanamo ignored or hid medical evidence of intentional harm and torture. 
The base containing the prison camp is on territory that is recognized as sovereign Cuban territory. It is legally leased (rented) to the American Navy by the Cuban government through the 'Agreement between the United States and Cuba for the Lease of Lands for Coaling and Naval sites'. This suggests it is illegal for the US to hold a prison on the land.

Abdallah Salih al-Ajmi committed a successful suicide attack in Mosul on 25 March 2008. Al-Ajmi had been released from Guantanamo in 2005 and transferred to where he was from. A Kuwati court later dropped all his terrorism charges.
Moussa Zenmouri (37, Belgian of Moroccan descent) and Soufiane A (Algerian) were arrested on 24 July 2015 on charges of terrorism. They were release from Guantanamo in April 2005 and had been under police for suspected robbery.
Ibrahim al Qosi was featured in a video for 'Guardians of Shariah'as a religious leader in a high position in Al-Qaeda. Al Qosi was Osama bin Laden's accountant in the early 90's, and moved to Afghanistan with bin Laden in 1996. He was also bin Laden's chauffer. He was in Guantanamo from 2002 to 2012.
On 8th March 2016, Reuters reported that 111 of 532 prisoners released by the Bush administration and 7 of 144 released by the Obama administration have returned. So, 118 of 676 (17%) are confirmed to have returned to fighting, and a further 86 (13%) are suspected to have returned to fighting.
In March 2016, Paul Lewis (Pentagon employee tasked with closing Guantanamo) said that "Americans have been killed by prisoners released from Guantanamo Bay", He refused to give a total or say when the attacks occurred.

Human Rights Watch criticised the Bush administration in its 2003 world report, stating "Washington has ignored human rights standards in its own treatment of terrorist suspects. It has refused to apply the Geneva conventions to prisoners of war from Afghanistan, and has misused the designation of 'illegal combatant' to apply to criminal suspects on U.S. soil." 
On 25 May 2005, Amnesty International released its annual report calling the prison the "gulag of our times".
In November 2005, a group of experts from the United Nations on Human Rights called off their visit to Guantanamo Bay Camp Delta, saying that the US was not allowing them to hold private interviews with the prisoners. The group continued to write a report on the conditions in the prison based on interviews with released prisoners, lawyers, and human rights groups that had already visited. In February 2006, that report was published. The report called on the US to either charge or release all suspected terrorists, and included the US ambassador's reply to the draft versions of the report.
On 10 March 2006, a letter in the Lancet (a weekly medical journal) was published, signed by over 250 medical experts, calling for the US to stop force-feeding prisoners and close the prison. Dr David Nicholl (who wrote the letter), said that the definition of torture (that the US was using) as only actions that cause "death or major organ failure" was "not a definition anyone on the planet is using." 
Polls run by the "Program of International Policy" (PIP) found that "large majorities in Germany and Great Britain, and pluralities in Poland and India, believe the US has committed violations of international law at its prison on Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, including the use of interrogations." (This means that large amounts of people in Germany, Great Britain, Poland and India thought that the US was breaking international laws at Guantanamo Bay.) PIP found that a lot of the people who filled the polls said that they no longer saw the US as leaders of human rights because of Guantanamo.

Inupiat language

Inupiaq or Inpuiat language is a group of dialects spoken by the Inuit. It is also called Alaskan Inuit. The name also refers to the people who speak the language. Outside Alaska, it is also spoken on the Diomede Islands. People on Little Diomede speak it; people on Big Diomede spoke it. Big Diomede Island belongs to Russia, and is uninhabited since the end of World War II. The other speakers live in northern and northwestern Alaska, and part of the Northwest Territories. The Inupiat language is closely related to Inuit languages of Canada and Greenland. There are roughly 2,000 speakers in Alaska, and about 24.000 speakers in Canada. It is considered a threatened language with most speakers at or above the age of 40. Iñupiaq is an official language of the State of Alaska.

The name is also rendered as Inupiatun, Iñupiatun, Iñupiaq, Inyupiaq, Inyupiat, Inyupeat, Inyupik, and Inupik.

The main varieties of the Iñupiaq language are Northern Alaskan Iñupiaq and Seward Peninsula Iñupiaq.

There are differences in the three big dialects, both regarding the sounds and the words used. Speakers of two of the three dialects usually understand each other, even though the forms and words used are different. As an example: tupiq means tent in the North Slope dialect, and house in Malimut. The north slope dialect uses iglu to mean house. Sometimes the difference is mostly in spelling: dog is written as qimmiq in North Slope and qipmiq in Malimut. The dialect on the Seward peninsula is quite different, and speakers need some training to understand the two other dialects.

The Iñupiaq language has been in decline since contact with English in the late 19th century. After Alaska became part of the US, many people from other parts moved there. The children of Inuit families were often put in boarding schools far away: There they learnt English, but they lost most of the Inuit languages their parents spoke, and the Inuit culture. This has led to a situation where only a small minority of Inupiat speak the Iñupiaq language. Several communities try to revive the language, though.

Gold Marilyn Monroe (Andy Warhol)

Andy Warhol's Gold Marilyn Monroe is an art piece composed of a photograph of Marilyn Monroe’s face centered on a large (6′ 11″ x 4′ 9″) gold-painted canvas. Warhol used silkscreen ink on synthetic polymer paint on canvas. Completed in 1962, it depicts the celebrity Marilyn Monroe. The image of Monroe is a direct copy of a close-up shot from her film "". This piece was completed the same year as the celebrity's untimely death.

The art currently resides at MoMA.

A sex icon with an innocent aura, Monroe lived a paradoxical life. She was a highly sought-after celebrity, yet she suffered from stage fright and anxiety. Once Monroe was immersed into Hollywood, she was an influential character but she was subject to the lifestyle that accompanies fame. As her popularity increased, her drug habits and anxiety got more and more out of control. This led to her eventual suicide in 1962.

(Andy) Warhol painted a large canvas a shiny gold color. In the center of the canvas and latex, he silk-screened a black and white photograph of Monroe. He painted her face, hair, and blouse. 

The color gold is known to signify wealth, fame, illumination, and wisdom. It draws the eye to the central figure of the painting: Marilyn Monroe. The image of Monroe was not painted by Warhol. In fact, it is a direct copy of a close-up image from the film Niagara. This suggests to the reproductibility of Hollywood actors: Hollywood will always find new actors to replace old ones. Gold Marilyn Monroe includes a reproduction of an iconic image, but it is shown in a new light. She is encompassed by this ocean of gold, the relentless waters of Hollywood. Though Monroe’s face is the main focal point, it is very small in relation to the whole canvas, signifying the effects of grandeur on the human psyche. Monroe’s struggle with fame and drug addiction led to her eventual overdose and suicide in 1962. 

Warhol was entranced by the idea of fame and beauty, leading him to undergo a number of cosmetic surgeries in early adulthood. He dyed his hair metallic-white after college and got nose-reduction surgery in his mid-twenties. He was living in New York City when he created Gold Marilyn Monroe. He was much immersed into the celebrity lifestyle, frequenting Studio 54 and even producing television shows in his later years. It can be inferred that he idolized Marilyn Monroe and related to her struggles with anxiety. Gold Marilyn subtly conveys these struggles Monroe and Warhol both underwent.

The figure in the center of the canvas is empowered, yet oppressed. This dichotomy is synonymous to the life that Monroe led. As her popularity and stardom increased, her drug habits and anxiety got more and more out of control. The shiny-gold background of Gold Marilyn Monroe adds to the twinkling quality of Monroe’s close-up. She appears to shine brighter amidst this already shiny color; this gives the impression that Monroe was her own entity, illuminating those around her. Although she was part of Hollywood, she created her own image and had a unique personality. She turned into a sex icon while still retaining elements of childlike innocence, a feat that many have failed to accomplish. She was known as a feminist, but she died before the feminist movement gained much traction. Monroe’s life was very complex. Although she was a star, she struggled with stage fright. She had drug problems, but she was mostly successful in keeping it out of the public sphere. The Hollywood lifestyle was a catalyst for her eventual suicide.

Libido

Libido is a person's 'sex drive'. A person's overall sexual drive (desire for sexual activity) varies greatly. Someone with a libido is called an "allosexual". Someone without it is called "asexual".

Sex drive is influenced by biological, psychological and social factors. Sex hormones like
testosterone, and neurotransmitters like dopamine affect the libido. Both of these work on a brain nucleus called the "nucleus accumbens" (one in each half of the brain). These centres work on motivation, learning, and reinforcement.

Social factors, such as work and family, and internal psychological factors, such as personality and stress, can affect libido. Sex drive can also be affected by medical conditions, medication, lifestyle and relationship issues, and age (e.g. puberty).

The Mamluk dynasty ruled much of Eastern Pakistan, Northern India and present-day Bangladesh from 1206 to 1290. It was the first of five dynasties of the Delhi Sultanate, which lasted until 1526.

The Mamluk, literally meaning "owned", was a soldier of slave origin (came from a slave background) who had converted to Islam. In the 9th century the Mamluks became a powerful military caste in Muslim societies. Mamluks held political and military power most notably in Egypt, but also in Levant, Iraq, and the Indo-Pak subcontinent.

In 1206, Muhammad of Ghor, Sultan of the Ghurid dynasty was assassinated. Since he had no children, his empire split into minor sultanates led by his former mamluk generals. 

Taj-ud-Din Yildoz became the ruler of Ghazni. Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji got Bengal. Nasir-ud-Din Qabacha became the sultan of Multan. Qutb ud-Din Aibak became the sultan of Delhi, and that was the beginning of the Slave dynasty. However, his reign as the Sultan of Delhi was short lived as he died in 1210. His son Aram Shah came to the throne, only to be assassinated by Iltutmish in 1211.

The Sultanate under Iltutmish established friendly contacts with the Abbasid Caliphate between 1228–29. He had managed to keep India unaffected by the invasions of Genghis Khan and his successors.Following the death of Iltutmish in 1236, a series of weak rulers remained in power. The throne shifted from Rukn ud din Firuz to Razia Sultana until Ghiyas ud din Balban, the last powerful ruler of this dynasty. The Khalji dynasty was established, when Jalal ud din Firuz Khalji overthrew the last of the Slave dynasty rulers, Muiz ud din Qaiqabad, the great grandson of Balban.

Leaf miner

A leaf miner is the larva of an insect which lives inside a leaf and eats it. Most leaf-mining insects are moths (Lepidoptera), sawflies (Symphyta, a type of wasp) and flies (Diptera). Some beetles also do this.

Like woodboring beetles, leaf miners are protected from many predators and plant defences by feeding inside a leaf, eating its tissues. It eats only the layers that have the least cellulose. Also, when attacking "Quercus robur" (English oak), they feed on tissues with lower levels of tannin. Tannin is a chemical produced in abundance by the tree. It is not edible.

The pattern of the feeding tunnel and the layer of the leaf being mined shows what insect is responsible, sometimes even to the exact species. The mine often contains frass, or droppings, and the pattern of frass deposition, mine shape, and host plant identity show the species and instar of the leaf miner. A few mining insects feed in other parts of a plant, such as the surface of a fruit.

It has been suggested that some patterns of leaf variegation may be part of a defensive strategy used by plants. It deceives adult leaf miners into thinking that a leaf has already been preyed upon.

Gul Circle MRT station

Gul Circle MRT station is (EW30) is an above ground MRT station on the East West Line.

The station is the only above-ground station on the MRT network where the eastbound and westbound platforms are not located on the same level. This special layout is a provision for a possible two-station future extension to Tuas South, which would likely branch out from this station in a fashion similar to Tanah Merah MRT station as of 2024. Official details for this extension have not yet been announced.

The idea of the extension was first mooted on 25 January 2008 with the extension proposed to be completed by 2015.
The stations were first announced on 11 January 2011 by Transport Minister Mr Raymond Lim in a speech while visiting Bedok when new platform screen doors opened there and originally fixed 2016 as the original year of the line completion.

The station is expected to benefit an estimated 100,000 commuters daily. It is the first elevated stacked island platform, as there is a possible future two-station extension to Tuas South leading out from this station or interchange with another line. The $190-million contract was awarded to Shanghai Tunnel Engineering, a major civil engineering company from China for this station.

This station ceiling is above ground - about the height of a 10-storey HDB (Housing Development Board) block, the highest elevated station along the MRT network. There are two reasons for the height. First, the 7.5 km, $3.5 billion extension goes over the Ayer Rajah Expressway viaduct at the Pan-Island Expressway interchange. Second, a 4.8 km portion of the line is being integrated with a road viaduct, which runs below the rail line.

The opening of the station was delayed from 2016 to the second quarter of 2017 to make way for the installation of the new signalling system. It became fully operational on 18 June 2017.

Train services between Gul Circle and Tuas Link were temporary closed between 16 and 19 November 2017 following a collision that happened at Joo Koon. On 20 November 2017, train services from Gul Circle to Tuas Link were resumed; however, train services between Joo Koon and Gul Circle will be suspended till mid-2018 to facilitate maintenance work on signalling devices.

The station was built with two extra tracks opposite the operational EWL tracks, possibly for cross platform interchange with a future two-station extension of the line to Tuas South.

Al-Nusra Front

Al-Nusra Front or Jabhat al-Nusra (), known as Jabhat Fatah al-Sham () is one of the organizations fighting in the Syrian Civil War. Since July 2016, it has also been known as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (, transliteration: "Jabhat Fataḥ al-Šām"). It has also been called al-Qaeda in Syria or al-Qaeda in the Levant. They are a Salafist organization and want to create an Islamic state in the country.

The group announced its formation on 23 January 2012. The United States designated Jabhat al-Nusra as a foreign terrorist organization, followed by the United Nations Security Council and many other countries. It was the official Syrian branch of al-Qaeda until July 2016, when it became a separate organization. In early 2015, the group became one of the major components of the powerful jihadist joint operations room named the Army of Conquest, which took over large territories in Northwestern Syria. It also operates in neighbouring Lebanon. In November 2012, "The Washington Post" described al-Nusra as the most successful arm of the rebel forces.

In July 2016, al-Nusra formally separated from al-Qaeda and re-branded as Jabhat Fateh al-Sham ("Front for the Conquest of the Levant").

On 28 January 2017, following violent clashes with Ahrar al-Sham and other rebel groups, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham merged with four other groups to become Tahrir al-Sham.

According to spokesmen of a moderate wing of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), in November 2012 Nusra had between 6,000 and 10,000 fighters, which was 7–9% of the FSA's total fighters. Commentator David Ignatius for "The Washington Post" described Nusra then as the most aggressive and successful arm of the FSA. The United States Department of State stated likewise: "From the reports we get from the doctors, most of the injured and dead FSA are Jabhat al-Nusra, due to their courage and [the fact they are] always at the front line". On 10 December 2012, the U.S. designated Nusra a foreign terrorist organization and an alias of Al Qaeda in Iraq. That decision made it illegal for Americans to deal financially with Nusra. Days earlier, the American ambassador to Syria, R. Ford, had said: "Extremist groups like Jabhat al-Nusra are a problem, an obstacle to finding the political solution that Syria's going to need".

Condorraptor

Condorraptor (meaning 'robber from Cerro Condor') is a genus of Megalosaurid theropod dinosaur. From the Middle Jurassic of Argentina, it was one of the earliest large South American theropods. The animal was about 4.5 metres long and it weighed about 200 kg. It is very similar to another theropod from the same formation called "Piatnitzkysaurus".

Marshosaurus

Marshosaurus is a genus of medium-sized carnivorous theropod dinosaur. It was from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of Utah and perhaps Colorado. This carnivore operated in the same territory as the larger and more famous "Allosaurus". It was about 4.5 metres long and weighed 200 kg.

The Morrison Formation is a sequence of shallow sea and river delta sediments between 156.3 million years ago at its base, to 146.8 mya at the top. That puts it in the later Jurassic period. The area would have been rather dry, with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin where dinosaurs lived, stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan. It was formed when the early Rocky Mountains started pushing up in the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels and floodplains. This formation is similar in age to the Solnhofen Limestone Formation in Germany and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania.

Because of its wide use in the early 20th century, "Palaeoscincus" is often shown with the armor of "Edmontonia" and the tail club of an ankylosaurid.

Thespesius

Thespesius, or Thespecius, is an extinct hadrosaur described by Joseph Leidy in 1876.

"Thespecius" was discovered in Montana in 1855. Known fossils include vertebrae and toe bones (phalanx). 

The name "Thespesius" means wondrous one. Leidy avoided using the suffix "saurus" in the genus name because Vandiveer Hayden had claimed the bones came from a layer from the Miocene so there was a chance that the animal would turn out to be a mammal, though Leidy himself was convinced it was a dinosaurian. "Thespesius" turned out to be a dinosaur. The specific name "occidentalis" means "western" in Latin.

Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry

The Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry is well known for having the densest concentration of Jurassic dinosaur fossils ever found. It is a paleontological site near Cleveland, Utah. The quarry is in a part of the geological layers known as the Morrison Formation.

Well over 15,000 bones have been excavated from this Jurassic excavation site. There are many thousands more awaiting excavation and study. It was designated a National Natural Landmark in October 1965.

All of these bones, belonging to different species, are found disarticulated and mixed together. Perhaps this strong concentration of mixed fossilised bones is due to a "predator trap". No scientific consensus has been reached yet and debates continue to the present day.

Anglo-Zanzibar War

The Anglo-Zanzibar War was fought between the Sultanate of Zanzibar, a state in and capital of the country of Zanzibar, and the United Kingdom on 27 August 1896. Lasting between 38 to 45 minutes, it is the shortest recorded war in history.

The current Sultan (the person who rules the Sultanate of Zanzibar), Sultan Hamad bin Thwaini, who was pro-British, died. While he was alive, because he was English Council approved, he and the Sultanate of Zanzibar were on good terms with England, but when he died, a new Sultan was needed. 

Sultan Khalid bin Barghash, his 29-year-old nephew eventually became his successor, but Khalid was no-longer approved by England, now making him and his state enemies with the English Army. England told him to come out of hiding, but the new Sultan's response was to barricade himself in his palace even more. As expected, the Sultanate of Zanzibar was absolutely destroyed by the English Army, which led to what we know today as the Anglo-Zanzibar war, the shortest recorded war in history that lasted between 38 to 45 minutes.

There were varying casualties on both sides. For England, only a single sailor was wounded, but for the Sultanate of Zanzibar five hundred were killed or injured (including civilians), 4 artillery pieces were destroyed, a shore battery was destroyed, two other boats were sunk, and the HHS Glasgow (the Sultan’s personal royal ship) was sunk. The Sultan’s palace was also burned down to the ground.

Khalid was captured by English forces in 1916, and a new Sultan, Sultan Hamoud, became his successor. This new leader was extraordinarily loyal to England and their council, which definitely helped Zanzibar recover from this attack, as England decided not to impose new harsh rules on their relationship with the sultanate.

Guhyasamāja Tantra

Guhyasamāja Tantra (Sanskrit: Guhyasamājatantra; Tibetan: Gsang ’dus rtsa rgyud; English: "Tantra of the Secret Community") is a tantra method of Tibetan Buddhism. The central figure is called "Vajra‐pāni" which means a vajra-carrier or a vajra-master.

The Guhyasamāja Tantra was the secret gathering based on thought that having sexual relations with many women would contribute to Buddhism awakening. The legitimate wives of the vajra‐sattvaḥa, called "dakinis", were limited only to virgins. Although the number of dakinis is variously drafted according to the literature, it probably amounts to a number of geometrical progressionwise.

Also statues and pictures were made to beautify the method. However, because those acts had no integrity to fundamental buddhist precepts, it is no longer done in Tibetan Buddhism. On the contrary, warning symbols and festivals, such as Citipati, are widely spread.

Shearography is a method used to test if something is broken on the inside, where people cannot see. Things that can be tested with shearography are airplane wings, wind turbine generator blades, boats, and other structures. A special camera is used to take a picture of something that might be broken inside. After this picture is taken, the structure is pushed a little bit so that it bends slightly. While it is bent, another photo is taken with the special camera in the same location. The special camera uses computer software to compare the two pictures. If the software sees any damage, it will display the damage on a computer monitor so people can see it.

Coherence (physics)

Coherence in advanced physics is a phenomenon of electromagnetic waves.

In physics, two wave sources are perfectly coherent if they have a constant phase difference and the same frequency, and the same waveform. In such a case the waves plot as identical: their peaks and troughs occur at the same time, and they have the same amplitude.

Coherence is an ideal property of waves. It produces stationary (i.e. temporally and spatially constant) interference.

The idea has several distinct concepts. These are limiting cases which never quite occur in reality. However, they allow an understanding of the physics of waves, and have become an important concept in quantum physics.

More generally, coherence describes all properties of the correlation between physical quantities of a single wave, or between several waves or wave packets.

Battle of Fulford

The Battle of Fulford took place on the 20th September 1066 near York. The battle was between Viking invaders and English Earls. It was fought by, on one side, King Harald III of Norway (Harald Hardrada (Old Norse, meaning "hard ruler") and his English ally Tostig Godwinson. On the other side were two Earls, Edwin and Morcar. Tostig was the exiled brother of the English king Harold Godwinson. The battle was fought out on the outskirts of the village of Fulford, close to York.

The battle was a decisive victory for the Viking army. The earls of York could have hidden behind the walls of their city. Instead, they met the Viking army across a river. All day the English tried to break the Viking shield wall but failed.

Edwin and Morcar had survived the battle. York surrendered to the Norwegians. Harald had won the battle. One cause of the battle was that Earl Morcar had replaced Tostig as Earl of Northumbria.

The Anglo-Saxon king Edward the Confessor died on 5 January 1066 without an heir. The only surviving member of the royal family was Edgar, the young son of Edward Ætheling. On the day of King Edward's funeral, 6 January, Harold Godwinson, the Earl of Wessex, rushed to London, where he was crowned king in the Abbey of Saint Peter of Westminster, by Ealdred, Archbishop of York. Harold Godwinson was elected as King by the Witenagemot, who had gathered in Westminster to celebrate the feast of Epiphany.

However, two powerful earls, brothers Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria, challenged his authority. Sources indicate that Harold moved north to confront them; however, in the end he got their loyalty by marrying their sister, Edith, the widow of Griffith of Wales. By securing the loyalty of Edwin and Morcar, Godwinson increased his strength in the north. These men were, in fact, the first barrier between Harald Hardrada and Harold Godwinson.

The defeat of the earls had a big consequence. Because his enemies won, King Harold Godwinson had to force-march his troops , from London to York. He did this within a week of Fulford. He surprised the Viking army and defeated them at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. In the meantime William, Duke of Normandy, had landed his army in Sussex on the south coast.

Probably the engagements at Fulford Gate and at the Battle of Stamford Bridge seriously affected Harold's strength at the Battle of Hastings some three weeks later. There is no doubt that if Harold had not been diverted by the battles in the north, he would have been better prepared to fight William at Hastings and the result might have been different.

Voldemort and his followers, believing Harry is dead, present Harry's body to all the students of Hogwarts. However, Neville Longbottom, one of Harry's friends, steps forward and kills Nagini with the Sword of Gryffindor, destroying Voldemort's final Horcrux. Harry reveals that he is alive and many of Voldemort's followers run away, including the Malfoy family. Voldemort's remaining followers attack the school students, staff and parents. Ron's mother, Molly, manages to kill Bellatrix.

Voldemort tries to use the Elder Wand to kill Harry. However, Harry explains that the wand never belonged to Snape because it was Draco who took it from Dumbledore. Harry then reveals that when he defeated Draco in a fight a few days prior, meaning that Harry is the master of the Elder Wand. Voldemort does not believe him and attempts to kill Harry.

Sovereign (British coin)

The sovereign is a gold coin of the United Kingdom, with a nominal value of one pound sterling. 

It has been struck from 1817 until the present day. it was originally a circulating coin accepted in Britain and elsewhere in the world. Now it is a bullion coin and is sometimes mounted in jewellery. 

A bullion coin is a coin struck from precious metal and kept as a store of value or an investment, rather than used in day-to-day commerce. The United Kingdom defines investment coins as "coins that have been minted after 1800, have a purity of not less than 900 thousandths and are, or have been, legal tender in their country of origin".

In most recent years, it has the well-known design of Saint George and the Dragon on the reverse—the initials () of the designer, Benedetto Pistrucci, is to the right of the date.

The British government promoted the use of the sovereign as an aid to international trade. The Royal Mint took lightweight gold coins out of circulation. From the 1850s until 1932, the sovereign was also struck at colonial mints, initially in Australia, and later in Canada, South Africa and India. They have been struck again in India since 2013 for the local market. The sovereigns issued in Australia initially carried a unique local design, but by 1887, all new sovereigns bore Pistrucci's George and Dragon design. Strikings there were so large that by 1900, about 40 per cent of the sovereigns in Britain had been minted in Australia.

With the start of the First World War in 1914, the sovereign vanished from circulation in Britain, replaced by paper money, and it did not return after the war, though issues at colonial mints continued until 1932. The coin was still used in the Middle East, and demand rose in the 1950s, which the Royal Mint eventually responded to by striking new sovereigns in 1957. It has been struck since then both as a bullion coin and, beginning in 1979, for collectors. Though the sovereign is no longer in circulation, it is still legal tender in the United Kingdom.

Fannie Lou Hamer

Hamer protested for racial equality and reproductive rights in America. She is known for speaking for the African American group at an important national all-white meeting. Hamer was also a church singer. Her perseverance and rebellious spirit allowed her to help others, and make a long-lasting impact. 

Hamer spent a large portion of her life working in the fields. She grew up on a farm. She married her husband in 1944, and they found work at a nearby plantation. 

In 1962, Hamer learned that voting registration for Black Americans was possible. She immediately traveled to the nearest poll. However, she could not pass the literacy test. It was made very difficult to keep Black Americans from being able to vote. She soon returned home. She was fired from her job because she wanted to vote. She continued to attempt registration. She was arrested. In prison, she was beaten. However, her confidence and perseverance gained nationwide attention. 

In 1964, she co-founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP). This organization challenged the local Democratic Party’s racist efforts. In 1968, Hamer became an official member of Mississippi’s first delegation to have both White and Black Americans. She organized many more operations and rallies in support of civil rights. Hamer traveled around the country, giving powerful speeches. In 1971, Hamer helped to found the National Women’s Political Caucus.

She later founded the Freedom Farm Cooperative (FFC). Hamer purchased land that Black people could own and farm independently. Donors supported her so that she could buy more than 600 acres to build a store, a boutique, and a sewing factory.
Hamer grew up in Mississippi, USA. She was the youngest of twenty children. Their family was able to get a small amount of a land and a tractor. A white family was very upset that Hamer’s family had this. The white family killed their cattle. After this event, The Hamer family was even poorer than before. Later Hamer said in an interview, “Things got so tough I began to wish I was white.” She also said that her mother got angry at her for saying that and her mother said “Don't ever, ever say that. You respect yourself as a little black child. And as you grow older, respect yourself as a black woman. Then one day, other people will respect you.”Hamer told herself that she would “Do something for the black man of the South if it would cost her life.”Later in Hamer’s life, she married Perry “Pap” Hamer. She adopted 4 children since she could not have any of her own.

When Hamer was still working, she learned that voting registration for Black Americans was possible. However, she could not pass the purposely-difficult literacy exam, and returned home. She was fired immediately upon return, and had much of her property confiscated. 

Hamer was angry and hoped to change the separated system. This hope led her to become a politician. During her political life, she was most well known for her work in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. While doing this job, Hamer fought for equality in voting. Hamer received the attention of the country for her position in the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. This helped black people to be elected to national offices in Mississippi. Henry Kirksey, a black representative in national offices, said "If Fannie Lou Hamer had had the same opportunities that Martin Luther King had, then we would have had a female Martin Luther King."

Laban movement analysis

Laban movement analysis (LMA) describes human movement. It is based on the original work of Rudolf Laban, and many others helped to develop it. Its main and original purpose was to be a dance notation. Before film and video were developed, there was no way to record dance moves so that later dancers could use those moves. The transmission of dance from one generation to the next depended on older expert dancers teaching young dancers.

The problem was especially notable in modern dance, where the vocabulary of classical dance figures was expanded with almost no limits. Towards the end of his life, Laban extended his ideas into the movements workers made during physical work.

LMA draws from many fields including anatomy, kinesiology and psychology. It is used by dancers, actors, gymnasts and many other groups. However, it is fair to say that it is now largely replaced by video recordings. Also, it is not the only kind of dance notation, and not the only way human movement can be written down as a record for later generations. And, it was not the first such system. For example, in the 1680s Pierre Beauchamp had a dance notation system for baroque dance, and in 1887/8 Eadweard Muybridge started to use film to record human and animal movement. It is film and video which has transformed our understanding of motion, rather than dance notation. But in its field the Laban notation was notable.

Dance which has been reliably recorded on notation and perhaps backed up by video recording, can be and has been used to copyright choreography.

Point Pelee National Park

Point Pelee National Park (), also known as just Point Pelee, is a national park in Essex County. Essex County is in Ontario, Canada. Point Pelee is a peninsula of land and has many marshes and forest habitats. The shape of the park is a triangle with a sharp point in Lake Erie. Middle Island in Lake Erie is also part of the national park.

The national park is at the southernmost part of mainland Canada. The area is around by wide in the north part of the park. The park was created in 1918. It was the first national park of Canada that was created to protect the area. All of the other national parks of Canada were created at first for tourism. It became a Ramsar site on 27 May 1987. The park also became a dark-sky preserve in 2006.

The First Nations of Canada lived on Point Pelee for a long time. This was before the Europeans came to colonize the area. People think people used to live on the biggest archaeological site that was found at Point Pelee between AD 700 and 900. Point Pelee was named by two priests in 1670. They were Fathers Dollier and Galinee. The word "pelée" is the French word for bald.

Naturalists and hunters wanted to protect the area. They thought that the biodiversity of virds needed protection from land development in the area. Before the park was created, a group called the Great Lakes Ornithological Society was created. They studied the bird migration in the area. In 1915, they recommended that Point Pelee become a national park. It was the first national park that was created to protect the area. That changed how national parks were created. When the park was created, there were still many cottages in the area and two hotels. There were also many farms and a school.

Many cottages were still being built after the national park was created. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, no more land in the park was sold. The park had a development plan in the 1920s. A highway was supposed to be built in the park. Beginning in the 1960s, a lot of people went to the park. Point Pelee became the national park that the most people went to. Almost 781 000 people went to Point Pelee in 1963. Because many people visited the park, a lot of the nature and wildlife was destroyed. The government of Canada said that Point Pelee should not be a national park anymore because of this.

After the 1980s, the government of Canada began protecting the area more. They stopped allowing cars to drive to the tip. Instead, they began a shuttle to the tip. They began buying all the cottages in the park and removing them. They removed more than 350 buildings. They have also removed two roads. In 1989, duck hunting wasn't allowed in the park anymore. In 1991, the government began killing some of the deer in the park to protect the plants. They have killed some of the deer a few more times after that.

Point Pelee became a dark-sky preserve in 2006. It was the first national park of Canada to become a dark-sky preserve. In 2006, waves from Lake Erie washed away the tip. After this, in 2007, the tip reappeared. This was because Lake Erie's water level went down. The tip changes each year, growing longer or shorter. In 2017, a fire in Point Pelee burned down some of the marsh land. Around 125 hectares were burned down.

The park is in the St. Lawrence Lowlands. It is Canada's second smallest national park, after the Georgian Bay Islands National Park. This is because it is only . A very large area of the park is marshland and has ponds. This is 70% of the park. The rest of the park is mostly forest. Forests are 21% of the park. The sandspit around the park mostly has till plains. These till plains were created in the last Ice Age.

Point Pelee has a humid continental climate. It has warm and humid summers and cold winters. The temperatures of the park are changed by Lake Erie.

Tuas Link MRT station

Tuas Link MRT station (EW33) is an above-ground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station along the East West Line in Tuas, Singapore. It is the western terminus of the East West Line, and the westernmost MRT station in the network.

It is the first above-ground station to have platforms on a lower level than the station control room, fare gates and ticketing machines.

Tuas Link station is within walking distance to Raffles Marina, Tuas Checkpoint and the Malaysia–Singapore Second Link. However, as Tuas Checkpoint is designated as a vehicular checkpoint, travellers are not allowed to enter the checkpoint on foot via Tuas Link station.

Tuas Link MRT station, along with the rest of the Tuas West Extension of the East West MRT Line, was first announced on 11 January 2011 by Transport Minister Raymond Lim. The groundbreaking ceremony marking the start of the construction of Tuas West Extension was held at this station on 4 May 2012 by Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew. When opened, the extension is expected to serve more than 100,000 commuters daily.

The opening of the station was delayed from 2016 to the second quarter of 2017 to make way for the installation of the new signalling system. The station and the Tuas West Extension started operations on 18 June 2017.

Stations between Gul Circle to Tuas Link were temporary closed between 16 and 19 November 2017 following a collision between two trains at Joo Koon station. On 20 November 2017, train service from Gul Circle to Tuas Link was resumed; however, train services between Joo Koon and Gul Circle will be suspended till mid-2018 to facilitate maintenance work on signalling devices.

Alstom Metropolis C830C

The Alstom Metropolis C830C, together with the Alstom Metropolis C751C are the second generation of communications-based train control (CBTC) rolling stock to be used in Singapore’s Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) lines. 24 trainsets of 3 cars were manufactured by Shanghai Alstom Transport Co Ltd (a joint venture between Alstom and Shanghai Electric), with deliveries from end June 2014.

The tender for trains under the contract 830C was opened together with another contract C751C for an additional 18 North East Line trains which closed on 18 July 2011 with 5 bids. The Land Transport Authority has shortlisted all of them and the tender results was published on 1 February 2012.

The outside of the train is almost the same as the older C830, with slight differences such as a larger SMRT logo and the look of the train inside. The reserved seats are coloured red to make them more obvious. Navy blue and yellow coloured seats are installed in the driving motor cars (end carriages) while the seats in the middle car are khaki. The train's system that allows it to move is louder than the C830's, and is identical the one found on the Amsterdam Metro M5 Series.

Other changes include the inner layer of the doors finished in bluish-grey, a new Visual Passenger Information System, similar to the C951, located above the doors and a new gangway design similar to the C751C.

The C830C runs without a driver, using Communications-based train control (CBTC), which does not require "fixed-block track circuits" to find where the train is on the track. Instead, they use "continuous two-way digital communication" between each controlled train and a control center, which may control an area of a railroad line, a complete line, or a group of lines. It has been found that CBTC systems reduce costs for running the system and allow the system to be controlled more easily.

The configuration of a C830C in revenue service is Mc1-T-Mc2

The car numbers of the trains range from 841x to 864x, where x depends on the carriage type. Individual cars are assigned a 4 digit serial number. A complete three-car trainset consists of one trailer(T) and two driving motor cars(Mc1 & Mc2) permanently coupled together. For example, set 864 consists of carriages 8641, 8642, 8643.

Clementi rail accident

The 1993 Clementi rail accident was a rail accident that occurred on the East West line of the Singapore MRT. It was the MRT's first major incident and resulted in 156 passengers being injured. It was caused by a oil spill.

The MRT commenced operations in 1987, with the part of the line from Outram Park MRT station to Jurong East MRT station opening on 12 March 1988. At the time of the accident, the system had been operating for six years.

Before the start of service, a maintenance vehicle leaked oil onto the tracks from Buona Vista MRT station to Clementi MRT station until the junction with Ulu Pandan Depot. The first 10 westbound trains reported braking difficulties. The eleventh train, a C151, had to use its emergency brakes to stop at the station. At 7.50 am on 5 August 1993, the 12th train, another C151, collided with the stationary C151 at Clementi while it was recharging its batteries, resulting in 156 injuries.

the investigation showed that the cause of the accident was a oil spill caused by a defective rubber ring on a maintenance locomotive.

In the aftermath of the accident, SMRT said that it would replace the faulty maintenance locomotives and purchase new ones. It also introduced a new policy for station managers to inspect tracks for oil or foreign objects before the start of service.

The second collision on the MRT, the Joo Koon rail accident, occurred 24 years later on 15 November 2017, when two C151A trains collided at Joo Koon MRT station.

After completing his Ph.D under Linus Pauling at the California Institute of Technology, Meselson became a Professor at Harvard University in 1960. He is there today as today as Thomas Dudley Cabot Professor of the Natural Sciences.

In the famous Meselson–Stahl experiment of 1958 he and Frank Stahl showed with nitrogen isotope labeling that DNA is replicated semi-conservatively. In addition, Meselson, François Jacob, and Sydney Brenner discovered the existence of messenger RNA in 1961. Meselson has investigated DNA repair in cells and how cells recognize and destroy foreign DNA, and, with Werner Arber, was responsible for the discovery of restriction enzymes.

Since 1963 he has been interested in chemical warfare and biological defense and arms control.

Wolf Children

Wolf Children () is an Japanese anime movie directed/co-written by Mamoru Hosoda.

Hana, a college student, has two children with a werewolf. She names the girl Yuki and the boy Ame. Not long after this, their father dies. Hana decides to keep raising the children.

As the children grow older, Hana finds it is hard to hide the werewolf powers inherited from their father: ultimately, she moves them to the countryside to avoid trouble from the public. She works hard to repair a house and grow their own food.

Ame becomes confident in himself after a near-death experience, and the children are allowed to attend school. Yuki adapts and makes friends, while Ame drops out to receive lessons from an old fox named Sensei about surviving in the wild. At this time, they are beginning to form their life paths.

In fourth grade, a transfer student named Souhei begins attending Yuki's class. He realizes she is not normal, and during a chase, Yuki accidentally injures his ear. He tells his mother a wolf attacked him, not Yuki. Over time, they become friends.

Ame and Yuki later fight each other over their "real" selves: neither sibling can agree whether or not they are wolf or human. Hana recognizes they are forming their futures, but is worried about it. Ame reveals that Sensei has been gravely wounded during a storm and will likely not survive, but then hints that he will succeed Sensei as the guardian of the wild. Hana is horrified by this, and begs him not to return to the forest.

Two years later, despite what Hana told him, Ame disappears into the forest during a severe storm to replace Sensei; Hana goes after him. She forgets to pick up Yuki from school, who is left alone with Souhei while the other students are retrieved. She decides to reveal herself as a wolf to him. He replies that he already knew and will keep her secret.

Hana gets hurt by a fall and dreams about her lover, who tells her that Ame will be fine with his chosen path. Ame picks her up and gets her to safety, but then turns into an adult wolf and runs off into the mountains. Hana is initially heartbroken as she believes she has not yet done anything for Ame, but soon recognizes he is now "where he belongs" and bids him farewell.

The next school year, Yuki leaves home to move into a dorm room with her friends in Junior High. Ame's howls are heard throughout the forest. Despite living alone in the house, Hana feels that she has raised her children well.

Tormentor (Slayer song)

With classic tunes of thrash metal and riffs derived from the punk trend, "Tormentor" is a 1983 single recognized as one of the most emblematic songs of the American band Slayer from their album "Show No Mercy". 

Several songs and bands have the name "Tormentor" in their names or titles. However, Slayer's "Tormentor" is one of the best known in which the word is used. The band Kreator also has a song called "Tormentor", created two years after Slayer's song.

As with other songs of the band, "Tormentor" has a dark and lugubrious tone reminiscent of the album "Killers", by Iron Maiden, where a story is told, sometimes in the first person, with a supernatural theme, Noir story, or Satanism.

The narrative is from the point of view of a murderer in search of anyone walking in the solitude of the night in order to turn them into his next victim. The killer does not want to kill too soon as he starts playing with them. The murderer likes to see how fear upsets the victim who sees the potential murderer in every shadow. They realize that their mind is playing tricks on them. This is what the murderer wants, as it will torment them (hence the name of "Tormentor", "he who torments") until, in the end, he strikes.

Ice planet

An ice planet is a theoretical type of exoplanet where everything is frozen. None has been found so far, but astronomers think they do exist.

They might have an icy surface of substances which are volatile on Earth, such as water, ammonia, and methane. Ice planets consist of a global cryosphere. They are bigger versions of the small icy worlds of the Solar System, like the moons Europa, Enceladus, and Triton, the dwarf planets Pluto and Eris.

Some ice worlds might have subsurface oceans, warmed by internal heat or tidal forces from another nearby body. Liquid subsurface water might provide habitable conditions for life. Microorganisms can produce nutrients using specific chemicals (chemosynthesis) that may provide food and energy for other organisms. Some planets, if conditions are right, may have strong atmospheres and surface liquids like Saturn's moon Titan, which could be habitable for exotic forms of life.


Rice flour

Rice flour is made from either white rice or brown rice. To make the flour, the husk of rice or paddy is removed. The raw rice is then ground to flour. 

Rice flour is a particularly good substitute for wheat flour, which some people believe irritates their digestive system. Rice flour is also used as a thickening agent in recipes that are refrigerated or frozen.

Many dishes are made from rice flour, including rice noodles and desserts like Japanese mochi and Filipino cascaron. Vietnamese banh canh uses rice flour and it is also used in making General Tso's chicken. In Chinese, it is called "mifen" (Chinese: 米粉; pinyin: mǐ fěn) Also it can be used in cooking, steamed, fried (fried rice noodlesChinese: 炒米粉; pinyin: chǎo mǐ fěn). Also it is used in other cuisine, such as galapong in Ilokano/Filipino, and pirinç unu in Turkish cuisine. It can also be used to make rice bread.

Brown rice flour can be combined with vermiculite for the cultivation of mushrooms. Hard cakes of colonised substrate can then be fruited in a humid container. This method is often (though not always) employed by growers of edible mushrooms. It is a very simple and low-cost method of growing mushrooms.


Ice giant

An ice giant is a huge planet made mostly of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, such as oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. There are two known ice giants in the Solar System, Uranus and Neptune.

In astrophysics and planetary science the term "ice" refers to volatile chemical compounds with freezing points above about , such as water, ammonia, or methane, with freezing points of , respectively.

In the 1990s, it was realized that Uranus and Neptune are a distinct class of giant planet, different from the other giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn. They have become known as "ice giants". They were solids when the planets were stuck together during their formation. Today, little of the water in Uranus and Neptune is in the form of ice. Instead, the water is a at the temperatures and pressures inside them.

Ice giants consist of only about 20% hydrogen and helium in mass, as opposed to the Solar System's gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, which are both more than 90% hydrogen and helium in mass.

The Yachts

Yachts were a British new wave band, best remembered for their 1978 single, "Yachting Type", and minor new wave classic, "Matanovi's Hits".

Chicago &quot;L&quot;

The Chicago "L" (short for "elevated railway") is the Chicago rapid transit system. It serves the city of Chicago and some of its surrounding suburbs in the U.S. state of Illinois. 

The "L" is operated by the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA). It is the fourth-largest rapid transit system in the United States. It is long, and the second-busiest rail mass transit system in the United States, after the New York City Subway.

Chicago's "L" has 24-hour service on some portions of its network. It is one of only five rapid transit systems in the United States to do so. The oldest sections of the Chicago "L" started operations in 1892, making it the second-oldest rapid transit system in the Americas, after New York City's elevated lines.


Chaz Jankel

Charles Jeremy Jankel (born 16 April 1952), better known as Chaz Jankel, is an English musician with a career spanning more than 40 years. He came to prominence in the late 1970s as the guitarist and keyboardist of the rock band Ian Dury and the Blockheads. With Dury, Jankel co-wrote some of the band's best-known songs including "Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll", "Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick" and "Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3".

In addition to his work with the Blockheads, Jankel has had a solo career which has resulted in nine studio albums. He has a long list of credits as both a performer and as songwriter.

English Chess Federation

The English Chess Federation (ECF) is the governing chess organisation in England and is affiliated to FIDE. The ECF was formed in 2004, and took charge in 2005. It replaced the British Chess Federation (BCF), the governing body of chess in England from 1904 until 2005. 

It was suggested that the BCF should change its name because only England came under its jurisdiction. It did not administer chess in the other countries of the UK. The BCF did have a British dimension, since it ran the British Chess Championship. This is one of two important tournaments held each year in Britain (the other is the annual international tournament at Hastings).

From the 1990s there was a campaign for the BCF to become a company limited by guarantee, to bid for more sponsorship money.

At the start of the 2005/6 season the English Chess Federation was created, inheriting the BCF's assets and personnel. The former BCF still exists for legacy purposes, but its website was inherited by the ECF. The Scottish and Welsh Federations hold their own championships every year as they did before. Therefore the change does not make much difference to most players.

The situation in Ireland is more complicated. The Irish Chess Union since 1912 was the governing body for both the Republic and Northern Ireland. In 2005 the Ulster Chess Union broke away from the Irish Chess Union. These two groups were part of the original British Chess Federation, but are not in any way connected to the new English Chess Federation. All groups except the Ulster Chess Union are members of the International Chess Federation FIDE, and the European Chess Union.

Ancient Beringian

The Ancient Beringians are the earliest known population of North America. They migrated from Beringia into Alaska  sometime before 11,500 years ago. They separated from other Paleo-Indians about 20,000 years ago. The discovery of an "Ancient Beringian" genome from the remains of two infants dated to 11,500 years ago was announced in January 2018.
The Ancient Beringians remained in the Arctic until they either became extinct or amalgamated with the Dene about five to six thousand years ago.

The Ancient Beringian were hunter-gatherers.  They ate wild plants and wild animals. Some of the animals they ate were salmon, ptarmigan, and ground squirrels.

Windows 3.1x

Windows 3.1 (codenamed Janus) is a series of 16-bit operating environments produced by Microsoft for use on personal computers. The series began with Windows 3.1, which was first sold during April 1992 as a successor to Windows 3.0. Subsequent versions were released between 1992 and 1994 until the series was superseded by Windows 95. During its lifespan, Windows 3.1 introduced several enhancements to the still MS-DOS-based platform, including improved system stability, expanded support for multimedia, TrueType fonts, and workgroup networking.

Windows 3.1 was originally released on April 6, 1992; official support for Windows 3.1 ended on December 31, 2001, and OEM licensing for Windows for Workgroups 3.11 on embedded systems continued to be available until November 1, 2008.

Windows 3.1 is the final version of Windows that supports 16-bit processors. Its successor, Windows 95, requires a 32-bit processor (also known as x86-based processor) in any supported architecture.

In November 1992, Microsoft released two versions of Windows for Workgroups: 3.1 and 3.11. 
In 1993, Microsoft released Windows 3.2, although only released in China and only fixed issues with the input system for simplified chinese.

On September 27, 1993, Microsoft released Windows NT 3.1. It was the first Windows NT version. It has better programming and more features. Windows NT is not a true update to Windows 3.1 as it does not share any kernel code with Windows 3.1. Instead it is based on the new 32-bit Windows NT kernel.

Transport in Singapore

Transport within Singapore is mainly land-based. Many parts of Singapore, including certain islands such as Sentosa and Jurong Island are accessible by road. The other major form of transportation within Singapore is rail: the Mass Rapid Transit which runs the length and width of Singapore, and the Light Rail Transit which runs within a few neighbourhoods. The main island of Singapore is connected to the other islands by ferryboat services.

Singapore also has a great deal of links to the rest of the world. There are two bridges which link Singapore to Malaysia – the Causeway, and the Second Link. The Singapore Changi Airport is a major aviation hub in Asia, and Singapore is a major transshipment port.

Singapore has one of the best public transport networks in the world, according to a study by London consulting firm Credo. Public transport includes bus, train, and taxi.

The public transport system is regulated by the Land Transport Authority, which oversees the three main modes of public transportation. Fare regulation and bus service standards are under the purview of an independent body, the Public Transport Council, while TransitLink, established by SBS Transit, SMRT Trains and SMRT Buses, helps to create an integrated multi-modal system with a common fare-payment mode, information platform, and a physical network without duplication of services.

The policies of the Land Transport Authority are meant to encourage the use of public transport in Singapore. The key aims are to provide an incentive to reside away from the Central district, as well as to reduce air pollution. Singapore has a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and Light Rail Transit (LRT) rail system consisting of five lines. There is also a system of bus routes throughout the island, most of which have air conditioning units installed due to Singapore's tropical climate. Besides cash, a contactless smart card called the EZ-Link card can be used to pay bus and MRT fares.

The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Singapore, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 84 min. 25% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 12 min, while 11% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7.3 km, while 16% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.

Launched in December 2007 by Land Transport Authority, Singapore Tourism Board and EZ-Link, the Singapore Tourist Pass offers unlimited travel for tourists to Singapore on Singapore's public transport system. For S$10 a day (S$20 for 3 days, as of April 2017) and with S$10 deposit, tourists can take any number of rides on buses and trains operated by SBS Transit, SMRT Buses and SMRT Trains. Certain buses like Night Rider, train service like Sentosa Express are not applicable. The Singapore Tourist Pass is available at selected MRT stations.

Singapore's public transport system has been mostly buses, until the opening of the first section of the Mass Rapid Transit in 1987. Although buses still enjoy an average daily ridership exceeding the number carried on both the MRT and LRT systems (3.9 million on buses, compared to 3.1 million on the MRT and LRT in the year 2016), the Land Transport Authority plans to expand the rail system such that buses will eventually play only a feeder role to an extensive rail network.

The current MRT network consists of five main lines, for a total network length of and with 119 stations. The North South Line, East West Line and Circle Line are operated by SMRT Trains (SMRT Corporation), while the North East Line and Downtown Line since 22 December 2013, are run by SBS Transit. The Circle Line Extension from Promenade to Marina Bay began operation since 14 January 2012.

Light rail transit functioning as feeders to the main MRT network has been under study for some time, particularly since the existing urban configuration of self-containing new towns spread out in the suburbs meant it was feasible to consider having light rail systems connecting each town to the MRT station in the town centre, a role which has traditionally been provided by feeder buses. Thus, the first SMRT Light Rail (SMRT Corporation) operated LRT was opened in Bukit Panjang in 1999 to provide a connection to Choa Chu Kang in neighbouring Choa Chu Kang New Town. Although subsequently hit by over 50 incidents, some of which resulted in several days of system suspension, similar systems albeit from a different company were introduced in Sengkang and Punggol in 2003 and 2005 respectively, both operated by SBS Transit.

Singapore has had other various forms of light urban rail systems, such as the monorail system on Sentosa island, which opened in February 1982. This 6.4 km, 6-station system was closed in March 2005 and a new Sentosa Express system was built by December 2006. The Changi Skytrain, a people mover system shuttling passengers between the three terminals at the Singapore Changi Airport, was opened originally in 1990 along with Terminal 2 and upgraded in 2006 with the completion of Terminal 3. The Jurong BirdPark previously featured an air-conditioned panorail which closed in 2012.

Taxicabs are a popular form of public transport in the compact sovereign city-state of Singapore, with fares considered relatively low compared to those in most cities in developed countries. As of December 2014, the total taxi fleet in Singapore was 28,736 taxis, operated by 6 taxi companies and 178 independent drivers. Taxis may be flagged down at any time of the day along any public road outside of the Central Business District (CBD). However, increased usage of Uber and Grab has resulted in a decrease in the usage of taxis.

There are six local scheduled service airlines, all of them operating from Singapore Changi Airport, offering scheduled flights to over 70 cities on six continents. The national flag carrier, Singapore Airlines, operates from Changi Airport Terminal 2 and 3. Its subsidiaries, SilkAir and Scoot, operate from Changi Airport Terminal 2.

Singapore's two budget airlines, Jetstar Asia Airways and Valuair, operate from Changi Airport Terminal 1. Only one budget airline, Tiger Airways, chose to operate at the Budget Terminal; other budget airlines have cited various reasons for not shifting operations to the Budget Terminal, including accessibility and ease of transfers to connecting flights.

There are 6 airlines operate from Singapore. these are 


The Singapore Cable Car, plies between Mount Faber on the main island of Singapore and the resort island of Sentosa as an alternative means of accessing that tourist attraction. The cable car system underwent a revamp that was completed in August 2010.

Water transport within the main island is limited to the River Taxi along the Singapore River. The service was introduced in January 2013, with low ridership. There are also daily scheduled ferry services from the Marina South Pier to the Southern Islands such as Kusu Island and Saint John's Island.

Singapore Cruise Centre (SCC) runs Tanah Merah and HarbourFront Ferry Terminals which are connected by ferry services to Indonesian Riau Islands of Batam, Bintan and Karimun. Commercial ferry services are available for booking with SCC's subsidiary SCC Travel Services which operates wowgetaways.com portal

Singapore aims to be Asia's aviation hub chiefly via the promotion of liberal aviation policies in a bid to encourage airlines to commence and maintain operations there. The aviation industry is regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, a statutory board of the Singapore government under the Ministry of Transport.

An open skies agreement was concluded with the United Kingdom in October 2007 permitting unrestricted services from Singapore by UK carriers. Singapore carriers were allowed to operate domestic UK services as well as services beyond London Heathrow to a number of destinations, including the United States along with Canada.

Singapore Changi Airport, with its four terminals, is one of the most important air hubs in the region. The international airport is situated at the easternmost tip of the main island, and serves 185 cities in 58 countries. With the recent opening of the third terminal, Changi is now capable of handling 64 million passengers every year.

Seletar Airport is Singapore's first civil aviation airport and is primarily used for private aviation today. The airport also serves limited scheduled commercial flights by Berjaya Air to the Malaysian islands of Tioman Island and Redang Island.

There are boats and ferry services to nearby islands of Malaysia and Indonesia. These services can be found at Changi Ferry Terminal, Changi Point Ferry Terminal, Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal, Singapore Cruise Centre and Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore.

The Port of Singapore, run by the port operators PSA International (formerly the Port of Singapore Authority) and Jurong Port, is the world's busiest in terms of shipping tonnage handled 1.04 billion gross tons were handled in the year 2004, crossing the one billion mark for the first time in Singapore's maritime history. Singapore also emerged as the top port in terms of cargo tonnage handled with 393 million tonnes of cargo in the same year, beating the Port of Rotterdam for the first time in the process. In 2006, it handled a total of 448 million tonnes of cargo.

Singapore is ranked second globally in terms of containerised traffic, with 21.3 million Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) handled in 2004, and is also the world's busiest hub for transshipment traffic. Additionally, Singapore is the world's largest bunkering hub, with 23.6 million tonnes sold in 2004.

In 2007, the Port of Singapore was ranked the world's busiest port, surpassing Hong Kong and Shanghai. The Port of Singapore is also ranked the Best Seaport in Asia.

The international railway line to Malaysia is an extension of the Malaysian rail network operated by Keretapi Tanah Melayu (Malayan Railways). Since 1 July 2011, Woodlands Train Checkpoint serves as the southern terminus of the KTM rail network. Previously, KTM trains terminated at Tanjong Pagar railway station in central Singapore. Two more rail links are being planned: the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail terminating in Jurong East, and the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System between Woodlands North and Bukit Chagar, Johor Bahru.

MRT trains run through tunnels and viaducts along the following lines:


LRT trains run on viaducts along the following lines:


Singapore has two land links to Malaysia. The Johor-Singapore Causeway, built in the 1920s to connect Johor Bahru in Johor, Malaysia to Woodlands in Singapore, carries a road and a railway line. The Tuas Second Link, a bridge further west, was completed in 1996 and links Tuas in Singapore to Tanjung Kupang in Johor.

Singapore pioneered the modern use of toll roads to enter the most congested city centre area with the Singapore Area Licensing Scheme, which has since been replaced with the Electronic Road Pricing, a form of electronic toll collection.


Traffic drives on the left which is typical in Commonwealth countries.


The influence of expressways on Singapore's transport policy developed shortly after independence during the history of Singapore because of frequent traffic congestion in the Central district. The aim was to encourage residential development in other parts of the island and give residents in these new "satellite towns" a convenient link between their homes and their workplaces (which were mostly situated around the city centre.)

Plastic pollution

Plastic pollution is when there is a lot of plastic in the environment and it negatively affects animals, animal habitats or people. Many things are made of plastic because it is inexpensive and durable. Most plastics will not biodegrade, so they stay in the environment for a long time. That results in a lot of plastic pollution in the environment. They are the Shanghai Sharks,

Hans Scholl

Hans Fritz Scholl (22 September 1918 Crailsheim Germany 22 February 1943 Munich) was the leader of the White Rose Resistance group. Along with Alexander Schmorell, Christoph Probst, Willi Graf, Sophie Scholl, and Kurt Huber, Hans wrote and distributed six different leaflets criticizing Hitler and Hitler Germany. On February 18, 1943, Hans was captured by the Gestapo. After four days of interrogation, he was executed by guillotine on February 22, 1943.

Hans Scholl was the son of the mayor Robert Scholl (1891-1973) and his wife Magdalene Scholl (1881-1958). His siblings were Inge Scholl, Elizabeth Scholl, Sophie Scholl, and Werner Scholl. The family moved Forchtenberg in 1929. When Hitler came into power, Hans and his siblings joined the Hitler Youth against the wishes of his parents, who were devout Christians and did not approve of the course Hitler was taking with the formerly illustrious country.

the turning point came for Hans when he was the flag bearer for a Hitler youth rally. This was a great honor, but when Hans came back from the rally, instead of being elated and happy, he came home depressed. He later explained that he had seen that freedom of expression wasn’t allowed or accepted in Hitler’s Germany. Instead, public conformity was the law. Whether or not this caused him to begin to innerly revolt against Hitler, he was even more inspired to revolt in 1937 when he was captured for being part of an illicit anti nazi christian group known as d.j.1.11. He was held in prison for six weeks. At his trial, he was accused of being part of the Christian Youth Group and also of having a homosexual relationship. he was set free for both offenses, but this persecution left a lasting impact on him. 

After graduation from the high school he did work service in Göppingen. In November he began to military service in Bad Cannstatt. In 1938 after ending military training Hans began studying medicine placement. In May 1940 he was a paramedic in France. 

In 1942, Hans, along with his good friend Alexander Schmorell, started an Anti-Nazi resistance group. Calling themselves The White Rose (and later, The Resistance Movement in Germany), the two young men wrote leaflets denouncing the state of Nazi Germany and calling for passive resistance. They then mailed the leaflets to officials and intellectuals around Munich. The first four leaflets were written from June 1942-July 1942. In July 1942, Hans and Alexander (as well as their good friend Willi Graf) received notice that they were being deployed to Russia for a three month stint as medics. They left Munich on July 23, 1942. During there three months there, the young men saw horrifying things, including the Warsaw Ghetto. What they saw inspired them to step up their leaflet game. When they returned to Munich, Hans and Alexander, as well as Willi Graf, Christoph Probst, and Sophie Scholl, began to step up their efforts. They were soon joined by Sophie’s philosophy teacher Kurt Huber. Together, these six individuals made up the core of the White Rose Resistance. In January 1943, the fifth leaflet was released. While the other pamphlets had only about a hundred distributed, about 10,000 copies were made of the fifth leaflet, which was distributed all around Germany by the members, who braved trains swarming with Gestapo to post their letters from different places in Germany. 

On February 3, inspired by a student protest against Hitler, Hans, Willi and Alexander went out in the middle of the night to graffiti Munich with slogans such as “Down with Hitler,” “Hitler the mass murderer”, and “Freedom!” They repeated these graffiti campaigns on February 8 and February 15. 

On February 9, Kurt Huber gave Hans his draft for the sixth pamphlet. Hans agreed with most of the pamphlet, but decided to remove a section against Huber’s wishes. This infuriated Huber, who left the encounter angry and upset. He never saw Hans again.

On the morning of February 18, Hans and Sophie snuck into the University while classes were going. Spreading leaflets in the halls, they began to leave the university when Sophie realized she still had more leaflets in her briefcase. Hurrying up to the top floor of the University, they began to distribute the remaining leaflets. They were still up there when the bell signaling the end of classes rang. Panicked, Sophie grabbed the last stack of flyers and threw them over the balcony and into the "Lichtlof", or indoor atrium. This action was noticed by Jakob Schmid, who was a custodian working in the atrium as the papers fell. Schmid, who was also a Nazi Party Member, locked the exit doors and alerted the Gestapo, who came and arrested Sophie and Hans. For four days Hans was interrogated. At first he denied everything, but when he realized that denying was pointless he changed his story, taking all of the blame in order to protect the other members who hadn’t been captured yet. Unfortunately, Hans had had a leaflet draft written by Christoph on his person when he was arrested. Christoph, who had bowed off the group due to being married with three children, was captured on February 20. On February 22, Hans, Sophie and Christoph were tried by Roland Freisler, a hard judge known as the “hanging judge” for sentencing up to 90% of the accused to death. The verdict was as expected as it was sad: death by guillotine. Hans and the others were hustled off to prison, where they learned the shocking news that the execution was to take place that same day. Hans and Sophie were able to see their parents before they died.

at around 5 pm, the guards came for Sophie, who was the first to be executed. A few minutes later, the guards came back for Hans. As the ax fell he yelled, “Es leibe die Freiheit!” (Let freedom live!)

Today, the White Rose group, and particularly the Scholl siblings, are commonly know in Germany. Between them, Sophie and Hans have about 200 schools and public institutions named after them in Germany.

Three movies have been made about the White Rose:

"Fünf Letzten Tage (Five Final Days), 1982"

"Die Weiße Rose (The White Rose), 1982"

"Sophie Scholl, Die Letzten Tage (Sophie Scholl, the Final Days), 2005"

Ernst Heinrich Weber

Ernst Heinrich Weber (24 June 1795 – 26 January 1878) was a German physician. He was one of the founders of experimental psychology. Weber was an influential and important figure in the areas of physiology and psychology during his lifetime and beyond. His studies on sensation and touch, and his emphasis on good experimental techniques were notable. They gave new direction and areas of study to future psychologists, physiologists, and anatomists.

Weber was born into an academic background, with his father serving as a professor at the University of Wittenberg. Weber became a doctor, specializing in anatomy and physiology. Two of his younger brothers, Wilhelm and Eduard, were also influential in academia, both as scientists. One did physics and the other anatomy. Ernst became a lecturer and a professor at the University of Leipzig and stayed there until his retirement.

Maupertuis made an expedition to Lapland to determine the shape of the Earth. He is often credited with having invented the principle of least action; a version is known as Maupertuis's principle – an integral equation that determines the path followed by a physical system. His work in natural history is interesting in relation to modern science, since he touched on aspects of heredity and the struggle for life.

Magnosaurus (meaning 'large lizard') was a theropod dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic of England. The main species, "Magnosaurus nethercombensis" has poorly preserved remains. It has often been confused with or included in "Megalosaurus".

In 1923, German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene named "Megalosaurus nethercombensis" from a partial skeleton. It was found in the nineteenth century by W. Parker in Dorset. Fossils came from a possible juvenile individual. Huene interpreted it as a more primitive species of "Megalosaurus".

The remains are just a few fragments. Details of its anatomical features are unknown. It would have been a bipedal carnivore of moderate size for a dinosaur.

Poekilopleuron

Poekilopleuron (meaning "varied ribs") is a megalosauroid dinosaur. The genus has been used under many different spelling variants, although only one, "Poekilopleuron", is valid. The type species is "P. bucklandii" (see also "Megalosaurus"), named after William Buckland, and many junior synonyms of it have also been erected. Few material is currently known, as the holotype was destroyed in World War II, although many casts of the material still exist.

"Poekilopleuron" is a genus of theropod with a long and complex history. The genus was first named and described by Jacques-Amand Eudes-Deslongchamps in a report published in 1836, based on holotype material that is now destroyed. In 1837, Eudes-Deslongchamps published a more detailed account of this discovery in a monograph which was also inserted next year in volume 6 of the "Mémoires de la Société Linnéenne Normandie".

The holotype, which was housed in Musée de la Faculté des Sciences de Caen and destroyed during World War II, included gastralia, phalanges, a left forelimb, caudal vertebrae, chevrons, ribs and a hindlimb. Of all the material, few is still preserved, although the gastralia, phalanges and forelimb were casted.

In the same 1836 publication, Eudes-Deslongchamps also named the type species of "Poekilopleuron", "P. bucklandii". Eudes-Deslongchapms noted similarities with some material of "Megalosaurus bucklandii" and "Poekilopleuron", and chose the species name "bucklandii" for "Poekilopleuron", so that it the two genera were synonymized, only the genus name would be suppressed. The generic name is derived from Greek ποίκιλος, "poikilos", "varied", and πλευρών, "pleuron", "rib", a reference to the three types of rib present. The specific name, honouring William Buckland, was deliberately identical to that of "Megalosaurus bucklandii".

Sivana is tempted by sin and the Wizard tells him he will never be good enough. Shazam then sends him back to the world to the very moment that he left. Sivana panics and his father accidentally crashes his car and permanently breaks his legs. Sivana's brother blames him for what happened and hates him ever since. Sivana later becomes a doctor and pays for an experiment to reverse engineer what happened to him that way he could enter Shazam's world and fight Shazam. Dr Sivana then strikes a deal with the Seven Deadly Sins to become a supervillain in exchange for power. Dr. Sivana then kills his father and brother. 

In the present, Billy Batson is taken in by a new family after having repeatedly run away from foster homes to try to find his mother who was accidentally separated from him at a carnival when he was a young child. Billy meets his new foster brother Freddie who knows everything there is to know about superheroes and who walks with a crutch. Billy finds Freddie annoying. He then sees two bullies beat Freddie up with his crutch and does nothing until they make fun of Freddie for not having a mother. Billy then attacks and beats Freddie's bullies. Billy then runs away and gets onto a train. The wizard Shazam then appears to Billy and tells him that he is worthy of his power. The wizard tells him to say the name Shazam and transform into a superhero with his powers. Billy says Shazam and transforms into an adult superhero. Billy then reaches out to Freddie to find out how to be a superhero and transforms back by saying Shazam. Billy becomes arrogant because of his power and so he chooses not to transform into his superhero form and visit Freddie as his hero at the school’s next lunch like Freddie had said he would. When no superhero showed up, they gave Freddie a suitcase wedgie. Freddie then came to Billy while Billy was in his superhero form during a public appearance and tells him he only cares about himself. Dr. Sivana then comes and attacks Billy. Billy tries and fails to fight Dr.Sivana and he transforms back into a teenager by saying Shazam so that he can escape. Dr. Sivana attacks Freddie and threatens to kill him if he doesn’t tell him where Billy lives. Freddie tells him. Dr. Sivana then kidnaps Billy’s foster family to get Billy to come to their rescue. Billy strikes a deal with Dr.Sivana to give up his powers in exchange for his foster family but instead of giving Dr. Sivana his power he gives his powers to his family by having them say Shazam. Dr.Sivana has six of the Seven Deadly Sins try to fight against Billy and his family but they are defeated. Billy then manages to trick the Sin of Envy to leave Dr. Sivana and fight Billy himself. 
After Billy wins Dr. Sivana is left without power and is captured and imprisoned. Billy in his superhero form then visits Freddie at his cafeteria lunch and brings Superman with him.

Bad News (video game)

Bad News is a free online browser game in which players strive to become a fake news tycoon. The game is classified as a serious game and a newsgame aimed at improving media literacy and social impact. The game was produced by the Dutch media organization "DROG" in collaboration with University of Cambridge scientists Jon Roozenbeek and Sander van der Linden. The game has been described by the media as a "fake news vaccine". 

The purpose of the game is to immunize the public against misinformation by letting players take on the role of a fake news producer. In the game, players can earn "badges", each of which correspond to common techniques used in the production of fake news, such as polarization, conspiracy theories, discrediting, trolling, and invoking emotion. The goal is to build your own fake news empire and gain as many followers as possible while maintaining credibility. The game is loosely based on a psychological concept known as inoculation theory, where prior exposure and familiarity with common fake news tactics is thought to help confer resistance or mental immunity against fake news.

1811–1812 New Madrid earthquakes

This refers to a series of earthquakes near the town of New Madrid, in late 1811, and early 1812. They are known as the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes. The town is right next to the Mississippi River. This was the largest earthquake known in the United States in recorded history.

The first shock was on December 16, 1811. It had a magnitude of 7.5-7.9 on the Richter scale. There also was an aftershock of magnitude 7.4 on the same day. They were the most powerful earthquakes to hit the contiguous United States east of the Rocky Mountains in recorded history. We use the word "contiguous" because we wish to exclude Hawaii and Alaska, neither of which was then part of the United States.

The earthquakes occurred in and near the Mississippi River town of New Madrid. The town was part of the Louisiana Territory at the time. Today, it is in the US state of Missouri.

There are estimates that these stable continental region earthquakes were felt strongly over an area of , and moderately across nearly 3 million km (1 million sq mi). The 1906 San Francisco earthquake, by comparison, was felt moderately over roughly . There were in all three earthquakes, and each had major aftershocks.

Different American Indian tribes interpreted these earthquakes, and came to a consensus: the powerful earthquake had to have meant something. For many tribes in Tecumseh's pan-Indian alliance, it meant that Tecumseh and his brother the Prophet must be supported.

Even today, earthquakes happen in this area, known as the New Madrid Seismic Zone (or NMSZ). Scientists think that before 2050 there is a chance of over 90% that quakes with a magnitude of over 7.0 on the Richter scale will occur there. Arthur C. Clarke wrote a story called Richter 10, where he describes a scenario like this.

Other seismic activity is known from fault zones within tectonic plates. They include the Charleston earthquake on in 1886. This was particularly surprising as the area had almost no history of even minor earthquakes.

There is a variety of natural habitats in Monterey: the closed-cone pine forest has pines whose cones only open after a fire (this is called "seroteny"). The idea is that the seeds drop onto ground with few occupants, so have the best chance of developing into trees. Coast live oaks often grow nearby.

This station is in close proximity to one-north, a high technology business parks made up of biomedical science, infocomm technology and media industries.

Buona Vista station opened on 12 March 1988, as part of Phase 1B of the MRT line which runs from Outram Park to Clementi.

In the late 1990s to early 2000s, a temporary overhead bridge was built across North Buona Vista Road, leading into the concourse level.

With the construction of the Circle Line from 11 January 2005, the bridge was demolished and replaced with a newer one. The second storey of the EW Line station was also converted into a transfer level between the two lines. The Circle Line part was opened on October 8, 2011, while the two new exits share the same location as the original one.

Following the 25 March 2006 accident, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) made the decision in 2008 to install Platform Screen Doors in this station, whereby operations commenced on 10 June 2011.

The lifts were upgraded in August 2009 and had been the last station to be barrier-free, due to the big size of the station.

The artwork featured under the Art in Transit programme is "The Tree of Life" by Gilles Massot. Located on the lift shaft in the underground station, the artwork depicts a eucalyptus tree located at the nearby Kent Ridge Park that has been digitally edited to create an effect similar to David Hockney's photo montages. The tree also represents the jungle greenery which used to exist next to the above-ground station and is a result of the deep impression left on the artist of the landscape and view of the area.

Swanscombe Heritage Park

Swanscombe Heritage Park or Swanscombe Skull Site is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest Swanscombe in north-west Kent. The site has two Geological Conservation Review sites, and a National Nature Reserve.

The park is in a former gravel quarry, Barnfield Pit. The area was already famous for numerous Palaeolithic-era handaxes—mostly Acheulean and Clactonian artifacts, some as much as 400,000 years old.

In 1935/1936 work at Barnfield Pit uncovered two fossilised skull fragments. These fragments were the remains of Swanscombe Man. The bones were later found to have belonged to a young woman. The Swanscombe skull were early Neanderthal, dating to the Hoxnian Interglacial around 400,000 years ago.

They are one of only two sites in Britain which have yielded Lower Palaeolithic human fossils, together with the 500,000-year-old "Homo heidelbergensis" leg bones and teeth at Boxgrove.

The skull fragments were found in the lower middle terrace gravels at a depth of almost eight metres beneath the surface. Further excavations, carried out between 1968-1972 uncovered more animal bone and flint tools, and established the extent of a former shoreline that the bones were found on.

Most of the bone finds are now in the Natural History Museum in London, and the stone finds are at the British Museum. The other key paleolithic sites in the UK are Happisburgh, Pakefield, Pontnewydd, Kents Cavern, Paviland, and Gough's Cave.

Happisburgh

Happisburgh, pronounced "Hazeborough", is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. The village is on the coast, to the east of a north-south road, the B1159. Its population is under 1,000.

This small place became a site of national archaeological importance in 2010. Flint tools over 800,000 years old were unearthed. This is the oldest evidence of human occupation anywhere in the UK. In May 2013, a series of early human footprints were discovered on the beach at the site, providing direct evidence of early human activity at the site. Rough seas had eroded the sandy beach. This uncovered some elongated hollows.


Firuz Shah Tughluq

Sultan Firuz Shah Tughluq (1309 – 20 September 1388) was a Muslim ruler of the Tughluq Dynasty, who reigned over the Delhi Sultanate from 1351 to 1388. His father's name was Rajab (the younger brother of Ghazi Malik) who had the title "Sipahsalar". He succeeded his cousin Muhammad bin Tughlaq following the latter's death in 1351 at Thatta in Sindh, where Muhammad bin Tughlaq had gone in pursuit of Taghi the Muslim ruler of Gujarat. For the first time in the history of Delhi Sultanate, a situation was confronted wherein nobody was ready to accept the reins of power. With much difficulty, the camp followers convinced Firuz to accept the responsibility. In fact, Khawaja Jahan, the Wazir of Muhammad bin Tughlaq had placed a small boy on throne claiming him to be the son of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, who meekly surrendered afterwards. Firuz Shah Tughlaq thereafter reigned upon the throne of Delhi and took control of the Delhi Sultanate. Due to widespread unrest, his realm was much smaller than Muhammad's. Tughlaq was forced by rebellions to concede virtual independence to Bengal and other provinces. However, he reconquered Bengal in 1364. Firuz Shah Tughlaq was a religious Sunni Muslim who established Sharia across his entire sultanate. In Delhi, Firuz Shah Tughlaq constructed a jamia masjid called Jamia-i-Miri ("mosque of miri") and asked all the Muslim scholars (ulama) and mystics to assemble there for the Friday prayers.

Alpine orogeny

The Alpine orogeny (sometimes Alpide orogeny) is the building of mountain ranges in central and southern Europe and west Asia.
This mountain-building phase started in the later Mesozoic era. It happened as the two large continents Africa and India (plus a smaller plates) moved north and collided with Eurasia. This happened at the end of the Mesozoic era, and is slowly continuing today.

So this slow collision sqeezed the Eurasian plates, and caused mountains to build from the western edge far into Asia. These are the mountain ranges of the Alpide belt. They include (from west to east) the Atlas, the Rif, the Baetic Cordillera, the Cantabrian Mountains, the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Apennine Mountains, the Dinaric Alps, the Hellenides, the Carpathian Mountains, the Balkan Mountains, the Taurus, the Armenian Highlands, the Caucasus, the Alborz, the Zagros, the Hindu Kush, the Pamir, the Karakoram, and the Himalayas.

The Alpine orogeny also led to more distant and smaller geological features such as the chalk hills in southern England and northern France (the 'Weald–Artois Anticline'). The remains of this can be seen in the chalk ridges of the North and South Downs in southern England. Its effects are visible on the Isle of Wight, where the chalk and overlying Eocene strata are folded to near-vertical, as seen at Alum Bay and Whitecliff Bay, and on the Dorset coast near Lulworth Cove.

The Alpine orogeny was the last of the three major phases of orogeny in Europe that made its geology. The Caledonian orogeny which formed the Old Red Sandstone continent was the first. The second was the Variscan orogeny. That was when Pangaea formed as Gondwana and the Old Red Sandstone continent collided in the middle to late Palaeozoic.

Rockstar North

Rockstar North Limited (former DMA Design Limited) is a British video game developer based in Edinburgh, Scotland.

The company was founded as Acme Software in Dundee in 1984. The founders were classmates David Jones, Russell Kay, Steve Hammond, and Mike Dailly. It was renamed DMA Design in 1987. During its early years, the publishing company Psygnosis backed DMA Design, and it focused mainly on making games for the Amiga, Atari ST and Commodore 64 game systems. During this time, DMA created successful shooters such as "Menace" and "Blood Money", but it soon turned to platform games after the release of "Lemmings" in 1991. "Lemmings" was an international success and led to several sequels and spin-offs. After developing "Unirally" for Nintendo, DMA Design was set to become one of their main second-party developers, but this partnership ended after Nintendo's disapproval of "Body Harvest".


Charles W. Steger

Charles William Steger Jr. (June 16, 1947 – May 6, 2018) was an American architect and engineer. He was the 15th president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) in Blacksburg, Virginia, United States. 

Steger was President during the Virginia Tech massacre of April 16, 2007, in which 32 people were killed and another 17 were injured by Seung-Hui Cho in two buildings on opposite sides of the sprawling campus. Steger called the shootings "a tragedy of monumental proportions." 

On May 14, 2013, Steger announced that he would step down as the President of Virginia Tech. He was succeeded on June 1, 2014 by Timothy D. Sands, Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost at Purdue University. 

Steger died on May 6, 2018 in his home in Blacksburg, Virginia at the age of 70.
