ITV Channel Television previously known as Channel Television, is a British television station which has been serving the Channel Islands since the station launched in 1962. The company is based in Jersey and shows regional programmes for the ITV network. Until November 2011, Channel Television was one of four ITV companies that was not owned by ITV plc with the two STV regions in Scotland and UTV in Northern Ireland. Since 2012, ITV plc has owned the station and the broadcasting licence was moved to ITV Broadcasting Limited in March 2017.

Channel Television was awarded the licence for the Channel Islands in 1960 by the regulator at the time, the Independent Television Authority (ITA). The ITA pointed out the Television Act 1954 that started ITV and the ITA did not include the Channel Islands, and if the ITA was to have an ITV service there, it would require an extension of the act with an Order in Council. The station also faced difficulty with connecting to the rest of the ITV network. The solution was to create a relay station on the island of Alderney that would connect with another ITV station, originally Westward Television. The station also had issues getting permission for the mast but they gained permission in September 1961.

Elsa Binder

Eliszewa "Elsa" Binder (between 31 January and 13 March 1920 on or after 18 June 1942), was a Polish–born Jewish girl who kept a diary in which she documented her life as a Jew during the Holocaust. During the Holocaust, she also courageously helped the other Jews imprisoned in her quarter, by smuggling food, money, and other supplies. She died around the age of 22.

She gained some posthumous fame in her homeland because of her diary, in which she documents her life as a Jew during the Holocaust in 1941 and 1942.

Binder was born in Stanislawów, Poland, in modern-day Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine, between January and March 1920, where she was raised. In September 1939, the Germans began invading Poland (with the help of the Soviet Union) and after occupation began in October, they began persecuting Jews in Poland.In June 1941, the Binder family were trapped in Stanislawów, when the Germans eventually reached their city. Binder lost her citizenship and became stateless. As the persecutions of the Jewish population increased in December 1941, the Binder family were taken into captivity in a quarter in Stanislawów, where Binder lost her younger sister Dora there in 1942.

From 23 December 1941 until 18 June 1942, she had kept a diary which she wrote in it regularly. 

After World War II ended in 1945, Andrea Axt, Binder's cousin, who had escaped Poland and fled to the United Kingdom, returned to Poland after the war ended, and was given Binder's diary. Axt tried to publish the diary but to no avail.

Binder was born Eliszewa Binder between January and March 1920 in Stanislawów, Poland (modern-day Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine) to Polish-born Jewish parents, the eldest of three children. The other two being named Dora and Bronek. Her father died in 1925, thus leaving her mother widowed, for a while. Her mother then remarried, but after a few years, her mother divorced him, discovering he was having a affair, without her knowledge. When she divorced him, she was pregnant with a fourth child. The divorce led the Binder family to be in a state of homelessness twice. Her mother managed to rent a apartment for her and the children. In 1933, Binder joined a group of Zionists, and made some friends to. Her mother remarried for the third time. The husband, being a landlord of their apartment, was very abusive to the children, with Binder's mother refusing to act. This led Binder to move in with strangers who also abused her. The reason she moved in with them, was because she had some freedom and independence. She then returned to live with her mother and siblings.

In September 1939, Germany invaded and occupied the western part of Poland with the help of the Soviet Union, who attacked the eastern side of Poland, when Binder was 19 years old.
In June 1941, the Germans eventually reached Stanislawów, the city where the Binder family lived. This was becuase, Germany attempted to invade the Soviet Union and occupy the remainder of Poland.

Under the Soviet occupation of Poland, conditions were crucial for the Binder family. 
On October 12, 1941, Germans killed ten thousand Jews in Stanislawów (where Binder lived) in a massacre where Binder lost her sister Bronek in the massacre.
In December 1941; two months later, the Binder family were taken into captivity in a ghetto (in the same city where Binder lived), where Binder lost her younger sister Dora there in 1942.

On 23 December 1941, Binder wrote the first entry in her diary.

In a entry dated 27 December 1941 (four days after the first one), she wrote about the dangers in the quarter, and that people who live in the ghetto are in constant threat and fear of poverty, violence, starvation, and death. Binder then writes that she had a fight with her mother and were upset at each other for a few days. She then goes on to write that no matter what moods the two are in, she is Binder's most favorite person and that Binder loves her the most, for she is her "best friend", but that when she sees her mother treats her younger sister Dora, this always makes her "blood boil" and that she becomes "jealous" of her younger sister. She also writes that she does not believes that her mother "loves her younger sister Dora as much as she loves her, but that she demands more from her and is indulgent to Dora". Binder then writes that "she has to express herself more often and more sincerely". She also writes that "she thinks it is very naive and silly, for her to read what she just wrote in her diary". Then she writes that this is her way of thinking. Then she writes "that she apologizes for writing that in her diary without realization", "but that regardless of this discovery, she will continue to write her diary, but that next time she will not read what she just wrote in her diary, right away".

Writing this, Binder was apparently aware that the atmosphere of continual crisis was distorting her normal attitudes and emotions. She felt the need to discuss her feelings but that she could only confide safely in her diary.

The last entry written in Binder's diary is dated 18 June 1942. 

Nothing is known about the death of Elsa Binder, but she was obviously still alive by 18 June 1942, when she wrote the final entry in her diary. She most likely died in the quarter in Stanislawów or the Bełżec extermination camp. The exact circumstances of her death are not known for certain, but it is certain that Binder and her parents died during the Holocaust. Due to the fact that Binder's last diary entry dated 18 June 1942, ended abruptly in mid-sentence, and that Binder's diary was found in a ditch not far from a cemetery (used in the Stanislawów ghetto to shoot Jews to death) in June 1943, a death date of 18 June 1942, can be assumed. However, it is unknown how accurate that death date is.

The Girl from Ipanema

"Garota de Ipanema" ("The Girl from Ipanema") is a Brazilian bossa nova and jazz song. It was very popular in the mid-1960s and won a Grammy for Record of the Year in 1965. It was written in 1962, with music by Antônio Carlos Jobim and Portuguese lyrics by Vinícius de Moraes. English lyrics were written later by Norman Gimbel. It was first sung by Astrud Gilberto. 

The song is about 17 year old Heloísa Pinheiro. Songwriters Jobim and de Moraes saw her walking to the beach in Ipanema, a neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro.

In the US, the single peaked at number five on the "Billboard" Hot 100, and went to number one for two weeks on the Easy Listening chart.

Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald recorded covers of the song.

In 2001, the song's copyright owners sued Pinheiro for using the title of the song as the name of her boutique (Garota de Ipanema). In their complaint, they said that her status as The Girl from Ipanema did not give her the right to use the name that legally belonged to them. The court ruled in favor of Pinheiro.

It is believed to be the second-most recorded pop song in history, after "Yesterday" by The Beatles.

In 2004, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. 

The song became popular during the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics which were held in Rio de Janeiro. The Olympic and Paralympic mascots were named Vinicius and Tom after the song's co-writers by a public vote. The opening ceremony of the 2016 Olympics was themed around the song and the architecture of Oscar Niemeyer. Spotify said that the song had been streamed 40,000 times per day in the days after the ceremony.

Zürich Wilderness Park

Zürich Wilderness Park ("Wildnispark Zürich" in German) is a nature park located near the city of Zürich in Switzerland. It consists of two main areas: the Sihlwald forest and the Langenberg Wildlife Park. The Sihlwald forest is the biggest mixed forest in the Swiss Mittelland and the Langenberg Wildlife Park is the oldest wildlife park in Switzerland. These sites are located in the Sihl Valley, to the south of Zürich.

Hapsburgers gifted the Sihlwald forest to the city of Zürich in 1309 and again in 1524. It provided timber and firewood to the city for many years. Since the 1990s, the forest has been preserved by forest director Andreas Speich, who stopped cutting down trees to protect its unique composition. 

The Langenberg Wildlife Park was founded in 1869 by city forester Carl Anton Ludwig von Orelli.

On August 28, 2009, the Sihlwald forest was named a "regional nature park of national importance" by the FOEN (Federal Office for the Environment).

Zürich Wilderness Park was officially formed, bringing together the Langenberg Wildlife Park and the Sihlwald forest.

Today, the park welcomes more than half a million visitors every year. Visitors can barbecue, hike, cycle, ride horseback through the park.

Associated-Rediffusion

Associated-Rediffusion later known as Rediffusion London, was the ITV franchise for London on weekdays between 22 September 1955 and 29 July 1968. It was the first ITV station to broadcast, and was a part of the "Big Four" companies that produced most of the ITV programs during this period.

Rediffusion lost the London franchise in 1968 but merged with ABC to form Thames Television, which would serve London on weekdays from 1968 to 1992.

Associated-Rediffusion Television was originally a partnership between British Electric Traction (BET), its subsidiary Broadcast Relay Services Ltd. (Traded as Rediffusion), and Associated Newspapers, owner of the Daily Mail, which was interested in commercial broadcasting as early as the 1920s. The aftermath of the financial losses made by the ITV system, Associated Newspapers sold the majority of its share in the company to BET and Rediffusion, the company did not drop the "Associated" part of Associated-Rediffusion until 1964. Associated Newspapers later realised the potential of ITV, they became a significant investor in the ITV franchisee for the south, Southern Television and later became a shareholder on Independent Television News (ITN).

Boris Ford became Associated-Rediffusion's first head of schools broadcasting in 1957. During his role as head of schools broadcasting he persuaded Benjamin Britten to compose his church opera "Noye's Fludde" for a series of programmes. However, Ford was dismissed before the opera was produced, allegedly for shortcomings and inexperience in his administrative role.

In 1964, the company simplified its official name to "Rediffusion Television". Because of the new name they also rebranded the station as "Rediffusion London". In October 1967 the Independent Television Authority announced that the company would no longer serve the region after the contract expires in 1968. Due to changes in the ITV network, the weekend franchises in the Midlands and North of England being abolished. ABC Weekend TV, the holders of the now abolished weekend franchises tried applying for the London weekend franchise but the licence was awarded to the London Television Consortium. To preserve ABC, the ITA proposed ABC and Rediffusion make a new company: Thames Television. This was not a merger as commonly stated. ABPC, ABC's parent company and BET, Rediffusion's parent company, created Thames as a separate company. Thames would use staff from ABC's Teddington Studios and Rediffusion's Television House. BET took a 49% stake in Thames and was under-represented in the management. Rediffusion objected towards this and was given two options. Either Thames tok the contract or ABC took over. Rediffusion chose Thames Television and went of air on 29 July 1968 at 12:26 am. Rediffusion's employees at Wembley would work for London Weekend Television while the employees at Television House would work for Thames. Some staff re-located to Yorkshire Television in Leeds.

When Rediffusion launched in September 1955 they adopted a simple look, only having: the station name, and a spinning star called the Adastral. The ident was accompanied by a five note electronic tune, made by tapping out the morse code for 'A-R'.

In 1964, Rediffusion renamed itself from Associated Rediffusion to Rediffusion London, the look was altered to follow. The ident included: a black and grey background, the spinning Adastral star and a sliding animation. The five note tune was replaced by a seven note theme.

Hydrogen vehicle

Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles use hydrogen gas as a source of fuel to generate electricity. They are one of the cleanest forms of transportation. Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles use a fuel cell stack in order to convert the chemical energy that’s being stored in hydrogen into electrical energy, which will be used to power an electric motor. A Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicle starts with Hydrogen gas being stored inside a high pressure tank located within the vehicle. Then the hydrogen is given to the fuel cell stack, which is made of an Anode, Cathode, and an Electrolyte. Hydrogen molecules from the storage tanks are then introduced into the anode compartment of each fuel cell. The Hydrogen molecules then usually encounter a catalyst which makes the electrochemical reaction. The Electrochemical reaction is done with the help of the catalyst, which helps split the hydrogen molecules into protons, labeled “H+” and electrons which are labeled “e-”. Once this step is done, the protons move through the proton exchange membrane, while the electrons are forced to use an external circuit because the proton exchange membrane is very selective. While the electrons flow through the external circuit, this creates an electrical current, and this will power the electric motor found in the vehicle. On the other hand, Oxygen is provided to the cathode inside the fuel cell stack, which has the electrons that have taken the external path, and the protons. While inside, they are all mixed to create water (H2O), which will be the only thing the car will leave behind. Using this technology, we are able to assure that Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles will not produce anything that will harm the environment nor use any non-renewable resources aside from the transportation of the Hydrogen needed to power the vehicle. There are some issues with Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles. One of those issues is that it lacks a proper infrastructure. The reason is because one hydrogen fueling stations costs more than one million dollars to make. Another issue is that Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles are also really expensive, as the technology revolving around using hydrogen as fuel is still a fairly new concept, therefore it is also extremely expensive. Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles usually get great range, much more than gas and electric vehicles. Some examples of Hydrogen Vehicles are the Hyundai Nexo, Honda Insight, and the Toyota Mirai.

Taruga fastigo

Taruga fastigo is a frog. It lives in Sri Lanka. Scientists have seen it in exactly one place: Morningside Estate, near Sinharaja Forest Reserve, 1060 m above sea level.
The adult male frog is 35.3 to 39.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is about 54.8 to 63.9 mm long. The skin of the frog's back is brown or dark green in color. There is a mark on the frog's back that looks like an hourglass. There are bumps on the edges of the hourglass and near the rear end.

There are fewer of these frogs than there were. This is because human beings change the places where the frogs live. Human beings cut forests to get wood to build with and build farms.

Scientists name this frog "fastigo" because of its pointed nose.

Romerus

Romerus is a small genus of frogs in the family Rhacophoridae. They live in southern China (Hong Kong, Hainan, Guangxi, Guangdong). Some of the species in "Romerus" were in "Philautus". Scientists think "Romerus" might be the most basal genus in Rhacophorinae.

At first, scientists named this genus "Liuixalus" in 2008. They looked at the DNA and saw these frogs were different from the frogs in "Chiromantis." Scientists named the group "Liuixalus" after , a Chinese amphibian scientist. In 2021, scientists looked at the DNA again and decided "Romerus" would be a better name. The name "Romerus" is for British amphibian scientist John D. Romer.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) says two of these frog species are vulnerable ("Romerus ocellatus" and "R. hainanus"), one as endangered ("R. romeri"), and one as least-concern ("R. feii"). They do not know enough about "Romerus shiwandashan" to give it a rank.

Scientists named this frog "calcarius" for the Latin language word for "limestone." The frog lives where there is limestone karst rock.

Precocious puberty

Precocious puberty is a medical condition that causes children to develop puberty at a very young age. This usually happens before age 9 and the cause is mostly unknown. It is a rare condition.

Going through puberty too early creates medical and psychological problems. The person might not grow as tall as they could. They might feel very different from their friends and other children in school. Girls who go through puberty early have a bigger chance of being sexually assaulted. They also have a bigger chance of becoming pregnant while still a young teenager. There is a bigger chance that later in life they might get a cancer such as breast cancer, because there is a higher risk associated with the number of years the woman had between puberty (usually defined as menarche for studies) and the first time she has a baby. 

Drugs called puberty blockers can slow down or temporarily stop the process of puberty.

British Sugar

British Sugar plc is a subsidiary of Associated British Foods and is the main producer of sugar from sugar beet in the United Kingdom. It processes all sugar beet grown in the country and produces about two-thirds of the UK's sugar quota. The remaining sugar is produced by Tate & Lyle under license to American Sugar Refining, as well as through imports. British Sugar has a contract called the "Inter Professional Agreement" with growers, which determines the price paid for beet and the allocation of quotas. The National Farmers Union negotiates on behalf of the growers.

The company was established in 1936 when the British government nationalized the sugar beet processing industry.

Microstate

A microstate or ministate is a country that is very small in size, or has very little amounts of people living in it. Usually, both cases are true. However, there are no set definitions of the terms "state" and "very small".

Some examples that are usually called microstates include Andorra, Bahamas, Comoros, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Fiji, Guyana, Iceland, Kiribati, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Nauru, Palau, San Marino, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Western Sahara. The smallest state in the world is Vatican City, in the city of Rome.

In addition, Greenland has been included here for its possible wishes or chances of independence. Bougainville is also there for the same reason.

This is a criteria table to make sure that other countries are connected to its smallness.

Generally speaking, only a few countries of the world are so small, remote or lack a few resources that someone else uses these for even part of this year. These countries are tiny Islands, tiny landlocked countries, city states and sparsely populated countries.

The origin of the word "microstate" is Europe, specially in Andorra, Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City. Countries like Cyprus, Djibouti, Guyana, Iceland and Suriname are also microstates because their populations are so small. However, the qualifier for this is having an area of less than 6000 km² or a population of less than 1 000 000 people.

This is a table of all microstates according to the current CIA Factbook. In addition, states with limited recognition are included.

American eel

The American eel ("Anguilla rostrata") is a catadromous teleost fish in the family Anguillidae. It occurs in the Americas, from Greenland to Brazil. It has an elongated body like a snake. It lives in rivers and lakes, mostly in North and Central America. 

These eels are active during the night. At day they hide on the ground of the river or lake. They feed on insect larvae, worms, smaller fish and small crustaceans. To spawn, they migrate to the Sargasso Sea in the Atlantic Ocean. They grown to a length of about and a weight of up to .

The eggs hatch within a week of deposition in the Sargasso Sea. Fertilization is external, and adult eels are presumed to die after spawning. None has been reported to migrate up rivers.

The leptocephalus is the larval form, a stage strikingly different from the adult form the eels will grow into. Growth has been evaluated at about 0.21 to 0.38 mm per day.

As they enter the continental shelf, leptocephali metamorphose into glass eels (juveniles), which are transparent and have the typical snake shape of eels.

Glass eels become progressively pigmented as they approach the shore; these eels are termed elvers.

This is the sexually immature adult stage of American eel. They begin to develop a yellow color and a creamy or yellowish belly. In this phase, the eels are still mainly nocturnal.

As the maturation process proceeds, the yellow eel now turns into a silver eel.

American eels are nocturnal and most of their feeding occurs at night. They have a keen sense of smell, meaning they most likely depend on scent to find food. 

Little is known about the food habits of leptocephali. Recent studies suggest that leptocephali do not feed on zooplankton. They likely consume detrital particles such as marine snow and fecal pellets or particles such as discarded houses of larvacean tunicates.

Based on laboratory experiments on European glass eels, Lecomte-Finiger (1983) reported that they were morphologically and physiologically unable to feed. However, Tesch (1977) found that elvers at a later stage of pigmentation, stage VIA4, were feeding.

Elvers feed primarily on larvae.

Yellow eels are benthic omnivores that eat fish, mollusks, bivalves, crustaceans, insect larvae, surface-dwelling insects, worms, frogs and plants.

Janani Luwum

Janani Luwum (1922-1977), also known as Janani Jakaliya Luwum, was the Archbishop of the Church of Uganda between 1974 and 1977.

In 1971, Idi Amin took over the government by surprise from Milton Obote. While he was in power, he abused power by killing many people and others were disappearing in the country, without any trace.

Janani Luwum, who was the Archbishop of Uganda at that time, was not happy with the way people who opposed Idi Amin went missing. His position as the Archbishop of Uganda made it hard for him to remain silent about the harsh leadership of Idi Amin. So, together with other religious leaders in the country, he wrote a strong-worded letter of protest to Idi Amin, telling him to stop all the bad things he was doing to his people.

When Idi Amin received the message, he felt insulted by it and got Janani Luwum arrested and tried. Idi Amin eventually killed him by having his men shoot him to death in February 1977.

Since 2015 Uganda has a public holiday on 16 February, to celebrate the life of Janani Luwum, who has been described by Isaiah Ogedegbe as "the man who never made peace with oppression".

Kupala

Kupala is a fictional goddess from Slavic stories. She symbolizes peace, water, magic, plants, and the ability to have babies, even though old Slavic folks didn't actually pray to her. She has a twin brother named Kupalo who stands for male ability to have babies. Together with other gods, they make up a god of fertility. There's a special celebration called that her name comes from. The festival is Christian not pagan.

Jacob Grimm wrote a book called "Deutsche Mythologie" in 1835. In this book, he mentioned that Russians called their summer solstice bonfires "kupala". He also wrote that some people said "kupala" is the name of Kupulo. Kupulo is a god of harvest. Many experts say the word "kupala" means someone who takes a bath. The word comes from "kupat(i)" which means to take a bath. But not all experts agree. They say "kupala" is the name of a god. People believed in this god before Christianity came. They say it is not about John the Baptist.

Vyacheslav Ivanov and are two of these experts. They think "kupala" comes from the same old Indo-European word as "Cupid". Cupid is the Roman god of love. This old word means 'passion' or 'desire'.

Scholars now believe that nobody worshipped Kupala. They believe the name is derived from Kupala Night. Kupala Is believed to derive from the past tense conjugation of meaning to bathe, possibly to baptize in the name of John the Baptist. 
This special day marks the beginning of summer and the sun. People call it Kupalo. In the 4th century AD, it became a day to celebrate John the Baptist's birth. He lived before Jesus Christ. When people turned to Christianity, they connected the name "Kupala" with the Christian name "Ivan". This special day is known as "Ivan" and "Kupala" in Ukraine and Belarus. "Ivan" is another way to say John, like John the Baptist. "Kupala" may come from an older Slavic word, "kump". "Kump" means a group of people together.

Some people think these two holidays are related. They think it's because John baptized people by putting them fully in water. But the Kupala celebration happened before Christianity. When people became Christian, they changed the Kupala celebration a little. They made it part of the Christian traditions that also have local stories.

Else Alfelt (16 September 1910 – 9 August 1974) was a Danish artist known for her abstract paintings. She was one of two female members of the CoBrA art movement, an art group. She was married to Carl-Henning Pedersen, who was also a prominent CoBrA member.

Alfelt was born in Copenhagen to Carl Valdemar Ahlefeldt and Edith Alexandra Regine Julie Thomsen. She started painting at a young age and taught herself as an artist. When her parents divorced, she was sent to an orphanage by her father's new wife. At around 12 years old, she began to learn painting by observing and drawing the people and surroundings at the orphanage.

At 15, Alfelt attended the Technical School in Copenhagen for two years. She applied to the Art Academy in Copenhagen, but was rejected because the school believed she already had the necessary painting skills. 

In 1933, at the age of 23, she attended the International Folk High School in Elsinore. There she met her future husband, Carl-Henning Pedersen. They quickly married, and their daughter, Vibeke Alfelt, was born in 1934. During the period from 1934 to 1937, the couple faced financial struggles but continued to find inspiration. They painted on used canvases to keep creating art. This is how Pedersen began painting, as his wife gave him a used canvas and encouraged him to make it his own.

Ahlefeldt started submitting her artwork to the annual Autumn Salon of Danish artists in 1929. However, her work was not accepted until 1936 when she displayed two realistic portraits. After that, Alfelt's painting style shifted completely to abstract paintings that were meditative and colorful.

During the 1930s to 1950s, she became a part of the avant-garde art movements in Denmark. She was part of Linien, an artists' group and art journal. During World War II, under the German occupation, Alfelt played an important role in Helhesten, another artists' group and art journal. It was a plce for experimental art and resistance against the occupation. After the war, she became an important member of CoBrA.

Alfelt's artwork included spirals, mountains, and spheres, which she associated with "inner space" expressions. She drew inspiration from nature, particularly mountains. She traveled to places like Lapland in 1945 and Japan in 1967 to seek inspiration. In addition to paintings, she also created several mosaic artworks.

In 1961, she received the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat award.
In Herning, there is a Carl Henning Pedersen and Else Alfelts Museum. This museum dedicated to the works of Carl Henning Pedersen and Else Alfelt. In Copenhagen there is a road named Else Alfelts Vej in her honor. In September 2010, the museum organized a major exhibition called "Else Alfelt – The Aesthetics of Emptiness" to celebrate her 100th birthday. The exhibition ran for five months and highlighted her importance as one of the most significant women artists in Danish modernism.

Colour Strike

The Color Strike was industrial action by technicians working for the ITV network. It was from 13 November 1970 to 8 February 1971. The strike was caused by a pay dispute between the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians (ACTT) and the management of the ITV companies.

At the time, ITV had recently switched to transmitting programs in color. This needed new equipment. The cameras had four tubes: three were for the color information (Red, Green and Blue) and one for the black and white information (called luminance). The black and white information was need as most houses didn't have sets to show a color picture. The striking technicians turned off the color tubes causing the cameras to only pick up the black and white signal and therefore causing the programs to be recorded in black and white.

Because of the strike, the ITV companies couldn't sell advertisement spaces for the increased price that color demanded.



Elia (sculpture)

Elia is a sculpture in Herning, Denmark, created by Ingvar Cronhammar. The sculpture is a big round dome with four tall columns that are 32 meters (105 ft) high. The dome has a diameter of 60 meters (200 ft). Inside the sculpture, there is a large tube that shoots flames randomly into the air. The flames can go up to 8 meters (26 ft) high and last for about 25 seconds. These bursts of flames happen randomly, usually every two months. However, they won't happen if the weather is too windy or if people are too close to the sculpture. The sculpture opened in September 2001. It costed 23 million Danish krone.

On October 30, 2016, a 21-year-old man fell down the center of the sculpture and died. Two months later, on December 29, 2016, a woman also died by jumping into the center, which was believed to be a suicide. As a result of these incidents, a safety net was installed around the sculpture. During the installation, one of the workers fell from a height and was taken to the hospital by ambulance. On March 23, 2021, a 46-year-old man died while performing maintenance inside one of the steel pipes of the sculpture.

Ingvar Cronhammar

Ingvar Cronhammar (17 December 1947 – 20 May 2021) was a sculptor from Sweden and Denmark known for his large, dark, and provocative works.

Ingvar Cronhammar was born in Hässleholm in the south of Sweden. He moved to Denmark in 1965, where he studied at the Jutland Art Academy in Aarhus. 

His early works were influenced by American environmental art. They featured live chickens with lamps strapped to their backs and chairs covered with pigskin. As his career progressed, Cronhammar created larger works. Examples include "The Gate", a steel machine representing death, and "Elia" (1989–2001), a massive steel sculpture that spews fire.

His interest in machines also led him to create artworks using animal bones, bird wings, and skin. In his pieces, he combined elements from nature and human culture.

Cronhammar made his sculptures from materials like mahogany, steel, and rubber. They can be found in museums and public spaces in Denmark. The Herning Museum of Contemporary Art has a big collection of his works.

Ingvar Cronhammar died on May 20, 2021, at the age of 73. 

In 1993, Cronhammar was awarded the Eckersberg Medal. In 2003, he was awarded Thorvaldsen Medal. He was decorated a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog in 2007. 

Environmental art

Environmental art is a form of avant-garde contemporary art. It includes different types of artistic practices that involve nature, ecology, and social issues.

It has changed over time, moving away from focusing on formal aspects, like using earth for large sculptures, and now explores deeper connections with natural systems, processes, and social concerns.

In recent years, environmental art has gained significant attention and is often featured in exhibitions worldwide. This is because social and cultural aspects of climate change became more noticeable.

The term "environmental art" is often associated with ecological concerns, but it is not limited to them. It primarily celebrates the artist's relationship with nature and often use natural materials. It is closely related to historical earth and land art, as well as ecological art. Environmental artists draw inspiration from science and philosophy.

Environmental art has roots in the Paleolithic cave paintings of early humans, although landscapes have not been found in these artworks. Artists throughout history have been drawn to nature as a subject for their creative expressions. Landscape painting allowed artists to observe and connect with the environment. John Constable and Monet are artists who closely observed and represented the natural world in their works. In contemporary times, artists like Diane Burko and Alexis Rockman use art to highlight ecological issues such as climate change and human impact on other species. They bring attention to these topics through their depictions of nature and societal interventions.

Romer's tree frog

Romer's bubble-nest frog, Romer's Philautus, Romer's tree frog, or Romer's small tree frog ("Romerus romeri") is a frog. It lives in Hong Kong. Scientists have seen it between 0–650 meters above sea level.

The adult frog is 15 to 25 mm long from nose to rear end. It is the smallest frog in Hong Kong that was not brought by human beings from somewhere else. Male frogs have white places on the first two toes of each front foot. The skin of the frog's back is brown in color. There is a brown line between the eyes. It has an X-shaped mark on its back. There are dark marks on the back legs. The skin of the frog's belly is cream-white in color. Some reports say there are dark spots on the belly and others say there are no spots.

This frog is awake at night. This frog lives in forests, on farms, and in places in between forests and farms. This frog looks for slow-moving water to lay its eggs. It looks for water with no fish and almost no food in the water.

The government of Hong Kong calls this frog a Protected Wild Animal. In 1999, one of the places where the frog lives, Ngong Ping on Lantau Island, was named a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

There are fewer of this frog than there were. This is because human beings change the places where it lives, because human beings brought new frogs to Hong Kong, and because human beings brought new animals that want to eat this frog.

Eleaticism

Eleaticism was a way of thinking about the world that some ancient Greek people had. They lived in a place called Elea, which is now in Italy. They thought that everything that exists is really one thing, and that thing is called Being. Being does not change or move or have parts. It is always the same and always whole. They also thought that we can know Being by using our reason, not by looking at things or feeling them. They said that what we see and feel is not real, but only an illusion. Some of the most famous Eleatic thinkers were Parmenides, Zeno, and Melissus. They wrote poems and arguments to explain their ideas.

Eleaticism was a way of thinking that started in the 5th century BC in ancient Greece. It was named after a place called Elea, where some of the thinkers lived. Elea was a town in southern Italy, near the sea. The first and most famous Eleatic thinker was Parmenides. He wrote a poem about his ideas. He had two students, Zeno and Melissus, who also wrote about Eleaticism. They tried to support Parmenides’ ideas with different arguments. Eleaticism was different from other ways of thinking at that time. It challenged the ideas of people like Xenophanes, Heraclitus, and Pythagoras. Eleaticism also influenced later thinkers like Plato and Aristotle.

Eleaticism was based on the idea that there is only one thing that is real and true, and that is Being. Being is something that does not change, move, or have parts. It is always the same and always whole. Everything else that we see or feel is not real, but only an illusion. Eleaticism also said that we can know Being by using our reason, not by using our senses. Reason tells us what is true and clear, while senses tell us what is false and confusing. Eleaticism also said that Being, thought, and expression are the same thing. This means that what we think and say must be about Being, and nothing else.

Television Act 1954

The franchises started to be awarded in 1954 with the final franchise being awarded in 1961 and by 1962, all franchises were on air. The first advertisement on ITV was at 8:12pm on the 22nd September 1955. The advertisement was for Gibbs SR toothpaste.

Francis Suarez 2024 presidential campaign

Francis X. Suarez, the 43rd Mayor of Miami, announced his campaign for the 2024 United States presidential election in a campaign video on June 14, 2023.

In April 2021, Suarez was seen as a possible running-mate to potential 2024 presidential candidate Nikki Haley emerged. A report by "The Hill" in September 2021 showed that Suarez was interested in running for president.

The bot directs users to campaign videos based on the questions asked, and can even make fun of other presidential candidates such as Ron DeSantis. The program is an example of artificial intelligence.

On August 8, Suarez announced that he had met the donor requirements to attend the first Republican primary debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

The campaign ended on August 29, 2023 after Suarez failed to qualify for the first debate.

On March 1, 2024, Suarez endorsed Donald Trump for the Republican nomination, citing Trump’s position on the border as the main reason.

Ahirwada

Ahirwada or Ahirwara is a historic town located between the Parvati and Betwa rivers in Central India or modern Madhya Pradesh. It was between the cities Bhilsa and Jhansi. It was named after Ahir warriors.

The Abhiras (modern day Ahirs) are often mentioned in Ksatrapa inscriptions of Saurashtra. The Puranas and the Brihatsamhita place the Abhiras in the southern region during the Samudragupta. These tribes slowly spread out in different parts of India. They may have occupied Ahirwada in Madhya Pradesh at a late date. We know of their occupation in Rajasthan also at a late date as is evident from the Jodhpur inscription of samwat 918, that the Abhira people of this area were a terror to their neighbours, because of their violent demeanour.

According to James Tod, The Princes of Garh Mandla, for ages continued the surname of Pal, which is indicative of their nomadic occupation. The Aheers, who occupied all the Central India and have left Aheerwara (Ahirwada) a memorial of their existence, was a bunch of the same race, as Aheer being a synonym for Pal.

Ahirwada is mentioned in "Malwa in Transition Or a Century of Anarchy: The First Phase, 1698-1765", along with "Khichiwada" and "Bhopal" where the anti Maratha feelings prevailed very often. Rising of the Ahirs of Ahirwada were a cause of worry for Maratha Supremacy as the Ahirs started building new Forts. Also, the presence of "Puranmal Ahir", an Ahir Ruler or chief of Ahir Country in Malwa is noticed in several historical accounts for the period of 1714 to 1716 .

Puranmal was an Ahir chief or leader of Malwa region during 1714-1716 (A.D.).
In 1714, Raja Jai Singh of Jaipur succeeded in suppressing the disorder in Malwa. The Afgan marauders established control over Sironj with the help of Ahir leader Puranmal. The Ahir country (Ahirwada) stood rebellion under its leader Puranmal, who closed the roads from Sironj to Kalabagh and from his strongholds of Ranod and Indore continued to trouble the government. Raja Jai Singh reached Sironj and defeated Afgan Army in April 1715. The peace so imposed could last no longer and in November 1715, Puranmal Ahir renewed his depredations in Malpur. The Rohilas, Girasias, Bhils, Ahirs and other Hindu princelins rose up in all the sides in Malwa. None of the efforts made by government could control the situation.


Ahirwada was a troubled region.Gopal Rao Barve suppressed them during the early months of 1761, buesoon after his departure the Ahirs rose again in alliance with Izzat Khan and the Khichis. Nothing could be done during the rainy season.

In November, 1761, Maratha officers in Ahirwada invited Malhar to come to their assistance. He came as far as Sanganer (February, 1762), but his wound prevented him from advancing to the scene of action. In December, 1761,Vishwas Rao was asked by his father, Naro Shankar, to capture Jhansi with the co-operation of Izzat Khan and Govind Kalyan.The latter was asked by the Poona Government to settle the Sarkar.

Peshwa Madhav Rao affairs of Ahirwada and to recover the fore of Bhilsa. seized by the Nawab of Bhopal.1During the years 1762-1764 the Marathas could pay noattention to the affairs of Malwa, Bundelkhand and Rajputana.The invasion of Nizam Ali and the civil war between the Peshwa and his uncle absorbed their energy. Malhar Rao, gradually sinking due to old age and ill-health, could not venture intothe scene of his former triumphs. Mahadji Sindhia was busy with the question of succession, and the Poona Government asyet showed no desire to profit by his abilities.

"Inactivity and lack of a vigorous policy weakened the Maratha power inMalwa".Two incidents seem to show that by the year 1764 dieposition of the Marathas in Northern India had somewhat improved. Ahmed Shah Abdali ratified a formal peace withthem in that year.' This was a much-needed relief, and at thesame time it was an indirect recognition of their still surviving power. The second incident is more interesting. We read in dieEast India Company's general letter to Madras, dated May 13,1768, "When our servants after the Battle of Buxur planned theextirpation of Shuja from his dominions and the giving thesame up to the King," Lord Clive soon discerned the Kingwould have been unable to maintain them and that it wouldhave destroyed the strongest barrier against the Marathas and1 S.P.D., xix, 12, 22, 37, 43; xxxix, 3.

Ahir Kingdom

The Ahir (Abhira) Kingdom in the Mahabharata is one of two kingdoms near the Sarasvati River which existed only as a dried up river bed during the time of the Kurukshetra War. They were dominated by the Ahirs/Abhiras sometimes referred to as Sur-abhira also, combining both Sura and Abhira kingdoms. The modern day Ahir/Abhira territory lies within the Northern areas of Gujarat and Southern Rajasthan, India.
Ahirs are mentioned as warriors in support of Duryodhana in the Mahabharat war. The Gopas, whom Krishna had offered to Duryodhana to fight in his support when he himself joined Arjuna's side, were no other than the Yadavas themselves, who were also the Ahirs. The Ahirs also have been described as Vratya Kshatriyas. The Ahirs are said to have looted the troops of Arjuna, the Pandava, when he was returning from Dwaraka being accompanied by some of the members of Sri Krishna's family after the death of the later. Abhiras are said to have waylaid Arjuna and deprived him of remaining wealth from Dwarka and women somewhere in Punjab. In Mahabharat Ahir, Gopa, Gopal and Yadavas are all synonyms. They defeated the hero of Mahabharat war, and did spare him when he disclosed the identity of the members of the family of Sri Krishna.
The Ahirs ruled Western Maharashtra which included Nasik, Aparanta, Lata and Khandesh.

According to historian Sudhakar Chattopadhyaya the Ahir Kingdom (Ay Dynasty) was far more extended in South India.

Porus was an ancient Indian king whose territory spanned the region between the Hydaspes River of Jhelum and Acesines (Chenab River), in the Punjab region. He is credited to have been a legendary warrior with exceptional skills.Porus fought against Alexander the Great in the Battle of the Hydaspes (326 BC), thought to be fought at the site of modern-day Mong, Punjab, which is now part of Pakistan. Ancient Greek historians describe the battle and the aftermath of Alexander's victory. After the defeat and arrest of Porus in the war, Alexander asked Porus how he would like to be treated. Porus, although defeated, being a valiant, proud king, stated that he be treated like how Alexander himself would expect to be treated. Alexander was reportedly so impressed by his adversary that he not only reinstated him as a satrap of his own kingdom but also granted him dominion over lands to the south-east extending until the Hyphasis (Beas).Porus reportedly died sometime between 321 and 315 BC.

According to historian Ishwari Prasad, Porus might have been a Yaduvanshi Shurasena. He argued that Porus' vanguard soldiers carried a banner of Heracles whom Megasthenes—who travelled to India after Porus had been supplanted by Chandragupta—explicitly identified with the Shurasenas of Mathura. This Heracles of Megasthenes and Arrian (the so called Megasthenes' Herakles) has been identified by some scholars as Krishna and by others as his elder brother Baladeva, who were both the ancestors and patron deities of Shoorsainis Yaduvansh.
Iswhari Prashad and others, following his lead, found further support of this conclusion in the fact that a section of Shurasenas were supposed to have migrated westwards to Punjab and modern Afghanistan from Mathura and
Dvārakā, after Krishna walked to heaven and had established new kingdoms there.

The Early Kalachuris or Kalachuris of Mahismati were generally classified as of Abhira lineage. As the Kalachuri-Era was started by Abhira king Ishwardutta/Ishwarsena and the Early Kalachuris were also closely connected with the Abhira-Traikutakas, who claimed to be the Yadavas of Haihaya sect. The Later Kalachuris were regarded as namesakes and they had no connection with the Early Kalachuris.

The following are the known rulers of the Kalachuri dynasty of Mahismati with their estimated reigns (IAST names in brackets):

• Krishnaraja (Kṛṣṇarāja), r. c. 550-575 CE

• Shankaragana (Śaṃkaragaṇa), r. c. 575-600 CE

• Buddharaja (Buddharāja), r. c. 600-625 CE

It is generally believed that Traikutakas were another class of Abhiras. And that is why they also have been called Abhira-Traikutaka in history. Indradutta, Dahrasena and Vyaghrasena are the chief kings of this dynasty. The Traikutakas are known for their Vaishnava sect, who claimed to be the Yadavas of the Haihaya lineage. And Dahrasena also performed Ashwamedh Yajna. The following were the principal rulers:


The Chudasama Dynasty is originally considered to be of Abhira lineage of Sindh. Graharipu of this lineage has been called as Abhira and Yadava in the poetry of Hemachandracharya. According to Indian historian Vidarbha Singh, Chudasama people are the descendants of Samma-Yadavas of the Nagar Samachi of Sindh, who probably migrated from Sindh in the 9th century. Harald Tambs-Lyche believes that the popular story evidence based on the poetry that was Chudasama Dynasty in Junagadh that is in Saurashtra (Sorath) region of Gujarat. The Chudasama line of Abhiras was traditionally established in 875 CE. Chudasama rulers were also often addressed by titles like 'Ahir Rana or Abhira Ranaka' and by the idea of ​​Harald Tambs-Lyche "Chudasama state was composed of Ahir caste and many small princely (petty) states which were later classified into Rajputs." Dulmaka Chudasama, the last ruler of this lineage, accepted Islam religion under the influence of Muhhamed Baghara in 1470. Baghara had invaded Girnar of Chudasama Dynasty many times.

Pantsing

Pantsing is pulling down someone else’s pants and sometimes their underwear without them wanting it. It is sometimes a prank and sometimes bullying.

In colleges in the United States before World War Two it was extremely common for male sophomores to pants male freshmen. Pantsing was also used in fraternity hazing. In 1971, the journalist Gail Sheehy said that it happened a lot to girls in elementary school and that it was actually sexual assault. 
Pantsing is also called debagging in England, dacking in Australia, breeking in Scotland, down-trou in New Zealand, and jocking in Ireland. It’s also sometimes called sharking but only when it’s used for sexual assault.

Another prank that is like this one is giving someone a wedgie where the underwear is pulled up instead of down. 

Pantsing is sometimes used by kids who are bullying other children. In 1996, a woman named Juanita Ross Epp wrote a book saying that teachers who didn’t have a problem with their students pantsing other students were doing a bad job because pantsing was bullying. 

In The Simpsons, the nerdy character Martin Prince wears a lot of different bathing suits at the same time when swimming in a pool since he knows Bart Simpson will pull them down but then so many other people pull them down that Martin ends up naked.

In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry is upset when he finds out that when his dead father James Potter was 15, he was a bully to Severus Snape who would use magic to take off Snape’s trousers and maybe his underwear in front of a lot of people and also made him eat soap.

The Laos-China Railway is a 414-kilometer railway line that connects the capital city of Laos, Vientiane, to the Chinese border. 

It is part of China's Belt and Road Initiative. It is expected to help economic development in Laos. It may improve transport of goods between Laos and China. The railway project began in 2016 and was opened in 2021. The line runs between Boten, on the Chinese border and Vientiane. As of 2023 there are no passenger services across the border. As to freight: In the first two and a half months of operation, about 500.000 t of goods were transported, about 100.000 t were transported across the border. 
Laos is a poor country. It paid 30% of the construction costs. China paid the remaining (70%). This debt accounts for about 80% of Laos' Gross domestic product. Estimates are that the interest for the Chinese loan make up about 20% of Laos' yearly expenses.

Digital euro

A Digital Euro, is the project of the European Central Bank (ECB) to plan and possibly introduce of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). 

The aim of the project is to develop a fast and secure digital currency bound to the Euro. Individuals and businesses could use it additionally to Euro in cash and in bank accounts, and would be issued by the European System of Central Banks of the Eurozone. The study phase will run from October 2021 to October 2023 and will prepare a decision on the introduction. 

Arguments and motives for the introduction of a digital euro are, according to the ECB:

In addition to these motives, the possibility of a further decline in the use of cash as a means of payment plays a role in the discussion on the digital euro.

On October 2, 2020, the ECB published a report outlining the introduction of a digital euro from the perspective of the Eurosystem.
Since 2020, several projects have been launched in collaboration with the European Investment Bank (EIB) to test the issuance, control and transfer of central bank digital currency, as well as securities tokens and smart contracts on a blockchain.

Following preliminary planning and the presentation of the results of a public consultation in early 2021, the ECB decided in July 2021 to launch a digital euro project to prepare for the possible introduction of a digital euro. No technical barriers were identified during the preliminary planning. The research, which is scheduled to run until autumn 2023, aims to shed light on the distribution to merchants and citizens, the impact on markets and the necessary European legislation. No preliminary decision has therefore been taken on the introduction of the digital euro.

In September 2022, the ECB announces a collaboration with five companies (Amazon, CaixaBank, Worldline, EPI and Nexi) to develop potential user interfaces for the digital euro.

Burkhard Balz, a member of the Bundesbank's Executive Board, sees the digital euro not least as a means of strengthening European sovereignty in payments. In his view, the digital euro could be designed to support programmable payments in a highly automated environment.

The first progress report on the investigation phase ("Progress on the investigation phase of a digital euro") was published by the ECB in September 2022.

Speaking at the conference "Towards a legislative framework enabling a digital euro for citizens and businesses" held in Brussels in early November 2022, Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, reiterated that the digital euro is not a stand-alone project limited to the area of payments. Rather, it is a cross-policy and truly European initiative that has the potential to have an impact on society as a whole.

In December 2022, the ECB published the second progress report on the investigation phase.

In January 2023, the ECB invited experts in the field of payments/finance to express their interest in contributing to the development of a set of rules for the digital euro.

At the end of May 2023, the ECB published the results of a market research and prototyping project. The market research had shown that there was a sufficiently large pool of European vendors capable of developing digital euro solutions. It had also shown that different types of architectural and technological design options were available to develop a technical solution for a digital euro. The prototyping project involved the integration of five user interfaces developed by different vendors for each use case (front-end prototypes) and a settlement system designed and developed by the Eurosystem (back-end prototype). Different design options were tested to determine whether they could be technically implemented and integrated into the Eurosystem's settlement system. The tests showed that it would be possible to integrate a digital euro smoothly into the existing payment landscape, while leaving room for the market to use innovative features and technologies in the dissemination of a digital euro. The results also confirmed that, in principle, a digital euro could function both online and offline using different technical concepts. The question remains whether an offline solution that meets the Eurosystem's requirements and achieves the necessary scale can be implemented in the short to medium term using existing technology.

The Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband (Public German Consumer Protection Organisation) sees the digital euro as a public good and thus an opportunity to make digital payments more consumer-oriented.

The German Informatics Society (GI) sees the introduction of a digital euro and the simultaneous decline of cash as a threat to informational self-determination and privacy; there is a danger of the "Gläsnerer Mensch" (German metaphor for data protection, representing the complete "screening" of people and their behavior by a monitoring state, which is perceived as negative).

From the perspective of the German Banking Industry Committee, the global trend toward central bank digital currency is unmistakable and represents both an opportunity and a challenge. The planned introduction of a digital euro is seen as an important contribution to the digitalization of the economy and society and to securing Europe's sovereignty and competitiveness. The digital money ecosystem proposed in a policy paper is intended to go beyond digital cash and consists of three elements:

The Association of German Banks supports the introduction of a digital euro. In a position paper published in February 2023, the private banks emphasize the evolution of cash, their role in its issuance, its openness to innovation, and their desire to minimize the risks of its introduction. Among the risks, the private banks specifically mention those affecting their business (disintermediation, diminishing returns, weakening of their customer relationship) and that a weakening of their investment capabilities could lead to the failure of the digital euro.

The Bundesverband der Deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BdV) welcomes the ECB's plans for a digital euro, but criticizes that the needs of the economy for a future digital payment method have not yet been sufficiently taken into account.

In a position paper published at the end of September 2022, the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI, Federation of German Industries) warns that the needs of the industry must be taken into account when introducing a digital euro. The programmability of payments is a key demand. of payments is a central requirement. 

For Paschal Donohoe, president of the Eurogroup, a body of finance ministers from euro member states, the digital euro project is about maintaining the link between citizens and central bank money: as central bank money, the digital euro would be convertible one-to-one into euro banknotes.

Unlike the industry, the Eurogroup does not want the digital euro to be equipped with additional functions.

In June 2023, the European Commission proposed in a draft regulation on the introduction of the digital euro that a digital euro should be made available as a legal tender not only to banks, but above all to the general public. The Commission wants to design the processing of digital euro transactions in such a way that neither the European Central Bank nor the national central banks can attribute data to an identified or identifiable digital euro user.

Chimo (music)

Chimo (Marxa mora, march of the Moors) is a march and an integral part of the fiestas Moros i Cristians in Ontinyent, for which it is considered a kind of anthem. It was composed especially for this purpose by José María Ferrero Pastor in 1964 and is also used in the performance of Moros i Cristians in other places.

The composition was considered a significant enrichment of the fiestas and was appreciated in Spanish, Moroccan and Arabic media. With this particular melody, Ferrero gave a romantic, medieval, Arabic framework to the historical conflicts between Moors and Christians in the Iberian Peninsula.

The work has been recorded several times by the Societat Unió Artística Musical d'Ontinyent, whose director José María Ferrero was pastor for 37 years until his tragic death in 1987.

Uzbekistan State World Languages University

Uzbekistan State University of World Languages (abbreviated as UzSWLU, Uzbek: Oʻzbekiston davlat jahon tillari universiteti; abbreviated as OʻzDJTU) is a public university in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Islam Karimov established this university by merging two language institutions in 1992.

The University has 7 faculties: Roman & German Philology, Journalism, Translation Studies, Russian Philology and three English faculties and offers bachelor and master degrees in language-related fields.

It has also the main national responsibility for training and requalification ESL teachers, creating and updating language textbooks, teaching methods, strategies in Uzbekistan. The University also has its own printing service and coordinates the Centre for Development of Language Teaching Methods.

UzSWLU is relatively young institution, established by Islam Karimov, former Uzbekistan's President. In its current form, It was created in 1992 by the merger of two higher institutes in Tashkent as follows:


In 2007, the University established a lyceum that prepares middle school students to enter the University and also teaches language and humanitarian subjects in depth. Prior to this 2017, the University contained three lyceums, but with the introduction of an eleven-year educational school, this number was reduced to one. This lyceum is on Bobur Street in Tashkent.

UzSWLU mainly focuses on language-related fields and it's divided into these 7 faculties:
The University has three English faculties but they cover different fields, for example, the first faculty is aimed at training interpreters.

This faculty was firstly established on 12 May 1992 by President Karimov.

The history of the faculty is directly linked to the history of the university as it was opened in the same year with the establishment of the university. This faculty actually trains ESL teachers and also gives them a choice to learn second language.

The list of the second languages which are taught are given as follows, and the student can choose which language to learn: French, German, Arab, Spanish, Turkish and Chinese.

It also cooperates with some international companies and institutions. The partners of the faculty are given as follows: British Council in Uzbekistan, American Embassy in Uzbekistan, "ITEC" program of Indian Embassy, educational program of Malaysian Embassy in Uzbekistan and with the "TEMPUS" program of European Union. There are three main departments which are currently located at the faculty, and they are: "English language phonetics and phonology department", "English language grammar and history department", "Professional lexica department". This is the oldest faculty in this university.

The second faculty shares the same structure and serves the similar purposes as the faculty. However, the main differences between the faculties could be found.

It's one of the youngest faculties that was created after splitting the first English faculty in 2002. It was granted a special status in 2009 so now it's fully independent college that is working . Nowadays, there are about 1461 students who are currently involved with the studies at the faculty.

There's more than 100 lecturers and teachers and more 61 of them have or hold a doctor degree. The faculty offers the right to choose one course as the second language, rather than English. There are four main departments at the faculty, which are given as follows: "Practical subjects on English language", "Lexicology of English language", "Stylistics of English language" and "Natural subjects".

The third one is the same with its structure and the educational materials with its two ancestors, that's mentioned before.

This faculty is also considered to be the youngest English language related faculty of the University,

as it was first established by the Decree of the President of Republic of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov number PD-1875 on the topic of "Developing the systems of learning foreign languages" in the year of 2012 on 10 December, and by the Edict of President of Republic of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov number PD-1971 on the topic of "Developing the "Uzbekistan State University of World Languages"", in the year of 2013 on 23 May.

Nowadays, there are about 1204 students who are involved with the studies at the "Third English language faculty", and in a short period of time the faculty became very famous among the young generation of Uzbekistan, as it gives essential practical and theoretical knowledge about the English language.

The students can obtain the bachelor's degree from the faculty, from the following branches which are: "Teaching of philology and foreign languages (English language)" and "Foreign language and its literature (English language)".

Students can obtain their master's degree from the faculty, by the branches which are given as follows: "English language" and "Literature" (English literature). There are three main departments at the "Third English language faculty" and they are given as follows:

Roman and German philology faculty was opened in 2013 by consolidation all non-English departments that focus on German, French and Spanish.

There are 805 students who are currently involved with the studies at the "Roman-German philology faculty", and there are more than 100 teachers at the faculty. Most of the teachers have their scientific degrees on their related subjects and languages, and 58 of them are considered as the professors.

This is a well-known faculty that fulfils the demand of Russian specialists and Russian teachers in Uzbekistan since there is a lot of Russian schools or students who would like to study subjects exclusively in Russian.

Opened in 1994, the faculty is not really popular among the applicants, however, the needs for the interpreters in Uzbekistan grow year by year.

They teach English, French, Spanish and German to their students and master's degree programme was opened in 2005. The sponsors of the faculty are given as follows: Moscow State Language University, Perudja University (Italy), Beijing Chinese language and Culture Institute, Seoul Chun Ang University, KOICA, Deli University (India), JICA International Corporation (Japan), British Council in Uzbekistan and many other institutions.

There are 6 main departments which are currently located at the faculty, and they are given as follows:

Nearly, all of the higher educational institutions of Uzbekistan are linked with the academic lyceums and the colleges that prepare some students for them. There's actually a lyceum that was opened in 2007 and now located on Bobur Str.

The lyceum enrols only the students who have finished their middle school and then successfully passed the admission tests.

Currently, this lyceum has three faculties: Foreign Languages, Humanities and Natural Sciences. Each department has its own curriculum and specialized subjects, for example, the faculty of foreign languages is exclusively engaged in teaching English at the intermediate and higher levels and the humanities department focuses only on history and related subjects; the main goal of the lyceum is to prepare a graduate with a sufficient level of knowledge for the university.

Braak Base Line

The Braak Base Line was the baseline for the state survey of the Duchy of Holstein, the Danish state, the city of Hamburg and the Kingdom of Hanover (Gaussian state survey). Its length was measured in 1820/21 by Heinrich Christian Schumacher between the two trigonometric points near Braak in the district of today's Brunsbek in the district of Langelohe and Ahrensburg. After the reduction by Christian August Friedrich Peters in 1853, the length was determined to be 3,014.45115 toises (5,875.2747 meters).

For the Danish survey, a route in a flat area was chosen:


Observing the points from the Michaeliskirche in Hamburg and the Friedenskirche in Siek, which later burned down, resulted in the first major side of the triangle for the Danish and Hanoverian triangulation.

The points are still preserved but difficult to reach. The formerly open plain between the base points is now developed with the village of Braak, the federal highway 1, the industrial area of Stapelfeld/Braak and the residential area at the southern end of Ahrensburg.

Heinrich Christian Schumacher had a good relationship with the Danish King Friedrich VI., which enabled him to set up the observatory in Altona near Hamburg, which was then in Denmark. His teacher in Göttingen was Carl Friedrich Gauss . So Schumacher initiated the Danish king's request to the Hanoverians to let Gauss participate in the measurement of the baseline. Both were on location from 12. September to 25. October 1820 to combine the surveys of both kingdoms across the Elbe river. Gauss was thus able to forego his own length measurement.

Schumacher and Gauss were also in close contact with Johann Georg Repsold . Schumacher used a base measuring device of his friend Repsold to measure the base. Repsold also made important contributions to the determination of the Altona meridian and the meridian circle of the Göttingen Observatory (distance 7.5 toises or 14.618 meters) in the form of his excellent instruments and improvements to existing instruments.

FRACTRAN

Fractran is a simple programming language invented by mathematician John Horton Conway. It operates on fractions and uses them as instructions for the program.

In Fractran, you start with a positive whole number as the input. The program consists of a list of fractions. You multiply the input by each fraction in the list, one after another. The result of each multiplication is rounded down to the nearest whole number, and that becomes the new input for the next iteration.

The process continues until the input can no longer be multiplied by any of the fractions in the list. At that point, the program stops, and the final output is the last number you obtained.

What makes Fractran interesting is that some programs can do really powerful things. For example, they can simulate any other computer program, given the right set of fractions. These programs are like universal computers in a simple language.

The behavior of Fractran programs is related to the prime factorization of numbers. The fractions in the program are carefully chosen to produce specific patterns or sequences. This connection to number theory makes Fractran a fascinating area of study for mathematicians and computer scientists.

Overall, Fractran is a simple language where you multiply an input by fractions repeatedly until you can't do it anymore, and the final result is your output. But within this simplicity lies the potential for powerful computation and deep mathematical connections.

Dragon Pilot: Hisone and Masotan

Hisone Amakasu is a rookie in the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, where she is situated at the Gifu air base. She decided to join the force to distance herself from people as, her whole life, she had found it difficult to interact with others due to her candid style of speaking and oftentimes hurtful words, despite that not being her intention. Hisone's decision leads to her life being changed when the concealed "OTF" - Organic Transformed Flyer, or dragon - inside the base chooses her to be his pilot, leading her to discover her destined role as a dragon pilot during their ascension in the skies together. According to legend, dragons are thought to possess a key to unlocking the future of the world.



The dragons used as OTFs by the JASDF are habitually dressed in transforming armor shaped like military planes to avoid drawing public attention. In order to be flown, the dragons swallow their pilots, who then steer them from within their stomachs via a naturally activated holographic display control system. To protect themselves from the dragons' digestive juices, each pilot is required to wear a special acid-resistant suit. In addition, a D-Pilot must reserve her feelings exclusively for her personal OTF; if she establishes a love relationship with someone else, the bond between them is broken (this event is commonly referred to as "anastomosis").

The opening theme song titled is composed by Taisei Iwasaki and performed by Riko Fukumoto, featuring lyrics written by Mari Okada. The ending theme song titled is a cover of France Gall's "Le temps de la rentrée," arranged by Iwasaki and performed by D-Pai (D-Pilots, short for "dragon pilots"), a vocal unit comprising voice actresses Misaki Kuno, Tomoyo Kurosawa, Maki Kawase, Satomi Arai and Kaori Nazuka.

Pinwheel Twist

Pinwheel Twist is an unreleased lost song written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney before their pop group The Beatles became famous. The song was listed for recording in 1962 at EMI studio, but the list was trimmed down and the song became obscure after that.

The song was improvised on March 22 1962 by Paul McCartney, who was influenced by the "twist" craze of the early sixties. He would perform it later that evening. The audience response was mediocre, but nonetheless he pawned it off on then-drummer Pete Best, who sang lead while McCartney worked the drums. The song was drawn up on a list of 30 songs for a recording session at EMI, but got cut at the last minute. During the various Best performances, the Beatles had changed from leather jackets into "Beno Dorn" suits and ties, and accompanied it with the Starlighter's hit, "Peppermint Twist".
Pete Best has since recalled the main lines of the song, ""Pinwheel twist going round and round / Pinwheel twist going round and round / Pinwheel twist going round and round / Hey, pinwheel twist"".

Later, Beatles scholar Mark Lewisohn, while researching information on his book, unearthed further lyrics, ""We’ll twist, we’ll pinwheel / Do the spin wheel / Right away, night and day, [at this point, Paul calls out: ‘two-three’] / Well come on everybody and do the shimmy-shimmy / While you’re dancing to and fro – like this! / Everybody’s doing the Pinwheel Twist."" The song also in known to have a "congruous waltz" section in the middle.

Wales West and North Television

Wales (West and North) Television seen by viewers as Teledu Cymru and often called WWN was ITV franchise for North and West Wales. It was the first ITV station to lose its franchise. The name Teledu Cymru that was seen on screens was Welsh for Television Wales. The station was awarded the franchise on the 6 June 1961. WWN started broadcasting on 14 September 1962 and ended on 26 January 1964. The station ended broadcasting due to financial failure.After the failure of WWN, the franchise region was merged with South Wales and the West, served by TWW (Television Wales and the West) but the name Teledu Cymru would be used in the former region. On 20 May 1968, the Teledu Cymru name was dropped, due to Harlech taking over the franchise. 

The geography of Wales was a problem for the Independent Television Authority (ITA). The more inhabited South was already served by Television Wales and the West, which started in 1958, while the north east and a lot of the north coast was served by Granada and ABC, started in 1956. The central regions of north wales couldn't obtain ITV programmes.

The ITA was pressured by a group of Welsh-speaking businessmen to setup a North and West Wales region. The ITA asked the Postmaster General to allow it, which he did with conditions. 

The conditions were:
These conditions were accepted by the ITA. On 6 June 1961, the contract was given to Wales Television Limited. The name was changed to Wales (West and North) Television Limited following opposition from TWW.

The station was to use three VHF transmitters, Preseli (for the south west), Arfon (for the north west) and Moel-y-Parc (for the north east). The Preseli station was finished in 14 September 1962. WWN launched the same day as the Preseli transmitter, becoming the last original ITV station to start broadcasting. The Arfon and Moel-y-parc transmitters were delayed until later 1963, causing damage to workers morale and WWN's profits. The free programming from the ITV network, plus support from their neighbours, ABC, ATV and TWW were able to barely keep the station up and running. The fatal problem was when Granada Television stopped production of all Welsh programming, stopping an important stream of money to WWN. In May 1963, WWN stopped production of local programming and turned their studio into a master control station until they could find a successor to WWN.

2023 FIFA Women's World Cup final

The 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup Final was a football game that decided the winner of the tournament. It happened on August 20, 2023, at Stadium Australia in Sydney, Australia. The teams playing were Spain and England. A total of 75,784 fans were in the stadium to watch, and the referee was Tori Penso from the United States.

Both Spain and England were in their first-ever Women's World Cup final. They wanted to achieve a rare feat by winning both the men's and women's World Cups, something only Germany had done before in 2003. Also, they wanted to be the first team from Europe to win the tournament since Germany in 2007. This was the third time in the Women's World Cup history that two European teams faced each other in the final. In the past, new champions emerged in these matches.

Spain won the final with a score of 1-0. Olga Carmona scored the only goal, and Mariona Caldentey assisted her. Spain not only became the second country to win both the men's and women's World Cups, but they also achieved another remarkable milestone by holding all three World Cups of the same gender (senior, U-20, and U-17) at the same time, following in the footsteps of Brazil's male teams between 2003 and 2005.

Both teams, Spain and England, were making their Women's World Cup final debut. Spain had participated in two previous Women's World Cups, reaching the round of 16 in 2019, while England had a more extensive history, having played in five previous World Cups, with their best performance in 2015 when they finished number three. This final marked the third all-European final in Women's World Cup history, following 1995 when Norway won against Germany in Stockholm — and 2003 when Germany won against Sweden and won their first title to become the first country to have won both senior World Cups; at the time, their men's team had won three world titles. The 2023 final's winner would be the first European team to win since Germany in 2007 and the first new champion since Japan in 2011. In their previous 17 meetings, England had the upper hand with seven wins, while Spain had three victories, and six matches ended in draws, including the ones at the UEFA Women's Championship. 

Spain's coach, Jorge Vilda, was managing in his fourth major championship in a row, becoming the first man to lead a Women's World Cup-winning side since Norio Sasaki with Japan in 2011 and the first European man since Even Pellerud in 1995 to achieve this. England's manager, Sarina Wiegman, was in her fourth big tournament. She won the 2017 Euros, came second in the 2019 Women's World Cup with the Netherlands, and won the Women's Euro 2022 with England. She made history by leading different nations in multiple men's or women's World Cup finals and sought to become the first manager to win the tournament with a foreign national team. Unfortunately, she lost, becoming the first manager to lose two successive World Cup finals.

Spain qualified for a big women's tournament in 1997 and reached the semi-finals in their first European Championship. They also made it to their first Women's World Cup in 2015. Their best result in the Women's World Cup before was getting to the round of 16 in 2019. Before the tournament started, Spain was ranked sixth in the FIFA Women's World Ranking. They were in group C with Costa Rica, Zambia, and 2011 champions Japan. In their first game of the World Cup against Costa Rica, there was an own goal from Costa Rican player Valeria del Campo. Then, Aitana Bonmatí and Esther González scored two more goals in four minutes, and Spain won 3–0. In their next game, Spain beat Zambia 5–0, with Teresa Abelleira scoring the opening goal in the ninth minute. Alba Redondo and Jennifer Hermoso also scored goals, and it was Jennifer Hermoso's 100th match. In the last group game against Japan, Spain lost 4–0, with two goals from Hinata Miyazawa. In the round of 16, Spain played against Switzerland, who won Group A. Aitana Bonmatí scored first, but then there was an own goal from Laia Codina that gave Switzerland a goal. Spain then scored three more goals in the first half to lead 4–1 at halftime. In the second half, Spain scored one more goal, and the match ended 5–1. In the quarter-finals, Spain played against the Netherlands. Mariona Caldentey scored from a penalty in the 81st minute to give Spain the lead.

They also qualified for the Women's World Cup for the first time in 1995. The best they had done in the tournament before was coming in third place in 2015. Before the tournament, the Lionesses had achieved some important victories. They won their first big trophy at the Women's Euro 2022, which they hosted. They also beat Brazil, who had won the Copa América Femenina, in the first ever Women's Finalissima match, played at Wembley. Under manager Sarina Wiegman, they had only lost one match, which was a friendly against Australia. They were ranked fourth in the FIFA Women's World Ranking.

Ella Toone scored first for England, but Australia equalised through Sam Kerr. Lauren Hemp and Alessia Russo scored to help England reach their first Women's World Cup final.

The game was described as exciting, with Spain having more clear chances to score towards the end. At the beginning, England played energetically and Spain was patient. The first shot happened in the 5th minute when England's Lauren Hemp kicked the ball at Spain's goalkeeper, Cata Coll. Spain then attacked and sent a cross into the box, but it didn't result in a goal. England had some good opportunities too, especially with passes to their forward Alessia Russo. In the 16th minute, Hemp had a great chance to score but hit the crossbar.

The match got more intense when Spain attacked and forced England's goalkeeper Mary Earps to make a quick save. Both teams had chances over the next few minutes. In the 23rd minute, a person ran onto the field and interrupted the game briefly. Spain got the ball back but their counterattack didn't work. Then, Spain's Olga Carmona scored a goal in the 29th minute after taking a shot that went between the goalkeeper and the post. Spain's goal came from a fast attack, not from their usual possession style. After this, England struggled and Spain had more chances to score.

In the second half, England changed their formation and brought in new players. They tried to defend better and create more opportunities, but they faced challenges. Spain got a penalty kick, but their shot was saved by England's goalkeeper. The game had some pauses due to injuries and video reviews.

Match rules

Spain has become the second country to win both the men's and women's World Cups. They're also the second country, after Brazil's male teams in 2003-2005, to hold all three World Cups of the same gender (senior, under-20, and under-17) at the same time. Salma Paralluelo is the first player, regardless of gender, to win all three World Cups in the same category. 

In a match, Spain's captain and goalscorer, Olga Carmona, was named the best player. After scoring, she lifted her shirt to show an undershirt with "Merchi" written on it, which was the name of her friend's mother who had recently died. In the press room after the match, she dedicated the victory to her. Sadly, she was informed shortly after that her own father had also died before the match.

The Spain team took an overnight flight back to Madrid for a public celebration on the evening of 21st August, which was held at Madrid Río park and attended by several thousand people. The victory of the team was prominently featured on the front pages of newspapers on 21st August with strong headlines. The England team stayed overnight in Sydney before returning to London, and they are set to arrive on 22nd August. The Women's Super League won't begin its season until October. Keir Starmer, the UK Leader of the Opposition, has called for the team to be honoured for reaching a World Cup final, something that has happened before in men's sports. The match was also featured on the front pages of all British newspapers on 21st August, mostly showing images of the team looking disappointed, with headlines expressing pride at reaching the final.

During the ceremony where medals were given out, the president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), Luis Rubiales, kissed Jennifer Hermoso on the lips, even though she clearly didn't like it. This action was criticized, especially because it highlighted the ongoing issue of sexism in sports, and many people called for Rubiales to step down from his position. In a different situation at the end of the game, Rubiales was caught on camera pointing at the Spanish players and making an inappropriate gesture by grabbing his private area. This rude gesture received further criticism because he was standing next to Infanta Sofía, a teenage member of the Spanish royal family. After Hermoso expressed that she didn't expect or appreciate the kiss, Rubiales went into the players' changing room. He reportedly put his arm around Hermoso and made a joke about marrying her in Ibiza.

Later, while on a layover on his way back from Australia, Rubiales posted a video in which he apologized. He said he didn't have bad intentions and was sorry for taking attention away from the celebration. He mentioned that being the president requires being more careful. Rubiales faced a lot of criticism for his actions, and many people, including various Spanish football organizations and the government, called for him to resign. He and the national team coach, Vilda, tried to get Hermoso to support Rubiales by issuing a fake statement when she wouldn't. However, Hermoso released a statement through her union, Futpro, stating that the kiss was unacceptable, and they were working to see that it was appropriately addressed.

The RFEF scheduled an extraordinary general meeting for 25th August to discuss this matter.

Tanya Savicheva

Tatyana Nikolayevna Savicheva (Russian: Татья́на Никола́ыевна Са́вичева; 23 January 1930 – 1 July 1944) was a Soviet schoolgirl who during the Siege of Leningrad, used her notebook as a diary. Almost the entire family of Tanya Savicheva died during the siege from December 1941 to May 1942. Her diary consists of nine pages, six of which contains the death dates of her family members. Tanya died after evacuation on 1 July 1944, at the age of 14. Her hospital registration card stated that she suffered from scurvy, dystrophy, neurosis, blindness, and intestinal tuberculosis. Only her older sister Nina and her brother Mikahil had survived the siege, thanks to whom Tanya's diary has survived and has become one of the mournful symbols of the Great Patriotic War. During the 20th century, only excerpts of Tanya's diary were published. The diary was digitized in 2016, and exhibited at the Rumyantsev Mansion.

Tanya was born on 23 Janaury 1930 in the village of Dvorishchi near Gdov, not far from Lake Peipus, but, liker her brothers and sisters, she grew up in Leningrad (which is why Leningrad is often erroneously indicated as her birthplace). 

Tanya was the fifth and youngest child of Nikolai Rodionovich Savichev (1884 – 5 March 1936) and Maria Ignatievna Fedorova (1889 – 13 May 1942). She had two sisters named Evgenia (1909 – 28 December 1941) and Nina (23 November 1918 – 6 February 2013), and two brothers named Leonid "Lyoka" (1917 – 17 March 1942) and Mikhail (1921–1988). She also had two older sisters and a brother whom she never knew because they died in infancy from scarlet fever in 1916, before she was born.

Maria decided in advance that she would not give birth in Leningrad, and in the last month of her pregnancy, she went to Dvorishchi to her sister Kapitolina, whose husband was a doctor and helped Maria give birth. She returned to Leningrad with her infant daughter Tanya, being already a few months old. It is unknown exactly when Tanya was born, though three possible dates are known: 




Tanya's father, Nikolai, owned the Labor Artel of the Savichev brothers, opened by him in 1910 on the 2nd line of Vasilevsky Street in the Sovietskaya Street. Nikolai himself, Maria, and Nikolai's three brothers named Dmitry, Vasily, and Alexei, all worked in the bakery.

In the 1930's, Nikolai, who was a Nepman, became "a lishenet" and in 1935 the NKVD evicted the Savichevs from Leningrad, to put them on the 101st kilometer for the village of Borovichi, but after sometime the family were able to return to the city, however Nikolai fell ill in exile and died from cancer on 5 March 1936 at the age of 52. He was buried at the Smolensk Orthodox Cemetery not far from the chapel of Xenia the Blessed, where three of his other children were buried earlier in 1916. 

Being the children of a "deprived person" all five Savichevs could not join the Komsomol and were limited in their choice of higher education. By the beginning of the war, Nina and Evgenia worked together at the Nevsky Plant named after Lenin (Evgenia worked in the archive and Nina worked in the design bureau). Leonid served as planer at the Admiralty Shipyards. Misha graduated from factory school and worked as a fitter. Maria was a seamstress, and worked as a homeworker in the sewing company "May 1 Artel" and was considered as one of the best embroiders there. Leonid was fond of music and together with his friends formed an amateur string orchestra. They often held rehearsals in Leonid's apartment. The Savichevs had many musical instruments that included a piano, guitars, a banjo, a balalaika, and a mandolin. In their free time, the Savichevs organized home concerts. Leonid and Mikhail played the instruments, Maria and Tanya sang, and the rest kept on with the chorus. 

Nina and Misha remembered Tanya as "a very shy and not childishly serious girl". 

According to them, "Tanya was a golden girl. Inquisitive, with a easy and even character. She was very good at listening. We told her about everything. About work, about sports, about friends, etc." 

Tanya had a particularly good relationship with her uncle Vasily. He had a small library in his apartment, and Tanya asked him questions, mostly about life. They often took walks along the Neva.

According to the diaries, around forty boatmen worked under Merer. The diaries were discovered in 2013.

Merer was an Ancient Egyptian. 

The first years of Merer's life is completely obscure.

In his adulthood, Merer was a middle ranking official who held the title "inspector" ("sHD").
Merer and his crew worked by transporting white limestone blocks from Tura to Giza, which were then used to construct the Great Pyramid of Giza, which is documented in Merer's diary. 
Around forty boatmen worked under Merer. 

Later in his life, Merer works as a construction builder in the Nile Delta and is attempting to build a "double djadja" in the region. And even later than that, Merer works at the residence of Egyptian pharaoh Khufu. 

The last years of Merer's life are disputed.

The first and second diaries reveal that Merer and his crew work for several months transporting limestone from Tura to Giza in the 26th or 27th year of the reign of Egyptian pharaoh Khufu. About every ten days, two or three round trips were done, shipping approximately 30 blocks of 2—3 tonnes each, amounting to approximately 200 blocks per month. In the diaries, Merer mentions that he and his crew opened giant dykes to divert water from the Nile, channeling it into canals leading it into the Great Pyramid of Giza. Around forty boatmen worked under Merer. The period covered in the diaries spans a few months.

The entries in those two diaries are all arranged in the same line.
At the top of every entry is a heading naming the month and season. 
Under that there is a horizontal line listing the days of the months. Under the entries for the days, there are always two vertical columns describing what happened on these days (Section B II): "[Day 1] The director of 6 Idjeru casts for Heliopolis in a transport boat to bring us food from Heliopolis while the elite is in Tura", "Day 2 Inspector Merer spends the day with his troop hauling stones in Tura North; spending the night at Tura North." 

The diaries also mention the original name of the Great Pyramid of Giza: Akhet–Khufu (English: Horizon of Khufu). 

In addition to Merer and his crew, a few other people are mentioned in the two diaries. The most important one is Ankhhaf, a half-brother of Khufu. Ankhhaf is known from other Ancient Egyptian sources dating to around his time. It is highly speculated that Ankhaf was a prince and vizier under Khufu and/or Khafre. In the diaries, Merer mentions that Ankhhaf is a nobleman and a overseer of a ship harbor at Giza.
It is highly speculated that the limestone blocks used to build the Great Pyramid were transported to the harbor.

In the two diaries, Merer writes mostly about his work.

The third diary reveals that Merer is working as a construction builder in the Nile Delta and is attempting to build a "double djadja" in the region, at the time.

The fourth diary reveals that Merer is working at the residence and the (?) of Khufu, at the time.

Other diaries (5 and 6) and associated accounts (7 to 12 and other accounts) are in a state of severe putrefaction and their texts have yet to be translated and/or published.

In 2013, French archaeologists unearthed Merer's diaries during a excavation in a Ancient Egyptian man-made cave. 
The archaeologists unearthed six diaries and more than six associated accounts. All of the papyri had text written in the pages, as far as we know.
The original copy of the diaries are exhibited at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.

Grease duct

A grease duct is a duct that vents flammable vapors from commercial cooking equipment such as stoves and deep fryers to the outside of the building. It will normally be connected to an exhaust fan.

Vapors are created when grease is heated to and beyond its vaporization point. When it cools, the grease will condense on colder surfaces. Grease is a flammable hydrocarbon.

In many places, they will be constructed out of stainless-steel ductwork connected through a series of air filters which will be pulled by a fan and exhausted outside. They will also often have some form of fire damper in this ductwork connected to the fire alarm system. 

These systems must be cleaned sometimes. Many will have certificates issued by the cleaning and maintenance contractors.

Problems with hoods that are not taken care of include poor ventilation, excess heat and smoke, and the potential risk of fires.


Yadavs in Bihar

Yadavs in Bihar refers to the people of Yadav community of the Indian state of Bihar. They are also known as Ahir, Gope and Rai etc. The Yadavs form the single largest caste population in the state with more than 14.26% of the state's population, and are included in the Other Backward Class category.

The Yadavs claim to be descended from lord Krishna of ancient Yadu tribe.

According to Vishnu Purana, Abhiras (modern day Ahirs) conquered Magadha and regained there for several hundred years.

In Bihar, there were many zamindars belonging to the Ahir community. These zamindars belonged to the difficult geographical regions, mostly diara land of the rivers. In the diara regions their rule continued with the help of their militia. The Ahir zamindars were predominantly found in northern and eastern parts of Bihar.


At one time the main occupation of the Yadavs of Bihar was rearing cattle, but now most of them are cultivator. While majority of Yadavs were peasants with minor landholdings in the Northern and Central parts of India, a few Yadavs had taken over large tract of land in the newly reclaimed portion of Eastern Bihar (Purnea and Saharsa) and had become big landholders.

There are four main sub-castes of Yadav/Ahirs in Bihar, Kishnaut, Majhraut, Kannaujia or Kanyakubja and Goria. Apart from these four, Ahir sub-caste like Ghoshi, Dhadhor and Sadgop are also found in small numbers. Among them the first three never sell either milk, ghee or butter, and have, to a large extent, became cultivator.

The titles generally used by the Yadav/Ahirs community in Bihar are the Rai/Ray, Roy, Chaudhary, Gope, Mandal, Singh, Raut, Bhagat, Mahto etc.

In Kosi division of Bihar, people of the Yadav/Ahir caste worship their caste deity Bisu Raut, whose temple is situated on the banks of the Gogri river.

Gobanai Baba is worshipped by Yadav/Ahir families of Darbhanga district. His temple is situated in village Mahulia.

Lorikayan is sung by Yadav/Ahir community of Bihar, it is a folk song of veer rasa where events from the life of Lorik, a Ahir hero are described. This epic is more popular in Bhojpuri, Maithili and Magahi.

Around 1933–1934, the Yadavs joined with the Kurmis and Koeris to form the Triveni Sangh, a caste federation that by 1936 claimed to have a million supporters. This coalition followed an alliance for the 1930 local elections which fared badly at the polls. The new grouping had little electoral success: it won a few seats in the 1937 elections but was stymied by a two-pronged opposition which saw the rival Congress wooing some of its more wealthy leading lights to a newly formed unit called the ""Backward Class Federation"" and an effective opposition from upper castes organised to keep the lower castes in their customary place. Added to this, the three putatively allied castes were unable to set aside their communal rivalries and the Triveni Sangh also faced competition from the All India Kisan Sabha, a peasant-oriented socio-political campaigning group run by the Communists. The appeal of the Triveni Sangh had waned significantly by 1947 but had achieved a measure of success away from the ballot box, notably by exerting sufficient influence to bring an end to the begar system of forced unpaid labour and by providing a platform for those voices seeking reservation of jobs in government for people who were not upper castes. Many years later, in 1965, there was an abortive attempt to revive the defunct federation.
In the post Mandal phase Kurmi, Koeri and Yadav, the three backward castes who constitute the upper-OBC due to their advantageous position in the socio-economic sphere of agrarian society became the new political elite of the state.


It is shown in the Bengal Census Report that 80 per cent of the Ahirs in Bihar are engaged in agriculture.

The series focussed on a class of prepubescent children in a school – Class P5, similar to The Bash Street Kids of The Beano. Each strip would sometimes focus on an individual in the group, and how they deal with situations that came up in school.

As the series went on, the character of Kim was joined to Class P5 from issue #3034 dated January 15, 2000, and the character of Dotty was moved from preschool class into P5. The strips also moved away from individual stories and focussed more on the group as a whole.

In Issue #3000, the kids had grown up to become adults with a school reunion theme, with Miss Truncheon now working in a job centre, until the last frame of the story when she immediately resigned, saying she wanted to stay away from "that lot", who had all since taken jobs at the same job centre. They appeared in a one-off in July 2002.

P5 returned as a reprint on 4 November 2006 under the new title of Class Act. The reprints are mainly from 1998 and 1999 for DC Thomson's policy of comic strips being at least 7 years old before they are reprinted. These reprints ended when The Dandy relaunched in August 2007.

Luigi Tagliaferri, known as Luigi di Pagnona, was born in Pagnona in Valsassina, but grew up in Mandello, descendant of a family of artists specialized in frescoes.
The first artist of the Tagliaferri dynasty was Giambattista Tagliaferri, author of a leather frontal for the church of Pagnona (1752), according to a then widespread taste. Luigi Tagliaferri is the son of Giovanni Maria Tagliaferri (1809-1879) who was for a long time in Venice as an engraver in the art of iron and then in Milan where, as an engraver, he invented a particular decoration technique on marble, of which some essays remain Margno and in Vendrogno. Giovanni Maria Tagliaferri in Milan also became a painter and created the paintings for the chapel of San Rocco in Premana, with a cycle on the plague (the frescoes in the parish church of San Dionigi have however been lost) and he painted the frescoes on the facades of churches such as San Martino of Indovero (1841), the church of Vimogno (1853) or the church of Barcone (1870). His works can be found both in the villages of the valley (Premana, Taceno, Casargo, Indovero and Pasturo) and beyond the lake and in Lecco. The painter was also a teacher in Pagnona and taught the art to his son Luigi Tagliaferri, who moved to Lecco and finally to Mandello.
Luigi Tagliaferri's works are numerous and he worked in Valsassina, in Lecco, in the villages of the lake and also beyond the lake and also in the Milan area. Luigi works with other artists of the family such as the brothers Achille and Basilio and his nephew Giovanni. The activity of the group continued until the 1940s, so that the Tagliaferris are to be considered among the most interesting sacred artists of Lake Como.

Among the best known works by Luigi Tagliaferri is the Via Crucis of Lierna on Lake Como.Tagliaferri frescoed many sacred buildings with paintings both on Lake Como and in Valtellina.Tagliaferri is buried in the family chapel of Mandello del Lario on Lake Como.

African locust bean

The African locust bean ("Parkia biglobosa") is a type of tree that grows in Africa. It is also known as the African mesquite, néré, or dawadawa tree. People in many African countries use the seeds and fruits of this tree in their cooking. 

The African locust bean tree is a medium-sized tree that can grow up to 20 meters (65 feet) tall. It has a dense crown of leaves and produces long, brown pods that contain seeds. The seeds are surrounded by a sweet pulp.


The African locust bean tree is important to many communities in Africa. It provides a source of food, traditional medicine, and additional income. People sell the seeds, powder, and other products made from the tree in local markets.

Conserving the African locust bean tree is important to ensure its availability for future generations. Deforestation and unsustainable harvesting practices threaten the tree's survival. Efforts are being made to promote sustainable cultivation, protect the tree's natural habitats, and raise awareness on how to combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. Another possible reason for the need for conservation is the wildfires found in the regions from 2001-2006

2023 United States debt-ceiling crisis

On January 19, 2023, the United States hit its debt ceiling. This led to a crisis, as part of an debate within Congress about how the government should spend money and how it should deal with the national debt. Because of this, Janet Yellen, the Secretary of the Treasury, started using "extraordinary measures" until the crisis was over. On May 1, 2023, Yellen gave a warning that these measures could stop working by June 1, 2023. This date was later changed to June 5.

The debt ceiling had been increased a few times until December 2021, each time without any requirements, after there was a debt-ceiling crisis in 2013. After the 2023 crisis started, members of the Republican Party thought that the debt ceiling should only be increased with a requirement that the government only spends as much money as it did in 2022. Members of the Democratic Party wanted to pass a "clean bill" to increase the debt ceiling without any requirements, which had happened 3 times while Donald Trump was President.

If the government had run out of money, the Treasury would have had to either default on its debt or decrease payment of money owed to companies and people that had been mandated but not given enough money by Congress. Many people thought that either situation would make the economy crash. If the government had not been able to give new debt, it would have had to decrease the amount of money it could have spent by an amount equal to about 5% of the size of the American economy. , a constitutional scholar, said that defaulting would be unconstitutional because of the 14th Amendment and the government would have to pay its debt back even after hitting the debt ceiling. President Joe Biden said that he was thinking about using the 14th amendment because he thought he had the authority to, but did not know whether it could be used in time to stop the default, since it might be appealed.

On May 27, Biden and Kevin McCarthy, the Speaker of the House at the time, made a deal to increase the debt ceiling but limit government spending. The deal became a bill, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which passed the House on May 31 and the Senate on June 1. Biden signed it into law on June 3, ending the crisis.

The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 is an act of the 118th United States Congress that stopped the debt ceiling until January 2025. It ended the crisis. This law was supported by leaders of both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party.

Patrick McHenry introduced it on May 29, 2023 based on an agreement between Biden and McCarthy. The House approved it on May 31, and the Senate on June 1. Biden signed it into law on June 3.

Aurora Dream went through a hiatus phase shortly after Morales moved to Miami in early 2017 when he decided to pursue new business opportunities; around this time, Morales spent most of his time working corporate jobs and saving up to start his own businesses and consequently make a higher income that could help fund his music projects. 

Starting 2019, Morales reached to his friends Mangus Steed and Alejandro Hernández to help him record bass and program drums for 8 newer songs he had written.

Around June 2019, Morales attended Polyphia's Music Camp hosted by the Music Masters Collective. During the camp, he was invited to perform on stage by Tim Henson. During his performance he decided to play two songs from Aurora Dream.

Later in the same year, he rerecorded Parallel Colors with a much better production approach. He later combined all new 8 tracks along with the new version of Parallel Colors and turn them into the first Aurora Dream album he titled RUBIX. 

In early 2020, Morales asked well-known producer Randy Slaugh to work on RUBIX. Additionally, he asked keyboardist and synth player Eric Guenther from The Contortionist to co-produce the record. 

As Morales continued working on the album, he realized it was very important to continue learning from other talented musicians that could inspire his writing journey. Therefore, he decided to attend a music webinar hosted by guitarist Jesse Cash from Erra, followed by an exclusive lesson he scheduled with guitarist Thomas Erak from The Fall of Troy and finally a guitar lesson with Marcos Mena from Standards. Additionally, Morales received some artist coaching from guitarists Angel Vivaldi & Jason Richardson. 

Morales also reached out to guitarists Tim Henson, Nick Johnston, Javier Reyes from Animals as Leaders, Sithu Aye, Angel Vivaldi, Ichika Nito, Mark Holcomb from Periphery, Felix Martin and Josh Martin from Little Tybee to be featured on RUBIX, to which they all agreed and greatly contributed to the project. 

During the beginning of 2021, Morales decided to contact Simon Grove and asked him to mix RUBIX. He also asked Chris Allison to track real drums for the record. Shortly after he reached out to Moises D' Bello who helped with mastering for the album. 

While RUBIX mixing was taking place, Morales wrote a new song for Aurora Dream titled A New Infinite. He featured Simon Grove and Plini as double guest artists. This song was strongly inspired by the online culture at the time and the new hyperpop, drum&bass & glitchcore movements.

Around the same time, Morales decided to work on a remake version "Parallel Colors - 2016 Version". This time drums were performed and recorded by Chris Allison, mixing was handled by Simon Grove and mastering was done by Moises D' Bello.

In September 2022, Morales combined some guitar parts from "Parallel Colors - 2016 Version" with beats, trap-lofi production and other electronic elements that helped creating a new remix he titled Parallel Beats. This single came right after RUBIX and it features guitarists KEYAN, Jake Howsam Lowe from Plini, and Charles Caswell from Berried Alive.

Finally, right after "Parallel Beats" was released, Morales decided to work with a well known YoutTuber that makes 8-bit music named Kevin Weaver. This collaboration resulted in the creation of an 8-bit remix of "Parallel Colors - 2016 Version" that was titled Parallel 8its. Shortly after, this single led to the creation of 8-bit album remix of "RUBIX" that was titled RUBIT. This single and album was produced and mixed by Kevin Weaver while mastering was handled by Moises D' Bello.

In August 2023, Morales attended the John Petrucci's Guitar Universe (JPGU) 4.0 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This enriching experience provided him with invaluable lessons from world-renowned musicians and guitarists such as John Petrucci from Dream Theater, Tosin Abasi from Animals as Leaders, Fredrik Åkesson from Opeth and Ghost, Lari Basilio, Ola Englund, Guthrie Govan, Tim Henson from Polyphia, Dave LaRue, Scott LePage from Polyphia, Mike Mangini from Dream Theater, Aaron Marshall from Intervals, Rena Petrucci, Plini, Jason Richardson, Joscho Stephan, and Zakk Wylde. The insights and skills acquired continue to shape his solo endeavors and contributions to Aurora Dream.

In addition to being a guitarist, Morales founded several companies and projects, these include: Duniel AV, Novatoshi, Chromalize and Zelvox.

Morales is strongly passionate about art & technology; Aside from that, he is a huge fan of video games, anime, science & space. 

Morales cites several influential musicians and bands from various genres. Notably, he cites Buckethead, Guthrie Govan, John Petrucci, Ron Jarzombek, Keith Merrow, Thomas Erak, Will Swan, Chris Letchford, Steve Vai, Steven Wilson, Porcupine Tree, Dream Theater, Opeth, Protest the Hero, The Fall of Troy, Linkin Park, and Deftones as being important for his development as a guitar player and songwriter.

Itatehyōzu Shrine

Itatehyozu Shrine (Japanese: 板手兵主神社, Itatehyōzu Jinja) is a Shinto shrine in Himeji, Hyōgo, Japan. It is renowned for its Single Mountain Rite held every 60 years and Three Mountains Rite held every 20 years. The shrine's rituals are related to rituals at Iwa Shrine a famous nearby shrine. It is a Sōja shrine and enshrines all the gods of Harima Province.

The Itatehyozu Shrine is believed to have an ancient connection with the Iwa Shrine, especially in terms of the deity worshipped and the rituals performed. While the Iwa Shrine is primarily dedicated to the deity Ōnamuchi-no-mikoto, associated with Mount Miya, Itatehyozu Shrine’s rites are said to have been established at the request of the Iwa Deity.

The Itatehyozu Shrine follows a distinct cycle for its two principal rites. The Single Mountain Rite is performed once every sixty years, while the Three Mountains Rite takes place every twenty years.

The Single Mountain Rite is an elaborate ceremony that pays homage to a single sacred mountain. This ritual involves a week-long sacred carnival event (kami-nigiwai gyōji) that sees the construction of a bamboo and cloth mountain, which is approximately fifteen meters in height. This structure is placed at the entrance of the shrine. A mountaintop shrine or 'hokora' is placed at the summit of this artificial mountain. Atop the shrine gate, a small hall is established. During the ceremony, sacred food offerings, including a variety of mochi, are presented to the deity.

The Three Mountains Rite is focused on worshipping the three mountains surrounding the Iwa Shrine – Mount Takahata, Mount Hanasaki, and Mount Shirakura. Although this rite is performed every twenty years, it is similar in nature to the Single Mountain Rite in terms of the offerings and rituals.

As mentioned earlier, the rituals at Itatehyozu Shrine are believed to have been established upon the request of the Iwa Deity. Iwa Shrine has its own set of rites, namely the Single Mountain Rite and Three Mountains Rite. However, the frequency of these rituals at Iwa Shrine is exactly the opposite of those at Itatehyozu Shrine: the Single Mountain Rite at Iwa Shrine is held every twenty years, and the Three Mountains Rite every sixty years. Moreover, at Iwa Shrine, the rituals involve carrying a new mountaintop shrine to the summit of the mountain, and a white flag is raised.

The rituals at Itatehyozu Shrine are highly significant culturally, and are awaited with anticipation due to their infrequent occurrence. They play an important role in the religious and cultural life of the local community. The rites are believed to ensure protection, prosperity, and harmony for the region, as they involve offering respects and homage to the sacred mountains and the deities associated with them.

Wagner Group rebellion

On 23 June 2023, Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin said that soldiers of the Russian Ministry of Defense were attacking his soldiers. Prigozhin promised to take revenge on the Ministry of Defense. Prigozhin said the "evil" military leaders must be stopped and said he would "march for justice". 

Prigozhin also said that Russia's reasons for invading Ukraine were lies and that Ukraine and NATO were not planning an attack on the Donbas and Crimea in 2022. He said Sergei Shoigu, the Russian Minister of Defence, was making Russia lose in the war. He also said the military attacked the Wagner Group. The Federal Security Service (FSB) opened a criminal case against him after these statements. Prigozhin took his 25,000 soldiers out of Ukraine and into Rostov-on-Don in Rostov Oblast, Russia. He said, "If anyone gets in our way, we will destroy everything!" Putin responded to PMC Wagner's attack by saying its actions were "treason" and a "stab in the back".

In 2014, Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin founded the Wagner Group. It is a Russian private military company. Because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Yevgeny Prigozhin and Wagner Group got more influence in the military. The estimated number of Wagnerites grew from "several thousand" fighters in 2017–2018 to around 50,000 fighters by January 2023.

According to news website "Meduza", right before a Russian invasion of Ukraine, Prigozhin had tense relations with the Russian leadership. Prigozhin criticized Sergei Shoigu for the actions of the Russian army in Syria. He said that the Russian military was using "outdated methods."

The growth of the influence of Wagner Group was because the first Russian plans failed to quickly beat Ukraine. In the first months of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian army lost many soldiers. The Russian leaders began to recruit mercenaries to fight for Russia. Prigozhin was given many resources. He able to recruit prisoners into Wagner. PMC Wagner became a private army for Prigozhin. The Russian Ministry of Defense and the Russian General Staff did not like this began trying to limit Prigozhin's growing influence. Prigozhin began to criticize the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. On 5 June, Prigozhin showed a video on his social media channels claiming to show a captured Russian colonel, Lt. Colonel Roman Venevitin of Russia’s 72nd Brigade, admitting to have told his troops to attack Wagner troops.

On 23 June 2023, a video was shown in Telegram channels for PMC Wagner. According to Prigozhin, it had been recorded at a Wagner Group mercenary camp that had been attacked by a missile. "Bellingcat" journalist Arik Toler said that the place of the alleged attack is the same as earlier videos of war correspondent Alexander Simonov, who went to the camp. That evening, Prigozhin announced the beginning of an armed conflict with the Ministry of Defense. The message showed up in the Telegram channel of his press service. Prigozhin told anyone who wanted to join the conflict against the Ministry of Defense to do so. He also said that Shoigu had used artillery and helicopters to attack PMC Wagner.

The Russian Defense Ministry said they didn't attack PMC Wagner. After that, the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation said that a criminal case had been started against Prigozhin under Article 279 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (armed rebellion). Generals Sergey Surovikin and Vladimir Alekseev tried to tell the Wagner PMC fighters to stop.

Russia's state-run First Channel announced an "emergency newscast". In it, the host Ekaterina Andreeva claimed that Prigozhin's statements about attacks by the Ministry of Defence on PMC Wagner were fake and that Putin had been told about the situation.

In response to Prigozhin, Russia's military and its national guard deployed armored vehicles in both Moscow and Rostov-on-Don. Rostov-on-Don is a large city near the frontlines in Ukraine where PMC Wagner troops had been attacking from. It is also where Prigozhin had said that PMC Wagner troops were going to.

During the night from 23 to 24 June, Prigozhin claimed that PMC Wagner was going into Rostov-on-Don and told forces of Ministry of Defence not to oppose his army.

Prigozhin also claimed on 23 June that the head of the General Staff of Russian military had told the country's air force to attack PMC Wagner soldiers, who were moving next to civilian vehicles. He said the General Staff didn't care about the lives of innocent people, "just as they have been killing their own population for a year and half instead of fighting the enemy". He also claimed that some pilots refused to follow the General Staff's orders, and thanked them.

Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov said the situation was an "attempted mutiny" and said that Russia's military agencies were telling Putin about the events.

Russia blocked Google News because of the situation.

On 24 June, Prigozhin claimed that Wagner PMC fighters shot down a military helicopter that opened fire on Wagner.

Unconfirmed footage showed a battle in Rostov-on-Don between Wagner and Russian military forces.

On 24 June 2023, Yevgeny Prigozhin was charged by the Russian government with organizing an armed uprising after he threatened to attack Russian forces in answer to an air strike on his soldiers. Russian security forces said he was launching a coup. Russian generals told Wagner's fighters to go back. Meanwhile Russia's national security service, FSB, said it had filed criminal charges against Prigozhin and moved to arrest him.

According to Russian state media reports, and some Western media, Wagner Group forces have taken control of the Southern Military District building in Rostov.

Yevgeny Prigozhin released a video showing him in the military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don. He said that all military buildings in the city were under control of PMC Wagner. Prigozhin also said they had taken the city's military airport.

Mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, announced that anti-terrorist actions were being used in the federal city of Moscow.

Rostov-on-Don is connected to Moscow by the M-4 Highway. There have been reports of Wagner troops using the highway to get closer to Moscow. The governments of Lipetsk Oblast and Voronezh Oblast have told all civilians to stay inside after reports of fighting along the highway. The company Avtodor, which manages Russian highways, told civilians to stay off the M-4 highway on Telegram. The Russian news agency TASS said that traffic was blocked on the M-4 and that cars were being turned around.

Social media posts showed videos of fighting between Wagner PMC troops and Russian military in Voronezh, with Reuters showing Russian military reports. Voronezh is halfway between Rostov and Moscow.

According to reports, the PMC Wagner has taken control of all military buildings in Voronezh. After this, a state of counter-terrorism started in Voronezh, similar to the one in Moscow.

Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the country for the first time since the beginning of the rebellion in a televised address. He said the actions of the PMC Wagner were "treason" and he promised to take "harsh steps" to get rid of the rebellion. Putin said that the fighting was a threat to Russia itself. He said the rebellion was a "stab in the back". He compared the rebellion to the 1917 Russian Revolution.

On the 24th June, at approximately 17:30 UTC, the first reports of a peace deal arose. In them, Prigozhin allegedly stated that he has "made his point" and that the Wagner column en route to Moscow was turning around and heading back to field camps. It was rumoured that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was a mediator and a third party to the negotiations between the Russian Government and the Wagner Group. 

In the afternoon, the citizens of Moscow have all been panicking because of the rebellion. The mayor of Moscow had earlier announced to all citizens of Moscow to “Stay at homes at all times without leaving and travelling around the city.” 

When late evening was coming in Russia, whilst Moscow was in panic and the Wagner tanks were a 4-hour drive from Moscow, ready to take the capital, Yevgeny Prigozhin announced that his troops are “halting”, and turning back to avoid “bloodshed”. Alexander Lukashenko, President of Belarus said that there were day-long negotiations between him and Prigozhin, until finally a deal was made. 

Later on in the night of 24/25 June 2023, Prigozhin, under the conditions of the deal, was told that he shall not face criminal charges, and instead, move to Belarus, to Alexander Lukashenko.

Abdulmejid I

Abdulmejid I or Abdul Majid I (, ; 25 April 182325 June 1861) was the 31st sultan of the Ottoman Empire and succeeded his father Mahmud II on 2 July 1839. His reign was notable for the rise of nationalist movements within the empire's territories. Abdulmejid wanted to encourage Ottomanism among secessionist subject nations and stop rising nationalist movements within the empire, but despite new laws and reforms to integrate non-Muslims and non-Turks more thoroughly into Ottoman society, his efforts failed in this regard.

He tried to forge alliances with the major powers of Western Europe, namely the United Kingdom and France, who fought alongside the Ottoman Empire in the Crimean War against Russia. During the Congress of Paris on 30 March 1856, the Ottoman Empire was officially included among the European family of nations.

Abdulmejid's biggest achievement was the announcement and application of the Tanzimat (reorganization) reforms which were prepared by his father and effectively started the modernization of the Ottoman Empire in 1839. For this achievement, one of the imperial anthems of the Ottoman Empire, the March of Abdulmejid, was named after him.

Khudadad Khan

Khudadad Khan, VC (20 October 1888 – 8 March 1971) was a Pakistani recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. During the First World War, on 31 October 1914 at Hollebeke, Belgium, 26-year-old Khan, serving in the British Indian Army, performed an act of bravery for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

He was the first British India subject to earn the Victoria Cross, after members of the British Indian Army became eligible for the Victoria Cross in 1911, replacing the Indian Order of Merit first class.

Born on 20 October 1888 in the village of Dab in Chakwal District of the Punjab Province, British India (now Pakistan) in a Punjabi Muslim Rajput family of Minhas Clan, Khudadad Khan was a Sepoy in the 129th Duke of Connaught's Own Baluchis, British Indian Army (now 11th Battalion The Baloch Regiment of Pakistan Army). The battalion formed part of the Indian Corps, which was sent to France and Flanders in 1914 to reinforce the British forces fighting on the Western Front during the First World War. He took part in the defence of Lille until it was overrun by the Germans.

In October 1914, when the Germans launched the First Battle of Ypres, the newly arrived 129th Baluchis were rushed to the frontline to support the hard-pressed British troops. On 31 October, two companies of the Baluchis bore the brunt of the main German attack near the village of Gheluvelt in Hollebeke Sector. The out-numbered Baluchis fought gallantly but were overwhelmed after suffering heavy casualties. Sepoy Khudadad Khan's machine-gun team, along with one other, kept their guns in action throughout the day, preventing the Germans from making the final breakthrough. The other gun was disabled by a shell and eventually, Khudadad Khan's own team was overrun. All the men were killed by bullets or bayonets except Khudadad Khan who, despite being badly wounded, had continued working his gun. He was left for dead by the enemy but managed to crawl back to his regiment during the night. Thanks to his bravery, and that of his fellow Baluchis, the Germans were held up just long enough for Indian and British reinforcements to arrive. They strengthened the line, and prevented the German Army from reaching the vital ports; Khan was awarded the Victoria Cross.

He was supposed to be awarded the medal on the same day, 5 December 1914, as Darwan Singh Negi VC but Khan was too sick. Khan was presented with the Victoria Cross by King George V during a visit to troops in France on 26 January 1915. As such Khan is regarded as the first Indian recipient, as Negi's VC action was on a later date.

Khan was subsequently sent for treatment at the Royal Pavilion military hospital in Brighton. Khan retired as a Subedar in 1929, after which he settled in the Punjab. He made several visits to Britain in connection with the Victoria Cross, including the Victoria Cross centenary review parade in Hyde Park, London, in June 1956. He died on 8 March 1971 aged 82, and is buried in Chak No. 25, Mandi Bahauddin. His Victoria Cross is on display at his ancestral house in Village Dab (Chakwal), Pakistan. He was at the time of his death the last surviving British India World War I veteran who had served on the Western Front.

A statue of Khudadad Khan is at the entrance of the Pakistan Army Museum in Rawalpindi.

In 2016 a play by Ishy Din, "Wipers", about Khudadad Khan's feat was put on in a number of English theatres.

Rhacophorus is a group of frogs. They are in the shrub frog family (Rhacophoridae). They live in India, Japan, China, and Southeast Asia. Scientists say this group has more than 40 species in it.

These frogs have long toes with webbed skin. They use this skin to slow down when they fall or jump out of trees. This is called parachuting. People call them "flying frogs" because of this.

These frogs are related to "Polypedates". Scientists used to call them the same genus. Even today, some scientists think ""P." feae" and the Chinese flying frog (""R." dennysi") might be in the wrong group.
These frogs lay their eggs in foam nests in trees. They make the nests on branches hanging over water. Once the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water.Some species like Rhacophorus kio will wrap this and cover this foam nest with leaves. 

These species are in the genus "Rhacophorus":

The following is a partial family tree of "Rhacophorus" from Pyron & Wiens (2011). Only nine species are included. "Rhacophorus" is a sister group of "Polypedates".

Kirby's Dream Buffet

Kirby's Dream Buffet is a party video game for the Nintendo Switch. It is a spin-off game in the "Kirby" series. It was released on August 17, 2022.

The game can be played by more than one player. The player is Kirby, who rolls around and eats strawberries. The goal is to eat as much strawberries as possible in the shortest amount of time.

There are three play modes that the player can choose from the main menu.

In this mode, the game can be played in singleplayer (against CPU) or in multiplayer (against a real player who is in the same room). The maximum number of players is two.

This mode cannot be played by one person. Here, the player connects to the Internet and can play with unknown people. He can also play with a friend who is far away by using a password.

Local Play Mode allows playing wirelessly with nearby Nintendo Switches. To play together, everyone has to have his own Nintendo Switch. The maximum number of players is four.

In the whole game there are 4 match options to choose from.

In this case, the match starts with a Single Race. Then, Kirby must fight in a Single Minigame. After that, another Single Race starts. The Gourmet Grand Prix ends on a Battle Royale, after which the winner of the match is chosen. 

Single race is composed of an obstacle course. Players fight to be the first Kirby that eats the biggest cake.

A Minigame is always played on a small, flat surface. The strawberries can fall in boxes or randomly appear in some places. Kirbys will often push each other, which makes it harder to navigate (control). 

A Battle Royale is a match in which Kirbys try to push each other off the map while eating strawberries at the same time. Every time a player is pushed off the board, the Kirby who has done this steals many strawberries from the Kirby who has fallen. Copy food abilities are used here very often.

The next day, Franklin became a hurricane. On August 28, after entering conditions more suitable for strengthening, it quickly became a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 150 mph. After entering an eyewall replacement cycle, the storm began to slowly weaken. After it finished the cycle, shear from Hurricane Idalia's outflow made it continue weakening and turn to the east-northeast as it neared the storm. On September 1, Franklin became a Category 1-equivalent extratropical cyclone nearly northeast of Bermuda. On September 4, as exFranklin moved north of the Azores, it began to show signs of becoming a tropical cyclone again, but it never became fully tropical, and it stopped being tracked on September 7.

Crossover SUV

A crossover SUV, crossover utility vehicle, or CUV is a type of SUV that is based on a unibody structure. These cars are usually lighter than heavier body-on-frame SUVs. The term was first used on the 1979 'AMC Eagle', and the first modern example is the 1994 Toyota RAV4. Unlike general SUVs that are usually all-wheel drive, or four-wheel drive, crossovers tend to also have an option of all-wheel, rear-wheel, or front-wheel drive.

Vehicles in this segment are usually based on a car/unibody platform, typically used on sedans, station wagons, and hatchbacks. Since the late 2010s, crossovers have started replacing minivans.

CUVs have three advantages over SUVs:

Mercedes-Benz GLE

The Mercedes-Benz GLE, formerly Mercedes-Benz ML-Class is a mid-size SUV produced by the luxury car brand Mercedes-Benz since early 1997.

The original M-Class was a typical body-on-frame SUV, before in 2005, switching to unibody. In April 2015, the M-Class/ML was renamed to 'GLE'. Hybrid trims were available from 2005.

The 1997 ML-Class, which was code named 'W163' was originally made to replace the G-Class, which was only 11 years old at the time of the plan. A plan was made in 1992 to base the car on the Mitsubishi Pajero, but in 1993, the plan was dropped because of 'technical issues'. In 1993, Mercedes had made a plan to search for a location to build a manufacturing plant. In July 1996, construction had started in Vance, a city in Tuscaloosa, with the first car being produced in February 1997.

In 2001, the M-Class had gotten an small update.

In 1999, Mercedes had already started working on the second generation of the M-Class, after 2 years of being in production. In 2000, there were already design ideas for the new car. The new ML-Class' codename is 'W164'. It now shares a unibody structure with the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class. The new M-Class is slightly larger than the previous generation.
Although it had only been 1 year since the 2nd generation M-Class, in 2006, there were design ideas for the new ML-Class. In 2008, the chosen design was designed in 2008 by Emiel Burki. The new M-Class, codename W166, rolled of the production line in July 20, 2011 for the 2012 model year. It is improved in a large amount of ways, includes extra legroom, and has unwanted things from the previous generation removed. It takes styling cues from the 2012-2015 Mercedes-Benz E-Class, and has full-LED headlights and taillights. The ML-Class is positioned in between the Mercedes-Benz GLK and the GL-Class 

The new W166 GLE was unveiled to the public in January 2015, along with the new coupe SUV version of the W166 GLE, codenamed C292. The main reason it was renamed to 'GLE', was because of Mercedes' new naming strategy. Now, the GLE is positioned between the Mercedes-Benz GLC and the GLS.

The 4th generation GLE was unveiled at the 2018 Paris Motor Show, codenamed V167. The new GLE offers two plug-in hybrid options in Europe, and two petrol options in the U.S. For the first time ever, the car under the GLE name offers a 7-seat option. The plug-in hybrid's all-electric range is . The coupe SUV's new codename is C167, and in China, the new GLE offers a longer wheelbase version for the first time ever. The new GLE is visibly longer than its predecessors.

Bellows camera

A bellows camera is a type of camera designed in the era of the daguerreotype ( years 1840-1850 ) and, with many improvements, still in use today. It comprises a flexible bellows that forms a light-tight seal between two adjustable frames, the frontal one with the lens, and the other on the back of the camera with the ground-glass screen that will be replaced by the photographic film holder to take de photo. 

The bellows is flexible, with an accordion fold. It covers the space between the lens and the film, and flexes to accommodate frame movements. The front frame is a plate at the front of the camera that holds the lens and usually a shutter.

On the back side of the camera, there is a ground-glass screen, used to focus and compose the image before exposure, and is replaced by holder with the sensitive film, a photographic plate or a digital image sensor, to take the shot. The front and rear frames can be moved in various ways relative to each other, unlike most other types of cameras. This allows to control the focus, depth of field and perspective . The camera is normally used with a tripod or a similar type of support.

In photography, the bellows is a foldable part that is used in large and medium format photographic cameras, to allow the movement of the lenses with respect to the focal plane for a suitable focus, used in certain camera models such as the one in the picture..

Boardshorts

Boardshorts are a type of swimwear or beachwear. They can also be general casual wear (informal clothing), however they usually don't have big pockets for a phone and wallet like other casual shorts. Boardshorts usually have only a very small inside pocket to hold car keys. Compared to other styles of swimwear or beachwear, they are quite long (approximately knee length) and loose-fitting. They are made of material that is quick-drying. They are generally made from strong and smooth polyester or nylon material. They are very popular with teenaged boys. Boardshorts were popular for boys and men at first, but are now also worn by girls and women. 

Boardshorts are popular to wear at swimming pools and beaches. Originally they were for surfing. They are also popular for wakeboarding, riding jet skis and water skiing. Boardshorts are very popular in North America. They are less popular in other parts of the world, where other suit styles are more common. They are not actually very good for swimming if you want to swim quickly. Tighter, form-fitting, swimwear is better to swim fast. However, most men and boys in the United States and Canada do not like to wear tight beachwear that shows the shape of the penis and testicles. In slang, this shape is sometimes called a manbulge or mooseknuckle. People in Europe do not care so much and are happy to wear tighter and more flexible swimwear.

Boardshorts started in the 1950s. Their popularity spread beyond surfing, especially as the skater (skateboard) punk fashion trend started. They are also commonly worn for men's beach volleyball. 

Boardshorts usually do not have an elastic waist like many swim shorts do; instead they have a more rigid waistband which opens at the front, often with a Velcro (or similar hook and loop technology) fly. To be extra safe, the waistband is also held together at the front with a lace-up string (thin rope) tie. Because there are two ways they are kept from falling down, it is uncommon for boardshorts to come off and be lost in the ocean while surfing in rough waves. 

Although the basic design for boardshorts has not changed much over the years, some companies that make them use new technology. Because surfers and other people who like water-sports usually wear boardshorts without underwear (commonly called "freeballing" or "going commando"), one of the major complaints was about the use of velcro for the fly closure. Velcro can entangle or catch pubic hair. This can hurt. To fix this problem, some companies use a neoprene fly instead. This does not allow the fly to completely open, but provides enough stretch so that the shorts can be easily pulled on and off. Pubic hair does not get caught on the neoprene fly. Velcro is not a big problem for people who keep their pubic hair cut short or shave their pubic hair, as is now common.

As players progress through the game, they can collect power-ups that give them special abilities such as double jump or invincibility. The game also features a variety of obstacles that players must avoid, including spinning blades and moving platforms. If the player makes a mistake and hits an obstacle or falls off the course, they will have to start over.

Al-Jamiul Kamil Fee Al-Hadith As-Sahih Al-Shamil or in short Jami ul Kamil (), known in English as The Comprehensive Collection of all Authentic Prophetic Narrations or The Authentic Hadith Encyclopaedia, is a secondary hadith collection book, compiled by the Islamic scholar Imam Ziya-ur-Rahman Azmi (1943 CE – 30 July 2020 CE). In this book, the author claims that he has compiled all Authentic Prophetic Narrations (Sahih Ahadith) from more than two hundred books. Zakir Naik highly praised the book and he stated that he is working on the publication of the english translation of the book. Abubakar Muhammad Zakaria published the first volume of the bengali translation of the book and its Urdu translation under supervision of Sheikh Ibn Bashir and Abdul Rehman Mahdi is in progress too. It contains 16500 Sahih Hadith, of which 8500 hadiths are from Sihah Sittah and the rest have been verified as traditions from other reliable hadith books. Zakir Naik describes his direct experience with the book. According to Sunni Salafi Islamic opinion, it is the world's purest Islamic text after the Qur'an, which was considered Sahih Bukhari prior to its compilation.

Azmi authored this book as the only collection of Hadith's book which compiled all of authentic hadith narrations as per his claim. The book contains Sixteen Thousand Five hundred and forty six (16546) Hadiths in twelve volumes. His work can be summarized as all authentic narrations (Sahih Hadiths) in one book. According to Islamic scholar Muhammad Ishaq Bhatti, "this is such a work that no one has done before."

Water skiing

Water skiing (also waterskiing or water-skiing) is a water sport in which a person is pulled behind a motorboat over water, skimming the surface on two skis or sometimes one ski. It is most common to do on lakes, but can also be done in rivers and oceans.

In the United States, there are over 11 million water skiers. In Australia there are 1.3 million water skiers.

While water skiing is very popular, not everybody thinks it is a good thing. The fast, powerful boats make a lot of noise, cause waves which can cause beach erosion, and sometimes hit swimmers, other boats, or marine life. People often drink alcohol which increases the chance of accidents. Sometimes the person water skiing is injured by falling and hitting the water. Water skiing is also criticized for air pollution from the boats' engines, and the unnecessary use of fuel (usually gasoline) which increases climate change (global warming.)

Neuroplasticity

Neuroplasticity, also known as neural plasticity, or brain plasticity, is the ability of connections in the brain to change through growth and reorganization.

Neuroplasticity was once thought by scientists who study the brain to exist only during childhood, but research in the latter half of the 20th century showed that many aspects of the brain can be altered (or are "plastic") even through adulthood. However, the developing brain exhibits a higher degree of plasticity than the adult brain.

Arabic language in Islam

In Islam, Arabic language is given more importance than any other language, because it is the language of Qur'an and Hadith, the main religious sources of Islam, which is called Quranic Arabic.

It is said in the Qur'an, Allah says,
In the explanation of this verse, Allama Abul Hussain Ahmad bin Fares said,

As most Muslim scholars cite the hadith of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad as saying that every letter of the Qur'an brings ten unit of piety (Sawab). That's why, they encourage to pronounce original Islamic Arabic word "Allah" (ﷲ),Nabi" (نبي), "Rasul" (رسول), "Malaika" (ملاءكة‎)"jannah" (جنّة‎), "jahannam " (جهنم‎) etc., as an argument they say, the word Allah is used in the Qur'an, so when saying the word, ten unit of sawab or neki will be obtained, which cannot be gotten by the pronunciation of Khuda, Creator, Ishwara, God, payambar, Farishta, Behesht, Dujokh or other non-Quranic and non-Arabic synonyms.

Umar Ibn Khattab said,

According to Islamic scholars, "The reason for the importance of the Arabic language is that the Arabic language has many advantages and characteristics, but what has given it the greatest importance is its connection with the religion of Islam revealed in this language. The connection of the Arabic language with the revelation of the Qur'an, which came to all mankind. The rituals of Islam are performed only in the Arabic language. The Arabic language is characterized by sophistication of expression, eloquence in speech and abundance of artistic imagery. According to scholars, to preserve the Arabic language is to preserve the religion of Islam. A complete statement of a written text can only be made in Arabic, And so the Qur'an was not revealed without it. Constantly speaking Arabic has a positive effect on the mind, religion and morals. Ignorance of Arabic is one of the causes of deviation from the true religion. Arabic is an ancient, stable and historically well-established language."

Ahmed Hussain Sharif in his book "Why Pray in Arabic" (Why is prayer offered in Arabic?) reasons for praying in Arabic are:
Finally he says, "Thus we see that the sweetness, dignity, beauty and spirituality of the prayer depend on the prayer being recited in the original Arabic; and if the prayer is recited in translation, the literary and artistic value of the Qur'an is bound to be lost; and by the translated prayer is the first to suffer will be the Islamic brotherhood."


Lucid Dreams (song)

"Lucid Dreams" (also known as "Lucid Dreams (Forget Me)") is the second single off of American rapper Juice Wrld's debut studio album "Goodbye & Good Riddance". It also appears on the 2017 EP "JuiceWrld 9 9 9". The song was released on May 4, 2018. The song was able to make it to #2 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and is certified 11× Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). 

Juice Wrld made the song about his pain and feelings after going through a breakup. The song interpolates the 1993 Sting song "Shape of my Heart". Sting gave Juice Wrld his blessing to use the song and said "'Lucid Dreams' was my favorite of all the many interpolations of 'Shape of my Heart,' it will resonate for many years to come,"

On May 11, 2018, a music video for the song was released. It was directed by Cole Bennett. In the video, Juice is seen rapping with his head poking up through the floor. Through the video there are scenes of him smoking a joint in a dimly-lit stairwell and exchanging glances with a woman applying heavy makeup in a mirror.

Variovorax

Variovorax is a bacterial genus from the family . Its designated species is which arose from the species "Alcaligenes paradoxus" being grouped under the Variovorax genus. The cell size of Variovorax is 0.5–0.6 μm × 1.2–3.0 μm and the optimal growth temperature is 30 degrees Celsius. The bacteria utilise various organic compounds as a carbon source, including fructose, galactose, and glucose, in order to promote plant growth.

Variovorax cells function alone or in pairs, and use a flagellum to move around.They contain carotenoid pigments which leads to a yellow appearance of the colonies. The bacteria are tolerate to a wide variety of metals including cobalt, copper, and nickel, which allows for the bacteria to survive in many environments.

Bacteria of the Variovorax genus can often be found in damp, dark conditions of soil and water. The bacteria can also be found in a variety of diverse habitats, including the rhizosphere, which is a section of soil in close proximity to the root microbiome. Other habitats that have been recognised include glacial settings, soils contaminated with chemicals and plastics, and riverbed sediments.

Variovorax species have many diverse roles in their environmental surroundings, a noticeable one being promoting plant growth. There is a variety of mechanisms by which the bacteria can accomplish this, including the preventing of plant pathogens being produced, reducing the amount of stress a plant undergoes, and also increasing the number of nutrients that are available. Other roles can also be witnessed, including the cycling of various elements across a range of environments including arsenic. It is thought to oxidise As (III) to As (V) via a detoxification mechanism.

Another potential use which has been discovered for the Variovorax genus is its role in bioremediation studies. "Variovorax paradoxus" has been found to be a potential use in the bioremediation of soils contaminated with linuron, which could be depolluted through biopurification via bioaugmentation.

Streptomycin

Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic, and was the first of these to be discovered in 1943 by Albert Shatz. The use of streptomycin involves the disruption of protein synthesis within the ribosome, preventing replication of bacteria. It arises from the bacteria "Streptomyces griseus" and is majorly used in the treatment of infections from aerobic gram-negative bacteria. 
Streptomycin has been classified by the World Health Organisation as a critically important antimicrobial for human medicine. The most common use of streptomycin today is the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. The antibiotic has a variety of antibacterial activity which is beneficial for the treatment of a wide range of infections. Other infections treated using streptomycin include pneumonia, Mycobacterium avium complex-MAC, E. coli influenza, plague, and tularemia.

Common side effects of the use of streptomycin coincide with those seen with the use of other aminoglycoside antibiotics. These include both kidney and ear toxicity, alongside chronic kidney disease. Other dangerous side effects of the use of this drug also include vestibular and auditory system disorders.

The use of streptomycin involves the disruption of protein synthesis within the ribosome, preventing the replication of bacteria. The antibiotic creates ionic bonds with the negatively charged sections of the bacterial cell membrane to access the inner cytoplasmic membrane. Streptomycin is only effective against aerobic bacteria as an electron transport system used within the respiratory cycle is needed, however, the antibiotic is able to inhibit both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

Joh Bjelke-Petersen

Sir Johannes "Joh" Bjelke-Petersen (13 January 191123 April 2005), also nicknamed Sir Joh, was an Australian politician who served as the 31st Premier of Queensland. He was Queensland's longest-serving and longest-lived Premier. While he was Premier, he was the leader of the Queensland branch of the National Party, which used to be called the Country Party.

He was a very conservative politician with many controversial views. He was also very controversial because his government did many things that were corrupt. Some historians have even described him as being "semi-authoritarian". For example, he is responsible for the "Bjelkemander", which was a type of gerrymander (which is a practice that makes it easier for one party to win government). The Bjelkemander meant that more seats were in rural and remote areas so the National Party would always be in government, because the Labor Party and the Liberal Party got most of their votes from cities. He was also involved in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, which made Gough Whitlam resign as Prime Minister.

He once tried to run in the 1987 federal election to try and become Prime Minister, as part of the "Joh for Canberra" campaign. However, he did not do it because of the Fitzgerald Inquiry, which was a controversial inquiry that exposed corruption in his government and saw many of his ministers taken to jail, some even lost their knighthoods. This saw him resign as Premier and he quit politics altogether. It also was a reason that his party lost the 1991 state election. He was later trialed in court for perjury, but was not convicted and he was not trialed again because he was too old.

As a child, de León experienced the challenges faced by many working-class families. He witnessed the struggles of his mother, who raised him as a single parent after his father died when he was young. These experiences influenced his later political career and commitment to advocating for marginalized communities.

De León attended San Diego State University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political science and Chicano Studies. During his time in college, he became involved in activism and community organizing, working on issues such as affordable housing and immigrant rights. These early experiences sparked his passion for social justice and laid the foundation for his future political career.

After completing his undergraduate studies, de León continued his education at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he pursued a Master's degree in public administration. He further honed his leadership skills and deepened his understanding of public policy, preparing him for his future roles in government.

De León's upbringing and educational background played a significant role in shaping his perspective and commitment to fighting for the rights of marginalized communities. These early experiences instilled in him a determination to address the systemic inequalities and barriers faced by many Californians, particularly those from immigrant backgrounds.

Kevin de León served in the California State Assembly, representing the 45th district from 2006 to 2010. During his tenure, he worked on various legislative initiatives and advocated for policies that aimed to address social and environmental issues.

As a member of the California State Assembly, de León focused on a range of issues affecting his constituents. He was particularly passionate about affordable housing, healthcare, and education. He championed legislation aimed at expanding access to healthcare services, improving educational opportunities, and promoting affordable housing options for low-income individuals and families.

De León also played a key role in advancing environmental policies during his time in the Assembly. He worked to increase renewable energy usage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As a strong advocate for clean energy, he co-authored the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, also known as AB 32, which set ambitious goals for reducing the state's greenhouse gas emissions.

During his tenure, de León demonstrated a commitment to representing the needs and concerns of his constituents. He actively engaged with community organizations and worked to amplify the voices of underrepresented communities. His efforts earned him recognition as a champion for social and environmental justice.

De León's experience in the California State Assembly provided him with a solid foundation for his future political career. His work on critical issues and his dedication to serving the people of California laid the groundwork for his subsequent roles in the California State Senate and his bid for the United States Senate.

Kevin de León served in the California State Senate, representing the 22nd district from 2010 to 2018. During his tenure, he played a significant role in shaping California's legislative landscape, focusing on issues such as immigration, environmental policy, and social justice.

As a State Senator, de León became a prominent voice for immigrant rights. He authored the California Trust Act, which aimed to limit local law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The act sought to protect undocumented immigrants who were otherwise law-abiding residents and fostered a more inclusive approach to immigration enforcement.

De León also prioritized environmental issues and worked towards advancing renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. He authored Senate Bill 350, which aimed to increase California's renewable energy usage and improve energy efficiency in buildings. This legislation played a crucial role in shaping the state's clean energy goals and commitment to combating climate change.

In addition to his work on immigration and environmental policy, de León advocated for social justice initiatives. He supported criminal justice reforms and efforts to address economic inequality. De León's focus on social and economic equity was evident in his efforts to increase the minimum wage and expand access to affordable housing.

During his time in the California State Senate, de León served as the President pro tempore from 2014 to 2018. As the leader of the Senate, he played a pivotal role in shaping the legislative agenda and guiding policy discussions.

De León's tenure in the California State Senate solidified his reputation as a progressive leader and a staunch advocate for marginalized communities. His work on immigration, environmental policy, and social justice contributed to his influence within the Democratic Party and his subsequent bid for the United States Senate.

Kevin de León ran for the United States Senate in 2018, challenging incumbent Dianne Feinstein. Although unsuccessful in his bid, his campaign made a significant impact and helped shift the conversation within the Democratic Party in California.

De León's campaign focused on progressive policy positions and a vision for a more inclusive and equitable future. He emphasized issues such as healthcare, immigration reform, and income inequality. De León advocated for a universal healthcare system and championed the idea of Medicare for All, aiming to ensure that all Californians had access to affordable and quality healthcare.

His strong stance on immigration reform resonated with many voters. De León supported comprehensive immigration reform and sought to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation. He emphasized the contributions immigrants make to California's economy and society, advocating for policies that would provide a pathway to citizenship and protect the rights of undocumented individuals.

Throughout his campaign, de León also highlighted his commitment to combatting climate change and advancing clean energy solutions. He stressed the need for California to lead the nation in addressing environmental issues, and he proposed bold initiatives to reduce carbon remissions and expand renewable energy sources.

De León's bid for the U.S. Senate demonstrated his continued dedication to advocating for progressive policies and fighting for social and environmental justice. His campaign left a lasting impact on the political landscape in California and contributed to ongoing discussions about the future direction of the Democratic Party.

Kevin de León is currently serving on the Los Angeles City Council, a position he has held since 2020. As a council member, he represents the 14th district of Los Angeles and works on various issues affecting the city and its residents.

De León's tenure on the Los Angeles City Council has been marked by his dedication to addressing the needs of his constituents and advocating for progressive policies. He has been actively involved in initiatives related to affordable housing, homelessness, and public safety.

One of de León's primary focuses has been tackling the city's homelessness crisis. He has worked to expand access to shelter and services for individuals experiencing homelessness while also pushing for long-term solutions to address the root causes of homelessness. De León has supported measures to increase affordable housing options and has sought to improve coordination between city agencies and community organizations in addressing the issue.

Public safety has also been a significant area of concern for de León. He has championed efforts to enhance community policing strategies and improve relations between law enforcement and the communities they serve. De León has advocated for investments in community-based programs and initiatives that prioritize proactive and preventive approaches to public safety.

Additionally, de León has been committed to addressing environmental and climate-related issues in Los Angeles. He has worked on policies to promote renewable energy, reduce pollution, and enhance sustainability efforts. De León has emphasized the importance of transitioning to a clean energy economy and has supported initiatives that promote environmental justice.

As a council member, de León has brought his experience in state and national politics to his work at the local level. He continues to be an influential figure in shaping policies and advocating for the needs of his district and the broader Los Angeles community.

Kevin de León's 2022 Los Angeles Mayoral Bid was an unsuccessful campaign in which he competed against Karen Bass and Rick Caruso. Despite his efforts, de León came in third place in the election, failing to advance to the runoff stage.

Throughout his campaign, de León presented himself as a progressive candidate with a focus on addressing the pressing issues facing Los Angeles. He emphasized his experience in state politics, particularly his time in the California State Senate, and sought to bring his advocacy for social and environmental justice to the mayoral role.

During the campaign, de León received endorsements from Representatives Jimmy Gomez and Lou Correa, two influential figures within the Democratic Party. Their support highlighted de León's standing among fellow politicians and his commitment to advancing progressive policies.

Despite his notable endorsements and experience, de León was unable to secure enough votes to move forward to the runoff stage. The runoff eventually took place between Karen Bass and Rick Caruso, with Bass emerging as the winner of the mayoral race.

In a departure from endorsing either candidate in the runoff, de León decided not to endorse any candidate for the mayoral position. While he did not secure the mayoral seat himself, his campaign contributed to the broader political discourse in Los Angeles and brought attention to important issues facing the city.

Although his bid for mayor was ultimately unsuccessful, de León remains an active figure in Los Angeles politics and continues to advocate for progressive policies and social and environmental justice.

Puberty blockers

Sometimes a person's body is wrong for their gender identity. They may have male sex organs but feel that they are a female, or they may have female sex organs but identify as male. Young people with "wrong" bodies are often called transgender youth. 

Medical operations by doctors and hormone pills can change the body, but those operations are not done on young people. Instead, doctors can give drugs that slow down or stop puberty so the person has more time to decide what to do. Also, it should lower the number of transgender young people who kill themselves. That sometimes happens because they are bullied by other people, or because they feel very unhappy having their body become an adult body that they do not want because they feel it is the wrong body. As of 2023, some states in the United States say doctors cannot give these drugs to young people. The talk about these drugs has become very political. 

These drugs were usually made for other reasons, such as stopping cancer. These drugs can also be used if a child starts puberty at a very early age, such as 7 or 8. The name for that situation is "precocious puberty." Going through puberty too early creates medical and psychological problems. The person might not grow as tall as they could. They might feel very different from their friends and other children in school. Girls who go through puberty early have a bigger chance of being sexually assaulted. They also have a bigger chance of becoming pregnant while still a young teenager. There is a bigger chance that later in life they might get a cancer such as breast cancer, because there is a higher risk associated with the number of years the woman had between puberty (usually defined as menarche for studies) and the first time she has a baby. One of the drugs that can be given to people with boy bodies is called Lupron Depot. It works by causing a very big drop in testosterone levels. The drugs to block or slow puberty can be given with a needle in the leg, or sometimes the shoulder. In a young person with a boy body, for some drugs, the needle is put in a testicle. Sometimes the drugs are in a patch that is under the skin of an upper arm. The patch is usually changed once a year. There is a chance that unwanted things could happen because of these drugs. These things are called side effects. There are some short term side effects, most of which are not huge problems for most people getting the drugs. The more important thing is that these drugs might have long-term effects on:

With drugs involving body chemicals called hormones that regulate things like growth, there might be a slight chance of increasing cancer risk, even though these drugs are often used as anticancer drugs.

The use of puberty blockers in transgender youth is supported by 12 major American medical associations, including the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Endocrine Society the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Psychiatric Association, the Pediatric Endocrine Society, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Physicians, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Osteopathic Association, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American Nurses Association, four Australian medical associations, and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health.

The talk about these drugs has become very political. People who do not want puberty blockers used for young people think it is better to let the young person's body go through puberty, even though that will permanently change their body. Some of them have religious reasons. They may believe that people should not interfere with how a human body was made because they believe it was made by God. These people also say the child might just be imagining the problem or might change how they feel about their gender identity when they are older. People who oppose transgender rights or who hate or are afraid of transgender people are often called transphobic. People who do not want puberty blockers used for transgender youth are often classified as social conservatives if they have many opinions that are not modern.

The goal of Connected Fashion is to create products, by making a digital twin of the physical object. This is very similar to Digital Fashion and includes many features of this trend.

The growth of blockchain technology and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) has played a big part in creating Connected Fashion.

The internet made shopping very easy, and social media apps led to a big increase in the number of influencers. But, the way customers and brands interacted was still mostly one-sided. Customers didn't have a real way to be a part of their favorite brands.

NFT technology lets people create and own unique tokens. In this case, these tokens can represent items that people have bought. They can be used in many ways, like getting into exclusive groups, voting and making decisions, and even keeping track of an item's history. Plus, since NFTs can show who owns something, they can be used to prove that a high-end item is real and not fake. This gives the owner a digital proof that they own the real item.

As technology has gotten better and more things are done online, the idea of having an online identity or an online brand has become more important. Connected Fashion also lets customers prove that they own certain items online and include these items in their online identity and virtual worlds.

Connected Fashion can share more details about where an item comes from and how it was made. The item could have a QR code or something similar that contains information about it. This is very important for ethical or slow fashion.

High-end fashion often has problems with fakes and copies. Connected Fashion can be used as proof of ownership and to show that an item is real and not fake. This is really helpful for influencers and fashion bloggers who want to prove that they own real items. It's also useful for markets where people buy used items and want to know if they are real.

Connected Fashion helps solve the problem of people feeling a disconnect between their real-world fashion and branding and their online identity.

Connected Fashion can also give owners access to special experiences. The NFT of the item can work like a passport, giving the owner access to exclusive events.

Brands and members of the community can put proposals up for a vote. This doesn't just give customers a voice, but it also lets brands get immediate and provable feedback from their community.

Gucci was the first luxury clothing brand to launch an NFT series with the NFT Aria collection which launched at Christie's in June 2022 for $25,000 to commemorate its 100th anniversary. Proceeds from the sale were donated to UNICEF USA.

Also in 2022, Nike launched a digital collection of sports shoes called “Cryptokicks”.

Balmain used NFTs during the Paris Fashion Week F/W 2022 for gated membership experiences, giving holders access to exclusive events and perks.

Connected Fashion began to develop in 2023, with the blockchain company ChromaWay pioneering the term and acquiring clothing brand BLK DNM.

In March 2023, Balmain has released a limited edition NFT sneaker based on its Unicorn shoe line, each with a pair of matching limited edition sneakers from the real world.

Information design

Information design is about presenting information in a way that is easy to understand and efficient. It focuses on effective communication rather than just making things look attractive. It is closely related to graphic design and data visualization and is often taught in design courses.

The term "information design" emerged in the 1970s and gained recognition through publications and organizations dedicated to the field. It involves organizing and structuring information for specific audiences. It can be applied on different scales, from organizing large manuals to designing individual pages. Information design also overlaps with information architecture, which focuses on organizing and structuring information systems.

Early examples of information design include William Playfair's charts on trade, John Snow's maps of a cholera outbreak, and Charles Joseph Minard's diagram of Napoleon's campaign. These examples effectively conveyed information visually and are considered important milestones in the field.

In simple terms, information design helps us present information in a clear and organized way so that it is easy to understand. It involves organizing content, choosing the right visuals, and creating a structure that makes sense to the intended audience. Information design has a long history and has played a significant role in visualizing data and telling stories effectively.

Malabar gliding frog

The Malabar flying frog, Malabar gliding frog, or flying frog ("Rhacophorus malabaricus") is a frog. It lives in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Phillippines.

Scientists sometimes wonder if a frog is "R. malabaricus" or another species, "R. pseudomalabaricus". They say one good way to tell these two frogs apart is to look at where the frog lives: "R. pseudomalabaricus" lives high than 955 meters above sea level. If the frog is close to sea level, it is probably "R. malabaricus", and if it is high up in the hills, it is probably "R. pseudomalabaricus".

Co-amoxiclav

Co-amoxiclav is an antibiotic that is also known as Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. It is used to treat bacterial infections such as pneumonia, animal bites, urinary tract infections. The antibiotic is also used in veterinary practices and is commonly given to farm animals and pets against similar infections. It's brand name in the UK is Augmentin and is only available on prescription.

Because the antibiotic is used widely amongst humans and animals, bacterial resistance to this antibiotic is growing.

Co-amoxiclav was identified in 1972 by a group of scientists in Beecham (now GlaxoSmithKline). It was launched as Augmentin in the UK in 1981 and it is a combination of clavulanic acid and Amoxicillin. It is now on the World Health Organisation's list of Essential Medicines meaning it is very important in modern medicine.

Mercedes-Benz A-Class

The Mercedes-Benz A-Class is a small luxury car made by the luxury car brand Mercedes-Benz. 

It is the brand's smallest car, below the B-Class. Since 2018, there has been a sedan option, made for small sedan buyers. The 1st gen is codenamed W168, and started in 1997 the 2nd gen, codenamed W169, started in 2004, the 3rd gen, codenamed W176, started in 2012, and the 4th gen, codenamed W177, with a sedan codenamed V177, started in 2018.

In 1994, Mercedes had confirmed a new small car would be made, was first seen in 1996, and was released in 1997 at a motor show in Frankfurt, Germany. Although it is a small subcompact car, it is large and practical inside, like a mid-size car. It was designed by Steve Mattin, who also designed the ML-Class, and the GL-Class. It is unusual for Mercedes to make a front-wheel drive hatchback with a short, but tall body. Its code name is W168.

In between 1997-2004, 1.1 million units were produced, but the problem is that, Daimler had lost €1,440 making each unit.

In early 2001, the A-Class had gotten a change, adding new front and back.

The new A-Class' codename is W169 and it is constructed with high-strength steel alloys, and has increased cargo capacity by 15 percent, compared to the W168 A-Class. Unlike the previous, or next generation, this generation of A-Class had a 3-door and 5-door option. While the 5-door is codenamed W169, the 3-door is codenamed 'C169'.

In 2008, the A-Class had gotten a change, meaning it had gotten longer, received longer doors, and has new headlights and taillights.

The new A-Class is completely different from the 2 previous generations. Unlike the previous 2, who used the W168 and W169 model codes, the new W176 has a larger model code. The new car has grown 400 mm (0.4 m) longer. It has new headlights, taillights, body style, refreshed interior, cooler rear lights and front lights, now making it closer to the small luxury car segment and daytime running lights.

The new A-Class is more expressive than the previous models, directly competes with the Audi A3 and BMW 1 Series, as they are all German luxury small family cars.
In 2015, the A-Class had gotten a change for 2016, adding bolder, restyled headllights, and better technology.

The new A-Class is the fourth generation of the Mercedes-Benz A-Class, the successor of the W176. Its codename is W177, and features multiple design cues from the previous A-Class.

The V177 is a sedan version of the W177 hatchback. A longer version is also only sold in China, codenamed Z177.

Hazing

Hazing (American English), initiation, beasting (British English), bastardisation (Australian English), or ragging (South Asian English) means making new people in a group do dangerous, stupid, or unpleasant things (activities.) These are things that humiliate, embarrass, degrade, or endanger someone even if the person agrees to do them. Hazing is a type of bullying. Sex acts, drinking too much alcohol or eating too much food are often part of hazing. An illegal sex act that sometimes happens is that several or many young men (one after another) rape (have sex with someone without the person's agreement or consent.) Usually the person raped is a woman who is drunk, drugged, or being held down. Sometimes gross or disgusting things are done to new people in the group. An example is holding the new person's head in a garbage can or giving the person a swirly. For gangs, committing a murder is sometimes a thing new members are made to do. For gangs, it is not called hazing. It is called an initiation rite.

Hazing happens in many different types of social groups, including schools, colleges, universities, sports teams, cliques (groups of students who others consider popular or special), military units, prisons, gangs, fraternities and sororities, and workplaces. The types of workplaces where hazing is common are usually jobs like construction or factory jobs more than office jobs, although "team building" activities at offices can be very close to hazing.

Hazing is often against rules, but teachers or bosses ignore it ("look the other way") and say they did not see it happen.

Sometimes people die because of hazing. For example, a student might drink too much alcohol and fall off a roof.

Required physical training such as being forced to run a long distance or do a lot of push-ups in an army is not called hazing.

Cephalosporins

Cephalosporins are a type of group of antibiotics, which come from a fungus of the genus Acremonium. Since their discovery, they have been frequently used in medicine as an effective treatment for a wide range of bacterial infections.

Cephalosporins were first developed from a fungus, "Cephalosporin acremonium", found in 1945.

Giuseppe Brotzu, a pharmacologist working in Cagliari, Italy, found the fungus while trying to make a map of places affected by the disease typhoid fever. This fungus appeared in sewage water from locations where fewer people were becoming ill from the disease.

Scientists at the University of Oxford were able to extract molecules from the fungus, to research and develop the first generation of these antibiotics during the late 1940s and the 1950s. These first became commercially available in 1964.

The first cephalosporins antibiotics were produced from a molecule called 'cephalosporin C', obtained from the "Cephalosporin acremonium" fungus. The molecule consists of two rings, each with a chain.

Second-generation cephalosporins were developed from first-generation cephalosporins, because of a need for more effective treatments against the increasing number of bacteria developing resistance to other antibiotics.

Third-generation cephalosporins are improved versions of the second-generation, as they are broad-spectrum antibiotics. Broad-spectrum antibiotics can be used against bacteria with or without protective membranes.

Cephalosporins work by attaching themselves to specific enzymes after the bacteria divide and duplicate. These enzymes are known as 'penicillin binding proteins' and are responsible for repairing the cell wall of bacteria. This leaves a gap in the bacterial cell wall, and results in the osmotic pressure inside a bacterium to build up. Bacteria can no longer survive if the osmotic pressure becomes too high.

Cephalosporins are an effective treatment against bacteria which are Gram-positive. Some examples of Gram-positive bacterial infections are meningitis and pneumonia. Third-generation cephalosporins play an important role in treating such illnesses.

From the 1960s to the 1990s, cephalosporins played a particularly significant role in US hospitals. They were used to treat patients affected by bacteria infections after operations, and this rate of infection was cut down by over 50%.

Healthcare in New Zealand

The public healthcare system in New Zealand was set up by the Social Security Act 1938, but since the 1980s there has been more private health insurance. In 2012, New Zealand spent 8.7% of GDP on health care, or US$3,929 per person. About 77% was government expenditure.

20 district health boards were set up in January 2001. They were supposed to improve the health outcomes of Māori. They were closed in 2022 by the Pae Ora Act which set up Health New Zealand and the Māori Health Authority.

In 2023 Health New Zealand started to use an ‘equity adjuster score’ for planned surgery. This prioritises patients according to clinical priority, time spent on the waitlist, their geographic location (isolation), economic situation, and ethnicity. Māori and Pasifika are the highest ranked ethnicities. 

There were substantial delays in diagnosis and treatment because of severe workforce shortages. The performance of public hospitals deteriorated after the 2000s.

History of Manchester

Manchester was the first city to industrialise, because of the Industrial Revolution. It became the main place for making cloth and fabric. During the 19th century it had the nickname Cottonopolis, because it had so many cotton mills. The middle of Manchester is important because of its network of canals and mills built during its 19th-century development.
In the late 18th century, Manchester was much smaller than it is today with about 40,000 people living there. This changed at the start of the Industrial Revolution. During this time, there were revolts about the living conditions for workers. The most well known of these revolts was the Peterloo Massacre. Fifteen to twenty people were killed during the Peterloo Massacre and hundreds of other people were hurt. In 1780, Richard Arkwright built the first cotton mill in the area.

Later in the 1800s, Manchester became most important cotton town in the world. It was also the first 'industrialised' city, meaning that it was the first city to have a big amount of industry in it. Only a small amount of cloth is still made in the city and the trade has mainly stopped. This left a big number of old buildings from that time including the Town Hall, Free Trade Hall and Central Library and left a lot of other buildings empty.

The Manchester Ship Canal was created by the digging of canals in the rivers Irwell and Mersey for from Salford to the Mersey estuary. This let ocean going ships sail into the Port of Manchester.

The county of Greater Manchester was made in 1974. The county was made from cities and towns in southern Lancashire and northern Cheshire (the two main areas which make up Greater Manchester), and some mainly rural districts of Derbyshire and Yorkshire.

In 1996, the Irish Republican Army put a bomb in a truck in the centre of the city. Nobody was killed, but it did a lot of damage.

On 22 May 2017, a bombing occurred at the Manchester Arena which killed 22 people and injured 55. It was a suicide bombing.

Thames Water

Thames Water Utilities Ltd, known as Thames Water, is a large private utility company. It supplies water and waste water treatment in most of Greater London, Luton, the Thames Valley, Surrey, Gloucestershire, north Wiltshire, far west Kent, and some other parts of England.

It was started in 1989 during privatisation of the water industry in England and Wales. The water is mostly sourced from the Thames as well as some other rivers and boreholes.

It is the biggest water and wastewater services company in the United Kingdom. It runs the Thames Water Ring Main around London, one of Europe's largest wastewater treatment works and the UK's first large-scale desalination plant—both at Beckton in east London—and the £4.2 billion Thames Tideway sewer currently under construction. It supplies 2.5 billion litres (550 million imperial gallons) of drinking water and treats 4.6 billion litres (1,000 million imperial gallons) of wastewater a day. It serves a population of 15.5 million people—about a quarter of the UK population—but its ageing infrastructure often leaks and causes pollution.

The New River was started in 1604 by Edmund Colthurst to carry fresh water from Hertfordshire into London. The business of the New River was taken over by the New River Company, officially founded by royal charter in 1619. This developed into the Thames Conservancy which started in 1857 when Joseph Bazalgette started building the London sewers.

Thames Water plc was bought by the German utility company RWE in 2001. They sold it for £8 billion to Kemble Water Holdings Ltd in 2006. This is owned by the Australian Macquarie Group. In 2017, Macquarie Group sold it to the Canadian pensions group OMERS and the Kuwait Investment Authority. In 2022 it was losing money with current debt amounting to 80% of the value of the business. It was the most heavily indebted of England and Wales' water companies. This problem was seen by the regulator Ofwat in December 2022 and there were discussions about a possible collapse and state bail-out. 

In June 2018 regulators made Thames Water pay £65 million to customers among other problems because they failed to fix leaks. In June 2023 leak levels were at their highest for five years. It was estimated to be losing a day. In July 2023 it was fined £3.3 million after it discharged millions of litres of undiluted sewage into the Gatwick Stream in Sussex and River Mole in Surrey.

Prince Alexander was born on 14 August 1876 to King Milan I and Natalie of Serbia. In 1889, King Milan abdicated and proclaimed Alexander as the King but under a regency until he was 18.

At the age of 16, Alexander dismissed the regents and their government and took authority into his own hands. In May 1894 King Alexander arbitrarily abolished his father's liberal constitution and restored the conservative one of 1869. He also made Milan the commander-in-chief of the military.

In the summer of 1900, King Alexander married Draga Mašin so that he could produce an heir. Soon after, a conspiracy began among a group of Army officials and politicians aiming to replace King Alexander with Prince Peter of the Karađorđević dynasty, the rivals of Alexander's family.

On 11 June, 1903 the conspirators invaded King Alexander's palace and killed him and the Queen.

Alexander is the only child of King Peter II and his wife, Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark. He was the crown prince of Yugoslavia for the first four-and-a-half months of his life, until the monarchy was abolished. 

Born and raised in the United Kingdom, he enjoys close relationships with his relatives in the British royal family. His godparents were King George VI and his daughter, the then-Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II). 

Through his father, Alexander is a direct descendant of Queen Victoria, through his great-great-grandfather Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Victoria's second eldest son. Maternally, he is also a direct descendant of Queen Victoria, through his great-great-grandmother Victoria, German Empress, Victoria's eldest daughter. 

Alexander is known for his humanitarian work. He is also known for supporting the idea that Serbia should become a monarchy again, with himself as the king. Numerous political parties also support this idea, as does the Serbian Orthodox Church. Public surveys in Serbia show that many people would also support the monarchy.

The highlight of his international career was undoubtedly the 1950 World Cup in Brazil. Schiaffino was Uruguay's best player at the World Cup alongside his Penarol teammates Alcides Ghiggia and Óscar Míguez. The trio led the team to the decisive match against Brazil. The Brazilians took the lead but Schiaffino equalized in the 66th minute and Ghiggia scored the 2-1 winner in the 79th minute. With this historic victory for Uruguay in the famous Maracanã stadium, Uruguay were football world champions for the second time.

Four years later, at the 1954 FIFA World Cup in Switzerland, Schiaffino came with Uruguay to the semifinals against Hungary. After being 2-0 behind, his team fought back a 2-2, but then had to give up the game with 4-2. On July 3, 1954, Uruguay lost 3-1 to Austria in the third-place match. This was also the last of his 21 international appearances in the Celeste, in which he scored a total of 8 goals. There are also two other national team appearances against Argentina (December 29, 1945 and December 5, 1948), which are not counted as full international matches.

From 1954 to 1958 he played for the Italy national football team, but only made four appearances for his parents' home country.

Schiaffino returned to Montevideo and embarked on a brief coaching career. In 1974 he was entrusted with the Uruguayan national team, with which he participated in the Copa América the following year. Shortly afterwards he also coached the Peñarol youth team until 1976. However, he did not have good results, and decided to devote himself solely to entrepreneurial activity.

Schiaffino died on 13 November 2002. His remains are buried at the Cementerio del Buceo, Montevideo.

Healthcare in Germany

Germany has a health care system paid for partly by statutory health insurance ("Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung") and partly by private health insurance ("Private Krankenversicherung").

Healthcare in Switzerland

Healthcare in Switzerland covers everyone. It is regulated by the "Swiss Federal Law on Health Insurance". It is not run by the government. Private health insurance is compulsory for everyone who lives in Switzerland (within three months of moving in or being born in the country). People have to pay part of the cost of their treatment. Insurers have to offer basic insurance to everyone, whatever their age or medical condition. Some people get help from the government to pay. 

There are both public and privately owned hospitals. Some of the private hospitals are subsidised by the government. People in hospital have to pay £12 a day. 

Switzerland spends more on healthcare per person than any country apart from the USA. 26% of total health spending comes directly from the patients.

List of Mercedes-Benz trucks

The following is a list of trucks produced by Mercedes-Benz.

Mercedes-Benz semitrailer tractor family was developed from Mercedes-Benz Lo2000-Lo3750 trucks.

LG means Lastwagen Gelandewagen (off-road truck). LR means Lastwagen Raupenfahrzeug (caterpillar truck).

Mercedes-Benz LG65/2 and LG65/4 were experimental models.

The immediate post-war era was marked by rebuilding the trucking industry. In the mid-fifties, however, Germany's first federal transport minister Hans-Christoph Seebohm enacted a number of laws promoting the Bundesbahn at the expense of the trucking industry. Severe weight and dimension restrictions were particularly harmful to export-dependent Mercedes-Benz, as they had to develop duplicate truck lineups - one for export, and one for the restricted German market. These restrictions were eased beginning in 1960, leaving Mercedes-Benz free to focus their efforts on a unified lineup once again.

The nomenclature: In 1954 the old four-digit model series designation (indicated the payload in kilograms), was replaced by a three-digit model series designation, which basically corresponded to Mercedes-Benz internal model designations (in-house design codes). This nomenclature have been used for almost 10 years, from 1954 till 1963.

A cab-over-engine versions of most of the trucks were also available from 1954. For example, LP4500 (1954) and LP315 (1955). However, there was only a single model which existed only as a cab-over-engine version, "the Millipede" (LP 333). 
Cab-over-engine versions (LP) of most of the trucks were also available; the cabins were built by Wackenhut until the introduction of the "cubic" cab LP-series.

The nomenclature: In 1963 for simplification a new index system was introduced: a four-digit model series designation, where the first one or two first digits indicate the rounded GVW in tones, and the last two figures - the engine power to tens of horsepower. This index system is in use until now.

LP versions - see below.
The cab-over-engine versions (LP) of most of the trucks were also available.

LP versions - see below.


2013

Mercedes-Benz internal model designations (in-house design codes) were always more or less just consecutively allocated design codes devoid of any deeper meaning. For the passenger cars they are so-called W-numbers, from German word Wagen (=car). For example, W202 is C-class, W220 is S-class etc. This system started in 1926 and the numbers are consecutive continued till now. From the 1970s letter W is used for saloons, while the other letters have been add for the different body types (f.e. W212 is E-class saloon, V212 is E-class limousine, S212 is E-class estate etc.). For the commercial vehicles for early decades letter L was used instead of letter W (German word Lastwagen means a truck). From the 1950s letter L was omitted, resulting in just 3 numbers code. Sometimes word Baumuster (model) or Baureihe (model line) was used, like Baumuster 352 (or in short BM352) or Baureihe 352 (in short BR.352). So, basically, with or without a letter(s) in front, there is unique 3-number code, which determine every Mercedes-Benz car. As for the trucks, 300-i.e. numbers were used till the 1980s to code Mercedes commercial vehicles, 600-i.e. numbers were used in the 1980s and 1990s, and 900-i.e. numbers have been used from the introduction of Sprinter (1995) and Actros (1996).

In 2011 the internal model designations system was a little bit reorganized:


For example: 963403 means Commercial Actros/Antos concrete mixer On-road vehicle, 4x2 18t

2023 French riots

Riots began in France on 27 June 2023 after the killing of Nahel Merzouk by a police officer in Nanterre. Merzouk was a 17-year-old French youth of Moroccan and Algerian descent who worked as a pizza delivery boy. He was driving a car and was stopped after being chased. He was shot at close range in the car. A video of the shooting was seen by many people. The traffic police officer said “I’m going to lodge a bullet in your head.” What the video showed was not what the police said had happened. The police officer was arrested. 

French President Emmanuel Macron declared the incident "inexcusable and unforgivable", adding that it "moved the entire nation". 

Nahel's mother called for a "White March" in memory of her son in Nanterre. In Nanterre rioters threw things at police, let off fireworks, and set cars, bus shelters, rubbish bins, and a school on fire on 27 June after they had seen the video. From 28 June to 3 July there were riots all over Paris and in many other French cities. There were demonstrations in Belgium and in most of the overseas departments of France. 

30 June, the two largest police unions, Alliance Police nationale and the UNSA union, released a statement declaring they were “at war” with “vermin” and “savage hordes” and threaten politicians openly: ″Tomorrow we will be in the resistance and the government should be aware of that.″.

Buying fireworks for Bastille Day was banned as a result of the riots. 

Immigrants in France are poorer than people born in the country. More of them are unemployed. Black people in Paris are six times more likely to be stopped by the police than white people. Immigrant communities are concentrated in the "banlieues", estates full of poor people. French law says that it is not allowed to collect information about people's race. Racial tension in France seems to be worse than in other developed countries and commentators think that is why the riots happened.

Plastic bag ban

Thin plastic bags are commonly available at retail stores. Many stores make them available for free. These bags have a number of problems though: In many cases, they are only used once. Like other plastic, they take a long time to decay. In the 21st century there have been ideas to replace these bags with other bags, or to make a tax apply to these bags. This is known as plastic bag ban, or plastic bag charge. These bags are commonly made of low-density polyethylene. For a long time, they were considered an easy way for transporting goods, both cheap, and hygienic. The problems that are associated with these bags are that non-renewable resources (such as crude oil, gas and coal) are used to produce them. Disposing them is also problematic, very often they are simply thown away. Shops have started introducing reusable shopping bags. 

Different governments have banned the sale of these bags, or they put a tax on their sale. Bangladesh was the first country to do this, in 2002; it banned these bags completely. Between 2010 and 2019, the number of public policies intended to phase out plastic carryout bags tripled. As of 2022, bans have been introduced in 99 countries and 32 countries have introduced a charge per bag.

Plastic bags cause many ecological and environmental problems. The most general issue with plastic bags is the amount of waste produced. Many plastic bags end up on streets and pollute major water sources, rivers, and streams. 

Even when they are disposed properly, they take many years to decompose. This generates a lot of garbage. In many cases, they are simply thrown away. This will pollute waterways. Thin plastic bags are in the oceans, where they affect the ecosystem of marine creatures. Several microbial species colonize on plastic particles making them more harmful. Plastic particles driven by winds form garbage patches in the oceans. The UN estimates that there will be more plastics than fish in the oceans by 2050 unless countries come up with urgent measures to promote efficient production, use and waste management of plastics throughout their life cycles.

Plastic bags contribute to global warming. When they are exposed to the sun, they release two greenhouse gases, methane and ethylene. Because they are thin, they break down more easily than other forms of plastics. At the end of a 212-day trial, emissions have been recorded at 5.8 nmol g-1 d-1 of methane, 14.5 nmol g-1 d-1 of ethylene, 3.9 nmol g-1 d-1 of ethane and 9.7 nmol g-1 d-1 of propylene.

The bags cause direct harm to wildlife. Animals may be caught in the debris. As they cannot get away, they may either starve, or drown, when the debris is washed into the sea. Many animals cannot distinguish the small plastic pieces from food, and eat them. The debris then clog the animals' intestines, and may lead to the animal slowly starving. Plastic bags can block drains, trap birds and kill livestock. The World Wide Fund for Nature has estimated that over 100,000 whales, seals, and turtles die every year as a result of eating or being trapped by plastic bags. It is very common across Africa to have sewers and drain systems clogged by bags which cause malaria due to the increased population of mosquitoes that live on the flooded sewers. The term "white pollution" has been coined in China to describe the local and global effects of discarded plastic bags upon the environment.

Lightweight plastic bags break down by polymer degradation. Any toxic additives they contain will be released into the environment. Many of those toxins directly affect the endocrine systems of organisms, which control almost every cell in the body. Research shows the average operating "lifespan" of a plastic bag to be approximately 20 years.

Plastic bags dumped in the Pacific Ocean can end up in the Great Pacific garbage patch. 80% of the plastic waste comes from land; the rest comes from oil platforms and ships. This can be eaten by marine animals, and block their breathing passages and digestive systems. Plastic bags not only add to the Great Pacific garbage patch, they can be washed ashore around the world.

The two most popular methods of phasing out lightweight plastic bags are charges and bans. The charge strategy has the same results as a plastic bag ban; it also has benefit of creating a new revenue source. The plastic bag charge method also protects consumer choice, which the ban does not.

Plastic bags can also be recycled. The problem with recycling is that as of 2023, only 5% of plastic bags make it to recycling facilities. Even when bags are brought to recycling facilities, they often fly out of the bins or recycling trucks and end up as litter on the streets. Different bags are made from different yet similar types of plastics. Recycling facilities can often only recycle one kind of bag. Recycling different types will make recycling more expensive. 

Plastic bag bans have also been criticised. Such bans can lead to larger black markets in plastic bags. Studies show that plastic bag bans can shift people away from using thin plastic bags, but it can also increase the use of unregulated single use paper bags or unregulated thicker plastic bags in areas where these are provided for free. The bans can also lead to more trash bags being sold, because people can no longer reuse their old grocery bags for things like lining small trash cans..

Sometimes, the production of non-plastic bags can emit more greenhouse gases, than plastic bags. Some alternatives to plastic bags would need to be reused over a hundred times to make them more environmentally friendly than plastic bags. They are also viewed as less sanitary than plastic because they can bring germs from outside the store to high contact volume surfaces like carts and check out stands.

Normative ethics

Normative ethics is a branch of ethics, that looks to establish norms of how people ought to behave, and act in certain situations. It also looks at how norms and values are formed in a society. It looks at what is good, and right in a moral sense.

Philiospohers such as Aristotle and Saint Thomas Aquinas looked at the question what virtue really is; from this a branch called virtue ethics develped. 

People like Immanuel Kant, with his categorical imperative, John Rawls with his contractualism, or John Locke with his theory of natural rights are seen as advocating deontological ethics today.

Utilitarianism says that an action is right, if it makes more people happy. 

These are common branches of normative ethics.

Edwin Chadwick

Sir Edwin Chadwick (24 January 1800 – 6 July 1890) was an English social reformer who led the reform of the Poor Laws in England. He was also a leader in public health. He was a follower of the Utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham and a friend of John Stuart Mill.

He was born on 24 January 1800 in Longsight, Manchester and moved to London when he was 10. He was a member of the Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws 1832. 

After a serious outbreak of typhus in 1838, he convinced the Poor Law Board that an enquiry was required. The work was done by his friends who were doctors and he published it as "Report on The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain" in 1842. A lot of people bought it. It said that better water supplies and a drainage system to remove waste, would stop so many people dying. Evidence given by Dr Dyce Guthrie convinced Chadwick that every house should have a permanent water supply, rather than the intermittent supplies from standpipes that many poor people had to use. The report led to the Public Health Act 1848, which was the first time the British government took responsibility for the health of its citizens.

Public Health Act 1848

The Public Health Act 1848 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It was the first time the government had tried to improve the health of the people. Edwin Chadwick had pushed for it after his reports on the condition of the working classes. It did not cover the City of London and some other parts of London.

It put the supply of water; sewerage; drainage; cleansing; paving, and environmental health regulation in England and Wales under a single local body. The General Board of Health was in charge, and local boards of health could be set up, either by local people or by the General Board. The General Board did not have money. The local boards could get money from rates. Sunderland was one of the first places to set up a local board.


Free energy principle

The Free Energy Principle is a scientific concept that explains how living things interact with their environment. It says our brains try to avoid surprises and stay in control. Our brains make predictions about what will happen based on past experiences. When reality matches our predictions, everything is fine, but when something unexpected occurs, our brains need to update their predictions and take action to reduce the surprise. To do this, our brains gather information from our senses and compare it to their predictions. If there's a difference, the brain sends signals to our body to make adjustments. This helps us stay to adapt to new situations, learn from experiences, and optimize their interactions with the world.

Robert Stephenson

Robert Stephenson (16 October 1803 – 12 October 1859) was an English civil engineer and designer of locomotives. The only son of George Stephenson, the "Father of Railways", he built on the achievements of his father. Robert has been called the greatest engineer of the 19th century.

One of his first jobs was to to survey the route of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. 

By 1850 he had been involved in building a third of the country's railway system. He designed the High Level Bridge and Royal Border Bridge on the East Coast Main Line. With Eaton Hodgkinson and William Fairbairn he developed wrought-iron tubular bridges, such as the Britannia Bridge in Wales, a design he would later use for the Victoria Bridge in Montreal, for many years the longest bridge in the world. He eventually worked on 160 commissions from 60 companies, building railways in other countries such as Belgium, Norway, Egypt and France. 

Liverpool and Manchester Railway

The Liverpool and Manchester Railway was the first inter-city railway in the world. It opened on 15 September 1830 between the Lancashire cities of Liverpool and Manchester. It was also the first railway to only have locomotives driven by steam power, with no horse-drawn traffic permitted at any time; the first to be entirely double track; the first to have a true signalling system; the first to be fully timetabled; and the first to carry mail.

It was designed and built by George Stephenson. It made money, and influenced the development of railways across Britain in the 1830s.

Kōbō Abe

He was born in Kita, Tokyo, Japan and grew up in Mukden (Shenyang), Manchuria. He studied at Seijo High School before returning to Manchuria. Abe later studied medicine at the Tokyo Imperial University (University of Tokyo). There, he began writing novellas and short stories.

His first published novel was "Owarishi michi no shirube ni" (""The Road Sign at the End of the Street"") in 1948. He won the Akutagawa Prize in 1951 for the short story collection "The Crime of S. Karuma."

Abe's first internationally known work was "The Woman in the Dunes." This was a novel he published in 1962. The novel won the Yomiuri Prize that same year. A movie based on the novel by Hiroshi Teshigahara was made in 1964.

His next award-winning work was "Friends." This was a play published in 1967. It won the Tanizaki Prize the same year.

Font del gat (water trough)

The Font del Gat or Font de Sant Agustí Vell is a Gothic fountain (reconstructed) located in the Barri de Ribera of Barcelona . It is on the ground floor of the house whose main facade faces Plaça de Sant Agustí Vell and is on the corner of Carders and Tantarantana streets (below which the Rec Comtal used to feed the fountain). 

It is a very significant fountain of the city, since the main use was as a water trough for the horses of the carriages that entered to Barcelona through the Portal Nou.

The first preserved vestiges of fountains located in roads or public buildings come from the Middle Ages, when the city was part of the Crown of Aragon . It was an important maritime and commercial axis of the Mediterranean Sea . The city area grew from the primitive urban core - what is today the Barri Gòtic - and in the 14th century the Raval neighborhood emerged. Barcelona then had around 25,000 inhabitants. 

In this period, several fountains were created throughout the city, to ensure a regular supply to the population. Just as the industrial use of water was ensured with the Rec Comtal and the channeling of water from Montjuïc to the Pla de la Boqueria, domestic consumption was mainly carried out through wells, which depended on rainfall and they caused supply shortages in times of drought. Thus, at this time several fountains were opened, most of them eminently utilitarian in nature, and therefore there was not much room for artistic creation.

Until the beginning of the last century, the water came out of a cat's head, which is why it was called Font del Gat, to distinguish it from the one on the other side of the square (more modern Canaletes style ). Unfortunately this original fountain disappeared when the council demolished the house in 1996 to build social housings. In the place where the fountain was, they left an Office of La Caixa d'Estalvis. After a while, when the residents claimed it, the city council made a replica (with three fountains as seen in the photo), since they could not find the stones of the original fountain.

Resistentialism

Resistentialism is a joke theory about objects intentionally being mean to humans. Objects like lost keys, broken printers, or bouncing balls are said to dislike us. It is said to be a battle between humans and objects causing small troubles. The idea was named "Resistentialism" in 1948 by writer Paul Jennings. It is a playful imitation of existentialism, with a slogan saying "Things are against us."

The hostile nature of the universe has always been a topic of discussion throughout history. It has been observed in laws like Murphy's law, Finagle's law, and Sod's law.

Oil shale

Oil shale is a sedimentary rock which can be squeezed to get oil out if it. The part which has oil in it is called kerogen. There's a great deal of it, and the oil is said to be "oil in place". It is planned as a source of oil after regular oil wells dry up.

So far only Estonia and China have got big oil shale industries, but other countries plan to develop it. The forests of ferns and trees which originally made the oil were very widespread on Earth, so in theory many other countries have oil-bearing land.

Alternatively, there are people who believe that hydrocarbons are not biogenic. They think hydrocarbons were formed in space and delivered to planets like Earth ready-formed. Although this might seem far-fetched, it has been suggested by some notable scientists, such as Thomas Gold.

Biafra

Biafra, officially called the Republic of Biafra, was a break-away state in West Africa. It was created on 30 May 1967 by the Eastern Region governor C. Odumegwu Ojukwu. It claimed the land of the Eastern Region of Nigeria. The country was mainly populated by the Igbo people.

Biafra was officially recognised by Gabon, Haiti, Ivory Coast, Tanzania and Zambia.Biafra was also "de facto" recognised by France, Spain, Portugal, Norway, Israel, Rhodesia, South Africa and the Vatican City.

Biafra also had aid from non-state actors, including Joint Church Aid, foreign mercenaries and the Holy Ghost Fathers of Ireland.

The United States government under president Lyndon B. Johnson was officially neutral during the war. There was strong public support for Biafra in the US. American activists founded the American Committee to Keep Biafra Alive to spread propaganda. United States president Richard Nixon was supportive of the Biafran cause. Before he won the 1968 presidential election he accused Nigeria of committing genocide against the Biafrans. He also called for the United States to intervene in the war on the side of Biafra. His efforts failed because of the demands of the ongoing Vietnam War. After two-and-a-half years of war with Nigeria, during which almost two million Biafran civilians (three-quarters of them being smaller children) died from starvation caused by the Nigerian blockade of the region.
An early body created by the Biafran government was the Bank of Biafra, made under "Decree No. 3 of 1967". The bank carried out all central banking functions including the management of foreign exchange and the management of Biafra's public debt. The bank was managed by a governor and four directors. The first governor was Sylvester Ugoh. A second degree, "Decree No. 4 of 1967", changed the Banking Act of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the Republic of Biafra.

The bank was originally in Enugu but because of the Nigerian Civil War it had to be moved multiple times. Biafra tried to finance the war through foreign exchange. This effort increased when Nigeria said that its currency wouldn't be legal tender (to make way for a new currency).

Matías González

Matías González (6 August 1925 – 12 May 1984) was a Uruguayan footballer, who played for C.A. Cerro. He was known as a complete defender who stood out for his leadership, man-marking, toughness tackling and pace. Commonly considered as one of the finest Uruguayan defenders of all time. He won the 1950 FIFA World Cup with Uruguay, he was in the starting lineup for the Uruguayan national team at Maracanaço, where he had a defensive performance described as "impeccable", sticking to top scorer Ademir and also annulling Friaça in the first half.

González only defended Cerro, a small club from Montevideo that never won the Uruguayan championship. The team rose in 1946 back to the tournament's first division, from which it had been absent since relegation in 1929. From there until González officially stopped playing for the club, aged 35, the most common placement was fifth place, as in 1949, 1950 and 1951, achieving third place as the best position precisely in 1955 and 1956. He won the Torneo Cuadrangular in 1953 and 1956. He was known as a fan favourite of the club and is recognized one of the most successful players.

Because of good performances at Cerro, González debuted for the Uruguayan national team on April 13, 1949. The date corresponded to Celeste's debut in the 1949 Copa América. He was the only Cerro player called up to the competition; the club was last in the Uruguayan league the previous year when it ended, after the first round of the second round.

The Uruguayan championship of 1948 was interrupted by a strike that would only end in April 1949, when Copa America took place. Thus, it was decided that the home title would go to the then leader Nacional, and that there would be no relegation. 

The strike meant that secondary players were called to the Copa América, with youth, athletes from the interior or anyone who had not joined the protest - this was the case of González. In the campaign that yielded only a sixth place out of eight participants, González was in the starting line-up, as well as the only man called up for the 1950 FIFA World Cup.

He, Rubén Morán and Héctor Vilches became Cerro's first players called up to a FIFA World Cup. Of them, González was the first to debut, participating in all of the team's games in the tournament. Morán was only in the Maracanaço, enough to make Cerro the third most represented team in the decision against Brazil, behind only Nacional (with three) and Peñarol (six).

Uruguay came into the World Cup in a turbulent environment; Obdulio Varela even reported that the players were close to not going to Brazil, in protest against reprisals by leaders against the recent strike. In addition, coach Juan López had been chosen just a month before the tournament, after Celeste Olímpica got bad results against the Brazilians themselves, which, in addition to the defeats for the Copa Rio Branco, also included a defeat for Brazil in Pelotas and, in Montevideo, two draws against Fluminense; Uruguayan players found themselves out of shape after two months of inactivity. Before López chose the Uruguayan Football Association, Peñarol even vetoed the call up of its players: the AUF despised the coach of the aurinegra team, the Hungarian Emérico Hirschl, desired by the fans and the media. With little time to put the team together, López called exactly the players who played in the Copa Rio Branco weeks before the world cup.

The Río Branco Cup unfolded in three matches, with Matías González playing all of them, repeating in the first two the defense duo with Vilches, later replaced by Eusebio Tejera, who would be González 's partner in the world cup. González's presence in the team was favored by the intervention of Obdulio Varela, as González had been boycotted by colleagues for not having joined the 1948 strike. González was a hero in a complicated game against Spain, already in the final quadrangular. The South Americans started winning, but suffered the comeback and needed a risky long-distance shot by Obdulio Varela to equalize in the last twenty minutes. The defender saved at the top of the line what could have been the Spanish victory in the last bid and he was named hero of the match. At Maracanazo, González was the most defensive Uruguayan player, not coming out much beyond the half moon. He was in charge of personally marking top scorer Ademir, sticking to him with support from Rodríguez Andrade on the left, Gambetta on the right and Tejera in the center.

The Woman in the Dunes

It is August 1955. A school teacher from Tokyo called Jumpei Niki goes to a fishing village. He is there to collect insects. Jumpei misses the last bus back to Tokyo. Villagers lead him to a house in some dunes. In the house lives a widow. The house also keeps filling up with sand which the woman clears away.

The next day, Jumpei wakes up to find the ladder out of the house gone. To receive water from the villagers, he must live with the widow and dig away the sand. At one point, Jumpei escapes, but is chased down by the villagers.

The pair in the house discover a water reservoir while digging in the sand. Jumpei now has no reason to help dig away the sand, yet at this point, he continues his duty. Jumpei and the widow later become a couple, and the widow gets pregnant and delivers a baby. The ladder is left in the house, but Jumpei does not escape. Jumpei instead thinks about telling the villagers about the reservoir.

Seven years after Jumpei went missing, Jumpei's wife has her husband declared deceased.

"The Woman in the Dunes" has been interpreted in many ways. George Mullins sees the lack of named characters as a way for the story to take a universal quality. He also says that the story is a metaphor for modern Japanese employment.

In his introduction of the novel, writer David Mitchell interprets the villagers as being "burakumin." He sees the villager's actions as a logical reaction to the government abandoning them. They punish Jumpei with hard labor as the villagers believe he is part of the system that abandoned them.

The novel was well-received in Japan and abroad. Yukio Mishima and Jirō Osaragi have both praised the novel. In his review, Mullins describes the novel as thought-provoking. It won the Yomiuri Prize in 1962.

Disappearance of Cecilia Strzyzowski

Cecilia Marlene Strzyzowski is a 28-year-old woman from Resistencia, Argentina who was last seen on June 1, 2023 leaving her aunt's house. She was with her partner, César Sena, who is defendant in the case of her disappearance. Also involved are César's parents, Emerenciano Sena and Marcela Acuña. They are social leaders who have strong political ties to Chaco Province Governor Jorge Capitanich. The prosecutor in charge of the case has said that the act is an alleged homicide. The case has generated attention and outrage at the local and national level.

The disappearance report was filed on June 5 by Gloria Romero, Cecilia's mother. According to security cameras, Cecilia was seen entering Sena's house on June 2, but there is no record of his departure. In addition, the videos show Obregón leaving the home with black bags, which are presumed to be the body of the young woman. Later, Emerenciano and Acuña get into the vehicle and leave the house.

On June 18, the primary elections of the 2023 Chaco Provincial Elections were held, and the media agreed that the case had an influence on the results, which resulted in a victory for the opposition to the government.

Cecilia Strzyzowski worked as an administrative employee at the Emerenciano Sena health center and lived with her partner, César Sena, 19, at the house of Cecilia's aunt, Mercedes. According to the testimony of Gloria Romero, Cecilia's mother and complainant in the case of her disappearance, the relationship between Cecilia and César began in December 2021 through Tinder. However, problems arose in the relationship, especially due to the resistance of César's mother towards their union. In addition, possible control by César over Cecilia's movements through WhatsApp and the possession of weapons by César, who claims to be politically persecuted, has been mentioned.

On September 16, 2022, Cecilia and César were married, but four days later they began divorce proceedings, allegedly influenced by César's mother who did not support the relationship. The young couple handed out invitation cards for a wedding party to be held on December 23, however the divorce decree came out two days before and the celebration was postponed indefinitely.

Cecilia's mother was unaware of this divorce at the time of her disappearance. The affective relationship between Cecilia and César continued and they were seen together regularly. Cecilia's mother stated that for her, César was an excellent partner and expressed surprise at the version of a friend of Cecilia's, who alleged that on May 3, César would have physically assaulted Cecilia. According to this same statement, Sena was medicated, he would have hit his own mother at one point, and he was manipulating Cecilia.

On June 1, 2023, Cecilia had a video call with her mother Gloria Romero and told her that she would have a trip to Ushuaia with her partner, César Sena; the reason was a job opportunity. That same afternoon Cecilia Strzyzowski was seen leaving her aunt's house in Resistencia with César Sena. 

At that time, he was wearing light gray sweatpants, a dark gray jacket, and gray sneakers with pink details in turn, Sena carried a partially empty red backpack. According to a family member of Cecilia's, her partner was nervous at that moment and when questioned about the scant luggage, he replied that he would "buy the clothes in Buenos Aires" It should be noted that in Resistencia the average temperature in June is 15 °C and in Ushuaia 2 °C. According to the mother, on Friday the 2nd they should take a flight to Buenos Aires from Corrientes.

Écréhous

The Écréhous (or in Jèrriais: "Êcrého") are a group of islands and rocks that are six miles (9.6 km) northeast of Jersey. They are eight miles (12.8 km) away from France. They are part of the Parish of St. Martin in the Bailiwick of Jersey.

In 1203, John, Duke of Normandy gave the Ecrehos to the Abbey of Val-Richer so that they could build a church there.

The monks went back to Val-Richer in 1413. Their church on La Maîtr'Île slowly became ruins.

In the 17th century, the Ecrehos were used by smugglers. The main items smuggled through the Ecrehos in the 1690s were lead and gunpowder. Those items were being sent to St Malô.

To control voting in Jersey, citizens were often kidnapped and left on the islands until after the voting was finished.

In 1950, France started a case against the United Kingdom in the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The case was to decide which country owned the Minquiers and Ecrehos. The French fished there, but Jersey made the laws. In the "Minquiers and Ecrehos case", the ICJ considered the history of the area. It gave the islands to Jersey on November 17, 1953.

The biggest islets in the group are:
Some of the others are:

All of them but the biggest three go underwater at high tide. There is no fresh water on the islands. Nobody lives on any of them. Due to erosion, they are now much smaller than they may have been in the past. Maîtr'Île, the biggest islet, is about 300 metres (0.19 mi) long.

The diary was found by a woman in the Auschwitz concentration camp in June 1945, where she was with the Red Army serving as a physician. The woman was unsuccessful in her attempts to find someone who would translate the diary. 

Decades later, the woman's granddaughter who lived in San Francisco in the U.S., who had the diary with her, contacted several Holocaust museums to try to translate the diary (she brought the diary with her from Russia in the 1990's), but to no avail, until Judy Janec, a archivist in the Holocaust Center of North California, accepted her request to translate the diary.

The diary was eventually published as a book titled ""The Diary of Rywka Lipszyc"" in 2014, six years after Judy Janec translated it, in 2008.

2023 Pacific hurricane season

The 2023 Pacific hurricane season is the current hurricane season in the Pacific Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere. The season began on May 15 in the eastern Pacific (east of 140°W) and on June 1 in the central Pacific (from 140°W to the International Date Line). The season will end for both on November 30.
The beginning of the season had little activity. The first storm, Hurricane Adrian, did not develop until June 27. Hurricane Beatriz formed two days later along the coast of Mexico.

On June 23, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring an area of low pressure which formed off the coast of southern Mexico. On June 27 the storm became organized and the NHC began posting advisories for Tropical Storm Adrian. Adrian strengthened and became the first hurricane of the season on June 28 while southwest of Manzanillo, Cloima. On June 30, Adrian reached Category 2 status, with sustained winds of up to . Adrian began weakening and degenerated into a remnant low on July 2.

On June 25 an area of low pressure formed off the cost of Costa Rica. The NHC began posting advisories for the system, named Potential Tropical Cyclone Two-E on June 28. The next day, the system became organized and was named Tropical Storm Beatriz that evening. Beatriz traveled along the coast of Mexico and was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane on June 30, with sustained winds of up to . Beatriz weakened to a tropical storm early on July 1, and dissipated later that day.

One person drowned in Mazatlán, Sinaloa, on July 1, while surfing high waves created by the remains of Beatriz.

As of 4:00 p.m. AST (21:00 UTC) October 28, Tropical Depression Nineteen-E is located about southwest of San Salvador, El Salvador. Maximum sustained winds are , with gusts up to . The minimum barometric pressure is , and the system is stationary.

Oleg

Oleg known as Oleg the Wise, Oleg of Novgorod, or Oleg of Kiev, was a Varangian prince of the Rus' who became the first prince of Kiev, thereby laying the foundations of the Kievan Rus' state.

Grivna

The grivna was a currency as well as a measure of weight used in Kievan Rus' and other states in Eastern Europe from the 11th century.

As its etymology implies the word originally meant a necklace or a torque. The reason why it has taken the meaning of a unit of weight is unclear. The grivnas that have been found at various archaeological sites are not necklaces but bullions of precious metals, usually silver. The weight and the shape of grivnas were not uniform, but varied by region. The grivnas of Novgorod and Pskov were thin long round-edged or three-edged ingots, while Kievan grivnas have rather the shape of a prolonged rhombus. The material was either gold or silver, but silver was predominant. Originally the weight of a grivna was close to the Roman or Byzantine pound. The weight of the Kievan grivna was around 140–165 g (0.309–0.364 lb). The Novgorod grivna had the weight 204 grams (0.450 lb) and became the basis for monetary systems in northeastern Rus', including the emerging Grand Duchy of Moscow.

Carlsbad Caverns National Park

Carlsbad Caverns National Park is an American national park in the Guadalupe Mountains of southeastern New Mexico. It is in the Delaware Basin. Most people come here to see the show cave Carlsbad Cavern. Visitors to the cave can hike down the natural entrance. They could also take an elevator from the visitor center.

The park entrance is by US Highway 62/180, roughly southwest of Carlsbad, New Mexico. The park has two entries on the National Register of Historic Places: The Caverns Historic District and the Rattlesnake Springs Historic District. Roughly two-thirds of the park has been set aside as a wilderness area. This means that there will be no future changes to the habitat.

Carlsbad Cavern has a large limestone chamber, named the Big Room, which is almost long, wide, and high at its highest point.

In 1898, a teenager named Jim White went into the cavern with a homemade wire ladder. He named many of the rooms.

Until 1932, visitors had to walk down a ramp that took them below the surface. The walk back up made some of them tired. In 1932, the national park opened a large visitor center building. It had two elevators that would take visitors in and out of the caverns below.

According to the Köppen climate classification system, the Carlsbad Caverns Visitor Center has a cool semi-arid climate ("BS"). 

Seventeen species of bats live in the park. Many of the bats in the cave are Mexican free-tailed bats. People say that the number of Mexican free-tailed bats used to be several million, but has gone down a lot in modern times. The cause is unknown, but organochlorine pesticides (specifically DDT and dieldrin) are likely part of the reason. A 2009 study by a team from Boston University says that there may have never been millions of bats in the caves.

Scientists have tried to count the bats in many different ways. Using thermal imaging cameras to track the bats worked the best.

The Mexican free-tailed bats are there from April or May to late October or early November. They fly out of the cave in a dense group, corkscrewing upwards. They usually start flying out around sunset. The event usually lasts about three hours. Every evening from Memorial Day weekend to mid October, a ranger talks about the bats while visitors sitting in the amphitheater wait to watch them fly out.

Elza, Tennessee

Elza was a community in Anderson County, Tennessee, that existed before 1942. The area was taken over for the Manhattan Project. It is now part of the city of Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

When the federal government looked at sites for the Manhattan Project buildings that ultimately were sited at Oak Ridge, the Oak Ridge site was described in internal memos as "near Elza." During World War II, Elza was the site of one of the security gates on the borders of the then-closed city of Oak Ridge. It was on the road from Clinton to Oak Ridge.

The Luther Brannon House, built in 1941, was a surviving structure associated with the Elza community. 

During World War II and for some time after, the Manhattan Engineer District and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission used several warehouses in the Elza area for storage of uranium ore and other materials. In the early 1990s, the U.S. Department of Energy cleaned up the site, where soil had been found to be contaminated by PCBs and uranium.

Luther Brannon House

The Luther Brannon House was a stone bungalow building in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. It was one of the few buildings from before World War II that were still in the area.

The house was built in 1941. It was taken by the U.S. Army for the Manhattan Project a few months later. It was one of about 180 buildings that were not destroyed after the area was taken for the Manhattan Project. The house is believed to have been used as headquarters for local project operations and a house for General Leslie Groves until the Army finished building new administration buildings.

After the war, when most other pre-war buildings in Oak Ridge were torn down, the house was not torn down. As of 1991, it was one of only three pre-World War II houses left in Oak Ridge. The others were Freels Cabin and the J. B. Jones House. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because it was related to the early development of Oak Ridge.

The house was badly damaged by a fire in July 2014. As of April 2020, the fire damage still had not been repaired, and the property was listed for sale. As of February 2021, the house had been demolished. It was removed from the National Register of Historic Places in October 2021.

Bellwether

A bellwether is something that is an indicator of trends. The term is used in economics, law and politics.

In politics, a bellwether seat is a seat that is generally won by the party that forms government.

Australian psephologist Antony Green, who reports live election results for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), classified 11 federal seats as bellwether seats for the 2016 federal election: Dobell, Eden-Monaro, Lindsay, Macarthur, Page and Robertson in New South Wales; Forde, Herbert, Leichhardt and Petrie in Queensland; and Makin in South Australia. Other seats sometimes considered bellwether seats include Corangamite in Victoria; Longman in Queensland; Hasluck in Western Australia; Hindmarsh in South Australia; Bass and Braddon in Tasmania; and Solomon in the Northern Territory. However, many of these seats would no longer be considered bellwether seats; in 2022, when the Coalition lost power to the Labor Party, the Coalition retained the seats of Bass, Braddon, Forde, Herbert, Leichhardt, Lindsay, Longman, Page and Petrie, while Labor already held the seats of Corangamite, Dobell, Eden-Monaro, Hindmarsh, Macarthur, Makin and Solomon, with Labor only gaining two of the mentioned seats from the Coalition (i.e Hasluck and Robertson).

The state seats of Camden, Monaro and Penrith in New South Wales; and Bentleigh, Carrum, Frankston and Mordialloc in Victoria (often called the four "sandbelt" seats); Barron River and Mundingburra in Queensland; and Albany, Geraldton, Joondalup, Southern River and Swan Hills in Western Australia; are often considered bellwether seats.
