Curlew

The curlew is Numenius, a bird with a long downcurved bill (beak). With its beak the bird probes mudflats for food. 

In pre-modern times the world had many more mudflats than it does today. Many have been eliminated by draining so as to give more land for farming. So, in England, the places suitable for the bird were in river estuaries and low-lying land. Originally, southern England had wide areas of mudflats suitable for the bird.

What changed was the draining of the "levels" to make for better farming. In England areas in East Anglia, Kent and Somerset were all drained and made productive farmland. A similar process happened in many countries. The consequence is that the curlews' numbers have dropped and the bird has become rare in places where it was once common.

Broadly speaking, curlews are waders, as are the godwits which look similar but have straight bills.

Most curlews migrate and so one or more species occur at different times of the year in Europe, Ireland, Britain, Iberia, Iceland, Africa, Southeast Asia, Siberia, North America, South America and Australasia. There are nine species of curlew.

UNICEF made a study: According to this study, child poverty increased in 17 of the 24 OECD countries, between 1995 and 2005. In the other seven countries it decreased. Six of the seven countries where it decreased had a high level of child poverty. The only exception to this is Norway, where child poverty has been decresing for a long time. 

The biggest increase was in Poland (+4.3%), Luxembourg (+4.1%) and the Czech Republic (also +4.1%). The biggest decrease was in England (-3.1%), the United States (-2.8%) and Norway (-1.8%).

In these states, a child is defined as "poor" if the family income is less than a cetain percentage of the median income of a family for that county. 

Absolute poverty is the most severe form of povery. People in that category don't have enough money to conver the basic human needs, such as safe drinking water, sanitation, health, and shelter. 

Children affected by poverty face a number of problems:


An estimated 385 million children live in extreme poverty. According to the UNICEF:

Social inequality

Thomas Callan Hodson, the then British Political Agent of 1908 Manipur, quoted in his monograph, The Meitheis, as follows:
<poem>
"The women hold a high and free position in Manipur, all the integral trade and exchange of the produce of the country being managed by them. The habit of the country is to have bazars (markets) at convenient spots by the road side, where a handful of women congregate at the early hour...!"
</poem>

She was offered hand in marriage to the Ahom king to strengthen the relationship between the two kingdoms as well as to get military aid from the Ahoms for the Meiteis to resist the Burmese conquest of Manipur.

Thambalnu was a lady (Meitei Nupi) from a poor family in Yairipok town of Manipur. But her beauty and charm causes conflicts among many able men in the kingdom in her times. During flood times from the Imphal river in the kingdom, the Royal Oracle proclaimed that the water god Wangbren will be pleased if a young girl is offered to Him. Since Thambalnu became a problem for numerous men, she was chosen to be offered to the deity. So, she was forcibly (or voluntarily) put in sacrifice to the strong river flow. After her death, the flood was also gone.

Queen Kumudini was widowed when her son was at a ripe age. She devised many diplomatic relations and plots to protect the throne from the other family members of the royalty. When her son, Chandrakirti became the king, she was known as a popular feminine icon in the kingdom.

Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS

HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), the virus caused by AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) and is one of the most serious public health challenges in the world. However, the world is committed to preventing new HIV infections and ensuring that everyone living with HIV has access to HIV treatment. In 2019, an estimated 170 million people worldwide are infected with HIV, since 2010, the number of new HIV infections fell by 23%. For example, in one year, this is different from the number of people diagnosed with HIV in one year. Worldwide, about 81 percent of people living with HIV know their HIV status in 2019. The remaining 19% (about 710 million people) still need access to HIV testing services. Important way HIV testing is the gateway to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services.

HIV/AIDS is a major concern epidemic in Africa and cause of death in many parts of Africa. Although the continent contains about 15.2% of the world's population, Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for about 69% of HIV patients, and 70% of all AIDS deaths in 2011. In the North African countries have the lowest prevalence rates, as their populations usually share cultural patterns that reduce the spread of the disease, in contrast to what the desert countries did in Africa. Southern Africa is the most affected region on the continent. As of 2011, HIV has infected at least 10% of the population in Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

AIDS cases in most countries in Western Europe have fallen to levels not seen since the initial outbreak; many people attribute this trend to active education campaigns, blood transfusion screening and increased condom use. In addition, since new AIDS treatments have proven to be effective (even if expensive) methods to suppress HIV, Western Europe’s AIDS mortality rate has also fallen very much in the past few years. There are many ways to transmit HIV, including paid sex, sex between men, injecting drugs, mother-to-child behavior, and heterosexual behavior. However, many new infections in this area have occurred through contact with HIV-infected people in other areas. The prevalence of adults (15-49 years old) in the region is 0.3%, and there are currently 570,000 to 890,000 HIV-infected persons. Due to the availability of antiretroviral therapy, the number of deaths from AIDS has remained low since the trough in the late 1990s. However, in some countries, there is still a large number of undiagnosed HIV, and the evidence of resistance to antiretroviral drugs in some newly infected people in the region is worrying. In addition, the risky behaviors of men who come into contact with men have recently increased.

As of 2008, 4.7 million people in Asia were infected with HIV. The United Nations believes that the epidemic in Asia peaked in the mid-1990s, and that the annual rate of HIV infection subsequently decreased by more than half. Regionally, the epidemic has remained fairly stable since the 2000s.

In 2016, it was estimated that 1.5 million adults and children were infected with HIV / AIDS in North America, excluding Central America and the Caribbean. 70,000 adults and children are newly infected each year, with an adult prevalence rate of 0.5%. 26,000 people die of AIDS in North America each year.

At the beginning of 2018, there are almost about 1 million people living with HI /AIDS in South America. By the number of its population, Brazil is the country with the most HIV-positive people with 830,000 people. As of April 2018, Chile is the country with the most infections. While the Falkland Islands are the only territory where no cases were detected. The biggest problem that exists is discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS in less developed countries. This is due to ignorance of the disease, with outdated premises and the high religious population by influenced to other people.

In this region, the national conditions regarding HIV and AIDS vary greatly. Part of the reason is the distance between the major islands in Oceania. The extensive development of the region also plays an important role. It is estimated that the prevalence of between 0.2 to 0.7 percent, there are currently 45,000 to 120,000 adults and children living with HIV. Papua New Guinea is one of the worst AIDS epidemic in the region. According to UNAIDS, since 1997, HIV cases in the country at a rate of 30% per year, by the end of 2006, HIV prevalence in the country is about 1.3% from the population.

Pollinator

A pollinator is an animal that does pollination. Pollination is almost entirely done by insects, though there are some exceptions. Some birds (such as hummingbirds) pollinate flowers as they take nectar. Overall, however, it is insects that pollinate. Bees, of course, pollinate flowers as they take nectar. But wasps, ants, flies, beetles, butterflies and moths all have many species which are pollinators. The plant which offers the pollen is called the "pollenizer".

To be a pollinator, an insect has to move pollen from the male anther to the female stigma of a flower. The pollinator gets away with much of the pollen for its own use.

Although it is obvious that flowering plants are the plants which usually offer pollen, there is a pre-history of pollination in cycads.

Bees may not be the most numerous insects which take up the pollen. Hoverflies (Syrphidae) are very numerous visitors to flowers, and they may be more numerous than bees in many environments.

The list of pollinators is long. Bees, wasps, ants, flies, mosquitoes, lepidoptera and beetles all have some pollinators who take nectar, and also some vertebrates: bats, birds, monkeys, lemurs, possums, rodents.

Wild pollinators often visit many plant species, and plants are visited by many pollinator species. All these relations together form a network of interactions between plants and pollinators. Surprising similarities exist in the networks of interactions between plants and pollinators. This structure is similar in very different ecosystems on different continents, consisting of entirely different species.

Gengan Tonaki

Gengan Tonaki (渡名喜元完; "Tonaki Gengan", 30 October 1884 – 24 January 1997) was a Japanese (Okinawan) farmer and supercentenarian, and at the time of his death at age 112 years, 86 days the oldest Japanese man ever (although the claimed 120-year-old Shigechiyo Izumi was believed to have been older) before being beaten by Denzo Ishizaki.

Tonaki was born in late October 1884 in Sashiki (today Nanjō), Okinawa, as the second child and only boy of seven siblings, of whom one sister, who was eight years younger, was still living at the time of his death. In mid-1st decade of the 20th century, Tonaki fled to Hawaii to avoid the Russo-Japanese War and worked at a sugar refinery for about ten years before returning to Okinawa, working as a farmer until age 89. He married a woman named Kame (who was eight years younger and died at age 61 during the Battle of Okinawa) and had six children (of whom one died young of liver disease and four, all except his second son, died during the Battle of Okinawa).

Tonaki became the oldest living man in Japan on 20 September 1991, after 108-year-old Gihei Oka's death and also the oldest living Japanese man overall, later on 16 February 1992 after the 109 years, 13 days old Russo-Japanese War veteran Mamoru Eto's death, as Eto who was just 4 days younger than Oka emigrated to the United States, and later on 30 October 1994 only the second Japanese man who became a supercentenarian, after Eiju Tsuru who died on 11 January 1990, just 24 days before his 111th birthday, although Shigechiyo Izumi who died on 21 February 1986 was still believed to have been aged 120 years, 237 days and Denzo Ishizaki claimed to have been ten days older than Tonaki, as his birth register which showed a birth year of 1886 rather than 1884 was claimed to have been delayed by two years.

After 111-year-old Frenchman Émile Fourcade's death on 29 December 1995, Tonaki became the last living man born in 1884 as well as the second-oldest living man behind Danish-born Americanman Christian Mortensen, although Americanman Johnson Parks has been verified to have been 15 days older than Tonaki but recently become disputed after a study proving that he may have been born around ten years later than he claimed.

The then current US president Barack Obama won the primary against Tennessee attorney and candidate who had a record of losing John Wolfe Jr, who got nearly 42% of the vote, which many people didn't think would happen. All 47 voters to decide the winner of the primary were given to, and said they would vote for Barack Obama at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. While John Wolfe Jr. was allowed 19 delegates to the convention because of how he had done in Arkansas, state party officials said Wolfe missed two paperwork filing deadlines related to the voters for the convention process, therefore he was not allowed to be given them. Wolfe started legal proceedings to have voters in the primary in his name allowed. Eight other delegates who didn't announce who they'd vote for, known as superdelegates, also attended the convention and cast their votes as well.

Match fixing

Match fixing, in organized sports, occurs as a match is played to an entirely or partly pre-determined result. This violates the rules of the game and often the law. The most common reason is to get a payoff from gamblers.

The major motivations behind match fixing are gambling and the future team advantage. In Eastern Europe, mafia gangsters are linked to illegal gambling and match fixing. In Russia, people have disappeared or died after acting against bribes in sports.

Many sports have tournaments where the result of one round determines their opponent in the next. By losing a match, a particular team can face an easier opponent in the next round. This makes them much more likely to win.


Sports betting

Sports betting is the activity of predicting sports and placing wagers on the outcome. Some suggest bets were placed for the first time in Ancient Greece, while others insist there is evidence of similar betting activities even before that.

In many parts of the United States, sports betting is illegal. It is legal in several other states. They include Iowa, New York, Rhode Island, Colorado and Nevada. In countries like Australia, New Zealand, and Sweden sports betting winnings are not taxed. Other jurisdictions, like Germany, impose taxes on wagering profits, but naturally the percentage varies from one country to another.

Sports betting can be done on several Internet websites or in public.

The bookmaker, also known as “a betting agency” or “sportsbook” is a company or a person that provides the sports betting services at odds, agreed upon in advance.

Its high flash point makes it a hard to light fuel, so it is not much use in the petrochemical industry. However, an isomer of icosane, "n"-Icosane (the straight-chain structural isomer of icosane) is the shortest compound found in paraffin waxes (CH, where formula_1) used to form candles. Icosane's phase transition at a moderate temperature makes it a candidate for PCM, which is used to store thermal energy and control temperature.

Icosane is a non-polar molecule: quite unreactive except when it burns (see the NFPA Diamond in the infobox). It is also way less dense than insoluble in water. This also means it shares properties with its smaller alkaline counterparts.

Icosane can also be detected in the body odor of people diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease.

Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I

Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I, The Woman in Gold, or The Lady in Gold is a painting by Gustav Klimt of Adele Bloch-Bauer, a woman who lived in Vienna. He painted the painting in 1907.

Klimt was a Symbolist artist and this painting was part of his Golden Phase. The painting is covered in gilt and other shining decoration. Art Nouveau, the Arts and Crafts movement, Byzantine art and Egyptian art influenced Klimt at this time.

Klimt prepared carefully before painting the painting. He started in 1902. He drew over 100 sketches to practice. Klimt went to the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna and looked at Byzantine mosaics.

Klimt started with gold leaf and silver leaf and then put gesso on top to make patterns.

According to Klimt's website, Bloch-Bauer was his mistress. She is also the only woman he ever painted twice. Adele's husband, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, hired Klimt to paint both paintings. Klimt painted "Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II" in 1912. Some artists also think Adele Bloch-Bauer might be the woman in "The Kiss" and "Judith and the Head of Holofernes".

Before Adele Bloch-Bauer died, she said she wanted the painting to go to the Belvedere Gallery. But, at the time, the painting belonged to her husband and not to her.

During World War II, the Nazis stole the painting from Bloch-Bauer's family. It did end up in the Belvedere Gallery.

One of the reasons this painting is famous is that it was in a United States Supreme Court case, "Republic of Austria v. Altmann", in 2004. Adele Bloch-Bauer's niece, Maria Altmann, tried to get the painting back from the Belvedere Gallery. The Supreme Court said the painting was Altmann's. Because Aultmann could not pay for insurance and storage, she sold the painting to Ronald Lauder to put in the Neue Gallery in New York City.

The 2015 movie "Woman in Gold" is about Maria Altmann trying to get the painting back from the Belvedere Gallery.

His real name is Masayuki Nouchi (野内 正行, "Nouchi Masayuki") and his nickname was Hideto (ヒデト). After performing as the lead singer for GS's band Ox, he has been active as a singer with a focus on enka (a traditional style of Japanese music). Hideto grew up in Tagawa City, Fukuoka Prefecture.

In 1967, Hideto joined the manga and backbone trio (with Yukihiro Kimura And The Backbones) and began his professional career as a singer. Also, with Kimura's instruction to "sing rock", sing "Long Tall Sally" by The Beatles from June of that year and then sing "Out of Time" and "Tell Me" by The Rolling Stones. (The fact that the manager of Penguin-do recommended that the LP of the live version of the Stones had a great influence on Hideto Noguchi's theatrical performance later), and the name of Hideto Noguchi in Kansai was given to know gradually.

The intense staging became popular and the mobilization power increased when the spine appeared. Toshio Fukui, the leader of the GS Ox band, who saw the performance of "Tel Me" at the Jazz Cafe "Number Ichiban", said: "Only our band and The Spiders have the Binson resonance chamber in Japan! " Noguchi joined the band in December 1967, but at the time he didn't know what Binson was. He made his debut as the vocalist of "Ox" in May 1968. His stage name is Hideto Noguchi, in honor of Meiji era bacteriologist Hideyo Noguchi. He made Top 10 and Top 20 hits like "Girl Friend", "Dancing Seventeen", "Swan no Nami" and "I'm Burning". The "Girl Friend", "Swan no Nami" and other two songs were composed by Kyōhei Tsutsumi. At the beginning of her debut, Ai Akamatsu's popularity preceded him, but when he released his second single, "Dancing Seventeen," it overwhelmingly separated him from the popularity poll, and the center of popularity shifted to Hideto Noguchi. In the mid to late GS boom, many dialogues between Kenji Sawada, Kenichi Hagiwara and Hideto Noguchi were seen in magazines.

Performances began at six venues across the country in September, causing a swoon on the stage at every venue, including the Tokyo Metropolitan Hibiya Public Hall on the first day, which the media hyped them as "bands passing out." Ox was called the "GS Gosanke" along with The Tigers and The Tempters. On May 23, 1970, the Ox held the "Subtitle" Second Anniversary Concert and "Blow Off Elvis Presley". It was a concert that also served as a new song announcement for me, but Ox at the time was still quite popular along side with the Tigers. The group was disbanded on May 31, 1971. In that same year, Hideto made his first solo debut with "Masked". After that, he released singles such as "What Else Is There" and "Yozora no Fuseki", and released the album "Hidetokara You ni" which contains his own "Clown Who Forgot To Laugh" line.

In 1975, he prepared to leave from the Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation "All Japan Kayo Championship" and won 10 awards every weeks. Renamed to "Hideto Maki" after his teacher Yoko Yamaguchi, he made his debut as an enka singer again with "Yumeyo Mouichido". This debut song became the first big hit as a solo singer and it broke again to rank 9th on the Oricon national chart and won several excellent newcomer awards. Also, despite being released in September, it is in the Oricon Annual Best 100, and was selected as a candidate song for the 17th Japan Record Awards nomination at the end of the year. Many of the fans were middle and high school students who couldn't see the GS era in real time, and Maki himself was concerned that it would end with a transitory boom.

As an aside, the kanji for "ki" with Hideto Maki was separated by Hiroshi Itsuki from the same office at the request of Yoko Yamaguchi.

Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi

Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi (国際秘密警察 鍵の鍵, "International Secret Police: Key of Keys"), also known as Key of Keys, is a 1965 Japanese comedy-spy movie directed by Senkichi Taniguchi. It is the fourth installment of five movies in the Kokusai himitsu keisatsu series, a parody of James Bond-style spy movies.

Woody Allen used this movie, combined with footage from the third installment "" (国際秘密警察:火薬の樽, "International Secret Police: Keg of Gunpowder"), to make his directorial debut, in which the original dialogue is redubbed in English to make the plot about a secret egg salad recipe.

As part of Toho's "International Secret Police Series" 3rd part "Keg of Gunpowder" and 4th part "Key of Keys" were replaced by American movie director and actor Woody Allen, and a scene was added to take a picture of the bone. It was re-edited into one comedy gag movie.

The Japanese actors have also appeared in the movie but with different names such as Tatsuya Mihashi ("Phil Moscowitz"), Akiko Wakabayashi ("Suki Yaki"), Mie Hama ("Teri Yaki"), Tadao Nakamaru ("Shepherd Wong"), and Susumu Kurobe ("Wing Fat"). With stereotyped Asian customs as a comic point, it is a careful parody of spy movies represented by the "007 series" at that time.

The content is also a mess that an international spy played by Phil regains the "world's best egg salad recipe" stolen in a certain country, but although it is a parody, it is also Woody Allen's first movie as director. It is a work and is still highly evaluated by American movie critics.

However, Woody himself is said to be extremely avoiding touching this movie. He would appear in "Casino Royale" in 1967 back in England as Jimmy Bond. DVDs are also on sale overseas, but in Japan, they haven't seen the movie due to issues such as copyrights with Toho, Japan's major movie studio company.

Mie Hama and Akiko Wakabayashi would later be chosen by Eon Productions for the sixth James Bond movie, "You Only Live Twice" a year later as Bond girls.

Secret agent Jiro Kitami, who had infiltrated Tonwan, was requested by the director of intelligence Sritai to steal a large amount of money that was hidden by Gegen, leader of the rebel guerrillas associated with "Darkness". He was teamed up with two beautiful female agents, Miichin and Bai-Lan.

However, there was no cash in the safe inside the ship, only a piece of paper with a text that looked like a code.

Biscotti

Biscotti is an Italian type of almond biscuit. It originated from the Tuscan city of Prato. They are twice-baked, oblong-shaped, dry, crunchy, and may be dipped in a drink, traditionally Vin Santo.

Biscotti is also known as cantucci.

Although commonly used to indicate the biscuits of Prato, "biscotti di Prato", in modern Italy and Argentina they are also known widely by the name "cantuccini". These names sound similar to other regional products of Italy. The term cantuccini is most commonly used today in Tuscany, but originally refers to variations or imitations which deviate from the traditional recipe in a few key points such as the use of yeasts, acids (to make them less dry) and flavourings. Rusks are larger, longer biscuits, rustic bread dough enriched with olive oil and anise seeds.

The confusion on the name may have been born from the fact that on the old sign (still present) of "Biscottificio Antonio Mattei," the leading manufacturer of biscuits of Prato, is written just below the name of the shop: "Manufacturers of cantuccini," which at the time were one of the major products of the biscuits. The sign has remained unchanged, and after such a long time people are accustomed to associate the name "cantuccini" with the biscuits typical of Sardinia and Sicily.

Biscotti is made with flour, sugar, eggs and almonds or pine nuts. Sometimes they have a layer of glaze, usually chocolate.

In 1965, they began to appear regularly on electric programs such as the TV programs "Beat No. 1" and "Young Pops Excite", and the band's name recognition gradually increased. In May of the following year, Shin Okamoto, who was a 16 year old vocalist from Kanagawa at that time, reluctantly joined the group and they became popular in the magazines and songs. The Play Five was renamed to The Jaguars in June 1967 and made their record debut with "Kimi Niaitai" (Want To See You Again).

This debut songs was a big hit, and popular songs such as "Dancing Lonely Night" and "Mademoiselle Bruce" were skipped one after another. In March 1968, The Jaguars appeared in many televisions shows and there was a movie called "Make Way For The Jaguars" (directed by Yôichi Maeda and produced by Shochiku), but at the end of the same month, the band leader Yukio Miya withdrew due to internal conflict with the music directors. After Yukio left the group, 19 year old Takeshi Hamano joined the alternative drums in April and Shin became the leader of the group at the age of 20. In June, they released a hit song "The Legend of Xanadu" and in September with "Two People In The Starry Sky", but in January 1969, "Bruce for Lovers" was a remarkably popular song like other Group Sounds songs. It has been turned into a musical stage play.

Around this time, the GS genre began to fade as disco and funky music flourished in Japan, and lead guitarist Hisayuki Okitsu left the group due to illness treatment, and in 1970, keyboardist Yasuji Sato and Takeshi Hamano also left. After "Someday Someone" released in April 1970, they became active in nightclubs in Tokyo without a release song in 1971, but did not hold any dissolution concerts, and The Jaguars ended in July 1971.

Jack Stauber

Jack Stauber (born April 6, 1996) is an American musician, animator, and YouTuber from McKean, Pennsylvania who now lives in Pittsburgh. He is known for his strange lyrics and accompanying music videos on YouTube used as internet memes. Stauber has been a member of the bands Joose and Zaki. In 2020, he won the Shorty Award for Best in Weird.

His first album, "Finite Form" (2013), was released when he was 16. Inspired by folk music, his second album, "Viator" (2015), was released two years later. Stauber's third studio album "Pop Food" (2017) experimented with pop, lo-fi, and a 80s and 90s aesthetic. The first two tracks, "Buttercup" and "Oh Klahoma", went viral on TikTok, and has a combined 354 million Spotify streams as of May 2021. His latest album, "HiLo" (2018), has elements of funk, pop, and rock.

Stauber first published on YouTube in 2013. His website was launched in late 2017. The website mostly has links to other content such as his social media and merch stores. Stauber also has a Patreon, where he releases unreleased songs and videos monthly. He also releases full versions of short songs found on his YouTube channel. These full versions are usually released later under "Jack Stauber's Micropop".

Stauber grew up in McKean, Pennsylvania. He has one sister, named Kharly. He majored in marketing and minored in studio arts at the University of Pittsburgh. In an interview, Stauber showed his favorite cartoon is Rugrats, and liked the art style, stating "Take some time to watch a minute of the pilot of Rugrats if you haven’t seen that before. The art style is beyond incredible."

Stauber's most famous work, "Buttercup", is the first song released on his 2017 album "Pop Food". The song, along with remixes and covers of it, became a popular internet meme, especially on TikTok, which helped with its success. The song currently has 279 million Spotify streams as of May 2021. Stauber did not release an official music video for it. The song has been described as "bubbly, dramatic pop with Panda Bear-esque vocals." YouTuber "lisuga" made a popular fan made video using clips from the Japanese film, "Kick-Heart". It is the most viewed Jack Stauber-related video on YouTube, with 191 million views as of May 2021.

"Oh Klahoma", the second track from "Pop Food", also became popular. The song currently has 74 million Spotify streams as of May 2021. The song is most famously used as background music to a TikTok trend called #ghostphotoshoot, where creators dress up as ghosts and take photos of themselves, sometimes wearing sunglasses and other fashion accessories. However, the trend has become controversial, with critics saying the bedsheet costumes used look like KKK robes.

Stauber's visual style is known to be different, with some YouTube videos being dedicated to attempting to replicate the aesthetic that he utilizes in many of his videos. Stauber himself commented under one such video, expressing that he was impressed with the result. Meg Fair of "Pittsburgh City Paper" highlighted Stauber's knack of "pulling unrelated sounds and influences into [his] music" and liked his ability to switch styles quickly. Jenna Minnig of "PennState CommMedia" compared Stauber's music to Ariel Pink's; as both have hypnagogic-pop styles and have similar voices, but believed it was not needed to compare the two. Fans of his music include American rock musician Jon Bon Jovi, actor, rapper, and comedian Andy Milonakis, actor Verne Troyer, indie singer-songwriter Sidney Gish, and model Paris Jackson.

Along with music, Stauber is known for his animations. They are usually separated into three styles: "surreal", characters with odd and striking facial expressions and frequently part of his claymations, "colorful", which usually are featured in his VHS animations and music videos, and "Stauber faces", light-skinned characters with cartoon noses. Stauber is also well known for his frequent use of teeth in his videos and animations. He usually uses detailed resin teeth on his clay characters, although he has used real teeth. He has encouraged fans to send him teeth for him to use in his videos.Jack stauber also considers his style of art as "weirdcore". 

To make his animations, Stauber uses Microsoft Paint for the drawings. He then sequences the frames in Adobe Premiere Pro, and then runs the finished video through a VHS tape.

Stauber has four albums on both his Bandcamp and Spotify. Stauber uses the Plopscotch Records label to put copyright on his music.
Stauber also publishes under the name "Jack Stauber's Micropop", releasing longer versions of short songs found on his YouTube channel. These songs are less popular than his songs and albums released under his main name, Jack Stauber. These extended versions are often released early for Stauber's Patreon supporters. Under the Micropop name, Stauber has released six EPs and one compilation album, along with two soundtracks for his works with Adult Swim.

According to Meitei doctrines, he was regarded as a prophet who was born to preserve and revive the suppressed ancient paganism of the Meitei ethnicity. He is seen as an example for all Meiteis to follow. He invented a modern script (different from the present Meitei Mayek) to write Meitei language and its numerals taking help from the old script which he discovered from the Shakok Salai Thiren, based on the cosmic evolution of the Meitei mythology.
Still today, people celebrate his birthday on the month of Thawan (August) according to Meitei calendar both in Assam and Manipur.

Adele Bloch-Bauer

Adele Bloch-Bauer I (1881-1925) was an Austrian Jew who lived in Vienna. She supported many artists. Adele knew the painter Gustav Klimt. She is the only woman he painted more than once. People called her "the Austrian Mona Lisa." After her death, the Nazis stole the paintings from her family. Years later, her niece and some lawyers went to the United States Supreme Court to get them back.

Adele Bloch-Bauer was born Adele Bauer in 1881. Her father worked as a director for banks and railways.

Adele married Ferdinand Bloch when she was 19. He was 17 years older than she was. He liked her so much that instead of her becoming Adele Bloch, they both became Adele and Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer. They both liked many artists, including Gustav Klimt. She tried to have children with him, but two of them died before they were born and one baby died after.

Adele's sibling married Ferdinand's sibling, and all four of them used the same last name, Bloch-Bauer. Adele's sibling had two children.

Maria Altmann said her aunt was "rather cold, intellectual woman who was very politically aware and became a socialist. She wasn't happy. It was an arranged marriage but she was childless, after two miscarriages and the death of a baby. I remember her as extremely elegant, tall, dark and thin. She always wore a slinky white dress and used a long, gold cigarette holder."

Bloch-Bauer had parties for artists every week. Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss and Stefan Zweig came to the parties. Some of the educated people who came to the parties convinced Bloch-Bauer to support the poor and help women have the right to vote.

According to Klimt's website, Bloch-Bauer was his mistress. She is also the only woman he ever painted twice. Adele's husband, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, hired Klimt to paint both paintings. Klimt painted "Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I" in 1907 and "Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II" in 1912. Some artists also think Adele Bloch-Bauer might be the woman in "The Kiss" and "Judith and the Head of Holofernes". The first portrait was a gift from Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer to Adele's parents.

Adele Bloch-Bauer died of meningitis in 1925 when she was 43 years old.

During World War II, the Nazis stole "Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I" from Bloch-Bauer's family. It ended up in the Belvedere Gallery.

In "Republic of Austria v. Altmann" in 2004, Adele Bloch-Bauer's niece, Maria Altmann, tried to get the painting back from the Belvedere Gallery. The Supreme Court said the painting was Altmann's. Because Aultmann could not pay for insurance and storage, she sold the painting to Ronald Lauder to put in the Neue Gallery in New York City.

Bloch-Bauer had a large influence on modern art. Also, in 2016, the street Bloch-Bauer Promenade in Vienna was named after her and her husband.

The 2015 movie "Woman in Gold" is about Maria Altmann trying to get the painting back from the Belvedere Gallery. Adele Bloch-Bauer is shown in flashbacks.

Antiphon (music)

In Christian liturgy, an antiphon is the name of a short section, between the cleric, and usually the crowd. These sections are either spoken (the priest asks something, and the crowd gives a predefined answer, also spoken), or they are sung. When they are sung, the often use simple melodies. Antiphons are very old: In the 4th century they were used in what is called Ambrosian chant today. In liturgy, antiphons are not used on their own: the priest or person of the clergy says or chants these, while performing a ritual. In many pieces of church music, the choir (who replaces the crowd) starts singing as a response to an antiphon. 

In more modern forms of church music (such as Gospels, but also traditional African music), there's a tradition of call and response. A lead singer calls something, and the choir responds. 

Antiphon the Sophist

All of them were called Antiphon. 

Three works are attributed to Antiphon the Sophist
Antiphon was also a mathematician: By inscribing polygons on a circle he was able to give an upper and lower limit for the value of Pi.This was later used when people tried to square the circle.

Zuzu Angel

Zuleika Angel Jones (June 5, 1921 – April 14, 1976), better known as Zuzu Angel, was a Brazilian-American fashion designer. She became famous because she opposed the Brazilian military dictatorship after the forced disappearance of her son, Stuart. She was also the mother of journalist Hildegard Angel.

This dictatorship was backed by the CIA and the US government, at least for some time.

The National Truth Commission was created in 2014, to gather and review information about crimes committed during this dictatorship. A former agent of the dictatorship, called Cláudio Antônio Guerra confirmed that agents of the dictatorship were involved in the death of Angel.

Zuzu Angel was born on June 5, 1921, in Curvelo, Brazil. As a child, she moved to Belo Horizonte, later she lived in Bahia. Bahian culture and colors significantly influenced the style of Angel's creations. In 1947, she went to live in Rio de Janeiro, which was Brazil's capital city at the time.

In the 1950s, Angel began to work as a seamstress. She usually made clothing for close relatives. At the start of the 1970s, she opened a store in Ipanema. At that time, she also started to show her clothes on American catwalks. In her fashion expositions, she always used the joy and richness of the colours of Brazilian culture. This made her well known in the fashion world of her time.

Angel married an American salesman, Norman Angel Jones, and on January 11, 1946, they had a son, Stuart.

Stuart Angel was an undergraduate student at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's School of Economics when he joined the left-wing urban guerrilla group Revolutionary Movement 8th October ("Movimento Revolucionário 8 de Outubro" – MR-8). His fellow guerrillas gave him the codenames "Paulo" and "Henrique". He married fellow militant Sônia Maria Morais Angel Jones. His wife died in the custody of the military dictatorship's political police.

Officers of the Air Force Information Center ("Centro de Informações da Aeronáutica" – CISA arrested Stuart in the neighborhood of Grajaú, Rio de Janeiro on June 14, 1971. He was then taken under custody to CISA headquarters, where he was reportedly tortured. According to political prisoner Alex Polari, who claimed to have witnessed the incident, Stuart was then tied to the back of a jeep with his mouth glued to the vehicle's exhaust pipe and dragged through the courtyard of the Air Force base. This caused him to die from asphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning. His body was never found.

Alex Polari wrote a letter to Zuzu Angel explaining the circumstances of her son's death. Based on Polari's letter and other evidence, Angel reported the murder to Ted Kennedy, who revealed the case during a speech at the United States Senate. Angel also handed a letter to Henry Kissinger, who was Secretary of State of the United States at the time. This letter was a translation of Polari's letter. She also gave Kissinger a copy of the twentieth volume of the book "History of the Brazilian Republic" by Hélio Silva, in which Stuart's death is discussed. According to Silva, among the reactions of the regime to the protests of the American-Brazilian community were the removal and subsequent retirement of Brigadier João Paulo Burnier, who Polari accused of being responsible for Stuart's death. The Minister of the Air Force, Márcio de Sousa Melo was also dismissed.

Zuzu Angel was killed in a car crash on April 14, 1976. The suddenness of her death raised suspicions of government involvement; the case was investigated by the Comissão de Mortos e Desaparecidos Políticos (Commission on Political Deaths and Disappearances), under process number 237/96. This commission found many reasons to doubt the official version of events.

In 2014, the involvement of agents of the military repression regime in Brazil in her death was confirmed. A former agent named Cláudio Antônio Guerra, wrote the book Memories of a Dirty War. In this book he details several crimes in which he took part and he also revealed details about historical events of that time, among them the Riocentro May Day Attack, the death of Zuzu Angel and others.

Cláudio Antônio Guerra was the director of the Department of Political and Social Order, known as DOPS at the time. This department was well-known, because it was often involved in torture, extrajudicial killings and forced disappearance. Guerra said that army Colonel Freddie Perdigão had been present at the scene when the accident happened. Perdigau was a known torturer. In a photo taken at the scene of the accident that killed the stylist, Freddie Perdigão is seen standing close to the car. The photo had been taken on April 14, 1976 and was published on the day of disaster but Perdigão had not been identified in the photo until Guerra identified him to the members of the commission.

Stuart Angel is the patron of Juventude Revolucionária 8 de Outubro, MR-8's youth branch. MR-8 is now a faction of the Brazilian Democratic Movement.

The lyrics of the song "Cálice", written by Chico Buarque and Gilberto Gil make reference tp Stuart's probable death by asphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning. In homage to Zuzu Angel, and other mothers who were unable to bury their children, Buarque wrote the song "Angélica" in 1977.

In 2006, the events surrounding Stuart's death were dramatised in the "movie Zuzu Angel", directed by Sérgio Rezende. The movie, in which Daniel de Oliveira plays Stuart, is about Zuzu's struggle to find out the truth of her son's death.

The Tunnel Dois Irmãos, which connects Gávea to São Conrado, the same place where Zuzu's car crashed, was renamed after her.

In 2015, Angel was commemorated on her 94th birthday with a Google Doodle featuring a motif adapted from the prints she used in her designs.

Eggerland Episode 0: Quest of Rara

This game features much more advanced graphics than the previous Eggerland games. Most of them came out on home consoles that could only do graphics less advanced than most personal computers can do.

The game is saved instead of using passwords, making it easier for players to continue from where they were.

A new object called a Crystal Framer was added. It can be pushed, as can an Emerald Framer, and it blocks enemy movements and shots. However, when "Rara", known as Lala outside of Japan, shoots a shot, it is reflected clockwise or counter-clockwise, depending on the type of Crystal Framer, allowing her to put monsters such as Medusas or Don Medusas in eggs.

The game can be used to make level maps using "Construct Mode". All of the enemies, options and the terrains and their music that are available in the main game are available. These files are saved as "CONSTRUCT.TXT", and can be emailed to friends. They can also be shared online, which is normal in many Eggerland communities. Eggerland for Windows 95 and Revival! Eggerland haVE more available terrains and music files, but all releases can load the same files. However, "Eggerland 0" does not show their new terrain objects.

"CONSTRUCT.TXT" is played by default. If it is named "EGGLAND1.MAP" (for "Eggerland for Windows 95"/"Revival! Eggerland") or "EGGLAND0.MAP" (for "Episode 0") instead, custom maps can be played by selecting "New Game". Playing a custom map as a .MAP file instead of a .TXT file allows progress to be saved at any time, which is mainly helpful for long and difficult maps. However, the game's original file must be changed to something else, such as "EGGLAND1.ORIGINAL.MAP", to not overwrite the file.

M4 (105)

The M4 (105) was an M4 Sherman with 105 mm howitzer. It was a secondary version of the M4 Sherman, which was mainly used for personal protection reasons, although the tank also used high-explosive anti-tank missiles and was heavily armored.

A total of 6748 M4 (from July 1942 to January 1944) and 1641 of the late variant were produced with a 105 mm howitzer for infantry support, the M4 (105). Early models had the three-piece screwed nose, while later models had a mixed cast/rolled fuselage. The gun coat also evolved from the M34 to a more protective M34A. A known weakness of the early M4 was the slight flammability of the ammunition after a hit, especially because the cartridges were large howitzer cartridges, which then set the engine on fire or blew up the tank. However, many tanks of the states involved in the war had this problem. Because of this fire danger, the Sherman was also called "Ronson" by the crews (a well-known lighter brand with the advertising slogan "Ronson always burns!"), the Germans called it "Tommykocher". It was only with the M4, which was produced at the beginning of 1944, that this weakness was remedied by installing water tanks on the storage areas of the ammunition. This system, known as "wet congestion," reduced the fire risk by more than a factor of four after hitting the combat room.

LGBT rights in Peru

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in Peru may face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity is legal in Peru. However, houses headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for the same legal protections available to opposite-sex couples. 

In January 2017, the ex-president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski stabled a rule prohibiting all types of discrimination and hate crimes by sexual orientation. On January 9, 2017, a same-sex couple between a Peruvian citizen and a Mexican citizen started a process to legalize same-sex marriage between those. The 7th Constitutional Court of Lima was in favor of recognizing same-sex marriage, performed on Mexico after. However, the Supreme Court of Peru declined its request.

In the 1980s, a foundation called "Movimiento Homosexual de Lima" (MHOL) started to fight for more LGBT rights. It was founded by a LGBT activist and ex-politician Óscar Ugarteche. In 2014, there was some cases of discrimination against LGBT people in MHOL. One example was to the MHOL's president.

In their old civilizations, like the "Moche" and "Chimu" culture, homosexuality was seen as normal; there are ceramics about LGBT persons engaging in sexual activity between same-sex couples.

Peer-to-peer file sharing

There is an ongoing discussion related to the economic impact of P2P file sharing. 

The economic effect of copyright infringement under peer-to-peer file sharing on music has been controversial and hard to determine. Some unofficial studies found that file sharing had a negative impact on overall record sales.

The United States' Motion Picture Association of America said that American studios lost just over $2.373 billion to Internet piracy in 2005. That was about one third of the total cost of movie piracy in the United States. The estimate from the MPAA was doubted by commentators. It was based under the assumption that one download was the equivalent of one lost sale. Downloaders might not buy the movie if downloading was an option.

Yoichi Maeda (movie director)

Yôichi Maeda (前田陽一, "Maeda Yôichi", December 14, 1934 - May 3, 1998) is a Japanese movie director and screenwriter from Tatsuno, Hyogo Prefecture. He directed 17 movies for Shochiku and three for Toho. The best-known movie he directed is "Make Way For The Jaguars" from 1968, which became his well known musical comedy movie.

After graduating from Tatsuno High School and Waseda University School of Letters, Maeda joined the Shochiku Ofuna Film Studio in April 1958. He worked as an assistant director for Yoshishige Yoshida and Minoru Shibuya. In 1964, he made his first feature film debut as a director with "Nippon Paradise" (starring Yoshiko Kayama, along with Daisuke Katō, Mariko Kaga and Hiroyuki Nagato). Since then, he has been mainly focusing on comedy. 

After the decline of theatrical movies, Maeda switches to TV, worked on many television dramas, and co-represented the script-writing office "Ragus" with screenwriter Hideichi Nagahara. 

In 1998, he decided to make one last cinematic movie for the studio production "New Karajishi Co., Ltd." for the first time in a while, but he was hospitalized one week after filming it. Maeda died of liver failure on May 3, 1998. He was 63 years old. The filmed "New Karashishi Co., Ltd." was successfully completed and released by director Hideo Nanbu and screenwriter Hidetaka Nagahama, who were studying under director Maeda before. Directors Nanbu and writer Nagahama are credited as "cooperative directors", but they are still collaborated with by Yoichi Maeda.

He directed three movies for Toho with "Kigeki migimuke hidari!" (1970), "Kigeki kinō no teki wa kyō mo teki" and "Okite koronde mata okite" (1971). 

In his 1968 musical comedy movie, "Make Way For The Jaguars", Maeda used good and sounds like The Beatles vocal harmonies mixed with "Psychotic Reaction" type fuzz guitar and the screen goes trippy with psychedelic prism effects—makes you think The Jaguars must have been "experienced."

Full employment

Full employment is an idea from economics. It means that every person that is able and willing to work can get a job. It does not mean that all people have a job: People who do not have the skills the employers want may still not have a job, because there simply is no role that fits them. This is called "structural unemployment". Also, it is very likely that there will be people looking for jobs (called "frictional unemployment").

In general, people say there is full employment, if the percentage of people who are able and willing to work, but who do not have a job is below a given rate. In 1945, William Henry Beveridge said there was full employment if there are more jobs than job seekers. He said that an unemployment rate of three percent of frictional (short term) unemployment can be considered full employment.

The Elephant Whisperer

The Elephant Whisperer: My Life with the Herd in the African Wild is a book by Lawrence Anthony and Graham Spence about Anthony's own life. It was published in 2009, but it is about things that happened before 2003. Sidgwick & Jackson Ltd. published it. It is about a game preserve in South Africa called Thula Thula where a herd of elephants come to live.

Lawrence Anthony tells the reader about elephants who came to live at Thula Thula in 1999. They had been at a different game preserve, but they learned how to break through the electric fence and escape. This was bad because they ate people's crops and because any human who wanted to could kill them. The oldest elephant was shot by humans.

Usually, African game wardens did not talk to or go near the elephants because this can change their natural behavior. But these elephants were so angry at and afraid of humans that Anthony decided to do something different. He decided to make friends with them so they would not hate humans. In the book, he tells the reader how he became friends with the elephants, caught poachers, made deals with African humans who lived nearby, for example the Zulu king and chiefs, took care of a sick baby elephant, and ran the game preserve.

The audiobook recording of "The Elephant Whisperer" won an Audie Award for best biography or memoir.

Damiano David

Damiano David is an Italian singer and songwriter best known as the vocalist of the Italian rock band Måneskin, which won the Sanremo Music Festival 2021 and the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 (as the Italian representative in the latter) with the song "Zitti e buoni". He is noted for his "natural charisma of the great frontmen", and as an Italian fashion icon.

Damiano was born in Rome, Italy, to flight attendant parents. Due to the nature of his parents' work, he and his brother travelled worldwide from an early age and were introduced to various cultures. Until he was 17, he showed some talent playing basketball as a point guard at the local club Eurobasket Roma. He recalls that the basketball experience gave him fundamental discipline to succeed in his life.

Damiano started singing when he was only six years old. He met Victoria De Angelis, Thomas Raggi and Ethan Torchio, his future band members from Måneskin, during high school days. He studied at the liceo linguistico Eugenio Montale in Rome, but he did not complete high school and instead devoted himself to his music career, for which he also had the support of his parents. When introduced for the position of a vocalist for their local band, he was initially rejected because his style was considered "too pop", but his insistence to be in the band eventually got him accepted. Damiano soon changed his demeanor and style, especially his stage persona, because he learned how to freely express himself, as well as gaining confidence in his sexuality. The band was formed in 2016 and initially played as buskers in the streets of the city of Rome, but in 2017 they soon rose to prominence when they finished second in the eleventh season of the Italian talent show "X Factor". The band had a breakthrough debut with the studio album "Il ballo della vita" and tour in 2018 and 2019. In 2021, their second studio album "" was released.

After their win at the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 he was falsely accused of drug use during the final. Damiano and his bandmates have been anti-drug advocates since the beginning. Damiano himself stated in his "Vogue Italia" interview, "we are not falling into the stereotype of the alcoholic and drugged rock star". He believes that creativity comes from a "healthy, trained and lucid" mind and it is contradicting trying to truly express "our own self by binding ourselves to something that instead makes us dependent, slaves", also referring to the 27 Club.

Against numerous rumors about Damiano's personal life, in 2021 he announced that he has been dating Giorgia Soleri for almost four years.

Refinancing

Loan refinancing means taking out a new loan to pay off one or more outstanding loans. 

Borrowers usually do this to get lower interest rates or to otherwise reduce their repayments. It can also reduce or alter risk by switching between a variable-rate and a fixed-rate loan. 

Refinancing can be used to get a longer term loan with lower monthly payments. In these cases, the total amount paid will increase, as interest will have to be paid for a longer period of time. Some fixed-term loans have penalty clauses - a charge for early repayment of the loan, in part or in full. There are normally transaction fees on the refinancing.

Refinancing also means providing a central bank of commercial banks with additional reserves on a credit basis, such as borrowed reserves. The initiators of refinancing are commercial banks. They turn to the central bank when they cannot replenish their reserves from other sources.

Oswald Mosley

Sir Oswald Ernald Mosley, 6th Baronet (16 November 1896 – 3 December 1980) was a British fascist politician.

He rose to fame in the 1920s as a Member of Parliament and later became disillusioned with mainstream politics.

He became the leader of the British Union of Fascists (BUF). Mosley was the sixth baronet to hold the title, which had been in his family for over a century.

After belonging to both the Conservative Party and the Labour Party, Mosley set up his "New Party", which became the British Union of Fascists. He was anti-semitic (against jews), and there were street riots in London and Leicester in 1935.

Mosley was interned in May 1940, and the BUF was banned. He was released in 1943. Internment is putting people in prison to prevent their being able to act against the national interest. Its main use is to protect public safety. It has not been done in Britain since WWII.

Disgraced by his association with fascism, Mosley moved abroad in 1951. He spent most of the rest of his life in Paris.

Ring Tone Text Transfer Language

Ring Tone Text Transfer Language (RTTTL), also known as Nokring, was made by Nokia to allow ringtones to be moved to their cellphones.

This is an RTTTL ringtone. This one is named Haunted House:

codice_1

RTTTL has three parts, which are all separated by one colon each. All of them must be there.

RTTTL is defined in a similar way to Music Macro Language, which many early microcomputers have in their BASIC implementations.

These standard musical durations can be used:

Adding a period (".") character to the end of a note increases the length of the note by half, which can be used to make dotted rhythm patterns.

These pitches can be used:

RTTTL has 4 octaves, starting from the A below middle C and going up four octaves, because cellphones could not play some tones audibly at the time it was made. These octaves are numbered from lowest pitch to highest pitch from 4 to 7.

The octave should be left out of the note to prevent rests or pauses in the pattern.

Who Shot Mr. Burns?

"Who Shot Mr. Burns?" is an episode of The Simpsons in two parts. The first part is the 25th and last episode of the 6th season. The second part is the first episode of the 7th season. Both parts were first broadcast on the Fox network. The first part was broadcast on May 21, 1995 and the second part was broadcast on September 17, 1995. In the first part, oil is found at the Springfield Elementary School. Mr. Burns takes all of the oil and tries to make everyone in Springfield angry. Mr. Burns later gets shot by someone. In the second part, the police in Springfield try to find the person who shot Mr. Burns. They believe the suspects are Mr. Smithers and Homer Simpson. 

Both of the parts were written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein. The first part was directed by Jeffrey Lynch and the second part was directed by Wes Archer. Tito Puente guest starrs in both parts. The idea of the story came from Matt Groening (creator of "The Simpsons"). The writers made his idea become an episode with two parts. The first part has many clues for who shot Mr. Burns becaues the writers wanted people to be able to figure it out. The episode's story came from the "Dallas" episode "A House Divided", where J. R. Ewing gets shot. Before the second part was broadcast, fans debated on who shot Mr. Burns. Fox started a contest about it over the summer of 1995.

At the Springfield Elementary School, Groundskeeper Willie makes a hole to put a dead classroom pet in. He finds oil under the school and makes the school rich. Principal Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers ask the students and teachers on how they should use the money. Student Lisa Simpson wants them to hire Tito Puente as a music teacher. 

At the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer is sad because his bossboss Mr. Burns keeps forgetting his name. His wife Marge tells him to give Burns a box of chocolates with a picture of the family under it. Burns and his assistant Mr. Smithers eat all of the chocolates except for the one above Homer's face. Burns writes a card that thanks only Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. This makes Homer start feeling angry.

Mr. Burns thinks of a way to take the oil from the school. He makes people build a slant drill. The drill gets all of the oil before the school can get any. The slant drill causes many problems for the people in Springfield. Groundskeeper Willie and Tito Puente must be fired from the school. Moe Szyslak must close down his tavern because of the oil's fumes. The retirement home Grampa Simpson lives at gets destroyed and must live at the Simpson family's house. The slant drill throws oil at Bart's treehouse, which destroys the treehouse and breaks Santa's Little Helper's legs.

Burns tells Smithers that he has built a machine that will block the sun in Springfield. He hopes this will take away all of the sunlight and will make people buy his electricity. Smithers tells Burns that he is hurting too many people, which makes Burns fire Smithers. Homer gets very angry at Burns for not knowing his name. He quietly goes into Burns' office and writes "I am Homer Simpson" on a wall with spray paint. Burns sees him but still does not remember his name. Homer attacks Burns and gets taken away by Burns' security guards.

The people in Springfield start a town meeting to talk about what Burns has done to them. Burns goes to the town meeting with a gun to defend himself. He starts the machine that blocks the sun. He walks away into an alley and gets shot. Burns becomes weak and falls on a sundial. Many people in Springfield find him on the sundial. Marge says that since he made many people angry, everyone there is a suspect. Chief Wiggum says that he will get the police to start an investigation.

Mr. Burns is taken to a hospital. Smithers says that he remembers shooting someone, but does not remember who he shot. Smithers believe he has shot Burns and talks about it at a church, where he gets arrested. When he gets shown on television, Smithers references an episode of a fake show on Comedy Central. Sideshow Mel knows what he is referencing and tells police that Smithers is innocent. He says this because Smithers was watching the episode when Mr. Burns was shot. Smithers said in the town meeting that he always watches the show. He then remembers that he actually shot an elderly man with a leg made out of wood. 

Lisa helps the police with the investigation. They talk to other suspects and find that they are innocent. Tito Puente says that he would not shoot Burns, but instead he would perform a mambo song about it. Skinner was putting make-up on when Chalmers finds him doing so. Willie can not shoot with a gun since he has arthritis in his fingers. Moe gets put on a polygraph (lie detector) that says he did not shoot Burns. A dream tells Wiggum to look in the suit Burns was wearing when he was shot. They find DNA on the suit that is from anyone in the Simpson family. Mr. Burns wakes up at the hospital and yells "Homer Simpson!" The police raid the Simpsons' house and find a gun under their car's seats. The gun has Homer's fingerprints and the bullets in the gun are the same kind that were used to shoot Mr. Burns. Homer gets arrested and is put in a police van. At a restaurant drive-thru, the police van falls over and lets Homer run out of the van. 

The doctors at the hospital learn that "Homer Simpson" are the only words Burns can say. Lisa investigates where Burns was shot to see if there is anything that shows that Homer did not shoot him. The police learn that Homer is in the hospital that Burns is at. They go to Burns' room and find Homer shaking him. Burns can now speak normally but forgets Homer's name again. Homer gets very angry and points a gun at Burns' head. Burns laughs and says that Homer did not shoot him. He then tells everyone who really shot him: Maggie. 

He tells the story of how Maggie shot him. After he left the town meeting, he finds Maggie with a lollipop in the Simpsons' car. He tries to take the lollipop, but Maggie will not let him. Burns takes it, but his gun falls out of his suit. The gun falls on Maggie's hands, who accidentally shoots him. Homer later leaves fingerprints on the gun while trying to find something he dropped under the seats. When Burns fell on the sundial, he moved his arms to the "S" (south) and "W" (west) sides of the sundial. Lisa believes that he saw the "W" as an "M" and put his arms there to show who shot him. Burns tells Lisa that he did not know he moved his arms in that way. He says that he wants Maggie to be arrested, but Chief Wiggum tells him that she is too young to be arrested.

Matt Groening got the idea to make an episode where Mr. Burns was shot. He thought this idea could be used to get more people's attention. The writers wanted the episode to be in two parts with a mystery that could be used for a contest. They made it so that the mystery had clues, had hidden images, and that it would be easy to understand who shot Burns. Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein (the writers of the episode) got the idea for Barney Gumble to be the one who shot Mr. Burns. David Mirkin wanted Maggie to do it because he thought it would be funnier if someone from the Simpson family did it.

Producers of "The Simpsons" wanted to make sure not many people knew who did it. David Silverman was the only animator who knew it while the episode was being made. Wes Archer (director of the second part) did not know that Maggie shot Mr. Burns. Silver and Archer did not work on the animation of the ending until summer in 1995. They made other animators do smaller work so that they did not know who did it. In the table-read (when the show's staff read the script) of the episode, they did not read the ending. Parts of the animation had to be made again so that it got the clues to the mystery. Oakley and Weinstein were not sure if Maggie should have done it, so they made the ending seem as if Maggie may not have shot Mr. Burns accidentally.

Tito Puente and his Latin jazz ensemble were in the episode. They sing the song "Señor Burns". Oakley and Weinstein did not know Puente well enough. They let him in the episode because Groening is a fan of Puente. They thought he would sing the song, but they later learned that Puente is a drummer and is not a singer. One person from his ensemble sung the song instead.

Many hidden clues were put in the first part for people who wanted to figure out who shot Mr. Burns.


David Mirkin wrote many "terrible endings" because the episode was very popular at the time. Harry Shearer voice acted for the different endings. Mirkin wanted to trick the people working on the episode and wanted to show it to the media. However, this was not able to happen. Many of the different endings were animated to show other characters shooting Mr. Burns. Some of these were shown in the episode "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular". That episode showed Barney, Tito, Moe, Apu, and Santa's Little Helper shooting him. Another ending was made with Mr. Burns in the hospital to show that Smithers had shot him. In that ending, Lisa says he falls on the "S" and "W" sides of the sundial because they are the first letters of Smithers' first and last names.

Many years after the episodes were first broadcast, fans have made theories that other characters may have shot Mr. Burns instead of Maggie. On April 2020, one fan said on Reddit that Homer Simpson made himself look like Krusty the Clown when the people in Springfield first find Burns to be shot. The fan used the episode "Homie the Clown" to prove the theory. In that episode, Homer makes himself look like Krusty and makes people think he actually is him. Krusty did not wear a bowtie at the town hall, but he is seen with one near the sundial. Bill Oakley later said that this was not suppose to happen. He also said that animators were told not to put Homer in the ending of the first part.

Before the second part was broadcast, many fans debated over who shot Mr. Burns. Fox started a contest where people who called the telephone number 1-800-COLLECT would be able to say who they think shot Mr. Burns. This contest lasted from August 13 to September 10. Fox started a website about the episodes. More than 500,000 people went on the website in the summer of 1995. The person who won the contest would get to be animated in an episode. The contest rules said that the winner had to be chosen from a random sample of people, even if none of the people in the sample got it right. The random sample that was chosen did not have any right answers. A winner was picked at random out of that sample, who was Fayla Gibson of Washington D.C. Gibson did not want to be in the show and instead got cash for winning.

A television special named Springfield's Most Wanted was broadcast before the second part on September 17, 1995. It was hosted by John Walsh, who is the host of "America's Most Wanted". The special was made to help people figure out who shot Mr. Burns. It shows clues from the first part and talks about suspects of the mystery. Daryl Gates, Dennis Franz, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Kevin Nealon, Chris Elliott, and Andrew Shue talk about who they think did it in the special. Jimmy Vaccaro from The Mirage talked about the odds of who shot Mr. Burns. He said that the odds for Homer are big, with odds of 2:1. Maggie did not have good odds with 70:1. Critics did not like the special. They thought it made the episodes look more popular than they really are.

In 2003, "Entertainmeny Weekly" made a list of 25 episodes of "The Simpsons" they thought were the best. They put both parts of "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" as 25th on the list and called it ""The Simpsons" most pop moment ever". "The Daily Telegraph" and "Entertainment.ie" named the episodes one of the 10 greatest "Simpsons" episodes ever. When "The Simpsons" was put on Disney+, Oakley said that the first part is one of the best episodes to watch there.

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood (authors of "I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide") thought that the first part was a great way to end the sixth season. They said "it's a genuine whodunnit. There's no cheating - all the clues are there." Jake Rossen from "Wizard" put the first part's ending on his list of the best cliffhangers. However, he felt disappointed when it was shown to be Maggie who shot Mr. Burns. He said "Sometimes it's better to make up your own ending, kids." "Entertainment Weekly" put the first part on their list of best season finales (last episode of a season).

The song "Señor Burns" got a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award in 1996. Alf Clausen is the composer of the song and Oakley and Weinstein (the episode's writers) also wrote the lyrics.

Black nationalism

Black nationalism is the idea that black people from one country, or from several countries belong together, and that they have a common history and culture. Sometimes, people claim there is a black race. Black nationalism started in the United States as a response to McCarthyism. McCarthyism lasted approximately form the mid 1940s, to the mid 1950s. During McCarthyism, there was a strong anti-communist movement in the US. At the same time, there were many racist ideologies. In the United States, these tendencies focused on the white Anglo-Saxon protestants, who was seen as the ideal American citizen. Black nationalism wants to create a new nation for black Americans.

Keiretsu

A keiretsu is a group of businesses that work together. There are keiretsu in Japan.

The companies in the keiretsu each own shares of each other's stock. Sometimes, there is a bank at the middle of a keiretsu. These are called horizontal keiretsu.

Keiretsu can also have some companies that make supplies that other companies in the keiretsu need. These are called vertical keiretsu.

Not all countries allow keiretsu. For example, in the United States, keiretsu are illegal. They are against antitrust laws.

The keiretsu started after World War II during the American occupation of Japan. Before there were keiretsu, there were zaibatsu. The zaibatsu were also business groups, but they were owned by families. The zaibatsu supported the military government of Japan from the 1800s through World War II, so the Americans broke them up after the war.

In the 1990s, there was a financial crisis in East Asia. Most of the companies in keiretsu decided to cut costs. This weakened the keiretsu because each company wanted to get the best deal, even if it wasn't with a company in its own keiretsu. Japan made treaties with other countries that required it to break up some of the keiretsu because of antitrust laws.

Shibuya Crossing

Shibuya Crossing, or Shibuya Scramble Crossing, is a popular scramble crossing in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan. It is located in front of the Shibuya Station Hachikō exit and stops vehicles in all directions to allow pedestrians to inundate the entire intersection. The statue of Hachikō, between the station and the intersection, is a very common meeting place and almost always crowded.

This intersection is frequently called "the most busiest pedestrian intersection in the world" and there is almost no loss of foot traffic at midnight or early morning. Road traffic jams rarely occur here even during rush hours.

According to the Shibuya Center Street in 2016, the number of pedestrians crossing the intersection was as much as 3,000 per green light (every 2 minutes). A 2014 flow measurement survey by the Shibuya Redevelopment Association estimated 260,000 pedestrians per day on week days, and 390,000 pedestrians on non-working days. Others estimate as much as 500,000 people on the busiest days. The 2012 SOTO Outdoor Media Survey estimated 1.5 million pedestrians per week.

Time crystal

A time crystal is a quantum system that has repeating periodic oscillations of one or more physical measurements in its ground state when seen over time.

Just as an ordinary crystal is seen to have its atoms arranged in repeating patterns in space, so a time crystal has a repeating patterns that occur over time. 

In 2012, the American Nobel Prize winner Frank Wilczek proposed the concept of a time crystal.

In 2017 the atomic physicist Chris Monroe and his group found evidence of oscillations in optically excited chains of ytterbium ions with the behavior predicted for time crystals but not in the same way theorized in 2012.

In 2021, "for the first time, physicists have filmed the oscillation of a time crystal", media said.

In early 2024, The Technical University of Dortmund said that they had made a time crystal that lasted forty minutes.

In terms of practical use, time crystals may one day be used as quantum memories. 

The term "time crystal" has also been used in science fiction to refer to various unrelated fictional devices.


Croatian kuna

The Croatian kuna, was the currency used in Croatia. It's subunit was Lipa. It was used as the official currency since 1994, before it was replaced by the euro on 1 January 2023. Before 1994, Croatia used the Croatian dinar and before that it used the Yugoslav dinar. The kuna was issued by the Croatian National Bank and the coins were minted by the Croatian Monetary Institute. The plural form of the word kuna in Croatian can be "kuna" or "kune" (e.g. "2 kune", "10 kuna"). The word "kuna" means "marten" in Croatian.

Commemorative coins of the Croatian kuna have been issued since 1994.
The notes were designed by Miroslav Šutej and Vilko Žiljak, and all feature prominent Croatians on front and architectural motifs on back. The geometric figures at lower left on front (except the 5-kuna note) are intaglio printed for recognition by the blind people. To the right of the coat of arms on front is a microprinted version of the Croatian national anthem, Lijepa naša domovino ("Our Beautiful Homeland"). The overall design is reminiscent of Deutsche Mark banknotes of the fourth series.

The first series of notes was dated 31 October 1993. The 5, 10 and 20 kuna notes from this series were withdrawn on 1 April 2007, and the 50, 100 and 200 kuna notes were withdrawn on 1 January 2010, but remain exchangeable at the HNB in Zagreb.

New series of notes with slightly tweaked, but similar designs and improved security features were released in 2001, 2004, 2012 and 2014.

Claudius James Erskine

Claudius James Erskine (20 May 1821–6 June 1893) was a British civil servant, judge, educator, and orientalist. Erskine was part of the Indian Civil Service, and worked for the Governor of Bombay, Sir George Arthur. Erskine was a scholar and translator, and he worked in the government's Persian department. He worked to improve education, and became the first "director of public instruction" in the west of India. He was also a judge and a legislator. He was the third vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta.

Claudius James Erskine was born on 20 May 1821 at Bombay in the East India Company's Bombay Presidency. He was the son of William Erskine, a historian and civil servant from Edinburgh who worked in India. Claudius James was the second of William Erskine's sons. His mother was Maitland Mackintosh. She was the second daughter of James Mackintosh.

Erskine went to both the University of St Andrews and the University of Edinburgh. Then he studied at the East India Company College at Haileybury in Hertfordshire.

He returned to Bombay in 1840. In 1843, Erskine became the private secretary of Sir George Arthur, the governor of the Bombay Presidency. In 1847, Erskine became deputy secretary in the government's Persian department and a translator. Then he became secretary of the Bombay government's general department and its judicial department.

In 1854, Erskine published his father's work on the early Mughal Empire. William Erskine had died in 1852, before he finished the book, so his son Claudius finished the work and published it as "A History of India under the Two First Sovereigns of the House of Taimur, Báber and Humáyun". In 1855, Erskine became director of public instruction. He was the first person in this position in western India. During 1859 he was a judge in the Konkan region. In 1860 he became a member of the new Imperial Legislative Council.

On 8 April 1862, Erskine became vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta, after William Ritchie. In 1862, Erskine started to be a judge on the Bombay high court. On 26 March 1863, Erskine stopped being vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta, and Henry Sumner Maine became vice-chancellor.

In 1865, Erskine became a member of the Bombay Legislative Council. In April 1866, Erskine joined the Bombay Geographical Society and became its president.

In 1867 Erskine retired. In March 1867 he resigned the presidency of the Bombay Geographical Society and planned to return to Europe.

Erskine had retired for health reasons. He returned to Britain and died near Hyde Park, London, on 6 June 1893.

In 1847, Erskine married Emily Georgina Reid, daughter of Lestock Reid. Erksine's new father-in-law was acting as the governor of Bombay at that time.
Erskine had a collection of objects and manuscripts from Asia. Some of these are now in the British Museum and the British Library.

One manuscript in the British Library ("Additional manuscript" 26319) has five different texts in four languages. The British Museum bought this manuscript from Erskine in February 1865. From 1811 are two Kurdish language glossaries that Muhammad Husain Khan made for John Malcolm at Bushehr, one a Persian–Laki glossary, the other a Persian–Ardalani glossary. Another is a Kurdish–English glossary. From the 19th century is a glossary of words in the Persian language and the Chagatai language, with words from the "Baburnama" of Babur. The final work in this manuscript is an anonymous work in Persian with the name in . This work is on the subject of metaphysics and consciousness. The copy of the "Jām-i Jahānnamāī"'s date is 1141 "anno Hegirae" (1729 CE). Erskine himself probably bound these five manuscripts into the present manuscript codex.

In 1886, when Erskine was living in London, he sold more of his collection. The British Museum bought from Erskine an brass astrolabe with a silver inlay. Erskine's astrolabe was from Iran, and made in the 16th or 17th centuries, during the Safavid Empire. Before Erskine owned the astrolabe, Claudius Rich was its owner. (Rich was a relative of Erskine's because Rich had married Erskine's mother's older sister, Mary Mackintosh.) Rich had got the astrolabe in Yazd. The British Museum paid Erskine £18 for it. The museum also bought other things from Erskine that year. Erskine had got from Rich a sword and sheath from the Ottoman Empire that were from the 16th or 17th centuries. The British Museum bought these in 1886. The next year, the British Museum bought more of Erskine's objects.

Educational research

Educational research investigates how people learn. Literacy was the first starting-point. Before about 1470 all books were hand-written. Printing made the word visible. Before 1800 most ordinary people could not read or write. That was true for all countries. By 1900 most people in the most industrial countries could read. The Bible was one of the causes: people wanted to read the Bible in Christian countries. Just as important was industrialization. With industry grew a need for instruction, and there were printed rule books in key industries such as the railways. Church registers in England show increasing literacy as judged by the ability of men to sign their names. Previously, if a man signed with an X, a church clerk added his name.

An enormous amount of research has been done in the United States, and very much less elsewhere
Researching comes in many ways. Researches here focuses more on how people gather new things into their minds. These people could be learners or teachers. Both can interact in spaces of learning. These spaces are also known as classrooms. So researchers collect data inside classrooms, more or less. 

Educational researchers believe that the way they do research must be careful and well-ordered. First is on the basis of comparison. Second is on principles to set that everyone follows. Third is on how researchers do their research. Also, they borrow concepts from other studies, may it be about minds, society, human beings, and reasoning. The same goes for how they do their research.

There have been many attempts to bring together the skills and the knowledge needed by teachers. The following (mostly multi-author) books are examples.

The American Educational Research Association publishes many journals on teaching.

Jerky

Jerky is lean and trimmed meat that has been cut into strips and dried (dehydrated) so it will not spoil. Normally, the drying includes adding salt. It prevents the growth of bacteria before the meat has finished the dehydrating process. The word "jerky" is from the Quechua word "ch'arki". The word means "dried, salted meat".

Store-bought jerky often has sweeteners, like brown sugar.

Jerky is ready-to-eat, does not need to be prepared further and can be stored for months without being chilled.

Most fat must be trimmed from the meat before drying. Fat increases the chance of spoilage. (Modern vacuum packing and preservatives have helped stop these risks.) The meat must be dried quickly during the critical period where the meat is not yet dry.

Data lake

A data lake is a storage repository that can store a large amount of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. It is a place to store every type of data in its native format with no fixed limits on account size or file. It offers high data quantity to increase analytic performance and native integration.

A data lake is like a large container which is very similar to real lake and rivers. Just like in a lake you have multiple tributaries coming in, a data lake has structured data, unstructured data, machine to machine, logs flowing through in real-time.

The data lake democratizes data and is a cost-effective way to store all data of an organization for later processing. Research analysts can focus on finding meaning patterns in data and not data itself.

Unlike a hierarchal data warehouse where data is stored in files and folders, a data lake has a flat architecture. Every data elements in a data lake is given a unique identifier and tagged with a set of metadata information.

Ratatoskr

In Norse mythology, Ratatoskr is a squirrel that lives on the tree Yggdrasil. Ratatoskr carries messages between the eagle at the top of Yggdrasil, and the serpent Níðhöggr, at the bottom. Ratatoskr occurs both in the "Poetic Edda" and the "Prose Edda". The "Poetic Edda" is a collection of earlier stories. It was written in the 13th century. The "Prose Edda" was also written in the 13th century.

In the "Poetic Edda" poem "Grímnismál", the god Odin (disguised as "Grímnir") says that Ratatoskr runs up and down Yggdrasil bringing messages between the eagle perched atop it and Níðhöggr below it:

Ratatoskr is described in the "Prose Edda"s "Gylfaginning" chapter 16, in which High states that

An eagle sits at the top of the ash, and it has knowledge of many things. Between its eyes sits the hawk called Vedrfolnir [...]. The squirrel called Ratatosk [...] runs up and down the ash. He tells slanderous gossip, provoking the eagle and Nidhogg.


Microkini

A micro bikini (or microkini) is a bikini, a bathing suit for women. Like a bikini, it is made of two parts, a top, and a slip. The slip usually only covers the labiae, the top only covers the nipples. Microkinis were developed in the 1970s, because nudism was outlawed in many parts of the United States. Many microkini models are transparent. They usually do not cover the buttocks. There are versions which are just made of straps of fabric which cover almost nothing. Before wearing a micro bikini, women usually shave at least part of their pubic hair.

Pasties can be seen as a variant of a microkini: Unlike a top, which is made of fabric, pasties are made of plastic; they are not kept in place with cords.

Microkini designs for men were introduced at the end of the 1960s consisting of briefs that barely covered the penis and the pubic hair. These micro bikinis for men have continued to be popular in Brazil, particularly in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro. During the 1980s the popularity of highly revealing thongs such as those found in the microkini meant that Brazilian waxing to remove most of the hair from the pubic area also became more poular. 

In 1995 fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld created a micro bikini for Chanel’s spring 1996 collection. It resembled a string bikini except that the top's triangles were replaced with two small circles resembling nipple pasties.

Microkinis keep the wearer just within legal limits of decency. They fill a niche between nudism and conservative swimwear. In Europe the wearing of microkinis at beaches or hotels or public pools is often allowed. It may be considered inappropriate in more conservative societies. Wearing them in public is prohibited in some places by local laws which can carry a fine.

As a young man, the people of Greece were optimistic that Otto would be a great king as he was the first king of modern Greece after the Greeks suffered under the Ottoman Empire.

During his reign however, Greece was very unstable because he did not care about the people. He heavily taxed them, was not Greek Orthodox but was Roman Catholicism, invited more people from Bavaria to come to Greece, his closest advisors were Bavarian rather than Greek, and he could not speak Greek because he did not bother learning it.

Street fighting

Street fighting is hand-to-hand combat in public places, between several people. The fight sometimes results in serious injury or even death. Some street fights are gang-related.

A usual situation might involve two people arguing in a bar. One steps outside. A fight begins.

Being involved in a street fight often results in public disorder. Any people fighting "may" be charged by the police. Practice varies between countries, and even between towns. If any injuries are caused in the fight, the severity of the injury may determine the sentence and fine of the participants.

A "bar fight", or "bar brawl", is a street fight which happens in bars or taverns.

Thatgamecompany

Thatgamecompany, Inc. is an American independent video game development company founded by students Jenova Chen and Kelle Santiago in 2006.

In late 2005, Jenova Chen and Kellee Santiago, students of the Interactive Media Program at the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts, began thinking about creating their own video game company. The two had just released a video game—"Cloud"—that they had developed with several other students. The game was a success. This circumstance allowed students to think about creating their own company. The games should evoke emotions in players. 

Digital distribution was popularity at the time. The two saw it as opportunity to create games without financial risk of retail distribution. Thatgamecompany was founded on May 15, 2006, as Chen and Santiago finished their master's degrees. The company soon signed a deal with Sony Computer Entertainment, which had been impressed by Chen's Flash game "Flow".

Antiziganism

Antiziganism or antigypsyism, is fear and hatred of Sinti and Romani people. There has been antiziganism in Europe since at least 1300 c.e.

The Romani people are discriminated against in many countries. Sometimes they were even murdered. Between the 1500s and the 1700s, Romani men could be hanged without a trial in many countries.

Muslim Roma face double discrimination, they suffer from antiziganism and islamophobia

Harmful untrue information against the Romani people is spread worldwide. Unfortunately, the Romani people are blamed for many things by other peoples. As example, dubious sources claimed, that Talat Pasha who belogend to the Turks from Bulgaria, have been the son of a Romani mother and a Pomak father, which is simply not true. He had nothing to do with the Romani people from Bulgaria. This is done, to deny his turkish origins and to blame the Romani people.

Early 1990s recession in the United States

The United States entered recession in 1990. It lasted eight months until March 1991. The recession was mild compared to other recessions post-World War II. However, it was marked by a substandard recovery, also called a jobless recovery. Unemployment continued to rise until June 1992 even though a positive economic growth had returned the year before.

July 1990 was the end of what was then the longest peacetime expansion in United States history. The United States had major job growth and declining unemployment before the 1990s recession. The hardest hit regions were New England and the West Coast of the United States. The Midwest was less affected.

Job losses and unemployment kept rising and hit 7.8% in June 1992. 

Other factors led to a slow economy. The factors included a dip in office construction due to too much building in the 1980s. Local markets in New England, Texas and Southern California went through the effects of too much commercial building.

Lesbian bar

The lesbian bar (also called a dyke bar or women's bar) is a bar for lesbians. The lesbian bar has a history different from gay bars.

Lesbian bars existed before queer community centers, health care centers and coffee shops. For a long time, lesbian bars were places of community and validation.

Women were historically barred from public spaces having alcoholic drinks. The women's saloon presence rose in the 1920s. Mona's 440 Club was the first lesbian bar in the United States. In the 1950s, bars began opening for working class lesbians, Caucasian or African American. Because of not enough economic capital and segregation, house parties were popular with the black lesbians.

Lesbian and gay identification and bar culture increased with the migration and passing through of people in big cities during and after World War II. In the 1970s, lesbian feminism began. Bars became important community activist spaces.

R.O.S.E. (Jessie J album)

R.O.S.E. is the fourth studio album by English singer-songwriter Jessie J. It was released by Republic Records in four parts, starting on 22 May 2018, and finishing on 25 May 2018, with a part being released on each day. The four parts released are R (Realisations), O (Obsessions), S (Sex) and E (Empowerment). Jessie co-wrote the album and worked with producers such as DJ Camper and Kuk Harrell.
"Renowned for Sound" gave "R.O.S.E." 3.5 out of 5 stars, with Rachael Scarsbrook saying that "splitting an album into four chunks is a brave move for a popstar, in a genre when fans are a little more casual and expect everything to be delivered to them in one all consuming format. That said, "R.O.S.E." feels like Jessie J almost fully rejecting her more mainstream appeal in order to put out a collection of tracks that mean a great deal to her on a more personal level. It might not be the kind of thing I normally go for, but as a project it's actually quite skilled and enjoyable."

All tracks written by Jessica Cornish and Darhyl Camper, except where noted. All tracks produced by Camper, except where noted.

Wow! signal

The Wow! signal was a strong radio signal received on August 15, 1977, by Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope in the United States, which was being used at the time in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The signal appeared to come from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius and met all the expectations of a signal of extraterrestrial origin.

Astronomer Jerry R. Ehman found the signal a few days after it was received while reviewing printout of the data collected by the telescope. He was so impressed by the strength of the signal that he circled the text that represented it, "6EQUJ5", and wrote the comment "Wow!" on its side, leading to the event's widely used name.

The entire signal was detected for the full 72-second window during which Big Ear was able to observe it, but has not been detected since, even though many, such as Ehman, have tried. Many explanations have been given on where the signal comes from, including natural and human-made sources, but none of them have been accepted by scientists as good enough to fully explain the signal.

Although the Wow! signal did not have any known encoded message, it remains the strongest candidate for an alien radio transmission ever detected.

In a 1959 paper, Cornell University physicists Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi hypothesized that any extraterrestrial civilization trying to communicate with radio signals might do so using a frequency of megahertz ( centimeters), because is naturally emitted by hydrogen, which is the most common element in the universe, and is likely familiar to all technologically advanced civilizations.

In 1973, after completing a survey of radio sources coming from other galaxies, Ohio State University assigned the Ohio State University Radio Observatory (nicknamed "Big Ear") to the scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), in the longest-running program of this kind in history. The radio telescope was located near the Perkins Observatory on the campus of Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio.

In 1977, Ehman was working at the SETI project as a volunteer; his job involved going through large amounts of data processed by a computer and recorded on paper. While looking at the data collected on August 15 at 22:16 EDT (02:16 UTC), he noticed a series of values showing signal strength and frequency that left him and others amazed.
The event was later documented in detail by the observatory's director.

The string 6EQUJ5 is commonly misunderstood as a message encoded in the radio signal. This string actually represents the signal's strength over time, expressed in the particular measuring system adopted for the experiment. The signal itself did not appear to change in a way that would have allowed for a message to be encoded, although any change that would have happened in less than 10 seconds or longer than 72 seconds would not have been detectable. The signal did, however, have a continuous wave.

The signal strength was measured by how much more powerful it was than the average background noise over the previous few minutes. The signal was sampled for 10 seconds and then processed by the computer, which took 2 seconds. Meaning that every 12 seconds the strength for each different frequency channel was printed as a single number or letter that represented the 10-second average strength, minus the strength of the background noise.

On this scale, an empty space was left for strengths between 0 and 1 standard deviations higher than the background noise. The numbers 1 to 9 showed how many standard deviations above the background noise the signal strength was. If the strength of the signal was 10 or above it would be indicated by a letter: "A" corresponded to a strength of 10, "B" to 11, "C" to 12, and so on. The Wow! signal's highest measured value was "U" (a strength of 30), making it thirty standard deviations above background noise.John Kraus, the director of the observatory, gave a value of in a 1994 summary written for Carl Sagan. However, Ehman in 1998 gave a value of . This is () above the hydrogen line value (with no red- or blue-shift) of . If due to blue-shift, it would mean the source was moving about towards Earth. An explanation of the difference between Ehman's value and Kraus's can be found in Ehman's paper.

The Wow! signal was a narrowband emission: meaning its bandwidth was less than kHz. The Big Ear telescope was able to measure fifty kHz-wide channels. The output from each channel was represented in the computer printout as a a different column with the number or letters printed on it representing the strength of the signal at that range. The Wow! signal is only in one column.
At the time the signal was heard, the Big Ear radio telescope was only adjustable for altitude (or height above the horizon), and used the spinning of the Earth to listen across the sky. Given how fast the Earth spins, and how big the telescope's observation window is, the Big Ear could listen to any given point in the sky for just 72 seconds. This means that a continuous extraterrestrial signal would only be able to be heard for exactly 72 seconds, and the recorded strength of such signal would display an increase for the first 36 seconds—peaking at the center of the observation window—and then a decrease as the telescope moved away from it. All these characteristics are present in the Wow! signal.

The exact spot in the sky where the signal came from is unclear because of the design of the Big Ear telescope. The telescope had two different structures (called feed horns) that listened to the sky, and both listened to the sky in slightly different directions, and would be moved along the sky by the Earth's spin. The Wow! signal was heard in one of these feed horns, but not in the other, and the data was processed in a way that makes it is impossible to determine which of the two horns heard the signal. Making two different spots in the sky where the signal could have come from.

The galactic coordinates for the positive horn are =11.7°, =−18.9°, and for the negative horn =11.9°, =−19.5°, both being therefore about 19° toward the southeast of the galactic plane, and about 24° or 25° east of the galactic centre. The region of the sky in question lies northwest of the globular cluster M55, in the constellation Sagittarius, roughly 2.5 degrees south of the fifth-magnitude star group Chi Sagittarii, and about 3.5 degrees south of the plane of the ecliptic. The closest easily visible star is Tau Sagittarii.

No nearby sun-like stars were within the are that was being listened to, although in any direction the antenna pattern would encompass about six stars that are far away.

There are a number of hypotheses as to what the Wow! signal is, and where it came from. Scientists have not gotten behind any one of these ideas. Interstellar twinkling of a weaker signal—similar in effect to twinkling of stars in the sky—could be an explanation, but that would not exclude the possibility of the signal being from extraterrestrials. The significantly more sensitive Very Large Array did not detect the signal, and the probability that a signal not detected by the Very Large Array could be detected by the Big Ear due to interstellar twinkling is low. Other hypotheses include a rotating lighthouse-like source, a signal sweeping in frequency, or just a one-time event.

Ehman has said: "We should have seen it again when we looked for it 50 times. Something suggests it was an Earth-sourced signal that simply got reflected off a piece of space debris." He later took back his some of his doubt, after further research showed that explanation to be very unlikely, given that any space debris the signal would have bounced off of would have had to meet some unrealistic requirements. Also, other problems arise because the 1420 MHz signal is within a a bandwidth reserved for astronomical purposes, in which radios on Earth are banned from using. In a 1997 paper, Ehman suggest that not draw "vast conclusions from half-vast data"— and acknowledged the possibility that the signal may have been military or from people on Earth.

METI president Douglas Vakoch told "Die Welt" that any SETI signal detections must be heard again for confirmation, and the fact that it has not been heard again making the Wow! signal have little credibility.

In 2017, Antonio Paris, a teacher from Florida, proposed that the hydrogen cloud surrounding two comets, 266P/Christensen and 335P/Gibbs, now known to have been in the same region of the sky, could have caused the Wow! signal. This idea was dismissed by astronomers, including members of the original Big Ear research team, as the comets he suggested were not in the exact right spot at the correct time. Also, comets do not emit strongly at the frequencies that the signal was heard, and there is no explanation for why a comet would be observed in one feed horn but not in the other.

Ehman and other astronomers have tried to hear the signal again and identify it. The signal was expected to occur three minutes apart in each of the telescope's feed horns, but that did not happen. Ehman searched for a second occurence of the signal using Big Ear in the months after the detection, but it was never heard again.
In 1987 and 1989, Robert H. Gray listened for the signal using the META array at Oak Ridge Observatory, but did not hear it.  In a July 1995 test of signal detection software to be used in its upcoming Project Argus, SETI League executive director H. Paul Shuch made several observations of the Wow! signal's place in the sky with a 12-meter radio telescope at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, also never hearing anything.

In 1995 and 1996, Gray again searched for the signal using the Very Large Array, which is significantly more sensitive than Big Ear.  Gray and Simon Ellingsen later searched for and second occurrence of the signal in 1999 using the 26-meter radio telescope at the University of Tasmania's Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory. Six 14-hour observations were made at positions in the general point in the sky, but nothing like the Wow! signal was ever heard. 

In 2012, on the 35th anniversary of the Wow! signal, Arecibo Observatory beamed a message at Hipparcos 34511, 33277, and 43587. The transmission consisted of approximately 10,000 Twitter messages that National Geographic has asked fans to send in with the hashtag "#ChasingUFOs" (a promotion for one of the channel's TV series). The sponsor also included a series of videos with messages from several celebrities.

To increase the chance that any extraterrestrials that would hear it would recognize the signal as an attempt to communicate from another intelligent life form, Arecibo scientists attached a header to each individual message, and sent the transmission at roughly 20 times the power of the most powerful commercial radio transmitter.

Indian classical dance

The Indian classical dances are the dance forms representing the exemplary standards within the traditional and long-established forms or styles of the Indian culture. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, there are six classical dance forms of India. However, the number of classical dances vary in accordance to various sources.




Bharatnatyam is a classical Indian dance form that originates from that originates in the temples of Tamil Nadu. The dance form is a reconstruction os Sadir, the art of temple dancers devadasis. Lord Shiva as Nataraja is considered the God of this dance form. Today, it is one of the most popular and widely performed dance form practiced by male and female dancers all over the world. The original name of Bharatnatyam was Sadir, Chinnamelan and Dasi Attam. A possible origin of the Bharatnatyam is that it comes after Bharata Muni, the author of Natya Shastra. Another popular etymology (explanation of the name) holds “Bhavan” means expression, “ragam” means melody and “Talam” means rhythm, finally, “Natyam” means dance, so the dance which has Bhavan, Ragam and Talam is called Bharatnatyam.

Bharatnatyam is a solo dance with two aspects Lasya, the graceful and feminine aspects associated with Goddess Parvati and Tandava , the masculine and rigorous aspects associated with Lord Shiva.
The Bharatnatyam training has been given its present shape by the Tanjore brothers. It begins with the practice of Adavus and then the students are taught the Margam from Pushpanjli, Kautvam, Alarippu, Jatiswaram, Sabdam, Varnam, Padams, Tilina. After many years of training, a student can perform an “arangetram”, the first solo performance by a student. Bharatnatyam compositions are based on Carnatic Music system of Ragams and talams. It features graceful and assertive movements that are performed imaginary lines and geometrical patterns

Kathak is a dance form that originates from Uttar Pradesh, North India. It is said that: “Katha kahe so kathak,” which means that ‘He who tells a story is a Kathak’. The Kathak or professional story-teller had a thorough knowledge of the epics and mythology, village legends and local beliefs. It is said that the kathak was so adept at this art that he often kept a whole village absorbed while he sat entertaining them. 
Kathak is characterised bt graceful movements, subtle expressions and sophisticated use of rhythm. Technical virtuosity and flamboyance is complimented by subtlety in the depiction of moods and emotions. Pure dance is the predominant feature of Kathak. In Kathak, the dancer addresses directly to the audience. The knees are not flexed outwards or forwards as in the other classical dance form of India. The feet, with ghungroos around the ankles, beat out a whole range of rhythmic sounds. Skill in rendering intricate beats is fundamental to the style. 
Although, Kathak was an established tradition as a medium of worship during the Vaishnava age, it started being performed in courts with the coming of the Mughals. The dancer moved from thr temple courtyards to the palace durbar and this brought changes on the presentation as we know it today. Kathak saw a great period of glory in the 19th century during the reign of Wajid Ali Shah, the last nawab of Awadh. It was under his patronage that the Lucknow gharana was established. The two other important gharanas in Kathak are the Jaipur gharana and the Banaras gharana.

Twelve Years a Slave

Twelve Years a Slave is a book written by Solomon Northup. It was published in 1853. It is a true story. Northup was a free black man living in New York before the American Civil War. He was kidnapped and sold as a slave to Louisiana in 1841. "12 Years a Slave" was made into a movie in 2013.

In the 1840s, it was legal for people in Southern states to buy and sell enslaved people who had been born to enslaved mothers. But it was not legal to take a free person, pretend they were a slave, and sell that person. This is what happened to Solomon Northup.

After he was rescued in 1853, Solomon Northup traveled around the United States making speeches about his twelve years in the South. He did this because he wanted American voters to stop slavery. Later, he wrote down his speeches as a book. Editor David Wilson helped Northup write the book. Some people have asked whether Wilson wrote most of the book for Northup. But Wilson said that he heard Northup tell the story out loud many times without ever making a mistake or changing it and that he, Wilson, only helped Northup write it all down.

The book is true, but Northup and his publisher, Derby, were influenced by "Uncle Tom's Cabin" by Harriet Beecher Stowe, which was published one year earlier. The book is dedicated to Harriet Beecher Stowe. They marketed the book as "another "Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin"," meaning that, like Stowe's book, "A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin", it explained and supported "Uncle Tom's Cabin", proving that Stowe had not lied about how bad slavery was.

For many years, people forgot about "12 Years a Slave". Historian Sue Eakin found a copy in 1930 when she was twelve years old. When she grew up, she collected proof that Northup's story was true. For example, she talked to people who had known Edwin Epps, and they said Epps had told them the story was true.

The first chapters of the book talk about Northup's family and his life as a free man in New York. He is married and has children. His wife is a cook. He has had many jobs, as a farmer and carpenter, but he can also play the violin well.

While his wife is away on a cooking job, Northup meets men who say they want him to travel with them as a musician. He agrees. He makes sure he has papers proving he is a free man before traveling with them to Washington D.C. But when they are in the city, the men drug him and steal the papers. He wakes up in a cell because they have sold him as a slave.

Northup is taken south on a boat. Some of the other captives have been slaves all their lives, but others are kidnapped free men like Northup. Some of them plan to take over the boat and escape, but then they get sick and cannot. Northup, who can read and write, writes a note to a white friend in New York saying what has happened to him. One of the sailors promises to mail it for him.

In the rest of the book, Northup talks about living as a slave, about the people he meets, about the work he does, and about what he does to try to get home. The slavers give Northup the fake name "Platt." Northup says that the first man who bought him, named Ford, was not very bad. But the second man who bought him, named Tibeats, was cruel. The third man, named Epps, was even worse. He would hit and whip slaves no matter what they did. He would wake them up and make them dance at night. The next day, Epps would beat them if they did not work as hard as if they had had a full night's sleep. Epps would force the slaves to beat and whip each other while he watched. Northup talks about coming back to his cabin to find his cabinmate, Abram, covered in blood because Epps had stabbed him with a knife. Northup talks about Patsey, a slave woman, whom Epps forces to have sex with him. Northup talks about how Epps' wife hates Patsey even though it was not her fault. One time, Patsey has gone to a friend to get a bar of soap. Epps forces Northup to whip Patsey.

The British government says there will be a "once-in-a-generation show" that have had the best art and technology in its displays and the best British ceremonial greatness.

Carly Ledbetter, writing for the "Huffington Post", says because the Platinum Jubilee was being planned, Elizabeth II did not plan to stop being the British monarch in favour of her son Charles III when she became 95 years old in 2021.

The Queen's traditional birthday parade, also known as Trooping the Colour, will happen on 2 June 2022 instead of the usual second Saturday of June. Ovens by lighting beacons will happen on 2 June in the United Kingdom, the crown dependencies and the oversea territories.

Some of the biggest artists and entertainment stars will perform there. The BBC will make and show the concert. As with the Diamond Jubilee, they will work with the European Broadcasting Union. Members of the public will be invited to apply to come to the event.

On the last day of the longer bank holiday, it is hoped people will have a 'Big Jubilee Lunch' and communities will celebrate their connections and know each other a little better there. Street arts, theatre, music, circus, carnival, buffets and costume celebrating the Queen's reign will happen in a pageant, where there will be more than 5,000 people from the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, and Buckingham Palace in the background.

A Platinum Jubilee medal will be made for the Jubilee. People who work in public service, including people who represent the Armed Forces, the emergency services and the prison services, will get them.

99 Bottles of Beer

"99 Bottles of Beer" is a backwards counting song in both the United States and Canada.

The words to the song are:

Alternative lines:

If one of those bottles should happen to fall, (there'd be )98 bottles of beer on the wall...

Or:

If one of those bottles should accidentally fall, (there'd be )98 bottles of beer on the wall...

We repeat the line many times, with one less bottle each time. When there are no bottles left, a different line is used. Some lines that can be used for when there are no bottles are:

No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.

Go to the store and buy some more 99 bottles of beer on the wall...

Or:

No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.

We've taken them down and passed them around; now we're drunk and passed out!
Other alternate lines read:

If that one bottle should happen to fall, what a waste of alcohol!
Or:

No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer( on the wall).

There's nothing else to fall, because there's no more bottles of beer on the wall.
Sometimes, the song does not stop when there are 1 or no bottles of beer left. In this case, the song keeps going with -1, -2, -3, and so on bottles of beer.
American comedian Andy Kaufman had a comedy bit where he would sing all 100 verses. This was considered funny because the song is not usually completed due to its length.

Atticus, a band from Knoxville, Tennessee, recorded a version of the song in front of people. It took 13 and a half minutes. It was recorded at a Glasgow, Scotland bar called The Cathouse. It was included in the 2001 album "Figment". Rich Stewart, also known as Homebrew Stew, called it the number one drinking song out of 86 in an article for "Modern Drunkard Magazine".

Donald Byrd has dozens of versions of the song. These versions are inspired by math topics. The songs written by himself and others, and some of them have been published. Byrd says that the collection is fun and a good way to teach about infinity. Among his versions are:Infinite bottles of beer on the wall,

infinite bottles of beer;

If one of those bottles should happen to fall, 

infinite bottles of beer on the wall.Infinite bottles of beer on the wall, 

infinite bottles of beer; 

If finite bottles should happen to fall,

However, Osugi decides to sort for the survival of his unit. By late September, the seaplane carrier Wakamiya loaded up the biplanes on the deck, became the world's first aircraft carrier and headed for Qingdao. And finally, it's time for the first operation to destroyed the fortress. The Mo-type seaplane on which Osugi and Kunii were piloting was not in time for the bomb, and while bricks and five-inch nails, it started with the enthusiastic farewell of the crew. 

While fitting in the air pocket and connecting the broken wire of Kunii on the wings, they managed to drop bricks and five-inch nails onto the German trenches from above to scout the fortress. However, the enemy plane flies there and battled them. In contrast to the Taube, who is armed with a , the Mo-style plane has only a for self-defense, and Taube, who provokes in , is forced to disperse. After that, the squadron set up a base on near the bay to prevent the danger of entering the base. Osugi responds to the request of the islanders, such as Yang Hakurei, the girl dancer Maki saved her from the predicament at a . However, a bottled letter reveals that the islanders has a spy among them. 

And on the night of the festival, Hakurei's older brother, Zhao Hidetoshi, set fire to the and planned to sink the Wakamiya. While the fire armada junk approaches the seaplane carrier, Shoji jumps into the sea and is killed after being caught in a junk explosion while trying to change the bow of the boat, saving his team in the process. Hidetoshi was also shot dead by Ninomiya after calming he was a spy for the Germans. The headquarters demanded that Hakurei be punished by the island's troops, but Osugi and his fellow pilots refused to hand over her to the continent under Article 123 of the Fictitious Navy Criminal Code and they might get the information from her about the defense plan. Osugi devised a plan to drop a bomb hung on Unit 1 while Unit 2 on which the machine gunner was riding to distracted the Taube plane. 

He sort out the ideas and executes the operation, but the bomb fails without hitting a single hit. Moreover, Unit 2, piloting by Ninomiya and Maki, managed to kill the Taube's machine gunner, but crashed after being hit by the engine. Ninomiya and Maki manged to escape to a general store, but the two who had the prize money are pushed out by German soldiers by the shop owner and become .

Hakurei, who appears in front of the two in the dungeon, sentenced them to death. However, on the way to the execution site, Hakurei escapes with them. On the other hand, one month has passed since the start of the capture of Qingdao had planned out, and as the German Far East Unit approached to the bay, there were many opinions that the fleet should also start a total attack without relying on aircraft. Admiral Kato realizes that the plane was premature and decides to demote the Wakamiya to a carrier and make a total attack. Meanwhile, only Maki returned to the Wakamiya. Osugi devise a strategy to take off the remaining one plane without a bomb, replenish fuel and explosives after landing on the shore, and then bomb the ammunition depot at Bismarck Fortress. Osugi commands the task team and lands, deceiving the eyes of the German soldiers and heading for the supply depot. However, at that time, the Wakamiya was sunk by a .The seaplane floating on the sea took off for the ammunition depot bombing with the encouragement of the drifting Wakamiya crew.

Gluconeogenesis

Gluconeogenesis (GNG) is a chemical process in living bodies. In gluconeogenesis, the body turns fats and proteins (glucogenic amino acids) into sugars called glucose. In most animals with spines, gluconeogenesis happens in the liver, but some animals have gluconeogenesis in the kidneys. gluconeogenesis usually happens when the organism has not eaten many starches or sugars or eaten nothing at all for a long time. Not eating and not eating starch can cause ketosis, which is when some cells cannot use ketones for fuel.

In humans, the main gluconeogenic compounds are lactate, glycerol (a part of the triglyceride molecule), alanine and glutamine. They are involved in over 90% of the overall process.

Lactate comes back to the liver where it is converted into pyruvate by the Cori cycle using the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate, the first designated substrate of the gluconeogenic pathway, can then be used to make glucose.

Fat is mostly broken down, but if there is no fat to break down, or the body cannot access the fat stores, then proteins found in the muscle can break down, resulting in muscle loss.

Low-carbohydrate diet

A Low-carbohydrate diet is a type of diet that focuses on lowering the amount of carbohydrates eaten. There are many variations of this diet which all focus on lowering carbohydrates and might have different advantages and disadvantages.

The National Lipid Association and Lifestyle Task force define low-carbohydrate diets as those containing less than 25% of calories from carbohydrates. They define very low carbohydrate diets as those containing less than 10% carbohydrates. A 2016 review of low-carbohydrate diets referred to diets with 50 grams of carbohydrate per day (less than 10% of total calories) as "very low" and diets with 40% of calories from carbohydrates as "mild" low-carbohydrate diets.

There is evidence that the quality is also important too, and that high-fiber slow-digesting foods are healthful while ultra-processed and sugary foods are less so. People choosing diet for health conditions should have the diet focused on their own needs.

Most vegetables are low- or moderate-carbohydrate foods. Some vegetables, such as potatoes, carrots, maize (corn) and rice are high in starch. Most low-carbohydrate diet plans encourage to eat vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, kale, lettuce, cucumbers, cauliflower, peppers and most green-leafy vegetables.

In 1797, John Rollo reported on the results of treating two diabetic Army officers with a low-carbohydrate diet and medications. A very low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet was the standard treatment for diabetes throughout the nineteenth century.

In 1863, William Banting, a formerly obese English undertaker and coffin maker, published "Letter on Corpulence Addressed to the Public". He described a diet for weight control giving up bread, butter, milk, sugar, beer, and potatoes. His booklet was widely read, so much so that some people used the term "Banting" for the activity now called "dieting."

In the early 1900s Frederick Madison Allen made a highly restrictive short term diet which was described by Walter R. Steiner at the 1916 annual convention of the Connecticut State Medical Society as "The Starvation Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus". This diet was often administered in a hospital in order to better ensure following and safety.

COVID-19 pandemic in Iowa

The COVID-19 pandemic first hit the American Midwest state of Iowa in March 2020. The first known cases were three people who had traveled on a cruise in Egypt. They came home to Johnson County on March 3. Cases were first found at meat packing plants and care facilities. By late October, community spread was a concern in the state.

On March 9, 2020, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds signed a Proclamation of Disaster Emergency.

On April 25, the first testing site was launched in Des Moines under the new initiative "TestIowa.com".

During a May 6, 2020 meeting with Reynolds, then-President Donald Trump answered to the increased coronavirus testing rate.

Iowa's largest industry is manufacturing. Most manufacturing relates to food. That means the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the meat packing industry is highly disruptive in Iowa.

Iowa State University, the University of Iowa and the University of Northern Iowa expected losses to go past $76 million, $89 million and $28 million, respectively.

As of June 1, 2021, COVID-19 was responsible for more than 6,000 deaths in Iowa.

SLAPP Suits

"SLAPP Suits" is a part of the HBO show "Last Week Tonight with John Oliver." It is focused on strategic lawsuits against public participation, known as SLAPP suits–lawsuits made to scare people out of saying anything bad about someone else. It was first played on November 10, 2019, as part of the twenty-ninth episode of the series's sixth season. During the twenty six-minute video, comedian John Oliver talked about the result of a lawsuit against him from mining businessman Robert E. "Bob" Murray. He talked about the harmful effects of lawsuits like that. Oliver then ended the clip with a song entitled "Eat Shit, Bob!" in honor of winning his lawsuit.

On June 18, 2017, John Oliver played a video on his show, called "Coal". Itt was about the coal mining industry. Oliver began the piece by showing Donald Trump's fondness for the coal industry. He played videos of him when he was running for president in 2016 in a coal miner's hat and talking to a crowd that had miners in it. In the speech, he told the miners to prepare to work their "asses off" when he became President. Oliver then introduced Bob Murray, who is the head of Murray Energy.

Oliver explained that he and his team talked to Murray Energy about this segment before showing it. He said that he received a letter from Murray Energy telling him that he should cease and desist from–or stop–"any efforts to [...] injure Mr. Murray". Oliver also said that Murray has sued people before. Oliver ignored this letter. He called Murray a "geriatric Dr. Evil" who was "on the same side as black lung". Oliver also talked about other errors in the way Murray's miners were told to do their jobs. Oliver particularly talked about the Crandall Canyon Mine collapse that killed 9 people. Bob Murray argued that it was the fault of an earthquake. However, the federal government said that it was the fault of the dangerous way miners were told to do their jobs. The government told Murray Energy that they had to pay . This is the highest amount possible the federal government can make someone pay for doing a dangerous thing like this. Oliver then talked about Murray's program for coal miners to earn more money. The workers did not like the program. They said that it might encourage them to do dangerous things for more money. The company told the workers that they could return their money if they felt they were being encouraged to do risky things. Two miners gave back the money, writing the words "KISS MY ASS BOB" and "Eat Shit Bob" on their checks. Oliver also talked about Murray also sharing a story that he received the idea to start a coal mining business from a talking squirrel. Drawing on the two stories, Oliver ended the episode by introducing a squirrel mascot known as "Mr. Nutterbutter" (played by Noel MacNeal). Mr. Nutterbutter taunted Bob Murray by holding up an big check–a piece of paper making a promise to pay money–for "three acorns and eighteen cents". The money was addressed to "Eat Shit, Bob!"

On June 22, 2017, some companies owned by Bob Murray said that they had filed a lawsuit. The lawsuit was against John Oliver, HBO, and others close to Oliver. Bob Murray said that Oliver had defamed them–said untrue and bad things about Murray and his company. The plaintiffs said that they didn't like the way Oliver talked about the Crandall Canyon Mine collapse. They repeated what they had said before about the mine collapse–that it was because of an earthquake and that Oliver was lying. They also said that because so many people watch Oliver's show, that he was unfairly hurting Murray. Murray wanted money from Oliver, as well as a gag order–a court telling someone not to say something–stopping people from watching the segment.

Someone who talks for HBO said that HBO was happy with the show. They that they did not believe that "anything in the show this week violated Mr. Murray’s or Murray Energy’s rights".

On February 24, 2018, the case was thrown out. This was because the judge agreed with HBO's argument that Murray hadn't shown that anything was wrong with what Oliver did. Bob Murray asked another court to reconsider the case. Before they could, all the justices on that court were fired. The case was dropped soon after. Oliver later said that this was a relief to him. This was because he had made a joke on his show a few years before. He said that the head Justice on the court, Allen Loughry, referred to his penis as "The Gavel".

The ACLU–an activist group of lawyers–wrote a letter to the court for Oliver. People liked the letter because it was funny and sarcastic. This is not common in that type of letter. The paper had lines such as "You Can’t Sue People for Being Mean to You, Bob" and "A Brief History of Plaintiffs’ Attempts to Chill Speech by Abusing the Legal System." The letter said that Oliver's segment did not say anything that was bad for Murray. They said some of the statements were jokes, and the rest were true. The letter said that Murray was using the court as a way to force people not to say things. The argument was helped by a list of Murray's other lawsuits. The ACLU listed lawsuits thrown out by the courts against HuffPost, a newspaper in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, Bloomberg News, and other papers and activists.

Murray didn't like the way people were talking about the letter. Murray Energy wrote their own letter to the court. It said that the court shouldn't read the ACLU letter. They said this was because ACLU didn't make it clear that they made money because of Oliver's show. Murray didn't like the way the ACLU worded their letter. They wrote that the biased tone by itself should make the court throw away the other letter. 5 days after the 2016 United States presidential election, Oliver's show made a video called "President-Elect Trump". Oliver told to donate to activists they saw as left-leaning. These clauses included Planned Parenthood, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, The Trevor Project, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and the International Refugee Assistance Project. Murray Energy said that this encouragement caused an "immediate surge of millions of dollars in donations to the ACLU". Because of this, said Murray Energy, the court should throw away the ACLU's letter. "Reuters" argued that Murray Energy did not prove that what they said was true. They said this because Murray provided links to three articles to prove what they said. None of the articles backed up what Murray said. The articles did agree that the activists got more money. However, they said that it was because of the election, and not because of Oliver's show.

On November 10, 2019, John Oliver put out a video on his show, called "SLAPP Suits". Oliver began by recapping the legal fight so far. Oliver said that even though he won the lawsuit, his tripled his monthly fee and that his show paid to the show's lawyers. Oliver then argued that Bob Murray never intended to win the case. Instead, Oliver said that Murray wanted to scare HBO and him into silence. This led Oliver into the main point of the segment—SLAPP suits, which are lawsuits designed to scare people into not saying bad things about someone else, even if they are true. Oliver pointed out that Murray has filed at least nine lawsuits against news companies and journalists who have said bad things about him, including the "Huffington Post" and "The New York Times". Oliver argued that Murray has sued those who aren't lucky enough to have the support of a large company like HBO and their own insurance. He then suggested that because those people might be scared of Murray, they won't say anything bad about him. Oliver argued that this led to almost nobody in the press writing about two sexual harassment cases against Murray. One of these cases involved Murray asking a woman employee to get on her hands and knees and find a kidney stone that Murray had passed and lost.

Oliver said that the segment was checked over by HBO's lawyers (who he joked were "getting very tired of this"). However, he also said that the episode would likely lead to another lawsuit from Murray. Oliver said that he would stand behind his works if it were to happen. When Judge Jeffery D. Cramer threw out Oliver's case, he noted that people are allowed to use "loose, figurative language". Oliver brought this up as his reason to create a musical number to end the episode.

Oliver took the name of "Eat Shit, Bob" from the money the miner returned. He then acted in a five-minute musical number, initially set in his studio. There, he began singing slowly that "even though he'll threaten legal Armageddon, we have just one tiny thing to say..." Then, P;over put up his middle finger and exclaimed "Bob Murray can go fuck himself today!" He then introduced the "Suck My Balls, Bob" dancers. The dancers to Times Square as they recounted fake stories of Murray doing crazy and terrible things. They joked that he caused the 1994 Cobo Arena attack on Nancy Kerrigan, shot puppies into outer space, supplied drugs to Bill Cosby, murdered Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and started World War I, and was the Zodiac Killer. Oliver based parts of the song on his legal defense. He sang that "we made up these anecdotes, they're silly and insane". He also said in the beginning of the piece that "If we discuss Bob Murray in a way no reasonable person could construe as factual, we can say whatever the fuck we like!" Mr. Nutterbutter came back with a barbershop quartet in squirrel costumes. They joked that Bob Murray practiced bestiality with squirrels. Brian d'Arcy James also made an appearance as HBO's legal counsel. At first, he told everyone to stop singing and dancing. Then, James went into his own segment. There, he recounted Bob Murray forcing tourists at the New York City M&M's Store to watch as he "crammed them (M&M's) up his anal hole." The number was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics.

An opinion from the "Charleston Gazette-Mail" said that there was "a lesson in John Oliver roasting Bob Murray". The lesson was that we should think about why states like West Virginia have relaxed anti-SLAPP laws.

The musical number was well-liked. "The A.V. Club" said that the episode was a demonstration in "why rich assholes really shouldn’t sue John Oliver". They also said that the musical number was "glorious" and "over-the-top". "Slate" said that just because Oliver gave an "impassioned speech standing up for all the small outlets and independent activists bullied into silence by SLAPP lawsuits," that does not mean John Oliver "has matured even a little bit".

"The Mary Sue" commented that Bob Murray's SLAPP suits create a "culture of fear in which Murray ends up able to succeed in his goal of stifling any criticism of him and his industrial operations". However, they also say that Murray "may have picked too big a fish" in John Oliver, adding that "Of course, this is John Oliver we’re talking about and 'culture of fear' is basically his Bat-Signal."

Name and Title Authority File of Catalonia

The Name and Title Authority File of Catalonia (CANTIC) is an authority union catalogue within the Union Catalogue of Universities of Catalonia (CCUC), that it is led by the library of Catalonia known locally as Biblioteca de Catalunya. The goals are to bring order to the bibliographic catalogues, to improve communication among catalogues and finally, to make getting information research brought to them faster. CANTIC treats those who control name and title authorities related with Catalan culture in a higher regards. These authorities receive a complete authority work and are provided, eventually, access to the Catalonia Encyclopedia or known locally as Enciclopèdia Catalana.

CANTIC has the aim to be the catalogue of authority records created cooperatively by Catalan libraries. These records have to be generated from the authority control of name, name-title and title access points of Catalan bibliographic records. This guarantees the standardization and uniqueness of access points of catalogues, which makes it easier the exchange and a more efficient communication of bibliographic records and, in the end, enables users to carry out assisted, precise and exhaustive searches. 
CANTIC is a national service that allows to standardize and give consistency to the catalogues of the Catalan library system; it is the tool that facilitates the creation of the future Unique Catalogue of Catalonia (CUC), devised in the frame of the Agreement of the Catalan Government of 20 July 2004, for the improvement and modernization of Catalan Library System.

At a meeting held on 16 September 2002, the Advisory Commission of Cataloguing, the advisory body of the Biblioteca de Catalunya in terms of cataloguing, talked about the need of creating a list of authorities in Catalonia. It was decided to establish a subcommittee to study the technical feasibility of the project and to prepare the requirements and functionality of the list of name and title authorities, taking into account the real needs of the Catalan Library System. The Subcommittee met for the first time on 27 March 2003 and finished the job in October 2003. In the report prepared by them are presented:
The Name and Title Authority File of Catalonia was created following the Catalan Library System Act, Llei 4/1993 “La Biblioteca de Catalunya supervisa, valida i unifica en un sol llistat el catàleg d’autoritats"

The participants are the Biblioteca de Catalunya, the Casa Àsia, the Centre de Lectura (Reus), the Consorci de Bibliothèques de les Universitats de Catalunya, the Il•lustre Col•legi d'Advocats de Barcelona, the Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona, the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, the Universitat de Barcelona, the Universitat de Girona, the Universitat de Lleida, the Universitat de Vic, the Universitat Jaume I, the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, the Universitat Pompeu Fabra and the Universitat Rovira i Virgili.

The authority records of CANTIC are created following the international cataloguing principles and the specifications of the Biblioteca de Catalunya, which were approved by the CCUC. Records are encoded with MARC 21. There is also a CANTIC guide with the procedure for elaborating the authority records by the entities involved. The Bibliographic Standardization Service is responsible for providing training and support to all participants while ensuring the quality of authority records. The constant introduction of new authority records turns CANTIC into a living organism in a permanent process of transformation and change. Updating the content of the database is done monthly and is available on the website of the Biblioteca de Catalunya.

Maiba

A Maiba or an Amaiba (literally, "priest") is a male religious leader authorised to perform the sacred rites and rituals of Sanamahism (Meitei religion), especially as a mediatory agent between human beings and one or more deities. They have the authority or power to administer religious rites as well as sacrifices to gods. Their office or institution is called Maiba Loishang (Maiba Loisang), later renamed as Pandit Loisang, during Aryanisation of Meitei culture. They also served as healers, doctors, magicians, medicine men, physicians and shamans.
They play important roles in the ancestor worship (apokpa khurumjaba) ceremony.
Chief priest or chief among the maibas is called Maichou, a term formed with the amalgamation of two words ("maiba"- priest, "achouba"- big, chief, great).
Since their position is not hereditary, they acquire their positions through talent and skills. The female counterpart of a Maiba is a Maibi.

Colombian peso

The peso is divided into 100 centavos. However, because the value of Colombia’s currency is extremely low. Although 1 centavo and 5 centavo coins still exist, the lowest denomination of the Colombian peso that is commonly used is the 50 pesos coin.

The central bank of Colombia – Banco de la República – is the entity tasked with issuing Colombian currency and with monitoring and controlling the foreign exchange rate for the peso.



The peso was first produced in 1810, when it replaced the Spanish real. At that time, the peso was pegged to the real at an exchange rate of 8 reals to 1 peso. During the rest of the 19th century, Colombian currency included gold and silver coins in varying denominations, up to a 10 peso gold coin. Modern Colombian coins are minted, like those of other currencies, using primarily copper and nickel alloys.

In the early 20th century, the Colombian peso was pegged to the British pound sterling. Still, the government transferred the peg to the US dollar in 1931 at an exchange rate of 1.05 pesos to 1 US dollar, when Britain abandoned the gold standard. The peg to the US dollar remained until 1949, when continuing inflation in Colombia forced the central bank to abandon the US dollar peg.

Colombia ceased minting all centavos coins – those with a value of less than 1 peso – in 1984. In the most recently minted coin series in Colombia – the 2012 series – the lowest denomination coin minted and in circulation is the 50 pesos coin. Coins are also minted in denominations of 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 pesos.

Colombian banknotes are printed in denominations of 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, and 100,000 pesos. The 50,000 peso banknote is distinguished by the fact that, unlike most banknotes of any currency, its image is printed vertically instead of horizontally.

Despite its inflation problems, Colombia’s economy continues to thrive and grow remarkably, with the country’s GDP growth rate reaching as high as nearly 7% in recent years.

Over the past century, the Colombian economy’s undergone a dramatic transition, changing from an almost entire agrarian economy to an economy where the services sector accounts for more than half of the country’s GDP.

Key Colombian exports include oil, coal, cut flowers, bananas, textiles, and emeralds. The country’s mines produce 80%-90% of the world’s total supply of emeralds. Colombia conducts substantial import-export trade worldwide. Its principal trading partners include both China and the United States.

However, despite its overall strong economic performance, Colombia faces consistently high poverty and unemployment rates. Just over 25% of the country’s population lives below the poverty line, with unemployment rates fluctuating between 9% and 12% in recent years.

Shortly after winning a boxing match against Ivan Drago, Rocky and his family return to the United States. When the family returns home, it is revealed that Paulie had signed a power of attorney over to Rocky's accountant, who sabotaged the family's entire fortune of real estate deals gone sour. In addition, the accountant did not pay Rocky's tax returns within the past known years, and the mortgage on the family's mansion is in debt worth $400,000. When Rocky sees a doctor, it is revealed that he has suffered some brain damage, which forces his to regret his decision to continue boxing and retire.

After selling the mansion and auctioning off some of the belongings, the family has paid off the mortgage debt and moves back to their former site in southern Philadelphia. One day, Rocky meets someone named Tommy Gunn, and agrees to train him. Rocky becomes so fixated on training Tommy that he ends up neglecting his family, especially for his son Robert, who is being harassed in school. Around the holidays, promoter George Washington Duke visits the Balboa residence, which foreshadows Tommy turning his back on Rocky. Rocky reconnects with his family, while Tommy wins the boxing championship against Union Cane. The media condemns Tommy for leaving Rocky, a concept of which Tommy brushes away. Duke recommends Tommy to have a street fight with Rocky, which proves to be the only way of facing a true contender.

Association Trio

Association Trio (, "asotsirebuli trio"; ; ) is a tripartite format for enhanced cooperation, coordination and dialogue between the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, the three EU Associate Partners, and the European Union on issues of common interest related to the European integration of states, including cooperation in the framework of Eastern Partnership for the sake of joining the European Union.

The participants of the format express a clear position of the aspiration of the three European states of the "Associated Trio" for membership in the European Union and reaffirm their commitment to further progress in implementing the Association Agreements with the EU, which, however, is not the ultimate goal of their relations with the EU. In this context, they recall that under Article 49 TEU, European countries, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine have a European perspective and can apply for membership of the European Union, provided that all the necessary criteria for EU membership are met.

Coordinating their actions, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine seek to expand the possibilities of association agreements, promote sectoral convergence with the EU (integration into the Digital Single Market, energy and customs union, ENTSO-E, and, of course, with the Schengen Area; transport cooperation, green course, justice and home affairs, strategic communications, health, security and defense) and gradual integration into the European Single Market.

Only 1 nation in the 193 members has not recognized Armenia, Pakistan firmly states that Armenia should be a part of the Islamic country of Azerbaijan. Other then Pakistan, 192 UN states have agreed that Armenia is its own Republic.

Pakistan has played huge parts in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which is a dispute between Azerbaijan, and Armenia over certain territories.

Even though Pakistan does not recognize Armenia, Armenia is not in threat to being invaded by Azerbaijan as it has support from other nations in the UN.

After Armenia was declared independent in 1991, it joined the UN a year later. Many countries agreed to accept Armenia as independent of any other country, which at first all countries agreed until 2015, when the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict was getting larger.

Pakistan declared it would support Azerbaijan in the conflict and declared "recognizing Armenia's independence is contingent on the latter leaving Karabakh." They soon withdrew recognition of Armenia completely stating Armenia rightfully belonged to Azerbaijan. This led to the de facto, Republic of Artsakh allying itself with Armenia, while Turkey and Pakistan aided the Azerbaijani's.

The only African country in the UN Armenia has relations to is Egypt, but every country in Africa recognizes Armenia, though not all recognize the Armenian genocide.

The only country in Oceania that has relations with Armenia is Australia, but all countries in Oceania recognize Armenia, though not all officially recognize the Armenian genocide.

The double thank-you of capitalism

The double thank-you of capitalism is noticing that, when a seller and a customer give money to one another for goods, each thanks the other, showing that the transaction is not only optional, but good for everyone who was involved. This can be shown as different to the thought of a "fixed slice pie" that takes place in many other situations, with one side taking and the other giving, a thank-you would only pass only one way. The double thank-you is used in economic discussions to show an example of the first benefit of a free market, that where all actions are optional, any transactions must benefit both sides, and this helps everyone in the general community.

Robert Smalls

Robert Smalls(April 5, 1839 – February 23, 1915) was a Temu Biggie Smalls, American politician, publisher, businessman, and Maritime pilot. Born into slavery in Beaufort, South Carolina. He freed himself, his friends, and their families during the American Civil War. He did this by commandeering a Confederate transport ship, CSS "Planter", in Charleston harbor, on May 13, 1862. He then sailed it from Confederate-controlled waters of the harbor to the U.S. blockade that surrounded it. He then piloted the ship to the Union-controlled enclave in Beaufort–Port Royal–Hilton Head area, where it became a Union warship. His example and persuasion helped convince President Abraham Lincoln to allow African-American soldiers into the Union Army.

Robert Smalls was born in 1839 to Lydia Polite, a slave owned by Henry McKee. She gave birth to him in a cabin behind McKee's house, at 511 Prince Street in Beaufort, South Carolina. He grew up in the city under the influence of the Lowcountry Gullah culture of his mother. His mother lived as a servant in the house, but she grew up in the fields. Robert was liked more than other slaves, so his mother worried that he might grow up not understanding the troubles of field slaves. She asked for him to be made to work in the fields and to see whipping.



Racially-motivated violence

Racially-motivated violence (or ethnic violence) is a form of violence which is caused by the dislike of people from one ethnic group towards people of another ethnic group. Xenophobia often also plays a role. If the question is about grouping many similar events, people also talk about ethnic conflict. It is important to make a difference between ethnic violence, which is violence "motivated" by an ethnic division, from violence that just happens to break out between groups of different ethnicity motivated by other factors (political or ideological).

Bisho massacre

The Bisho massacre occurred on 7 September 1992 in Bisho. Bisho was in the independent homeland of Ciskei. Ciskei is now part of the Eastern Cape in South Africa. During a protest march, members of the Ciskei Defence Force shot twenty-eight African National Congress supporters and one soldier when they attempted to enter Bisho (now renamed to Bhisho). The ANC supporter wanted that Ciskei was again made part of South Africa. The massacre happened during the final years of apartheid.

Bhisho (previously spelled "Bisho") was the capital of the Ciskei. Ciskei was a nominally independent homeland (bantustan) for the Xhosa people in South Africa. The government of Ciskei was formed in 1961 under the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951 after the South African government declared it a separate administrative territory. In 1972, the status was changed to self-governing territory. At the same time, there were stronger efforts to forcibly remove Xhosa-speakers to Ciskei. On 4 December 1982, Ciskei became an independent republic, recognised only by the South African government and other 'independent' homeland states in South Africa. The system of racially segregated homelands had been a core of apartheid, but between 1990 and 1994, negotiations were taking place between the government of South Africa and the African National Congress (ANC) to end the apartheid system.

The negotiations would likely lead to multi-racial democratic elections. For this reason, the ANC wanted to organise and mobilise its supporters in the Ciskei, because it lay in the Eastern Cape area. The Eastern Cape area had been a stronghold for ANC supporters. Its military leader Brigadier Oupa Gqozo resisted this and prevented the ANC from organising. In 1991, Gqozo formed the African Democratic Movement to counter the ANC in Ciskei. In December of the same year, he was part of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa) negotiations. Codesa was a forum made up of government (National Party) and non-government interest groups to negotiate a new constitution and the transition to democracy in South Africa. In March 1992, Gqozo accused the ANC of planning to overthrow him and in August he stopped ANC marchers from entering Ciskei from King William's Town, a town in South Africa, which is close enough to Ciskei.

On 3 September, the ANC sent a memorandum to President F. W. de Klerk: it demanded that he replace Gqozo with a temporary administration which would permit free democratic activity in Ciskei. De Klerk refused, on the grounds that the Ciskei did not fall under South Africa's jurisdiction. At the time, negotiations had broken down, with the ANC withdrawing following the Boipatong massacre and accusing De Klerk's government of fostering the violence.

As a result, the ANC began a campaign of "mass action", organising a protest march to occupy Bisho and force Gqozo's resignation. Gqozo sought a court ruling to prevent the march, and the magistrate ruled that it could take place at the homeland's independence stadium, outside Bisho, but could not enter the capital. The ANC refused to recognise the jurisdiction of the Ciskei court.

On 7 September, about 80,000 protesters gathered outside Bisho, signalling the wide opposition to Gqozo's rule. The meeting was led by senior ANC leaders including South African Communist Party Secretary General Chris Hani, Cyril Ramaphosa, Steve Tshwete and Ronnie Kasrils.
A razor wire was erected on the border between South Africa and Ciskei to prevent the marchers from entering Bisho. When Kasrils led a group trying to break through the Ciskei Defence Force lines to enter Bisho, Ciskei Defence Force soldiers opened fire on the marchers with automatic weapons, killing 28 marchers and one soldier, and injuring over 200. More than 425 rounds were fired, the first fusillade lasting one and a half minutes, and the second lasting a minute.

Various inquiries agreed that the order to fire came from Colonel Vakele Archibald Mkosana, who incorrectly told his commanders by radio that his troops were under fire, and was given permission to return fire. Rifleman Mzamile Thomas Gonya was also found to have opened fire with a grenade launcher, killing one marcher.

The Goldstone Commission had the task of investigating the massacre, and Justice Richard Goldstone condemned Gqozo for preventing political activity in Ciskei as well as for the lethal brutality of the Ciskei Defence Force troops. It dismissed his claim that the demonstrators had fired first. A Ciskei soldier who died during the shooting had been shot by a fellow soldier, in error. It recommended strong action against Gqozo and those responsible. It also condemned Ronnie Kasrils for leading marchers breaking through the razor wire and provoking the forces into opening fire.

On 8 September 1992, a day after the massacre, the ANC released a statement demanding that Oupa Gqozo be removed as the leader of Ciskei, Section 43 of the Ciskei National Security Act which prevented political activity in Ciskei be revoked and South African Military Intelligence officials be removed from Ciskei.
In the end, the massacre led to new negotiations between the ANC and the government. Nelson Mandela met De Klerk on 26 September and signed a Record of Understanding. This Record created an independent body to oversee police operations. 

Gqozo remained in power in Ciskei but resigned shortly before the elections of 27 April 1994.

A granite monument was erected on the site of the massacre, outside Independence Stadium, off Maitland Road between Bhisho and King William's Town. It was unveiled by Archbishop Desmond Tutu in 1997. The victims were buried in Ginsberg township outside King William's Town.
Each year during the month of September, the Bisho Massacre Memorial Lecture is held to commemorate the massacre and different leaders from around South Africa take part in it.

Only two applications for amnesty for the massacre were received by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, from Colonel Mkosana, who gave the order to open fire, and Rifleman Gonya, who fired a grenade launcher. Gqozo agreed to testify before the TRC, but failed to appear after being admitted to a psychiatric hospital suffering from depression.

In 2000, both Mkosana and Gonya were denied amnesty on the grounds that their actions were reckless and disproportionate and not associated with a political motive.

Following their failure to receive amnesty, Mkosana and Gonya were charged with one count of murder and Mkosana with 28 counts of culpable homicide. They were found not guilty on all charges on the grounds of self-defence.

Speaking at a Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearing on the massacre,Col Silence Pita, revealed that Gqozo had received a message which said that the Mkhonto Wesizwe was planning coup and would take us where we didn't want to be " but the source of the information had not been made clear in the report. Pita said security arrangements for an African National Congress march on September 7, 1992 were left to the Ciskei Defence Force.

Former Ciskei foreign affairs minister Mickey Webb testified that South Africa's intelligence services caused a confrontation between Ciskei government and the ANC. He claimed that South African Military Intelligence and Ciskei's own intelligence agency fed the Ciskei government with misinformation "which could only have ended up in confrontation between the authorities and the ANC".

Heidelberg Tavern massacre

The Heidelberg Tavern massacre occurred in Observatory, Cape Town on 30 December 1993. Three people associated with the Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA) entered the tavern and shot at the crowd. They killed four students and the owner of a restaurant which was close. The owner had gone outside to investigate, because he had heard gunshots. An unexploded bomb (with nails strapped to it) was found in the restaurant, close to the main entrance.

During the years of apartheid, Observatory was one of the few "de facto" "grey" suburbs where all races lived together. On the evening of 30 December 1993, three men entered a popular student venue on Station Road, called the Heidelberg Tavern and opened fire, killing four people and injuring five. The three APLA operatives - Humphrey Luyanda Gqomfa, Vuyisile Brian Madasi and Zola Prince Mabala - were convicted in November 1994 for what became known as the Heidelberg Massacre. On 16 July 1998, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission granted the three amnesty.

Medicine in the American Civil War

Medicine in the American Civil War was not good by today's standards. Doctors did not know about germs, so many soldiers caught infections. They did have anesthesia, so they were able to stop soldiers' pain. Most doctors in the United States had two years of schooling. Harvard Medical School did not have even one microscope.

One problem was that, like in World War I, people had just invented new weapons, like the Minié ball. Guns with rifled barrels did not miss as often as the muskets from the Revolutionary War and other earlier wars did. That meant doctors did not already know how to treat the injuries that these weapons could cause in the human body. Another problem was that the camps and battlefields were very dirty. A soldier in the American Civil war was twice as likely to die of disease as of a battle injury.

560,000 soldiers died of diseases during the American Civil War. Malaria was a problem in the American Civil War. Doctors gave patients quinine for malaria. Soldiers also died of dysentery, diarrhea, and typhoid.

Most doctors did not know about germs in the mid-1800s. They did not always wash their hands or tools between patients. They also thought that pus, if thick and creamy, was "laudable pus" and meant the patient was getting better. Really, pus means the patient has an infection.

About 200,000 people had injuries in the American Civil War.

Anesthesia was invented in 1846. Doctors in the American Civil War did have chloroform, ether, and other anesthetics, and they used them. 90 percent of patients who had a limb cut off had anesthesia first, usually chloroform. The doctors dripped chloroform onto a cloth and then put it over the patient's face.

Doctors invented two ways to do amputations, the circular method and the fish-mouth method. There were so many amputations in the American Civil War that doctors became very good at amputating. The Minié ball and other new weapons could destroy large pieces of bone, so the doctors decided to amputation so the patient would not get gangrene.

First, injured soldiers were brought to field stations near the battle. There, medical people gave the soldiers whiskey if they had it and put bandages on them. Then, the patients were taken to hospitals. The "hospital" could be only a barn or other building where the doctors had decided to work. They were not always organized well. There, the medical people did triage: they looked at the patient to plan what to do next. They divided patients into three groups: patients who were sure to die soon, patients who needed surgery and other patients. From there, some soldiers were sent to better hospitals in the bigger cities. Patients could be taken from place to place in different ways. General George B. McClellan started an ambulance corps in 1862, and the Confederacy soon made their own. There were also hospital trains, or steamboats called "sanitary steamers."

In 1861, the United States government (Union side, the North) created the U.S. Sanitary Commission to learn how to stop soldiers from becoming sick during wartime. Frederick Law Olmstead led the commission. He told the army to have clean camps, good food, and hospitals with ventilation.

Many doctors learned much about the human body, disease and injuries during the American Civil War. Many of them wrote down what they saw and did. Between 1870 and 1888, these doctors published a book, "Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion".

In 1861, Dorothea Dix became head of the United States Nursing Corps. Professional nursing became more important in the United States.

Bart of Darkness

"Bart of Darkness" is the first episode of The Simpsons 6th season. It was first broadcast on the Fox network on September 4, 1994. In the episode, Bart Simpson breaks his leg and must stay in his house. He starts spying on his neighbor Ned Flanders' house and starts to think he is a murderer. The episode was written by Dan McGrath and Jim Reardon is the director of the episode. It took more time to make the episode than normal because an earthquake hit while it was being made.

In a heat wave, Homer buys a swimming pool for his children Bart and Lisa. Many children from their neighborhood come to their house to go in their pool. Bart tries to jump in the pool from his tree house. Nelson makes him miss the jump and Bart breaks his leg from falling. He must wear a cast over the summer. 

The other children do not want to talk to Bart while he is in a cast. He makes himself stay in his room. He gets a telescope and uses it to spy on his neighbors. He hears a scream and sees Ned Flanders burying something. Bart starts to think he has murdered his wife Maude. While this happens, the swimming pool makes Lisa very popular. However, Martin Prince gets a bigger pool and gets all of the children to go to his pool.

Bart sees Ned tell his children Rod and Todd that Maude is "with God" and they will be with her soon. Bart thinks he will murder Rod and Todd too. Bart makes Lisa go to Ned's house while he is not there. Ned comes back and Lisa gets in his attic. Bart goes in Ned's house and sees him walking to the attic with an axe. Bart thinks he will hurt Lisa with it and tells him to stop. Ned sees Bart and Lisa and puts away his axe. When Bart tells Ned that he thinks he murdered Maude, Ned faints.

The Simpson family and the police learn that Maude was actually at a camp for Christians. They also learn that Ned was burying a plant that died because he gave it too much water. The police gets the plant and gets Ned to make the scream Bart heard before. Later, Martin's pool breaks because there were too many children in it.

"Bart of Darkness" was written by Dan McGrath and Jim Reardon is the director. The episode was suppose to be at the end of the 5th season. However, this and "Lisa's Rival" were being made during the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The earthquake hurt the building that animators and producers used to work on episodes. They could not go in the building for three months and had to work in a different building. Producers were given more time to work on the episode. Jim Reardon said the more time helped him put more details in the episode, for example, Bart getting stuck in a chair and him wearing underwear instead of a swimsuit.

At the start of the episode, the town of Springfield is in a heat wave. Part of what the Simpson family does in the heat wave was similar to what the producers would do in a heat wave. McGrath used to go in front of freezers when he was a child. In the episode, there is a truck with a pool in it that goes to the Simpson family's neighborhood. David Mirkin used to have a truck with an amusement ride in it around his neighborhood as a child. Ned Flanders' scream was done by Tress MacNeille instead of his voice actor Harry Shearer. Krusty the Clown does not say Ravi Shankar's name right in the episode. This was not suppose to happen, but Mirkin liked it and wanted to keep it in the episode.

Mike Duffy from the "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette" said the episode shows that "The Simpsons" was "just as strong and funny as it ever was". Elaine Liner from the "Corpus Christi Caller-Times" called the episode's writing "crisp" and "hilarious". Liner liked the references to pop culture and enjoyed when it was shown that Maude was at a camp for Christians. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood (authors of "I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide") thought it was hilarious to see how Ned Flanders was not actually a murderer. Tim Knight from Reel.com said it was a "terrific" episode to start the 6th season.

2021–22 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round

The 2021–22 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round began on 22 June and ended on 25 August 2021.

A total of 54 teams competed in the qualifying system of the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League, which includes the qualifying phase and the play-off round, with 43 teams in Champions Path and 11 teams in League Path. The six winners in the play-off round (four from Champions Path, two from League Path) advanced to the group stage, to join the 26 teams that enter in the group stage.

Times are CEST (), as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses).

The Champions Path includes all league champions which do not qualify directly for the group stage, and consists of the following rounds:

All teams eliminated from the Champions Path enter either the Europa League or the Europa Conference League:

Below are the participating teams of the Champions Path (with their 2021 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their starting rounds.

The League Path includes all league non-champions which do not qualify directly for the group stage, and consists of the following rounds:

All teams eliminated from the League Path enter the Europa League:

Below are the participating teams of the League Path (with their 2021 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their starting rounds.

Each tie, apart from the preliminary round, is played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scores more goals on aggregate over the two legs advance to the next round. If the aggregate score is level at the end of normal time of the second leg, the away goals rule is no longer applied starting from this season. To decide the winner of the tie, extra time is played, and if the same amount of goals are scored by both teams during extra time, the tie is decided by a penalty shoot-out. In the preliminary round, where single-match semi-finals and final are hosted by one of the participating teams, if the score is level at the end of normal time, extra time is played, and if the same amount of goals are scored by both teams during extra time, the tie is decided by a penalty shoot-out.

In the draws for each round, teams are seeded based on their UEFA club coefficients at the beginning of the season, with the teams divided into seeded and unseeded pots containing the same number of teams. A seeded team is drawn against an unseeded team, with the order of legs (or the administrative "home" team in the preliminary round matches) in each tie decided by draw. As the identity of the winners of the previous round is not known at the time of the draws, the seeding is carried out under the assumption that the team with the higher coefficient of an undecided tie advances to this round, which means if the team with the lower coefficient is to advance, it simply takes the seeding of its opponent. Prior to the draws, UEFA may form "groups" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they are purely for convenience of the draw and do not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition. Teams from associations with political conflicts as decided by UEFA may not be drawn into the same tie. After the draws, the order of legs of a tie may be reversed by UEFA due to scheduling or venue conflicts.

The schedule of the competition is as follows (all draws are held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland).

<section begin=PR />
The draw for the preliminary round was held on 8 June 2021, 12:00 CEST.<section end=PR />

A total of four teams played in the preliminary round. Seeding of teams was based on their 2021 UEFA club coefficients, with two seeded teams and two unseeded teams in the semi-finals. The first team drawn in each tie in the semi-finals, and also the final (between the two winners of the semi-finals, whose identity was not known at the time of draw), would be the "home" team for administrative purposes.

<section begin=PR />
The preliminary round matches, which consisted of two semi-finals on 22 June 2021 and the final on 25 June 2021, were originally to be played at Gundadalur, Tórshavn in the Faroe Islands, but were moved due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Faroe Islands. The matches were instead played in Albania, with the semi-finals at Elbasan Arena, Elbasan and Niko Dovana Stadium, Durrës, and the final at Elbasan Arena.

Falcata

Falcata is a Strategy game, developed and published by Gust, which was released in Japan in 1995. Falcata was one of the first games released on PlayStation in Japan, and for sure it was a strange one, the game is a mix between an strategy board game and a RPG game. In the game screen, the game draws a line connecting some different circles on a map, given a genuine and bizarre sense of atmosphere.

The falcata is a type of sword typical of Pre-Roman Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula, modern Spain and Portugal), similar to the Greek kopis or Nepalese kukri. The term Falcata is not ancient. It seems to have been coined by Fernando Fulgosio in 1872, on the model of the Latin expression ensis falcatus "sickle-shaped sword" (which, however, refers to the Harpe). He presumably went with falcata rather than falcatus because the Spanish word for sword espada is feminine, although there are other presumable theories. The name caught on very quickly, and is now firmly entrenched in the scholarly literature.

The game is set in 1500 BC in a land with different cities and hostile tribes, that makes most of the people to travel to other lands. The goal of the game is to restore the land so the people can stop their endless wandering, and finally arrived to that land and that will end with the tribal fights. The player's character will be the hero to reach that? Only time will tell.

The game features 6 different parties that can be customized in their clothes and hair, all of them with their own stats. The gameplay is about going around those places and examine them, in some of them you will have to fight and then the game takes the usual rpg style with turns to choose the proper actions that the player wants his characters to do. But instead of fights he can also pay to avoid the fights, make pacts or discover relics, etc.

Manufacturer's description:

Set in ancient Persia, simulation strategy of all parties ploy Mujin movement intertwined with free will. Become the leader of the party up to 5 people, and nurture a character and fighting bandits or find items to explore the field, encountered, we will proceed with the sabotage to the other party at times, prosperity Asutoran city of illusion I will win.

Hyappatsu hyakuchu

Hyappatsu hyakuchu (100発100中, "IronFinger") is a 1965 Japanese action adventure comedy film directed by Jun Fukuda and produced by Toho. The film was shot in color and cinemascope. When Akira Takarada appeared in "", released in 2004, he said "This is still a man who was said to be 100 out of 100 shots in the past. The line is about this work (by director Ryuhei Kitamura's plan). 

The story is about an ordinary holiday maker who takes up the mission of a dead Interpol agent and finds himself caught between two rival gangs who are fighting over an arms shipment.

On board the Air France plane ready to leave the Orly Airport there are two passengers. One is a second generation Japanese man born in who wears dark sunglasses. The other is a man who speaks French and Japanese. They began a conversation. The first began writing a letter to his mother while holding a picture of . He told her that he and his friend are going to to have a chat over there. The two traveled to Bangkok and without revealing their surnames. Two motorcycle assassins ambushed the two. The sunglasses man get caught with a rope and dragged on the street. The other takes out the first assassin while pulling out his to kill the second. 

The sunglasses man died in front of him. He is revealed to be an Interpol agent named Andrew Hoshino according to his passport. The other, now named as Andrew Hoshino, arrived at using his passport and plans to find out who killed the agent. A strange incident happened at the crowded airport. Andrew witnesses a stripper's makeup bag explode at the customs. A Chinese man escaped in the confusion as if he was looking for an opportunity. Andrew chases after him only to lose site of him as he gets in the car and leave. He meets Yumi Sawada, a beautiful woman who offers him a drive. She is a fashionable female bomb expert who sells plastic explosives in Southeast Asia. Guided by Yumi, Andrew arrived at the base of the Akatsuki Gang), a Yakuza crime syndicate led by Jyosuke Akatsuki and was taken prisoner. The Chinese man was actually a weapons dealer named Huang Changkang, who had been smuggling 100 CRS pistols (a re-modeled version of Mauser C96 pistols) from Hong Kong with the stripper in order to get rid of their competitors the Aonuma Gang under the leadership of yakuza boss Takeshi Aonuma. But Yumi has a more powerful weapon that she personally designed on her own, a that can explode anytime, anywhere with an .

Eventually, an agent from the International Secret Police was sent from Paris, and Tezuka, a bumbling over confident police detective from the , sneaked into the Akatsuki base to investigate an illegal weapon smuggling. But he ended up getting captured by Akatsuki's henchmen and taken to the basement where Andrew was tied up. The Akatsuki Gang, who was having problem with the two, moved them in a freezing box truck and headed for the with Yumi as the lookout. However, Tezuka flirts and teasing with the hot exchange between Hoshino and Yumi as lovers. Huang, who was angry about not getting half of the money from Jyosuke, sold 100 guns to the Akatsuki Gang and went to Takeshi where he sells 200 guns to the Aonuma Gang in exchange for telling about a deal with the Akatsuki's. Huang was told by Aonuma that Hoshino was a hitman dispatched from the Swiss trafficking kingpin de Balmeyer, and came to Japan in aiming for Huang with a French crime boss named Hubert Lebois, who was actually the leader of the weapon smuggling ring. 

However, Huang was relieved to know that Hoshino was captured by the Akatsuki Gang. Huang then informed of the location where the Akatsuki's would unload 100 guns. Andrew and Tezuka managed to escape while avoid being caught by the two gangs. Yumi, who saw that 100 crates full of CRS pistols were unlikely, started to fall in love with Andrew and saved them by setting up explosives around the beach catching the two gangs by surprise. Hoshino and Tezuka then began to search for Huang and Lubois. The trio began searching for Lebois, who had undergone plastic surgery in Italy. They learned of a stripper left behind by her manager, and Andrew and Tezuka were the same person as Lebois. Tezuka and his colleagues, who migrated to the CRS Special Investigation Headquarters, flew to Manila and started an investigation with the cooperation of the Manila City Police. Andrew was captured by Komori, a hitman for Aonuma, who came from Tokyo. He was placed on a Cessna 172 plane driven by Huang Changkang. Tezuka and Yumi immediately chased after the plane, but Huang Changkang descended with a parachute alone when Hoshino was tied up, unable to grab on to the control stick when Tezuka passed out. Huang was brutally killed when he went in the wrong direction and was cut by a spinning propeller. The two managed to help Andrew escape as the plane crashed into the jungle. 

Once they have landed in Manila, the three were surrounded by Filipinos and foreign guards led by Lebois. They were taken to his weapons factory. Lebois, who first appeared in front of the three, said that a sunglasses man named Andrew Hoshino should have killed Huang in Hong Kong, and was suspicious of the fake ICPO agent. He was imprisoned in the room by Lebois, who tried to torture Andrew and Tezuka for more information. He was saved by Yumi after she planted the explosives plastic behind the cellar. Hoshino, who carries his pistol against Lebois and his minions, contacted the Manila City Police. Weapon smuggler Lebois was defeated in a final battle with Andrew. He finally avenged his friend's death and completed his mission as an official Interpol agent. The movie ends with Andrew on a speedboat leaving Manila for Tokyo while Tezuka remained with the Manila police. Then out of nowhere, Yumi chased after Andrew and asked for a date.

Two Dozen and One Greyhounds

"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds" is the 20th episode of The Simpsons 6th season. It was first broadcast on the Fox network on April 9, 1995. The episode was written by Mike Scully and Bob Anderson is the director. In the episode, Santa's Little Helper mates with another greyhound at a race track. Mr. Burns wants to take their puppies to make a tuxedo out of them.

Santa's Little Helper, the Simpson family's dog, runs to a race track and mates with a greyhound there. The owner of the racing greyhound lets the Simpson family keep her. She gives birth to 25 puppies. Homer and Marge are not able to take care of the puppies and tries giving them away. Mr. Burns asks them for all of the puppies. Lisa does not want Burns to have them, but he takes the puppies when the family does not see them.

Bart and Lisa later learn that Burns has taken the puppies. They go to his mansion and see him cleaning the puppies in a bath. Burns sees one of the puppies standing up and calls the puppy "Little Monty". He then sings a song on how he will kill the other 24 puppies and make a tuxedo out of them. Bart and Lisa go in the mansion to try to get the puppies back. They put the puppies in the basement and find Burns there. Bart tries to make it so that Burns does not know which puppy is Little Monty. When Burns makes Little Monty stand, Bart uses a clothes line to make all of the puppies stand. Burns wants to kill all of the puppies and Bart and Lisa, but then thinks he should not kill them all. He instead puts all of the puppies in greyhound racing and gets millions of dollars from it.

"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds" was written by Mike Scully. Bob Anderson is the director of the episode. Al Jean and Mike Reiss came up with the story of the episode. They got the idea after seeing the movie "One Hundred and One Dalmatians". David Mirkin said as a joke that they like to take ideas from Disney. For example, another episode called "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious" is a parody of the movie "Mary Poppins". Mirkin thought it was great that they could use ideas from Disney in a "completely legal way".

Matt Groening (creator of "The Simpsons") was happy with the episode because it reminded him of the very first episode ("Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"). He also liked the references to "One Hundred and One Dalmatians". He liked the movie when he was a child and said it made him want to learn about animation and cartoons. In one part of the movie, the puppies can be seen watching cartoons on a television screen. Groening said that made him love how cartoons work and made him create a fictional television show in "The Simpsons" called "The Itchy & Scratchy Show".

In the episode, Mr. Burns says Little Monty reminds him of the actor Rory Calhoun. George Meyer got the idea for Mr. Burns to say that. Matt Groening did not want this in the episode because he thought people watching it would not know who Calhoun was. This was kept in because Calhoun would be talked about again during the end of the episode. After the episode was broadcast, Groening went on the Internet and saw discussions from people who did not know who Calhoun was.

When Bart and Lisa first go near Mr. Burns' mansion, they see him singing a song called "See My Vest". It is about how he will kill the puppies and make a tuxedo out of them. One writer came up with the idea that Mr. Burns will show the bad things he will do to the puppies with a "fun and light" song. Scully made the lyrics to the song on the next day. The lyrics are a parody of the song "Be Our Guest" from "Beauty and the Beast". Mirkin liked the song and said "The rhymes are really clever. It's one of our very best songs". He also liked that one song can be put in the episode without the episode becoming a musical. He said "We'll just do one song and that's plenty. We have fun with that and then we're out."

Animals in many cartoons may act like humans. Groening does not want this happening in "The Simpsons" and makes animals in the show act like real animals. This is how the animals in the episode act. Mirkin said they might not do this only for visual gags. Everything else has animals acting how they would in real life. Frank Welker made the animal sounds in the episode. Mirkin was happy with Welker's work and said "He can do anything, and it fits perfectly. You forget you're listening to a guy". Groening also thought he was very good at making animal sounds.

Producers and the people with Fox network's censors got into an argument if they should show Santa's Little Helper mating with the racing greyhound. Writers first thought it would not be a good idea, but Mirkin knew it could be shown without it being very sexual. In the episode, only the dogs' heads can be seen while they are mating. Storyboards of this part of the episode was later put on DVD. Anderson said that many people were laughing while the censors were looking at this part of the episode.

The song "See My Vest" was put in the album "Songs in the Key of Springfield". The "Daily Bruin" thought the song's lyrics were humorous and said that listening to it would give memories of the episode. They thought the song really showed Mr. Burns as a character and said it shows the "disturbing elements" of how humans act. MSNBC made a list of "TV's top 10 scariest characters" and put Mr. Burns on the top of the list. They talked about "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds" where Burns makes a plan on killing the puppies to make a tuxedo.

Ben Rayner from the "Toronto Star" thought that "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds" was one episode of "The Simpsons" he liked the most. He thought Mr. Burns in the "See My Vest" song was the most interesting part. The "Toronto Star" later made a list of the best and worst episodes of "The Simpsons". They put this episode as one of the best and said "See My Vest" was the best part of the episode. Todd Glichrist from IGN called the episode "memorable" and talked about "See My Vest" by saying Mr. Burns "flirts with copyright infringement". Michael Price from IGN thought the song was just a great as "The Monorail Song" from the episode "Marge vs. the Monorail". Colin Jacobson from DVD Movie Guide liked the references to many Disney movies and to Roy Calhoun. Jacobson said this made it a "fine show".


Breakthrough infection

There are diseases where there are vaccines. People who are vaccinated usually will not get the disease. In some cases, people who have been vaccinated will still catch the disease they have been vaccinated against. This is known as breakthrough infection. In some cases, vaccines do not provide immunity against the pathogen. Breakthrough infections have been described for diseases such as mumps, varicella (chicken pox), and influenza. For the person has been vaccinated, the disease will be different. Usually, the symptoms will be milder, and it may not last as long (compared to someone who has not been vaccinated).

There are different causes for breakthrough infections: The vaccine may not have been stored properly, or there may have been an error when the person was vaccinated. Viruses change over time. The vaccine may have been developed for another version of the virus, and it may not be as effective against the current version. Also, antibodies may block the vaccine. 

For these reasons, vaccines are not 100% effective: The common flu vaccine is estimated to provide immunity to the flu in 58% of those vaccinated. The measles vaccine fails to provide immunity to 2% of children that receive the vaccine. If herd immunity exists, it usually prevents individuals who are not vaccinated from contracting the disease. Herd immunity reduces the number of breakthrough infections.

In April 2021, the CDC reported that in the United States there were 5,814 COVID-19 breakthrough infections, and 74 deaths, among the more than 75 million people fully vaccinated for the COVID-19 virus.

As a person grows older, their immune system changes. This process is called immunosenescence. They will produce fewer naive T cells, and naive B cells. There is a reduced number of lymphocytes. In older people there are fewer lymphocytes, and there are also fewer types of lymphocytes that can respond to the pathogens in a vaccine. Many vaccines are less effective in older people. They should still get the flu vaccine. Influenza is particularly dangerous to them and the vaccine can provide at least some immunity to the influenza virus. 

Infants have antibodies from their mother. This limits the efficacy of many vaccines. Maternal antibodies can bind to the proteins produced by the virus in the vaccine. Maternal antibodies can neutralize the virus. The maternal antibodies help the immune system of the infant, which isn't very active yet: the infant produces fewer antibodies. This means that few memory B cells are produced. The level of memory B-cells is not enough to ensure an infant's lifelong resistance.

In most infants, maternal antibodies disappear twelve to fifteen months after birth. Vaccines given to infants older than 12-15 months are not affected by maternal antibody interference.

When a person is vaccinated against a disease, the person's immune system is triggered and memory B cells store the specific antibody response. These cells remain in circulation after the pathogen infection is cleared. Cell division is not perfect, so the information about the response slowly disappears. Usually, the cells live for decades. The lifespan and protection also depend on the type and dosage of the vaccine. The reason why some memory B cells live longer than others is unknown. It has been proposed that the differences are due to the speed at which a pathogen infects the body and the number and type of cells involved in the immune response to the pathogen in the vaccine.

When a person is vaccinated, their immune system develops antibodies that recognize specific parts of viruses or viral-induced proteins. Over time viruses accumulate genetic mutations which changes the structure of the viral proteins. If these mutations occur in sites that are recognized by antibodies, the mutations stop antibody binding. This phenomenon is called antigenic drift. Breakthrough infections of Hepatitis B and mumps are partially because of antigenic drift.

Sometimes, the vaccine that is used has a poor quality. Examples may be vaccines stored at the wrong temperature, or vaccines used after the expiration date. The correct vaccine dosage is essential. Vaccine dosage is dependent on factors including a patient's age and weight. Patients that get a lower dose than recommended of a vaccine do not have an adequate immune response to the vaccine to ensure immunity.

For a vaccine to work, a person must respond to the pathogens in a vaccine through the adaptive branch of the immune system and that response must be stored in an individual's immunological memory. It is possible for an individual to neutralize and clear a pathogen through the humoral response without activating the adaptive immune response. Vaccines with weaker or fewer strains of a pathogen may primarily cause the humoral response. Then they fail to ensure future immunity.

2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup

The 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup was the twentieth edition of the FIFA U-20 World Cup. The 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup took place for the first time in New Zealand.

Four FIFA member associations officially submitted their bids to host the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup by the deadline of 11 February 2011. On 3 March 2011, FIFA announced that the tournament would be held for the first time in New Zealand. This is the third FIFA competition staged in this country, after the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship and the 2008 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup.



Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin, Hamilton, New Plymouth, Wellington and Whangarei were the 7 cities chosen to host the competition.

Before the stadium announcements were made, Dunedin City council suggested in January 2013, that it would not bid to host matches at Forsyth Barr Stadium (also known as Otago Stadium) unless the costs (an estimated $1m) could be lowered. The stadium hosted seven matches there, the last of which being a Round of 16 game.
In addition to host nation New Zealand, 23 nations qualified from six separate continental competitions.

The final draw was held on 10 February 2015, 17:30 local time, at the SkyCity Grand, Auckland. For the draw, the 24 teams were divided into four seeding pots:


As a basic principle, teams from the same confederation could not be drawn against each other at the group stage. As the CAF U-20 Championship was not completed at the time of the draw, a separate draw took place on 23 March 2015 in Dakar, Senegal, at the tournament's conclusion to determine the groups where the 2nd, 3rd and 4th placed CAF teams would play in, to ensure there was no manipulation of games in the qualifying tournament ensuring fairness to all qualified teams.

The schedule of the tournament was unveiled on 20 November 2013.

A total of 21 referees, 6 support referees, and 42 assistant referees were selected for the tournament.

The 24 squads were officially announced by FIFA on 21 May 2015. Each participating national association had to submit a final list of 21 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) at least 10 days before the tournament started. These players were shortlisted from a provisional list of 35 players, including a minimum of four goalkeepers. All players must have been born on or after 1 January 1995. If a player listed in the final squad suffered a serious injury up until 24 hours before the kick-off of his team's first match, he could be replaced by a player from the provisional list with the approval of FIFA's medical and organising committees.

In July 2015, it was reported that the New Zealand squad had included an ineligible player, South African Deklan Wynne not having completed the requisite period of residence in New Zealand.

The winners and runners-up of each group and the best four third-placed teams advanced to the round of 16. The rankings of teams in each group were determined as follows:

If two or more teams were equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings were determined as follows:

All times are local, New Zealand Standard Time ().

The four best ranked third-placed teams also advanced to the round of 16. They were paired with the winners of groups A, B, C and D, according to a table published in Section 18 of the tournament regulations.

In the knockout stage, if a match was level at the end of regular time (two periods of 45 minutes), extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner. In the case of the third place match, as it was played just before the final, extra time was skipped and a penalty shoot-out took place if necessary.

The third-placed teams which advanced to the round of 16 were placed with the winners of groups A, B, C and D according to a table published in Section 18 of the tournament regulations.

The following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament. They were all sponsored by Adidas, except for the FIFA Fair Play Award.








The official emblem of the tournament was unveiled on 20 November 2013. The official mascot, a black sheep named Wooliam, was unveiled on 30 November 2014.

Prior to being released for 'General sale' on 13 June 2014, registered footballers in New Zealand were given 'priority treatment' by allowing them the option to buy tickets from two months earlier.

1976 Tangshan earthquake

The 1976 Tangshan earthquake () was a natural disaster resulting from a magnitude 7.6 earthquake that hit the region around Tangshan, Hebei, People's Republic of China on 28 July 1976. It lasted for 23 seconds and leveled 90 percent of Tangshan’s buildings. The earthquake came during the heat of midsummer, and many stunned survivors crawled out of their ruined houses naked, covered only in dust and blood. The earthquake started fires and ignited explosives and poisonous gases in Tangshan’s factories. Water and electricity were cut off, and rail and road access to the city was destroyed. It is the deadliest earthquake in China and one of the deadliest earthquakes in the world and is among the top ten deadliest natural disasters in China.

At the 3:42 a.m., an earthquake measuring between 7.8 and 8.2 magnitude on the Richter scale flattens Tangshan, a Chinese industrial city with a population of about a million people. The Chinese State Seismological Bureau (SSB) Analysis and Prediction Department was very accurate with the prediction of the earthquake, with an estimate of a major earthquake in the Tangshan region between July 22 and August 5. Despite voicing concerns, the prediction was not taken seriously. A few counties that listened to the advised saved thousands of lives by evacuating to safer areas days before the earthquake occurred.

According to the official statement from the seismological department, 242,000 people were killed and as many as 700,000 were injured. On the other hand, other resources claimed causalities as high as 650,000. More than 160,000 families were left homeless, and more than 4,000 children were orphaned 

Another reason why the death toll had increased to an extraordinary amount was because of the aftershocks that took place 16 hours after the first quake. The aftershocks were recorded to be as high as 7.1 on the Richter Scale, which not only hampered the rescue efforts but also added to the death toll. The Chinese government had not allowed foreign aid in the city, claiming that they were capable of handling the crisis on their own. In the crucial first week after the crisis, many died from lack of medical care. Troops and relief workers lacked the kind of heavy rescue training necessary to efficiently pull survivors from the rubble.

Homer then tells the family how he and Marge met. Their children do not want to listen and watch television while Homer and Marge kiss. 

This is the second clip show episode of "The Simpsons". The first clip show episode is "" from the 4th season. "Another Simpsons Clip Show" was written by Jon Vitti. He went with the name "Penny Wise" in the closing credits because he did not want to be known for writing the clip show. The episode was directed by David Silverman.

Stern, George Meyer, Conan O'Brien, Robert Cohen, Bill Canterbury, and Dan McGrath. The Fox network wanted the producers of "The Simpsons" to make clip shows. This was because they needed less money to make than a normal episode. Producers thought four episodes in each season should be clip shows. This was so that they would not be stressed out on making a season with more episodes than normal. However, this was not done becuase they thought fans would not like the clip shows. The Fox network thought this could happen at first because it would cost less to make a clip show but they would still get just as much money as a regular episode in syndication.

Many fans of "The Simpsons" think that clip shows are the worst episodes of the show. TV Squad thought that it was made in a way that was still "worth watching" and was similar to a slideshow, but "not quite as boring". Other critics said it was "not the worst" clip show and that "the episode title pretty much says it all". Colin Jacobson from DVD Movie Guide thought that the episodes shown were good but that the clip show was not necessary.

Lisa talks about how romance was taken in a "hostile takeover by Hallmark and Disney" and parts of it were later sold. This was used in studies on how organizations are shown in pop culture. The episode was talked about in Arab Strap's song "The First Big Weekend". One of the lyrics is "It was a really good episode about love always ending in tragedy except, of course, for Marge and Homer."

Functionalism (philosophy of mind)

Functionalism in the philosophy of mind is the doctrine that what makes something a mental state of a particular type does not depend on its internal constitution. But rather on the way it functions, or the role it plays, in the system of which it is a part. 
This doctrine is rooted in Aristotle's conception of the soul, and has antecedents in Hobbes's conception of the mind as a “calculating machine. But it has become fully articulated (and popularly endorsed) only in the last third of the 20th century. Though the term ‘functionalism’ is used to designate a variety of positions in a variety of other disciplines, including psychology, sociology, economics, and architecture, this entry focuses exclusively on functionalism as a philosophical thesis about the nature of mental states.

Conservative wave

The conservative wave (Spanish: "ola conservadora" Portuguese: "onda conservadora") or blue tide is a conservative political happening that started in the mid-2010s in Latin America. It was a reaction to the pink tide. The happening has been seen as declining since the late 2010s as as second pink tide has been seen happening.

After 10 years of left-wing government, the influence of the left began to decrease. In Argentina the conservative Mauricio Macri took the place of the Peronist Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in 2015. In Brazil there was Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached with Michel Temer taking her job in 2016. In Peru the conservative economist (person who studies economics) Pedro Pablo Kuczynski took the job of the President before him, Ollanta Humala. In Chile, the conservative Sebastián Piñera took the job of socialist Michelle Bachelet in 2018. In 2018 Jair Bolsonaro was elected President of Brazil, and in 2021, the conservative banker Guillermo Lasso was elected President of Ecuador.

These events in Latin America are similar to other happenings around the world, such as the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States in 2016. The increase of evangelicals in Latin America may have helped start up the conservative wave.

However in late 2010 and early 2020, the elections of left-wing presidents in Chile, Honduras, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico and Peru saw a comeback of the Pink tide and the end of the Conservative wave.

Below are right-wing and centre-right presidents who have held office in Latin America since 2010 during this wave. Centre-right presidents are marked with *.

The Swan Princess

The Swan Princess is a 1994 American-Russian animated musical movie. The movie has the voice talents of Jack Palance, John Cleese, Steven Wright and Sandy Duncan.

In the United States, "The Swan Princess" was distributed under New Line Cinema. Outside the United States, the distributor was DreamWorks Pictures.

"The Swan Princess" was released on November 18, 1994. The critics' reviews for the movie were mixed. It only took in $9.8 million over a $21 million budget. That meant the movie had a substandard box office intake. However, the movie later became popular with video releases. It has since received nine sequels, which were released in 1997, 1998, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.

The theme song "Far Longer than Forever" was sung by Regina Belle and Jeffrey Osborne. It was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 1995 for the Best Original Song.

Roger Ebert from the "Chicago Sun-Times" gave "The Swan Princess" three out of four stars. Gene Siskel, Ebert's fellow movie critic, gave the movie a substandard review. He labeled the songs in the movie weak. Under Rotten Tomatoes, "The Swan Princess" has a 50% approval rating.

Palaeognathae

The Palaeognathae, or paleognaths (from Ancient Greek "palaió-" "old" + "gnáthos" "jaw") is one of two living clades of birds: the other is the Neognathae. Together, the two clades make up the clade Neornithes. 

Palaeognathae includes five living branches of flightless birds (plus two extinct clades), called ratites, and one flying lineage, the Neotropic tinamous.

There are three extinct groups that are undisputed members of Palaeognathae: the Lithornithiformes, the Dinornithiformes (moas) and the Aepyornithiformes (elephant birds). 

Mesites

Mesites are small birds which only occur on Madagascar. They are flightless, or near-flightless. There are three species, in two genera. The IUCN has classified them as near-threatened. The IUCN estimates that there are only about 145.000 birds left. They look like doves.

The mesites are forest and scrubland birds that feed on insects and seeds. The brown and white-breasted mesites forage on the ground, gleaning insects from the leaves and under them, as well as low vegetation. The subdesert mesite uses its long bill to probe in the soil. Other birds, such as drongos and flycatchers, will follow mesites to catch any insects they flush and miss. Mesites are vocal birds, with calls similar to passerine song, used for territorial defence. Two or three white eggs are laid in a stick-nest located in a bush or low branch. The "Mesitornis" species are monogamous while "Monias benschi" is polygamous and unlike the other two shows significant sexual dichromatism.

There are two genera, "Mesitornis" (2 species) and "Monias" (subdesert mesite).

Historically, mesites phylogenetics relations were not very clear and have been allied with the Gruiformes, Turniciformes and Columbiformes.

Recent phylogenomic studies support Pterocliformes (sandgrouse) as the sister group of mesites while some more recent studies place this clade with another clade constituted of Columbiformes and Cuculiformes (cuckoos).

Bugchasing

Bugchasing is trying to get HIV through sex. People who try to get HIV are called bugchasers, and they are all men who have sex with men. It is not entirely understood why people try to get HIV, and bugchasing actions are hard to understand. It is rare.

Bugchasers are men who have sex with men and purposely try to get HIV. It is not understood why this happens. 

There are four common explanations.
First, it is thought that some men become bugchasers because they fear HIV infection, which had previously changed how they have sex. This can include things like men abstaining from sex entirely, only having sex with one person, or using sexual protection like condoms. Second, some men think having HIV is sexy. This means it can feel good to think about it, or that it is the ultimate taboo to overcome.
Third, bugchasers might think having HIV makes them part of a group.
And fourth, bugchasing might be an action against heteronormativity, the idea that everyone is heterosexual. The idea is that bugchasers do not achieve some expectations placed on them, including safe sex. There is a fifth possible reason—suicide—but this is not clear or very helpful.

Either way, people only rarely call themselves bugchasers, and they only try to get HIV even more rarely. This behavior does not entirely fit in with their identity. This means that bugchasing actions are rarely based on persons known to have HIV and having sex with them. Instead, a lot of bugchasers have sex in ambiguous situations, where they do not know if their partners have HIV. In 2005, researchers said there was no empirical evidence that bugchasing existed; they said that bugchasing as an idea and an activity existed, but it was rare.

Mermaid Prism

Mermaid Prism, is an visual novel video game for the PlayStation 2. The game was developed by Vingt-et-un Systems and published by D3 Publisher exclusively in Japan on October 26, 2006.

A visual novel is an interactive fiction game, featuring mostly static graphics, most often using anime-style art or occasionally live-action stills (and sometimes video footage). As the name might suggest, they resemble mixed-media novels. In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV), which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as "visual novels" by international fans. Visual novels and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006. Visual novels are distinguished from other game types by their extremely minimal gameplay. Typically the majority of player interaction is limited to clicking to keep the text, graphics and sound moving (most recent games offer "play" or "fast-forward" toggles that make even this unnecessary). Most visual novels have multiple storylines and many endings; the gameplay mechanic in these cases typically consists of intermittent multiple-choice decision points, where the player selects a direction in which to take the game.

Simple 2000 Series Vol.122 - The Ningyo Hime Monogatari - Mermaid Prism is a japanese dating sim, this female-targeted love simulation puts players in the role of a high school student that one day gets warped to a separate world, becoming a mermaid along the way!

Internationalist Theatre

Internationalist Theatre is a multi-racial and multi-national London theatre company founded by Angelique Rockas in April 1981 to perform great plays (usually cast with actors with standard English and cockney accents )performed by actors from all races and nationalities performing in their own country`s accent. "The Stage". The company was originally named New Internationalist Theatre.

Resistance to diversity casting was expressed by 'Time Out ' magazine with regard to 'Mother Courage', "the casting only inspires a whole host of irreverent questions: what on earth, say, is an American sergeant doing in seventeenth century Europe? And how did a Pakistani chaplain get into the Swedish army?" The Pakistani actor referred to was the Asian Parsi actor Renu Setna. The "Financial Times" questioned 'Liolà'`s multi-national casting "do we really need this peculiar medley of Italian accents for the English premiere? The problem is compounded by the commitment ... to a multi-national cast ... English, German, Sicilian, and Italian actors produce widely differing versions of the Latin lilt".
Internationalist Theatre was granted charity status in 1986.



"Internationalist Theatre staged dramas written in " continental, non-realistic, symbolically orientated drama of this century (20th) and ... proved most uncongenial to the tunnel visioned repertoire builders" of British theatre of that period." Nicolas de Jongh, "The Guardian"

At the deadline date of 17 January 2011, three member associations confirmed they would be bidding for the event. Neither Turkey nor Uzbekistan had ever been hosts to a FIFA competition, while the United Arab Emirates were hosts of the U-20s in 2003.


In addition to host nation Turkey, 23 nations qualified from six separate continental competitions.
To mark the one year countdown date to the competition, FIFA, as well as members of the Turkish FA, announced that the emblem would be presented to the media on 25 June 2012 at Ciragan Palace Mabeyn Hall in Istanbul. Details of the ticketing access were made publicly available on 30 November 2012.

The mascot for the tournament was called Kanki, a blue-eyed Kangal puppy.

The official theme song for the tournament was "Yıldızlar Buradan Yükseliyor", which is translated as "Building Bridges for Rising Stars", performed by Turkish rock band Gece.

The final draw was held at the Grand Tarabya Hotel in Istanbul on 25 March 2013, at 19:00 .

On 12 February 2013, FIFA announced the procedure of the draw. The 24 teams were divided into four differing pots:


Prior to the draw, Turkey was assigned to position C1, and Spain was assigned to Group A. As a basic principle, teams from the same confederation could not be drawn against each other at the group stage, except in Group A where there were two teams from UEFA.

As the CAF U-20 Championship was not completed at the time of the draw, a separate draw took place at the tournament's conclusion on 30 March in Oran, Algeria to determine the groups where the second, third and fourth-placed CAF teams would play in.
The 23 referee trios were announced by FIFA on 13 May 2013.
Teams had to name a 21-man squad (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by the FIFA deadline. The squads were announced by FIFA on 14 June 2013.

The winners and runners-up from each group, as well as the best four third-placed teams, qualified for the first round of the knockout stage (round of 16).

The ranking of each team in each group was determined as follows:

The Hunchback of Notre Dame: Topsy Turvy Games

It was the second title in the company's GameBreak! series after GameBreak! Timon and Pumbaa's Jungle Games. Tiertex adapted the game for SNES, Game Boy, and Super Game Boy, which were published by THQ.

Mobygames describes the gameplay thus:It starts with a colourful, really animated, and festive introduction. The environment is the Notre Dame Cathedral front yard, where the festival and games take place. Sounds and music from the movie are always there. The games are presented by those three funny Disney's gargoyles, which may also give some support. Games can be played by one or two players bringing more fun when with family and friends. Escalating levels challenge players of all ages! But there is also an option for difficulty. Riddles, cream battles, bowling, are some of the topics of the games included.

"Coming Soon" Magazine gave the game 87 out of 100, concluding "Although Hunchback of Notre Dame was first designed for children, the game might appeal as well for adults with its remarkable design. Not only do the graphics look sterling, but also the soundtrack plays admirably with the original music from the film. At no time you will get bored in the game. The hilarious commentaries from the gargoyles will keep you awake, and even the loading sequences feature small animations. Rarely has a game for children been so well made, and no doubt it will be another smash hit for Disney Interactive." "Entertainment Weekly" described it as having less "charm and originality" than Savoy Pictures' "The Adventures of Pinocchio", ultimately giving it a B-

Electric Playground gave the game a score of 8 out of 10.

This was confirmed by Tulisa herself when she invited the contestants from her category on "The X Factor" to join her at the video shoot, and behind the scenes footage of the video was featured on the show. Shortly after, on 21 October 2012, the full official music video premiered via Tulisa's official VEVO account on YouTube.

Turaco

The turacos make up the bird family Musophagidae ( "banana-eaters"), which includes plantain-eaters and go-away-birds. In southern Africa both turacos and go-away-birds are commonly known as loeries. They are semi-zygodactylous: the fourth (outer) toe can be switched back and forth. The second and third toes, which always point forward, are conjoined in some species. Musophagids often have prominent crests and long tails; the turacos are noted for peculiar and unique pigments giving them their bright green and red feathers.

Traditionally, this group has been allied with the cuckoos in the order Cuculiformes, but the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy raises this group to a full order Musophagiformes. They have been proposed to link the hoatzin to the other living birds, but this was later disputed. Recent genetic analyses have strongly supported the order ranking of Musophagiformes.

Musophagidae is one of very few bird families endemic to Africa. Another order, which is also endemic to Africa are the mousebirds, Colliidae. All turaco species are frugivorous, but they also eat leaves, buds, and flowers. Figs are an important part of their diet. They have rounded wings and long tails and strong legs, making them poor fliers, but good runners.

Turacos are medium-sized arboreal birds endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, where they live in forests, woodland and savanna.

They are gregarious, non-migratory birds which move in family groups of up to 10. Many species are noisy, with the go-away-birds being especially noted for their piercing alarm calls, which alert other fauna to the presence of predators; their common name is onomatopoeia of this. Musophagids build large stick nests in trees, and lay twp or three eggs. The young are born with thick down and open, or nearly-open, eyes.

Elia Suleiman

Elia Suleiman (, ; born July 28, 1960) is a Palestinian film director and actor of Rûm Greek Orthodox origin. He is best known for the 2002 film "Divine Intervention" (), a modern tragic comedy on living under occupation in Palestine which won the Jury Prize at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. Elia Suleiman's cinematic style is often compared to that of Jacques Tati and Buster Keaton, for its poetic interplay between "burlesque and sobriety". He is married to Lebanese singer and actress Yasmine Hamdan.

Between 1982 and 1993, Suleiman lived in New York City, where he co-directed: "Introduction to the End of an Argument" (1990) and directed "Homage by Assassination". Both won numerous awards.

An experimental video film, co-directed by Jayce Salloum, "Introduction to the End of an Argument" critiqued the portrayal of Arabs in Western media and its effect on foreign policy by juxtaposing clips from Hollywood films, television broadcasts and cartoons with live scenes (shot by Salloum) from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

"Homage by Assassination" is a "diary film" that critiques the 1991 Gulf War via the juxtaposition of multilayered personal anecdotes and identity. The film offers a lucid portrait of what critics Ella Shohat and Robert Stam have termed "cultural disembodiment," manifested in "multiple failures of communication," that reflect the contradictions of a "diasporic subject."

In 1994, Suleiman moved to Jerusalem and began teaching at Birzeit University in the West Bank. He was given the task of developing a Film and Media Department at the university, with funding support from the European Commission. In 2008 Elia Suleiman became a professor at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee. He continues to guest lecture in other universities around the world.

In 1996, Suleiman directed "Chronicle of a Disappearance", his first feature film. It won the Best First Film Prize at the 1996 Venice Film Festival.

In 2002, Suleiman's second feature film, "Divine Intervention", subtitled, "A Chronicle of Love and Pain", won the Jury Prize at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and the International Critics Prize (FIPRESCI), also receiving the Best Foreign Film Prize at the European Awards in Rome.

The third film in his trilogy is called "The Time That Remains", which competed in the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Suleiman won the Black Pearl prize for best Middle Eastern narrative film at the Middle Eastern Film Festival in Abu Dhabi on October 17, 2009. The film won the Critics' Prize from the Argentinean Film Critics Association at Mar del Plata International Film Festival.

His latest film, "It Must Be Heaven", competed in the 2019 Cannes Film Festival and had its North American premiere at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival.

In his 1998 film, "The Arab Dream" ("Al Hilm Al-Arabi") Suleiman autobiographically explores issues of identity, expressing that: "I don't have a homeland to say I live in exile... I live in postmortem... daily life, daily death." Suleiman also produced a short film in 1997, entitled "War and Peace in Vesoul".

In 2000, Suleiman released the 15-minute short film "Cyber Palestine" which follows a modern-day Mary and Joseph as they attempt to cross from Gaza into Bethlehem. Suleiman was part of the nine-person jury for the 2006 Cannes Film Festival.

Spirit of London

19000 "Spirit of London" is an Alexander Dennis Enviro400 double-decker bus which was first used in London in October 2005. Originally using fleet number 18500, "Spirit of London" was built as the replacement for the bus destroyed in Tavistock Square during the 7 July 2005 London bombings, killing 13 passengers. "Spirit of London" was also the first production Enviro400 built by Alexander Dennis. Throughout its time in service, "Spirit of London" has served as a tribute to the victims of the 7/7 attacks.

On 7 July 2005, there were 4 bombings across public transport in London. One of them was in Tavistock Square on a bus, the two-year-old TransBus ALX400-bodied TransBus Trident double-decker bus, registration LX03 BUF and fleet number 17758, operated by Stagecoach London. It would be scrapped after the attacks.

"Spirit of London" was first shown to the public on 3 October 2005. It was the first production Enviro400 to be built; the Enviro400 was Alexander Dennis' successor to the Dennis Trident and Alexander ALX400. It was originally assigned Stagecoach fleet number 18500, which is otherwise used for Trident-based vehicles. After a long promotional tour, "Spirit of London" went into use on route 30 in January 2006, five months after the Tavistock Square attack had occurred on the same route. 

In the early hours of 19 October 2012, the bus would be set on fire by two teenage girls. The fire would cause damage over £60,000. Due to the special status of it as a reminder of the 7/7 attacks, Stagecoach London decided to repair it.

Rabbids

Rabbids, also known as Raving Rabbids and in France as Lapins crétins ("moronic rabbits"), is a video game franchise published by Ubisoft. It originated as a spin-off video game from the "Rayman" series, 2006's "Rayman Raving Rabbids", and is centered on a fictional species of mischievous rabbit-like creatures known as Rabbids, who speak gibberish and scream wildly whenever they experience an adrenaline rush. The series consists mainly of party video games, though other genres have been explored as well.

The earliest "Rayman 4" trailers depicted menacing rabbits, simply appearing from underground with a blank stare in various shapes and forms, smaller eyes and furry. At this point, trailers showed the game as an adventure game with fight stages, where Rayman would need to punch and kick himself kung fu style through a horde of zombie-bunnies. As the game concept evolved, from one of a central objective to minigames, a series of viral videos were created by Marketing Manager Adrian Lacey and Animator Charles Beirnaert which became incredibly successful on the new media platform YouTube. The rabbits slowly evolved into various merchandising products such as the Rabbid figures, which were much more conscious and amusing, changing from merely being enemies to fight through into more memorable characters with various traits and quirks. "Rayman" creator Michel Ancel described the bunnies as "vicious, but at the same time [...] totally stupid".

In a video interview, project lead Loïc Gounon confirmed the possibility of splitting the Rayman and Rabbid series apart, mentioning that the Rabbids "managed to hit a bit more adult and a bit more older audience than the previous Raymans". By 2009's "Rabbids Go Home", Rayman does not make an appearance; when asked about the omission of Rayman during an interview about "Rabbids Go Home", director Jacques Exertier provided an assurance that Rayman would return for more action-adventure video games.

The music style for the franchise was created by composer Mark Griskey. Mark worked with Audio Director Yoan Fanise to define the comedic style of the early games and the style was continued with the further versions of the franchise.
Rabbids – Rabbids are wild rabbit-like creatures who like to cause havoc and mischief on Rayman's world (where they came from), the human world, and others and are gibberish speaking and yell "BWAH!" whenever they experience adrenaline rushes. They were originally the antagonists; however, due to increase in popularity, they became the protagonists in "Rabbids Go Home". A notable Rabbid who first appeared in "Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle" is Rabbid Peach.

Rayman – the main protagonist of the first three games. He always foils the Rabbids' evil plans. When the Rabbids became the protagonists of the franchise, Rayman was dropped, but continues to appear in his own games.

Professor Barranco III – the supreme leader of the Rabbids who planned out all of their invasions on Rayman's world, Earth and others. He is seen in the games "Rayman Raving Rabbids 2", "Rabbids: Travel in Time" and "Rabbids: Alive and Kicking" as the main antagonist (despite having a minor role in RRR 2 and RTiT). He is one of the rare smart Rabbids to exist, but can be easily fooled as well. In RAaK he has a Rabbid scientist as his second in command, who would later go on to become a major character in the TV series.

Serguei – Serguei is the main villain of "Rayman Raving Rabbids". He is a large, black rabbid who abducted Rayman and the Globox kids and forced them to take part in the Rabbids Olympics filled with deadly challenges. In the end, Rayman manages to escape and free most of the Globox kids. It is unknown what happens to Serguei at that point, though his absence in further games suggest that he was relieved of his duties due to failure in keeping Rayman.

The Semi-Leaders – the Semi-leaders are fat, lazy and angry Rabbids who serve as the secondary antagonists of "Rayman Raving Rabbids 2". They constantly force the Rabbids to bring them food and don't do pretty much anything other than sitting or lying around and keeping things in check. They each have different themes in clothing.

The Rabbids have made several appearances in games outside of their own series or the Rayman franchise. In "Red Steel", the Rabbids appear as enemies in one of the game's later stages. The Wii version of "" includes three different types of Rabbids as playable characters, along with a stage based on "Rabbids Go Home". Toys of the Rabbids appear as hidden easter eggs in "" and "Watch Dogs". In "", a cheat can be used to turn the game's enemies into Rabbids. The song "Here Comes the Hotstepper" in "Just Dance 2" includes a Rabbid who attempts to dance with the choreographer. Similarly, the alternate version of the song "Naughty Girl" in the Nintendo Switch version of "Just Dance 2018" via "Just Dance Unlimited" subscription service includes Rabbid Peach from "Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle" as the main choreographer. "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate" features three Rabbids from "Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle" as unlockable spirits and a Rabbid Mii Fighter hat was available as downloadable content on January 28, 2020. On April Fools' Day 2019, "For Honor" featured a limited time event in which Rabbids replaced all of the game's characters. In 2021, they have been featured in "The Crew 2" as their own LIVE Summit Event, as well as introducing two vanity cosmetic items into the game. The first is roofrack of a Rabbid hanging on to it and the second being a window tint full of Rabbids which can only be acquired by scoring platinum in the LIVE Summit.

In October 2010, Ubisoft and Aardman announced a partnership to produce a TV series pilot and several shorts based on the franchise. One year later, it was announced that 78 7-minute CG animated episodes would be made solely by Ubisoft Motion Pictures, and broadcast as 26 half-hour episodes by Nickelodeon on August 3, 2013.
In early 2012, Ubisoft Motion Pictures called on the French animation studio TeamTO to create most of the CGI parts of the series.
On E3 2013, it was announced that it would be an interactive Xbox One show entitled "Rabbids Invasion". The show aired for three seasons on Nickelodeon from August 3, 2013 through June 23, 2017. On July 1, 2019, a fourth season was released on Netflix.

A live-action/animated movie based on the franchise was in the works by Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment. However, in 2019, Lionsgate and Ubisoft signed a deal to produce the Rabbids movie with Todd Strauss-Schulson in talks to direct the movie with Todd Lieberman and David Hoberman as producers. It is now being developed by Lionsgate, Ubisoft Motion Pictures, Mandeville Films, and Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, with Matt Senreich, Tom Sheppard, and Zeb Wells set to write the film, while revised by Todd Rosenberg.

A comic book series based on the franchise has been released in France, Belgium and Switzerland. All comic strips are drawn by the French cartoonist Romaine Pujol and written by Thithaume. There are ten volumes thus far.

Aside from video games and the comic book series mentioned above, the Rabbids also have other merchandising such as T-shirts, figurines, plush toys, school equipment, fan club magazines, and for a limited time, a Happy Meal toy. A "Raving Rabbids" themed version of the card game "Jungle Speed" was also released in France.

The Rabbids franchise has also been licensed for the out-of-home entertainment market such as the recent collaboration with arcade game manufacturer LAI Games to produce Virtual Rabbids: The Big Ride, an attendant-free VR attraction.

The "Rabbids" series, along with its titular characters, have become very popular. IGN has stated that the Rabbids have "more personality and charisma than 10 of the most popular video game mascots combined", and that the bunnies have literally "upstaged Rayman himself".

GameSpot noted that the Rabbids themselves are "almost exclusively responsible for [selling the game's humor], as they are, without a doubt, hysterical. They're adorably designed, with their dumb stares, high-pitched shrieks, and a penchant for taking comedic bumps."

It is a medium-large bird, living in forests and woodlands in Madagascar and the Comoro Islands. Three subspecies are described: the nominate "L. d. discolor" is found in Madagascar and Mayotte Island, "L. d. intermedius" on Anjouan, and "L. d. gracilis" of Grand Comoro. Based on its smaller size, differences in the plumage, and minor difference in the voice, the last of these is sometimes considered a separate species, the Comoro cuckoo roller ("L. gracilis").

Vietnamese Australians

Vietnamese Australians () are Australians who have ancestors who were originally Vietnamese, or people who went to Australia from Vietnam. Communities of overseas Vietnamese are referred to as Việt Kiều or "người Việt hải ngoại".

Up until 1975 there were fewer than 700 Vietnam-born people in Australia. After the takeover of South Vietnam by the North Vietnamese communist government in April 1975, Australia, being a signatory to the "Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees", agreed to resettle its share of Vietnam-born refugees under a plan to resettle refugees between 1975 and 1985. After the early intake of refugees in the late 1970s, there was a second immigration wave in 1983–84, most likely a result of the 1982 agreement between the Australian and Vietnamese governments (the "Orderly Departure Program") which allowed relatives of Vietnamese Australians to leave Vietnam and move to Australia. A third immigration wave in the late 1980s seems to have been mainly due to Australia's family reunion scheme.


1755 Lisbon earthquake

The 1755 Lisbon earthquake was a major earthquake that hit Portugal and the rest of the Iberian Peninsula on 1 November 1755. The earthquake caused serious damage to Lisbon. It killed an estimated 60,000 people in Lisbon alone. Violent shaking destroyed about 12,000 homes. Because November 1, when the quake struck, was All Saints' Day, many people were attending mass at the time of the quake. Churches collapsed and many people died.

The earthquake caused a tsunami that produced waves about 20 feet (6 metres) high in Lisbon. Shocks from the earthquake were felt throughout Europe. The disaster became an important event in European history.


Blacksmith tree frog

The blacksmith tree frog or smith frog ("Boana faber") is a frog that lives in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. Scientists have seen it between 64 and 1035 meters above sea level.

Vietnamese Americans

Vietnamese Americans () are Americans who have ancestors who were originally Vietnamese. They make up about half of all overseas Vietnamese () and are the fourth-largest Asian American ethnic group after Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, and Indian Americans. There are 2.2 million people of Vietnamese descent residing in the U.S.

The Vietnamese community in the United States was very small until the South Vietnamese immigration to the country after the Vietnam War which ended in 1975. Early immigrants were refugee boat people, loyal to South Vietnam in the conflict who left political persecution or wanted better jobs. More than half of Vietnamese Americans reside in the two most populous states of California and Texas, mostly in their large urban areas.

In 2019, the median household income for all Vietnamese Americans was $69,800, compared to $85,800 for all Asian Americans. Divided by birth, the income was $82,400 for US-born and $66,000 for Vietnamese-Americans born in other countries.

In 2017, 10.6% of Vietnamese Americans lived under the poverty line, lower than the poverty rate for all Americans at 12.3%.

The U.S. Census Bureau reports in 2016 among working Vietnamese Americans (citizen employed population 16 years and over): 32.9% had management, business, science, and arts jobs; 30.9% had service jobs; 17.0% had office jobs, 4.3% had natural resources, construction, and maintenance jobs; and 15% had natural resources, construction, and maintenance jobs.

Though Vietnamese immigration has continued at a fairly stable pace since the 1980s, the pathway to immigration for Vietnamese today has shifted entirely. As the opposite to the earlier history of Vietnamese migration that mostly came from refugees, an overwhelming majority of Vietnamese are now given LPR on the basis of family sponsored preferences or by way of close family to U.S. citizens, at 53% and 44% respectively.

In 2019, 55% of American born Vietnamese Americans had gotten a bachelor's degree or higher.

In 2019, 90% of US-born Vietnamese Americans were able to speak English.

The Vietnamese parents consider children's good school performance as a source of happiness for their family, encouraging their children to do well in school and to enter professional jobs as the way to get a better life. Vietnam's traditional Confucianist society values schools and learning, and many Vietnamese Americans have worked their way up from menial labor to have their second-generation children and go to college and become better. Compared to other Asian immigrant groups, Vietnamese Americans are more hopeful about their children's future; forty-eight percent believe that their children's standard of living will be better than theirs.

A number of colleges have a Vietnamese Student Association, and an annual conference is hosted by the Union of North American Vietnamese Student Associations for current or future members.

The teams are invited national teams composed of youth players from U-17 to U-23 level. The tournament is named after Maurice Revello, who started the tournament in 1967. The first tournament in 1967 featured club teams, but it changed to national teams in 1975 (except in 1986 and 1989 when INF Vichy was invited). The tournament is held around Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, with the final being held in Toulon itself.

The Toulon Tournament usually was played with two 40-minute halves. In 2019 every match consisted of two periods of 45 minutes each. In a match, every team has eleven named substitutes and the maximum number of substitutions permitted is four.

In the knockout stage, if a game tied at the end of regulation time, extra time is not played and the penalty shoot-out is used to determine the winner.

Cube (algebra)

In mathematics, a cube of a number means the result of multiplying the number by its square. For example, the cube of 6 is 6×6×6 = 216.

It is named this because cubing a number gives the volume of a cube.

Cubing a number can also be written as 6 = 36. Cubing is the same as raising to the power of 3.

Many of the units of volume are cubes. For example, a "cubic meter" means the volume equal to the volume of a cuboid which is one meter tall, one meter wide, and one meter deep.
This is a list of cube numbers from 1^3 to 10^3


Cube (disambiguation)

A cube is a shape with six equal faces, twelve equal edges and eight equal corners.

Divisibility rules

Divisibility rules of whole numbers are very useful because they help us to quickly determine if a number can be divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 10 without doing long division. This is especially useful when the numbers are large.

Any integer that is not a fraction is divisible by 1.

Eg:- 23, 84, 974, 1023

If a number is an even number or a number whose last digit is an even number.

Eg:-  0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10

When the sum of all digits of a number is a multiple of 3.

Eg:- 516, 36, 119, 5502

When the number formed by last 2 digits is divisible by 4.

Eg:- 92, 780, 52, 300

When the ones digit of the number is either 0 or 5.

Eg:- 55, 125, 1000, 760

A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by 2 and 3 also.

Eg:- 270, 630, 144, 42

When the difference between twice the digits at ones place and the number formed by other digit is either zero or a multiple of 7.

Eg:- 1073, 98, 56, 140

The number formed by last 3 digits is divisible by 8.

Eg:- 1792, 1824, 2000, 2880

When the sum of all digits of a number is a multiple of 9.

Eg:- 51984, 2979, 9000, 135

When the ones digit is zero.

British Pakistanis

British Pakistanis (; also known as Pakistani British people or Pakistani Britons) are citizens or residents of the United Kingdom whose ancestors came from Pakistan. The community is well into its third generation and consists of around 1.8 million individuals, the second-largest Pakistani population living outside of Pakistan, after the United Arab Emirates. It includes people born in the UK who are of Pakistani descent and Pakistani-born people who have went to the UK. Most British people of Pakistani origin were born in the United Kingdom, as opposed to Pakistan itself. Most British Pakistanis are originally from the Azad Kashmir and Punjab regions, with a smaller number from other parts of Pakistan including Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.

The UK is home to the largest Pakistani community in Europe, with the amount of British Pakistanis living there exceeding 1.8 million based on the 2011 census. British Pakistanis are the second-largest racial minority population in the United Kingdom and also make up the second-largest sub-group of British Asians. They are also one of the largest overseas Pakistani communities, similar in number to people who have Pakistani heritage in Saudi Arabia.

Pakistanis have been present in the UK since the start of the 19th century, but by far the largest wave of migration occurred right after the Second World War. The historical relations between both countries goes through the British Empire from the region that is now Pakistan started in small numbers in the mid-19th century. Parts of what is now Pakistan was then ruled by the British Raj. People from those regions were soldiers in the British Indian Army. and some were deployed in other parts of the British Empire.

Major Pakistani migration to the United Kingdom began in the early 1900s, the British Empire formally annexed the region in 1850, with the residents of British-ruled Pakistan becoming subjects of The Crown. Some started to immigrate during the colonial rule in the 1920s, but immigration increased during the 1950s and 1960s. After the Second World War, the break-up of the British Empire and the independence of Pakistan made Pakistani immigration to the United Kingdom go up, especially during the 1950s and the 1960s. That was made easier as Pakistan was a member of the Commonwealth. Pakistani immigrants helped to sort out the job shortages in the British steel, textile and engineering industries. Doctors from Pakistan were recruited by the National Health Service in the 1960s.

The number of British Pakistanis has grown from about 10,000 in 1951 to over 1.1 million in 2011. Most live in England, with some in Scotland and smaller numbers in Wales and Northern Ireland. The most diverse group of Pakistani people is in London and has Punjabis, Mirpuri Kashmiris, Pashtuns, Sindhis, Muhajirs, Saraikis, Baloch and others.
Most British Pakistanis are Muslim; around 90 percent of those living in England and Wales at the time of the 2011 census said that their religion was Islam. Most are Sunni Muslims, but there are also many Shia Muslims. The UK also has one of the largest overseas Christian Pakistani communities; the 2011 census recorded around 17,000 Christian Pakistanis living in England and Wales, which was 1.52 percent of the Pakistanis there.
Since their settlement, British Pakistanis have had many different contributions and influence on British society, politics, culture, economy and sport. Social issues include high relative poverty rates among the community according to the 2001 census, but some progress has been made in recent years, with the 2011 census showing British Pakistanis as having some the highest levels of home ownership in Britain.

Traditionally, many British Pakistanis have employed themselves, with many working in the transport industry or the retail sector's family-run businesses.

The Home Office believes the recording was edited after the suicide attacks and dismisses it as evidence of al-Qaeda's involvement in the bombing. In the film, Khan declares, "I and thousands like me have forsaken everything for what we believe" and refers to his expectation that the media would already have painted a picture of him in accordance with government "spin". He goes on to say, "Your democratically elected governments continually perpetrate atrocities against my people all over the world. Your support makes you directly responsible. We are at war and I am a soldier. Now you too will taste the reality of this situation."

Shehzad Tanweer

Shehzad Tanweer (15 December 1982 – 7 July 2005) was one of four Al Qaeda terrorists who exploded bombs in three trains on the London Underground and one bus in central London during the 7 July 2005 London bombings. 56 people were killed and over 700 hurt in the attacks.

Tanweer was named by Scotland Yard as the man who exploded a bomb while travelling towards the east on the Circle Line between Liverpool Street and Aldgate, killing both himself and seven of the 56 killed in total in the attacks. The other three men were found out to be Hasib Hussain, Germaine Lindsay, and Mohammad Sidique Khan. They all died in the explosions they set off.

On 6 July 2006, a video statement by Tanweer was published by Al-Jazeera. In the video, which included statements by al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, Tanweer said:

"What have you witnessed now is only the beginning of a string of attacks that will continue and become stronger until you pull your forces out of Afghanistan and Iraq. And until you stop your financial and military support to America and Israel." Tanweer argued that the non-Muslims of Britain deserve such attacks because they voted for a government which "continues to oppress our mothers, children, brothers and sisters in Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq and Chechnya" 

Tanweer's statements was clearer in making this link with British foreign policy than Mohammad Sidique Khan, the person thought to be the lead bomber. The video has also served to confirm thoughts that both Khan and Tanweer had contact with Ayman Al-Zawahiri and other senior figures in the Al-Qaeda organisation while in Dubai.

A few days before the bombing, Tanweer rented a red Nissan Micra from a local car-rental agency. His hair was also bleached due to the hydrogen peroxide he was using prior to the attack.

On 7 July, Tanweer, Khan, Hussain, and Lindsay are believed to have picked up the bombs from a house in the Leeds, hiding them in their rucksacks, then to have driven to Luton, Bedfordshire in the red Nissan, which he left parked in Luton railway station car park.
In Luton, the men went on the 07:23 Thameslink train, arriving at King's Cross in London at around 08.20 hours, where they went different ways and exploded their bombs.

The three London underground bombs exploded within 60 seconds of each other at 8:50 a.m.Tanweer travelled towards the east on the Circle line from Kings Cross, exploding his bomb on train number 204 between Liverpool Street and Aldgate stations, also killing at least seven people. The police found his body parts in the carriage he blew up.

After the bombings, police found other bombs in Tanweer's car, which would be dealt with by an explosive police team.

Emasculation

Emasculation is also used metaphorically to refer to the loss of a man's masculinity. A man is said to be emasculated when he loses, or is deprived of, a characteristic traditionally associated with being a man, such as power or independence. It is the removal of both the penis and the testicles, the external male sex organs. It differs from castration, which is the removal of the testicles only. Throughout the Indian subcontinent tradition, including India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, some members of the Hijra community reportedly undergo emasculation, or "nirvan." For the Hijra, emasculation does affect a recipient's gender identity, with some identifying as female, non-binary, or a third gender.

Anastasia (daughter of Constantius I)

Anastasia () was a Roman woman of the Constantinian dynasty (a line of rulers who governed the Roman Empire during Late Antiquity). Anastasia was the daughter of the Roman emperor ConstantiusI, the half-sister of the emperor Constantine the Great, and the wife of Bassianus.

Anastasia's mother was Flavia Maximiana Theodora, the wife of Constantius I. (It is also possible that Anastasia was the daughter of Helena, mother of Constantine I, and not a daughter of Maximiana Theodora.)

Anastasia was written about by the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus and the writer of the "Anonymus Valesianus", a Latin history. The "Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae" says that Roman baths in Constantinople (the Romans' capital city) had Anastasia's name. Anastasia's name () may mean that her father had sympathy for Christian or Jewish culture.

There is no evidence that any of Constantius's daughters married before their father died. Anastasia's sister Constantia may have been the first to marry, and may have been the oldest of the siblings. Constantia married in 313. Anastasia herself married Bassianus in 316 or in 314. At that time, Anastasia's half-brother Constantine was emperor. He planned to make Bassianus (a junior co-emperor). Anastasia's brother-in-law Licinius (Constantine's junior co-emperor) did not want this to happen, and Bassianus did not become . After this Constantine executed Bassianus. The "Anonymus Valesianus" says that Bassianus's execution was because Bassianus planned treason. What became of Anastasia is unknown. The encyclopaedia "Brill's New Pauly" says that Anastasia "must have still been alive" when Constantine built the city of Constantinople, because of the Roman baths there with her name ().

In the 5th century, the Greek historians of Socrates Scholasticus and Sozomen both wrote that the got their name from another Anastasia, a daughter of the emperor Valens. This information is not correct.

White stork

The white stork ("Ciconia ciconia") is a large bird in the stork family, Ciconiidae. Its plumage is mainly white, with black on the wings. Adults have long red legs and long pointed red beaks. They are on average from beak tip to end of tail, with a wingspan. 

The stork breeds in Europe, northwestern Africa, and Asia (east to southern Kazakhstan) and southern Africa. 

The white stork is a long-distance migrant. It winters in Sub-Saharan Africa to South Africa, or on the Indian subcontinent. When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing the Mediterranean Sea and detours via the Levant in the east or the Strait of Gibraltar in the wes. The air thermals on which it depends for soaring do not form over water.

A carnivore, the white stork eats a wide range of animal prey, including insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals and small birds. It takes most of its food from the ground, among low vegetation, and from shallow water. 
Though monogamous, the birds do not pair for life. Pairs build a large stick nest, which may be used for several years. Each year the female may lay a clutch of four eggs, which hatch roughly 33–34 days after being laid. Both parents take turns incubating the eggs, and both feed the young. The young leave the nest 58–64 days after hatching, and are fed by the parents for another 7–20 days.
